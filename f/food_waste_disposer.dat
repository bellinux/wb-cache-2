40|$|In this study, a tank-connected <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposer</b> {{system with}} the {{objective}} to optimise biogas production and nutrient recovery from food waste in Malmo was evaluated. The project investigated the source separation ratio of food waste through waste composition analyses, determined the potential biogas production in ground food waste, analysed the organic matter content and the limiting components in ground food waste and analysed outlet samples to calculate food waste losses from the separation tank. It can be concluded that the tank-connected <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposer</b> system in Malmo {{can be used for}} energy recovery and optimisation of biogas production. The organic content of the collected waste is very high and contains a lot of energy rich fat and protein, and the methane potential is high. The results showed that approximately 38 % of the food waste dry matter is collected in the tank. The remaining food waste is either found in residual waste (34 % of the dry matter) or passes the tank and goes through the outlet to the sewer (28 %). The relatively high dry matter content in the collected fraction (3 - 5 % DM) indicates that the separation tank can thicken the waste substantially. The potential for nutrient recovery is rather limited considering the tank content. Only small fractions of the phosphorus (15 %) and nitrogen (21 %) are recyclable by the collected waste in the tank. The quality of the outlet indicates a satisfactory separation of particulate organic matter and fat. The organic content and nutrients, which are in dissolved form, cannot be retained in the tank and are rather led to the sewage via the outlet. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{modified}} Ludzack-Ettinger (MLE) type membrane bioreactor (MBR) {{as a method}} of treatment for wastewater from <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposer.</b> Micro-membrane filtration allows for an extremely low concentration of suspended solids in the effluent. The effluent of the reactor in question is characterized by a relatively high level of non-biodegradable organics, containing a substantial amount of soluble microbial products and biomass. Results obtained in this paper by measurement of membrane fouling are consistent with biomass concentration in the reactor, as opposed to chemical oxygen demand (COD). The MLE process is shown to be effective for the treatment of wastewater with a high COD/N ratio of 20, resulting in are markedly high total nitrogen removal efficiency. Denitrifica-tion could be improved at a higher internal recycle ratio. Despite the low concentration of influent phosphorus, the phosphorus concen-tration of the outflow is seen to be relatively high. This is because outflow phosphorous concentration is related to COD consumption, and the process operates at along solids retention time...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{alternatives}} {{when it comes}} to remediation of food waste. In recent years focus has been shifting towards maximizing the energy potential of food waste. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess various food waste effluents generated by a <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposer</b> (FWD) for impact on COD, nitrate, and phosphorous. Another goal was to review findings from past studies and compare current food waste diversion practices by method, energy yield potential, and greenhouse gas emissions. Food waste diversion alternatives assessed include landfilling & incineration, food waste disposers, and composting. Food wastes were collected and characterized based on availability and the USDA?s MyPlate food grouping system. A control sample of tap water and 39 food waste samples were processed individually through a FWD. The effluent produced by each sample was collected and tested separately using Hach testing kits for COD, nitrate, and phosphorous. In analysis of COD test results it was concluded foods from the Grains Group and the Dairy Group caused the greatest concentration increases. This was also true for nitrate testing. It was also found the Grains Group showed the highest deviation for COD testing. It should be noted, however, some foods within the Grains Group caused an observed decrease in concentration in COD testing. Foods from the Dairy Group caused a significantly higher increase in phosphorous concentration than foods from any other group. However, the Dairy Group showed the highest deviation for both nitrate and phosphorous testing...|$|E

For this purpose, the operational and economic impacts of food disposers on the solid waste and wastewater streams are assessed. The integration of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposers</b> can reduce the total solid waste to be managed by 12 to 43 % under market penetration ranging between 25 and 75 %, respectively.

40|$|When {{assessing}} {{the environmental and}} human health impact of a municipal food waste (FW) management system waste managers typically rely {{on the principles of}} the waste hierarchy; using metrics such as the mass or rate of waste that is &# 039;prepared for recycling,&# 039; &# 039;recovered for energy,&# 039; or &# 039;sent to landfill. &# 039; These metrics measure the collection and sorting efficiency of a waste system but are incapable of determining the efficiency of a system to turn waste into a valuable resource. In this study a life cycle approach was employed using a system boundary that includes the entire waste service provision from collection to safe end-use or disposal. A life cycle inventory of seven waste management systems was calculated, including the first service wide inventory of FW management through kitchen in-sink disposal (<b>food</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposer).</b> Results describe the mass, energy and water balance of each system along with key emissions profile. It was demonstrated that the energy balance can differ significantly from its&# 039; energy generation, exemplified by mechanical biological treatment, which was the best system for generating energy from waste but only 5 th best for net-energy generation. Furthermore, the energy balance of kitchen in-sink disposal was shown to be reduced because 31 % of volatile solids were lost in pre-treatment. The study also confirmed that higher FW landfill diversion rates were critical for reducing many harmful emissions to air and water. Although, mass-balance analysis showed that the alternative end-use of the FW material may still contain high impact pollutants...|$|E
40|$|An {{unconventional}} {{system for}} separate collection of food waste was investigated through evaluation of three full-scale {{systems in the}} city of Malmö, Sweden. Ground food waste is led to a separate settling tank where food waste sludge is collected regularly with a tank-vehicle. These tank-connected systems {{can be seen as a}} promising method for separate collection of food waste from both households and restaurants. Ground food waste collected from these systems is rich in fat and has a high methane potential when compared to food waste collected in conventional bag systems. The content of heavy metals is low. The concentrations of N-tot and P-tot in sludge collected from sedimentation tanks were on average 46. 2 and 3. 9 g/kg TS, equalling an estimated 0. 48 and 0. 05 kgN-tot and P-tot respectively per year and household connected to the <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposer</b> system. Detergents in low concentrations can result in increased degradation rates and biogas production, while higher concentrations can result in temporary inhibition of methane production. Concentrations of COD and fat in effluent from full-scale tanks reached an average of 1068 mg/l and 149 mg/l respectively over the five month long evaluation period. Hydrolysis of the ground material is initiated between sludge collection occasions (30 days). Older food waste sludge increases the degradation rate and the risks of fugitive emissions of methane from tanks between collection occasions. Increased particle size decreases hydrolysis rate and could thus decrease losses of carbon and nutrients in the sewerage system, but further studies in full-scale systems are needed to confirm this...|$|E
40|$|In Scotland and the UK, <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> from {{industrial}} kitchens is commonly disposed to sewers via <b>Food</b> <b>Waste</b> <b>Disposers</b> (FWD).

40|$|An {{increased}} interest for separate collection of household <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> in Sweden {{has led to}} development {{of a number of}} different collection-systems - each with their particular benefits and drawbacks. In the present study, two systems for collection of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> in households were compared; (a) use of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposers</b> (FWD) in kitchen sinks and (b) collection of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> in paper bags for further treatment. The comparison was made in relation to greenhouse gas emissions as well as primary energy utilization. In both cases, collected <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> was treated through anaerobic digestion and digestate was used as fertilizer on farmland. Systems emissions of greenhouse gases from collection and treatment of 1 ton of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> (dry matter), are according to the performed assessment lower from the FWD-system compared to the reference system (- 990 and - 770 kg CO 2 -eq. /ton <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> dry matter respectively). The main reasons are a higher substitution of mineral nitrogen fertilizer followed by a higher substitution of diesel. Performed uncertainty analyses state that results are robust, but that decreasing losses of organic matter in pre-treatment of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> collected in paper bags, as well as increased losses of organic matter and nutrients from the FWD-system could change the hierarchy in relation to greenhouse gas emissions. Owing to a higher use of electricity in the FWD-system, the paper bag collection system was preferable in relation to primary energy utilization. Due to the many questions still remaining regarding the impacts of an increased amount of nutrients and organic matter to the sewage system through an increased use of FWD, the later treatment of effluent from the FWD-system, as well as treatment of wastewater from kitchen sinks in the reference system, {{was not included in the}} assessment.

40|$|The use of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposers</b> (FWDs) {{can be an}} {{interesting}} option to integrate the management of municipal wastewaters and household organic waste in small towns and decentralized areas. This strategy can be even more environmentally friendly if a suitable treatment process of the resulting sewage is performed {{in order to control}} nutrients emission. However, still nowadays, part of the scientific and technical community considers the application of this technology a possible source of problems. In this study, the FWDs were applied, with a market penetration factor of 67 %, in a mountain village of 250 inhabitants. Further, the existing wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) was upgraded by applying an automatically controlled alternate cycles process for the management of nutrients removal. With specific reference to the observed results, the impact of the ground <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> on the sewerage system did not show particular solids sedimentation or significant hydraulic overflows. Further, the WWTP was able to face the overloads of 11, 55 and 2 g per capita per day of TSS, COD and TN, respectively. Then, the increase of the readily biodegradable COD (rbCOD/COD from 0. 20 to 0. 25) and the favourable COD/TN ratio (from 9. 9 to 12) led to a specific denitrification rate of some 0. 06 kg NO 3 -N/(kg MLVSS day). Therefore, not only COD removal, but also the total nitrogen removal increased: the denitrification efficiency reached 85 %. That led to a better exploitation of the nitrogen-bound oxygen and a consequent reduction of energy requirements of 39 %.

40|$|Among the {{numerous}} approaches to <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> treatment, the <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposers</b> method (FWDs), as a newcomer, has become slowly {{accepted by the}} general public owing to the worries about its impact on the existing sewage system. This paper aims to justify the role of FWDs in the process of urbanization in order to better prepare a city to take good care of the construction of its infrastructure and the solid waste treatment. Both the literatures and the case study help to confirm that FWDs has no negative effects on the wastewater treatment plant and it is also environmental friendly by reducing the greenhouse gas emissions. In the case study, the Lappeenranta waste water treatment plant has been selected in order to figure out the possible changes to a WWTP following the integration of FWDs: the observation shows only minor changes take place in a WWTP, in case of 25 % application, like BOD up 7 %, TSS up 6 % and wastewater flowrate up 6 %, an additional sludge production of 200 tons per year and the extra yield of methane up to 10000 m 3 per year; however, when the utilization rate of FWD is over 75 %, BOD, TSS, and wastewater flowrate will experience more significant changes, thus exerting much pressure on the existing WWTP. FWDs can only be used in residential areas or cities equipped with consummate drainage network within the service sphere of WWTP, therefore, the relevant authority or government department should regulate the installation frequency of FWDs, while promoting the accessory application of FWDs. In the meanwhile, WWTP should improve their treatment process in order to expand their capacity for sludge treatment so as to stay in line with the future development of urban waste management...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{resource}} saving is particularly relevant for household waste removal systems and sewage networks in modern residential houses. Some {{options for the}} shared use of sewage networks and natural organic waste removal systems in residential buildings are assessed by the author. Layouts, operation patterns and elements of the systems are provided. Strengths of shared operation of the systems and networks are analyzed with account for the present-day requirements applicable to the systems in question. The positive factor is that residents {{do not need to}} spend money for expensive <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposers</b> for their homes. They will also use garbage chutes in their houses. Joint operation of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> removal systems and domestic sewage networks will reduce the load on landfills which has been increasing in the recent years. It will increase the load on urban sewage networks and water treatment facilities, but it will not be a critical factor, because treatment facilities are capable of purifying water without much difficulty. Processed <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> may be applied to produce fertilizers and biogas to be used as fuel. Therefore, benefits of the limited use of landfills are obvious. Waste shredding is the most convenient, efficient and nature friendly way of processing the organic waste at the initial stage of its generation. It prevents rotting typical for the organic waste if disposed together with the municipal solid waste. The experience of the United States, where <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> is treated by in-sink food erators and removed into the sewage system is less expensive for city budgets than their disposal at landfills. <b>Food</b> <b>wastes</b> consist mainly of the water (70 %); therefore, water treatment facilities assure a more natural way of processing this type of waste than waste collection and disposal. Separation of organic waste from solid waste also reduces the number of disease vectors such as flies, rodents, and cockroaches.

40|$|The {{impacts of}} changes in {{domestic}} wastewater inputs on sewer performance have been debated {{since the dawn of}} the great sewer construction movement in the 1850 s. Nowadays, typical household wastewater that enters sewers can generally be divided into streams from the WC, shower and/or bathtub, kitchen sink, washing machine and dishwasher. Changes in thecomposition of domestic wastewater entering a sewer will depend on inter alia the properties of the appliances used in the households and householders’ residential habits. Recent such changes with a potentially detrimental impact on sewer performance are increased levels of fat, oil and grease used in kitchen practices; the introduction of kitchen sink <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> disposers;and the installation of domestic water efficient appliances. The overall aim of this thesis was, from an historical perspective, to explore how recent changes to inputs in domestic wastewater can impact performance of sewer systems and how this relates to sewers as future carriers of domestic wastewater. Various methods to examine the aim have been employed. Two questionnaire surveys were distributed. The first was sent out to sewer operators/managers employed at Scandinavian public water utilities to explore their views on the extent of fat, oil and grease in sewer systems. The second was sent to sewer/operators managers employed at public water utilities in Northern Sweden to explore the extent of monitoring of incidents of blockages. Two field studies have also been undertaken. One entailed the investigation of long term impacts on sewer performance from the introduction of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposers</b> in housing areas. The other evaluated which parameters of domestic wastewater could be used to estimate levels of infiltration/ inflow into sewers. In addition, a case analysis was undertaken to assess future impacts on self-cleansing regimes in sewer networks when rural subarctic villages are retrofitted with water efficient appliances. A literature review was performed to identify and analyse studies examining changes to domestic wastewater the impact these changes may have on sewer systems,and their implications for sewer management. Responses from the first questionnaire survey suggested that an increase in blockages due tofat, oil and grease, in particular at pumping stations, was the most reported problem. Responses from the second questionnaire survey indicated that the extent of monitoring reoccurring blockage locations was found to be low, although two water utilities possessed GIS-systems which supported such endeavours. The first field study indicated that the level of in-sewerdeposition was observed to be increased when a pipe received high input of effluents from the kitchen sink disposers. This was observed to a further degree when a pipe had a gentle inclination combined with significant sagging along its length. From the second field study it was found that among compounds normally sampled to determine wastewater characteristic, the parameters Tot-N and Tot-P provided the closest fit to estimated levels of infiltration/inflowbased on water consumption rates. The case analysis indicated that the decrease in in-pipe velocities when all households are retrofitted with water saving appliances could be counteracted by sewer relining when water consumption rates did not drop below 130 l/hd. d. The impacts on sewer performance from these changes seemed to be dictated by many factors,e. g. household practices and the status of separate pipes. Therefore {{there is a need to}} put the changes to inputs in the context of larger societal trends to properly understand their full implications regarding future objectives when relying on the sewer as a carrier of domestic wastewater.

40|$|Recycling {{of plant}} {{nutrients}} in sewage products to arable land {{is regarded as}} a step towards a more sustainable society, as today’s use of scarce resources is a threat to future generations. Sewage sludge is the predominant sewage fertiliser product available today. However, the use of sewage sludge in agriculture is a controversial issue. Blackwater from separating systems seems to fulfil agricultural requirements on a fertiliser product to a higher degree than sewage sludge without many of the hazardous substances in sludge. The main objective {{of this study was to}} analyse environmental impact and resource use in systems integrating wastewater management and agriculture. The methodology used was based on LCA methodology. Three different wastewater systems were evaluated together with the agricultural production potentially affected. The first alternative (the Surahammar reference system) represented a system that a large part of the population in Surahammar is connected to today. <b>Food</b> <b>waste</b> <b>disposers</b> were installed in 50 % of the households, wastewater was treated in a conventional wastewater treatment plant and the sewage sludge was used for production of a soil conditioner. The second alternative (the sludge utilisation system) symbolised a wastewater system more commonly represented in Swedish municipalities, and included also agricultural use of the sewage sludge. The third alternative (the blackwater system) was based on a future vision of Surahammar. Here, toilet water from low-flush vacuum toilets and milled organic waste were digested separately. The blackwater product was stored and spread in growing oats, thereby replacing mineral fertilisers. Data on the wastewater system were derived from simulations by the substance-flow model URWARE/ORWARE. Assumed conditions for the agricultural system were mainly based on site-specific data from a farm producing according to the Svenskt Sigill label. All energy used and all emissions were related to a functional unit. The functional unit included wastewater treatment for 8830 persons in Surahammar, disposal of the sewage products and production of 2100 tonnes of oats on 486 hectares. As regards the operating phase of the whole system, the blackwater system required less fossil fuel and electricity than the other two systems. Although the blackwater system required considerably more fossil fuel for collection and transport, the total use of fossil fuel was lower due to a reduced need for mineral fertiliser. Construction of storage tanks and pipes for the blackwater system may, however, give a considerable contribution to the total environmental load. Including the construction phase too revealed that the use of fossil fuel increased considerably and was highest from the blackwater system. The emissions of greenhouse gases were of the same magnitude for all three systems, although slightly lower for the blackwater system. This was also evident when the construction phase was considered. The eutrophying emissions were reduced considerably in the blackwater system according to a maximum scenario, mainly due to reduced emissions of ammonium from the treatment plant. The emissions of SO 2 were of the same magnitude for all three systems studied, although slightly lower for the sludge utilisation system, As regards NH 3 and NOx, the emissions were highest for the blackwater system. A high substitution of mineral fertiliser, an optimal spreading technique and an appropriate design of the system for collecting and storing the blackwater were highlighted as important for many environmental aspects in the blackwater system...|$|R

The capacities of the three strategic landfills in Hong Kong are going to be exhausted soon. Therefore, new policy strategies are needed to combat the <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> problem. A questionnaire was conducted with residents in the Tuen Mun district of Hong Kong, which focused on finding out their level of awareness of the <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> problem in Hong Kong; general behaviours of handling and generation of food waste; views and attitudes towards recycling <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> and perceived need for a household <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> recycling scheme in Hong Kong. The findings show that the majority of the respondents have a high level of awareness of the <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> problem in Hong Kong. However, the general behaviour of handling and generation of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> does not seem to be in keeping with a reduction of <b>food</b> <b>waste.</b> There are a number of hindering factors that discourage <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> reduction and <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> recycling, such as the lack of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> recycling facilities, hygiene and public health issues, and other social issues such as convenience.

Using theory of planned behaviour (TPB), two conceptual models of factors that influence consumers’ <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> behaviour was developed. A first aim {{of this study is to}} fill the empirical gap of quantitative methods on <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> behaviour in restaurants. The second aim is to develop a model to explain what underlying factors cause <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> behaviour in restaurants. That can be a basis for reduced <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> behaviour. Environmental attitudes and environmental beliefs turned out to be the strongest predictors of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> behaviour. Moral norms also affect environmental attitudes. Other factors influencing consumers’ <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> behaviour in restaurants are: situational factors and intention to avoid <b>food</b> <b>waste.</b> MSc in Marketing and Consumptio...|$|R
40|$|Domestic <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> is {{a concept}} that {{recently}} has gained {{a lot of interest in}} the waste management industry. While people’s daily practices have converged more cultural and social symbols with <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> and keep re-defining and re-constructing the domestic <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> system, <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> then has emerged as a way to explain the real meaning hidden behind the everyday practices. By studying literature, conducting ethnographic fieldwork, as well as using cultural and anthropological theory to analyze empirical materials, my ambition is to answer the following questions: What and how do people define <b>food</b> <b>waste?</b> As the subject, do the human beings have a power over the domestic <b>food</b> <b>waste?</b> Though being generated by humans, does domestic <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> hold power over people? How does this power relationship influence people and domestic <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> in the daily practice?

40|$|In the {{framework}} of ethical consumerism, the interest for <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> and <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> prevention is steadily growing. A significant portion of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> is created at the household level, therefore consumer behavior and its psychological antecedents are very important in relation to this timely issue. Drawing on the Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen 1991), the current study investigated whether the intention to reduce household <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> could be predicted by attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control. Moreover, research aims to investigate the effect of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> habits on intentions to reduce <b>food</b> <b>waste.</b> Do habits influence the future intention to reduce <b>food</b> <b>waste?</b> If this is the case, is this effect direct, or rather mediated by attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control, as the TPB would predict? Finally, we were interested to test {{the effects of a}} set of key concerns emerged in a recent study (La Barbera et al., 2016) on the <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> habit. Results show that the TPB constructs adequately predict participants’ future intention to reduce <b>food</b> <b>waste.</b> In line with the TPB, <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> habit indirectly affects future intention through the mediation of attitude and perceived behavioral control. Finally, we found that the concern related to the negative environmental consequences of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> is the only one which significantly affects <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> habit.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis reports on the research undertaken to increase the sustainability of the management of industrial <b>food</b> <b>waste.</b> The main objective {{of this research is}} to develop a systematic framework that can be used by food manufacturers to identify and implement sustainable solutions for <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> management. The research reported in this thesis is divided into four main parts. The first part reviews the literature on ramifications and issues associated with the generation and management of <b>food</b> <b>waste,</b> available options to tackle issues related to <b>food</b> <b>waste,</b> categorisations of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> and existing methodologies to support <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> management modelling and decision-making with regard to the management of <b>food</b> <b>waste.</b> The second part introduces a framework to identify types of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> and link them to their most sustainable <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> management solution. The third part presents a <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> management modelling procedure and identifies attributes needed to model <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> management. The fourth part analyses relationships between attributes and provides information flowcharts and a methodology to support the modelling of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> management systems. The applicability and usefulness of the research have been demonstrated through case studies with two UK food manufacturers: a brewery and a meat-alternative manufacturer. Although the framework presented in this thesis aims at improving <b>food</b> manufacturers <b>waste</b> management, it could be easily adapted to be used in other stages of the food supply chain. In summary, the research reported in this thesis has concluded that food manufacturers generate large amounts of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> that are managed {{in a wide range of}} ways. A systematic framework to analyse types of <b>food</b> being <b>wasted,</b> <b>waste</b> management processes, <b>food</b> manufacturers, <b>waste</b> management processors and sustainability implications of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> management provides a sound methodology to identify opportunities to improve the management of industrial <b>food</b> <b>waste...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{unprecedented}} {{scale of}} <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> in global <b>food</b> supply chains is attracting increasing attention {{due to its}} environmental, social and economic impacts. Drawing on interviews with <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> specialists, this study construes the boundaries between food surplus and <b>food</b> <b>waste,</b> avoidable and unavoidable <b>food</b> <b>waste,</b> and between waste prevention and waste management. This study suggests that the first step towards a more sustainable resolution of the <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> issue is to adopt a sustainable production and consumption approach and tackle <b>food</b> surplus and <b>waste</b> throughout the global food supply chain. The authors examine the factors {{that give rise to}} <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> throughout the <b>food</b> supply chain, and propose a framework to identify and prioritize the most appropriate options for prevention and management of <b>food</b> <b>waste.</b> The proposed framework interprets and applies the waste hierarchy in the context of <b>food</b> <b>waste.</b> It considers the three dimensions of sustainability (environmental, economic, and social), offering a more holistic approach in addressing <b>food</b> <b>waste.</b> Additionally, it considers the materiality and temporality of <b>food.</b> The <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> hierarchy posits that prevention, through minimization of food surplus and avoidable <b>food</b> <b>waste,</b> is the most attractive option. The second most attractive option involves the distribution of food surplus to groups affected by food poverty, followed by the option of converting <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> to animal feed. Although the proposed <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> hierarchy requires a fundamental re-think of the current practices and systems in place, {{it has the potential to}} deliver substantial environmental, social and economic benefits. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Although consumers are the single biggest contributor to this volume, {{little is known about}} the drivers of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> in households. This exploratory study aims to investigate the role of food choices and other food-related activities in producing <b>food</b> <b>waste.</b> A survey of 244 Romanian consumers examined the influence of intentions not to <b>waste</b> <b>food,</b> planning and shopping routines, as well as moral attitudes and lack of concern towards <b>wasting</b> <b>food,</b> a subjective norm of disapproval towards <b>food</b> <b>waste,</b> and perceived behavioural control on consumers’ self-reported <b>food</b> <b>waste.</b> Results show that consumers’ planning and shopping routines are important predictors of <b>food</b> <b>waste.</b> Planning and shopping routines are determined by moral attitudes towards <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> and perceived behavioural control. This implies that in order to change consumers’ <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> behaviour, efforts should be directed towards providing consumers with skills and tools to deal with their food-related activities...|$|R

40|$|Recently, <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> {{issue has}} been raised by many {{environmental}} friendly organizations, there are approximately 3, 584 tons <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> produced in Hong Kong every day. <b>Food</b> <b>waste</b> originates from commercial and industry (C&I) sector and domestic sector that about 11 % and 28 % respectively of the municipal solid waste (MSW) generated in Hong Kong. <b>Food</b> <b>waste</b> leads to many pollution problems, as <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> contains a lot of moisture, during the decomposing process, the <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> will release landfill gas and leachate, it will contaminate environment of nearby area of landfills. Furthermore, every day about 9, 000 tons MSW will be disposed to landfills, based on the government information, the landfill of Tseng Kwan O will be saturated on 2015, while the other landfills in Tuen Man and Ta Kwu Ling will be saturated in 2017 and 2019 respectively, and MSW will become a big issue for Hong Kong. Currently, Hong Kong has only one Pilot Composting plant in Kowloon bay to recycle 500 tons <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> daily from C & I sectors. And for households sector, only a few housing estates have on-site composting machines to recycle the <b>food</b> <b>waste,</b> most of the domestic <b>food</b> <b>wastes</b> are disposed to landfills. To encourage the on-site <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> recycling within housing estates, the ECF has launched a funding program “Food waste Recycling Projects in Housing Estates” in 2011.

40|$|The {{creation}} of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> {{is an issue}} of increasing importance given growing concerns about environmental sustainability. Until recently the <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> literature has focused on the amount of <b>food</b> <b>wasted</b> with little consideration 0 f the practices that create <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> beyond households and hospitals. This thesis seeks to consider <b>food</b> and <b>waste</b> practices as they occur within a catering kitchen with an aim of exploring how <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> is created. Exploring the {{creation of}} <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> in catering occurred through participant observation in a catering firm in Palmerston North, New Zealand during the summer of 2013 - 14. Information gathered through this technique centred on following food journeys through the catering kitchen and the moments of transition which occur as <b>food</b> becomes <b>waste.</b> Concepts of ‘becoming’ and ‘assemblages’ (Deleuze and Guattari, 1988) were drawn on to understand <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> creation, with Hetherington’s (2004) concept of conduits to inform how becomings take place. Analysis of field notes demonstrated that creating <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> in catering is not a simple process, nor a certain outcome. Instead <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> occurs as part of a vast interconnected web of interactions between food, places, people, and ideas. Conduits exist to change meaning and value inherent in food. Those conduits to avoid <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> can be found as buckets for pig feed, storage in a chiller to be made into a new dish, or staff consumption. The use of these conduits can reduce <b>food</b> <b>waste,</b> but the capacity of food to enter them is constrained by the economic and material realities of producing food for sale. Staff at the catering firm desire to reduce <b>food</b> <b>waste,</b> but time and space pressures, kitchen practices regarding <b>food</b> and <b>waste,</b> external regulations, and the material properties of food means that, while reducing <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> is desirable, it is not always possible...|$|R
40|$|<b>Food</b> <b>waste</b> is a {{major problem}} in industrialized nations. In order to develop {{efficient}} mechanisms for minimization, {{a better understanding of the}} complexities involved in <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> is necessary. This chapter takes a marketing system perspective to provide a holistic exploration of the edible <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> phenomenon on a retail and wholesale store level. By means of 32 in-depth interviews with store managers, we gain insights into the relevance of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> occurrence, avoidance, and redistribution. The data reveals various factors influencing the occurrence of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> along formal, informal, and philosophical antecedent classes. We find that managing edible <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> is closely connected to the triple bottom line: reducing its occurrence and enabling processes to redistribute edible <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> can create economic, ecological, and social benefits. Against this background, we propose a dormant sustainability potential in the management of <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> and advance recommendations for realizing these benefits. We suggest that <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> is a key priority area in the realm of corporate social responsibility for retail and wholesale organization. The chapter draws on a framework for public policy change and provides a discussion about how different processes can help reduce edible <b>food</b> <b>waste</b> among various market actors...|$|R
