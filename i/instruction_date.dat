30|$|The various essays {{about the}} history of Instructional Design (e.g., Leigh 1998; Reiser 2001; Schrock 1995) agree on the {{assumption}} that the beginnings of systematic planning of <b>instruction</b> <b>date</b> back to the 1920 s. Across the following five decades different approaches of instruction emerged to respond to changing requirements of the American educational system. In the 1950 s, three strong movements influenced the field of instructional planning: (a) Skinner’s theory of operant conditioning and reinforcement, (b) Bloom’s taxonomy of educational objectives for the cognitive domain (Bloom et al. 1956), and (c) the cybernetic approach of systems theory, which turned out to be most influential within the realm of instructional science (Seel and Hanke 2011).|$|E

5000|$|The Instructions of Shuruppak (or, Instructions of Šuruppak son of Ubara-tutu) are a {{significant}} example of Sumerian wisdom literature. Wisdom literature, intended to teach proper piety, inculcate virtue, and preserve community standards, was common throughout the ancient Near East. The text is set in great antiquity by its incipit: [...] "In those days, in those far remote times, in those nights, in those faraway nights, in those years, in those far remote years." [...] The precepts are placed {{in the mouth of}} a king Šuruppak (SU.KUR.RUki), son of Ubara-Tutu. Ubara-Tutu is recorded in most extant copies of the Sumerian king list as being the final king of Sumer prior to the deluge.

What was done took place as an in-class {{activity}} with almost no tasks performed out of class except for assignments. Thus, this descriptive case study aims to add one new dimension to the already existing methodology introducing a blog-integrated approach emphasizing individual-generated learning. Unlike its predecessors, the approach requires individuals to select texts, analyze targeted structural points in authentic texts, and produce similar structures through modelling, all performed on weblogs, with full participation and collaboration of learners embracing the notion of “self-directed” learning. Although the designed approach aims to teach and reinforce English grammar to English learners, it does not limit itself to this field.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to argue for the ongoing use of {{dialogue}} as a modern pedagogical and andragogical method. The author reviewed 18 scholarly sources from three education databases in this literature review. The use of dialogue as mode of <b>instruction</b> <b>dates</b> from the Socratic Method of 399 B. C. E. to present uses. The literature reveals current studies of successful use in math, ESL, business, law, and teacher preparation instruction. Also, the dialogue as avenue into reflective self-learning appears prominently in modern practice. Multimedia, computer, and online dialogue methods also show good results in several well designed models. The author concludes that dialogue in different forms remains an effective method of instruction in wide applications. The research revealed several improvements and new applications for dialogue as method of education from Socrates in ancient Greece to public elementary, secondary, and post-secondary institutions in 2009...|$|R

50|$|In 1553 {{he fought}} against {{supporters}} of Wyatt's rebellion in Kent, {{and he may}} have served in Ireland under his father during Mary's reign. About 1559 he was named a commissioner to transfer to England John Bale's manuscripts and books. In 1560 he was sheriff of Kent. He was soon a member of the Privy Council of Ireland, and in July 1565 he was knighted. Queen Elizabeth had decided to establish a presidential government in Munster, and in January 1566 St Leger was nominated President of Munster, but locally by Sir Henry Sidney, the Lord Deputy of Ireland; he received <b>instructions</b> <b>dated</b> 1 February, and in the following month was given command of all the levies in Munster. Elizabeth, however, refused to confirm St Leger's appointment. The reason was that St Leger was a bitter enemy of Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormond, and correspondingly friendly with Gerald Fitzgerald, 15th Earl of Desmond; and the queen accused St Leger of lukewarmness in arresting Desmond early in 1565. St Leger was consequently recalled, and in November 1568 Sir John Perrot became president of Munster.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was one of}} {{the commissioners}} in the inquiry instituted by Cromwell prior to the {{suppression}} of the monasteries but he did not obtain any share of the spoils. There is little doubt that his known friendship for More militated against his chances of success, for in a letter addressed to Cromwell he admitted his friendship for More, but protested that he rated higher his duty to the king. William Roper, in his Life of More, says that Elyot was on a second embassy to Charles V in the winter of 1535-1536 and received the news of More's execution while at Naples. He had been kept in the dark by his own government, but heard the news from the emperor, or so Roper says, writing years later, but R. W. Chambers writes that Roper had confused the timing of Elyot's ambassadorship, and of the emperor's remarks—about More's resignation, not his execution. [...] The story of an earlier embassy to Rome (1532), mentioned by Burnet, rests on a late endorsement of <b>instructions</b> <b>dated</b> from that year, which cannot be regarded as authoritative.|$|R

In her memoir, Lucy Duff-Gordon credited her corps of assistants for {{their contributions to the}} success of the New York branch of Lucile Ltd. Many of these assistants' drawings were published in the press and signed [...] "Lucile", [...] though occasionally the signature of the artist, such as Molyneux, appeared. It was general practice for couture houses to use professional artists to execute drawings of designs as they were being created, as well as of the artist's own ideas for each season's output and for individual clients.
