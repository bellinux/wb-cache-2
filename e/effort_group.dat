50|$|In Australia, the escaped airmen of the 30th Bombardment Squadron {{were joined}} by Americans who had arrived from the states in December and re-formed as an {{effective}} combat unit with some B-17Es that had arrived at Brisbane. Some of the most war-weary planes from Del Monte were sent south to Laverton in Victoria for major overhauls. However almost immediately upon arrival, on 29 December 11 B-17s of the squadron were sent to Singosari Airfield near Malang, Java, to continue combat operations. The 19th Bomb Group flew B-17Es, B-24Cs, and some Lend-lease LB-30s (B-24As) that were commandeered by the USAAC from a Royal Air Force order. The squadron operated from Singosari Field and participated in numerous attacks against Japanese targets in the Celebes, in Sumatra, and participated in raids against shipping during the Japanese invasion of Bali in the Netherlands East Indies. However, by late February, the position of Allied forces in Java had become untenable, and the squadron was evacuated on 2 March back to Australia when the Japanese defeated Allied ground forces in the Dutch East Indies.It must be remembered that in these early months of World War II, B-17 operations from Australia were not the smooth, well-practiced operations that would be seen later over Europe with the Eighth Air Force. Fifth Air Force operations were more of an improvised affair, and the numbers of B-17s that were lost in one-day missions in Europe than more than were operational any day in the entire Fifth Air Force. Maximum <b>effort</b> <b>Group</b> missions were lucky to involve six or ten aircraft at most. Crews lived in makeshift accommodations with swarms of insects, disease, poor food, and lack of spare parts. They battled furious tropical storms {{as much as the}} enemy and flew incredibly hazardous missions, often at night. Their planes were battle-worn and flew without fighter protection. Even when a few replacement aircraft dribbled in, the 21,000 mile journey from South Florida through the Caribbean then across the South Atlantic and through Africa and India to Australia meant the aircraft arrived in need of overhaul immediately upon their arrival.|$|E

Archival data were collected from 136 veterans classified into Poor Effort (n 42) and Good Effort (n 94) groups based on symptom validity test (SVT) performance.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{clinical}} utility of memory minus Working Memory Index (memory-WMI) discrepancy scores on the WMS-III for detecting poor effort in 145 personal injury litigants (19 poor effort, 126 adequate effort). On average, participants in the poor <b>effort</b> <b>group</b> performed significantly lower on all WMS-III memory indexes and demonstrated larger memory-WMI discrepancy scores compared to participants in the adequate <b>effort</b> <b>group.</b> Discriminant function analyses using memory-WMI discrepancy scores as independent variables revealed poor overall classification rates (60. 0 % to 63. 4 %). Based on the prevalence of unusually suppressed attention-concentration ability relative to memory functioning using unidirectional memory-WMI discrepancy scores, high specificity and negative predictive power values were found. However, there was unacceptably low sensitivity and positive predictive power. These results suggest that memory-WMI discrepancy scores on the WMS-III do not provide clinically useful information regarding response set and should be used cautiously as an indicator of poor effort...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to analyze and relate the leadership behaviors and communication styles required of Infantry junior officers in their daily command tasks, in order to influence their subordinates to achieve extraordinary <b>effort,</b> <b>group</b> effectiveness and satisfaction. For this study, was used quantitative method and a survey was implemented comprising three questionnaires: one on leadership competences, one on communication styles, and one on with three criterion factors (extraordinary <b>effort,</b> <b>group</b> effectiveness and satisfaction). The survey was administered to a sample of 804 soldiers (30 Junior Officers, 81 Sergeants and 693 privates and corporals). The analysis of the data revealed that subordinates perceive that their commanders (junior officers) practice task oriented leadership behaviors, particularly on “orientation to the mission” and “decision making”. The behaviors exhibited by the officers strongly and positively relate with the “assertive” communication style. Moreover, all leadership behaviors practiced by the officers are strongly associated to the criterion factors, {{with the exception of the}} leadership dimension “vision”, which presents weaker correlations. The leadership dimensions that junior officers can conduct to promote satisfaction is “conflict management” and “participative leadership”. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

40|$|Whether {{cleanliness}} influences {{moral judgments}} has recently become {{a topic of}} debate in the psychological literature. After the initial report that activating the notion of physical purity can result in less severe moral judgments (Schnall, Benton, & Harvey, 2008), a direct replication (Johnson, Cheung, & Donnellan, 2014 a) with much larger sample sizes failed to yield similar findings. The current paper examines the possibility that only nonconscious activation of the cleanliness concept, as achieved in participants with low response effort on priming materials, can produce the expected effect. An online replication (Study 1, N = 214) provided evidence that, when participants exerted low (yet still acceptable) levels of response effort to the experimental material, cleanliness priming led to more lenient moral judgments than neutral priming. An online experiment (Study 2, N = 440; replicated in Study 2 a, N = 436) manipulating participants’ effort on the priming task (low versus high) supported the hypothesized mechanism. Specifically, respondents in the low response <b>effort</b> <b>group</b> were instructed to complete the priming task {{as quickly as possible}} without too much attention, and the cleanliness priming resulted in less extreme moral judgments than the neutral condition as expected. In contrast, respondents in the high response <b>effort</b> <b>group</b> were instructed to perform {{to the best of their}} ability on the priming task, with a nonsignificant difference on moral ratings between cleanliness and neutral conditions. In addition to helping resolve the controversy regarding the cleanliness hypothesis, the current paper calls into attention the role of response effort in the execution and replication of priming studies...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: It is {{well known}} that {{eccentric}} training is a successful way of treating chronic tendinopathy. Although clinical results are very positive, beneficial morphological and histological effects have not yet been elucidated. The aim of our experiment was to determine if there exist any intrinsic modifications in a tendon trained in concentric or eccentric modes, in a rat model, using an original method of measurement (cryo-jaws). Methods: 18 rats were divided into 3 groups: 6 for the control group, without physical restraint; 12 for a training of 1 hour, 3 times a week, for 5 weeks, at a speed of 17 m/min (1 km/h), on a inclined treadmill: 6 rats running uphill at + 15 ° for the concentric <b>effort</b> (<b>group</b> C) and 6 rats running downhill at - 15 ° for the eccentric <b>effort</b> (<b>group</b> E). After this training period, the Achilles, patellar and tricipital tendons of both limbs were surgically removed in all 18 rats. Tendons taken from five rats of each group were subjected to a tensile test up to rupture using a “cryo” jaw. Tendons of the remaining rat of each group were subjected to a histological study. Results: The results showed significant changes in group E only: (1) an increase of the force required to rupture the patellar and tricipital tendons; (2) an improvement of the ratio between the force necessary to rupture the tricipital tendon and the body mass of the rats; (3) an increase of the surface area of the section of the tricipital tendon. No significant change was observed as far as constraint was concerned between groups. Histologically, we saw, in the group E, more peripheral blood vessels and a greater proportion of collagen. Conclusion: This study showed that the mechanical properties of tendon tissue are enhanced by eccentric training. Tendons become stronger, the amount of collagen increases and there is probably more interaction between collagen fibers (mechanotransduction). Peer reviewe...|$|E
