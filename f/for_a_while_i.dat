5|$|I {{must confess}} that, like many others, I {{did not come}} painlessly to the Natural History. For years I was {{put off by the}} aura of {{sanctity}} and bluffness which seemed to surround it. It was the kind of book presented on prize-giving days, and I saw it as a work, in all senses, of the old school. Even when I eventually came to read it, I cannot say my opinion changed dramatically. I could not cope at first with its rambling disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>I</b> failed to notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.|$|E
500|$|I went to {{the theatre}} [...] and there I saw Claracilla (the first time I ever saw it), well acted. But strange to see this house, that use to be so thronged, now empty since the opera begun—and so will {{continue}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> believe.|$|E
500|$|Screenwriter John August {{identified}} with Will's character and adapted it after himself. In college, August's father died, and like Will, August {{had attempted to}} get to know him before his death, but found it difficult. Like Will, August had studied journalism and was 28 years old. In the film, Will says of Edward, [...] "I didn't see anything of myself in my father, and I don't think he saw anything of himself in me. We were like strangers who knew each other very well." [...] Will's description of his relationship with Edward closely resembled August's own relationship with his father. Burton also used the film to confront his thoughts and emotions concerning {{the death of his father}} in 2000: [...] "My father had been ill <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while...</b> <b>I</b> tried to get in touch with him, to have, like in this film, some sort of resolution, but it was impossible." ...|$|E

500|$|During his 1966 tour, Dylan was {{described}} as exhausted and acting [...] "as if on a death trip". D. A. Pennebaker, the film maker accompanying the tour, described Dylan as [...] "taking a lot of amphetamine and who-knows-what-else." [...] In a 1969 interview with Jann Wenner, Dylan said, [...] "I {{was on the road}} for almost five years. It wore me down. I was on drugs, a lot of things... just to keep going, you know?" [...] In 2011, BBC Radio 4 reported that, in an interview that Robert Shelton taped in 1966, Dylan said he had kicked heroin in New York City: [...] "I got very, very strung out <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while...</b> <b>I</b> had about a $25-a-day habit and I kicked it." [...] Some journalists questioned the validity of this confession, pointing out that Dylan had [...] "been telling journalists wild lies about his past since the earliest days of his career." ...|$|E
500|$|Kyle Busch {{appeared}} in Victory Lane {{to celebrate his}} first victory of the season; the win earned him $198,550. He said, [...] "I don't {{know how many times}} I spun out and didn't spin out. Amazing race. It was fun to drive when I wasn't getting turned around", and, [...] "Stab and steer, stab and steer, That's what you do. And some brakes. There are brakes involved, too. I thought I was clear... and I tried going down slowly, and Jimmie just must have been there a little bit, turned me sideways and got me on the apron—scared everybody half to death, including me." [...] Stewart, who finished second, said, [...] "I actually had fun racing at Daytona again, which I haven't had <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> <b>I</b> don't know what the consensus is from everybody else, but I had more fun as a driver tonight than what we've had in the past." [...] Ambrose, who finished third in the race, explained, [...] "It's definitely a lot more fun, more entertaining for the fans, and more in control for the drivers." ...|$|E
500|$|MacGregor {{said that}} he had come to London to attend King George IV's {{coronation}} on the Poyers' behalf, and to seek investment and immigrants for Poyais. He claimed to have inherited a democratic system of government there, with a basic civil service and military. To those interested MacGregor showed what he said was a copy of a printed proclamation he had issued to the Poyers on 13 April 1821. He therein announced the 1820 land grant, his departure for Europe to seek investors and colonists—"religious and moral instructors... and persons to guide and assist you"—and the appointment of Brigadier-General George Woodbine to be [...] "Vice-Cazique" [...] during his absence. [...] "POYERS!", the document concluded, [...] "I now bid you farewell <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while...</b> <b>I</b> trust, that through the kindness of Almighty Providence, I shall be again enabled to return amongst you, and that then it will be my pleasing duty to hail you as affectionate friends, and yours to receive me as your faithful Cazique and Father." [...] There is no evidence that such a statement was ever actually distributed on the Mosquito Coast.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{days after}} Donald Trump's inauguration, Bannon told an American newspaper, “The media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> <b>I</b> {{want you to}} quote this: the media here is the {{opposition}} party. They don't understand this country. They still do not understand why Donald Trump {{is the president of}} the United States.” ...|$|E
2500|$|On the {{evolution}} of technique in his illustration, Grossman has said, [...] "I {{was impressed by the}} way David Levine and the Push Pin artists were using line to develop a bulgy three-dimensional feeling in their work. I found an old airbrush in my dad's shop and discovered a jiffy way to outbulge them all. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> diligently pursued outline-less-ness as the secret to a real stereoscopic three-dimensional look. I felt my line work belonged to a different world {{that had nothing to do}} with the airbrush and went its separate way. Lately I find a strong line reasserting itself in my pictures." ...|$|E
2500|$|Galima Bukharbaeva, a {{journalist}} for IWPR, witnessed a [...] "mass of dead and wounded. At first, {{one group of}} armoured-personnel carriers approached the [...] square, and then another group appeared. They opened fire without mercy on everyone indiscriminately, including women and children. The crowd began to run in all directions. We dove into a ditch and lay there <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> <b>I</b> saw at least five bloody corpses next to me. The rebels who are holding the provincial administration opened fire in response. They intend to stand to the end! When {{we got out of}} the ditch, we ran along the streets into the neighbourhood and now we're looking for a place where there's no shooting. But shots can be heard everywhere..." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 638, Ma {{was made}} a mid-level {{official}} at the legislative bureau (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng). Ma was praised for his alertness and logical thinking, and Emperor Taizong once stated, [...] "If I did not see Ma Zhou <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>I</b> would always miss him." [...] The chancellor Cen Wenben also stated, [...] "When Mr. Ma analyzes matters, he took examples from both history and current events. He deletes what is not necessary, and then analyzes thoroughly. Nothing should be added and nothing should {{be taken away from}} what he writes. His words are well-written, and one will not get tired of them." [...] In 641, Ma was given three different posts—assistant auditor, imperial advisor, and secretary to Emperor Taizong's son, Li Zhi (the Prince of Jin). After Li Zhi replaced his elder brother, Li Chengqian, as crown prince, Ma {{was made a}}n advisor to the new crown prince as well as deputy head of the legislative bureau.|$|E
2500|$|Liu Ye, {{a friend}} of Lu Su, once {{wrote a letter to}} him: [...] "Now, warlords and heroes have emerged all over the Empire. I believe {{the time has come for}} me to put my talents to good use. I am in a rush to fetch my mother but I will be {{dropping}} by Dongcheng County <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> <b>I</b> heard that recently, someone called Zheng Bao (鄭寶) has rallied thousands of followers in Chaohu and the lands under their control are very fertile. Many people in Lujiang Commandery are planning to join him after hearing about him – not to mention myself. I observe his situation and see that he is still gathering followers. You should act fast and not miss this opportunity." [...] Lu Su agreed with what Liu Ye said. After his grandmother's funeral, Lu Su returned to Qu'e County and made plans to leave Jiangdong and head north to join Zheng Bao. However, he found out that Zhou Yu had fetched his mother to Wu Commandery (吳郡; around present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu) so he went to Wu Commandery to speak to Zhou Yu.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2011, Bassingthwaighte {{returned}} to theatre, performing at the Sydney Opera House, in Love, Loss and What I Wore, a play [...] "about women, their relationships and memories", where she co-starred with Judi Farr, Mirrah Foulkes, Amanda Muggleton and Magda Szubanski. On 28 August 2011, Bassingthwaighte told The Daily Telegraph {{that she had}} recorded several new tracks, with her single [...] "All We Have" [...] expected to be released soon. She said, [...] "Everything is coming together…I did lose my mojo <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>I</b> just didn't believe in doing something unless you're totally up for it. I wasn't feeling creative and then, suddenly, it was Christmas and it just felt right". [...] "All We Have" [...] was released in September 2011 and it failed to chart. In February 2012, Bassingthwaighte was announced as a Moomba Monarch alongside Harry Kewell, the Australian socceroo. In December 2014, Bassingthwaighte and other Australian singers recorded a cover version of Kate Bush's [...] "This Woman's Work" [...] under the name [...] "Hope for Isla and Jude", and released it as a charity single to help raise funds for two siblings who suffer from the rare disease Sanfilippo syndrome. In September 2015, Bassingthwaighte reunited with her former band Rogue Traders, performing {{together for the first}} time in seven years, at a corporate show in Gold Coast. They later reunited again in December for a New Year's Eve show, where they hinted at the possibility of future shows, and confirmed that Bassingthwaighte's former replacement Mindi Jackson had given the band's reunion her blessing.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's all right," [...] Dr. Whiles declared, [...] "so long as it's understood. You'll {{excuse me}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment <b>while</b> <b>I</b> write <b>a</b> note, and I'll come along." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Really? You know, Major, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while</b> <b>I</b> {{suspected}} you. Because you wouldn't let me kill him. I {{thought you}} might be protecting him." [...] She laughed.|$|R
60|$|At this, {{they were}} not displeased. But to tell the plain truth, I harbored some shadowy purpose of merely {{hovering}} about <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> till <b>I</b> felt more landwardly inclined.|$|R
2500|$|In 2005, The Kolkata Telegraph {{reported}} that director Rituparno Ghosh wanted to cast Chakraverti {{in a film}} based on a case the Wiccan had encountered while practicing the craft. Ghosh commented, [...] "Till now, I have dealt with relationships and {{the intricacies of the}} human mind. With this film, I want to delve into that which lies beyond and observe how this non-conventional spiritualism, Wicca, guides me. [...] It's a story of two time zones, separated by a span of 150 years, two people of different mindsets and different cultures." [...] However, in 2006, the story Sacred Evil from Sacred Evil: Encounters with the Unknown was adapted into a film by Sahara One Motion Pictures; Ipsita served as creative director. The film, titled as Sacred Evil– A True Story, was a joint venture between Sahara One and Percept Picture Company. Sacred Evil was the last story in the book and is about a nun who was hounded by her troubled past and for whom the convent eventually sought counseling from Chakraverti. Sahara One had approached August 2004 to make a film on Sacred Evil, but she was reluctant to play herself on the big screen when offered the role, and chose, instead to be the creative director. Chakraverti helped pen the script, incorporating a large amount of dialogue from her story. [...] "I told the production team how the protagonist reacted in certain situations, since I had lived the story, and how the dialogue happened. [...] I also insisted that the film be shot in Calcutta, though others had suggested other places, because it's here where I have done most of my therapies." [...] Actress Sarika was signed to play Chakraverti's part, to which Chakraverti said: [...] "The other and more important task was familiarizing Sarika with the ways of a Wiccan. We had several sittings before going for the shoot. Sarika wanted to imbibe me. So, she came down to Delhi and lived with me <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> <b>I</b> showed her how the healing took place and how certain rituals had been conducted." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> did {{not seem}} to believe it; this {{obviously}} imminent event stunned me when it came, as though I had never had an anticipatory moment. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> went on working, and then almost apathetically, in a mood of half-reluctant curiosity, I started for Lowchester.|$|E
60|$|Subsequently she {{obtained}} {{a place as}} a cook at Howick, and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> saw her no more.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> waited <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while.</b> <b>I</b> {{sighed and}} leant {{back in my}} chair. [...] "It is {{perfectly}} simple," [...] I smiled, [...] "now that we have cool heads." ...|$|R

6000|$|At that he grew {{sober and}} his eyes glinted. [...] "You can't take a little fun. I'll leave you now <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> When <b>I</b> come back you'll have that suit on!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You won't {{be wanting}} me <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>I</b> guess?' said Stuyvesant nonchalantly. 'Think I'll smoke a {{cigarette}} on the porch.' ...|$|E
60|$|He. Ugh! Don't! Well, now I'm up, {{you must}} {{dispense}} with the fascinating Congleton <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> <b>I</b> don't like him.|$|E
60|$|He sat {{staring out}} of the window, and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>I</b> did not care to intrude upon his evidently painful memories.|$|E
6000|$|... "Only <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little <b>while.</b> <b>I</b> don't {{count on}} sellin' papers all my life. You see, I 'low {{to make money}} enough so's I can go inter somethin' reg'lar for myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For one thing, I've put {{up most of}} the new timbers {{and guess}} she'll hold <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> Then <b>I</b> sure don't like that Metis kid. Reckon I'll kill him if I stop." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, dear, it {{is still}} dark. Sleep again <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> and <b>I</b> will sleep too. I think Grace will be here to-night, and {{then there will be}} no room for me here." ...|$|R
