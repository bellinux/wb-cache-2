40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{investigate}} how the manufacturing process, the shop type and the data quality, i. e. the shop floor characteristics, influence the use of advanced planning and scheduling (APS) systems in production activity and control (PAC). The methodology implemented is a multiple case study at three case companies. Each company has different shop floor characteristics, but all use a scheduling module in an APS system, which supports production scheduling. A theoretical framework is developed suggesting how APS system are used in the PAC activities, and which major aspect to consider. The case analysis shows that the scheduling module in APS system, foremost supports sequencing and dispatching. In particular, the shop type is influenced by the decision of how often the APS runs and what freedom is given to the shop floor. The manufacturing process influences how the <b>dispatch</b> <b>list</b> is created. Contrary to the literature presuming that APS systems are most suitable in job shop processes, it is found that the manufacturing process is not a crucial factor when deciding whether APS systems are an appropriate investment. It is found that the level of data quality needed in the APS system depends to a large extent on how the <b>dispatch</b> <b>list</b> is used. For example, is the <b>dispatch</b> <b>list</b> used as a guideline, not a regulation, the need for accurate data in the module is reduced. This article extends the previous literature concerning APS systems by analysing how APS systems influence PAC as a whole and increase the understanding of the challenges of using APS systems in PAC...|$|E
40|$|Current {{trends in}} Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) suggest that supply chain {{management}} and tight control over scheduling jobs within the supply chain are key tactical planning issues. Modern ERP software packages, {{in conjunction with the}} World Wide Web, allow for automated exchange of information within a company and also between two or more companies (i. e., conveyance of customer information to suppliers) of parts and components) for the purposes of effective planning and control. While ease of information exchange between a customer and supplier is increasingly {{critical to the success of}} modern-day planning and control efforts, the issue of information security is also a very real concern. Suppliers can benefit from gaining access to a customer's <b>dispatch</b> <b>list</b> and material requirements plan (MRP) in order to determine real-time priority of jobs in queue at various work centers within their own organization. Other customer information, however, should remain secure and unavailable to supplier firms for competitive reasons such as threat of forward integration. This paper presents a previously tested priority-sequencing rule that explicitly considers downstream shop conditions in determining which job to run next The rule proves to perform well on mean flow time and lateness as well as on variability of these measures. The rule is extended here to incorporate the case where a downstream work center is outside official corporate boundaries. With the call for free exchange of information comes the threat of other, perhaps proprietary, information being accessed by vendors or others outside the official corporate boundaries. The paper will propose information that should be freely exchanged between customers and suppliers and information that should remain secure. Finally, practical measures to manage access to web-enabled ERP information will be proposed...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the impact of high-quality information on performance in manufacturing. In a system where two material flows with sequence dependency are matched, the use of real-time information to monitor and control the sequencing buffer improves the system's ability to schedule many different models, compared with a system with no information at all. In the latter case, the system is upset considerably when more than four different models enter the system. The use of automatic data capture systems enhances productivity in manufacturing companies. Six case studies were carried out, all of which showed that the productivity improvements obtained by these systems are mainly in the area of human resource utilisation which was found in all six case studies. Improvements in machine utilisation, transporter utilisation and inventory levels were also found. The productivity can furthermore be improved if the installed system acts as a proactive system, giving information on the operational level about deviations and changed customer demands. Out of 31 registered disturbances, 15 resulted in a productivity loss because scheduling information was not available. A system providing scheduling information makes it possible for the scheduler to change a <b>dispatch</b> <b>list</b> or final assembly schedule {{in such a way that}} a less important job can be run ahead of a delayed important job, only to release capacity when the delayed job arrives. These kinds of systems mainly enhance productivity in an environment with shared resources. The impact of providing the scheduler with real-time information of high quality is investigated. It is shown that this enables him to reschedule the work force when stochastic events such as disturbances of different kinds affect the scheduling environment. It is also shown that the performance of the scheduled system improves a/ in direct relation to the number of work stations being scheduled and b/ with the reduction in lapse between the detection of a deviation and corrective action. Measures taken to prevent the propagation of disturbances can be classified as formal measures and informal actions. Formal measures are such measures which are defined in a computer system, and informal actions are such that are executed manually. None of the measures identified in this study were efficient when a holistic evaluation was made. This evaluation describes the ability of the measure to absorb disturbance effects, its cost and the degree to which it upsets the system. Some measures were, however, better than others. Partial delivery is a suitable action when materials shortages occur, subcontracting when machines break down, and moving over personnel when absenteeism occurs. When an ADCS is used, two types of effect can be experienced; direct effects and indirect effects. The direct effects are the result of the data capture process as such being enhanced, i. e. less effort is needed to capture data and to trace and correct faulty data, and the indirect effects are the effects experienced when timely and accurate data is fed into the data base from which a number of functions retrieve the data. The direct effects are normally easy to define. They affect the number of staff involved in data capture and handling, and in some cases safety stock levels. Indirect effects are more difficult to isolate. A general model showing the manufacturing process and the different ADCSs which can be found within each activity was developed. Indirect effects experienced as a result of enhanced decision-making when an ADCS is installed were; increased sales, decreased costs and decreased inventory investments. Both direct and indirect effects enhance the effectiveness of a company. It is shown how the use of a serial information flow respectively a parallel information flow with different time delays affects the performance of a system when expediting is carried out. The results indicate that a parallel information flow, i. e. information to the succeeding activities being given in advance, performs best if the information quality is high, i. e. the time delay is close to zero. When the time delay increases there is a threshold when the serial information flow performs better than the parallel information flow with poor information quality. The performance of the parallel system decreases with poor information quality. The same result is obtained with respect to the output, i. e. the output decreases with poor information quality...|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of an optional market premium in the {{revision of the}} German Renewable Energies Act (EEG) gives renewable energy sources(RES) the possibility to participate in control reserve markets. Though the reform of the EEG has set the legislative framework for the integration of wind farms into the existing market structures, {{which led to the}} successful integration in power exchange markets, wind farms have not yet participated in control reserve markets in Germany due to unfavorable market conditions and unresolved problems with the market regulations. The following study is assessing the economic impact of wind turbines participating in control reserve markets under different parameters. The assessment determines the maximum cost saving potential of wind turbines participating in secondary and tertiary control reserve markets. Results show that under current market conditions cost saving potentials can be achieved within the given scenarios. This will lead to decreasing balancing costs. In the first part (chapter 4 & 5) of the study it is explained how the offers from wind farms can be calculated. In order to bid on control reserve markets the wind park operator has to calculate an offer, which is based on a defined security level for the forecast. Therefore the operator will use probabilistic forecasts to calculate the offerable amount of control reserve. In the second part (chapter 6) these offers are entered into existing control reserve <b>dispatch</b> <b>lists.</b> The economic impact is evaluated as the difference between two scenarios. One that will serve as the reference scenario without wind turbine participation and one that includes the bids from wind farms. By this means different parameters are examined. This includes the variation of the security level, changes in the block length of control reserve products, bidding for positive and negative products and differences in the mechanism to proof the provision of energy from controlreserves for intermittent producers. Results show that cost saving potentials can reach up to 21 % in tertiary control reserve market and up to 24 % on secondary control reserve market...|$|R
50|$|Although {{internal}} implementations may vary, delegate instances can {{be thought}} of as a tuple of an object and a method pointer and a reference (possibly null) to another delegate. Hence a reference to one delegate is possibly a reference to multiple delegates. When the first delegate has finished, if its chain reference is not null, the next will be invoked, and so on until the list is complete. This pattern allows an event to have overhead scaling easily from that of a single reference up to <b>dispatch</b> to a <b>list</b> of delegates, and is widely used in the CLI.|$|R

Beginning with the copyright reform of 1909, newspapers could obtain blanket copyrights that covered most of their contents, but this logic did not apply to the much more fluid textual universe of the nineteenth century. The timing of the first copyright claims, {{and the extent to which}} these claims were respected, depended upon evolving attitudes toward the genre and subject matter of the texts in question. Serial novels were treated differently than poems, biographical sketches, or political essays, not to mention telegraphic <b>dispatches</b> or price <b>lists.</b> In the absence of clear legislation, editors of periodicals policed each other, arguing over what could be copied and how such copied material should be acknowledged or given “credit. ” As they complained about or encouraged copying, authors and publishers debated the shifting boundaries of what Meredith McGill has called the “culture of reprinting. ” Changes in the copyright statute only came later, after individuals had experimented with existing laws and tried to create new norms for the republication of texts...|$|R
