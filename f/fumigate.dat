5|$|Poisonous {{bromomethane}} {{was widely}} used as pesticide to <b>fumigate</b> soil and to <b>fumigate</b> housing, by the tenting method. Ethylene bromide was similarly used. These volatile organobromine compounds are all now regulated as ozone depletion agents. The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer scheduled the phase {{out for the}} ozone depleting chemical by 2005, and organobromide pesticides are no longer used (in housing fumigation they {{have been replaced by}} such compounds as sulfuryl fluoride, which contain neither the chlorine or bromine organics which harm ozone). Before the Montreal protocol in 1991 (for example) an estimated 35,000 tonnes of the chemical were used to control nematodes, fungi, weeds and other soil-borne diseases.|$|E

The storm's precipitation flooded nearby agricultural fields, stopping wheat production, forcing local government to <b>fumigate</b> {{the region to}} try to prevent a dengue fever outbreak. In the Yaqui River valley, two people were killed, and another 70homes were destroyed by Henriette's winds. Throughout the state, 24,000families were left homeless.|$|E

40|$|<b>Fumigated</b> {{wood was}} assumed to retain {{durability}} level against wood destroying factors. Due to lack of data, <b>fumigated</b> wood durability against wood destroying factors needs to be investigated, especially toward subterranean termites. The aim {{of this research was}} to evaluate <b>fumigated</b> wood durability against subterranean termites attack in laboratory scale (ASTM D 3345 - 2008). Wood samples used were sengon (Falcataria moluccana), rubberwood (Hevea brasiliensis), and mangium (Acacia mangium). Samples of 2. 5 × 2. 5 × 0. 6 cm were <b>fumigated</b> inside 2 × 1 × 1 m of fumigation chamber using 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 liters of ammonia solution for 4 days. The samples were then transferred into glass bottle, along with sterile sand and 200 worker and 20 soldier subterranean termites. After 4 weeks, mortality and weight loss percentage were measured. All treatments showed 100 % of mortality, while a significant decline in weight loss percentage was varied depends on wood species as well as the volume of ammonia. Therefore, <b>fumigated</b> wood was proven resistant against the attacks of subterranean termites...|$|R
40|$|Phosphine {{fumigation}} {{is commonly}} used to disinfest grain of insect pests. In fumigations which allow insect survival {{the question of whether}} sublethal exposure to phosphine affects reproduction is important for predicting population recovery and the spread of resistance. Two laboratory experiments addressed this question using strongly phosphine resistant lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.). Offspring production was examined in individual females which had been allowed to mate before being <b>fumigated</b> for 48 h at 0. 25 mg L - 1. Surviving females produced offspring but at a reduced rate during a two-week period post fumigation compared to unfumigated controls. Cumulative fecundity of <b>fumigated</b> females from 4 weeks of oviposition post fumigation was 25 % lower than the cumulative fecundity of unfumigated females. Mating potential post fumigation was examined when virgin adults (either or both sexes) were <b>fumigated</b> individually (48 h at 0. 25 mg L - 1) and the survivors were allowed to mate and reproduce in wheat. All mating combinations produced offspring but production in the first week post fumigation was significantly suppressed compared to the unfumigated controls. Offspring suppression was greatest when both sexes were exposed to phosphine followed by the pairing of <b>fumigated</b> females with unfumigated males and the least suppression was observed when males only were <b>fumigated.</b> Cumulative fecundity from 4 weeks oviposition post fumigation of <b>fumigated</b> females paired with <b>fumigated</b> males was 17 % lower than the fecundity of unfumigated adult pairings. Both of these experiments confirmed that sublethal exposure to phosphine can reduce fecundity in R. dominica...|$|R

There have been other {{accidents}} as well; for example, in 2010 according to The Star, crewmen from the freighter Hermann Schoening were sickened by phosphine gas which had been used to <b>fumigate</b> or control pests; rescuers took them by tugboat to receive medical attention.|$|E
25|$|When news of {{the plague}} in Poland arrived in the Kingdom of Prussia, then still neutral in the war, {{precautions}} were taken to prevent it spreading across the border. From 1704, health certificates were compulsory for travellers from Poland. From 1707, a broad cordon sanitaire extended around {{the border of the}} former Duchy of Prussia, and those crossing into the Prussian exclave were quarantined. Yet the border was long and wooded, and not all roads could be guarded; thus bridges were demolished, lesser roads blocked, and orders were given to hang people avoiding the guarded crossings and burn or <b>fumigate</b> all incoming goods. There were, however, many exemptions for people with cross-border estates or occupations, who were allowed to pass freely.|$|E
25|$|On the building's dome, {{there are}} stained glass panels, these panels were all taken down, {{inspected}} and cleaned. These panels had deteriorated {{due to its}} age {{and the effects of}} gravity on the lead works. Each panel had to be transported in a special mould and sent to a stained glass restorer who used 18th century reinforcement techniques to restore the lead and glass works; the process took four months to complete. Modern staircases have been installed in the building to contrast the old and new. A spiral staircase which leads to the roof of the old museum building was restored. The windows and doors were conserved and the original type and size of timber and 18th century carpentry techniques were used to restore the timber windows and doors. Some of the original timber works used huge timber sections made of kapur wood. These sections required about four months to source, supply, <b>fumigate,</b> treat, cut and deliver to the site.|$|E

500|$|Until its {{discovery}} and importation from the New World, tobacco was unknown to western medicine. [...] Europeans were not {{ignorant of the}} effects of smoke; incense has been used since antiquity, and the psychoactive effects of burning hemp seed was well known by the Scythians and Thracians. [...] The ancient Greek physician Hippocrates recommended the inhalation of smoke for [...] "female diseases" [...] as did Pliny the Elder, as a cure for coughs. [...] The Native Americans from whom the first western explorers learnt about tobacco used the leaf for a variety of purposes, including religious worship, but Europeans soon became aware that the Americans also used tobacco for medicinal purposes. [...] The French diplomat Jean Nicot used a tobacco poultice as an analgesic, and Nicolás Monardes advocated tobacco as a treatment for a long list of diseases, such as cancer, headaches, respiratory problems, stomach cramps, gout, intestinal worms and female diseases. [...] Contemporaneous medical science placed much weight on humorism, and for a short period tobacco became a panacea. [...] Its use was mentioned in pharmacopoeia as a tool against cold and somnolence brought on by particular medical afflictions, its effectiveness explained by its ability to soak up moisture, to warm parts of the body, and to therefore maintain the equilibrium so important to a healthy person. [...] In an attempt to discourage disease tobacco was also used to <b>fumigate</b> buildings.|$|E

2500|$|A second cholera {{pandemic}} reached Russia (see Cholera Riots), Hungary (about 100,000 deaths) and Germany in 1831; {{it killed}} 130,000 people in Egypt that year. [...] In 1832 it reached London and the United Kingdom (where more than 55,000 people died) and Paris. In London, the disease claimed 6,536 victims {{and came to}} be known as [...] "King Cholera"; in Paris, 20,000 died (of a population of 650,000), and total deaths in France amounted to 100,000. The epidemic reached Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia and New York in the same year, and the Pacific coast of North America by 1834. In the center of the country, it spread through the cities linked by the rivers and steamboat traffic. Cholera afflicted Mexico's populations in 1833 and 1850, prompting officials to quarantine some populations and <b>fumigate</b> buildings, particularly in major urban centers, but nonetheless the epidemics were disastrous.|$|E
2500|$|Janet Parker was {{the last}} person to die from smallpox. [...] The {{diagnosis}} was made by Professor A.

[...] Before the diagnosis had been confirmed, a member of Flewett’s laboratory had [...] collected fluid from Janet Parker’s vesicles and taken it across the grounds of the hospital for examination in the virus laboratory. Flewett recognised the danger of an outbreak occurring and immediately ordered his staff to <b>fumigate</b> the laboratory with formaldehyde. [...] The ward in which Janet Parker had been initially cared for was also fumigated. The building housing wards 31 and 32 were later demolished. Two members of Flewett’s team were subsequently quarantined but apart from Janet Parker’s mother, no further cases of smallpox occurred. This tragedy led to the suicide of Professor Henry Bedson a friend and colleague of Flewett.|$|E
