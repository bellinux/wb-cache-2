The numbers and microanatomical localization of cells of the major lymphocyte and monocyte subsets were measured histometrically in immunocytochemically-stained sections of biopsies of the 48 h reactions. Despite the close similarity in size of the external appearance of the reactions provoked by the two preparations, 'New tuberculin' elicited a more extensive perivascular infiltrate and more numerous diffusely infiltrating M 3 -bearing cells: the number of diffusely infiltrating CD 4 and CD 8 lymphocytes was similar in reactions against the two antigen preparations. Thus the method used to prepare a skin test reagent may affect the nature of the cellular reaction it provokes: differences in content of various classes of antigenic macromolecules are probably important, but the relative content of other <b>irritant</b> <b>constituents</b> may also be important...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{changes in}} {{regulatory}} requirements and social views on animal testing have incremented {{the development of}} reliable alternative tests for predicting skin and ocular irritation potential of products based on new raw materials. In this regard, botanical ingredients used in cosmetic products are among those materials, and should be carefully reviewed concerning the potential presence of <b>irritant</b> <b>constituents.</b> In particular, cosmetic products used on the face, in vicinity of the eyes or that may {{come in contact with}} mucous membranes, should avoid botanical ingredients that contain, or are suspected to contain, such ingredients. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of a new cosmetic ingredient, namely, coffee silverskin (CS), with an in vitro skin and ocular irritation assay using reconstructed human epidermis, EpiSkin™, and human corneal epithelial model, SkinEthics™ HCE, and an in vivo assay. Three different extracts of CS were evaluated. The histology of the models after extracts applications was analysed. The in vitro results demonstrated that extracts were not classified as irritant and the histological analyses proved that extracts did not affect both models structure. The content of caffeine, 5 -hydroxymethyl furfural and chlorogenic acid was quantified after the epidermal assay. The in vivo test carried out with the most promising extract (hydroalcoholic) showed that, with respect to irritant effects, these extracts can be regarded as safe for topical application...|$|E
