40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out under {{greenhouse}} conditions on lettuce cv. Ilanka. Seeds were sown in January 1982 and 1984. Lettuce was cultivated to middle of June up to full flowering time. It {{was found that the}} preparation <b>fenoprop</b> (2, 4, 5 -trichlorofenoxypropionic acid as a dimethylamine salt) in concentrations of 10, 20 and 50 mg·dm - 3 significantly decreased latex tipburn symptoms. <b>Fenoprop</b> increased the healthiness of the plants because treated plants were also less attacked by grey mould Botritis sp. <b>Fenoprop</b> also inhibited head formation in lettuce, but the weight of these plants was never smaller than control ones. Sometimes the weight of plants treated with <b>fenoprop</b> was significantly higher than of the control plants. Lettuce plants without heads had bolted earlier. Only the concentration of 100 mg·dm - 3 of <b>fenoprop</b> retarded plant growth. The effect of K-NAA (potassium salt of α-naphthaleneacetic acid) on lettuce was weaker than the effect of <b>fenoprop.</b> After K-NAA treatment at a concentration of 25 mg·dm - 3, lettuce plants formed normal heads but latex tipburn symptoms were retarded...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the removal of trace organic contaminants by a combined membrane bioreactor - granular activated carbon (MBR-GAC) system {{over a period of}} 196 days. Of the 22 compounds investigated here, all six hydrophilic compounds with electron-withdrawing functional groups (i. e., metronidazole, carbamazepine, ketoprofen, naproxen, <b>fenoprop</b> and diclofenac) exhibited very low removal efficiency by MBR-only treatment. GAC post-treatment initially complemented MBR treatment very well; however, a compound-specific gradual deterioration of the removal of the above-mentioned problematic compounds was noted. While a 20 % breakthrough of all four negatively charged compounds namely ketoprofen, naproxen, <b>fenoprop</b> and diclofenac occurred within 1000 - 3000 bed volumes (BV), the same level of breakthrough of the two neutral compounds metronidazole and carbamazepine did not occur until 11, 000 BV. Single-solute isotherm parameters did not demonstrate any discernible correlation individually with any of the parameters that may govern adsorption onto GAC, such as log D, number of hydrogen-bond donor/acceptor groups, dipole moment or aromaticity ratio of the compounds. The isotherm data, however, could differentiate the breakthrough behaviour between negatively charged and neutral trace organic contaminants. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|The removal {{efficiency}} of 22 selected trace organic contaminants by sequential application of {{granular activated carbon}} (GAC) and simultaneous application of powdered activated carbon (PAC) with membrane bioreactor (MBR) was compared in this study. Both sequential application of GAC following MBR treatment (MBR–GAC) and simultaneous application of PAC within MBR (PAC–MBR) achieved improved removal (over 95 %) of seven hydrophilic and biologically persistent compounds, which were less efficiently removed by MBR-only treatment (negligible to 70 %). However, gradual breakthrough of these compounds occurred over an extended operation period. Charged compounds, particularly, <b>fenoprop</b> and diclofenac, demonstrated the fastest breakthrough (complete and 50 – 70 %, in MBR–GAC and PAC–MBR, respectively). Based on a simple comparison from the long-term performance stability and activated carbon usage points of view, PAC–MBR {{appears to be a}} better option than MBR–GAC treatment...|$|E
40|$|The {{removal of}} trace organics by a {{membrane}} bioreactor–granular activated carbon (MBR–GAC) integrated system were investigated. The results confirmed that MBR treatment {{can be effective}} {{for the removal of}} hydrophobic (logD 3 ̆e 3. 2) and readily biodegradable trace organics. The data also highlighted the limitation of MBR in removing hydrophilic and persistent compounds (e. g. carbamazepine, diclofenac, and <b>fenoprop)</b> and that GAC could complement MBR very well as a post-treatment process. The MBR– GAC system showed high removal of all selected trace organics including those that are hydrophilic and persistent to biological degradation at up to 406 bed volumes (BV). However, over an extended period, breakthrough of diclofenac was observed after 7320 BV. This suggests that strict monitoring should be applied over the lifetime of the GAC column to detect the breakthrough of hydrophilic and persistent compounds which have low removal by MBR treatment...|$|E
40|$|This study {{compared}} the removal efficiency of 22 widespread trace organic contaminants by a laboratory-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) {{with and without}} direct addition of powdered activated carbon (PAC) into the activated sludge reactor {{over a period of}} 312 days. The removal of hydrophilic and biologically persistent trace organic contaminants was immediately improved to above 95 % after the addition of PAC into MBR. However, a compound-specific gradual decrease in removal underscored the requirement for the addition of fresh PAC. Adsorption onto PAC-added sludge appeared to {{play a significant role in}} the relatively more effective aqueous phase removal of a few resistant compounds such as carbamazepine in this study. A slower reduction in removal efficiency of compounds showing extraordinary persistence such as <b>fenoprop</b> and diclofenac was observed after raising the PAC concentration in the MBR from 0. 1 to 0. 5. g/L. Nevertheless, comparison of extent of removal in terms of PAC usage indicated the suitability of more frequent dosing of smaller amounts of PAC. 2013 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} to examine the pesticide residues in some soil samples collected from irrigated agricultural farmlands around Mysore city, Karnataka, India. These samples were analyzed by gas chromatog. consisting of electron capture detector (ECD) to analyze the organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and flame photometric detector (FPD) for anal. of organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs). OCPs consist of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), endosulfan, DDT and its metabolite DDE which were detected in all the soil samples, and their total concn. range from > 64. 27 Î¼g/g to 4504. 18 Î¼g/g. Among all the pesticides, endosulfan had the highest concn., followed by HCH with an order of endosulfan > HCH > DDE > DDT. The regional concn. of residues was as follows: east > west > south > north. DDT residues were absent in {{western part of the}} city and the concn. of other pesticides except endosulfan was quite low. DDT concns. indicate no new input or very low new applications of this pesticide in these soils, while the high concn. of endosulfan may show new input of pesticides like dimethoate, malathion, parathion, monocrotophos, <b>fenoprop</b> etc. in these farmlands. No detectable organophosphorus pesticides were found in the soil samples. The main source of contamination was related to human activities, such as agricultural chem. applications.

40|$|A {{pilot plant}} {{study has been}} {{conducted}} to investigate the behaviour of organic micropollutants during slow sand filtration. The main goal {{of the study was}} to obtain information on the removal of some substituted benzenes, pesticides, synthetic complexing agents and AOX under the characteristic conditions of slow sand filtration practice. From the studied organic micropollutants a substantial removal of the following compounds has been found: - Substituted benzenes: p-dichlorobenzene (ca. 80 % decrease), o-dichlorobenzene 70 %, nitrobenzene (70 - 80 %) and p-chloronitrobenzene (60 - 80 %). - Pesticides: 2, 4 -D (r. b. d.), MCPA (r. b. d.), Mecoprop (r. b. d), <b>Fenoprop</b> (60 %) en TCA (50 %). - Complexing agents: NTA (75 - 85 %). No or only a slight decrease in concentrations has been observed for the following compounds: - Substituted benzenes: m-dichlorobenzene (20 - 40 %), o-chloronitrobenzene (40 %), 2, 4 -dichloroaniline (20 - 40 %). - Pesticides: Atrazine (0 %), Bentazon (0 %). - Complexing agents: EDTA (0 %). - AOX (10 %). The study revealed that slow sand filtration is an effective drinking water treatment process for the removal of a number or organic micropollutants. A high removal of organic micropollutants can be expected especially in combination with anaerobic artificial recharge of river water in dunes, and in combination with activated carbon filtration, which could be less effective for the removal of high polar organic compounds. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of trace organics such as pesticides, pharmaceutically active compounds, natural and synthetic hormones {{as well as}} various industrial compounds in the aquatic environment is of great concern due to their potential adverse effects on human health {{and those of other}} biota. Therefore, the removal of these compounds from wastewater is an important consideration to ensure safe drinking water and better protect the environment. In the literature, several techniques have been explored for trace organics removal, namely, conventional activated sludge (CAS), membrane bioreactors (MBRs), nanofiltration/reverse osmosis membrane filtration (NF/RO) and adsorption; however a universal end-of-pipe treatment process is yet to be established. Evidence from the literature indicates that neither MBR nor activated carbon on its own can adequately remove all trace organics of concern. This thesis investigates sequential and simultaneous application of activated carbon adsorption with MBR treatment for an enhanced removal of trace organic contaminants. A set of 22 compounds representing four major groups of trace organics including 11 pharmaceutical and personal care products, 2 pesticides, 4 industrial chemicals and their metabolites and 5 steroid hormones was selected for this investigation. Various investigations were conducted during the continuous operation of a laboratory-scale MBR system for a total of 306 days. This thesis focuses on 93 days of operation of a combined MBR with granular activated carbon (MBR - GAC system) followed by 100 days of operation of the MBR after direct addition of powdered activated carbon (PAC) into it. The MBR showed stable and high performance with respect to all key basic water quality parameters (e. g., TOC, TN and turbidity) and operating parameters (e. g., pH, and MLVSS/MLSS ratio). It was confirmed that MBR treatment can effectively remove hydrophobic (i. e., compounds having a distribution coefficient, Log D 3 ̆e 3. 2) and readily biodegradable trace organic compounds. The reported data also highlighted the limitation of MBR in removing hydrophilic and persistent compounds such as metronidazole, ketoprofen, carbamazepine, diclofenac, and <b>fenoprop.</b> GAC post-treatment was observed to complement MBR treatment to obtain initially high overall removal of less hydrophobic and biologically persistent trace organic GAC post-treatment was observed to complement MBR treatment to obtain initially high overall removal of less hydrophobic and biologically persistent trace organic The removal of the 22 selected trace organic contaminants by MBR treatment was enhanced after direct addition of PAC into it.
