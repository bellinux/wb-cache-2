5|$|At a New Year's Eve {{party that}} year, Sally feels alone without Harry by her side. Harry spends New Year's alone, {{walking around the}} city. As Sally decides to leave the party early, Harry appears and {{declares}} his love for her. She argues {{that the only reason}} he is there <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> is lonely, but he lists the many things he realized he loves about her. They kiss and marry three months later.|$|E
5|$|Kate {{is upset}} about Sawyer not wanting {{her to come}} back to the beach with him to rescue Sayid, Jin and Bernard. Jack tells her it is because Sawyer was trying to protect her. When she asks why Jack is {{defending}} Sawyer, Jack informs Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) that it <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> loves her. Kate also witnessed a kiss between him and Juliet. Ben and Alex intercept Jack's group; Ben informs Jack that Naomi is not who she says she is, and making contact with her boat will be disastrous for everyone. Ben orders the shooting of Sayid, Jin, and Bernard, and when Jack hears three shots, he attacks Ben and punches him in the face repeatedly. Unknown to Jack, the shots were fired into the sand, following earlier orders from Ben. Rousseau meets her sixteen-year-old daughter Alex, who was kidnapped by the Others shortly after her birth, and they tie Ben up. The trek party, now able to get a signal, arrives at the radio tower. Rousseau disables her distress signal, freeing the frequency for Naomi. However, Naomi is knifed in the back by Locke, who threatens to kill Jack if he calls Naomi's boat. Locke cannot bring himself to kill Jack, who communicates with George Minkowski (Fisher Stevens) on Naomi's boat. Minkowski tells the survivors they will be sending rescue.|$|E
50|$|The {{narration}} {{implies that}} Zebedee's {{reason for not}} joining with Doogal and the others on their quest <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> went to search for Zeebad; in the original, it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had to stay behind to guard the roundabout.|$|R
50|$|He was nicknamed Bizz (or Biz) by his siblings. His sister Diana {{has claimed}} that it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> always so busy with working on something, but his brother Bret {{said in his}} {{autobiography}} that it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> always up to some mischievous business.|$|R
60|$|It {{may have}} <b>been</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> just then {{cut off from}} all his fellow-creatures and even from the world itself; it may have <b>been</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> satiated with marvels and with the almost {{absolute}} control over the powers which the Demon had conferred upon him; or it may have <b>been</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born and reared a hearty, healthy American boy, with a disposition to battle openly with the world and take his chances equally with his fellows, rather than be placed in such an exclusive position {{that no one could}} hope successfully to oppose him.|$|R
5|$|Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) {{plans to}} go to his first sales call with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson). Dwight surprises Ryan by taking him to Dwight's beet farm to both teach and haze. When Ryan, a member of a {{fraternity}} in college, accuses him of trying to haze him into acceptance, Dwight snaps at him, saying the reason Ryan has yet to make a sale <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> thinks he knows everything, and must think otherwise to sell. After Dwight tries to force Ryan to wrestle his cousin Mose (Michael Schur), Ryan gets angry and walks out. Dwight apologizes to Ryan and begins to give Ryan serious sales advice as Ryan takes notes. The two then go on a sales call which ultimately doesn't work out for Ryan. Irritated, Ryan throws eggs at the building housing the company that refused his sale. Dwight and Ryan then go to a bar and return to the office, where it appears they formed a new bond.|$|E
25|$|The {{speaker is}} proclaiming {{that he will}} no longer {{acknowledge}} the young lover in public. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> wants to avoid bringing further shame on {{the object of the}} poem via guilt by association, contrary to the reference cited.|$|E
25|$|Glyceranus asks Mystes why he {{is being}} quiet. Mystes {{explains}} that it <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> is worried. Mystes explains {{that the source of}} his worries is over-abundance (satias). Glyceranus invites Mystes to tell him more, under the shade of an elm tree.|$|E

25|$|Chomsky {{believes}} that acts he considers terrorism {{carried out by}} the US government do not pass this test, and condemnation of United States foreign policy {{is one of the main}} thrusts of his writings which he has explained <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> lives in the United States, and thus holds a responsibility for his country's actions.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after {{learning}} {{the news of}} Kazangap's death, Yedigei observes a rocket launching from the launch site north of the Boranly-Burranyi junction. Launches, though infrequent, are not unusual to Yedigei, but this one in particular <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had no prior knowledge of it. Generally, such occasions heralded pompous celebration, but this one had not.|$|E
25|$|The Villa Savoye {{uses the}} {{horizontal}} ribbon windows {{found in his}} earlier villas. Unlike his contemporaries, Corbusier often chose to use timber windows rather than metal ones. It {{has been suggested that}} this <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was interested in glass for its planar properties and that the set-back position of the glass in the timber frame allowed the façade {{to be seen as a}} series of parallel planes.|$|E

25|$|The writing {{style of}} the lyrics is {{deliberately}} obscure; Oakey says this <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> wanted the band's lyrics to provoke thought and get people talking about their songs. Often the meanings behind the songs have only been disclosed by Oakey in various interviews given since the album's release. An {{important point is that}} the album essentially evolved during 1981 and wasn't written from a single conceptual starting point.|$|E
25|$|Doro's {{character}} {{plays an}} important role in the novel because he has total control over all of the other characters. Part of the reason that Doro has so much control <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> determines whether one lives or dies. Doro has the gift and curse of being able to take on the body of anyone he desires. This is a gift because he is immortal, but it is a curse because when a body gets old, it is mandatory that he changes bodies in order to live. In order for Doro to survive, he must kill. This causes the other characters to be very wary of how they behave around Doro because they know that their life can be over at any moment. Another reason that Doro has so much control <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> is a man. The fact that he is a man makes it much easier for him to control other women, especially Anyanwu. Anyanwu is physically strong enough to fight Doro, but there are times where she does not retaliate against his physical abuse. Doro uses sex to draw women close to him and to create an emotional bond that makes it hard for them to leave.|$|E
25|$|Besides Perfect One (Kamil), Most Perfect One (Akmal), and Perfect Master (Mukammil), Meher Baba {{described}} {{one other}} type of incarnate soul that has transcended the finite ego and merged {{in a state of}} God-consciousness, but cannot help others. This type is the Majzoob (Arabic: Absorbed). Unlike the Perfect Master, {{or any of the other}} sub-types of God-realized souls, the Majzoob is absorbed in God to such a degree that he cannot be of any direct assistance to anyone else in creation though he can be of indirect help to those who honor him. This <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> is a perfect mast and as such has no experience of the external physical or internal mental worlds. According to Meher Baba the Majzoob has no experience of the gross, subtle, or mental worlds, but is entirely absorbed in the bliss of his state of Godhood.|$|E

25|$|They set out, {{and attempt}} to cross Caradhras, but a {{snowstorm}} causes an avalanche, closing the pass. They reluctantly decide the only way past the Misty Mountains is to go under them, via the dwarven mines of Moria. In Moria, they fight off orcs as they pass through the chambers. Near the exit, they are attacked by a Balrog. Gandalf stands against it, defeating it by destroying the bridge on which it is standing. However, as it falls, it catches Gandalf with its whip, pulling him down after it. The distraught party leave Moria, entering Lothlórien, and meeting Galadriel (Jennifer Hale). She takes Frodo to see the Mirror of Galadriel, where he sees images of the coming War of the Ring. Frodo offers her the One Ring and although she is tempted, she turns it down, explaining that his resistance to its evil <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> has never tried {{to use it to}} control others.|$|E
25|$|Suda's {{style of}} writing and {{direction}} {{has been compared to}} the works of Quentin Tarantino. A defining part of Suda's original work has been its balance of humor, dark or mature themes, violence and sexuality. His focus on death <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> feels it needs a rationale behind it, and so he focuses on those closely tied with death such as assassins. In his action titles, he considered the reasons behind each character's wish to fight and the reason for their deaths. His portrayal of death in his games was influenced by his time as an undertaker. Sexuality, while a big part of many of Suda's works, is not an important element from his perspective, and when used he is attempting to express a core part of the overall story and theme. Another recurring theme in his work from The Silver Case onwards is the focus on the criminal elements in society, in addition to people with equally valid views coming into conflict with each other. Following the serious tone of The Silver Case, Flower, Sun, and Rain saw a stylistic shift to a more light and casual tone. This approach of switching styles for each successive original project would be repeated by Suda throughout his career: when talking about the contrast between Lollipop Chainsaw and Killer is Dead he described is as a yin-yang effect.|$|E
500|$|The author {{explained}} to Los Angeles Magazine her reasoning for {{including in the}} book a graphic phrase used by Jack Nicholson after his lovemaking session with her: [...] "The reason that line made the book <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> {{told me not to}} say anything.

500|$|With a {{satisfying}} protagonist completed, Sega turned to esteemed programmer Yuji Naka, who had impressed them through {{his work on}} Phantasy Star and the Genesis port of Ghouls 'n Ghosts. Naka was a fan of Super Mario Bros. but desired something faster, so the game was made to play quickly, which was where he focused most of his effort. Naka explained that the reason he wanted a fast game <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> ported Ghouls 'n Ghosts, and wanted to work on its movement but found it slow.|$|E
500|$|Doggett, Reyes, and Harrison {{camp out}} at the Conlon's house and soon stumble upon the monsters that Tommy sees: large, insect-like creatures that {{multiply}} when shot by bullets. The local sheriff (Steve Ryan) arrives, alerted by Scully, but a scuffle ensues. The sheriff draws a gun, and Doggett punches him, only to have his hand go completely through the man's stomach. Upon investigation, Reyes is unable to find any organs in the man's body. Tommy soon shows Reyes the pictures he has been drawing. They include the sheriff with a gun, insect creatures, and Reyes with an insect creature bursting through her stomach. [...] Reyes asks Tommy why he would imagine such things, and Tommy replies it <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> is very scared.|$|E
500|$|Teammate Aaron Mauger, {{along with}} many New Zealand fans, have {{suggested}} that McCaw's influence and playing style {{has made him a}} target for illegitimate play. International players Phil Waugh, Jamie Heaslip, Marcus Horan, Lote Tuqiri, Andy Powell, Dylan Hartley, Quade Cooper, Dean Greyling, Kevin McLaughlin and Scott Higginbotham have been accused of making [...] "cheap shots" [...] on McCaw. He has even been on the receiving end from his All Black teammates when playing for the Crusaders, with Neemia Tialata, Jerry Collins and Ali Williams becoming frustrated with his play. According to McCaw [...] "what happens on the field stays on the field" [...] and if he gets extra attention it <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>he</b> [...] "must be doing something right".|$|E
