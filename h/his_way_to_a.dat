On <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> cousin's wedding rehearsal, he suffered a bicycle accident in which he fell into gravel, permanently scarring his face.

Nevinson was billeted with other visitors in the Ch√¢teau d'Harcourt, south of Caen. Although life at the Chateau allowed Nevinson to demonstrate his cocktail making skills to the other visitors, he soon transferred to the 4th Infantry Division near Arras. From there he moved widely along the Front, visiting forward observation posts and artillery batteries. He flew with the Royal Flying Corps and came under anti-aircraft fire. He spent a night in an observation balloon above the Somme. Making <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> forward post one day he was pinned down by enemy fire for an hour. An unauthorised visit to the Ypres Salient earned Nevinson a reprimand and added to his reputation for recklessness.|$|E
