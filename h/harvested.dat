40|$|Abstract When {{growth is}} density dependent, partial <b>harvest</b> of the {{standing}} stock of cultured species (fish or shrimp) {{over the course}} of the growing season (i. e., partial <b>harvesting)</b> would decrease competition and thereby increase individual growth rates and total yield. Existing studies in optimal <b>harvest</b> management of aquaculture operations, however, have not provided a rigorous framework for determining "discrete" partial <b>harvesting</b> (i. e., partially <b>harvest</b> the cultured species at several discrete points until the final <b>harvest).</b> In this paper, we develop a partial <b>harvesting</b> model that is capable of addressing discrete partial <b>harvesting</b> and other partial <b>harvesting</b> using impulsive control theory. We derive necessary conditions of the efficient partial <b>harvesting</b> scheme for a single production cycle. We also present a numerical example to illustrate how partial <b>harvesting</b> can improve the profitability of an aquaculture enterprise compared to single-batch <b>harvesting</b> and gradual thinning. The study results indicate that well-designed partial <b>harvesting</b> schemes can enhance the profitability of aquaculture operations.

40|$|This {{study was}} focused on the {{economic}} impact of corn residue <b>harvest</b> systems on typical grain <b>harvesting.</b> In Chapter 2, the single-pass stover <b>harvest</b> system with several equipment application logistics is examined; in Chapter 3, both existing and potential single-pass cob <b>harvest</b> systems were evaluated with respect to <b>harvest</b> work time length, equipment and labor requirements, <b>harvest</b> cost, and post-harvest costs related to residue collection. Residue collection actually increased <b>harvest</b> time due to the lower <b>harvest</b> rate caused by additional material passing through the combine. Field traffic increased as additional equipment is required during harvesting; an increased labor requirement was also an important result in all <b>harvest</b> scenarios. In the stover single-pass <b>harvest</b> scenario, increasing on-board stover density helped to significantly reduce equipment and labor requirements.

40|$|Abstract Human <b>harvesting</b> {{is often}} a major {{mortality}} factor and, hence, an important proximate factor driving the population dynamics of large mammals. Several selective <b>harvesting</b> regimes focus on removing animals with low reproductive value, such as “antlered ” <b>harvests</b> in North America and juvenile <b>harvesting</b> in many European countries. Despite its widespread use and assumed impact, the scientific basis of juvenile <b>harvesting</b> is scattered in the literature and not empirically well-documented. We give the first overview of demographic, evolutionary and practical management arguments for selective <b>harvesting</b> of juve-niles. Furthermore, we empirically test two demographic arguments based on <b>harvest</b> statistics of Red Deer (Cervus elaphus) in seven European countries. P 1 : <b>Harvesting</b> juveniles has little influence on <b>harvest</b> growth compared with <b>harvesting</b> adult females due to the lower reproductive value of juveniles than adult females; P 2 : <b>Harvesting</b> of juveniles dampens variance in <b>harvest</b> due to lower and more variable natural survival rates of juveniles compared with adults. We found that <b>harvesting</b> juveniles has little effect on <b>harvest</b> growth rate, while <b>harvesting</b> adult females has a significant negative effect (consistent with P 1), but that increasing the proportion of juveniles in the <b>harvest</b> did not decrease the variability in <b>harvest</b> between years (P 2 not supported). Based on our empirical findings and overview of arguments, we discuss how the merits of juvenile <b>harvesting</b> may vary over time as populations move from a low density to a very high density state...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{sought to}} compare the 6 -month {{angiographic}} patency rates of greater saphenous veins removed during coronary artery bypass grafting with the endoscopic vein <b>harvest</b> or open vein <b>harvest</b> techniques. MethodsTwo hundred patients undergoing nonemergency on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting were prospectively randomized to either endoscopic vein <b>harvest</b> or open vein <b>harvest.</b> Follow-up angiography of all vein grafts was scheduled at 6 months. Graft patency and disease grades were assigned independently by 2 interventional cardiologists. Leg wound healing was evaluated at discharge, 1 month, and 6 months for evidence of complications. ResultsThere were 3 conversions from endoscopic vein <b>harvest</b> to open vein <b>harvest</b> because of vein factors. Leg wound complications were significantly lower in the endoscopic vein <b>harvest</b> group (7. 4 % vs 19. 4 %, P =. 014). On multivariable analysis, endoscopic vein <b>harvest</b> emerged as the only factor affecting wound complications (odds ratio, 0. 33). Three deaths (2 perioperative and 1 late) occurred in the endoscopic vein <b>harvest</b> group that were unrelated to vein graft closure. Twenty-four and 29 patients in the endoscopic vein <b>harvest</b> and open vein <b>harvest</b> cohorts, respectively, refused the follow-up 6 -month angiography. Therefore a total of 144 angiograms (73 endoscopic vein <b>harvests</b> and 71 open vein <b>harvests)</b> and 336 vein grafts (166 endoscopic vein <b>harvests</b> and 170 open vein <b>harvests)</b> were available for analysis. The overall occlusion rates at 6 months were 21. 7 % for endoscopic vein <b>harvest</b> and 17. 6 % for open vein <b>harvest.</b> Additionally, there was evidence of significant disease (> 50 % stenosis) in 10. 2 % and 12. 4 % of endoscopic vein <b>harvest</b> and open vein <b>harvest</b> grafts, respectively. By means of ordinal hierarchic logistic regression, endoscopic vein <b>harvest</b> was {{not found to be}} a risk factor for vein graft occlusion or disease (odds ratio, 1. 15). Significant predictors were congestive heart failure (odds ratio, 2. 87), graft to the diagonal artery territory (odds ratio, 1. 76), larger vein conduit size (odds ratio, 1. 32), and graft flow (odds ratio, 0. 90). ConclusionEndoscopic vein <b>harvest</b> reduces leg wound complications compared with open vein <b>harvest</b> without compromising the 6 -month patency rate. The overall patency rate depends on target and vein-related variables and patient characteristics rather than the method of vein <b>harvesting...</b>|$|R

Competition had slowly been growing, however, in the form of artificially produced plant ice and mechanically chilled facilities. Unreliable and expensive at first, plant ice began to successfully compete with natural ice in Australia and India during the 1850s and 1870s respectively, until, by the outbreak of World War I in 1914, more plant ice was being produced in the U.S. each year than naturally <b>harvested</b> ice.
