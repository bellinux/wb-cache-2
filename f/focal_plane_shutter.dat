2500|$|The {{outline design}} of the F24 camera {{was carried out by}} the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, and it was {{introduced}} in 1925. Detailed design, and most production, was by Williamson Manufacturing Company Ltd of Willesden Green, London NW.10. The F24 was designed to be lighter and smaller than the F8 camera of 1919, but the F8 continued to be used in less demanding installations. The main component units of the F24 are a body with roller blind <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> <b>shutter,</b> gearbox, film magazine, and lens cone. Image film format is 5"×5", on 5" [...] wide roll film, with magazine capacity up to 250 exposures (the F8 offered images up to 8"×7.5" [...] on 9" [...] wide film). Shutter speed is preset between 1/100s and 1/1000s.|$|E

5000|$|Despite {{the common}} {{appellation}} of Speed Graphic, various Graphic models were produced between 1912 and 1973. The authentic Speed Graphic has a <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> <b>shutter</b> that the Crown Graphic and Century Graphic models lack.

50|$|The major {{improvements}} in the FM2 compared to the FM were silicon photodiode light meter sensors, limited automatic dedicated electronic flash control and, most famously, a mechanically-timed vertical metal shutter (bearing mounted for reduced friction and extended life) reaching {{a top speed of}} an unprecedented 1/4000th second, with an X-sync of 1/200. This shutter was able to reach such ultra-fast speeds because its titanium honeycomb curtains had a travel time of 3.3 milliseconds, half of typical vertical travel metal-bladed <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> <b>shutters</b> of the time.|$|R
50|$|Due {{to their}} construction, <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> <b>shutters,</b> as used on most SLRs, only allow normal xenon flash units {{to be used}} at shutter speeds slow enough that the entire shutter is open at once, {{typically}} at shutter speeds of 1/60 or slower, although some modern cameras may have an X-sync speed as high as 1/500 (e.g. Nikon's D40 DSLRs). Special electronic flash units for focal-plane shutters fire several times as the slit moves across the film. Electronic shutters used in some digital cameras do not have this limitation and may allow a very high X-sync speed.|$|R

50|$|Alternatively, if {{the amount}} of flash light cannot be altered easily (for example with studio flashes), it is also {{possible}} to alter the aperture instead, however, this will also affect the depth of field and ambient light exposure. If the flash to ambient light ratio is to be changed in flash bracketing using this technique, it is necessary to counter-shift the shutter speed as well {{in order to maintain the}} level of ambient light exposure, however, with <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> <b>shutters,</b> this is often difficult to achieve given their limited X-sync speed - and flash techniques such as high-speed synchronization are not available with studio flashes.|$|R
5000|$|Because the Speed Graphic had its {{historical}} origins as the quintessential press camera [...] {{prior to the}} advent of 35mm and digital photography for use by press photographers, some still consider {{the use of a}} Graphlex obsolete. However, both the Speed Graphic and the Graflex SLR have <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> <b>shutters</b> that allow use of large un-shuttered barrel lenses. These cameras are now being used by fine art photographers to make images that excel in depth of field control and image detail. As an example, a Kodak Aero Ektar 178 mm f/2.5 lens can be fitted to Speed Graphic 4x5 cameras and used to take soft/sharp photographs with complete control of the depth of focus.|$|R
5000|$|The {{designation}} 'V-system' was {{not used}} until {{the launch of the}} H-system. The name [...] "V System" [...] was not created until the development of the [...] "H System"; with a new system premiering, Hasselblad needed a designation to differentiate the older product line.The Hasselblad V-System evolved out of Victor Hasselblad's desire to develop a small camera with fast lenses and shutters, that was as easily hand-holdable as a Leica, but with a larger film format. The Rolleiflex's 6×6 format was deemed ideal: large enough to provide high image quality, but small enough to fit inside a compact camera. The Rolleiflex's leaf shutter lacked the fast <b>shutter</b> speeds <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> <b>shutters</b> could provide, and neither Leica rangefinder nor Rolleiflex TLR provided the(TTL) through the (taking) lens viewing that the slow to use, big Graflex SLR provided.These considerations led to the 1600 F and a flexible camera system that includes interchangeable bodies, lenses, viewfinders, winders, film magazines and holders, and other accessories. Problems with the <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> <b>shutters</b> in the 1600 F and 1000 F cameras and especially the increasing importance of electronic flash {{led to the development of}} the manual leaf shutter-based medium-format 6×6 (6×6 cm or 2¼×2¼ inches) 500 C SLR camera in 1957 which offered flash synchronization at all shutter speeds. The 500 C was joined by the motor-driven 500 EL SLR camera in 1964. These two cameras, together with the Superwide Camera (SWC) which was introduced in 1954 as a wide angle camera using the Carl Zeiss Biogon 38 mm f/4.5 lens and built-in levels for exacting architecture photography, formed the core of the V-system and shared most accessories (with a few exceptions).|$|R
50|$|The Crown Graphic {{models of}} this same period {{were similar in}} overall design to the Speed Graphics, but omitted their <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> <b>shutter,</b> {{allowing}} Crown Graphic models to be about one inch (2.5 cm) smaller and 1 pound lighter (.5 kg) Furthermore, their lack of a <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> <b>shutter</b> allowed lenses to be mounted closer to the film plane, enabling the use of wider angle lenses on these models.|$|E

5000|$|The Phase One 645DF+ and 645DF {{cameras are}} medium format cameras which support both <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> and leaf <b>shutter</b> lenses with shutter speeds ranging from 1/4000s to 60 minutes and flash {{synchronization}} up to 1/1600 sec.

5000|$|Other {{focal-plane shutter}} designs, {{such as the}} Copal Square, {{travelled}} vertically — the shorter travelling distance of 24 millimetres (as opposed to 36 mm horizontally) meant that minimum exposure and flash synchronisation times could be reduced. These shutters are usually manufactured from metal, and use the same moving-slit principle as horizontally travelling shutters. They differ, though, in usually being formed of several slats or blades, rather than single curtains as with horizontal designs, as there is rarely enough room {{above and below the}} frame for a one-piece shutter. Vertical shutters became very common in the 1980s (though Konica, Mamiya, and Copal first pioneered their use in the 1950s and 1960s, and are almost exclusively used for new cameras. Nikon used Copal-made vertical <b>plane</b> <b>shutters</b> in their Nikomat/Nikkormat -range, enabling x-sync speeds from [...] to [...] while the only choice for <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> <b>shutters</b> at that time was [...] Later, Nikon again pioneered the use of titanium for vertical shutters, using a special honeycomb pattern on the blades to reduce their weight and achieve world-record speeds in 1982 of [...] second for non-sync shooting, and [...] with x-sync. Nowadays most such shutters are manufactured from cheaper aluminium (though some high-end cameras use materials such as carbon-fibre and Kevlar).|$|R
50|$|Almost all {{contemporary}} SLRs use a {{focal-plane shutter}} located {{in front of}} the film plane, which prevents the light from reaching the film even if the lens is removed, except when the shutter is actually released during the exposure. There are various designs for <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> <b>shutters.</b> Early focal-plane shutters designed from the 1930s onwards usually consisted of two curtains that travelled horizontally across the film gate: an opening shutter curtain followed by a closing shutter curtain. During fast shutter speeds, the focal-plane shutter would form a 'slit' whereby the second shutter curtain was closely following the first opening shutter curtain to produce a narrow, vertical opening, with the shutter slit moving horizontally. The slit would get narrower as shutter speeds were increased. Initially these shutters were made from a cloth material (which was in later years often rubberised), but some manufacturers used other materials instead. Nippon Kōgaku (now Nikon Corporation), for example, used titanium foil shutters for several of their flagship SLR cameras, including the Nikon F, F2, and F3.|$|R
