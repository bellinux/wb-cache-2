40|$|Abstract—Broadcasting is an {{information}} dissemination {{problem in a}} connected network, in which one node, called <b>the</b> <b>originator,</b> disseminates a message to all other nodes by placing a series of calls along the communication lines of <b>the</b> network. Once <b>informed,</b> <b>the</b> nodes aid <b>the</b> <b>originator</b> in distributing <b>the</b> message. Finding the minimum broadcast time of a vertex in an arbitrary graph is NP-complete. The problem is solved polynomially only for trees, unicyclic graphs, and tree of cycles. In this paper we will consider broadcasting in a new class called the Fully Connected Trees (FCT). We will present a O(n logn) algorithm to find the broadcast time of any originator in an arbitrary FCT. I...|$|R
30|$|If route {{discovery}} is initiated by {{either of the}} gateways, all gateways broadcast RREQ with same RREQ ID because destination node is unknown. The destination node responds to first arriving RREQ as per AODV, and RREQ corresponds to the path between node and closest gateway. The closest gateway notifies <b>the</b> <b>originator</b> gateway {{if it is not}} <b>the</b> <b>originator</b> of RREQ packet itself. RREP <b>informs</b> gateway about <b>the</b> cost of RREP.|$|R

50|$|The memento {{pattern is}} {{implemented}} with three objects: <b>the</b> <b>originator,</b> a caretaker and a memento. <b>The</b> <b>originator</b> is some object {{that has an}} internal state. The caretaker {{is going to do}} something to <b>the</b> <b>originator,</b> but {{wants to be able to}} undo the change. The caretaker first asks <b>the</b> <b>originator</b> for a memento object. Then it does whatever operation (or sequence of operations) it was going to do. To roll back to the state before the operations, it returns the memento object to <b>the</b> <b>originator.</b> <b>The</b> memento object itself is an opaque object (one which the caretaker cannot, or should not, change). When using this pattern, care should be taken if <b>the</b> <b>originator</b> may change other objects or resources - the memento pattern operates on a single object.|$|R
5000|$|A {{heartbeat}} message in signal processing {{is a message}} sent from an originator to a destination that enables the destination to identify if and when <b>the</b> <b>originator</b> fails or is no longer available. [...] Heartbeat messages are typically sent non-stop on a periodic or recurring basis from <b>the</b> <b>originator's</b> start-up until <b>the</b> <b>originator's</b> shutdown. When <b>the</b> destination identifies a lack of {{heartbeat message}}s during an anticipated arrival period, the destination may determine that <b>the</b> <b>originator</b> has failed, shutdown, or is generally no longer available. Heartbeat messages {{may be used for}} high-availability and fault tolerance purposes.|$|R

50|$|Using {{asymmetric}} key cryptography, <b>the</b> <b>originator</b> obtains a public key from the directory node {{to send an}} encrypted message to the first ("entry") node, establishing a connection and a shared secret ("session key"). Using the established encrypted link to the entry node, <b>the</b> <b>originator</b> can then relay a message through the first node to a second node in the chain using encryption that only the second node, and not the first, can decrypt. When the second node receives the message, it establishes a connection with the first node. While this extends the encrypted link from <b>the</b> <b>originator,</b> <b>the</b> second node cannot determine whether the first node is <b>the</b> <b>originator</b> or just another node in <b>the</b> circuit. <b>The</b> <b>originator</b> can then send a message through {{the first and second}} nodes to a third node, encrypted such that only the third node is able to decrypt it. The third, as with the second, becomes linked to <b>the</b> <b>originator</b> but connects only with the second. This process can be repeated to build larger and larger chains, but is typically limited to preserve performance.|$|R
50|$|For example, {{with respect}} to <b>the</b> <b>originators</b> of {{subprime}} loans, many may have suspected that the borrowers {{would not be able}} to maintain their payments in the long run and that, for this reason, the loans were not going to be worth much. Still, because there were many buyers of these loans (or of pools of these loans) willing to take on that risk, <b>the</b> <b>originators</b> did not concern themselves with the potential long-term consequences of making these loans. After selling <b>the</b> loans, <b>the</b> <b>originators</b> bore none of the risk so there was little to no incentive for <b>the</b> <b>originators</b> to investigate <b>the</b> long-term value of the loans.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the power of}} different contractual mechanisms to influence an originator’s choice of costly effort to screen borrowers when <b>the</b> <b>originator</b> plans to securitise its loans. The analysis focuses on three potential mechanisms: <b>the</b> <b>originator</b> holds a “vertical slice”, or share of <b>the</b> portfolio; <b>the</b> <b>originator</b> holds <b>the</b> equity tranche of a structured finance transaction; <b>the</b> <b>originator</b> holds <b>the</b> mezzanine tranche, rather than the equity tranche. These mechanisms will result in differing levels of screening, and the differences arise from varying sensitivities to a systematic risk factor. Equity tranche retention {{is not always the}} most effective mechanism, and the equity tranche can be dominated by either a vertical slice or a mezzanine tranche if the probability of a downturn is likely and if the equity tranche is likely to be depleted in a downturn. If the choice of how much and what form to retain is left up to <b>the</b> <b>originator,</b> <b>the</b> retention mechanism may lead to low screening effort, suggesting a potential rationale for government intervention. retention requirements, screening incentives, securitisation, tranching...|$|R

30|$|DSR {{protocol}} is a {{routing protocol}} for MANET where no infrastructure is required. The multihop nature in DSR enables nodes to forward packets to neighboring nodes when the nodes {{are within the}} transmission range. <b>The</b> <b>originator</b> (sender) of <b>the</b> data initiates route discovery whenever {{the location of the}} destined receiver is not known. The route discovery packet, i.e., route request (RREQ), is flooded. Upon reaching every node, each node can read the packet information such as sender address, destination address, and request ID determined by <b>the</b> <b>originator.</b> Further, each node appends its identity when forwarding RREQ to the next nodes. Once the information has reached the target node, it sends a route replay message to <b>the</b> <b>originator.</b> Further, <b>the</b> entire route recorded in the RREQ packet is copied to route reply (RREP) and forwarded back to <b>the</b> <b>originator.</b> <b>The</b> <b>originator</b> upon receiving this information caches the route for subsequent routing. The intermediate nodes discard any packet when the packet contains the same ID that it has seen before or it finds its address in the recorded route; otherwise, it appends its address to route record in the RREQ packet [24, 25].|$|R
