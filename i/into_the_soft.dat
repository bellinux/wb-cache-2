5|$|The {{processes}} of feeding and capture may be aided by special parts; Pisaster brevispinus, the short-spined pisaster from the West Coast of America, {{can use a}} set of specialized tube feet to dig itself deep <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> substrate to extract prey (usually clams). Grasping the shellfish, the starfish slowly pries open the prey's shell by wearing out its adductor muscle, and then inserts its everted stomach into the crack to digest the soft tissues. The gap between the valves need only be {{a fraction of a}} millimetre wide for the stomach to gain entry.|$|E
5|$|In the north, they {{hibernate}} {{during the}} winter. Niell (1947, 1948) made observations in Georgia, and noted {{they were one}} of the last species to seek shelter, often being found active until the first heavy frosts. At this point, they moved to higher ground and could be found in rotting pine stumps by tearing away the bark. These snakes could be quite active upon discovery and would then attempt to burrow more deeply <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> wood or escape to the nearest water. In southeastern Virginia, Wood (1954) reported seeing migratory behavior in late October and early November. During a period of three or four days, as many as 50 individuals could be seen swimming across Back Bay from the bayside swamps of the barrier islands to the mainland. He suggested this might {{have something to do with}} hibernating habits. In the southern parts of its range, hibernation may be short or omitted altogether.|$|E
5|$|The {{interiors}} of most Norfolk churches contain much pre-Reformation graffiti, {{unless they have}} been heavily limewashed or resurfaced. The churches of the Glaven ports in general, and Blakeney in particular, conform to this pattern. St Nicholas has an extensive array of prayers, merchant's marks and other symbols, but is notable for {{the large number of}} depictions of ships, at least 30, heavily concentrated in the nave towards the eastern end of the south aisle. There is a side altar there of unknown dedication, and an empty niche that would have once held the image of a saint. The pillars were painted red in the Middle Ages, and ship images scratched <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>soft,</b> chalky stone would have been much more conspicuous than they are now. It is likely that the images, mostly of smaller ships, were created as votive offerings by the seafaring inhabitants of the port. The carving of ship graffiti in religious buildings is a tradition in ports going back to the Bronze Age, and has been found across Europe.|$|E

25|$|The fuses in {{the shells}} {{proved to be}} unreliable, {{with the result that}} many of the shells {{exploded}} prematurely. To eliminate the problem, on the second and subsequent days of the bombardment, Porter ordered that all fuses should be cut to full length.

25|$|The pipe wrench, or Stillson wrench, is an {{adjustable}} wrench used for turning soft iron {{pipes and fittings}} with a rounded surface.

25|$|Conventional {{twist drill}} bits tend to wander when {{presented}} to a flat workpiece. For metalwork, this is countered by drilling a pilot hole with a spotting drill bit. In wood, the lip and spur drill bit is another solution: The {{centre of the}} drill bit is given not the straight chisel of the twist drill bit, but a spur with a sharp point and four sharp corners to cut the wood. The sharp point of the spur simply pushes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> wood to keep the drill bit in line.|$|E

50|$|Histological septa {{are seen}} {{throughout}} most tissues of the body, particularly {{where they are}} needed to stiffen soft cellular tissue, and they also provide planes of ingress for small blood vessels. Because the dense collagen fibres of a septum usually extend out <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>softer</b> adjacent tissues, microscopic fibrous septa are less clearly defined than the macroscopic types of septa listed above. In rare instances, a septum is a cross-wall. Thus it divides a structure into smaller parts.|$|R

This allows the full diameter of the workpiece to be machined in a single operation, this contrasts with the usual requirement where a carrier is attached to the workpiece at the driven end.

25|$|The trumpet is a {{notoriously}} hard instrument on the lips, and Armstrong suffered from lip damage {{over much of}} his life due to his aggressive style of playing and preference for narrow mouthpieces that would stay in place easier, but which tended to dig <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> flesh of his inner lip. During his 1930s European tour, he suffered an ulceration so severe that he had to stop playing entirely for a year. Eventually he took to using salves and creams on his lips and also cutting off scar tissue with a razor blade. By the 1950s, he was an official spokesman for Ansatz-Creme Lip Salve.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} morning {{of the first day}} of battle, small parties of Indians dashed up to the sand bar on horseback several times, but they did little damage to the scouts.

Later they crawled through the grass and shot through the grass. Several scouts who were killed or wounded were hit by the Indian snipers hidden in the grass. The Indians surrounded the island and repeatedly attacked the Scouts. Three scouts hidden in hole on the riverbank shot several Indians from the shore.|$|E
25|$|After a {{few days}} to recover from their flight and {{practice}} in the nets the MCC went to play a Country team at Moora, Western Australia. These country games were popular with the Australian Board of Control as they promoted cricket away from the cities and the tourists as they provided easy games. There were nine such games on the tour and they could pall after a while, but the players were feted by the locals and some regarded them as the most enjoyable part of the tour. The MCC batted first and made 232/7 with John Edrich making 66 with 11 fours, Jim Parks 48, M.J.K. Smith 36, Fred Titmus 36 not out and the spinner Terry Gale 3/57. Ken Higgs (2/8) quickly removed the opener Pascoe for a duck and Gale for 3, but was taken off after four overs as he sank <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> turf. A young farmer named John McCormack (64) added 122 runs for the next two wickets before being bowled by Fred Titmus (3/34). From 133/3 the country team unexpectedly fell to 150 all out thanks to the leg-spin of Bob Barber whose 0/56 became 5/64 after changing from cricket boots to light shoes. The MCC won by 82 runs, though there is a discrepancy in the scorecard as only two batsmen are recorded being dismissed by Titmus while Barber has six victims.|$|E

50|$|Trichorrhexis invaginata, or bamboo hair, is a {{hair shaft}} {{abnormality}} that occurs {{as a result}} of an intermittent keratinizing defect of the hair cortex. Incomplete conversion of the sulfhydryl -SH group onto S-S disulfide bonds in the protein of the cortical fibers leads to cortical softness and subsequent invagination of the fully keratinized distal hair shaft <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>softer,</b> abnormally keratinized proximal hair shaft. Intussusception of the distal hair shaft <b>into</b> <b>the</b> proximal hair shaft results in a distinctive ball-and-socket hair shaft deformity. The affected hairs are brittle and breakage is common, resulting in short hairs.|$|R

25|$|A {{section of}} this housing, on Santa Isabel Alley, was torn down and {{replaced}} by the National Theater in the latter 19th century. During the late 19th century and very early 20th, this theatre {{was the site of}} most of Mexico City's high culture, presenting events such as theatre, operettas, Viennese dance and more. It was then decided to replace this building with a more opulent one for the upcoming Centennial of Mexican Independence celebrations in 1910. The old theatre was demolished in 1901, and the new theatre would be called the Gran Teatro de √ìpera. The work was awarded to Italian architect Adamo Boari, who favored neoclassical and art nouveau styles and who is responsible for the Palacio del Correo which is across the street. Adamo Boari promised in October 1904 to build a grand metallic structure, which at that time only existed in the United States, but not to this size. The first stone of the building was placed by Porfirio D√≠az in 1904. Despite the 1910 deadline, by 1913, the building was hardly begun with only a basic shell. One {{reason for this is that}} the project became more complicated than anticipated as the heavy building sank <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> spongy subsoil. The other reason was the political and economic instability that would lead to the Mexican Revolution. Full hostilities suspended construction of the palace completely and Adamo Boari returned to Italy.|$|E

500|$|Trauma {{to parts}} of the {{respiratory}} system other than the lungs, such as rupture of a bronchial tube, may also cause subcutaneous emphysema. Air may travel upward to the neck from a pneumomediastinum that results from a bronchial rupture, or downward from a torn trachea or larynx <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> tissues of the chest. It may also occur with fractures of the facial bones, neoplasms, during asthma attacks, when the Heimlich maneuver is used, and during [...] childbirth. [...] It is estimated to occur with pneumomediastinum in one in every 2000‚Äì100,000 deliveries. Injury with pneumatic tools, those that are driven by air, is also known to cause subcutaneous emphysema, even in extremities (the arms and legs). [...] It can also occur {{as a result of}} rupture of the esophagus; when it does, it is usually as a late sign.|$|E
40|$|A phase {{field model}} is {{presented}} to investigate dislocation formation (coherency loss) and workhardening in two-phase binary alloys. In our model the elastic energy density is a periodic function of the shear and tetragonal strains, which allows multiple formation of slips (dislocation dipoles). By numerically integrating the dynamic equations in two dimensions, we find that dislocations appear in pairs in the interface region and grow into slips. One end of each slip glides preferentially <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>softer</b> region, while <b>the</b> other end remains trapped at the interface. Under uniaxial stretching at deep quenching, slips appear in <b>the</b> <b>softer</b> regions and do not penetrate <b>into</b> <b>the</b> harder domains, giving rise to an increase of the stress with increasing applied strain in plastic flow.

25|$|Malic acid can {{be further}} reduced during the {{winemaking}} process through malolactic fermentation or MLF. In this process, bacteria convert the stronger malic acid <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>softer</b> lactic acid; formally, malic acid is polyprotic (contributes multiple protons, here two), while lactic acid is monoprotic (contributes one proton), and thus has only half the effect on acidity (pH); also, the first acidity constant (pKa) of malic acid (3.4 at room temperature) {{is lower than the}} (single) acidity constant of lactic acid (3.86 at room temperature), indicating stronger acidity. Thus after MLF, wine has a higher pH (less acidic), and a different mouthfeel.|$|R

A German counter-barrage began within a minute of the advance and as British troops took cover, German machine-gunners fired at the crater lips of shell-holes, through which bullets penetrated and hit the soldiers sheltering inside. The effect of the German barrage was worst on the right flank and added to German machine-gun fire from the Brewery and Helles House strong points; the situation at Requette Farm was not known as all runners sent from the area were killed. Mud clogged weapons of all types and at [...] a British trench-mortar battery and some supporting machine-guns had to cease fire, because of wet and dirty ammunition. At noon, German counter-attacks towards the west end of Poelcappelle began and lasted all afternoon, the Germans trying to exploit a gap between the British 4th and 18th divisions. Defensive positions in shell-holes were held by the survivors of the British attack.|$|E
500|$|In the 1950s {{research}} was being conducted at Cambridge University in England on blood flow in living organisms. These workers devised {{a method of}} constructing a chamber of titanium which was then embedded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>soft</b> tissue of the ears of rabbits. In 1952 the Swedish orthopaedic surgeon, Per-Ingvar Br√•nemark, was interested in studying bone healing and regeneration. During his research time at Lund University he adopted the Cambridge designed [...] "rabbit ear chamber" [...] {{for use in the}} rabbit femur. Following the study, he attempted to retrieve these expensive chambers from the rabbits and found that he was unable to remove them. Br√•nemark observed that bone had grown into such close proximity with the titanium that it effectively adhered to the metal. Br√•nemark carried out further studies into this phenomenon, using both animal and human subjects, which all confirmed this unique property of titanium. Leonard Linkow, in the 1950s, {{was one of the first}} to insert titanium and other metal implants into the bones of the jaw. Artificial teeth were then attached to these pieces of metal. In 1965 Br√•nemark placed his first titanium dental implant into a human volunteer. He began working in the mouth as it was more accessible for continued observations and there was a high rate of missing teeth in the general population offered more subjects for widespread study. He termed the clinically observed adherence of bone with titanium as [...] "osseointegration".|$|E
