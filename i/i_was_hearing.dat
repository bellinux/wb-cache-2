[...] Idolator blogger Sam Lansky commented that, for the fans, [...] "Something New" [...] is [...] "a welcome relief to [...] have an injection of fresh energy into the stagnant girl group scene," [...] and concluded that, [...] "given that this may be the group's final single before disbanding for good, they're certainly going out on a high note, with a track that feels quintessentially Aloud but retooled for 2012." [...] Rebecca Twomey of Marie Claire said that the group is [...] "on key with the current trend for dance music with their new song," [...] while noting that they have [...] "clearly taken inspiration from Cheryl's Call My Name." [...] Katy Brand of The Daily Telegraph was critical towards the song. Brand said that the lyrics [...] "are the usual post-Spice fare," [...] but commented that [...] "the images weren't quite matching the words. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hearing</b> the battle cry of enraged queens who will be oppressed no longer; I was watching five young women wearing identical orange mini-dresses, strutting up and down in perfect synchronicity, like catwalk models." ...|$|E

You may remember that I missed almost no performance which you conducted, saw only you and was happy.

You appeared to me like a God governing all the powerful elements and working enchantments on men.

Stephen Malkmus of Pavement has been {{quoted as saying}} [...] "I played Can's Ege Bamyası album every night before I went to sleep for about three years." [...] Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth recalls, [...] "I found Ege Bamyası in the 49-cent bin at Woolworth's. I didn't see {{anything}} written about Can, I didn't know anything about them except this okra can on the cover, which seemed completely bizarre. I finally picked that record up, and I completely wore it out. It was so alluring. Something about it made Can seem to be playing outside of rock 'n' roll.

2500|$|Serious Young Insects {{had formed}} in 1980 with Peter Farnan on vocals and guitar, Michael Vallance on vocals and bass guitar and Mark White on vocals and drums. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, {{described}} Serious Young Insects as a [...] "quirky, three-piece Melbourne new wave band". They issued an album, Housebreaking (May 1982), and three singles. Lisa Perry of The Canberra Times praised the album [...] "several times I {{had to check}} the cover {{to see if there}} were not also some session musos or others contributing to the sounds <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hearing.</b> For a three-piece combo, these lads sure make a good sound". Pleasance, a classically trained guitarist, was a fan and briefly joined the group before it broke up in the following year.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1887, Thérèse {{approached}} her 63-year-old father Louis, who {{was recovering from}} a small stroke, while {{he sat in the}} garden one Sunday afternoon and told him that she wanted to celebrate the anniversary of [...] "her conversion" [...] by entering Carmel before Christmas. Louis and Thérèse both broke down and cried, but Louis got up, gently picked a little white flower, root intact, and gave it to her, explaining the care with which God brought it into being and preserved it until that day. Thérèse later wrote: [...] "while I listened I believed <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hearing</b> my own story". To Therese, the flower seemed a symbol of herself, [...] "destined to live in another soil". Thérèse renewed her attempts to join the Carmel, but the priest-superior of the monastery would not allow it on account of her youth.|$|E

2500|$|While <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>hearing</b> the boys’ confessions on {{the evening}} of the 5th [...] I was {{suddenly}} terrorized by the sight of a celestial person who presented himself to my mind’s eye. He had in his hand a sort of weapon like a very long sharp-pointed steel blade which seemed to emit fire. At the very instant that I saw all this, I saw that person hurl the weapon into my soul with all his might. I cried out with difficulty and felt I was dying. I asked the boy to leave because I felt ill and no longer had the strength to continue. This agony lasted uninterruptedly until the morning of the 7th. I cannot tell you how much I suffered during this period of anguish. Even my entrails were torn and ruptured by the weapon, and nothing was spared. From that day on I have been mortally wounded. I feel in the depths of my soul a wound that is always open and which causes me continual agony.|$|E

60|$|As to Vandyke, though evidently a fine painter, he is {{one whose}} mind does not move me. He adds nothing to my stock of thoughts--awakens no emotion.

A certain amount of wildness in a young man is quite proper in the best set, provided that he is wild in the right company. Every one knows that young Lord Datchet was ejected from the Empire Music-Hall on Boat-Race night every year during his residence at Oxford University, but nobody minds. The family treats it as a joke. But James has such low tastes. Professional pugilists! I believe that many years ago it was not unfashionable for young men in Society to be seen about with such persons, but those days are over. I shall certainly speak to James. He cannot afford to call attention to himself in any way. That breach-of-promise case of his three years ago, is, I hope and trust, forgotten, but the slightest slip on his part might start the papers talking about it again, and that would be fatal.
