40|$|<b>Mixed</b> <b>sand-gravel</b> beaches {{act as an}} {{efficient}} natural sea defence and are increasingly managed by beach recharge, which can alter the sediment size composition of such beaches and their profile response. This creates an urgent need for better information about the behaviour of mixed sand and gravel beaches after recharge. UAS promise to be a promising novel tool in this context. To test their suitability for routine surveying, we aligned an experimental UAS survey along the standard monitoring schedule that was in operation for a mixed beach in East Sussex, UK. High wind speeds {{at the time of}} deployment significantly affected the data collection, but it was possible to generate (i) a surface model using Structure-from-Motion-based photogrammetry and (ii) an image mosaic that clearly identifies the spatial patterns of the <b>sand-gravel</b> <b>mix</b> of the beach. This indicates that UAS offer substantial potential for beach monitoring. However, an unclear legal framework acts and the sensitivity of platforms to high winds sets clear limits for UAS to serve as a stand-alone monitoring tool for beach environments at the present time...|$|R
40|$|Eastern pearlshells are {{generally}} found in cold, nutrient-poor, unpolluted trout streams and smaller rivers with moderate flow rates. Benthic substrate is usually sand, fine gravel, or a <b>sand-gravel</b> <b>mix</b> where mussels can bury themselves (Spoo 2008). This species has a circumboreal distribution in northern Europe, eastern North America, and Eurasia. Its range includes the arctic and temperate regions of western Russia, westwards through Europe to the north-eastern seaboard of North America and southwards to the Iberian peninsula and "central " Europe. In North America, it is distributed from Newfoundland and Labrador down to Pennsylvania (Burch 1975) and Delaware and {{west to the}} Appalachian mountains (Ziuganov et al. 1994). Current Threats: Impacts to water quality from coal mining have eradicated the eastern pearlshell from all but a very few locations in Pennsylvania.

40|$|The {{impact of}} three storms on the Delaware beaches during 2009 {{provided}} an opportunity to investigate profile changes induced by multiple storms and post-storm recovery on a <b>mixed</b> <b>sand-gravel</b> beach. The distal passage of Hurricane Bill and the associated swells induced beach accretion, as typical of summer months. One of the first winter storms, on October 18 th, eroded the summer beach substantially. The much more energetic November Nor 2 ̆ 7 Easter also induced considerable beach and dune erosion. A ridge and runnel system developed immediately after the storm and covered the post-storm gravel beach surface. No storm bars were formed following all three storms. Significant spatial and rapid temporal variations of grain size occurred. Without considering the grain size variations and selective transport, beach erosion and offshore deposition was over-predicted by SBEACH...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{beach profile}} surveys {{acquired}} {{over more than}} a decade at a sandy beach (Narrabeen Beach, New South Wales, Australia) and a composite sand–gravel beach (Milford-on-Sea, Christchurch Bay, UK) are analysed to compare and contrast cross-shore morphodynamics of the two beach types. The different behavioural characteristics of the two beach types at decadal, inter-annual and intra-annual time scales are investigated. Comparisons of beach profiles with Dean's equilibrium profile and Vellinga's erosion profile show that the Dean's profile satisfactorily represents the time mean profiles of both beach types. Statistical and Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analyses confirm the generally accepted model that the inter-tidal zone is the most morphodynamically active region on a sandy beach whereas the swash zone is the most dynamic region on a <b>mixed</b> <b>sand–gravel</b> beach. The results also imply that during storms composite sand–gravel beaches may become unstable due to cutback of the upper beach while sandy beaches {{are more likely to be}} unstable as a result of beach lowering due to sediment transport from the inter-tidal zone to the sub-tidal zone during storms. EOF results also show that Milford-on-Sea beach is in a state of steady recession while the Narrabeen Beach shows a cyclic erosion–accretion variability. A multivariate technique (Canonical Correlation Analysis, CCA) shows that on the composite beach a strong correlation exists between incident wave steepness and profile response, which could be attributed to the unsaturated surf zone, whereas on the sandy beach any correlation is much less evident...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{particle}} shape on {{the angle of}} internal friction, and the resulting impact on beach sediment dynamics, is still poorly understood. In areas characterized by sediments of specific shape, particularly non-rounded particles, {{this can lead to}} large departures from the expected sediment dynamics. The steep slope (1 : 10) of the <b>mixed</b> <b>sand–gravel</b> beach at Advocate Harbour is stable in large-scale morphology over decades, despite a high tidal range of 10 m or more, and intense shore-break action during storms. The Advocate sand (d < 2 mm) was found to have an elliptic, plate-like shape (Corey Shape Index, CSI ≈ 0. 2 – 0. 6). High angles of internal friction of this material were determined using direct shear, ranging from φ ≈ 41 to 49 °, while the round to angular gravel was characterized as φ = 33 °. The addition of 25 % of the elliptic plate-like sand-sized material to the gravel led to an immediate increase in friction angle to φ = 38 °. Furthermore, re-organization of the particles occurred during shearing, characterized by a short phase of settling and compaction, followed by a pronounced strong dilatory behavior and an accompanying strong increase of resistance to shear and, thus, shear stress. Long-term shearing (24 h) using a ring shear apparatus led to destruction of the particles without re-compaction. Finally, submerged particle mobilization was simulated using a tilted tray submerged in a water-filled tank. Despite a smooth tray surface, particle motion was not initiated until reaching tray tilt angles of 31 ° and more, being ≥ 7 ° steeper than for motion initiation of the gravel mixtures. In conclusion, geotechnical laboratory experiments quantified the important impact of the elliptic, plate-like shape of Advocate Beach sand on the angles of internal friction of both pure sand and sand–gravel mixtures. The resulting effect on initiation of particle motion was confirmed in tilting tray experiments. This makes it a vivid example of how particle shape can contribute to the stabilization of the beach face...|$|R
40|$|Where the Ashburton river {{meets the}} sea it is impounded by a <b>mixed</b> <b>sand-gravel</b> barrier, formed through {{littoral}} transport of sediment, causing a lagoon to form, locally {{referred to as}} hapua. From the hapua, discharge to the sea is maintained through small, ephemeral channels, which are unstable and are subject to morphological change in response to fluctuations in longshore transport of gravel and variations in river flow rate. There are few descriptions of the morphodynamics of these highly changeable features, particularly changes that occur over short time scales of hours to weeks. To investigate the patterns and processes involved in the migration of drainage channels, several new instruments were trialed. A methodology of was developed to provide estimates of longshore transport on a gravel beach using a Gravel Transport Sensor. Video camera technology was the primary tool used to study river mouth morphodynamics. The camera provided hourly images of the environment, enabling qualitative assessment using movies of the images to observe morphologic changes, and quantitative measurement of the migration of the channel. Measurements of river flow, wave climate and lagoon water levels were also gathered to investigate {{the relationships between the}} morphological response and the forcing factors. Results of the study showed that the ends of the channel behave differently, with the lagoon end remaining more stable than the seaward end. The seaward end is more exposed to the high wave energy prevalent along this coast. The wave climate, especially wave period and direction, were found to be predictors for the migration rate. The location of the seaward end is more variable due to the fluctuations in wave climate, differing from the lagoon end which is influenced predominantly by river flow rates. It has been found that the migration of the lagoon end occurs in 'steps', which are separated by raised gravel banks, the single persistent feature throughout the study. This stepping migration is driven primarily through episodic events such as high river flow or large wave events...|$|R
40|$|Coarse-grained beaches, such as pure gravel (PG), <b>mixed</b> <b>sand-gravel</b> (MSG) and {{composite}} (CSG) beaches, can {{be considered}} {{as one of the most}} resilient non-cohesive morpho-sedimentary coastal environments to energetic wave forcing (e. g., storms). The hydraulically-rough and permeable nature of gravel (D 50 > 2 mm), together with the steep (reflective) beach face, provide efficient mechanisms of wave energy dissipation in the swash zone and provide a natural means of coastal defence. Despite their potential for shore protection very little is known about the response of these environments during high energetic wave conditions. Field measurements of sediment transport and hydrodynamics on coarse-grained beaches are difficult, because there are few instruments capable of taking direct measurements in an energetic swash zone in which large clasts are moving, and significant morphological changes occur within a short period of time. Remote sensing methods emerge in this context as the most appropriate solution for these types of field measurement. A new remote sensing method, based around a mid-range (50 m) 2 D laser-scanner was developed, which allows the collection of swash zone hydrodynamics (e. g., vertical and horizontal runup position, swash depth and velocity) and bed changes on wave-by-wave time scale. This instrument allowed the complete coverage of the swash zone on several coarse-grained beaches with a vertical accuracy of approximately  0. 015 m and an average horizontal resolution of 0. 07 m. The measurements performed with this new methodology are within the accuracy of traditional field techniques (e. g. video cameras, ultrasonic bed-level sensors or dGPS). Seven field experiments were performed between March 2012 and January 2014 on six different coarse-grained beaches (Loe Bar, Chesil, Slapton, Hayling Island, Westward Ho! and Seascale), with each deployment comprising the 2 D laser-scanner together with complementary in-situ instrumentation (e. g., pressure transducer, ADV current meter). These datasets were used to explore the hydrodynamics and morphological response of the swash zone of these different environments under different energetic hydrodynamic regimes, ranging from positive, to zero, to negative freeboard regimes. With reference to the swash zone dynamics under storms with positive freeboard regimes (when runup was confined to the foreshore) it was found that extreme runup has an inverse relationship with the surf scaling parameter (= 2 Hs /gTptan 2 ). The highest vertical runup excursions were found on the steepest beaches (PG beaches) and under long-period swell, while lower vertical runup excursions where linked to short-period waves and beaches with intermediate and dissipative surf zones, thus demonstrating that the contrasting degree of wave dissipation observed in the different types of surf zones is a key factor that control the extreme runup on coarse-grained beaches. Contrasting morphological responses were observed on the different coarse-grained beaches as a result of the distinct swash zone hydrodynamics. PG beaches with narrow surf zone presented an asymmetric morphological response during the tide cycle (accretion during the rising and erosion during the falling tide) as a result of beach step adjustments to the prevailing hydrodynamics. On dissipative MSG and CSG beaches the morphological response was limited due to the very dissipative surf zone, while on an intermediate CSG beach significant erosion of the beach face and berm was observed during the entire tide cycle as a result of the absence of moderate surf zone wave dissipation and beach step dynamics. Fundamental processes related to the link between the beach step dynamics and the asymmetrical morphological response during the tidal cycle were for the first time measured under energetic wave conditions. During the rising tide the onshore shift of the breaking point triggers the onshore translation of the step and favors accretion (step deposit development), while during the falling tide the offshore translation of the wave breaking point triggers retreat of the step and favours backwash sediment transport (erosion of the step deposit). Under zero and negative freeboard storm regimes (when runup exceeds the crest of the barrier or foredune), field measurements complimented by numerical modelling (Xbeach-G) provide clear evidence that the presence of a bimodal wave spectrum enhances the vertical runup and can increase the likelihood of the occurrence of overtopping and overwash events over a gravel barrier. Most runup equations (e. g., Stockdon et al., 2006) used to predict the thresholds for storm impact regime (e. g., swash, overtopping and overwash) on barriers lack adequate characterisation of the full wave spectra; therefore, they may miss important aspects of the incident wave field, such as wave bimodality. XBeach-G allows a full characterization of the incident wave field and is capable of predicting the effect of wave spectra bimodality on the runup, thus demonstrating that is a more appropriate tool for predicting the storm impact regimes on gravel barriers. Regarding the definition of storm impact regimes on gravel barriers, it was found that wave period and wave spectra bimodality are key parameters that can affect significantly the definition of the thresholds for these different regimes. While short-period waves dissipate most of their energy before reaching the swash zone (due to breaking) and produce short runup excursions, long-period waves arrive at the swash zone with enhanced heights (due to shoaling) and break at the edge of the swash, thus promoting large runup excursions. When offshore wave spectrum presents a bimodal shape, the wave transformation on shallow waters favours the long period peak (even if the short-period peak is the most energetic offshore) and large runup excursions occur. XBeach-G simulations show that the morphological response of fine gravel barriers is distinct from coarse gravel barriers under similar overtopping conditions. While on coarser barriers overtopping regimes are expected to increase the crest elevation and narrow the barrier, on fine barriers sedimentation occurs on the back of the barrier and in the lower beach face. Such different sedimentation patterns are attributed to the different hydraulic conductivity of the different sediment sizes which control the amount of flow dissipation (due to infiltration) and, therefore, the capacity of the flow to transport sediment across and over the barrier crest. The present findings have significantly improved our conceptual understanding of the response of coarse-grained beaches during storms. A new field technique to measure swash dynamics in the field was developed during this thesis and has great potential to become widely used in a variety of coastal applications. EPSR...|$|R
