The thesis is composed of seven chapters. Chapter one is introductory with focus on liability for damage in labour law. In {{the beginning of this}} chapter the thesis deals with the division of liability for damage into <b>employer's</b> and employee's <b>liability.</b> The first subchapter brings a brief characterization of contemporary legal regulation of <b>employer's</b> <b>liability</b> for occupational accidents and diseases. The second subchapter concerns with mutual relationship between civil code and labour code and the use of civil code in labour law. In the chapter two, you can find a description of terms occupational accident, damage and causality between occupational accident and damage, which are necessary preconditions of <b>employer's</b> <b>liability</b> for occupational accident. Subsequent chapter is about <b>employer's</b> <b>liability</b> for occupational diseases and is subdivided into three parts. Part one gives an account of term occupational disease. Second part focuses on the list of occupational diseases and the third gives an attention to special institute of endargement by [...] ...|$|R

[...] When oral testimony is taken from physicians, the usual standard is to state an opinion [...] "within a reasonable degree of medical certainty". [...] Worker's compensation laws are dictated by state statute or Federal <b>Employers</b> <b>Liability</b> Act.

[...] However, he generally sided with the [...] "Old Guard" [...] of conservatives who battled with their Progressive counterparts within the party during William Howard Taft's presidency. He was also involved closely with the legal codification of the period and joined Taft in opposing the legislation admitting New Mexico and Arizona into the union because of clauses within their constitutions allowing for the recall of judges.|$|E

40|$|In this Essay, Professor White {{argues that}} the Supreme Court finally has merged {{analysis}} of sexual harassment law with other claims of intentional discrimination. Professor White contends that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson created confusion over the proper analysis of sexual harassment claims by seemingly embracing quid pro quo and hostile work environment theories as distinct forms of discrimination and by suggesting {{that at least some}} sexual harassment claims may warrant a revised approach to <b>employer</b> <b>liability.</b> In the wake of Meritor, sexual harassment claims increasingly were evaluated differently from other claims of disparate treatment, both in determining whether harassment was because of sex and in determining <b>employer</b> <b>liability</b> for the harassment. Last term 2 ̆ 7 s decisions are aimed at ending that distinctive treatment, placing sexual harassment claims firmly in the mainstream of disparate treatment theory. Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc. teaches that unlawful motive in sexual harassment claims is to be evaluated on the same terms as other disparate treatment claims. Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth, and Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, while recognizing and clarifying vicarious <b>employer</b> <b>liability</b> principles for sexual harassment, also should be understood to govern <b>employer</b> <b>liability</b> for all disparate treatment occurring at the hands of supervisors, whether or not sexual harassment is involved. Professor White accordingly contends that the Court 2 ̆ 7 s decisions from last Term have clarified both sexual harassment in particular and disparate treatment law generall...|$|R

40|$|In June, 1998, the Supreme Court issued two decisions, Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth and Faragher v.

Although {{the two cases}} presented different questions and factual predicates, the Court adopted a unified holding with respect to <b>employer</b> <b>liability</b> for supervisor harassment. Many commentators interpreted the new standards as a blow to employers based on the perception that employers would now {{be held accountable for}} workplace harassment without regard to their culpability. The thesis of this article is that the conventional wisdom with respect to Faragher and Ellerth is dead wrong. Those decisions, far from imposing additional <b>liability</b> on innocent <b>employers,</b> have instead created a virtual safe harbor that protects <b>employers</b> from <b>liability</b> unless their own conduct is found wanting.
