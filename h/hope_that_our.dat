[...] Passman also issued a public statement saying that Dodd had not enriched himself while in public office, despite contrary reports presented to Passman. Such reports had come from Earl Long, who was then temporarily estranged from Dodd, but Passman never mentioned the source.|$|E

Lincoln replied that he had observed the city had erected a platform for his use, but his stay would be very brief and the fatigue of his long journey was very great and hoped {{that would not be}} regarded as meaning he would never stand upon another platform, erected in another place. He remarked that an intelligent and happy crowd had assembled to welcome him and he could do nothing more than greet them and bid them farewell with the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> country would continue to prosper forever.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first two}} {{representative}} games were styled as the [...] "Honourable Ivo Bligh's Team versus Mr Murdoch's XI". The Aussies took £200 per player {{in each of}} these games as record-breaking crowds poured into the M.C.G., and the New Year's Day attendance was 23,000. The highlight of the first Test was an innings of 85 in 135 minutes from George Bonnor as Australia made 291 in its first innings. Rain came down during the England innings, making the pitch more difficult than it had been. England, struggling to cope with this, made only 177 and was forced to follow on 114 runs behind. Mr Murdoch's XI won easily by 9 wickets, and the Colonial press saw the victory as confirmation of Australia's superiority. Bligh, however, later commented, [...] "Some of us still cherished the <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> turn was yet to come." ...|$|E

[...] Lu Su replied, [...] "No." [...] All the others present at the scene were startled by Lu Su's response. After taking his seat, Lu Su raised his horsewhip and said, [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> lord will spread his might and virtues throughout the Four Seas, expand his territories to cover the Nine Provinces, and successfully build an empire.

2500|$|After {{explaining}} the domestic policies the US should pursue, he discusses foreign policy. He advocates {{a system of}} [...] "triage," [...] such as that suggested by William and Paul Paddock in Famine 1975!. Under this system countries would be divided into categories based on their abilities to feed themselves going forward. Countries with sufficient programmes in place to limit population growth, {{and the ability to}} become self-sufficient in the future would continue to receive food aid. Countries, for example India, which were [...] "so far behind in the population-food game that there is no <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> food aid will see them through to self-sufficiency" [...] would have their food aid eliminated. Ehrlich argued that this was the only realistic strategy in the long-term. Ehrlich applauds the Paddocks' [...] "courage and foresight" [...] in proposing such a solution. Ehrlich further discusses the need to set up public education programs and agricultural development schemes in developing countries. He argues that the scheme would likely have to be implemented outside the framework of the United Nations due to the necessity of being selective regarding the targeted regions and countries, and suggests that within countries certain regions should be prioritized to the extent that cooperative separatist movements should be encouraged if they are an improvement over the existing authority. He mentions his support for government mandated sterilization of Indian males with three or more children.|$|E
2500|$|On November 30, 2010, [...] the Joint Chiefs of Staff {{released}} the [...] "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" [...] Comprehensive Review Working Group (CRWG) report authored by Jeh C. Johnson, General Counsel of the Department of Defense, and Army General Carter F. Ham. It outlined {{a path to}} the implementation of repeal of DADT. The report indicated that there was a low risk of service disruptions due to repealing the ban, provided time was provided for proper implementation and training. It included the results of a survey of 115,000 active-duty and reserve service members. Across all service branches, 30 percent thought that integrating gays into the military would have negative consequences. In the Marine Corps and combat specialties, the percentage with that negative assessment ranged from 40 to 60 percent. The CRWG also said that 69 percent of all those surveyed believed they had already worked with a gay or lesbian and of those, 92 percent reported that the impact of that person's presence was positive or neutral. The same day, in response to the CRWG, 30 professors and scholars, most from military institutions, issued a joint statement saying that the CRWG [...] "echoes more than 20 studies, including studies by military researchers, all of which reach the same conclusion: allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly will not harm the military .... We <b>hope</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> collective statement underscores that the debate about the evidence is now officially over...." [...] The Family Research Council's president, Tony Perkins, interpreted the CRWG data differently, writing that it [...] "reveals that 40 percent of Marines and 25 percent of the Army could leave".|$|E
