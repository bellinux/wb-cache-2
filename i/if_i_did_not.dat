25|$|The doctor {{warned me}} – {{and so did}} members of my family soon {{afterward}} – that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> keep my epilepsy a secret, people would fear me and I {{would be subject to}} discrimination. Even now, seven years after that scene in the dining hall, it is difficult for me to say that I have epilepsy. Back then, it was impossible. In the years since, I have had hundreds of various types of seizures. I have experienced the mental, physical and emotional side effects caused by changes in the anticonvulsant drugs I take each day. Yet, for the first two years, I refused to learn about epilepsy. My fears of being found out were my real concern.|$|E
25|$|In the Second Test Ray Illingworth {{was put in}} to bat, but Rowan refused {{his request}} for the roller to be used on the wicket before play began. Rowan later {{realised}} his mistake and apologised in the lunch break. Even John Snow applauded when he and Tom Brooks refused to start play at Melbourne in the abandoned Third Test. Ian Johnson and the Melbourne authorities were desperate to get the game going, but the umpires refused to be pressured as the field was quite unfit for play. Snow found Max O'Connell 'a very reasonable and fair man, even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> agree with him' {{and that they could}} talk problems through. Brooks {{was the only one of}} the umpires who had played First Class Cricket – he had been a lively fast-medium bowler – and as a result was more able to connect with the Test players, and was more forgiving of short-pitched deliveries which he saw as a natural part of the game.|$|E

500|$|The {{similarities}} {{begin with}} the first movement, which {{like that of the}} previous year´s cantata, is given to the bass as the vox Christi. The movement is the quotation of verse 7 from the gospel, beginning: [...] "" [...] (It is good for you that I leave; for <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> go, the Comforter would not come to you.) It is between aria and arioso. An oboe d'amore as the obbligato instrument plays extended melodies. Voice and oboe share the musical material, conveying [...] "the mood of grieving at parting".|$|E

The operation of General Bülow upon the enemy's flank was a most decisive one; and, even if I had not found myself in a situation to make the attack which produced the final result, it would have forced the enemy to retire if his attacks should have failed, and would have prevented him from taking advantage of them if they should unfortunately have succeeded".|$|E
500|$|According to the {{composer}} Edmund Rubbra, who studied under {{him in the}} early 1920s, Holst was [...] "a teacher who often came to lessons weighted, not with the learning of Prout and Stainer, but with a miniature score of Petrushka or the then recently published Mass in G minor of Vaughan Williams". He never sought to impose his own ideas on his composition pupils. Rubbra recalled that he would divine a student's difficulties and gently guide him to finding the solution for himself. [...] "I do not recall that Holst added one single note of his own to anything I wrote, but he would suggest—if I agreed!—that, given such and such a phrase, the following one {{would be better if}} it took such and such a course; <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> see this, the point would not be insisted upon...

500|$|Taft {{was sworn}} in as {{president}} on March 4, 1909. Due to a winter storm that coated Washington with ice, Taft was inaugurated within the Senate Chamber rather than outside the Capitol as is customary. The new president stated in his inaugural address that he had been honored to have been [...] "one of the advisers of my distinguished predecessor" [...] and to have had a part [...] "in the reforms he has initiated. I should be untrue to myself, to my promises, and to the declarations of the party platform on which I was elected <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> make the maintenance and enforcement of those reforms a most important feature of my administration". He pledged to make those reforms long-lasting, ensuring that honest businessmen did not suffer uncertainty through change of policy. He spoke of the need for reduction of the 1897 Dingley Tariff, for antitrust reform, and for continued advancement of the Philippines toward full self-government. Roosevelt left office with regret that his tenure in the position he enjoyed so much was over and, to keep out of Taft's way, arranged for a year-long hunting trip to Africa.|$|E
500|$|Case, who had {{previously}} worked on the soap operas General Hospital and As the World Turns, was cast in August 1994. She was selected {{from a group of}} six other possible recasts after a screen testing with co-star Joshua Morrow, and began airing on September 7, 1994. Initially, Case believed she would only be playing the role for a maximum of six months. Of her casting, she stated: [...] "Not only is this my third soap, but I'm also the third actress {{to play the role of}} Sharon Collins. So, if three times is the charm, this should be it." [...] The actress wanted to [...] "breathe new life" [...] into the role and make it her own. In 2003, Case was off-screen from February 17 to May 1, during contract negotiations. These were resolved that April, when she signed a new contract to remain on the show for another four years, until 2007. Case revealed that while she considered leaving the series, [...] "I would not have been negotiating <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> want to come back. I've always had a great story to play.

500|$|Khan married Hameedah Begum (the eldest {{daughter}} of Allama Mashriqi) in 1940. Together, {{they had three}} daughters (Mariam, Amina, and Rasheeda) and a son (Akbar). After Hameedah Begum's death in 1966, he married Shafiq Khan and had one daughter, Ayesha. During his ICS career, Khan worked as collector of revenue, a position that brought him into regular contact with living conditions in rural areas of East Bengal. The Bengal famine of 1943 and subsequent inadequate handling of the situation by the colonial rulers led him to resign from the Indian Civil Service in 1945. He wrote, [...] "I realised that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> escape while I was young and vigorous, I will forever remain in the trap, and terminate as a bureaucratic big wig." [...] During this period, he {{was influenced by the}} philosophy of Nietzsche and Mashriqi, and joined the Khaksar Movement. This attachment was brief. He quit the movement and turned to Sufism. According to Khan, [...] "I had a profound personal concern; I wanted to live a life free from fear and anxiety, a calm and serene life, without turmoil and conflict.when I followed the advice of old Sufis and sages, and tried to curb my greed, my pride and aggression, fears, anxieties and conflict diminished." ...|$|E

500|$|In late January 1567, Mary {{prompted}} {{her husband}} to return to Edinburgh. He recuperated from his illness in a house belonging to the brother of Sir James Balfour at the former abbey of Kirk o' Field, just within the city wall. Mary visited him daily, so that it appeared a reconciliation was in progress. On the night of 9–10 February 1567, Mary visited {{her husband in the}} early evening and then attended the wedding celebrations of a member of her household, Bastian Pagez. In {{the early hours of the}} morning, an explosion devastated Kirk o' Field, and Darnley was found dead in the garden, apparently smothered. There were no visible marks of strangulation or violence on the body. Bothwell, Moray, Secretary Maitland, the Earl of Morton and Mary herself were among those who came under suspicion. Elizabeth wrote to Mary of the rumours, [...] "I should ill fulfil the office of a faithful cousin or an affectionate friend <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not...</b> tell you what all the world is thinking. Men say that, instead of seizing the murderers, you are looking through your fingers while they escape; that you will not seek revenge on those who have done you so much pleasure, as though the deed would never have taken place had not the doers of it been assured of impunity. For myself, I beg you to believe that I would not harbour such a thought." ...|$|E
500|$|USA Todays Robert Bianco credits Monica and Chandler's {{relationship}} and their wedding in the episode [...] "The One With Monica and Chandler's Wedding" [...] with saving Friends. Prior to the episode, the show had [...] "appeared {{to be in}} serious danger of out-staying its welcome." [...] Although admitting that the overall episode [...] "is not one of Friends best", Bianco explained that [...] "The wedding changed all that, and in remarkable fashion." [...] While BuzzFeed ranked Monica and Chandler the 23rd best television couple, E! placed the couple second on its ranking of the greatest Friends couples, with author Sydney Bucksbaum writing, [...] "It's {{hard to imagine a}} time when Monica and Chandler weren't together, but it took them four seasons to actually get together. From then on, it was clear that they were meant to be." [...] Tim Gerstenberger of TV Overmind echoed this sentiment by ranking Chandler Monica's best boyfriend, awarding him an 'A' grade. Gerstenberger penned, [...] "I {{would not be able to}} face myself every day <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> rank Chandler the best of Monica’s boyfriends from Friends. The two ended up getting married, which just goes to show that some one night stands are meant to last." [...] Monica and Ross' relationship was also influential. According to Kriti Tulsiani of IBNLive, the characters [...] "provide a perfect exception to the myth that one cannot find a best friend in their sibling particularly when they are of opposite sex ... they have broken all the conventional boundaries of a brother-sister relationship."

During this time, Joseph Smith, also taught her about plural marriage in private conversations; he proposed that she become his spiritual wife on at least three different occasions. Zina declined the proposals out of her respect for Emma Smith and for traditional Christian monogamy, and because such a union would require secrecy. On March 7, 1841, she married Jacobs, believing she had thus avoided future proposals from Smith. Nauvoo mayor John C. Bennett conducted the ceremony. Her journal from the day of the wedding reads: I was Married to Mr. Henry Bailey Jacobs. He had been a missionary preaching the Gospel for some time. His Father Henry Jacobs {{was one of the first}} elders in the Church, faithful and true until the last.Zina become pregnant shortly after her marriage. However, she continued to feel concern that she had rejected God by rejecting Joseph, whom she considered a prophet and God's spokesperson. Later she recorded, [...] "I received a testimony for myself from the Lord of this work, and that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God before I ever saw him, while I resided in the state of New York, given in answer to prayer. I knew him in his lifetime, and know him to have been a great true man and a servant of God." [...] Smith wrote to her in October 1841 that he had [...] "put it off till an angel with a drawn sword stood by me and told me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> establish that principle [...] upon the earth I would lose my position and my life."
