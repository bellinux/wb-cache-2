Each questionnaire {{consists of}} five sections: (1) title, (2) instructions, (3) demographic questions, (4) screening questions, and (5) segmentation task; both simplified and traditional Chinese character versions are provided. Section 3, demographic questions, asks the online subjects (all {{of the subjects}} are volunteers) to provide their identity information on gender, age, level of education, and <b>email</b> address (<b>optional).</b> Section 4, screening questions, consists of four simple questions on the Chinese language {{which can be used}} to test if a subject is a Chinese speaker or not; the first two questions are open-ended Chinese character identification questions. Each question shows a picture containing a simple Chinese character and asks the subject to identify and type it in a text box below it. The third question is a close-ended homophonic character identification question. It shows the subject a character and asks him/her to identify its homophonic character in 10 different characters. The fourth one is a close-ended antonymous character identification question asking the subject to identify the antonymous character of the given one from 10 different characters. The sections 4 s of the eight crowdsourcing tasks share the same question types but have different question instances. Section 5, the segmentation task, shows the subjects 19 sentences and asks them to insert a word boundary symbol (“/”) at each word boundary they perceive. The subjects are required to insert a “/” behind each punctuation and the last character of a sentence. The subjects are also informed that they need not to care about if their judgments are right or wrong, but just follow their intuitions.|$|R

Participants were assigned a physical activity goal and were asked to record each physical activity episode into the activity log for eight weeks. Statistics for program reach, effectiveness, adoption, and implementation were calculated using the Re-Aim framework. Multilevel regression analyses were used to assess the decline in rates of data entry and goal attainment during the program, to assess the likelihood of joining a team by demographic characteristics, to test the association between various predictors and the number of weeks an individual met his or her goal, and to analyze server load. Results Overall, 7, 483 individuals registered with the Active U website (≈ 16 % of eligible), and 79 % participated in the program by logging valid data at least once. Staff members, older participants, and those with a BMI < 25 were more likely to meet their weekly physical activity goals, and average rate of meeting goals was higher among participants who joined a competitive team compared to those who participated individually (IRR = 1. 28, P <. 001). Conclusion Internet-mediated physical activity interventions that focus on physical activity logging and goal setting while incorporating team competition may help a significant percentage of the target population maintain their physical activity during the winter months...|$|R
40|$|We present Lightweight Email Signatures (LES), {{a simple}} {{cryptographic}} architecture for authenticating email. LES {{is an extension}} of DKIM, the recent IETF effort to standardize domain-based email signatures. LES shares DKIM’s ease of deployment: they both use the DNS to distribute a single public key for each domain. Importantly, LES supports common uses of email that DKIM jeopardizes: multiple email personalities, firewalled ISPs, incoming-only email forwarding services, and other common uses that often require sending email via a third-party SMTP server. In addition, LES does not require DKIM’s implied intra-domain mechanism for authenticating users when they send email. LES provides these features using identity-based signatures. Each domain authority generates a master keypair, publishes the public component in the DNS, and stores the private component securely. Using this private component, the authority delivers to each of its users, via email, an individual secret key whose identity string corresponds to the user’s email address. A sender then signs messages using this individual secret key. A recipient verifies such a signature by querying the appropriate master public key from the DNS, computing the sender’s public key, and verifying the signature accordingly. As an added bonus, the widespread availability of user-level public keys enables deniable authentication, such as ring signatures. Thus, LES provides <b>email</b> authentication with <b>optional</b> repudiability. We built a LES prototype to determine its practicality. Basic user tests show that the system is relatively easy to use, and that cryptographic performance, even when using deniable authentication, is well within acceptable range.
