5|$|After the {{formation}} of the Fox-North Coalition, Mansfield agreed to act as Speaker of the House of Lords, taking up his post in February 1783. The main item of debate during the Coalition Ministry was the East India Bill, which provoked bitter arguments in both the House of Lords and House of Commons. In an attempt to speed up the process of passing the bill, Mansfield left his position as Speaker to debate directly on 15 December; when this failed to help he returned to the Woolsack the next day.

5|$|George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore (1579 – 15 April 1632) was an English {{politician}} and coloniser. He achieved domestic political {{success as a}} member of parliament and later Secretary of State under King James I. He lost much of his political power after his support for a failed marriage alliance between Prince Charles and the Spanish House of Habsburg royal family. Rather than continue in politics, he resigned all of his political offices in 1625 except for <b>his</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> the Privy Council and declared his Catholicism publicly. He was created Baron Baltimore in the Irish peerage upon his resignation. Baltimore Manor was located in County Longford, Ireland.|$|E

Although created by a decree of 1856 (following a {{suggestion}} made by Joaquim Inácio in 1851), the first professional firefighter corps in Brazil was effectively formed under his tenure {{at the head of}} the Ministry of Agriculture. The cabinet resigned on 24 May 1862 after losing its majority in the Chamber of Deputies (the national legislature's lower house). Joaquim Inácio returned to <b>his</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> the naval council on 2 July and left that post when he became a member of the Supreme Military and Justice Council on 2 October 1864.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Romney {{revealed}} {{a change of}} view regarding abortion, moving from the pro-choice positions expressed during his 1994 and 2002 campaigns to a pro-life one in opposition to Roe v. Wade. Romney attributed his conversion to an interaction with Harvard University biologist Douglas Melton, an expert on embryonic stem cell biology, although Melton vehemently disputed Romney's recollection of their conversation. Romney subsequently vetoed a bill on pro-life grounds that expanded access to emergency contraception in hospitals and pharmacies (the legislature overrode the veto). He also amended <b>his</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> {{embryonic stem cell research}} itself.|$|E

5|$|In 280 BC, Pyrrhus {{embarked}} on a campaign in Magna Graecia (i.e. southern Italy) against the Roman Republic known as the Pyrrhic War, followed by his invasion of Sicily. Ptolemy Keraunos secured <b>his</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> the Macedonian throne by giving Pyrrhus five thousand soldiers and twenty war elephants for this endeavor. Pyrrhus returned to Epirus in 275BC after the ultimate failure of both campaigns, which contributed {{to the rise of}} Rome because Greek cities in southern Italy such as Tarentum now became Roman allies. Pyrrhus invaded Macedonia in 274BC, defeating the largely mercenary army of AntigonusII at the 274BC Battle of Aous and driving him out of Macedonia, forcing him to seek refuge with his naval fleet in the Aegean.|$|E

In 1973 Zhu was reinstated in the Standing Committee.|$|E
5|$|In September 2009, Vancouver re-signed Luongo to a 12-year extension. As such, it {{was widely}} speculated that Schneider would inevitably be traded.

Regardless, he publicly maintained he was unfazed by <b>his</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> the Canucks' depth chart {{and that he was}} focused on competing with the newly acquired Andrew Raycroft for the Canucks' backup position in 2009–10.

5|$|Marshall {{was inaugurated}} as Governor of Indiana on January 11, 1909. Since his party {{had been out}} of power for many years, its initial {{objective}} was to appoint as many Democrats as possible to patronage positions. Marshall tried to avoid becoming directly involved in the patronage system. He allowed the party's different factions to have positions and appointed very few of his own choices. He allowed Taggart to manage the process and pick the candidates, but signed off himself on the official appointments. Although <b>his</b> <b>position</b> <b>on</b> patronage kept peace in his party, it prevented him from building a strong political base.|$|E
