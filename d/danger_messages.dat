40|$|This {{exploratory}} study examines student interpretations {{of pleasure and}} <b>danger</b> <b>messages</b> about sex in sexuality lesson plans. Scripting theory suggests that students do not simply hear and enact sexual scripts presented to them in sexuality education, but instead actively interpret, revise, weigh and attach meaning to these messages. We conducted a qualitative content analysis of student essays that responded to four sexuality education lesson plans. Our data show that, regardless {{of the content of}} the lessons, the interpretations of the pleasure and <b>danger</b> <b>messages</b> vary widely, with some students interpreting a lesson as completely danger-focused, others interpreting it as completely pleasure-focused and still others arguing its objectivity. We discuss several themes evident in the data that suggest reasons for this variation. We conclude that understanding the complex process of interpreting sex education messages is important to understanding how to make sex education maximally effective...|$|E
40|$|Infants {{are a very}} {{vulnerable}} population who undergo numerous common, yet painful, medical procedures, such as immunizations. Infants use social referencing, a complex level of communication and learning, during novel situations (i. e. medical procedures) to establish how they should react in novel situations. If the infant's mother is fearful of needles she may inadvertently send these <b>danger</b> <b>messages</b> to her infant making the immunization process a more painful experience for the infant. It was found that neither maternal self-reported needle fear nor maternal fear behaviour influenced infants' pain expression during immunizations. Results, however, did indicate that immediately following the immunization males, 12 -months of age, exhibited more guarded body movement than males 18 -months of age. It was also found that females, 12 -months of age, exhibited more guarded body movement than females 18 -months of age prior to the immunization.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{approach}} to wireless sensor network assisted navigation while avoiding moving dangers. Our approach relies on an embedded roadmap in the sensor network that always contains safe paths. The roadmap is adaptive, i. e., it adapts its topology to changing dangers. Mobile robots in the environment use the roadmap to reach their destinations. We evaluated the performance of embedded roadmap both in simulations using realistic conditions and with real hardware. Our results show that the proposed navigation algorithm is better suited for sensor networks than traditional navigation field based algorithms. Our observations suggest that there are two drawbacks of traditional navigation field based algorithms, (i) increased power consumption, (ii) message congestion that can prevent important <b>danger</b> avoidance <b>messages</b> to be received by the robots. In contrast, our approach significantly reduces the number of messages on the network (up to 160 times in some scenarios) while increasing the navigation performance. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Inter-Vehicle Communication (IVC) and its diverse {{possibilities}} for telematics and on-line safety applications {{have led to}} great interest in both academia and industry. Especially the broadcast-based dissemination of automatically generated, local <b>danger</b> warning <b>messages</b> in such networks bears huge potential to increase both driver safety and comfort. However, the shared wireless medium that {{is used for the}} data exchange may quickly become overloaded. To enable inter-vehicular networks that work properly in case of varying network load and vehicle density, novel approaches must be defined that ensure the reliable and timely delivery of highly relevant messages. In this work, we propose a holistic framework that spans over both the application and the MAC layer and facilitates the scalability of VANETs by introducing information differentiation. We present diverse strategies to modify the packet broadcast sequence as well as the MAC functionality according to the benefit which messages are expected to provide to adjacent network nodes. A comprehensive simulation setup is leveraged to prove the advantages of our concept. ...|$|R

Buffering at the multicast receivers can be used to minimize the playback degradation due to network delay variations. Addressing packet losses is more problematic. Solutions are constrained by the long latencies that may exist between the source and some of its receivers, the <b>danger</b> of simultaneous <b>messages</b> from a large number of receivers overwhelming network and endsystem resources (multicast implosion), and the limited bandwidth available on most wide-area links.

Validation analyses revealed that these groups differed in terms of how they responded to perceived climate change threats, and also in their support for particular climate change mitigation and adaptation policies.   Phase 2 of the project examined how Australian interpretive communities respond to climate change adaptation messages and identified the specific message attributes that drive these responses. 1, 031 Australian residents (aged 18 to 66 years, 49. 8 % male, 50. 2 % female) completed an online survey assessing a similar set of psychological and behavioural responses to climate change to those assessed in Phase 1.   Respondents subsequently viewed six climate change adaptation messages that were randomly allocated from a pool of 60 messages sourced from the internet.   Messages were pre-coded on 10 communication cues (e. g., language complexity, normative influence), and respondents rated them on four judgement dimensions: perceived threat, perceived efficacy, fear control (<b>message</b> rejection), and <b>danger</b> control (<b>message</b> acceptance).   Latent profile analysis applied to the psychological variables identified three climate change interpretive communities in this sample: Alarmed (34. 4 %), Uncommitted (45. 2 %), and Dismissive (20. 3 %).   Judgement analysis methodology (Cooksey, 1996) found that the three interpretive communities based their threat and efficacy evaluations on unique combinations of communication cues, and that high perceived threat and high perceived efficacy were related to message acceptance for all communities.   Effective messages for Dismissive respondents used simple language and did not emphasise descriptive social norms.   Uncommitted audience members responded positively to messages that focused on preventing losses and had a strong emotional component.   Alarmed respondents preferred messages that focused on local issues and had a collectivist frame.  Providing specific adaptation advice in messages was found to be effective for all communities.

"Home work is an interesting film for review because it focused on the life of a drug addict with a display state of reality and genuine culture of Indonesia. Therefore, the authors are interested to uncover the meaning of the dangers of drugs contained in the film. Here, the authors are interested to study non-verbal meaning of the film. The meaning of meaning is the meaning of non-verbal communication through movement, attitude, expression, or gesture Because according to the author in the form of non-verbal messages more quickly accepted by the communicant than verbal messages in the form of words. From the background mentioned above, the authors then attempt to uncover the meanings of non-verbal <b>messages</b> <b>dangers</b> of drug abuse in the film "Home work" of the review of semiotic analysis. The research methodology used in this semiotic analysis is interpretive. In accordance with the critical paradigm, semiotic analysis is qualitative. This research provides a great opportunity for alternative interpretations made. Semiotic analysis theory used by the author in this case is the concept of Pierce that examines the relationship between sign and object analysis from the perspective of interpretant. In this study, which included within the scope of the study was the movie "Home work". In this research, not every scene investigation, which studied is non-verbal messages in a scene that has a meaning of the dangers of drugs.

From the semiotic analysis of the writer of the film "Home work", meaning non-verbal messages that implied the dangers of drugs based on the scene under study is that the life of an addict is always in danger, from the dangers of drug use itself, such as withdrawal and overdose, to the hazards of being chased apparatus for breaking the law. Even the effort to cure a drug addict in itself dangerous because rehabilitation efforts either through drugs or therapies are all painful for a drug addict.
