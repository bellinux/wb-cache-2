5|$|Judging {{that both}} {{national}} governments and global institutions have proven ineffective in addressing worldwide problems {{that go beyond}} the capacity of individual nation-states to solve, some political scientists critical of New World Order conspiracism, such as Mark C. Partridge, argue that regionalism will be the major force in the coming decades, pockets of power around regional centers: Western Europe around Brussels, the Western Hemisphere around Washington, D.C., East Asia around Beijing, and Eastern Europe around Moscow. As such, the E.U., the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, and the G-20 will likely become more influential as time progresses. The question then is not whether global governance is gradually emerging, but rather <b>how</b> <b>will</b> these regional powers interact with one another.|$|E

25|$|In 1987, Anthrax {{released}} {{their third}} album Among the Living, which borrowed elements from their two previous releases, with fast guitar riffs and pounding drums.

25|$|But <b>how</b> <b>will</b> this {{solve the}} problem of, given a set of numbers, finding a subset whose product is a square? The {{solution}} uses {{the concept of an}} exponent vector. For example, the prime-power factorization of 504 is 23325071. It can be represented by the exponent vector (3,2,0,1), which gives the exponents of 2, 3, 5, and 7 in the prime factorization. The number 490 would similarly have the vector (1,0,1,2). Multiplying the numbers is the same as componentwise adding their exponent vectors: (504)(490) has the vector (4,2,1,3).|$|E
500|$|This factor {{also worked}} in reverse; while Hannah de Rothschild was keen to marry Rosebery, {{she was also}} aware of many obstacles, the {{foremost}} being that she was devoted to her faith, and to leave {{it would be a}} severe moral wrench. Another obstacle was the Rothschild family itself: it was their custom to marry cousins to keep their fortune within the family. Ironically, Hannah herself had opposed the marriage of her cousin Annie de Rothschild to the Christian Eliot Yorke, the son of the Earl of Hardwicke, in 1866. In fact, she was to be the third daughter of the family's English branch to marry outside of the Jewish faith, but such was the fame of the bridegroom and the resultant publicity that the Jewish elders and press felt an example needed to be made. The Jewish Chronicle announced its [...] "most poignant grief" [...] at the prospect, and cryptically added, [...] "If the flame seize on the cedars, <b>how</b> <b>will</b> fare the hyssop on the wall: if the leviathan is brought up with a hook, <b>how</b> <b>will</b> the minnows escape," [...] demonstrating what a threat to the social fabric of the Jewish faith the Jewish elders saw in the prospect of such a marriage. The quotation, originally from the Babylonian Talmud, can be taken to mean that the elders and respected members and more notable members of the Jewish faith should set a good example by strictly following the teachings of the Jewish articles of faith which frown upon marriage to members of other religions.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the episode}} aired, the CTW {{conducted}} {{a series of}} studies to guide the writers and producers in creating the episode. [...] Their goal was to answer four key questions: (1) Will children understand the messages they wanted to convey about death? (2) How attentive will they be to the storyline? (3) <b>How</b> <b>will</b> parents respond to the treatment of such a sensitive topic? and (4) Will children be disturbed by the messages, and if so, for how long? [...] The researchers broke up children into three groups: children who only watched the scenes in which the storyline was played out and who were interviewed afterwards; children who watched the entire episode and whose attention was recorded while they viewed it; and children who watched the episode without the inserts, with their parents, who were interviewed 9 or 10 days later.|$|E

500|$|In 2010 Entertainment Weekly {{reported}} a planned spin-off television series, 2013, {{which would have}} been a sequel to the film. 2012 executive producer Mark Gordon told the magazine, [...] "ABC will have an opening in their disaster-related programming after Lost ends, so people would be interested in this topic on a weekly basis. There's hope for the world despite the magnitude of the 2012 disaster as seen in the film. After the movie, {{there are some people who}} survive, and the question is <b>how</b> <b>will</b> these survivors build a new world and what will it look like. That might make an interesting TV series." [...] However, plans were later canceled for budgetary reasons. It would have been Emmerich's third film to spawn a spin-off; the first was Stargate (followed by Stargate SG-1, Stargate Infinity, Stargate Atlantis, Stargate Universe), and the second was Godzilla (followed by the animated [...] ).|$|E
500|$|Stone {{addressed}} how {{the writers}} kept Todd on the OLTL canvas, stating, [...] "Characters {{as dangerous as}} Todd go up in flames on soaps. You can see little coffins on their eyelids, leaving only one question: <b>how</b> <b>will</b> the fiend get whacked?" [...] Stone said that [...] "Todd was this close to being offed, but Howarth made that choice laughable. Rampaging through fictional Llanview, he injected ambiguity into the bluntest dialogue, his sneers averting cynicism to reveal depression and humor" [...] and [...] "transformed Todd into a soul-wrenched Lucifer, his rage ripped from abuse and bathed in vengeful glee, his sexiness rising off his instinct for survival and his outlaw impulse to disrupt." [...] She added, [...] "Even the ragged scar he acquired on one cheek only heightened his animal appeal. No soap would jettison such gold and electricityâ€”a figure simultaneously furious, ironic, melancholy, and horny." ...|$|E
500|$|Snyder's {{first cut}} of the film was three hours long. In keeping the film tight, Snyder dubbed himself [...] "the gatekeeper" [...] of the comic's easter eggs, [...] "while [...] conspire to say, 'No. Length, length, length. Playability.' [...] I've lost {{perspective}} on that now, because to me, the honest truth is I geek out on little stuff now as much as anybody. Like, people will go, 'We've got to cut. You don't need that shot of Hollis Mason's garage sign.' And I'm like, 'What are you talking about? Of course you do. Are you crazy? <b>How</b> <b>will</b> people enjoy the movie without shit like that in it?' So it's hard for me." [...] Snyder cut the film down to 162 minutes when he realized {{there was a way}} to further trim the film: removing the murder of Hollis Mason, the first Nite Owl, which [...] "was easy without destroying the movie".|$|E

500|$|VanDerWerff {{said that}} Morrison had [...] "a nice {{moment when he}} underplays the scene where he talks about <b>how</b> <b>Will</b> once {{contemplated}} suicide after getting caught cheating on a test", though while Lynch thought the [...] "idea of the scene was nice", it was [...] "more awkward than meaningful". Slezak called it [...] "the worst moment of the episode", and criticized the [...] "utter lack of context" [...] regarding what else Will might have been going through. Kubicek described it as an [...] "embarrassingly uncomfortable speech", and Will's implicit comparison of cheating on a test to the stresses of teenage homosexuality was [...] "just wrong". VanDerWerff thought that the next part of the sequence had [...] "a smallness, a realness to the scene that's kind of beautiful, really", and that it feels [...] "like they're actual high school kids"; Votta commented that [...] "as the kids admit {{all the things they}} are looking forward to", it reminds viewers why they are [...] "rooting for this ragtag bunch".|$|E

[...] Kaufman noted that Jackson became more forceful during the chorus, when he sang, [...] "You're the one that makes me strong / I can't make it another day / You're the fire that keeps me warm / I can't make it another day." [...] The journalist also noted the lyrical and melodical similarities between [...] "Another Day" [...] and [...] "Storm", which features Kravitz singing, [...] "I walked away but I was wrong / You're the one that keeps me strong / You're the fire that keeps me warm / <b>How</b> <b>will</b> I get through this storm?" ...|$|E

She talks about her Christian faith and remembers her childhood, her first marriage to Charlie Cotton (Christopher Hancock) and her friendship with Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin). She talks about when she was evacuated to Wales during the Second World War and how she did not cry when she left her mother. She says she was happy moving away to live with her guardians, a Welsh couple named Gwen and Will, as they made her feel special, and recalls the happiest day of her life. She remembers <b>how</b> <b>Will</b> would sing [...] "Pretty Baby" [...] to her at night, but says since then everyone she has cared about has died.
