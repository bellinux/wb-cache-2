5|$|Chapman {{had laid}} out a five-year plan for success in 1925, and it came to {{fruition}} <b>exactly</b> <b>on</b> schedule, as his Arsenal won their first major trophy in the 1930 FA Cup Final, beating his old side, Huddersfield Town, 2–0. Despite having only finished 14th in the League the same season, the win spurred Arsenal on and laid the foundations for a decade in which Arsenal would become the dominant team in England and eventually win five league titles.|$|E
5|$|Joachim Roth's {{low-level}} navigation {{had been}} extremely accurate. He had navigated his unit to within two minutes flying {{time from the}} target without interception, over unfamiliar enemy territory, on time and <b>exactly</b> <b>on</b> the planned route. But as the Dorniers neared the airfield they noticed {{that there was no}} smoke, or signs of damage. They expected to be polishing off a damaged fighter station. As the Germans burst over the airfield the air was suddenly filled with tracer rounds as the Dorniers' gunners engaged the Bofors and British AAA defences.|$|E
5|$|The peak {{brightness}} of the μ ring lies almost <b>exactly</b> <b>on</b> the orbit of the small Uranian moon Mab, which is probably {{the source of the}} ring’s particles. The ν ring is positioned between Portia and Rosalind and does not contain any moons inside it. A reanalysis of the Voyager 2 images of forward-scattered light clearly reveals the μ and ν rings. In this geometry the rings are much brighter, which indicates that they contain much micrometer-sized dust. The outer rings of Uranus may be similar to the G and E rings of Saturn as E ring is extremely broad and receives dust from Enceladus.|$|E

5|$|Wind {{is caused}} by {{differences}} in the atmospheric pressure. When a difference in atmospheric pressure exists, air moves from the higher to the lower pressure area, resulting in winds of various speeds. On a rotating planet, air will also be deflected by the Coriolis effect, except <b>exactly</b> <b>on</b> the equator. Globally, the two major driving factors of large-scale wind patterns (the atmospheric circulation) are the differential heating between the equator and the poles (difference in absorption of solar energy leading to buoyancy forces) and {{the rotation of the}} planet. Outside the tropics and aloft from frictional effects of the surface, the large-scale winds tend to approach geostrophic balance. Near the Earth's surface, friction causes the wind to be slower than it would be otherwise. Surface friction also causes winds to blow more inward into low-pressure areas.|$|E
25|$|Round-off errors arise {{because it}} is {{impossible}} to represent all real numbers <b>exactly</b> <b>on</b> a machine with finite memory (which is what all practical digital computers are).|$|E
25|$|Whetstone International Airport or Del Bonita/Whetstone International Airport {{is located}} in Alberta and Montana, and {{similarly}} has an east–west runway sited <b>exactly</b> <b>on</b> the border. It is assigned U.S. identifier H28 and Canadian identifier CEQ4.|$|E

25|$|Coutts/Ross International Airport {{is located}} in Alberta and Montana. Like Coronach/Scobey, the east–west runway is sited <b>exactly</b> <b>on</b> the border. It is owned entirely by the Montana Aeronautics Division. It is {{assigned}} U.S. identifier 7S8 and Canadian identifier CEP4.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, and <b>exactly</b> <b>on</b> Patrizio’s birthday, this eponymous album made it {{to number}} 5 on the US Jazz Billboard charts, and was {{followed}} by his third concert tour, through Australia, New Zealand, Asia, South Africa and the United States, where {{he was invited to}} perform with Larry King and on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.|$|E
25|$|Although Rock Band 3s {{gameplay}} in Basic mode is {{very similar}} to that of previous games in the series, it does introduce a new gameplay mechanic designed to make fast sections such as trills, tremolo picking, and drum rolls easier to play. In such sections, players are rewarded for being <b>exactly</b> <b>on</b> cue, but they are not penalized for small differences.|$|E
25|$|Exteriors of the Dietrichson {{house in}} the film were shot at a , Spanish Colonial Revival house built in 1927. The house can still be seen today and is located at 6301 Quebec Drive in the Beachwood Canyon {{neighborhood}} of Los Angeles. The production team copied {{the interior of the}} house, including the spiral staircase, almost <b>exactly</b> <b>on</b> a soundstage at Paramount.|$|E

25|$|The {{doors of}} the Chapel are opened at 1:30 pm and the public allowed to find their seats. As the service is {{broadcast}} live by BBC Radio 4, {{at the request of}} the BBC it begins a little after 3:00 pm and not <b>exactly</b> <b>on</b> the hour due to an hourly radio news update. It concludes at around 4:30 pm or 4:45 pm at the earliest.|$|E
25|$|An eclipse {{does not}} happen at every new or full moon, because {{the plane of the}} orbit of the Moon around the Earth is tilted with respect to the plane of the orbit of the Earth around the Sun (the ecliptic): so as seen from the Earth, when the Moon is nearest to the Sun (new moon) or at largest {{distance}} (full moon), the three bodies usually are not <b>exactly</b> <b>on</b> the same line.|$|E
25|$|Another oddity was Wollankstraße station. Like Bornholmer Straße, {{it was an}} S-Bahn stop {{served by}} West Berlin trains, but located on East Berlin {{territory}} just behind the border. However, Wollankstraße was in use and accessible for West Berliners, {{as one of its}} exits opened on a West Berlin street. This exit was <b>exactly</b> <b>on</b> the border line, a warning sign next to it informing passengers about the situation. Its other exits to East Berlin streets were blocked.|$|E

50|$|OGLE-LMC-CEP0227 is an {{eclipsing binary}} (Cepheid variable) star, {{pulsating}} every 3.8 days. The star, in the Large Magellanic Cloud, {{was the first}} Cepheid star system found to be orbiting <b>exactly</b> edge <b>on.</b>|$|R
25|$|The South Pole {{sees the}} Sun rise and set {{only once a}} year. Due to {{atmospheric}} refraction, these do not occur <b>exactly</b> <b>on</b> the September equinox and the March equinox, respectively: the Sun is above the horizon for four days longer at each equinox. The place has no solar time; there is no daily maximum or minimum solar height above the horizon. The station uses New Zealand time (UTC+12, UTC+13 during daylight saving time) since all flights to McMurdo station depart from Christchurch and, therefore, all official travel from the pole goes through New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|The town of Opotiki is {{situated}} <b>exactly</b> <b>on</b> latitude 38° South. The climate is temperate. Summer temperatures reach the mid-20s (Celsius, mid-70s Fahrenheit) {{on the coast}} and encourage {{a continuation of the}} beach culture of the Bay of Plenty. Winter days are often cloudless, the daytime temperature never drops below freezing but there may be a mild frost at night. Winter snow falls along the crest of the ranges, and on the higher peaks (over 1000 m) may remain for a few weeks. Rain occurs at any season. Severe localised rainstorms ('cloudbursts') may occur in the high country and have caused flash flooding including past inundations of Opotiki township.|$|E
25|$|The {{geographical}} {{extent of}} the culture is vast and difficult to delineate <b>exactly.</b> <b>On</b> its western fringes, it overlaps with the approximately contemporaneous, but distinct, Srubna culture in the Volga-Ural interfluvial. To the east, it reaches into the Minusinsk depression, with some sites as far west as the southern Ural Mountains, overlapping with {{the area of the}} earlier Afanasevo culture. Additional sites are scattered as far south as the Kopet Dag (Turkmenistan), the Pamir (Tajikistan) and the Tian Shan (Kyrgyzstan). The northern boundary vaguely corresponds {{to the beginning of the}} Taiga. In the Volga basin, interaction with the Srubna culture was the most intense and prolonged, and Federovo style pottery is found as far west as Volgograd.|$|E
