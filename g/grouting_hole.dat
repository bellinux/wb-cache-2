During the subsurface investigation a seven foot air-filled void was encountered in the bedrock within the building footprint. Electrical Resistivity Imaging (ERI) was conducted {{in an attempt to}} determine the lateral extent of the encountered void and to establish the general prevalence of karst features at the site. Due to uncertainty in the subsurface conditions, a rock treatment and soil modification program was developed which consisted of a series of targeted exploratory <b>grout</b> <b>holes</b> advanced in 126 locations in the structural areas of the building footprint. The intent of the program was not to prevent the development of a soil dropout, but to improve the foundation support of the structure so that the facility would perform acceptably if a future soil dropout were to occur during the design life of the facility. This was achieved by targeting each footing with 3 exploratory <b>grout</b> <b>holes.</b> The intent of each grout injection was 1) to identify the top of rock elevation, 2) determine if a karst feature existed, 3) cap the karst bedrock below the footing and treat defects in the rock, and 4) provide localized improvement of soft soils through the use of low mobility grout columns under each footing. Drilling refusal elevations were obtained for every <b>grout</b> <b>hole</b> and were assumed to represent the top of bedrock. Each exploratory hole was closely monitored for pressure and volume in 0. 61 meter (2 -foot) stages.

Several quality control measures were undertaken prior to quality assurance testing. Two measurements of spoil return and spoil flow rate for each column were implemented.

In addition, a control chart with upper and lower control limits, established from a large dataset of flow rate of spoil return, was a means to recognize the likelihood of sand boiling and to serve as an early warning indicator of abnormal conditions for the jet grouting works below the groundwater table. As the mean spoil density of the infill column was larger than perimeter column, an optimal grouting sequence for clusters was suggested in this paper.

Main mechanical affections occur at the lateral zone, and the maximal stress occurs at the lateral end of the pipe. With the increase of cross direction load, the maximal stress increases and exceeds the strength of material, and the pipe is pulled out. The influencing factors of bearing capacity of the steel foot pipe were studied. Some important results different from engineering experiences are as following: 1) to steel foot pipe that can not penetrate the soft base, its reasonable dip angle is very small for its low longitudinal bearing capacity; 2) steel pipe with diameter of 42 mm is unsuitable for foot steel pipe because its low cross bearing capacity; 3) to a given geological condition and pipe parameter, the reasonable length of steel pipe is certain, extra longer pipes can’t obtain larger capacity; 4) surrounding rock near the support structure should be especially reinforced by drilling <b>grouting</b> <b>holes</b> along the whole steel pipe.
