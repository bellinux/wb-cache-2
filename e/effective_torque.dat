5000|$|As {{the output}} of an impact wrench, when hammering, is a very short impact force, the actual <b>effective</b> <b>torque</b> is {{difficult}} to measure, with several different ratings in use. As the tool delivers a fixed amount of energy with each blow, rather than a fixed torque, the actual output torque changes with {{the duration of the}} output pulse. If the output is springy or capable of absorbing energy, the impulse will simply be absorbed, and virtually no torque will ever be applied, and somewhat counter-intuitively, if the object is very springy, the wrench may actually turn backwards as the energy is delivered back to the anvil, while it is not connected to the hammer and able to spin freely. [...] A wrench that is capable of freeing a rusted nut on a very large bolt may be incapable of turning a small screw mounted on a spring. [...] "Maximum torque" [...] is the number most often given by manufacturers, which is the instantaneous peak torque delivered if the anvil is locked into a perfectly solid object. [...] "Working torque" [...] is a more realistic number for continually driving a very stiff fastener. [...] "Nut-busting torque" [...] is often quoted, with the usual definition being that the wrench can loosen a nut tightened with the specified amount of torque in some specified time period. Accurately controlling the output torque of an impact wrench is very difficult, and even an experienced operator will have a hard time making sure a fastener is not undertightened or overtightened using an impact wrench. Special socket extensions are available, which take advantage of the inability of an impact wrench to work against a spring, to precisely limit the output torque. Designed with spring steel, they act as large torsion springs, flexing at their torque rating, and preventing any further torque from being applied to the fastener. Some impact wrenches designed for product assembly have a built-in torque control system, such as a built-in torsion spring and a mechanism that shuts the tool down when the given torque is exceeded. When very precise torque is required, an impact wrench is only used to snug down the fastener, with a torque wrench used for the final tightening. Due to the lack of standards when measuring the maximum torque, some manufacturers are believed to inflate their ratings, or to use measurements with little bearing on how the tool will perform in actual use. Many air impact wrenches incorporate a flow regulator into their design, either as a separate control or part of the reversing valve, allowing torque to be roughly limited in one or both directions, while electric tools may use a variable speed trigger for the same effect.|$|E

The method is developed by IAV GmbH, Fraunhofer-Institut and Audi AG. The determination of the indicated torque is based on high resolution engine speed measurements.

40|$|We {{present results}} from the first fully general relativistic, {{magnetohydrodynamic}} (GRMHD) simulations of an equal-mass black hole binary (BHBH) in a magnetized, circumbinary accretion disk. We simulate both the pre and post-decoupling phases of a BHBH-disk system and both "cooling" and "no-cooling" gas flows. Prior to decoupling, the competition between the binary tidal <b>torques</b> and the <b>effective</b> viscous <b>torques</b> due to MHD turbulence depletes the disk interior to the binary orbit. However, it also induces a two-stream accretion flow and mildly relativistic polar outflows from the BHs. Following decoupling, but before gas fills the low-density "hollow" surrounding the remnant, the accretion rate is reduced, {{while there is a}} prompt electromagnetic (EM) luminosity enhancement following merger due to shock heating and accretion onto the spinning BH remnant. This investigation, though preliminary, previews more detailed GRMHD simulations we plan to perform in anticipation of future, simultaneous detections of gravitational and EM radiation from a merging BHBH-disk system.

30|$|Several {{considerations}} {{should be}} taken into account, when interpreting the results of this study. As the scope was to investigate the net <b>effective</b> <b>torque</b> on the tooth and the surrounding structures, full wire-bracket engagement was modeled with idealized bracket and wire dimensions. In reality, smaller wire dimensions, the use of a 0.022 -in. bracket system, or the reported dimensional inaccuracy of wires and brackets [2, 38] would most likely introduce additional wire play [21] and thereby decrease <b>effective</b> <b>torque</b> application. The values reported in this study correspond to the moment or root movement variants in cases of play minimization by the use of terminal sized or excessively torqued archwires, which should counteract the play and care should be exercised in transferring the results of this investigation to the clinical situation. Furthermore, the present study assesses relative contributions of various factors to the initial force system applied singularly to an upper central incisor, which might not directly reflect clinical scenarios with full archwire engagement. To reduce the number of equations to be solved, the teeth were not differentiated into enamel, dentine, pulp, and cementum but were provided uniformly with the elasticity parameters of dentine. In view of the minor forces applied, the influence of this simplification is negligible because no substantial deformation of the dental hard tissue was to be expected. For the same reason, the bone was not differentiated into cancellous and cortical bone, while no nickel-titanium wire was modeled, due to its complex mechanical properties. Finally, future studies on this research field should assess the effect of different biomechanical strategies of torque application with the risk and extent of root resorption.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To verify whether {{en masse}} {{retraction}} or two-step retraction could provide more <b>effective</b> <b>torque</b> {{control of the}} anterior teeth when varying the degree of gable bend in loop mechanics. Materials and methods: The forces and moments delivered by 10. mm high teardrop loops with gable bends of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 ° were calculated by the tangent stiffness method and applied to three-dimensional (3 D) finite element (FE) models. FE models simulating en masse retraction and two-step retraction were constructed separately. The movement patterns of the maxillary central incisor, namely the degree of lingual crown tipping {{and the location of}} the center of rotation (CRo), were analyzed. Results: The moment to force (M/F) ratio generated by activation of closing loops increased as the degree of gable bend was increased from 0 to 30 °. The degree of lingual crown tipping increased in en masse retraction, whereas it decreased in two-step retraction as the degree of gable bend was increased. Although the location of the CRo remained almost at the same position in en masse retraction, it moved apically in two-step retraction when increasing the degree of gable bend. Conclusion: Incorporation of gable bends into closing loops would provide <b>effective</b> <b>torque</b> control of the anterior tooth in two-step retraction. Conversely, it is considered that the movement patterns of anterior teeth are hardly influenced by gable bends placed into loops in en masse retraction. 長崎大学学位論文 学位記番号:博(医歯薬) 甲第 771 号 学位授与年月日:平成 27 年 3 月 20 日Author: Pao-Chang Chiang, Yoshiyuki Koga, Jun-ya Tominaga, Hiroya Ozaki, Ryo Hamanaka, Mayumi Sumi, Noriaki YoshidaCitation: Orthodontic Waves, 74 (3), pp. 55 - 61; 2015 - 0...|$|E

The thinnest Ta underlayer is amorphous, whereas for thicker Ta layers a disoriented tetragonal beta-phase appears. <b>Effective</b> spin-orbit <b>torques</b> are calculated based on harmonic Hall voltage measurements performed in a temperature range between 15 and 300 K.

Based on this approach, the temperature dependence of the spin Hall angle in the Ta underlayer and at Ta/CoFeB interface are determined separately.
