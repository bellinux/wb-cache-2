5|$|I {{loved the}} Spitfire {{in all of}} her many versions. But I {{have to admit that}} the later marks, {{although}} they were faster than the earlier ones, were also much <b>heavier</b> <b>and</b> so did not handle so well. You did not have such positive control over them. One test of manoeuvrability was to throw her into a flick-roll and see how many times she rolled. With the Mark II or the Mark V one got two-and-a-half flick-rolls but the Mark IX was <b>heavier</b> <b>and</b> you got only one-and-a-half. With the later and still heavier versions, one got even less. The essence of aircraft design is compromise, and an improvement {{at one end of the}} performance envelope is rarely achieved without a deterioration somewhere else.|$|E
5|$|Maintenance {{remained}} mostly manual {{until the}} 1960s, after which a major rationalization plan shifted this work to machines. This allowed the line's standard to increase, allowing for <b>heavier</b> <b>and</b> faster trains. Hegra, Sona and Flornes Stations were made unmanned in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Ski {{boots are}} {{attached}} to the ski only at the toe, leaving the heel free. Depending on application, boots may be lightweight (performance skiing) or <b>heavier</b> <b>and</b> more supportive (back-country skiing).|$|E

40|$|Cross-sectionally, {{social norms}} {{are related to}} <b>heavy</b> <b>and</b> problem {{drinking}} in late adolescence. A better understanding is needed regarding the longitudinal associations between social norms in younger populations <b>and</b> <b>heavy</b> <b>and</b> problem drinking over time. This study distinguished between descriptive (proximal reference group) and injunctive norms (proximal and distal reference groups). This study evaluated the perception of social norms in youngsters during early adolescence (13 - 15 years) and the contribution of these norms to <b>heavy</b> <b>and</b> problem drinking over a 4 -year period. Adolescents (N = 428; 205 boys) participated in a prospective study with 5 annual waves. Regression {{analyses were conducted to}} examine whether descriptive and injunctive norms prospectively predict <b>heavy</b> <b>and</b> problem drinking. Descriptive and injunctive norms of the proximal, but not the distal reference group, predicted heavy drinking in late adolescence. Descriptive norms of the proximal reference group also predicted problem drinking in late adolescence. This study demonstrates the role of social norms in the prediction of <b>heavy</b> <b>and</b> problem drinking over time. Additionally, it illustrates the contribution of proximal rather than distal reference peers to <b>heavy</b> <b>and</b> problem drinking in late adolescence, and it suggests the relevance of targeting these norms in prevention research.

5|$|After his {{appointment}} as project director {{for a new}} indigenous fighter program, Tank adapted the basic Ta 183 airframe for the Nene II engine, substantially resulting in a new design that bore only a passing resemblance to its forebear. The Nene was larger, <b>heavier</b> <b>and</b> {{more powerful than the}} Heinkel HeS 011 turbojet that had been planned for use in the Ta 183, and therefore required a new, redesigned fuselage with a larger cross-section primarily due to the Nene's centrifugal rather than the HeS 011's axial compressor design.|$|E
5|$|Back country skis: Designed for ski touring {{on natural}} snow conditions. Recommended lengths are between 150 and 195 centimeters for adult skiers, {{depending}} on {{height and weight}} of the user. Back country skis are typically <b>heavier</b> <b>and</b> wider than classic and skate skis; they often have metal edges for better grip on hard snow; and their greater sidecut helps to carve turns.|$|E
5|$|By 1893, the NYLE {{had gone}} {{bankrupt}} and was {{merged with the}} Erie Railroad, which became {{the owner of the}} bridge. By the start of the 20thcentury, locomotives were almost 85percent <b>heavier,</b> <b>and</b> the iron bridge could no longer safely carry trains. The last traffic crossed the old bridge on May 14, 1900, and removal of the old iron began on May 24.|$|E

5|$|Dalton also {{believed}} atomic theory {{could explain why}} water absorbs different gases in different proportions. For example, he found that water absorbs carbon dioxide far better than it absorbs nitrogen. Dalton hypothesized {{this was due to}} the differences between the masses and configurations of the gases' respective particles, and carbon dioxide molecules (CO2) are <b>heavier</b> <b>and</b> larger than nitrogen molecules (N2).|$|E
5|$|In {{recording}} Revelation, Third Day {{aimed to}} produce a southern rock album while being more creative musically; the band felt the end result was their best record to date. As a whole, the album is noted as adopting a <b>heavier</b> <b>and</b> edgier rock sound than Third Day's previous adult contemporary-projects such as Wherever You Are (2005), while the album's lyrics reflect Christian themes. The album features guest appearances from Chris Daughtry, Lacey Mosley of alternative metal band Flyleaf, and pedal steel guitarist Robert Randolph.|$|E
5|$|The SS90 was {{an early}} {{prototype}} round used only in the earliest examples of the P90. It used a lightweight 1.5-g (23grain) {{full metal jacket bullet}} with a polymer core, which it propelled at a muzzle velocity of roughly 850m/s (2,800ft/s). The SS90 was abandoned in 1994 in favor of the <b>heavier</b> <b>and</b> shorter 2.7 mm (0.11in) SS190 projectile.|$|E

5|$|The {{common loon}} is {{distinguished}} from the black-throated loon (G. arctica) and the red-throated loon (G. stellata) mainly by its larger size. It usually has a steeper forehead and a bulging forecrown, somewhat similar to the black-throated loon. Its bill is <b>heavier</b> <b>and</b> the back is paler than its hindneck. It {{is more difficult to}} separate from the yellow-billed loon, but its breeding plumage has more white markings on the neck and the squares on its shoulders are usually smaller; the non-breeding plumage has darker neck-sides contrasting more sharply with pale areas and bill colour.|$|E
5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} differs greatly from the nilgai in colour, {{is much smaller}} and has an extra pair of horns. The nilgai is nearly nine times <b>heavier</b> <b>and</b> two times taller than the {{four-horned antelope}}. Two deer species, the Indian muntjac and the hog deer, can be confused with this antelope. The four-horned antelope, however, lacks their antlers. The chinkara, a gazelle, can be told apart by its light brown coat and larger, ringed horns.|$|E
5|$|The {{rebuilding}} solved most of {{the maintenance}} problems whilst retaining the excellent features of the original design. Repair costs were reduced by up to 60%, and coal consumption was reduced by up to 8.4%. However the Walschaerts valve gear made the rebuilds <b>heavier</b> <b>and</b> prone to hammerblow on the track, a complaint that was not evident with the original design. The increased weight reduced their route availability, meaning {{that they could not}} be used on certain routes available to un-rebuilt examples, such as the line to Ilfracombe.|$|E

5|$|While the jaguar {{closely resembles}} the leopard, it is {{sturdier}} and <b>heavier,</b> <b>and</b> the two animals {{can be distinguished}} by their rosettes: the rosettes on a jaguar's coat are larger, fewer in number, usually darker, and have thicker lines and small spots in the middle that the leopard lacks. Jaguars also have rounder heads and shorter, stockier limbs compared to leopards.|$|E
5|$|Although both colour morphs {{occur in}} much of the European range, brown birds predominate in the more humid climate of western Europe, with the grey phase {{becoming}} more common further east; in the northernmost regions, all the owls are a cold-grey colour. Siberian and Central Asian subspecies have grey and white plumage, the North African race is dark grey-brown, and South and East Asian birds have barred, not striped, underparts, and fine lines around the facial disc. The Siberian and Scandinavian subspecies are 12% larger and 40% <b>heavier,</b> <b>and</b> have 13% longer wings than western European birds, in accordance with Bergmann's rule which predicts that northern forms will typically be bigger than their southern counterparts.|$|E
5|$|American Tragedy is {{the second}} studio album by American rap rock band Hollywood Undead. Production for the album began {{following}} the induction of Daniel Murillo into the band in early 2010 and lasted until December. Don Gilmore and Ben Grosse, who helped produce the band's debut album, Swan Songs (2008), also returned to produce the album along with several other producers including Kevin Rudolf, Sam Hollander, Dave Katz, Griffin Boice, Jeff Halavacs, and Jacob Kasher. The album is musically <b>heavier</b> <b>and</b> features darker lyrical content than the band's previous effort. Originally set to release in March, American Tragedy was released on April5, 2011 in the United States and was released on various other dates that month in other countries. A remix of the album, American Tragedy Redux, was released on November 21, 2011.|$|E

5|$|Herodotus {{suggests}} that the Allied ships were <b>heavier</b> <b>and,</b> by implication, less maneuverable. Their weight would further {{reduce the likelihood of}} the Allied ships employing the diekplous. The source of this heaviness is uncertain; possibly the Allied ships were bulkier in construction. Another suggestion is that the heaviness was caused by the weight of fully armoured hoplite marines. The Allies may have had extra marines on board if their ships were less maneuverable, since boarding would then be the main tactic available to them (at the cost of making the ships even heavier). Indeed, Herodotus refers to the Greeks capturing ships, rather than sinking them.|$|E
5|$|Norwegian Forest cats have a {{quiet voice}} but can develop a loud voice if kept {{in a house with}} a dog. They are friendly, intelligent, and {{generally}} good with people. The Norwegian Forest cat has a lot of energy and can be very demanding of attention. Those cats that live primarily outdoors become swift and effective hunters, but the breed can also adapt to indoor life. If bought from a registered breeder in the USA, they tend to cost from $550 to $800. The cats usually live to be 14 to 16 years old. As they are heavy-boned and tall, they require more food than most other domestic breeds. Males are considerably <b>heavier</b> <b>and</b> larger-boned than females.|$|E
5|$|The 18th {{century was}} indeed {{the golden age of}} the chair, {{especially}} in France and England (including Colonial America), between which there was considerable give and take of ideas. Even Diderot could not refrain from writing of them in his Encyclopédie. The typical Louis Seize chair, oval-backed and ample of seat, with descending arms and round-reeded legs, covered in Beauvais or some such gay tapestry woven with Boucher or Watteau-like scenes, is a very gracious object, in which the period reached its high-water mark. The Empire brought in squat and squabby shapes, comfortable enough no doubt, but entirely destitute of inspiration. English Empire chairs were often <b>heavier</b> <b>and</b> more sombre than those of French design.|$|E
