40|$|Slipper's micro motions {{including}} the squeezing motion, spinning motion, and tilting motion {{have a significant}} impact on its lubricating condition and dynamic behavior. However, few experimental studies are on these micro motions within a real axial piston pump, especially the slipper's spinning motion. The experimental investigations on the slipper in the past mainly focused on the parameters of the oil film such as pressure, thickness, and temperature. The sensors were often installed in the fixed swash plate when the cylinder block was chosen to rotate. Alternatively, the sensors were mounted in the fixed modified slipper when the swash plate rotated. The biggest challenge of the direct measurements of these micro motions is the space limitation for the sensor installation due to the compact structure of axial piston pumps as well as the slipper's macro motion. This paper presents a new three-piston pump for the slipper test rig which can provide enough installation space for the sensor. To realize the cylinder block balance, a <b>hold-down</b> <b>plate</b> is first introduced into this three-piston pump. In addition, a detailed set of relevant equations is derived to evaluate the functionality of the <b>hold-down</b> <b>plate.</b> Finally, the slipper's spinning motion was measured directly and continuously using this three-piston pump, which confirmed the capability of the slipper test rig...|$|E
40|$|The {{transfer}} of solute from a concentrated gas stream causes significant decreases in the flowrate and pressure. In this work, we develop dynamic models for tray and packed absorbers that predict the transient flowrate and pressure during concentrated absorption. The models have separate material balances for each phase and are non-isothermal, account for solvent evaporation, and predict transient hydraulic behavior. We study the aqueous absorption of gaseous HCl and NH 3. ^ The equilibrium sieve-tray model predicts large decreases {{in the gas}} flowrate during startup which triggers excessive transient weeping. Steady-state weeping is suppressed by solvent evaporation in adiabatic columns with hot liquid feed, but manifests in colder columns. Using two half-steps in succession instead of one large concentration step reduces transient weeping. ^ During the transition to standby operation, the influx of inert gas causes solute desorption and solvent evaporation which result in large spikes in the gas flowrates and pressure. Switching from pure HCl to pure N 2 results in a peak exit gas flowrate that is five times the inlet flowrate, causing excessive entrainment. Peak solute loss in the vent gas is five times the acceptable limit. Decreasing the inert flowrate after the step improves transient behavior. ^ The non-equilibrium packed absorber model also predicts large decreases in the gas flowrate during startup for both random and structured packing. However, packed columns are stable at low flowrates and do not weep or dump liquid like tray columns, and therefore, perform better at startup. ^ The model predicts solute accumulation in the bulk gas and delayed solvent evaporation during startup, causing a small spike in the gas compositions. At low mass-transfer rates, the spike causes excessive solute losses in the vent. ^ During the transition to standby operation, the peak gas flowrates are 3 – 5 times the feed gas rate, and the peak pressure drops are 20 – 30 times the flooding values. The spikes are brief and may not cause flooding, but mechanical damage is possible and <b>hold-down</b> <b>plates</b> are recommended. Colder columns may fail due to a large solute spike in the vent gas. Smaller steps in the inert gas flowrate greatly improve transient behavior. ...|$|R
40|$|A timber {{building}} made of cross-laminated timber (CLT) panels is a {{modular system}} where all panels are pre-cut in factory. On site, the single components are then assembled connecting the panels with mechanical fasteners, mainly angle brackets with nails and/or screws, <b>hold-downs,</b> metal <b>plates</b> and self-tapping screws. CLT wall panels are very rigid {{in comparison to}} its connections. Thus, connections play {{an essential role in}} maintaining the integrity of the structure providing the necessary strength, stiffness and ductility, and consequently, they need close attention by designers. However, there is still a lack of proper design rules for these connections, in particular under cyclic loads, mainly due to a large variety of connectors and connection systems. In this paper, the different properties of connections for CLT buildings, on both monotonic and cyclic behaviour, are described using recent works from different authors. From the bibliography, it is clear that experimental data, regarding both monotonic and cyclic tests, is required for the assessment of the performance of the CLT structural system attending to the interaction between rigid panels and connections. This work evidences results from experimental campaigns and numerical analysis regarding definition and quantification of the cyclic response of CLT connections. Examples regarding monotonic and cyclic tests aimed to evaluate cyclic behaviour of connections through physical parameters, such as the impairment of strength and the damping ratio, are presented and discussed.
