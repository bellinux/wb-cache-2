In fact, even for a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>solid</b> sphere, the exact calculation is by no means trivial. Finally note that the calculation can also be performed by assuming a continuum approximation for the neutron transport. This reduces it to a diffusion problem.

50|$|The creep {{properties}} of ODS steels are {{highly dependent on}} the characteristics of the nano-oxides particles which exist in the metal matrix, specifically the ability of these particles to prevent dislocation motion as well as the size and distribution of the particles. Hoelzer and coworkers have shown that an alloy containing a homogeneous dispersion of 1-5 nm Y2Ti2O7 nanoclusters has superior {{creep properties}} to an alloy with a heterogeneous dispersion of 5-20 nm nanoclusters of the same composition. In the pursuit of new ODS steels it is important to focus on processes that allow for the formation of a dense homogeneous dispersion of small nanoclusters. ODS steels are commonly produced through ball-milling an oxide of interest (e.g. Y2O3, Al2O3) with pre-alloyed metal powders followed by compression and sintering of the material. It is believed that the nano-oxides enter into solid solution with the metal during ball-milling and subsequently precipitate during the thermal treatment to yield the ODS steel. This process seems simple but many parameters need to be carefully controlled to produce a well made alloy. Work by Leseigneur and coworkers has been done to carefully control some of these parameters in order to get more consistent and better microstructures in ODS steels. In this two step method the oxide is ball-milled {{for longer periods of time}} to ensure a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>solid</b> solution of the oxide in the metal matrix. Then the powder is annealed at higher temperatures to begin a controlled nucleation of the nano-oxide clusters. Finally the powder is again compressed and sintered to yield the final material.|$|E

Three different values of strain rates have been taken into consideration. Experimentally obtained hardening curves are presented in suitable diagrams.

Additionally, numerical modeling of studied phenomena, using the viscoplastic Chaboche’s model, identified on the basis of experimental data, is presented.

40|$|Hollow {{particles}} with porous shells {{have been}} prepared by a simple modification to the surfactant-free polymerisation of styrene by the incorporation of water-soluble natural polymers {{and the use of}} high stirring speeds. The particle morphology has been characterised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). When styrene is polymerised in the presence of either carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) or sodium alginate at high stirring speeds, small <b>homogeneous</b> (<b>solid)</b> particles (diameter ~ 200 nm) and large porous particles (diameter~ 10 m) are both formed. However, at low stirring speeds only the small <b>homogeneous</b> (<b>solid)</b> particles are formed. Further, only the small <b>homogeneous</b> (<b>solid)</b> particles are formed when non-adsorbing polymers such as starch and poly(vinyl alcohol) are present. In contrast, polymers that strongly adsorb onto polystyrene particles cause the polymerising mixture to flocculate. It is proposed that the porous character {{is a direct result of}} the polymerisation of a multiple emulsion in the presence of a depletion interaction. Moreover, addition of a high concentration of surfactant to the CMC system simply results in the spherical homogenous particles, suggesting that the surfactant removes the depletion effect...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the Discontinuous Cell Method (DCM) is {{formulated}} {{with the}} objective of simulating cohesive fracture propagation and fragmentation in <b>homogeneous</b> <b>solids</b> without issues relevant to excessive mesh deformation typical of available Finite Element formulations. DCM discretizes solids by using the Delaunay triangulation and its associated Voronoi tessellation giving rise to a system of discrete cells interacting through shared facets. For each Voronoi cell, the displacement field is approximated on the basis of rigid body kinematics, which is used to compute a strain vector at the centroid of the Voronoi facets. Such strain vector is demonstrated to be the projection of the strain tensor at that location. At the same point stress tractions are computed through vectorial constitutive equations derived on the basis of classical continuum tensorial theories. Results of analysis of a cantilever beam are used to perform convergence studies and comparison with classical finite element formulations in the elastic regime. Furthermore, cohesive fracture and fragmentation of <b>homogeneous</b> <b>solids</b> are studied under quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions. The mesh dependency problem, typically encountered upon adopting softening constitutive equations, is tackled through the crack band approach. This study demonstrates the capabilities of DCM by solving multiple benchmark problems relevant to cohesive crack propagation. The simulations show that DCM can handle effectively a wide range of problems from the simulation of a single propagating fracture to crack branching and fragmentation...|$|R
