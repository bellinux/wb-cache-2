5|$|X. bracteatum and its {{relatives}} {{belong to}} the Gnaphalieae or paper daisies, a large tribe within the <b>daisy</b> <b>family,</b> Asteraceae. However, a 2002 molecular study of the Gnaphalieae has indicated the genus Xerochrysum is probably polyphyletic, as the two species sampled, X.bracteatum and X.viscosum, were not closely related to each other. X. bracteatum has been recorded hybridising with X.viscosum and X.papillosum in cultivation, and possibly also Coronidium elatum and C.boormanii.|$|E

25|$|Scolymus is a genus of annual, {{biennial}} or perennial, herbaceous {{plants that}} {{is assigned to}} the <b>Daisy</b> <b>family,</b> {{and can be found}} in Macaronesia, around the Mediterranean, and in the Middle East. All species are spiny, thistle-like in appearance, with flowerheads that consist of yellow (rarely orange or white) ligulate florets, and canals that contain latex. It is known as سكوليمس (skwlyms) in Arab, scolyme in French, and is sometimes called golden thistle or oyster thistle in English.|$|E
25|$|Senecio squalidus, {{known as}} Oxford ragwort, is a {{flowering}} {{plant in the}} <b>daisy</b> <b>family</b> Asteraceae. It is a yellow-flowered herbaceous plant, native to mountainous, rocky or volcanic areas, that has managed to find other homes on man-made and natural piles of rocks, war-ruined neighborhoods and even on stone walls. These habitats resemble its well drained natural rocky homeland. The plants have spread via the wind, rail and the activities of botanists. The travels and discriminative tendencies regarding propagation of this short-lived perennial, biennial, or winter annual make it a good subject for studies of the evolution and ecology of flowering plants.|$|E

25|$|Gundelia {{is a low}} to high (20–100cm) thistle-like {{perennial}} {{herbaceous plant}} with latex, spiny compound inflorescences, reminiscent of teasles and eryngos, that contain cream, yellow, greenish, pink, purple or redish-purple disk florets. It is assigned to the <b>daisy</b> <b>family.</b> Flowers can be found from February to May. The stems of this plant dry-out when the seeds are ripe and break free from the underground root, and are then blown away like a tumbleweed, thus spreading the seeds effectively over large areas with little standing vegetation. This plant is native to the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle-East. Opinions differ {{about the number of}} species in Gundelia. Sometimes the genus is regarded monotypic, Gundelia tournefortii being a species with a large variability, but other authors distinguish up to nine species, differing in floret color and pubescence. Young stems are cooked and eaten in the Middle-East and are said to taste like a combination of artichoke and asparagus. The plant also contains compounds that have been demonstrated to be effective against a range of ailments. A large quantity of pollen assigned to Gundelia has been found on the Shroud of Turin, which may suggest that the crown of thorns was made from Gundelia, but this finding has been contested.|$|E

50|$|The species {{appears in}} a wide range of colours from red-brown, {{yellow-brown}} to purple. Yellow specimens are also not uncommon and it is this extreme variability that makes identification on the basis of size or colour uncertain.It is parasitic on various members of the pea (Fabaceae) and <b>daisy</b> (Asteraceae) <b>families.</b> Although widespread, its appearance is sporadic; despite this, it can occur in vast colonies from time to time. The main flowering season in the northern hemisphere is from May until the end of August and from August to January in the southern hemisphere. The species has efficient seed dispersal and is largely inbreeding so that populations preferentially parasitizing a particular species which has its own clear ecological preferences may become effectively isolated and eventually may produce distinct taxa.|$|R
