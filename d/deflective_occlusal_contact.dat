40|$|OBJECTIVE: Define {{and compare}} numbers {{and types of}} <b>occlusal</b> <b>contacts</b> in maximum intercuspation. METHODS: The study {{consisted}} of clinical and photographic analysis of <b>occlusal</b> <b>contacts</b> in maximum intercuspation. Twenty-six Caucasian Brazilian subjects were selected before orthodontic treatment, 20 males and 6 females, with ages ranging between 12 and 18 years. The subjects were diagnosed and grouped as follows: 13 with Angle Class I malocclusion and 13 with Angle Class II Division 1 malocclusion. After analysis, the <b>occlusal</b> <b>contacts</b> were classified according to the established criteria as: tripodism, bipodism, monopodism (respectively, three, two or one contact point with {{the slope of the}} fossa); cuspid to a marginal ridge; cuspid to two marginal ridges; cuspid tip to opposite inclined plane; surface to surface; and edge to edge. RESULTS: The mean number of <b>occlusal</b> <b>contacts</b> per subject in Class I malocclusion was 43. 38 and for Class II Division 1 malocclusion it was 44. 38, this difference was not statistically significant (p> 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: There is a variety of factors that influence the number of <b>occlusal</b> <b>contacts</b> between a Class I and a Class II, Division 1 malocclusion. There is no standardization of <b>occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> type according to the studied malocclusions. A proper selection of <b>occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> types such as cuspid to fossa or cuspid to marginal ridge and its location in the teeth should be individually defined according to the demands of each case.

30|$|<b>Occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> is a {{reflection}} of the degree of functional recovery and measurement of factors such as number of <b>occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> points, contact area, and distribution.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the <b>occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> of single implant superstructures at the mandibular first molar immediately after seating by using two different materials with an electromyogram. Ultimately, we aimed to obtain clinical suggestions for the occlusion that should be given to prosthetic implants through a longitudinal follow-up study.|$|R
30|$|In this study, we {{measured}} <b>occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> and maximum bite during a 3 -month follow-up period {{in patients with}} implant-supported prostheses.

30|$|The {{results of}} this study suggest that in cases where at least 3  years have passed {{following}} mandibular free-end edentulous implant treatment, there is a relationship between the implant <b>occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> size and periodontal mechanosensitive threshold of adjacent premolars. In our study, a smaller <b>occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> area resulted in increased thresholds. This suggests that the amount of <b>occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> area allocated around the implant region should be considered for long-term maintenance of oromandibular function, including the preservation of adjacent teeth.|$|R
30|$|<b>Occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> {{state is}} thought to be {{affected}} by the intensity of tooth clenching and it has been stipulated that it is optimal to measure muscular activity using electromyography (Mukai et al. 2011). However, in this study, <b>occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> area was studied not as a comparison between subjects, but as a ratio between the <b>occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> areas of the implant and adjacent premolars in each subject. Therefore, the tooth-clenching intensity was set at “strong clenching” and the magnitude was left to the perception of the subjects.|$|R
30|$|<b>Occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> {{area was}} {{measured}} by registering a check-bite in the intercuspal position using silicone impression materials (Blue Silicone®; GC, Tokyo, Japan).

The Bite Eye is considered to have extremely high reproducibility for repeated measurements (Uchida et al. 2014).

30|$|Based on the {{periodontal}} mechanosensitive threshold, {{the subjects}} {{were divided into two}} groups: normal and high. Periodontal membrane tactile and pressure sensitivity thresholds were set at ≤ 5  g for the normal group and ≥ 5.1  g for the high group, based on Mukai et al. (2011) reported that interquartile range of periodontal mechanosensitive threshold of mandibular premolar teeth of adult with natural dentition was less than 5  g. Clinically, {{there is a tendency to}} apply a smaller amount of <b>occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> area to implants than that found in the remaining teeth (Misch and Bidez 1994). However, in the dentition of healthy-toothed individuals, <b>occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> area of distal natural teeth tends to be large (Araki et al. 1997). Therefore, in this study, we divided subjects into two groups based on implant <b>occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> area: a small contact group, wherein implant <b>occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> area was less than half that of the adjacent premolars, and a large contact group, wherein implant <b>occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> area was at least half that of the adjacent premolars.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} was to characterise the patterns and forces of <b>occlusal</b> <b>contacts</b> during lateral mandibular excursions in a young Chinese adult population. Angle Class I normal occlusions in 85 dental students aged 20 – 29 were evaluated using the T-Scan II occlusal imaging and analysis system. The frequency of <b>occlusal</b> <b>contacts</b> was recorded for right and left lateral excursions at the position of lateral disclusion, at the canine-to-canine position and at the lateral maximal position. At the canine-to-canine position, the <b>occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> patterns were classified, and the relative forces were compared by multiple regression analysis, with α = 0 · 05. At the position of lateral disclusion, {{a high percentage of}} canine contacts (58 · 5 %) and individual posterior tooth contacts on the working side was observed. At the canine-to-canine position, the canines on the working side contacted most frequently (68 · 9 %), and the <b>occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> patterns could be classified into six groups. At the lateral maximal position, incisors (39 · 0 %) and canines (32 · 3 %) contacted most frequently. At the canine-to-canine position, subjects with <b>occlusal</b> <b>contacts</b> only on canines or on first premolars on the working side had the lowest relative occlusal forces (P < 0 · 001).

30|$|Dental Prescale has a {{thickness}} of approximately 100  μm, whereas Blue Silicone has less thickness {{and is therefore}} likely to give more accurate measurements of the <b>occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> area [12, 23]. In addition, when the <b>occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> areas of implant prostheses and their contralateral teeth were compared, the <b>occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> area of the contralateral teeth was significantly greater at higher clenching strength. This is probably because occlusion between natural teeth results in greater displacement due {{to the presence of}} a periodontal membrane on both teeth. In addition, Koyama et al. [10] reported {{no significant differences between the}} molar region on the implant side and on the contralateral side, even when clenching strength varied. Similarly, when clenching strength varied in this study, the <b>occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> area of the implant prosthesis did not increase than the contralateral tooth.|$|R

30|$|The molars {{directly}} receive mechanical stimulation during mastication, and molar occlusal {{state and}} occlusal force are {{strongly related to}} occlusal support.

Therefore, this study investigated the effect of <b>occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> size of implants on the periodontal mechanosensitive threshold of adjacent premolars. A cross-sectional study design was adopted. The Department of Oral Implantology, Osaka Dental University, was the setting where patients underwent implant treatment in the mandibular free-end edentulous area. The study population comprised of 87 patients (109 teeth) who underwent follow-up observation for at least 3  years following implant superstructure placement. As variables, age, sex, duration following superstructure placement, presence or absence of dental pulp, <b>occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> area, and periodontal mechanosensitive threshold were considered. The <b>occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> area was measured using Blue Silicone®and Bite Eye BE-I®. Periodontal mechanosensitive threshold were measured using von Frey hair. As quantitative variables for periodontal mechanosensitive threshold, we divided subjects into two groups: normal (≤ 5  g) and high (≥ 5.1  g). For statistical analysis, we compared the two groups for the sensation thresholds using the Chi square test for categorical data and the Mann–Whitney U test for continuous volume data. For variables in which a significant difference was noted, we calculated the odds ratio (95  % confidence interval) and the effective dose. There were 93 teeth in the normal group and 16 teeth in the high group based on periodontal mechanosensitive threshold. Comparison of the two groups indicated no significant differences associated with age, sex, duration following superstructure placement, or presence or absence of dental pulp. A significant difference was noted with regard to <b>occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> area, with several high group subjects belonging to the small contact group (odds ratio: 4.75 [1.42 – 15.87]; effective dose: 0.29). The {{results of this study suggest}} an association between implant <b>occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> area and the periodontal mechanosensitive threshold of adjacent premolars. Smaller <b>occlusal</b> <b>contact</b> application resulted in an increased threshold.
