5|$|Catherine {{believed}} in the humanist ideal of the learned Renaissance prince whose authority depended on letters as well as arms. She {{was inspired by the}} example of her father-in-law, King Francis I of France, who had hosted the leading artists of Europe at his court, and by her Medici ancestors. <b>In</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> of civil war and declining respect for the monarchy, she sought to bolster royal prestige through lavish cultural display. Once in control of the royal purse, she launched a programme of artistic patronage that lasted for three decades. During this time, she presided over a distinctive late French Renaissance culture in all branches of the arts.|$|E

5|$|New Age thought {{typically}} envisions {{the world}} as developing through cosmological cycles which can be identified astrologically. It adopts this concept from Theosophy, although often presents it in a looser and more eclectic way than is found in Theosophical teaching. New Age literature often claims that humanity once lived <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> of spiritual wisdom. In the writings of New Agers like Edgar Cayce, the ancient period of spiritual wisdom is associated with concepts of supremely-advanced societies living on lost continents such as Atlantis, Lemuria, and Mu, {{as well as the}} idea that ancient societies like those of Ancient Egypt were far more technologically advanced than modern scholarship accepts.|$|E

5|$|T.F. Tout, in 1914 one of {{the first}} historians to make a {{thorough}} academic study of the period, considered Pembroke the one favourable exception <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> of small-minded and incompetent leaders. Tout wrote of a 'middle party', led by Pembroke, representing a moderate position between the extremes of Edward and Lancaster. This 'middle party' supposedly took control of royal government through the Treaty of Leake in 1318. In his authoritative study of 1972, J.R.S. Phillips rejects this view. In spite of misgivings with the King’s favourites, Pembroke was consistently loyal to Edward. What was accomplished in 1318 was not the takeover by a 'middle party', but simply a restoration of royal power.|$|E
5|$|Using {{the power}} of a {{powerful}} substance known as aer, mankind is <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> of discovery and prosperity. The crystallized form of aer, which is known as Apatheia, {{is considered to be a}} very powerful energy source as it is essential to human life. To protect towns from attacks by monsters, large amounts of Apatheia are being produced to create barriers around towns. One day, in a forest near the town of Shizontania, Yuri Lowell and Flynn Scifo, two knights who have just joined the Niren Corps, together with two of their senior knights and fellow Corps members, Hisca and Chastel, are sent on a mission to investigate an abnormal gushing of aer in the area.|$|E

Under cathodic polarization potential, hydrogen embrittlement was observed <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>aged</b> alloy with prime-phase precipitation or via solid-solution treatment, while strong cracking resistance was observed for the aged material with carbide precipitation...|$|R
5|$|Beginning in the mid-3rd {{century the}} {{emperors}} began to favor {{members of the}} equestrian order over senators, who had had a monopoly {{on the most important}} offices of state. Senators were stripped of the command of legions and most provincial governorships (as it was felt that they lacked the specialized military upbringing needed <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> of acute defense needs), such posts being given to equestrians by Diocletian and his colleagues—following a practice enforced piecemeal by their predecessors. The emperors, however, still needed the talents and the help of the very rich, who were relied on to maintain social order and cohesion by means of a web of powerful influence and contacts at all levels. Exclusion of the old senatorial aristocracy threatened this arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Catherine's {{three sons}} reigned <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> of almost {{constant}} civil and religious war in France. The {{problems facing the}} monarchy were complex and daunting but Catherine {{was able to keep}} the monarchy and the state institutions functioning even at a minimum level. At first, Catherine compromised and made concessions to the rebelling Protestants, or Huguenots, as they became known. She failed, however, to grasp the theological issues that drove their movement. Later she resorted, in frustration and anger, to hard-line policies against them. In return, she came to be blamed for the excessive persecutions carried out under her sons' rule, in particular for the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre of 1572, in which thousands of Huguenots were killed in Paris and throughout France.|$|E
5|$|Her {{story is}} a {{reminder}} that the universal denigration of a group, based on the behaviour of a few, cannot cloud the greatness of the individual. Mandodari defies the stereotype of this racism. She is simple, unswerving, and self-effacing, driven by the light of knowledge which gives meaning to solid materialism <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> that is shrouded by impulse, passion, and desire. She is the instrument that awakens the mind and counsels reason when irrationality becomes the core being. That she goes unheard and unheeded does not change her path. To her, the dharmic part is inward-looking, while the role of the dutiful wife is the external self. Mandodari thought that her duty to her husband on issues of morals and values ended with her telling him what she thought of his actions. She neither put up any brave fight to stop him nor considered it her duty to do so.|$|E

5|$|In 1678, Ashmole {{stood as}} a {{candidate}} in a by-election for the Lichfield borough parliamentary constituency caused {{by the death of}} one of the two incumbent members.

Ashmole did not visit the constituency, and, as Ashmole's own horoscope had predicted, he lost the election. He also put himself forward {{as a candidate}} in the general election of 1685. Surviving documents indicate that he was the most popular candidate, but after King James II requested he stand down (<b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> when monarchs were likely to interfere with parliamentary elections), Ashmole did so. On election day, all the votes cast for Ashmole, instead of being declared invalid, were declared as votes for the King's candidate, and only {{as a result of this}} ruse was the candidate favoured by the Court (Richard Leveson) elected.|$|E
5|$|In 1681, King Charles II gave Penn a {{large piece}} of his newly {{acquired}} American land holdings to repay a debt the king owed to Admiral Sir William Penn, Penn's father. This land included present-day Pennsylvania and Delaware, though the claim as written would create a bloody conflict with Maryland (dubbed Cresap's War) over the land grant already owned by Lord Baltimore. Penn put together a colonial expedition and fleet, which set out for America {{in the middle of the}} following summer. Penn, sailing in the vanguard, first set foot on American soil at the colony at New Castle, Delaware. An orderly change of government ensued, as was normal <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> used to the privileges and prerogatives of aristocracy and which antedated nationalism: the colonists pledged allegiance to Penn as their new Proprietor. The first Pennsylvania General Assembly was soon held in the colony.|$|E

Assisted by the Zerg, Terran and Protoss forces, the empowered Kerrigan vanquishes Amon, before disappearing without a trace. Two years later, Kerrigan appears before Raynor in human form and he departs with her to never be heard from again, while the Zerg, the Terran and the Protoss civilizations begin to rebuild <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> of peace and prosperity.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> of {{classical}} Sanskrit literature, Madhava II (brother of King Vishnugopa) wrote a treatise Dattaka Sutravritti {{which was based}} on an earlier work on erotics by a writer called Dattaka. A Sanskrit version of Vaddakatha, a commentary on Pāṇini's grammar called Sabdavathara and a commentary on the 15th chapter of a Sanskrit work called Kiratarjunneya by poet Bharavi (who was in Durvinita's court) are ascribed to Durvinita. King Shivamara II is known to have written Gajamata Kalpana. Hemasena, also known as Vidya Dhananjaya authored Raghavapandaviya, a narration of the stories of Rama and the Pandavas simultaneously through puns. Gayachintamani and Kshatrachudamini which were based on poet Bana's work Kadambari were written by Hemasena's pupil Vadeebhasimha in prose style. and Chavundaraya wrote Charitarasara.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the {{north-western}} regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that {{were known as}} the mahajanapadas. The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira. Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling {{the life of the}} Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India. <b>In</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal, and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire. The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent excepting the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas. The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma.|$|E
5|$|In the {{southern}} regions of Karnataka, the Western Gangas of Talakad were contemporaries of the Kadambas. The Kadambas and Gangas {{were followed by}} the imperial dynasties of the Badami Chalukya Empire, the Rashtrakuta Empire, the Western Chalukya Empire, the Hoysala Empire and the Vijayanagara Empire, all patronising the ancient Indic religions while showing tolerance to the new cultures arriving from {{the west of the}} subcontinent. The Muslim invasion of the Deccan resulted in the breaking away of the feudatory Sultanates in the 14th century. The rule of the Bahamani Sultanate of Bidar and the Bijapur Sultanate from the northern Deccan region caused a mingling of the ancient Hindu traditions with the nascent Islamic culture in the region. The hereditary ruling families and clans ably served the large empires and upheld the local culture and traditions. The fall of the Vijayanagara Empire in 1565 brought about a slow disintegration of Kannada-speaking regions into minor kingdoms that struggled to maintain autonomy <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>age</b> dominated by foreigners until unification and independence in 1947.|$|E
