The number of bacteria bound per macrophage was 6. 9, as determined by microscopic examination. Methyl a-mannoside (0. 1 mM) and p-nitrophenyl a-mannoside (0. 01 mM) inhibited this binding by about 66 %. The ability of peritoneal macrophages to bind <b>E.</b> <b>coil</b> in a mannose-specific manner was confirmed in further experiments using an enzyme-linked immu-nosorbent assay (ELISA) with an antibacterial antibody, radiolabelled <b>E.</b> <b>coil,</b> and counts of colony-forming units (CFU). The number of bacteria bound per macrophage was 7 to 12 in the ELISA and 5. 5 - 8. 5 in the CFU assay. Methyl a-mannoside caused 70 % inhibition of binding in the ELISA and 84 % in the CFU assay, whereas p-nitrophenyl a-mannoside showed inhibition of 79 % and 90 %, respectively.

40|$|Many {{bacteria}} persist within phagocytes, deploying complex sets of tightly regulated virulence {{factors to}} manipulate and survive within host cells. So far, no single factor {{has been identified}} that is sufficient to allow intracellular persistence of an otherwise non-pathogenic bacterium. Here we report that the two-component KdpD/KdpE sensor kinase/response regulator of the insect and human pathogen Photorhabdus asymbiotica (Pa) is sufficient to allow a harmless laboratory strain of <b>E.</b> <b>coil</b> to resist phagocytic killing and persist within insect hemocytes, ultimately killing the insect. Screening of a cosmid library of Pa in <b>E.</b> <b>coil</b> by injection into the moth Manduca sexta, previously identified three overlapping clones which caused the insect to cease feeding and subsequently die. Transposon mutagenesis revealed a cosmid encoded kdp high affinity potassium pump regulon was responsible for this phenotype. Gentamycin protection assays and confocal microscopy revealed the cosmid clones were persisting inside insect hemocytes far longer than control bacteria. Cloning and expression of Pa kdpD/kdpE alone into <b>E.</b> <b>coil</b> recapitulated the phenotype. Bioassay results and transcriptional analysis of various <b>E.</b> <b>coil</b> kdp mutants harboring the Pa kdp genes confirmed that Pa KdpD/KdpE was able to induce the <b>E.</b> <b>coil</b> kdp pump structural genes in response to exposure to insect hemocytes but not blood plasma alone.

As no clear definition of disorder exists, we have developed parameters based on several alternative definitions and introduced a new one based {{on the concept of}} “hot loops,” i. <b>e.,</b> <b>coils</b> with high temperature factors. Avoiding potentially disordered segments in protein expression constructs can increase expression, foldability, and stability of the expressed protein.

They produced small amounts of putrescine (similar to 1. 3 mmol/kg) and cadaverine (similar to 0. 9 mmol/kg) in cheese after 28 days, and did not affect levels of volatile aroma compounds. Further work on H. alvei strain B 16 showed that <b>E.</b> <b>coil</b> O 26 :H 11, inoculated at 2 log CFU/ml, was inhibited by H. alvei 816 inoculated at 6 log CFU/ml and not at 4. 5 log CFU/ml. The inhibition was associated neither with lower pH values in cheese after 6 or 24 h, nor with higher concentrations of lactic acid. Enhanced concentrations of acetic acid on day 1 in cheese inoculated with H. alvei B 16 (4 to 11 mmol/kg) could not fully explain the reduction in <b>E.</b> <b>coil</b> O 26 :H 11 growth. A synergistic interaction between H. alvei B 16 and the microbial consortium, resulting in an additional 0. 7 -log reduction in E. coli O 26 :H 11 counts, was observed from day 8 in model cheeses made from pasteurized milk.

In this paper a novel semi-automated method for segmenting aneurysms in Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) data based on Geodesic Active Contours is presented and quantitatively evaluated. Three different image features are used to steer the level set to the boundary of the aneurysm, namely intensity, gradient magnitude and variance in intensity. The method requires minimum user interaction, i. e. clicking a single seed point inside the aneurysm which is used to estimate the vessel intensity distribution and to initialize the level set.

Euplokamis sp. densities in the deep water of the Gullmar fjord in June 2011 reached similar densities as the local ctenophore Beroe spp. The presence of Euplokamis sp. and other ctenophores in the area is discussed together with the importance of continuous monitoring of gelatinous forms to include detection of less frequent and more fragile ctenophore species. We also discuss the importance of molecular identification for ctenophore larvae and adult ctenophores of small size...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The chitosan(CS) /polyurethane(PU) blend nanofibers {{have been}} {{prepared}} {{for the first time}} by electrospinning. Formic acid (FA) and Hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) were found to be the co-solvent for electrospinning. The CS/PU blend solutions in various ratios were studied for electrospinning into nanofibers. The diameter and morphology of the fibers were shown by scanning electron microscope (SEM). It was found that the average diameter of the chitosan/PU blend fibers became larger, and the morphology of the fibers became finer with the content of PU increasing. To show the molecular interactions, CS/PU fibers were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Moreover, the antibaterial activity of blend nanofibers against Escherichia coil (<b>E.</b> <b>coil)</b> was measured via optical density method. The blend nanofibers exhibited satisfying antibacterial activity against <b>E.</b> <b>coil,</b> even the chitosan concentration was only 5 wt%. Therefore, the spun nanofibers are expected {{to be used in the}} native extracellular matrix for tissue engineering. 1...|$|E
40|$|Cefotaxime (HR 756) was {{compared}} with cefazolin and cephaloridine {{with regard to}} the rate of bacterial killing and to the influence on the bactericidal activity of human serum and polyrnorphonuclear leukocytes. At concentrations equal to 1 - 2 x MIC cefotaxime showed a more rapid and complete bactericidal activity on <b>E.</b> <b>coil</b> K 12 than cephaloridine and cefazolin. In presence of the latters in fact, bacterial regrowth was observed after 24 hours. On S. aureus a complete killing activity of cefotaxime appeared at concentrations of 8 x MIC. A synergism seemed to exist between the complement dependent bactericidal activity of normal human serum and cephalosporins. <b>E.</b> <b>coil</b> K 12 (a rough strain) was killed by the combination of human serum and both cefotaxime and cefazolin at concentrations that were not bactericidal by themselves. Cephaloridine on the contrary showed an additive activity with normal human serum. Finally evidence that cefotaxime enhanced the bactericidal activity of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes against S. faecaiis, is reported...|$|E

The {{structure and the}} performance of Cu-HMS were characterized by XRD, TG-DTA, ESR, UV-Vis, FT-IR, ESEM, EDS and N 2 adsorptionª² desorption isotherms. Based on bacteriostasis experiments of <b>E.</b> <b>coil,</b> S. aureus, B. subtilis and G. bacillus, the antibacterial ability of the sample was also investigated. The results show that the particles of Cu-HMS look like regular thallus, the specific surface area is 533 m 2 /g, the average pore size is 3. 6 nm, and the copper ions are presented in framework of the sample, especially. The sample has favorable mesoporous structure, thermal stability and ultraviolet-visible-light absorption ability. Furthermore, The bacteriostasis experimental results show that Cu-HMS has favourable and steady antibacterial ability. When the dosage of Cu-HMS is 20 mg/L, the bacteriostasis ability may be visibly detected in 12 h, while the dosage is up to 200 mg/L, <b>E.</b> <b>coil,</b> S. aureus and B. subtilis may be killed after 24 h. </P...|$|E
40|$|Process {{intensification}} via miniaturization {{has become}} an attractive research field for industry and R 2 ̆ 6 amp;D especially {{for the production of}} fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals due to enhanced mass and heat transport. Fabrication of helically coiled tubular devices (HCTDs) in micro-scale can further enhance the mass and heat transfer due to the formation of secondary flow profile at laminar flow. Liquid–liquid (L–L) mass transfer performance of different microstructured HCTDs were investigated for slug flow patterns. A complete microextraction system was constructed and characterized including a T-junction (T-mixer) for slug flow generation, HCTDs as residence time units (RTUs), and a continuously working in-line phase splitter for an instantaneous phase separation. RTUs were fabricated by using fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) tubes (ID = 1 mm). EFCE test system, namely, n-butyl acetate/acetone/water system was chosen as an extraction system for the mass transfer characterization. The total volumetric flow rate and the volumetric flow ratio of aqueous to organic phase were varied in the range of 1 – 8 mL min− 1 and 0. 5 – 2. 0, respectively. Effects of residence time, flow ratio, and the generation of secondary flow profile, i. e. Dean vortices on L–L mass transfer were investigated and results were compared with straight capillaries. Results revealed that a certain type of HCTD, i. <b>e.</b> <b>coiled</b> flow inverter (CFI) offers higher extraction efficiencies up to 20...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} simple phenomenological model for {{describing}} the conformational dynamics of biopolymers via the nonlinearity-induced buckling and collapse (i. <b>e.</b> <b>coiling</b> up) instabilities. Taking {{into account the}} coupling between the internal and mechanical degrees of freedom of a semiflexible biopolymer chain, we show that self-trapped internal excitations (such as amide-I vibrations in proteins, base-pair vibrations in DNA, or polarons in proteins) may produce the buckling and collapse instabilities of an initially straight chain. These instabilities remain latent in a straight infinitely long chain, because the bending of such a chain would require an infinite energy. However, they manifest themselves {{as soon as we}} consider more realistic cases and take into account a finite length of the chain. In this case the nonlinear localized modes may act as drivers giving impetus to the conformational dynamics of biopolymers. The buckling instability is responsible, in particular, for the large-amplitude localized bending waves which accompany the nonlinear modes propagating along the chain. In the case of the collapse instability, the chain folds into a compact three-dimensional coil. The viscous damping of the aqueous environment only slows down the folding of the chain, but does not stop it even for a large damping. We find that these effects are only weakly affected by the peculiarities of the interaction potentials, and thus they should be generic for different models of semiflexible chains carrying nonlinear localized excitations.
