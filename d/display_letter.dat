5000|$|Comix-ART {{has been}} {{repeatedly}} criticized for {{the choice of}} fonts used to <b>display</b> <b>letters</b> inside the word balloons and for the placing of words in bubbles. AniMag editor commented on their publication of Naruto that a reader cannot distinguish some letters [...] "without a magnifying glass".|$|R

50|$|At Systems Resources Corporation, Mechner {{provided}} all {{capital for}} its {{first five years of}} operation and Leonard provided his engineering expertise. During 1966-1972, Systems Resources Corporation developed several innovative digital technology-based products, including a digital graphics generator for <b>displaying</b> <b>letters</b> on a television screen that it called “Chiron,” named after the centaur in Greek mythology. The device controlled the edging of the displayed characters in a manner that took background variables into account.|$|R
50|$|The exact {{appearance}} of emoji is not prescribed but varies between fonts, {{in the same}} way that normal typefaces can <b>display</b> <b>letters</b> differently. For example, the Apple Color Emoji typeface is proprietary to Apple, and can only be used on Apple devices (without additional hacking). Different computing companies have developed their own fonts to display emoji, some of which have been open-sourced to permit their reuse. Both colour and monochrome emoji typefaces exist, as well as at least one animated design.|$|R

5000|$|The hornbook, {{a form of}} ABC book, {{was common}} by Shakespeare's day. It {{consisted}} {{of a piece of}} parchment or paper pasted on a wooden board and protected by a leaf of horn. Hornbooks <b>displayed</b> <b>letters</b> of the alphabet, a [...] and prayers for novice readers. Andrew Tuer [...] described a typical hornbook with a line separating the lower case and capital letters from the syllabary. This syllabarium or syllabary, likely added to the hornbook in 1596, taught pronunciations of vowel and consonant combinations.|$|R

50|$|He is {{selected}} by the printer/publisher for book collecting Pierre Bricage to illustrate Boileau’s complete works in five volumes (1962). It {{should be noted that}} this choice is made after having been in competition with the 1960 Prix de Rome prize winner. Five years will be necessary to fulfill this work (65 original burin engravings, 39 <b>display</b> <b>letters</b> by woodcut). Competing for the Prix de Rome (line engraving) 1962, he obtains the third place. From 1965 to 1978, he works for a company where he is responsible for design and production of stands decors.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} phrases {{come from}} a portable media player's seven-segment display. They give a good illustration of an application where a seven-segment display may be sufficient for <b>displaying</b> <b>letters,</b> since the relevant messages are neither critical nor in any significant risk of being misunderstood, much due to the limited number and rigid domain specificity of the messages. As such, {{there is no direct}} need for a more expressive display in this case, although even a slightly wider repertoire of messages would require at least a 14-segment display or a dot matrix one.|$|R

50|$|A fourteen-segment display (FSD) (sometimes {{referred}} to as a starburst display) is a type of display based on 14 segments that can be turned on or off to produce letters and numerals. It is an expansion of the more common seven-segment display, having an additional four diagonal and two vertical segments with the middle horizontal segment broken in half. A seven-segment display suffices for numerals and certain letters, but unambiguously rendering the ISO basic Latin alphabet requires more detail. A slight variation is the sixteen-segment display which allows additional legibility in <b>displaying</b> <b>letters</b> or other symbols.|$|R
50|$|In March 1985, both contestants {{began using}} {{the same set of}} words. The {{champion}} was placed in isolation while the Crossword winner played, then tried to beat the time set. In addition, after a contestant called one of the two <b>displayed</b> <b>letters,</b> the other one disappeared and two new letters were presented as long as there were at least three blanks left in the word. The contestant was shown only one letter when there were two blanks. This change remained in place {{for the remainder of the}} series run, and a fourth word was later added to the Sprint.|$|R

40|$|Four {{experiments}} {{examined the}} ability of respondents to identify <b>letters</b> that were <b>displayed</b> on an LED array with flashes lasting {{little more than a}} microsecond. The first experiment <b>displayed</b> each <b>letter</b> with a single, simultaneous flash of all the dots forming the letter and established the relation of flash intensity to the probability of letter identification. The second experiment <b>displayed</b> the <b>letters</b> with multiple flashes at different frequencies to determine the probability that the sequence of flashes would be perceived as fused. The third experiment <b>displayed</b> the <b>letters</b> at a frequency that was above the flicker-fusion frequency, varying flash intensity to establish the amount needed to elicit a given probability of letter identification. The fourth experiment <b>displayed</b> each <b>letter</b> twice, once at a frequency where no flicker was perceived and also with steady light emission. The intensity of each flash was fixed and the steady intensity was varied; respondents were asked to judge whether the fused-flicker display and the steady display appeared to be the same brightness. Steady intensity was about double the average flash intensity where the two conditions were perceived as being equal in brightness. This is at odds with Talbot-Plateau law, which predicts that these two values should be equal. The law was formulated relative to a flash lasting half of each period, so it is surprising that it comes this close to being correct where the flash occupies only a millionth of the total period...|$|R

Mitchell refuses, but he does tell Manny {{what to say to}} Cameron, who at the end does not listen to the kids and imposes his show on them. The closing of the show involves the kids <b>displaying</b> <b>letters</b> that form the phrase [...] "We love the world," [...] and the letter [...] "F" [...] (representing Franklin Middle School) coming down from the sky. When the show starts, the kids are exhausted but continue with it, but things start to go awry when Luke can not land because the machinery gets stuck, and the props start to fall over.|$|R

A small museum in the school house, established with financial support from the German government, <b>displays</b> <b>letters</b> and photographs recounting the migration of the villagers' ancestors to Kyrgyzstan and their past life in the village. Since the beginning of the 1990s, the German government has also provided a German teacher for the community. Generous financial and material aid from the German government for the local agricultural cooperative has, however, for the most part been wasted or misused.|$|R
