5|$|Jennifer {{enters a}} room, where she discovers Dan Barrows. Dan awakens and chases Jennifer to a steep cliff. She {{successfully}} climbs over, knocking down {{a can of}} kerosene which splashes onto a nearby candle. This triggers an <b>explosion</b> <b>that</b> immolates Dan, while Jennifer rides an elevator out of the catacombs. She ends up defeating Bobby and Mary in the clock tower.|$|E
5|$|On August 8, 2012, a {{controlled}} blast at 72nd Street caused rocks {{to fly over}} the station site. Nearly two weeks later, on August 21, 2012, an uncontrolled blast for the Second Avenue Subway station at 72nd Street was done incorrectly, causing a large <b>explosion</b> <b>that</b> sent debris {{into the air and}} broke windows of buildings in the area and damaged nearby sidewalks.|$|E
5|$|The Great New York City Fire of 1845 {{broke out}} on July 19, 1845. The fire started in a whale oil and candle {{manufacturing}} establishment and quickly {{spread to other}} wooden structures in New York City the neighborhood. It reached a warehouse on Broad Street where combustible saltpeter was stored and caused a massive <b>explosion</b> <b>that</b> spread the fire even farther.|$|E

Most {{of the dead and}} injured were enlisted African American sailors.|$|E
5|$|As in most Sonic series games, the Chaos Emeralds {{play a major}} role; {{they help}} Shadow {{remember}} his past and allow him to perform Chaos Control and Chaos Blast. Chaos Control allows Shadow to move more quickly in levels and slows time in boss battles, and Chaos Blast creates an <b>explosion</b> <b>that</b> destroys or severely damages all nearby enemies. Shadow can perform Chaos Control after the player fills the Hero Gauge by defeating Black Arms soldiers, and he can perform Chaos Blast after filling the Dark Gauge by defeating G.U.N. soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Drinking in {{the village}} pub, Danny and Angel meet Simon Skinner, manager of the local supermarket, and George Merchant, a wealthy {{drunkard}} who made his fortune selling kitchen goods. Danny takes Angel home and the two binge-watch action movies. That evening, an unseen figure causes a gas <b>explosion</b> <b>that</b> destroys Merchant's mansion, killing him. The incident is deemed an accident and Angel is ridiculed for believing otherwise.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, the Armour Research Foundation (ARF), {{based at}} the Illinois Institute of Technology, began {{studying}} the effects of nuclear explosions on the environment. These studies continued until 1962. In May 1958, ARF began covertly researching the potential consequences of an atomic explosion on the Moon. The main objective of the program, which ran {{under the auspices of}} the United States Air Force, which had initially proposed it, was to cause a nuclear <b>explosion</b> <b>that</b> would be visible from Earth. It was hoped that such a display would boost the morale of the American people.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the five}} major volcanoes in Washington, only Glacier Peak and Mount St. Helens have had large eruptions {{in the past}} 15,000 years. Since both volcanoes {{generate}} magma of dacitic origin, the viscous magma builds up since it cannot flow through the eruptive vent. Gradually, the pressure grows, culminating in an <b>explosion</b> <b>that</b> ejects materials such as tephra, which in its simplest form, is ash.|$|E
5|$|Ronan {{meets with}} Gamora's adoptive father, Thanos, to discuss her betrayal. Quill's group flee to Knowhere, a remote {{criminal}} outpost in space {{built in the}} giant severed head of a Celestial. A drunken Drax summons Ronan {{while the rest of}} the group meet Gamora's contact, the collector Taneleer Tivan. Tivan opens the orb, revealing an Infinity Stone, an item of immeasurable power that destroys all but the most powerful beings who wield it. Tivan's tormented assistant Carina grabs the Stone, triggering an <b>explosion</b> <b>that</b> engulfs Tivan's archive.|$|E

5|$|The {{story begins}} on April Fools' Day as Homer is playing pranks on Bart {{throughout}} the day. Bart, {{angered by the}} numerous tricks he has fallen for, attempts to get revenge by shaking up a beer in a paint shaker. When Homer opens the beer, it results in a massive <b>explosion</b> <b>that</b> puts him in the hospital, paralyzed {{and placed in a}} wheelchair. While everyone waits for Homer to get well, the family remembers surviving similar hardships, shown in the form of clips from past episodes.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory of}} this type of {{supernova}} {{is similar to that of}} novae, in which a white dwarf accretes matter more slowly and does not approach the Chandrasekhar limit. In the case of a nova, the in-falling matter causes a hydrogen fusion surface <b>explosion</b> <b>that</b> does not disrupt the star. This type of supernova differs from a core-collapse supernova, which is caused by the cataclysmic explosion of the outer layers of a massive star as its core implodes.|$|E
5|$|Vérité {{took the}} French President on a {{goodwill}} trip to Russia in 1908 and visited America in September 1909. In September 1911, she was {{damaged by the}} <b>explosion</b> <b>that</b> destroyed her sister Liberté in Toulon. At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, she covered troop convoys from North Africa to France {{along with the rest}} of the French Mediterranean Fleet. She spent the rest of the war based at Corfu and later Mudros, without seeing any action at either location. After the end of the war, she was stricken from the naval register and broken up for scrap in 1922.|$|E

5|$|Yahweh gave materialistic {{explanations}} of the Garden of Eden, a large laboratory {{that was based on}} an artificially constructed continent; Noah's Ark, a spaceship that preserved DNA that was used to resurrect animals through cloning; the Tower of Babel, a rocket that was supposed to reach the creators' planet; and the Great Flood, the byproduct of a nuclear missile <b>explosion</b> <b>that</b> the Elohim sent. After tidal wave floods following the explosions receded, Elohim scattered the Israelites and had them speak the language of other tribes.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Parsons {{separated}} from Helen after {{having an affair}} with her sister Sara; when Sara left him for L. Ron Hubbard, he conducted the Babalon Working, a series of rituals designed to invoke the Thelemic goddess Babalon to Earth. He and Hubbard continued the procedure with Marjorie Cameron, whom Parsons married in 1946. After Hubbard and Sara defrauded him of his life savings, Parsons resigned from the O.T.O. and went through various jobs while acting as a consultant for the Israeli rocket program. Amid the climate of McCarthyism, he was accused of espionage and left unable to work in rocketry. In 1952, Parsons {{died at the age of}} 37 in a home laboratory <b>explosion</b> <b>that</b> attracted national media attention; the police ruled it an accident, but many associates suspected suicide or assassination.|$|E
5|$|The Queen Anne's Revenge {{heads for}} Whitecap Bay {{to find and}} harvest mermaid tears. After {{managing}} to lure in a mermaid named Tamara, she summons other mermaids to attack the crew before Jack causes an <b>explosion</b> <b>that</b> scares them away. A mermaid named Syrena is caught, but Philip Swift, a captive missionary, {{falls in love with}} her. Reaching Ponce de León's ship on an uncharted island, Angelica and Blackbeard coerce Jack into retrieving both chalices. Jack locates the grounded, decaying vessel, only to find Barbossa there. Both guess that the Spanish have taken the chalices, after they are nowhere to be found on the vessel.|$|E

5|$|The {{player has}} access to unlockable {{abilities}} that can open new paths of exploration, such as shrinking to access small areas like vents, teleportation which allows the player to reach otherwise unreachable platforms, and farts which trigger an <b>explosion</b> <b>that</b> defeats nearby enemies when combined with a naked flame. Actions committed against enemies outside of battle affects them in combat; the player or opponent who strikes first to trigger a fight will have the first turn in battle. Combat {{takes place in a}} battle area separate from the open game world. Battles use turn-based gameplay and each character takes a turn to attack or defend before yielding to the next character.|$|E
5|$|The {{supernova}} <b>explosion</b> <b>that</b> {{formed the}} Vela Supernova Remnant most likely occurred 10,000–20,000 years ago. In 1976, NASA astronomers suggested that {{inhabitants of the}} southern hemisphere may have witnessed this explosion and recorded it symbolically. A year later, archaeologist George Michanowsky recalled some incomprehensible ancient markings in Bolivia that were left by Native Americans. The carvings showed four small circles flanked by two larger circles. The smaller circles resemble stellar groupings in the constellations Vela and Carina. One of the larger circles may represent the star Capella. Another circle is located near {{the position of the}} supernova remnant, George Michanowsky suggested this may represent the supernova explosion as witnessed by the indigenous residents.|$|E
5|$|Type Ia supernovae, {{that involve}} helium {{accretion}} {{by a white}} dwarf, have been proposed to be a channel for transformation {{of this type of}} stellar remnant. In this scenario, the carbon detonation produced in a Type Ia supernova is too weak to destroy the white dwarf, expelling just a small part of its mass as ejecta, but produces an asymmetric <b>explosion</b> <b>that</b> kicks the star, often known as a zombie star, to high speeds of a hypervelocity star. The matter processed in the failed detonation is re-accreted by the white dwarf with the heaviest elements such as iron falling to its core where it accumulates. These iron-core white dwarfs would be smaller than the carbon-oxygen kind of similar mass and would cool and crystallize faster than those.|$|E
50|$|On June 18, 2013, several strong explosions {{rocked the}} town and several villages around; 5,000 people were evacuated. According to Russian media, at least 34 people where injured in the <b>explosions</b> <b>that</b> {{originated}} in the town's ammunition storage facilities.|$|R
50|$|Less typically, {{nuclear fallout}} is the {{distribution}} of radioactive contamination by the 520 atmospheric nuclear <b>explosions</b> <b>that</b> took place from the 1950s to the 1980s. The amount of radioactive material released in an incident is called the source term.|$|R
5|$|There are {{two types}} of eruptions in terms of activity, {{explosive}} eruptions and effusive eruptions. Explosive eruptions are characterized by gas-driven <b>explosions</b> <b>that</b> propels magma and tephra. Effusive eruptions, meanwhile, are characterized by the outpouring of lava without significant explosive eruption.|$|R
