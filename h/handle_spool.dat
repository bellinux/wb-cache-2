50|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2015, Printrbot announced two new initiatives to help schools gain access to 3D printers. The first program, named Printrbot Ambassadors, lets registered schools borrow an assembled Printrbot Simple Metal with an Alu <b>handle,</b> <b>spool</b> holder and 1 kg of filament for a month for free. The only cost is for shipping. After the month, the school has the option to buy the 3D printer at a reduced price or to {{send it back to}} Printrbot. The second program allows schools to buy a Printrbot Simple Metal for USD 399.00. You need to buy under a school and accept to be featured on a public listing. As of August 2, 2015, approximately 126 schools and universities are using Printrbot 3D printer.|$|E

The tape was liable to snap, particularly at joins, which at that speed could rapidly cover the floor with loops of the sharp-edged tape. Rewinding was done at twice the speed of the recording.|$|R

5000|$|Larry Niven's Ringworld (1970): Louis Wu {{uses his}} [...] "flashlight laser" [...] as a sword of {{indefinite}} length. Ringworld {{also features a}} [...] "variable sword", consisting of a <b>handle</b> containing a <b>spool</b> of invisibly thin, molecule-thick wire. In use the wire is unspooled to the desired length and made rigid by a [...] "stasis field". Some depictions show the field glowing.|$|R
5000|$|Rudy Davis (voiced by Eric Suter) is a sharp-dressed, smooth talking, cocky huckster whose smart-aleck {{attitude}} frequently {{gets him}} into trouble. He is Dumb Donald's best friend. Rudy's cocky attitude and dismissive demeanor {{are often the}} catalyst for a typical plot's conflict. But inside {{he has a good}} heart and usually learns lessons from his mistakes. In the Junkyard Band, he plays a makeshift banjo, whose parts include a broomstick <b>handle</b> and sewing-thread <b>spool</b> to hold the strings. However, when shown playing apart from the others, Rudy plays an electric guitar (personalized with a big [...] "R"). He always wears an orange flat cap, a fuchsia vest, a pink turtleneck, purple bell-bottom jeans, and boots. Rudy's personality in the Fat Albert movie is much different as he is portrayed as a kind and chivalrous gentleman who falls in love with the female lead Doris (Kyla Pratt).|$|R
