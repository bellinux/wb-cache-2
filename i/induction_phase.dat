5|$|First {{reported}} in 2003, {{the idea of}} using a form of the Atkins diet to treat epilepsy came about after parents and patients discovered that the <b>induction</b> <b>phase</b> of the Atkins diet controlled seizures. The ketogenic diet team at Johns Hopkins Hospital modified the Atkins diet by removing the aim of achieving weight loss, extending the <b>induction</b> <b>phase</b> indefinitely, and specifically encouraging fat consumption. Compared with the ketogenic diet, the modified Atkins diet (MAD) places no limit on calories or protein, and the lower overall ketogenic ratio (approximately 1:1) {{does not need to be}} consistently maintained by all meals of the day. The MAD does not begin with a fast or with a stay in hospital and requires less dietitian support than the ketogenic diet. Carbohydrates are initially limited to 10g per day in children or 20g per day in adults, and are increased to 20–30g per day after a month or so, depending on the effect on seizure control or tolerance of the restrictions. Like the ketogenic diet, the MAD requires vitamin and mineral supplements and children are carefully and periodically monitored at outpatient clinics.|$|E

40|$|A {{considerable}} body {{of evidence}} points to a role for both cyclin E/cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 2 activity and E 2 F transcription activity in the <b>induction</b> of S <b>phase.</b> We show that overexpression of cyclin E/cdk 2 in quiescent cells induces S phase, that this coincides with an induction of E 2 F activity, and that coexpression of E 2 F enhances the cyclin E/cdk 2 -mediated <b>induction</b> of S <b>phase.</b> Likewise, E 2 F overexpression can induce S phase and does so in the apparent absence of cyclin E/cdk 2 activity. In addition, although the inhibition of cyclin E/cdk 2 activity blocks the <b>induction</b> of S <b>phase</b> after growth stimulation of normal mouse embryo fibroblasts, inhibition of cyclin E/cdk 2 does not block S <b>phase</b> <b>induction</b> in Rb−/− cells where E 2 F activity is deregulated.

For a six <b>phase</b> <b>induction</b> motor drive harmonics of the order 6 n± 1 (n= 1, 3, 5 etc.,) will {{not contribute to the}} air gap flux and hence these harmonic currents are limited by the stator impedance only. So harmonic filters are needed for the suppression of these 6 n± 1 (n= 1, 3, 5 etc.,) high amplitude harmonic currents, when a six <b>phase</b> <b>induction</b> motor is used for variable speed application.
