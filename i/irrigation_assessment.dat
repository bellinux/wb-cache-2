40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{knowledge-based}} model for supplementary <b>irrigation</b> <b>assessment</b> in rainfed agricultural watersheds is presented. The supplementary <b>irrigation</b> <b>assessment</b> problem {{is divided into}} different components and is modeled separately. Geographic Information System (GIS) is used to aggregate spatially varying attributes required for the modeling. A graphical user interface is developed in a GIS platform by using the ERDAS macro language tools. The model was applied to two case study areas in India: a subwatershed of Gandheshwari area (West Bengal), and Harsul watershed (Maharashtra). In the Gandheshwari subwatershed, the water availability {{was found to be}} inadequate to meet the irrigation requirement and hence the model identified the areas that can be irrigated with different outsource water supply. On the other hand, surface runoff generated in the Harsul watershed was found to be sufficient to meet the supplementary irrigation requirement, thereby showing the feasibility for supplementary irrigation in the area. Using the model, the effect of any rainfall condition can be simulated and hence appropriate measures can be taken in advance {{to reduce the risk of}} crop failure...|$|E

Experimental data, obtained from an <b>irrigation</b> <b>assessment,</b> {{conducted during the}} 1995 and 1996 maize growth-seasons at Zaragoza, Spain, was compared to the mechanistic-model SWAP simulation-results, considering each of the ET 0 calculation approaches in the model input. Soil hydraulic properties, meteorological data, seeding and harvest dates, crop water management and other experimental data were used as SWAP input. As corresponding to the windy and dry conditions found in many Mediterranean landplanes, PT ET 0 values were significantly lower than PM ET 0 calculations. Furthermore, simulated actual evapotranspirations considering the PT approach (PT-ETc) were lower than {{those found in the}} simulations that consider the PM approach (PM-ETc). Correspondingly, simulated drainage flux and soil water contents were higher when the PT ET 0 approach was used. The correlation coefficients between simulated and measured actual maize evapotranspirations and soil water contents were statistically significant, but the same for both ET 0 calculation approaches. Mean and median differences between actual and simulated maize water-use were not statistically different from zero for both considered ET 0 calculation approaches. Experimental data variability was significantly higher than simulated variability. The comparisons among the evaluated irrigation options, made with the experimental water-use data, lead almost to the same conclusions than those achieved from the simulated maize water-use. Considering PM-ETc rather than PT-ETc yields no statistical difference in the modeling-based conclusions. According to the obtained results, the PT approach could be used under Mediterranean conditions for comparative assessments aimed to support irrigation decision-making. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Forecasting of monthly {{and annual}} {{groundwater}} levels {{is important for}} water resources management, <b>irrigation,</b> and <b>assessment</b> of climate change. This study employs entropy spectral analysis for forecasting monthly groundwater levels. For spectral analysis, the domain of consideration for defining entropy is the frequency domain, in which three types of entropies are known: Burg entropy, configurational entropy, and relative entropy. These entropies lead to three types of spectral analysis: (1) Burg entropy spectral analysis (BESA), (2) configurational entropy spectral analysis (CESA), and (3) relative entropy spectral analysis (RESA). BESA, CESA, and RESA are employed to analyze spectra and forecast monthly groundwater levels, and then they are compared to determine which spectral analysis method better forecasts the monthly groundwater level. Monthly and annual groundwater data were obtained from South Carolina to verify the three methods. Both monthly and annual groundwater level data showed significant decreasing trends at almost all stations. It was found that relative entropy yielded the highest resolution in determining the spectral density, while for simulating groundwater levels, all three methods fitted the observed values well. This was indicated by the average value of Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) for BESA, CESA, and RESA being 0. 69, 0. 70, and 0. 70, respectively...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} is conducted {{to develop an}} irrigation fee policy for the Upper Pampanga River Project in the Philippines. Project costs and benefits have been determined and benefit-cost ratios computed for the different phases {{of the project and}} for different combinations of phases. The different phases of the project include the Upper Pampanga River Project, the power phase, the Aurora-Perfaranda Irrigation Project, and the Tarlac Irrigation Systems Improvement Project. The internal rate of return has also been computed in some instances. In this analysis, the irrigation benefit has been evaluated based on the world market price of rice and expressed in terms of "freeon- board" (FOB) and "cost, insurance, and freight" (CIF). The power benefit, on the other hand, has been based on the cost of an alternative thermal plant. Costs are then allocated to various purposes of the project using the separable cost-remaining benefits method. Using the allocated costs, benefit-cost ratios are again determined for irrigation and power purposes. Allocated irrigation benefits have been expressed on a per hectare basis. The values obtained are used as bases for <b>irrigation</b> fee <b>assessment.</b> Another basis for <b>irrigation</b> fee <b>assessment</b> [...] the capability of the farmers to pay [...] turned out to be negative under 1975 circumstances. The farmer's capability to pay was based on a survey of more than 100 farmers for the two crop seasons in 1975. However, at full project development when the potential benefit has been realized, farmer-users should be able to pay all the irrigation costs. While the irrigation fee has just been increased to 300 kg of paddy/hectare/year, which at present is equivalent to 14330 /hectare/year, the research indicates that the National Irrigation Administration should retain this assessment for about five years for the following reasons. 1. Additional irrigation fees should not be assessed the farmers since percentage of collection dropped {{as a result of the}} recent increase in charges. Further, on the basis of the farm budget analysis for 1975, the living expenses of a farm family are greater than the net farm income. 2. Increasing the irrigation fee at this stage is not compatible with the government program of self-sufficiency in food production. 3. Decreasing the irrigation fee is not a sound policy either, since at the present rate there is already a heavy government subsidy. If warranted, further subsidies and incentives could be better accomplished through agricultural reforms, agricultural extension programs, medical and health care, and other government programs. 4. Repayment of the foreign loan is approximately covered by the present irrigation fee charges if all the farmers pay their irrigation fees. The present percentage of collection rate leaves much to be desired. On this basis, several irrigation fee collection alternatives have been investigated. The alternatives that hold promise include the involvement of the Irrigators' Groups, the credit agencies, and the municipal treasury offices...|$|R

A wireless telemetry system was used to collect water use records at the individual field level during two irrigation seasons in the Genil - Cabra Irrigation Scheme (GCIS), Spain. A total of 1365 plots were monitored, encompassing around 7500. ha devoted mainly to wheat, olive, cotton, sunflower, garlic and maize, and served by an on-demand pressurized irrigation system. Substantial variability in field water usage among farmers was detected in the irrigation management of different crops within the GCIS, based on the detailed water use records.

The CWSI of each potential management unit (sectors encompassing about 175 trees) was then calculated and related to the days since last irrigation (DSLI) in F 1 and F 2. The relationship between CWSI and DSLI was established to calculate the average CWSI corresponding to the whole area that was irrigated on the same day. This value was afterward compared with the actual CWSI value of each management unit as a proxy of the spatial variability in CWSI.

However, the evaluation of sprinkler irrigation uniformity using traditional catch can analyses is resource prohibitive and commonly results in only small grids being used to infer whole field performance. A trial was established in a lettuce crop irrigated with a solid set sprinkler system to evaluate the potential to use electromagnetic sensing for <b>irrigation</b> performance <b>assessment.</b> After crop establishment, the uniformity of the irrigation applications was deliberately modified within one sprinkler plot (9 m x 11 m) by reducing the sprinkler operating pressures.

The ECa {{was found to be}} poorly correlated with the applied irrigation depths prior to sprinkler modification when the uniformity of the irrigations was relatively high. However, the correlation improved after sprinkler modification due to the increasing differences in soil moisture. There was generally a poor relationship between the volumes applied at each irrigation and the difference in ECa measured before and after irrigation. However, this relationship was marginally better for the irrigations immediately after sprinkler modification.

30|$|The {{present study}} focused on {{assessing}} the groundwater quality of the shallow aquifer in the northeastern Wasit Governorate, Iraq. The physicochemical parameters, including major cation and anion compositions, pH, total dissolved solid and electrical conductivity, {{were used to assess}} the suitability of groundwater quality for drinking purpose by comparing with the WHO and Iraqi standards. Total dissolved solid (TDS), sodium adsorption ratio, residual sodium bicarbonate, permeability index and magnesium ratio were used for <b>irrigation</b> suitability <b>assessment.</b> For this purpose, 98 samples were collected from the scattered shallow wells in the study area. Results indicated that the spatial distribution of TDS, EC values and major ions in these groundwater samples considerably differ from one site to another mainly due to the lithological variations of the area. The results are correlated with standards classifications to deduce the hydrogeo-chemical phenomena. The dominant factors in controlling the groundwater hydrogeochemistry are evaporation and weathering in the study area. Geochemical modelling approach was used to calculate the saturation state of some selected minerals, i.e., explaining the dissolution and precipitation reactions occurring in the groundwater. The studied groundwater samples were found to be oversaturated with carbonate minerals and undersaturated with evaporates minerals. A comparison of groundwater quality in relation to drinking water standards showed that most of the groundwater samples were unsuitable for drinking purposes. On the other hand, most groundwater is unsuitable for irrigation purposes based on sodium and salinity hazards. However, soil type as well as proper selection of plants should be taken into consideration.|$|R

The objective of this work was to assess seasonal on-farm irrigation performance in the Ebro basin of Spain (0. 8 Â million ha of irrigated land). The study was designed to address the differences between crops and irrigation systems using irrigation district data. Information was only available in districts located in large irrigation projects, accounting for 58 % of the irrigated area in the basin. A total of 1617 records of plot water application (covering 10, 475 Â ha) were obtained in the basin. Average net irrigation requirements (IRn) ranged from 2683 Â m 3 Â ha- 1 in regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) vineyards to 9517 Â m 3 Â ha- 1 in rice. Average irrigation water application ranged from 1491 Â m 3 Â ha- 1 in vineyards to 11, 404 Â m 3 Â ha- 1 in rice. The annual relative irrigation supply index (ARIS) showed an overall average of 1. 08. Variability in ARIS was large, with an overall standard deviation of 0. 40. Crop ARIS ranged between 0. 46 and 1. 30. Regarding irrigation systems, surface, solid-set sprinkler and drip irrigated plots presented average ARIS values of 1. 41, 1. 16 and 0. 65, respectively. Technical and economic water productivities were determined for the main crops and irrigation systems in the Aragón region. Rice and sunflower showed the lowest productivities. Under the local technological and economic constraints, farmers use water cautiously and obtain reasonable (yet very variable) productivities.
