5000|$|Yashica soon {{introduced}} {{several new}} 35mm SLR cameras {{beginning with the}} FX-1 (1975) and FX-2 (1976). Also in that year, {{in response to the}} success of the Contax RTS, Yashica developed the upscale Yashica FR using some of the features of the RTS, including its <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>shutter</b> <b>release.</b> [...] The FR was capable of using the entire range of Carl Zeiss T* lenses. In contemporaneous tests, the FR was described as being tougher in some ways than the more expensive Contax RTS, including better sealing against dust and contaminants. [...] This practice of [...] "pairing" [...] similar Contax models with more affordable, less full-featured, but still high-quality Yashica models would continue for the next ten years. The FR was quickly followed in April 1977 by the FR-I and FR-II. [...] The FR-I was an 35mm SLR offering even more features of the RTS, including an electronic shutter with both manual and aperture priority modes, and marked the high point for the Yashica brand in competing with Nikon, Canon, and Minolta for the semi-professional SLR camera market.|$|E
5000|$|Motivated by {{the huge}} success of the low-priced Canon AE-1 and other consumer-level cameras, Minolta {{followed}} suit in the new camera's design by offering {{a wide array of}} optional equipment for the X-700 such as flashes, film winders, motor drives, data backs etc. This had the effect of lowering the budget for the camera's internal mechanism. In a step backwards, the new X-700 was not equipped with the fast vertical metal shutter of previous XE and XD cameras, and was instead fitted with a less expensive horizontal traverse silk shutter, enabling maximum sync speed of 1/60 second, and operated by an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>shutter</b> <b>release.</b> [...] No mechanical shutter speed was provided, even in bulb mode. The resultant battery drain and inability to meter at light levels below EV-1 made the camera a poor choice for long exposures, as often needed for astrophotography. Minolta further lowered the price of the camera by fabricating certain parts in the film advance and rewind mechanism of less expensive materials, and by the use of less expensive electronic components. Even the rewind lever of the camera is made of plastic.|$|E
50|$|The second {{experiment}} {{was to determine}} the duration of the exposed stimuli to see the illusion. Again, the stimuli were shown to the observer 50 cm away in an ambient lighted room. An <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>shutter</b> was in front of one eye. The smallest interval for the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>shutter</b> was 100 ms, and the continuous color could be seen at the time duration. It was determined that the watercolor illusion could be perceived instantaneously in the given conditions.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Shutter</b> <b>release</b> modes (and film advance) are {{controlled}} by a 4-position switch surrounding the top-mounted <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> button. Positions are: ...|$|R
50|$|AI Servo AF {{was used}} for moving objects. The lens would {{continuously}} refocus on the object in {{the centre of the}} viewfinder whilst the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> button was pressed half-way. Once the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> button was fully pressed, the exposure was calculated then the <b>shutter</b> <b>released.</b>|$|R
50|$|Headphones {{can be used}} as a <b>shutter</b> <b>release.</b> The + (volume up) button acts as a <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> for the camera.|$|R
50|$|<b>Shutter</b> <b>release</b> is {{activated}} by pressing the top-mounted <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> button or by a cable release inserted {{in a standard}} socket located {{on the side of}} the camera.|$|R

5000|$|The {{exposure}} meter's {{mechanical arm}} is retracted by depressing the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> button. As a result, the exposure meter will {{not produce a}} usable reading if the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> button is under any pressure.|$|R
5000|$|When set to bulb, {{generally}} on the [...] "M" [...] or manual {{setting of}} the camera, the shutter will stay open {{as long as the}} <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> button (or <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> cable or remote) remains depressed.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> {{cable or}} self timer {{is almost always}} used to prevent camera shake when the <b>shutter</b> is <b>released.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Drive modes include 10-second self-timer, 2-second delay (in {{the absence}} of remote <b>shutter</b> <b>release),</b> first burst, last burst, 3-shot {{exposure}} bracketing, 5-shot exposure bracketing, time lapse.

5000|$|The term bulb is a {{reference}} to old-style pneumatically actuated shutters; squeezing an air bulb would open the <b>shutter,</b> and <b>releasing</b> the bulb would close it. According to the Focal Encyclopedia of Photography: BULB EXPOSURE (B). Another term for a brief exposure—in which the shutter remains open only {{so long as the}} <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> is held down. The word originated with the early pneumatic <b>shutter</b> <b>release.</b>|$|R

50|$|The shutter of {{the camera}} can be {{released}} in several ways, {{depending on the type}} of camera and complexity of the rig electronics, if used. <b>Shutter</b> <b>release</b> mechanisms include using a radio controlled servo to press the <b>shutter</b> <b>release</b> button, using an infrared signal or wired connection to instruct the camera to <b>release</b> the <b>shutter,</b> or by using the camera's inbuilt intervalometer. Ideally the camera is allowed to reach its final altitude before the <b>shutter</b> is <b>released</b> to avoid taking photos during launch.|$|R
