5|$|Females {{are sexually}} mature at 15–36 months and males at 4–5 years. Mating may occur anytime after {{reaching}} sexual maturity, but is mostly {{seen in the}} rainy season. In Zambia, young are born in July and August, while elsewhere it is the mating season. Mating begins when elands gather to feed on lush green plains with plentiful grass, and some males and females start mating {{with each other in}} separate pairs. Males chase the females to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are in estrus. They also test the female's urine. Usually, a female chooses the most dominant and fit male to mate with. Sometimes she runs away from males trying to mate, causing more attraction. This results in fights between males, in which their hard horns are used. It is 2–4 hours before a female allows a male to mount. Males usually keep close contact with females in the mating period. The dominant male can mate with more than one female. Females have a gestation period of 9 months, and give birth to only one calf each time.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the first}} time, the Hollywood rounds {{were held in}} the Valley Performance Arts Center in Northridge, California. The contestants were {{separated}} by gender, with the male contestants performing in the first week, and the female the next. [...] There were three rounds in each week – the a cappella, the group, and the solo rounds. Unlike previous seasons, the groups in the group round were chosen by the producers, although each group was able to select a song {{from a list of}} twenty songs to perform. The males performed February 6 and 7 and the females performed February 13 and 14. The contestants sang a cappella solos in groups of eight and the judges chose only a few of them to move on to group round that same night and for the first time, the producers picked the groups. On the second night, the contestants performed solos. They were then divided into groups of eight, and only a few of them moved on. The judges picked 20 males and 20 females to perform in front of a live studio audience at The Beatles Love by Cirque De Soleil at The Mirage.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} β-functions of Yukawa and {{electromagnetic}} theories with Lorentz violation (LV) and propose an alternative method {{to find the}} scale dependence of the different fields that parametrize such violations. The method of solution consists of decomposing a family of parameters into their irreducible representations and thus generating a group of subfamilies that obey the same symmetries and transformation rules. This method allows us to decouple the differential equations describing the β-functions and <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> whether <b>they</b> are positive or not. For a set of parameters describing a Lorentz-violating theory, we expect their associated β-functions to be nonnegative or, otherwise, their scale dependence to be weak enough. These conditions rely {{on the fact that}} asymptotically-free parameters can leave high imprints of LV at low energies, which are ruled out by observations. Besides imposing some constrains on the coefficients that describe LV, this method can be used to extract irrelevant coefficients with no scale dependence. Comment: 24 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

To achieve this, we conducted a questionnaire survey. To ensure that the answers are not random, we used X 2 - test.

They also looked at their fathers' occupation, in order to see if the social class they grew up in {{played a role in the}} development of schizophrenia. They found the men had grown up in families whose social class was similar to the general population. So the social class they grew up in did not seem to be a contributor to the development of their schizophrenia.|$|R
6000|$|This was Amos's {{notion of}} the kingdom of God and His righteousness. [...] These Israelites would not obey the laws of God's kingdom, and be righteous and good.

No wonder that the Israelites thought Amos a most troublesome and insolent person. No wonder that the smooth priest Amaziah begged him to begone and talk in that way somewhere else. He saw plainly enough that either Amos must leave Samaria, or he must leave it. The two could no more work together than fire and water. Amos wanted to make men repent of their sins, while Amaziah wanted only to make them easy in their minds; and no man can do both at once.|$|R

No, my friends, we will believe--what every one who loves a beloved friend comes sooner or later to believe--that those whom we have honoured and loved, though taken from our eyes, are near to our spirits; that they still fight for us, under the banner of their Master Christ, and still work for us, by virtue of his life of love, which they live in him and by him for ever.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Methicillin {{resistant}} Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) {{has emerged}} as a nosocomial pathogen of major worldwide importance and is an increasingly frequent cause of community-acquired infections. In this study, different risk factors and MRSA resistance pattern were investigated. Methods: In a 24 months period, all of the patients who were confined to bed in the surgery ward were included in the study. Then they were assessed to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had MRSA infection when hospitalized and once when they were discharged. Almost 48 h after admission, when patients were discharged, social and medical histories were acquired. Acquired samples were examined. Results: During the present study of 475 patients, 108 patients (22. 8 %) had S. aureus. About frequency of antibiotic resistance among collected S. aureus colonies, erythromycin resistance, was the most frequent antibiotic resistance, also resistance to vancomycin was 0. 4 % that was the least. Only hospitalization duration had statistically significant correlation with antibiotic resistance, also resistance to erythromycin had statistically significant relation with history of surgery and alcohol consumption. Of all 34 MRSA species, 22 (64. 7 %) samples were resistant to erythromycin, 17 (50. 0 %) resistant to cefoxitin, 5 (14. 7 %) resistant to mupirocin, 1 (2. 9 %) resistant to vancomycin and 1 (2. 9 %) resistant to linezolid. Conclusion: The results of the current study show that among hospitalized patients, there is resistance against methicillin. Since based on results of the study there is resistance against oxacillin and erythromycin in most cases, administering appropriate antibiotics have an important role in minimizing the resistance burden among bacterial species...|$|R
40|$|Librarians {{must look}} to the future {{information}} needs of a country expanding in population, technology and educational requirements. The "information explosion" is placing an additional strain on existing methods of providing information rapidly and economically. A library seeking to develop a modern information retrieval program has many existing services from which to choose. The problem is to define the program that will best serve the present library users and leave room for flexible action in the future, and then to pick a combination of services that best match these objectives. Documentation Incorporated (Doc Inc) of Bethesda, Maryland, was founded in 1952 by the late Dr. Mortimer Taube, and has been engaged in developing modern information retrieval systems for government and industry. A key concept that is now emerging is the development of mechanized or computerized data banks. This data bank concept is a plan for organizing a single set of data for producing many products. The traditional library card catalog or data bank, long the key to finding materials in the nation's libraries, today is getting competition from book catalogs. Using data bank techniques to keep a library catalog updated, Doc Inc computer systems generate printouts of the catalog which are used to produce bound books for distribution to library users. In effect, the book catalogs are carrying the traditional card catalog, literally, into the homes and offices of users instead of requiring them to trek to the library to <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>if</b> the information <b>they</b> want is available. The computer is used to produce several indexes (such as subject, author, and title) in various formats from a single file of data and is particularly effective if the catalog data bank is standardized. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R
