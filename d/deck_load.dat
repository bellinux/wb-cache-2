25|$|The RN {{was thus}} faced with {{designing}} a carrier {{that would be}} survivable under the conditions to be expected in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Pacific Oceans, and before the development of effective naval radar; these conflicting demands resulted {{in the development of}} aircraft carriers whose decks were armoured against 500lb Armour Piercing bombs and 1000lb General Purpose bombs. The RN considered that an unarmoured carrier would be unlikely to be able fly off more than one <b>deck</b> <b>load</b> of strike aircraft prior to being attacked so the armoured flight deck carriers accepted a reduction in hangar capacity to the equivalent to one <b>deck</b> <b>load</b> of aircraft. USN, IJN some RN Fleet carriers such as Ark Royal had sufficient aircraft capacity to allow for two ranges, each equal to a full <b>deck</b> <b>load</b> of strike aircraft. The RN and IJN limited their aircraft carrier's aircraft capacity to the capacity of their hangars, and struck down all aircraft between operations. The USN, typically, used a permanent deck park to augment the capacity of their aircraft carrier's hangars. The use of a permanent deck park appeared to give USN carriers a much larger aircraft capacity than contemporary RN armoured flight deck carriers. The flight deck armour also reduced the length of the flight deck, reducing the maximum aircraft capacity of the armoured flight deck carrier, however the largest part of the disparity between RN and USN carriers in aircraft capacity was due to the use of a permanent deck park on USN carriers.|$|E
25|$|The next day, the {{submarine}} sighted two ships with an escort. One was a freighter with a <b>deck</b> <b>load</b> of planes, {{and the other}} was a passenger-cargo. Trout fired a spread of three torpedoes at each of the targets. She saw and heard two hits on each. The freighter Ryotoku Maru sank stern first. Though depth charged afterwards and kept down for five hours, Trout surfaced and gave chase to the damaged transport, finding and attacking it with three more torpedoes before her escort could return.|$|E
2500|$|Myron {{averaged}} 12 trips {{a year at}} the end of {{her career}} [...] and she sailed under the flag of O.W. Blodgett Lumber Company, considered the last of the big lumber companies on the Great Lakes. As a lumber hooker, Myron was designed to tow one or two barges and to carry her own <b>deck</b> <b>load</b> to pay her way. She towed big, old converted schooners stripped of their masts and running gear to carry large cargoes. The schooner barge Miztec was the last of Myrons many consorts when she foundered.|$|E

60|$|As an overladen Indiaman {{bearing down}} the Hindostan coast with a <b>deck</b> <b>load</b> of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her way; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk, {{and now and}} then partly turning over on his {{cumbrous}} rib-ends, expose {{the cause of his}} devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin. Whether he had lost that fin in battle, or had been born without it, it were hard to say.|$|E
60|$|My {{appearance}} on deck {{gave rise to}} a great many jokes between the captain of the schooner, and his mate. I was a good deal laughed at, but not badly treated, on the whole. My office was to be that of cook--by no means a very difficult task in that craft, the camboose consisting of two pots set in bricks, and the dishes being very simple. In the cabin, sassafras was used for tea, and boiled pork and beef composed the dinner. The first day, I was excused from entering on the duties of my office, on account of sea-sickness; but, the next morning, I set about the work in good earnest. We had a long passage, and my situation was not very pleasant. The schooner was wet, and the seas she shipped would put out my fire. There was a <b>deck</b> <b>load</b> of shingles, and I soon discovered that these made excellent kindling wood; but it was against the rules of the craft to burn cargo, and my friend the mate had bestowed a few kicks on me before I learned to make the distinction. In other respects, I did tolerably well; and, at the end of about ten days, we entered Sandy Hook.|$|E
60|$|Nothing {{occurred}} {{until we}} got near soundings, when it came on to blow very heavy from the southward and westward. The ship was running under a close-reefed main-topsail and foresail, with a tremendous sea on. Just as night set in, one Harry, a Prussian, came on deck from his supper to relieve the wheel, and, fetching a lurch as he went aft, he brought up against the launch, and thence down against our grass fore-sheet, which had been so great a favourite in the London passages. This rope had been stretched above the <b>deck</b> <b>load</b> for a ridge rope, but, being rotten, it gave way when the poor Prussian struck it, and {{he went into the}} sea. We could do no more than throw him the sky-light, which was large; but the ship went foaming ahead, leaving the poor fellow to his fate, {{in the midst of the}} hissing waters. Some of our people thought they saw poor Harry on the sky-light, but this could not have made much difference in such a raging sea. It was impossible to round-to, and as for a boat's living, it was out of the question. This was the first man I saw lost at sea, and, notwithstanding the severity of the gale, and the danger of the ship herself, the fate of this excellent man made us all melancholy. The captain felt it bitterly, as was evident from his manner. Still, the thing was unavoidable.|$|E

50|$|From a {{structural}} perspective, the second extradosal characteristic is the reduced proportion of superstructure live load that is {{carried by the}} cables. On cable-stayed bridges, the stays commonly support at least 80% of the loading from vehicular traffic acting on the bridge superstructure, whereas on extradosed bridges, the stay cables typically support only between 20% and 60% of this load. In both cases, {{the remainder of the}} load is carried by the longitudinal girder element in spanning-action between the main bridge supports. This characteristic derives from the relative stiffnesses between the cable stays and the girder element. Cable-stay designs typically incorporate flexible deck structures without a stiff girder element, and such systems transfer the majority of any applied <b>deck</b> <b>loads</b> directly into the nearest stay cables. In comparison, extradosal designs utilise a substantially stiffer deck/girder structure, allowing the girder to support a significant proportion of any <b>deck</b> <b>loads,</b> and facilitating the distribution of the remaining load between a larger number of individual stay elements.|$|R
5000|$|Built {{to carry}} RoRo cargoes and containers, the ship {{initially}} had a tonnage of 27,990 GT.

60|$|Thus we kept on {{along the}} gently curving shore, seeing {{two or three}} miles ahead at once,--along this ocean side-walk, where there was none to turn out for, with {{the middle of the}} road the highway of nations on our right, and the sand cliffs of the Cape on our left. We saw this forenoon a part of the wreck of a vessel, {{probably}} the Franklin, a large piece fifteen feet square, and still freshly painted. With a grapple and a line we could have saved it, for the waves repeatedly washed it within cast, but they as often took it back. It would have been a lucky haul for some poor wrecker, for I have been told that one man who paid three or four dollars for a part of the wreck of that vessel, sold fifty or sixty dollars' worth of iron out of it. Another, the same who picked up the Captain's valise with the memorable letter in it, showed me, growing in his garden, many pear and plum trees which washed ashore from her, all nicely tied up and labelled, and he said that he might have got five hundred dollars' worth; for a Mr. Bell was importing the nucleus of a nursery to be established near Boston. His turnip-seed came from the same source. Also valuable spars from the same vessel and from the Cactus lay in his yard. In short the inhabitants visit the beach to see what they have caught as regularly as a fisherman his weir or a lumberer his boom; the Cape is their boom. I heard of one who had recently picked up twenty barrels of apples in good condition, probably a part of a <b>deck</b> <b>load</b> thrown over in a storm.|$|E

5000|$|Historically Whitianga was a centre for boat building, kauri milling, flax milling, gold {{mining and}} gum digging.
