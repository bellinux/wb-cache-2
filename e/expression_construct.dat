5000|$|NdeI {{is useful}} in {{generating}} heterologous DNA construct because it contains the start codon ATG. It therefore can be in used in some expression vectors, {{such as those in}} the pET series of vectors, for the ligation of the start of a gene when making an <b>expression</b> <b>construct.</b> Note however that NdeI generates only a two-base overhang and therefore has a lower melting temperature than other restriction enzymes that generate a four-base overhang. [...] It has a lower ligation efficiency, since ligation is affected by the ability of the ends to anneal and a two-base overhang has a significantly lower melting temperature compared to a 4-base overhang. Ligation of NdeI-generated ends is therefore best performed with higher ligase concentration with a longer ligation time, whether at room temperature, 14-16°C, or at 4°C.|$|E
50|$|The {{neuronal}} ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs) are a {{group of}} inherited neurodegenerative disorders with pathological phenotypes that auto fluorescent lipopigments present in neurons and other cell types. Over the past two decades, accumulating evidences indicates that NCLs are caused by mutations in eight different genes, including genes encoding several soluble proteins (cathepsin D, PPT1, and TPP1). Mutations of gene TPP1 result in late-infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis which {{is associated with the}} failure to degrade specific neuropeptides and a subunit of ATP synthase in the lysosome. Mutations in the TPP1 gene lead to late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, a fatal neurodegenerative disease of childhood. It has been demonstrated that a single injection of intravitreal implantation of autologous bone marrow derived stem cells transduced with a TPP1 <b>expression</b> <b>construct</b> at an early stage in the disease progression could substantially inhibite the development of disease-related retinal function deficits and structural changes.

Besides evaluation and optimization of process parameters (e. g. selection of the best expression host or cell line and optimal induction conditions and time points), {{the design of the}} <b>expression</b> <b>construct</b> itself has a major impact. However, the path to this final <b>expression</b> <b>construct</b> is often not straight forward and includes multiple learning cycles accompanied by design variations and retesting of construct variants, since multiple, functional DNA sequences of the expression vector backbone, either coding or non-coding, can {{have a major impact on}} expression yields. To streamline the generation of defined expression constructs of otherwise difficult to express proteins, the Modular Protein Expression Toolbox (MoPET) has been developed. This cloning platform allows highly efficient DNA assembly of pre-defined, standardized functional DNA modules with a minimal cloning burden. Combining these features with a standardized cloning strategy facilitates the identification of optimized DNA expression constructs in shorter time. The MoPET system currently consists of 53 defined DNA modules divided into eight functional classes and can be flexibly expanded. However, already with the initial set of modules, 792, 000 different constructs can be rationally designed and assembled. Furthermore, this starting set was used to generate small and mid-sized combinatorial expression optimization libraries. Applying this screening approach, variants with up to 60 -fold expression improvement have been identified by MoPET variant library screening...|$|E

A plant-based high fidelity production system is being developed with emphasis on producing antigens capable of being orally delivered to humans in plant packets. To test whether transgenic tobacco, carrot and rice plants can correctly process and assemble the hepatitis-B virus (HBV) core particle/antigen (HBcAg), they were transformed with a C-terminal truncated version of the HBcAg subunit coding sequence. Transgenic tobacco, carrot and rice plants processed the HBV subunits accurately indicating that these recombinant expression systems can be extended to produce other proteins at reduced costs. In the wild-type <b>expression</b> <b>construct</b> (H 1); the enhanced cauliflower mosaic virus double 35 S (CaMV-d 35 S) promoter was fused to the alfalfa mosaic virus RNA 4 (AMV-RNA 4) sequence to achieve greater translation of a C-terminal truncated HBV core particle subunit. A second <b>expression</b> <b>construct</b> (H 2) was plant-codon optimized to match the Arabidopsis thaliana plant genome codon preferences. A third codon-optimized <b>expression</b> <b>construct</b> (H 3) had a KDEL (lysyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-leucine) encoded sequence. While a fourth <b>expression</b> <b>construct</b> (H 4) included an extensin signal sequence in place of the AMV-RNA 4 sequence. Western blotting analysis showed the presence of the HBcAg in transgenic tobacco, carrot and rice plants. The HBcAg levels increased from the H 1 to the H 4 transgenic tobacco lines. Plant codon-optimization of the HBcAg sequence and addition of the KDEL encoded sequence led to higher levels of HBcAg. The most effective modification was observed when the extensin signal sequence replaced the AMV-RNA 4 translation enhancer sequence resulting in the highest observed yields of HBcAg in both the leaves and seeds of the best H 4 tobacco plant. In edible plants, higher levels of HBcAg were observed in carrot roots as opposed to carrot leaves and in rice seeds as opposed to rice leaves. Further analyses via electron microscopy indicated that the HBV subunits had assembled into virus-like particles of 25 [...] 30 nm diameter in all three plant systems.

This suggested that Kiaa 0319 shRNA disrupts neuronal migration by cell autonomous as well as non–cell autonomous mechanisms. Of the Kiaa 0319 shRNA–transfected neurons that migrated into the cortical plate, most migrated to their appropriate lamina. In contrast, neurons transfected with the KIAA 0319 expression vector attained laminar positions subjacent to their expected positions. Neurons transfected with Kiaa 0319 shRNA exhibited apical, but not basal, dendrite hypertrophy, which was rescued by overexpression of KIAA 0319.

40|$|PU. 1 is a tissue-specific {{transcription}} factor that {{is expressed in}} cells of the hematopoietic lineage including macrophages, granulocytes, and B lymphocytes. Bone marrow-derived macrophages transfected with an antisense PU. 1 <b>expression</b> <b>construct</b> or treated with antisense oligonucleotides showed a decrease in proliferation compared with controls. In contrast, bone marrow macrophages transfected with a sense PU. 1 <b>expression</b> <b>construct</b> displayed enhanced macrophage colony- stimulating factor (M-CSF) -dependent proliferation. Interestingly, there was no effect of sense or antisense constructs of PU. 1 on the proliferation of the M-CSF-independent cell line, suggesting that the response was M-CSF dependent. This was further supported by the finding that macrophages transfected with a sense or an antisense PU. 1 construct showed, respectively, an increased or a reduced level of surface expression of receptors for M-CSF. The enhancement of proliferation seems to be selective for PU. 1, since transfections with several {{other members of the}} ets family, including ets- 2 and fli- 1, had no effect. Various mutants of PU. 1 were also tested for their ability to affect macrophage proliferation. A reduction in macrophage proliferation was found when cells were transfected with a construct in which the DNA-binding domain of PU. 1 was expressed. The PEST (proline-, glutamic acid-, serine-, and threonine-rich region) sequence of the PU. 1 protein, which is an important domain for protein-protein interactions in B cells, was found to have no influence on PU. 1 - enhanced macrophage proliferation when an <b>expression</b> <b>construct</b> containing PU. 1 minus the PEST domain was transfected into bone marrow- derived macrophages. In vivo, PU. 1 is phosphorylated on several serine residues. The transfection of plasmids containing PU. 1 with mutations at each of five serines showed that only positions 41 and 45 are critical for enhanced macrophage proliferation. We conclude that PU. 1 is necessary for the M-CSF-dependent proliferation of macrophages. One of the proliferation-relevant targets of this {{transcription factor}} could be the M-CSF receptor...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The ORF 6 {{protein is}} one of the eight {{accessory}} proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Numerous properties of ORF 6 have been documented and this study focuses on two of these, namely, its ability to suppress the expression of co-transfected <b>expression</b> <b>constructs</b> and its subcellular localization to vesicular structures. Results Using a transient transfection system, ORF 6 's ability to suppress the expression of co-transfected <b>expression</b> <b>constructs</b> was measured in a quantitative manner. While ORF 6 does not have a global effect on protein synthesis, quantitative real-time PCR revealed that it down-regulated the mRNA level of the co-transfected myc-nsp 8 gene. Furthermore, alanine substitution of a diacidic cluster motif (aa 53 - 56) in the ORF 6 gene caused a reduction in the suppression of expression of co-transfected myc-nsp 8 gene. Our previous study revealed that ORF 6 localized to vesicular structures in SARS-CoV infected Vero E 6 cells. Here, ORF 6 was observed to be localized to similar vesicular structures in Vero E 6 cells which have been transiently transfected with a mammalian expression plasmid encoding for untagged ORF 6. ORF 6 showed partial colocalization with cellular proteins CD 63 and Lamp 1, suggesting that the vesicular structures may be a subpopulation of endosomal/lysosomal vesicles. The alanine substitution of the diacidic cluster motif also altered the subcellular localization of the ORF 6 protein, indicating a potential relationship between the subcellular localization of the ORF 6 protein and its ability to suppress the expression of co-transfected <b>expression</b> <b>constructs.</b> Conclusions By combining quantitative real-time PCR and transient transfection system, a simple and safe method is established to measure ORF 6 's ability to suppress the expression of co-transfected myc-nsp 8. In addition, immunofluorescence analysis revealed that the subcellular localization of ORF 6 when expressed on its own is similar to that observed in SARS-CoV infected cells.
