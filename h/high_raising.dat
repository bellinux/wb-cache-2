Besides this, in one of the corners, where are the four Evangelists, nude, with books in their hands, it does not seem to me that in a single place did he give a thought to any order of composition, or measurement, or time, or variety in the heads, or diversity in the flesh-colours, or, in a word, to any rule, proportion or law of perspective, for the whole work is full of nude figures with an order, design, invention, composition, colouring, and painting contrived after his own fashion, and with such melancholy and so little satisfaction for him who beholds the work, that I am determined, since I myself do not understand it, although I am a painter, to leave all who may see it to form their own judgement, for the reason that I believe that I would drive myself mad with it, and would bury myself alive, even as it appears to me that Jacopo in the period of eleven years that he spent upon it sought to bury himself and all who might see the painting, among all those extraordinary figures... Wherefore it appears that in this work he paid no attention to anything save certain parts, and of the other more important parts he took no account whatever. In a word, whereas he had thought in the work to surpass all the paintings in the world of art, he failed by a great measure to equal his own (past) works; whence it is evident that he who seeks to strive beyond his strength and, as it were, to force nature, ruins the good qualities with which he may have been liberally endowed by her.(1) ...|$|E

30|$|It {{has also}} been argued that high {{investment}} rate is indispensable for economic growth. However, the growth of output is not the ultimate objective; the growth in consumption {{is more important than}} the growth in output. Raising investment rate can increase output. However, if investment rate is too <b>high,</b> <b>raising</b> investment further will reduce consumption. According to the Solow growth model, the golden rule level of savings rate that maximizes consumption is equal to the capital income share. In China, the average share of capital income in all factor income between 1992 and 2007 was about 38.7  % if we use the data from the 2007 version of the flow of funds table, and was about 43.7  % if we use the GDP account data by the income approach. Both of these two numbers are much lower than the investment rate of 48.6  %. That is, China’s investment rate is much higher than the golden rule level, suggesting that the investment rate is too high for maximizing consumption and so is the savings rate.|$|E

40|$|Terebralia palustris is {{a common}} mud-whelk present at a {{particularly}} high density in all Indo-West Pacific mangroves. Young snails feed on nothing but mud while larger specimens are able to feed on fallen leaves too. In Kenya (Mida Creek) under the canopy, competition for mangrove leaves can be very high due to the high density of Sesarmidae crabs. On open exposed muddy platforms, no Sesarmidae occur but the leaf density is very low because the leaves are only randomly present as they are deposited and removed twice a day by the tide. However, the snail density is always very <b>high,</b> <b>raising</b> {{the question as to}} whether the snails use a special searching strategy to optimize their resource finding rather than a purely random movement. By analyzing the snails' movements on a uniform area at different levels and comparing them with simulated random paths, we could show that the snails' movements are not purely random. The distribution of different size classes of T. palustris in Mida Creek was known to be quite odd: the same simulation approach suggests that the zonation asymmetry could reasonably be due to the stochastic recruitment of juveniles in space and time and maintained by a substantial long-lasting spatial inertia. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of airborne image acquisition systems being equipped with multiple small- or medium size frame cameras are operational. The cameras normally cover different viewing directions. In contrast to vertical images, those oblique images have some specific properties, like a significantly varying image scale, and more occlusion through <b>high</b> <b>raising</b> objects, like buildings. However, the faces of buildings and other vertically extended objects are well visible {{and this is why}} oblique images are used for instance for visualization purposes. This paper shows results from applying the sophisticated Semi-Global-Matching technique to a set of oblique airborne images. The images were acquired by two systems, namely FLI-MAP 400 (Fugro Aerial Mapping B. V.) and Pictometry (BLOM Aerofilms) over the same area. After the joint adjustment of the images, dense matching and forward ray intersection was performed in several image combinations. The disparity maps were evaluated through the comparison with a reference map derived from LIDAR which was acquired in parallel with the FLI-MAP system. Moreover, the 3 D point clouds were analyzed visually and also compared to the reference point cloud. Around 60 to 70 percent of all matches were within a range of ± 3 pix to the reference. Since the images were acquired in different flight configurations, the impact of different intersection angles and baselines to the triangulation is quite obvious. In general, the overall structures on the building faces are well represented, but the noise reduction needs further attention. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{estimate}} HIV prevalence {{in various}} blood donor populations, to identity sociodemographic risk {{factors associated with}} prevalent HIV and to assess the feasibility of offering routine voluntary counselling services to blood donors. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Thyolo district, Malawi. METHODS: Data analysis involving blood donors who underwent voluntary counselling and HIV testing between January 1998 and July 2000. RESULTS: Crude HIV prevalence was 22 %, while the age standardised prevalence (> 15 years) was 17 %. Prevalence was lowest among rural donors, students and in males of the age group 15 - 19 years. There was a highly significant positive association of HIV prevalence with increasing urbanisation. Significant risk factors associated with prevalence for {{both male and female}} donors included having a business-related occupation, living in a semi-urban or urban area and being in the age group 25 - 29 years for females and 30 - 34 years for males. All blood donors were pre-test counselled and 90 % were post test counselled in 2000. CONCLUSIONS: HIV prevalence in blood donors was alarmingly <b>high,</b> <b>raising</b> important concerns on the potential dangers of HIV transmission through blood transfusions. Limiting blood transfusions, use of a highly sensitive screening test, and pre-donation selection of donors is important.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Injury is {{the leading}} cause of death for persons aged 1 - 44 years in the United States. Injuries have a {{substantial}} economic cost. For that reason, regional systems of trauma care in which the more acutely injured patients are transported to Level-I (L-I) trauma centers (TCs) has been widely advocated. However, the cost of TC care is <b>high,</b> <b>raising</b> questions about the value of such an approach. OBJECTIVES: To study L-I TC effectiveness and study return-to-work (RTW) outcomes. RESEARCH DESIGN: Using data from National Study on the Costs and Outcomes of Trauma, the authors address the issue of selection bias by comparing naive estimates to matching techniques, as well as to nonlinear instrumental variable models (2 SRI) and bivariate probit estimators. SUBJECTS: Individuals ages 18 - 64 who were mainly working before traumatic injury. Patients selected for the study were treated at 69 hospitals located in 12 states in the United States. N = 1790. MEASURES: Treatment is binary indicator on whether treated at L-I TC. Outcome is binary indicator on whether returned to work within 3 months after injury. Covariates include: demographics, pre-injury characteristics (job, health and insurance status), injury descriptors, other income sources, etc. RESULTS: Across all models that control for unobserved factors, the authors find that L-I TC treatment is positively associated with RTW within 3 months after injury. The estimated average marginal effect of treatment on the probability of RTW ranges from 23 to 38 percentage points. CONCLUSIONS: Benefits of L-I TC care extend beyond mortality and morbidity...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The cost {{of trauma}} center care is <b>high,</b> <b>raising</b> {{questions}} {{about the value of}} a regionalized approach to trauma care. To address these concerns, we estimate 1 -year and lifetime treatment costs and measure the cost-effectiveness of treatment at a Level I trauma center (TC) compared with a nontrauma center hospital (NTC). METHODS: Estimates of cost-effectiveness were derived using data on 5, 043 major trauma patients enrolled in the National Study on Costs and Outcomes of Trauma, a prospective cohort study of severely injured adult patients cared for in 69 hospitals in 14 states. Data on costs were derived from multiple sources including claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, UB 92 hospital bills, and patient interviews. Cost-effectiveness was estimated as the ratio of the difference in costs (for treatment at a TC vs. NTC) divided by the difference in life years gained (and lives saved). We also measured cost-effectiveness per quality-adjusted life year gained where quality of life was measured using the SF- 6 D. We used inverse probability of treatment weighting to adjust for observable differences between patients treated at TCs and NTCs. RESULTS: The added cost for treatment at a TC versus NTC was $ 36, 319 per life-year gained ($ 790, 931 per life saved) and $ 36, 961 per quality-adjusted life years gained. Cost-effectiveness was more favorable for patients with injuries of higher versus lower severity and for younger versus older patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence that regionalization of trauma care is not only effective but also it is cost-effective...|$|E

In this study, an upstream tailings dam in Northern Sweden wasnumericallysimulated with the finite element software PLAXIS 2 D in order to assess the stability of the dam. Upstream tailings dams are sensitive to <b>high</b> <b>raising</b> rates since initiated excess pore water pressures might not have time to dissipate. Stability analysis of a tailings damis an application that is very suitable to carry out using finite element software; once a finite element model of thecomplex geometry of adam has been established, it is easy to stepwiseadd new soil volumes, associated with each new raising, to the model. In this case study, it was found that strengthening actions were needed in order to maintain a stable structure.

40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{prenatal}} care {{is to promote}} good maternal and foetal health and to identify risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes {{in an attempt to}} promptly manage and solve them. Although high {{prenatal care}} attendance is reported in most areas in Brazil, perinatal and neonatal mortalities are disproportionally <b>high,</b> <b>raising</b> doubts about the quality and performance of the care provided. The objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the adequacy of prenatal care use and the risk factors involved in inadequate prenatal care utilization in the metropolitan area of Aracaju, Northeast Brazil. Methods A survey was carried out with puerperal women who delivered singleton liveborns in all four maternity hospitals of Aracaju. A total of 4552 singleton liveborns were studied. The Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization Index, modified according to the guidelines of the Prenatal Care and Birth Humanization Programme, was applied. Socioeconomic, demographic, biological, life style and health service factors were evaluated by multiple logistic regression. Results: Prenatal care coverage in Aracaju was high (98. 3 %), with a mean number of 6. 24 visits. Prenatal care was considered to be adequate or intensive in 66. 1 % of cases, while 33. 9 % were considered to have inadequate usage. Age < 18 to 34 years at delivery, low maternal schooling, low family income, two or more previous deliveries, maternal smoking during pregnancy, having no partner and prenatal care obtained outside Aracaju were associated with inadequate prenatal care use. In contrast, private service attendance protected from inadequate prenatal care use. Conclusion Prenatal care coverage was high. However, a significant number of women still had inadequate prenatal care use. Socioeconomic inequalities, demographic factors and behavioural risk factors are still important factors associated with inadequate prenatal care use...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Ollier's {{disease is}} a rare nonhereditary {{disorder}} characterized by multiple enchondromas with a predilection for unilateral distribution. Malignant changes in Ollier's disease may occur in adult patients. Radionuclide bone scanning is one method used to assess lesions depicted on radiographs or magnetic resonance images that are presumed to be enchondromas. Also, a bone scan may give {{a clue to the}} multifocal nature of the disease and it has been recommended that scintigraphy is useful in the monitoring of lesions and the development of any malignant transformation. Case presentation A 21 -year-old man with a history of pathologic fractures of the right tibia and multiple limb surgeries related to Ollier's disease was referred to our nuclear medicine department. Radiographic assessment showed multiple radiolucent expansile lesions, suggestive of multiple enchondromas. A whole-body bone (99 m Tc-MDP) scan showed multiple foci of increased activity involving the proximal and distal right femur and tibia, proximal right humerus, distal right ulna, right metacarpals, metatarsals and phalyngeal tubular bones, consistent with unilateral distribution of the lesions. The long bones of the left hemi-skeleton were unremarkable, representing unilateral involvement of the skeleton. In this case, the intensity of uptake in the lesions of the lower extremity was <b>high,</b> <b>raising</b> the possibility of malignant degeneration of the enchondromas. Hence, the patient underwent surgical excision of the suspected lesions. Pathology analysis revealed their benign nature. Conclusion Although the malignant transformation of enchondromas is a well known phenomenon, it should be kept in mind that other etiologies can be considered as the cause of intensely increased uptake. Retrospective assessment of our patient revealed that the etiology of increased uptake in the lower limb lesions was due to previous insufficiency fractures and the possibility of malignant transformation was ruled out based on the pathology findings. </p...|$|E
