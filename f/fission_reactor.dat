5|$|Since that discovery, {{there have}} been many {{searches}} in terrestrial materials for natural sources of technetium. In 1962, technetium-99 was isolated and identified in pitchblende from the Belgian Congo in extremely small quantities (about 0.2ng/kg); there it originates as a spontaneous fission product of uranium-238. The Oklo natural nuclear <b>fission</b> <b>reactor</b> contains evidence that significant amounts of technetium-99 were produced and have since decayed into ruthenium-99.|$|E
5|$|The {{economics}} of fission–fusion designs {{have always been}} questionable. The same basic effect can be created by replacing the central fusion reactor with a specially designed <b>fission</b> <b>reactor,</b> and using the surplus neutrons from the fission to breed fuel in the blanket. These fast breeder reactors have proven uneconomical in practice, and the greater expense of the fusion systems in the fission–fusion hybrid has always suggested they would be uneconomical unless built in very large units.|$|E

5|$|Americium is {{produced}} mostly artificially in small quantities, for research purposes. A tonne of {{spent nuclear fuel}} contains about 100grams of various americium isotopes, mostly 241Am and 243Am. Their prolonged radioactivity is undesirable for the disposal, and therefore americium, together with other long-lived actinides, must be neutralized. The associated procedure may involve several steps, where americium is first separated and then converted by neutron bombardment in special reactors to short-lived nuclides. This procedure is well known as nuclear transmutation, {{but it is still}} being developed for americium. The transuranic elements from americium to fermium occurred naturally in the natural nuclear <b>fission</b> <b>reactor</b> at Oklo, but no longer do so.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the short}} {{half-life}} of all isotopes of einsteinium, any primordial einsteinium, that is einsteinium that could possibly be present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now. Synthesis of einsteinium from naturally occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth crust requires multiple neutron capture, which is an extremely unlikely event. Therefore, all terrestrial einsteinium is produced in scientific laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in nuclear weapons tests, and is present only {{within a few years}} {{from the time of the}} synthesis. The transuranic elements from americium to fermium, including einsteinium, occurred naturally in the natural nuclear <b>fission</b> <b>reactor</b> at Oklo, but no longer do so. Einsteinium was observed in Przybylski's Star in 2008.|$|E

Therefore, most fermium is produced on Earth in scientific laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in nuclear weapons tests, and is present only {{within a few months}} {{from the time of the}} synthesis. The transuranic elements from americium to fermium did occur naturally in the natural nuclear <b>fission</b> <b>reactor</b> at Oklo, but no longer do so.|$|E

5|$|Each fusion {{event in}} the D-T fusion reactor gives off an alpha {{particle}} and a fast neutron with around 14MeV of kinetic energy. This is enough energy to cause fission in U-238, and many other transuranic elements as well. This reaction is used in H-bombs to increase the yield of the fusion section by wrapping it in a layer of depleted uranium, which undergoes rapid fission when hit by the neutrons from the fusion bomb inside. The same basic concept {{can also be used}} with a fusion reactor like LIFE, using its neutrons to cause fission in a blanket of fission fuel. Unlike a <b>fission</b> <b>reactor,</b> which burns out its fuel once the U-235 drops below a certain threshold value, these fission–fusion hybrid reactors can continue producing power from the fission fuel as long as the fusion reactor continues to provide neutrons. As the neutrons have high energy, they can potentially cause multiple fission events, leading to the reactor as a whole producing more energy, a concept known as energy multiplication. Even leftover nuclear fuel taken from conventional nuclear reactors will burn in this fashion. This is potentially attractive because this burns off many of the long lived radioisotopes in the process, producing waste that is only mildly radioactive and lacking most long-lived components.|$|E
25|$|The large flux of high-energy {{neutrons}} in a reactor {{will make}} the structural materials radioactive. The radioactive inventory at shut-down may be {{comparable to that of}} a <b>fission</b> <b>reactor,</b> but there are important differences.|$|E
25|$|A {{molten salt}} reactor (MSR) is {{a class of}} {{generation}} IV nuclear <b>fission</b> <b>reactor</b> in which the primary nuclear reactor coolant, or even the fuel itself, is a molten salt mixture.

50|$|Oklo is {{a region}} {{near the town}} of Franceville, in the Haut-Ogooué {{province}} of the Central African state of Gabon. Several natural nuclear <b>fission</b> <b>reactors</b> were discovered in the uranium mines in the region during 1972.|$|R
25|$|Critical fission {{reactors}} are {{the most}} common type of nuclear reactor. In a critical <b>fission</b> <b>reactor,</b> neutrons produced by fission of fuel atoms are used to induce yet more fissions, to sustain a controllable amount of energy release. Devices that produce engineered but non-self-sustaining fission reactions are subcritical fission reactors. Such devices use radioactive decay or particle accelerators to trigger fissions.|$|E
25|$|Nuclear bombs {{also produce}} very large {{quantities}} of neutrinos. Fred Reines and Clyde Cowan considered the detection of neutrinos from a bomb prior to their search for reactor neutrinos; a <b>fission</b> <b>reactor</b> was recommended as a better alternative by Los Alamos physics division leader J.M.B. Kellogg. Fission bombs produce antineutrinos (from the fission process), and fusion bombs produce both neutrinos (from the fusion process) and antineutrinos (from the initiating fission explosion).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the tests of the weak equivalence principle, the Einstein equivalence principle can be tested by searching for variation of dimensionless constants and mass ratios. The present best limits on the variation of the fundamental constants have mainly been set by studying the naturally occurring Oklo natural nuclear <b>fission</b> <b>reactor,</b> where nuclear reactions similar to ones we observe today {{have been shown to}} have occurred underground approximately two billion years ago. These reactions are extremely sensitive to the values of the fundamental constants.|$|E
50|$|SP-100 (Space reactor Prototype) was a U.S. {{research}} program for nuclear <b>fission</b> <b>reactors</b> usable as small fission power systems for spacecraft. It {{was started in}} 1983 by NASA, the US Department of Energy and other agencies.|$|R
50|$|In the past, the {{geothermal}} {{release of}} decay heat, emitted from {{the decay of}} the isotopes potassium-40, uranium-235 and uranium-238 was considerably greater than it is today. The figure to the right shows that the isotope ratio between uranium-238 and uranium-235 was also considerably different than it is today, with the ratio essentially equivalent to that of modern low-enriched uranium. Therefore, natural uranium ore bodies, if present, would have been capable of supporting natural nuclear <b>fission</b> <b>reactors</b> with common light water as its moderator. Any attempts to explain the paradox must therefore factor in both radiogenic contributions, both from decay heat and from any potential natural nuclear <b>fission</b> <b>reactors.</b>|$|R
40|$|Nuclear Hydrogen Production (NHP) enables {{implementation}} {{of two major}} emission-free hydrogen production techniques- thermo-chemical and electrolytic- using both heat and electricity from nuclear reactors. A significant R&D effort is currently in progress to develop such technologies for fission reactor-based NHP. However, future fusion reactors also constitute a potential source of heat and electricity for this purpose. In addition to enabling all the processes that would be enabled by <b>fission</b> <b>reactors,</b> fusion reactors may also enable some fusion-unique processes. All the NHP schemes being considered for <b>fission</b> <b>reactors</b> today were originally worked out for fusion reactors. Now that construction work on the ITER fusion reactor is finally under way, researchers in the US, Europe and Asia are again seriously looking {{at the possibility of}} NHP from fusion, using both types of fusion reactors (magnetic and inertial confinement). Significant R&D challenges for fusion still remain, but some of these, especially the materials challenges, are also shared with next generation high-temperature <b>fission</b> <b>reactors.</b> Fusion-fission hybrid reactors have also been proposed, as have fusion concepts that produce only hydrogen (and not electricity). This paper outlines some of the technical proposals for fusion-based hydrogen production; and discusses related economic, safety and policy issues, as a contribution to technology foresight in non-fossil hydrogen production technology...|$|R

In the film, Mr. Fusion allows the DeLorean time machine to generate the required 1.21 gigawatts needed to travel to any point in time. The energy produced by Mr. Fusion replaces plutonium as the primary power source of the DeLorean's time travel, allowing the characters to bypass the arduous power-generation requirements upon which {{the plot of the}} first film hinges. The plutonium <b>fission</b> <b>reactor</b> was most likely left installed underneath Mr. Fusion as a backup power source.|$|E
25|$|Although {{nuclear fission}} {{reactors}} are {{often thought of}} as being solely a product of modern technology, the first nuclear fission reactors were in fact naturally occurring. A natural nuclear <b>fission</b> <b>reactor</b> can occur under certain circumstances that mimic the conditions in a constructed reactor. Fifteen natural fission reactors have so far been found in three separate ore deposits at the Oklo uranium mine in Gabon, West Africa. First discovered in 1972 by French physicist Francis Perrin, they are collectively known as the Oklo Fossil Reactors. Self-sustaining nuclear fission reactions took place in these reactors approximately 1.5billion years ago, and ran for {{a few hundred thousand}} years, averaging 100kW of power output during that time. The concept of a natural nuclear reactor was theorized as early as 1956 by Paul Kuroda at the University of Arkansas.|$|E
25|$|Much {{later in}} the history of man, the steam engine came about as the crucial Promethean recipe of the second kind, feeding on coal. With the {{invention}} of the steam engine, it was possible to drain the groundwater flooding the mine shafts, and the mined coal could then be used as fuel for other steam engines in turn. This technology propelled the Industrial Revolution in Britain {{in the second half of}} the 18th century, whereby man's economy has been thrust into a long, never-to-return overshoot-and-collapse trajectory with regard to the Earth's mineral stock. Georgescu lists the internal combustion engine and the nuclear <b>fission</b> <b>reactor</b> as other, later examples of Promethean recipes of the second kind, namely heat engines feeding on a mineral fuel (oil and uranium (plus thorium), respectively).|$|E
50|$|Most <b>fission</b> <b>reactors</b> use {{a neutron}} {{moderator}} to slow down, or thermalize the neutrons that are emitted by nuclear fission {{so that they}} are more easily captured, causing further fission.

50|$|Nuclear <b>fission</b> <b>reactors</b> {{naturally}} produce free neutrons; {{their role}} is to sustain the energy-producing chain reaction.

25|$|In 1950, the Industrial Engineering {{department}} branched {{off from}} the Mechanical Engineering department. In 1956, a Civil Engineering Department was formed under Lehigh University graduate Robert L. Ketter, {{who went on to}} become Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and later President of the University. In 1959, WBFO was launched as an AM radio station by UB's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and run by UB's students. The station has since become the launching pad of two modern National Public Radio personalities: Terri Gross and Ira Flatow. In 1961, the Western New York nuclear research program was created. This program installed a miniature, active nuclear <b>fission</b> <b>reactor</b> on the University's South (Main Street) Campus. This program was not particularly active, nor could it compete with other government-run research labs, consequently, the programs performed in this facility were abandoned somewhat shortly after its inception. This reactor was decommissioned in 2005 with little fanfare due to material security concerns.|$|E
500|$|By 2012, the {{baseline}} {{design of the}} pure fusion concept, known as the Market Entry Plant (MEP), had stabilized.

500|$|Trace {{amounts of}} plutonium-238, plutonium-239, plutonium-240, and plutonium-244 {{can be found}} in nature. Small traces of plutonium-239, a few parts per trillion, and its decay {{products}} are naturally found in some concentrated ores of uranium, such as the natural nuclear <b>fission</b> <b>reactor</b> in Oklo, Gabon. The ratio of plutonium-239 to uranium at the Cigar Lake Mine uranium deposit ranges from [...] to [...] These trace amounts of 239Pu originate in the following fashion: on rare occasions, 238U undergoes spontaneous fission, and in the process, the nucleus emits one or two free neutrons with some kinetic energy. When one of these neutrons strikes the nucleus of another 238U atom, it is absorbed by the atom, which becomes 239U. With a relatively short half-life, 239U decays to 239Np, which decays into 239Pu. Finally, exceedingly small amounts of plutonium-238, attributed to the extremely rare double beta decay of uranium-238, have been found in natural uranium samples.|$|E

Over the past few decades, several <b>fission</b> <b>reactors</b> have been proposed, but these fission systems haven’t been utilized in US space projects as prominently as radioisotope systems have. The Soviet Union, however, launched 31 BES-5 low power <b>fission</b> <b>reactors</b> in their RORSAT satellites utilizing thermoelectric converters between 1967 and 1988.

40|$|Tritium is a {{radioactive}} isotope (half-life = 12. 24 yr) present both in fusion and in <b>fission</b> <b>reactors.</b> It is a weak beta emitter, very noxious for humans when inhaled or ingested. Tritium is a fuel for fusion reactors: D + T → n + He {{and it is}} bred in the blanket through the reactions of the fusion neutrons with the isotopes of lithium. Tritium is also produced in <b>fission</b> <b>reactors</b> through ternary <b>fission</b> and activation, but at a much lesser extent than in fusion devices.

This paper evaluates {{the impact of the}} selection of structural materials for the first wall and blanket in fusion reactors on the global tritium inventory. The potential radiological impact of a hypothetical accidental release to the environment of equal quantities of tritiated materials is estimated and the results compared with those for activated fusion materials and fission product...|$|R
