40|$|Abstract. The {{success of}} the Semantic Web {{research}} is dependent upon the construction of complete and reliable domain ontologies. In this paper we describe an unsupervised framework for domain ontology enrichment based on mining domain text corpora. Specifically, we enrich the hierarchical backbone of an existing ontology, i. e. its taxonomy, with new domain-specific concepts. The framework {{is based on an}} extended model of hierarchical self-organizing maps. As being founded on an unsupervised neural network architecture, the framework can be applied to different languages and domains. Terms extracted by mining a text corpus encode contextual content information, in a distributional vector space. The enrichment behaves like a classification of the extracted terms into the existing taxonomy by attaching them as hyponyms for the nodes of the taxonomy. The experiments reported are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> “Lonely Planet” <b>tourism</b> <b>domain.</b> <b>The</b> taxonomy and the corpus are <b>the</b> ones proposed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> PASCAL ontology learning and population challenge.
