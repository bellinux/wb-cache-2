Long-term memory formation in mammalian species has been demonstrated through a variety of conditioning tasks, however, the nature of long-term memory in fish is less known. In the current study, we explored whether African cichlids (Labidochromis caeruleus) could form memories for food-reinforced stimuli that last for 12 days. During the training sessions, fish were reinforced for approaching an upward drifting line grating. After a rest period of 12 days, fish demonstrated a significant preference for the upward drifting grating. To determine whether this preference could also be reversed, fish were then reinforced for approaching a <b>downward</b> <b>drifting</b> line grating after a 20 -day rest period. When tested 12 days later, {{there were no significant differences}} in preference for either stimulus; however, following a second training period for the downward stimulus, there was a significant preference for the <b>downward</b> <b>drifting</b> grating. This suggests that cichlids are able to form reversible discrimination-based memories for food-reinforced stimuli that remain consolidated for at least 12 days...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the neural representation of broadband, dynamic sounds in Primary Auditory Cortex (AI), we characterize responses using the Spectro-Temporal Response Field (STRF). The STRF describes and predicts the linear response of neurons to sounds with rich spectro-temporal envelopes. It is calculated {{here from the}} responses to elementary "ripples," a family of sounds with drifting, sinusoidal, spectral envelopes [...] the complex spectro-temporal envelope of any broadband, dynamic sound can expressed as the linear sum of individual ripples. The collection of responses to all elementary ripples is the spectro-temporal transfer function. Previous experiments using ripples with <b>downward</b> <b>drifting</b> spectra suggested that the transfer function is separable, i. e., it is reducible into a product of purely temporal and purely spectral functions. Here we compare the responses to upward and <b>downward</b> <b>drifting</b> ripples, assuming separability within each direction, {{to determine if the}} total bi-directional transfer function is fully separable. In general, the combined transfer function for two directions is not symmetric, and hence units in AI are not, in general, fully separable. Consequently, many AI units have complex response properties such as sensitivity to direction of motion, though most inseparable units are not strongly directionally selective. We show that for most neurons the lack of full separability stems from differences between the upward and downward spectral cross-sections, not from the temporal cross-sections; this places strong constraints on the neural inputs of these AI units...|$|R
30|$|The airglow {{enhancement}} of MBW observed at Kototabang {{is caused by}} the ionospheric height decrease, as shown by the ionosonde observation in Fig. 6. The possible mechanisms that cause the height decrease of the ionosphere are <b>downward</b> E×B <b>drift</b> and poleward thermospheric winds. If the observed airglow enhancement was caused by the <b>downward</b> E×B <b>drift,</b> the electric field would be instantly projected onto the northern hemisphere along the geomagnetic field line. As a result, a similar ionospheric height decrease and airglow enhancement should be observed in the northern hemisphere. However, the observed MBW does not exhibit geomagnetic conjugacy. Thus, the MBW and associated ionospheric height decrease are not caused by the electric field.|$|R

50|$|A groyne creates and {{maintains}} a wide area of beach or sediment on its updrift side, and reduces erosion on the other. It {{is a physical}} barrier to stop sediment transport {{in the direction of}} longshore drift (also called longshore transport). This causes a build-up, which is often accompanied by accelerated erosion of the downdrift beach, which receives little or no sand from longshore drift (this is known as terminal groyne syndrome, as it occurs after the terminal groyne in a group of groynes). Groynes add sediment to the beach by capturing <b>downward</b> <b>drift.</b> However, this can cause severe erosion on shorelines downstream from the groyne. If a groyne is correctly designed, then the amount of material it can hold will be limited, and excess sediment will be free to move on through the system.

The instruments of the network (NILU-UV multichannel filter radiometers) can provide measurements of irradiance in the UV and the visible part of the solar spectrum. In this study, first results from the calibration measurements and the quality assurance procedures are presented. The stability of the maximum of spectral response and the full width at half maximum was measured within 0. 5 nm.

40|$|Daytime twin-peak structures, {{also known}} as bite-out or diurnal double-maxima structures, are ionospheric {{phenomena}} in which the diurnal ionospheric trend shows two peaks (instead of the normal one) during the daytime. This study reports on first simultaneous observations of these structures in the Global Positioning System and ionosonde measurements from the southern African and European middle-latitude stations during a mostly quiet geomagnetic condition period of 8 – 13  April  2012, which indicates that their occurrence and therefore driving mechanism(s) may not be localised. It is found that the daytime twin-peak structures generally appear later in the Northern Hemisphere with a 1 – 3  h latency although they propagate mostly equatorward in both hemispheres. Proxies of meridional neutral winds were calculated from available manually scaled ionosonde measurements and used to explore their potential as drivers of the structures. Bite-out events were linked to <b>downward</b> <b>drifts</b> of the vertical component of equivalent neutral winds causing plasma depletions.

Near solar maximum, the evening upward drifts are large, but the downward drifts after the reversal are also large. The Rayleigh-Taylor instability must grow rapidly, reach the strongly nonlinear regime, and rise into the topside F region under the effect of the internal polarization electric fields during the period of upward drifts before it is damped by enhanced ion-neutral collisions as the large <b>downward</b> <b>drift</b> moves the F layer to lower altitudes. Another factor is the neutral density in the atmosphere that increases with the solar flux (Kelley 1989).

They {{found that the}} <b>downward</b> <b>drifts</b> across sunset and the upward drifts across midnight were also consistent with the delay in the appearance of ionospheric irregularities after midnight. Narayanan et al.

They found that the ST occurred later in the night as well implying that the PRE was not the cause of the ST during these times. Additionally, they also found that the STs were not followed by ESFs in about 30 % of the cases indicating that large-scale wave-like structures (LSWS) do not trigger ESFs on all occasions. Narayanan et al. (2017) also found that the plasma bubbles were generated without strong PREs when the ion-neutral collision frequencies possibly dropped significantly during the unusually low solar activity conditions of 2008. Abdu et al. (2006) found that the existence of significant planetary wave (PW) influences on plasma parameters at E- and F-region heights over the equatorial latitudes using airglow, radar, and ionospheric sounding observations. A direct consequence of the PW scale oscillations in the evening electric field is its role in the quiet time day-to-day variability of the ESF/plasma bubble occurrences and intensities.|$|R
40|$|Transient lower esophageal {{sphincter}} (LES) relaxation is {{the major}} mechanism of gastroesophageal reflux. This study uses an established ferret model to evaluate GABAB receptor agonists’ ability to reduce triggering of transient LES relaxations. One hundred sixty manometric/pH studies were performed on 18 conscious ferrets. In untreated animals, intragastric infusion of 25 ml glucose (pH 3. 5) led to 2. 0 ± 0. 6 reflux episodes over the first 30 min. Twenty-nine of forty-seven reflux episodes occurred during transient LES relaxation, and 18 occurred after <b>downward</b> <b>drifts</b> (< 1 mmHg/s) in basal LES pressure. The GABABreceptor agonists baclofen (7 μmol/kg ip), CGP- 44532, and SKF- 97541 (both ED 50 < 0. 3 μmol/kg) reduced reflux episodes and transient LES relaxations. The putative peripherally selective GABAB receptor agonist 3 -aminopropylphosphinic acid (80 – 240 μmol/kg) was ineffective, as was the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol (5 μmol/kg). Baclofen’s inhibition of transient LES relaxations and reflux was unaffected by low-affinity GABAB receptor antagonists CGP- 35348 and CGP- 36742 at 100 μmol/kg but was reversed by higher-affinity CGP- 54626 and CGP- 62349 (0. 7 μmol/kg) or by CGP- 36742 at 200 μmol/kg. Therefore, GABABreceptor inhibition of reflux shows complex pharmacology. Our and other data indicate the therapeutic potential for these drugs. L.

This extremely low solar activity provides an unprecedented opportunity to understand the variability of the Earth's ambient ionosphere.
