5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow forages {{slowly on}} or near the ground by walking or hopping under shrubs or dense grasses. Though it {{occasionally}} forages in weedy areas, it is almost never observed foraging in the open. It has occasionally been observed feeding in branches and low shrubs. During the breeding season, it gleans <b>its</b> <b>food</b> from grasses and low shrubs. However, normally the species obtains <b>its</b> <b>food</b> by either pecking or less frequently scratching at leaf litter. This bird tends to forage in a small family group and in a limited area.|$|E
5|$|Although spiders are {{generally}} regarded as predatory, the jumping spider Bagheera kiplingi gets over 90% of <b>its</b> <b>food</b> from fairly solid plant material produced by acacias {{as part of a}} mutually beneficial relationship with a species of ant.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} whether this species obtains {{all of the}} water it needs from <b>its</b> <b>food</b> or if it must also drink; however, it has been {{observed}} both drinking and bathing in pools of water after rain storms.|$|E

5|$|A highly active predator, {{the river}} otter has adapted to hunting in water, and eats aquatic and semiaquatic animals. The {{vulnerability}} and seasonal availability of prey animals mainly governs <b>its</b> <b>food</b> habits and prey choices. This availability {{is influenced by}} the following factors: detectability and mobility of the prey, habitat availability for the various prey species, environmental factors, such as water depth and temperature, and seasonal changes in prey supply and distribution in correspondence with otter foraging habitat.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{property}} in the village is older than the early 17th century, its layout reflects its development in medieval times as a planned village. Eight toft compartments are discernible {{to the west of}} Main Street, and the outline of the four surrounding common fields, now divided, may be identified from the pattern of dry stone walls. The fields were largely arable, providing the village with most of <b>its</b> <b>food</b> requirements, but are now farmed exclusively for pasture and hay. The village manor house was on land now occupied by Hebden Hall {{at the south end of}} Main Street.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Arab Revolt and its aftermath, Aleppo's {{political}} elite was divided between those who embraced the Arab nationalist movement led by Faisal and those who sought political autonomy for Aleppo and its hinterland within the Ottoman state. A number of factors distinguished the attitudes of Aleppo's elite and populace from those of Damascus. For one, the economic well-being of Aleppo's inhabitants was dependent on open, commercial access to Aleppo's Anatolian hinterland, which was predominantly populated by Turks; southwestern Anatolia was the principal market for Aleppo's goods and the principal supplier of <b>its</b> <b>food</b> and raw materials.|$|E

5000|$|Separate {{from the}} NSRI, {{a number of}} major food {{producers}} have pledged to reduce the sodium content of their food. Pepsi is developing a [...] "designer salt" [...] that's slightly more powdery than the salt it regularly uses. The company hopes this new form of salt will cut sodium levels by 25 percent in its Lay's potato chips.Nestl√©'s prepared foods company, which produces frozen meals, announced that it will reduce sodium in <b>its</b> <b>foods</b> by 10 percent by 2015.General Mills announced that it will reduce the sodium content of 40 percent of <b>its</b> <b>foods</b> by about 20 percent by 2015. A number of chain restaurants have made pledges to lower sodium over time. MenuStat, a free online database of past and current nutrition data from chain restaurants developed by the NYC Health Department, is available to monitor and evaluate these pledges.|$|R
5|$|Brachiosaurus is {{the first}} dinosaur seen by the park's visitors. It is inaccurately {{depicted}} as chewing <b>its</b> <b>food,</b> and standing up {{on its hind legs}} to browse among the high tree branches. According to artist Andy Schoneberg, the chewing was done to make the animal seem docile, in a way it resembled a cow chewing its cud. The dinosaur's head and upper neck was the largest puppet without hydraulics built for the film. Despite scientific evidence of their having limited vocal capabilities, sound designer Gary Rydstrom decided to represent them with whale songs and donkey calls to give them a melodic sense of wonder. Penguins were also recorded {{to be used in the}} noises of the dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Breeding pairs {{must have}} a {{territory}} of their own before they begin nest-building and reproduction, and thus aggressively defend a territory and <b>its</b> <b>food</b> resources. Nesting territories vary in size according to the density of food resources in the area. The nest is a deep bowl made of large sticks and twigs, bound with an inner layer of roots, mud, and bark and lined with a softer material, such as deer fur. The nest is usually placed in a large tree or on a cliff ledge, or less frequently in old buildings or utility poles.|$|E
5|$|During the day, tammars {{stay close}} to scrub for shade and move out to more open {{grassland}} by nightfall. Like all macropods, the tammar is herbivorous. They are known to both graze and browse, but the latter is less effective, as they commonly drop leaves when chewing on them. When eating large leaves, tammars handle them with their forelimbs. This species spends more time chewing <b>its</b> <b>food</b> than other similar sized macropods, which likely aids digestion. Tammars commonly feed on acacia seeds. Other species consumed include heart-leaved poison (Gastrolobium bilobum), small-flowered wallaby grass (Austrodanthonia setacea), and marri (Corymbia calophylla). Tammars survive on several islands that have no fresh water, subsisting on seawater and the moisture in plants.|$|E

However, it is better known for <b>its</b> <b>food</b> stalls in the evening, which sell local street food. It is named after the Hindu saint Baba Maneknath. Parts of Ahmedabad are known for their folk art. The artisans of Rangeela pol make tie-dyed bandhinis, while the cobbler shops of Madhupura sell traditional mojdi (also known as mojri) footwear. Idols of Ganesha and other religious icons are made in huge numbers in the Gulbai Tekra area. The shops at the Law Garden sell mirror work handicraft.|$|E
5|$|Other {{researchers}} {{hypothesize that}} another alternative growth strategy will evolve in the P. rebeli, {{in which the}} P. rebeli will parasitize the M. schencki ants for an even {{longer period of time}} than the slow developing larvae. Most researchers, however, find this hypothesis highly unlikely because it is not an evolutionarily stable strategy. At the rate the P. rebeli parasitizes the M. schencki ants, the host colony is unlikely to last as a viable food source {{for more than two years}} (the average lifespan of the longer polymorph of P. rebeli). Once the host colony reaches its lifespan of two years and dies, the P. rebeli loses <b>its</b> <b>food</b> source and dies as well.|$|E
5|$|The Central American {{squirrel}} monkey is omnivorous. Its diet includes insects and insect larvae (especially grasshoppers and caterpillars), spiders, fruit, leaves, bark, flowers and nectar. It also eats small vertebrates, including bats, birds, lizards and tree frogs. It finds <b>its</b> <b>food</b> foraging through the lower and middle {{levels of the}} forest, typically between fifteen and thirty feet high. Two-thirds to three-quarters of each day is spent foraging for food. It has difficulty finding its desired food late in the wet season, when fewer arthropods are available.|$|E

5|$|The {{collapse}} of the Hananu Revolt marked a significant turning point in Aleppo's political configurations. Whereas prior to the revolt, many in Aleppo's political elite were aligned with Turkish national politics, the betrayal that Aleppo's leaders felt at the withdrawal of Turkish support prompted most of them to embrace and pursue a shared destiny {{with the rest of}} Syria. Many were also influenced by Hananu's support for Syrian unity and strengthening ties with Damascus. In the aftermath of the Franco-Turkish accords, Aleppo's Anatolian hinterland, the major market for its goods and the supplier of <b>its</b> <b>food</b> and raw materials, was ceded to Turkey. This effectively severed commercial relations between Aleppo and Anatolia, harming the former's economy.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficult}} {{habitat and}} retiring {{nature of the}} invisible rail mean that information on its lifestyle is sparse, and there are few confirmed sightings. Recorded food items include sago shoots and insects. It also feeds at cut sago plants, although {{it is unclear whether}} it is eating the decaying plant or searching for other edible items. It swallows small stones, as do all rails, to help break up <b>its</b> <b>food</b> in the gizzard.|$|E
5|$|The fin whale's body is {{long and}} slender, {{coloured}} brownish-grey with a paler underside. The fin whale is a large baleen whale that belongs to the Cetacean order, which includes all species of whale, dolphin and porpoise. At least two recognized subspecies exist, in the North Atlantic and the Southern Hemisphere. It is found in all the major oceans, from polar to tropical waters. It is absent only from waters close to the ice pack at the poles and relatively small areas of water away from the open ocean. The highest population density occurs in temperate and cool waters. <b>Its</b> <b>food</b> consists of small schooling fish, squid, and crustaceans including copepods and krill.|$|E

5|$|The olive baboon also {{actively}} hunts prey, {{from small}} rodents and hares to foxes and other primates. Its limit is usually small antelope, such as Thomson's gazelle and also, rarely, sheep, goats, and live chickens, which may amount to 33.5% of <b>its</b> <b>food</b> from hunting. Hunting {{is usually a}} group activity, with {{both males and females}} participating. Interestingly, this systematic predation was apparently developed recently. In a field study, such behavior was observed as starting with the males of one troop and spreading through all ages and sexes.|$|E
5|$|The {{survival}} {{of a living}} organism depends on the continuous input of energy. Chemical reactions {{that are responsible for}} its structure and function are tuned to extract energy from substances that act as <b>its</b> <b>food</b> and transform them to help form new cells and sustain them. In this process, molecules of chemical substances that constitute food play two roles; first, they contain energy that can be transformed and reused in that organism's biological, chemical reactions; second, food can be transformed into new molecular structures (biomolecules) that are of use to that organism.|$|E
5|$|White-bellied sea eagles feed alone, in pairs, or {{in family}} groups. A pair may {{cooperate}} to hunt. Prey can be eaten while {{the bird is}} flying or when it lands on a raised platform such as its nest. The white-bellied sea eagle skins the victim as it eats it. It is exceptionally efficient at digesting <b>its</b> <b>food,</b> and disgorges only tiny pellets of fragmented bone, fur and feathers.|$|E
