50|$|A <b>Formal</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Identifier</b> (FPI) {{is a short}} {{piece of}} {{specially}} formatted text {{that may be used}} to uniquely identify a product, specification or document. One of their most common uses is as part of document type definitions, but they are also used in the vCard and iCalendar formats to identify the software product that has generated data.|$|E
50|$|The FPI is {{undoubtedly}} the least well-understood {{part of the}} document type declaration, an integral component of valid HTML, XML and Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) documents. The <b>Formal</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Identifier's</b> effect upon its host document is unusual in that it can depend not only upon its own syntactical correctness and the behaviour of the program parsing it, but also upon the ISO-registration status of the organisation responsible for schema referenced by the FPI.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} DOCTYPE is syntactically invalid, {{containing the}} <b>public</b> <b>identifier</b> keyword [...] "PUBLIC" [...] but no <b>public</b> <b>identifier</b> (indicating {{the name of}} the version of HTML in use), and no system identifier URL of an HTML Document Type Definition. This would trigger quirks mode: ...|$|R

50|$|The system {{identifier}} {{part of the}} DOCTYPE, which in these examples is the URL that begins with http://, need only point to {{a copy of the}} DTD to use, if the validator cannot locate one based on the <b>public</b> <b>identifier</b> (the other quoted string). It {{does not need to be}} the specific URL that is in these examples; in fact, authors are encouraged to use local copies of the DTD files when possible. The <b>public</b> <b>identifier,</b> however, must be character-for-character the same as in the examples.|$|R
50|$|If the XML {{document}} type declaration includes any SYSTEM identifier for the external subset, it can't be safely processed as standalone: the URI should be retrieved, otherwise {{there may be}} unknown named character entities whose definition {{may be needed to}} correctly parse the effective XML syntax in the internal subset or in the document body (the XML syntax parsing is normally performed after the substitution of all named entities, excluding the five entities that are predefined in XML and that are implicitly substituted after parsing the XML document into lexical tokens). If it just includes any <b>PUBLIC</b> <b>identifier,</b> it may be processed as standalone, if the XML processor knows this <b>PUBLIC</b> <b>identifier</b> in its local catalog from where it can retrieve an associated DTD entity.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{document}} type declarations are slightly different in SGML-based documents such as HTML, where the <b>public</b> <b>identifier</b> {{may be associated}} with the system identifier. This association might be performed, e. g., by means of a catalog file resolving the FPI to a system identifier.|$|R
50|$|Notations {{are also}} {{completely}} opaque for XML and SGML parsers, {{so they are}} not differentiated {{by the type of}} the external entity that they may reference (for these parsers they just have a unique name associated to a <b>public</b> <b>identifier</b> (an FPI) and/or a system identifier (a URI)).|$|R
5000|$|External {{entities}} {{refer to}} external storage objects. They are just declared by a unique {{name in the}} document, and defined with a <b>public</b> <b>identifier</b> (an FPI) and/or a system identifier (interpreted as an URI) specifying where {{the source of their}} content. They exist in fact in two variants: ...|$|R
50|$|In HTML and XML, {{a system}} {{identifier}} is a fragmentless URI reference. It typically {{occurs in a}} Document Type Declaration. In this context, {{it is intended to}} identify a document type which is used exclusively in one application, whereas a <b>public</b> <b>identifier</b> identifies a document type that may span more than one application.|$|R
50|$|The system {{identifiers}} {{of these}} DTDs, if {{present in the}} DOCTYPE, are URI references. A system identifier usually points to {{a specific set of}} declarations in a resolvable location. SGML allows mapping <b>public</b> <b>identifiers</b> to system identifiers in catalogs that are optionally available to the URI resolvers used by document parsing software.|$|R
