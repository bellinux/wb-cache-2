5|$|Despite {{the name}} fisher, {{the animal is}} not known to eat <b>fish.</b> <b>The</b> name is instead related to the word fitch, meaning a European polecat (Mustela putorius) or pelt thereof, due to the {{resemblance}} to that animal. The name comes from colonial Dutch equivalent fisse or visse. In the French language, the pelt of a polecat is also called fiche or fichet.|$|E
5|$|In many vertebrates, the {{esophagus}} is lined by stratified squamous epithelium without glands. In <b>fish,</b> <b>the</b> esophagus is often lined with columnar epithelium, and in amphibians, sharks and rays, the esophageal epithelium is ciliated, helping to wash food along, {{in addition to}} the action of muscular peristalsis. In addition, in the bat Plecotus auritus, fish and some amphibians, glands secreting pepsinogen or hydrochloric acid have been found.|$|E
5|$|In most <b>fish,</b> <b>the</b> {{esophagus}} {{is extremely}} short, {{primarily due to}} the length of the pharynx (which is associated with the gills). However, some fish, including lampreys, chimaeras, and lungfish, have no true stomach, so that the esophagus effectively runs from the pharynx directly to the intestine, and is therefore somewhat longer.|$|E
50|$|With <b>the</b> <b>Fish</b> Symbol feature disabled, an angler {{can learn}} to {{distinguish}} between fish, vegetation, schools of baitfish or forage fish, debris, etc. Fish will usually appear on the screen as an arch. This is because the distance between <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> and <b>the</b> transducer changes as the boat passes over <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> (or <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> swims under <b>the</b> boat). When <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> enters <b>the</b> {{leading edge of the}} sonar beam, a display pixel is turned on. As <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> swims toward <b>the</b> centre of the beam, the distance to <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> decreases, turning on pixels at shallower depths. When <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> swims directly under the transducer, it is closer to the boat so the stronger signal shows a thicker line. As <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> swims away from the transducer, the distance increases, which shows as progressively deeper pixels.|$|R

5|$|In {{ovoviviparous}} <b>fish</b> <b>the</b> eggs develop {{inside the}} mother's body after internal fertilization but receive {{little or no}} nourishment directly from the mother, depending instead on the yolk. Each embryo develops in its own egg. Familiar examples of ovoviviparous fish include guppies, angel sharks, and coelacanths.|$|E
5|$|Like chondrostean <b>fish,</b> <b>the</b> major immune {{tissues of}} bony fish (or teleostei) include the kidney (especially the {{anterior}} kidney), which houses many different immune cells. In addition, teleost fish possess a thymus, spleen and scattered immune areas within mucosal tissues (e.g. in the skin, gills, gut and gonads). Much like the mammalian immune system, teleost erythrocytes, neutrophils and granulocytes {{are believed to}} reside in the spleen whereas lymphocytes are the major cell type found in the thymus. In 2006, a lymphatic system {{similar to that in}} mammals was described in one species of teleost <b>fish,</b> <b>the</b> zebrafish. Although not confirmed as yet, this system presumably will be where naive (unstimulated) T cells accumulate while waiting to encounter an antigen.|$|E

5000|$|In fishing, a gaff is a pole {{with a sharp}} hook on the {{end that}} is used to stab a large fish and then lift <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> into <b>the</b> boat or onto shore. Ideally, the hook is placed under the backbone. Gaffs are used when the weight of <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> exceeds <b>the</b> {{breaking}} point of <b>the</b> <b>fishing</b> line or <b>the</b> <b>fishing</b> pole. A gaff cannot be used if it is intended to release <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> unharmed after capture, unless <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> is skilfully gaffed in the lip, jaw, or lower gill using a thin gaff hook.|$|R

5|$|A {{long-lived}} fish, adult Murray cod are carnivorous and mainly eat other <b>fish.</b> <b>The</b> species {{exhibits a}} high degree of parental care for their eggs, which are spawned in the spring and are generally laid in hollow logs or on other hard surfaces. Murray cod are a popular angling target and aquaculture species. Often available through the aquarium trade, they are also a popular aquarium species in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Adults of Diphyllobothrium infest fish, and the juveniles use copepod {{crustaceans}} as intermediate hosts. Excreted proglottids {{release their}} eggs into the water, and the eggs hatch into ciliated, swimming larvae. If a larva is swallowed by a copepod, it sheds the cilia {{and the skin}} becomes a syncitium and the larva makes {{its way into the}} copepod's hemocoel (internal cavity that is {{the main part of the}} circulatory system) and attached itself with three small hooks. If the copepod is eaten by a <b>fish,</b> <b>the</b> larva metamorphoses into a small, unsegmented tapeworm, drills through to the gut and becomes an adult.|$|E

5|$|Although zinc is an {{essential}} requirement for good health, excess zinc can be harmful. Excessive absorption of zinc suppresses copper and iron absorption. The free zinc ion in solution is highly toxic to plants, invertebrates, and even vertebrate <b>fish.</b> <b>The</b> Free Ion Activity Model is well-established in the literature, and shows that just micromolar amounts of the free ion kills some organisms. A recent example showed 6 micromolar killing 93% of all Daphnia in water.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Khmer Rouge {{initiated}} their dry-season offensive to capture the beleaguered Cambodian capital on 1 January 1975, the Republic was in chaos. The economy had been gutted, the transportation network {{had been reduced to}} air and water systems, the rice harvest had been reduced by one-quarter, and the supply of freshwater <b>fish</b> (<b>the</b> chief source of protein) had declined drastically.

5|$|During {{the process}} of {{catching}} the commercialized <b>fish,</b> <b>the</b> Amazon river dolphins {{get caught in the}} nets and exhaust themselves until they die, or the local fishermen deliberately kill the dolphins that become entangled in their nets. The carcasses are discarded, consumed, or used as bait to attract a scavenger catfish, the piracatinga (Calophysus macropterus). The use of the Amazon river dolphin carcass as bait for the piracatinga dates back from 2000. The increasing consumption demand by the local inhabitants and Colombia for the piracatinga has created a market for distribution of the Amazon river dolphin carcasses to be used as bait throughout these regions.|$|E

5|$|Each {{chromatophore}} contains pigment of {{only one}} colour. In fish and frogs, colour change is mediated {{by the type of}} chromatophores known as melanophores that contain dark pigment. A melanophore is star-shaped; it contains many small pigmented organelles which can be dispersed throughout the cell, or aggregated near its centre. When the pigmented organelles are dispersed, the cell makes a patch of the animal's skin appear dark; when they are aggregated, most of the cell, and the animal's skin, appears light. In frogs, the change is controlled relatively slowly, mainly by hormones. In <b>fish,</b> <b>the</b> change is controlled by the brain, which sends signals directly to the chromatophores, as well as producing hormones.|$|E
5|$|Early {{fish from}} the fossil record are {{represented}} {{by a group of}} small, jawless, armored fish known as ostracoderms. Jawless fish lineages are mostly extinct. An extant clade, the lampreys may approximate ancient pre-jawed <b>fish.</b> <b>The</b> first jaws are found in Placodermi fossils. The diversity of jawed vertebrates may indicate the evolutionary advantage of a jawed mouth. It is unclear if the advantage of a hinged jaw is greater biting force, improved respiration, or a combination of factors.|$|E
5|$|Exceptionally heavy {{rainfall}} in November 2012 caused a major {{break in the}} Grand Western Canal's banks, near Halberton, necessitating nearby homes to be evacuated. Two temporary dams were installed which allowed {{the rest of the}} canal to remain open and meant the horse drawn barge at Tiverton was able to run throughout the summer of 2013. Around 400 fish were returned to the canal from a flooded field but many fish including pike, eels, perch, bream, tench and roach were lost. About 25 people from the Environment Agency and Tiverton Angling Club assisted with saving the <b>fish.</b> <b>The</b> Environment Agency restocked the canal with 3,000 fish in January 2013 and by May the Environment Agency said they were flourishing.|$|E
