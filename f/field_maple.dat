5|$|Walton and Ivythorn Hills {{are covered}} {{by a variety of}} {{semi-natural}} habitats. These include unimproved calcareous grassland, scrubland and coppiced woodland including <b>field</b> <b>maple</b> and Ash. The range of habitats are home to many species of invertebrate. Butterflies, Leafhoppers, Spiders and Soldier Flies are particularly well represented. There is also a population of Great Green Bush Cricket (Tettigonia viridissima).|$|E
5|$|The larvae of {{a number}} of species of moth use the leaves as a food source. These include the {{sycamore}} moth (Acronicta aceris), the maple prominent (Ptilodon cucullina) and the plumed prominent (Ptilophora plumigera). The horse-chestnut leaf miner (Cameraria ohridella) occasionally lays its eggs on the sycamore, although 70% of the larvae do not survive beyond the second instar. The leaves attract aphids, and also the ladybirds and hoverflies that feed on them. The flowers produce copious amounts of nectar and pollen and are attractive to bees and other insects, and the seeds are eaten by small mammals such as voles and birds. As an introduced plant, in Britain the sycamore has a relatively small associated insect fauna of about 15 species, but it does have a larger range of leafhoppers than does the native <b>field</b> <b>maple.</b>|$|E
50|$|Apterygida {{media is}} thought to have been a common insect in the hop gardens of Kent until the {{introduction}} of pesticides. It is now found chiefly in warm hedges and woodland edges, particularly on <b>field</b> <b>maples</b> (Acer campestre).|$|R

5000|$|It is {{an ancient}} woodland, {{dominated}} by pedunculate oak, hornbeam and ash. A shrub layer includes hawthorns, <b>field</b> <b>maples</b> and wild service trees, and among the ground flora are bluebells and wood anemones. Breeding birds include tawny owls, nuthatches, tree creepers and stock doves. A small stream flows through the wood to join Pymme's Brook, {{which is also a}} Site of Importance for Nature Conservation, in the neighbouring Oak Hill Park.|$|R
25|$|The {{planting}} programme of the 1940s was principally of oak, {{but also}} larch, Scots pine and Corsican pine. Unlike in a coppice-with-standards rotation, Bedford Purlieus woodland {{is much more}} even in age. However, when an ancient woodland is cleared and planted the result {{is not just a}} monoculture of the newly planted trees. The canopy is now a mix of the planted trees, self-sown trees and shrubs, and regrowth of coppice stools, some probably of more recent origin, other stools clearly dating back to antiquity. The species diversity that characterises the woods was thus retained, and oak, lime, large-leaved elm, hazel, ash, <b>field</b> <b>maple,</b> English elm, sycamore, chestnut and birch are all to be found in substantial quantities.|$|E
25|$|Westminster Abbey, {{founded in}} AD 960, has a {{particular}} status and {{is known as a}} Royal Peculiar. Although the abbey has been the traditional location for coronations since 1066, not until the 20th century did it become the church of choice for royal weddings; prior to 1918, most royal weddings took place in the royal chapels, such as the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace and St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle. The abbey, which has a usual seating capacity of 2000, has been the venue for most royal weddings in the last century, including those of Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II) to the Duke of Edinburgh in 1947, Princess Margaret to Antony Armstrong-Jones (later the Earl of Snowdon) in 1960, Princess Anne (later the Princess Royal) to Mark Phillips in 1973, and the Duke of York to Sarah Ferguson in 1986. A prominent decorative addition inside the abbey for the ceremony was an avenue of 20-foot tall trees, six <b>field</b> <b>maple</b> and two hornbeams, arranged {{on either side of the}} main aisle.|$|E
25|$|The nearby meadows at Plaster's Green Meadows are {{designated}} as a Site of Special Scientific Interest {{because it is an}} area of unimproved and traditionally managed species-rich meadows which support a neutral grassland community of a type which is now rare throughout Britain. The site is situated on the slopes fringing the Lias Tablelands and is underlain by Rhaetic clays and, lower down the slope Keuper Red Marl. The slowly permeable clay soils are slightly calcareous in nature and this is reflected in elements of the flora. The site is characterised by the nationally rare Common Knapweed (Centaurea nigra) and Crested Dog’s-tail (Cynosurus cristatus) and dominant grasses include Sweet Vernal-grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), Crested Dog’s-tail and Yorkshire Fog (Holcus lanatus), while Quaking Grass (Briza media) and Yellow Oat-grass (Trisetum flavescens) are also frequent. There is a high component of herb species throughout the meadows including Saw-wort (Serratuta tinctoria), Dyer’s Greenweed (Genista tinctoria), Common Knapweed, Pepper-saxifrage (Silaum silaus), Devil’s-bit Scabious (Succisa pratensis), Betony (Stachys officinalis) and Spiny Restharrow (Ononis spinosa). The calcareous nature of the soil is reflected by the presence of Cowslip (Primula veris), Fairy Flax (Linum catharticum), Glaucous Sedge (Carex flacca), Lady’s Bedstraw (Galium verum) and occasional Salad Burnet (Sanguisorba minor). The meadows are bounded by hedges supporting numerous species including Hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), Wych Elm (Ulmus glabra), English Elm (Ulmus procera), Hazel (Corylus avellana) and <b>Field</b> <b>Maple</b> (Acer campestre). Hedgerow trees include Ash (Fraxinus excelsior), Sweet Chestnut (Castanea sativa), Holly (Ilex aquifolium) and Oak (Quercus sp).|$|E
50|$|The {{common is}} mostly wooded, {{dominated}} by pedunculate oak, with some hornbeam, beech and <b>field</b> <b>maples.</b> Holly forms a dense understorey in some places, while elsewhere {{a more diverse}} shrub layer includes Midland hawthorn and hazel. Several ground flora species are ancient woodland indicators, suggesting that fragments have survived from before {{the time when the}} common was managed as wood-pasture. Butterflies include white-letter and purple hairstreaks, and there are breeding birds such as sparrowhawk and tawny owl.|$|R

50|$|Portuguese oaks can {{be found}} near the humid sectors around the rivers and acquire their maximum splendor in the {{limestone}} areas between the villages of Korres and Bujanda and also around Arlucea. As they are young trees their conservation is precarious. These trees are typical in subhumid climates with a 600 - 900 mm per year precipitation and short summer droughts. As they need to stand in a fresh ground with a good liquid retention capacity, they usually occupy clayey and marly grounds. Under 650 m the Portuguese oak is substituted by the Mediterranean oaks. Groups of downy oaks, <b>field</b> <b>maples</b> and European hollys can also be found. The oaks are the wood's 15.35% occupying an area of 1.12 ha.|$|R
500|$|The {{sycamore}} {{gall mite}} Eriophyes macrorhynchus produces small red galls, {{similar to those}} of the nail gall mite Eriophyes tiliae, on leaves of sycamore and <b>field</b> <b>maple,</b> Acer campestris from April onwards. [...] Another mite, Aceria pseudoplatani causes a 'sycamore felt gall' on the underside of leaves of both sycamore and Norway maple (Acer platanoides). The sycamore aphid Drepanosiphum platanoidis sucks sap from buds and foliage, producing large quantities of sticky honeydew that contaminate foliage, cars and garden furniture beneath.|$|E
500|$|It {{produces}} a hard-wearing, white or cream close-grained timber that turns golden with age.

40|$|Background and Purpose: Eutypella parasitica, a plant {{pathogenic}} fungus attacking maples (Acer spp.) {{was detected}} {{for the first}} time in Croatia in 2007. From 2007 to 2014, it was found only in forests, on several trees in Hum na Sutli, near Slovenian border. In 2015, the presence of Eutypella parasitica was monitored {{for the first time}} in urban areas. Materials and Methods: Within the official survey programme, 23 visual surveys were conducted and 24 samples were collected and analysed for the presence of fungi. E. parasitica was found in Bundek Park in Zagreb. Typical symptoms of Eutypella canker were detected on two <b>field</b> <b>maples</b> (Acer campestre) and two boxelder maples (Acer negundo). Twelve isolates were collected from symptomatic trees. Conclusions: Eleven out of twelve isolates from four trees were confirmed as E. parasitica by species-specific polymerase chain reaction. This is the first report of E. parasitica in Zagreb, the first record of E. parasitica in Croatia outside forests, as well as a record of a new host species in Croatia, boxelder maple (A. negundo). Introduction pathway of E. parasitica in Zagreb remains unknown...|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of the {{construction}} of the original dam, the region was inhabited almost exclusively by Ojibwa Indians, who had lived on the shores of this part of the river for many generations, as documented by the explorer, Henry Schoolcraft. The United States Army Corps of Engineers used 2,000,000 board-feet (4720 cubic meters) of pine for the dam and related buildings, wiping out large sections of conifer forests. Along the shores were the Ojibwa's hay <b>fields,</b> <b>maple</b> trees, gardens, cranberry marshes, wild rice marshes, villages, and burial mounds. A staple in their diet was fish, which they caught with nets placed in the swift and shallow river current. Construction of the dam raised the water level by 14 ft, not only obliterating the natives' homes and history, but also wiping out their fisheries. Recent archeological research has shown that the burial mounds and ceramic fragments dated from 700 - 1000 ce. The construction of this dam was a significant milestone in the historical record of white, Western European settlers, Christian missionaries, and commercial interests eradicating the indigenous population from most of Minnesota.|$|R

40|$|Natural {{medicines}} {{and the use}} of botanical extracts in the prevention and treatment of ailments is globally gaining interest (Mazzio and Soliman, 2009). Detrimental side effects may be reduced using natural therapies (Desai et al., 2008). Worldwide, there are about 120 different maple species. Of those, thirteen are native to eastern North America (<b>Maple</b> <b>Field</b> Guide, 2002). <b>Maple</b> syrup is a natural sweetener derived from collected and concentrated maple tree sap. It takes about 40 liters of sap to make one liter of syrup. Maple plant parts have been used by Native Americans for medicinal purposes. The University of Rhode Island’s Bioactive Botanical Research Laboratory (BBRL) has evaluated the biological activities of maple parts including maple leaves, bark, sap, and syrup. Results include α-glucosidase inhibition, -one of the several strategies of diabetes management, from red maple (Acer rubrum) stems (Wan, et al. 2012) and the antiproliferative effects on colon cancer cells (González-Sarrías et al,. 2012) of compounds isolated from maple sap and syrup.

40|$|Potato {{leafhopper}} Empoasca fabae (Harris) (Homoptera: Cicadellidae) {{and maple}} spider mite Oligonychus aceris (Shimer) (Acarina: Tetranychidae) are important pests of maple trees. Investigations determined how insecticide use and fertilization impacted {{the abundance of}} E. fabae and O. aceris on `Red Sunset 2 ̆ 7 red maple and `Autumn Blaze 2 ̆ 7 Freeman maples. Bifenthrin applications directed against leafhoppers reduced damage to both cultivars, but increased O. aceris on Autumn Blaze. Using a threshold of one leafhopper per branch to trigger pesticide applications protected Red Sunset maples from leafhopper injury. It also prevented outbreaks of O. aceris on Autumn Blaze because few trees reached this density. Two phytoseiid mites, Neoseiulus fallacis (Garman) and Typhlodromus caudiglans (Schuster) (Acarina: Phytoseiidae), and one stigmaeid, Zetzellia mali (Ewing) (Acarina: Stigmaeidae) were identified as predators of O. aceris on maple leaves. Populations of Z. mali were higher in both years on Red Sunset than Autumn Blaze. Fertilizer applications on <b>field</b> grown <b>maples</b> increased populations of leafhoppers and spider mites. More damage by E. fabae was observed on fertilized Red Sunset than on fertilized Autumn Blaze trees. O. aceris populations were higher on fertilized Autumn Blaze than fertilized Red Sunset trees. O. aceris populations were positively correlated with nitrogen content in the leaves in both cultivars. Mite populations increased at a lower rate with increasing concentration of nitrogen in the leaves of Red Sunset than on those of Autumn Blaze maples. Differences {{may be explained by}} a greater abundance of Z. mali (Ewing) on Red Sunset maples. In laboratory experiments N. fallacis consumed significantly more protonymphs and adults of O. aceris, whereas Z. mali consumed more eggs. N. fallacis consumed more Z. mali on Autumn Blaze than on Red Sunset maple. Z. mali consumed fewer N. fallacis on both maple cultivars than O. aceris. Leaf domatia on Red Sunset leaves provide refugia for Z. mali predators. Absence of leaf domatia on Autumn Blaze left Z. mali no place to hide from N. fallacis and diminished their contribution to O. aceris mortality Thus, differential susceptibility of these cultivars to spider mites is mediated by the capacity of leaf domatia to influence intraguild predation among phtyoseiid and stigmaeid predators...|$|R
