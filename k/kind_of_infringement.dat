John Paul II states, [...] "These techniques, insofar as they involve the manipulation and destruction of human embryos, are not morally acceptable, even when their proposed goal is good in itself." [...] Thus, according to the Catholic ethical system, even a good that might come from therapeutic cloning would be morally unacceptable, as it would be the result of an act which, according to Catholics, is itself intrinsically immoral. This, for many Christians, is hard to abide by, for, as one Professor of Christian Ethics states, [...] "our society is preoccupied with death and the pursuit of health seems to justify anything." ...|$|E
50|$|In South Africa {{personality}} rights are protected under the South African law of delict and the Bill of Rights, which also provides {{for freedom of}} expression and freedom of association. After much uncertainty concerning the recognition of image rights in South Africa, the Supreme Court of Appeal provided clarity in the landmark case of Grütter v Lombard. In South Africa, a person's right to identity is violated if the attributes of that person is used without permission {{in a way which}} cannot be reconciled with the true image of that person. Apart from the unauthorized use of a person's image, this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> also entails some kind of misrepresentation concerning the individual, such as that the individual approves or endorses a particular product or service or that an attorney is a partner in a firm, while this is not the case. Secondly, the right to identity is violated if the attributes of a person is used without authorization by another person for commercial gain. Apart from the unauthorized use of the individual's image, such use also primarily entails a commercial motive which is exclusively aimed at promoting a service or product or to solicit clients or customers. The mere fact that the user may benefit or profit from any product or service in respect of which the individual's attributes have incidentally been used, is not in itself sufficient. This violation of the right to identity therefore also entails unauthorized use of the individual's attributes with a commercial purpose, whether it is done by means of advertisement or the manufacture and distribution of merchandise covered with the attributes of the individual. Personality rights are not absolute and {{it goes without saying that}} the use of a person's attributes must be unlawful before a plaintiff will succeed with any claim. With the use of a person's image, the {{personality rights}}, privacy, human dignity and freedom of association of the individual must often be weighed against the user's right to freedom of expression. The use of a person’s image can be justified on the grounds of consent, truth and public interest, fair comment and jest.|$|E

Out of these videos, considerable numbers of videos are illegal copies or some videos are manipulated versions of existing media. Due to these reasons copyright management on the internet becomes a complicated process. To detect such <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>infringements,</b> there are two approaches. First is based on watermarking and other is based on content-based copy detection (CBCD). Video copy detection system relies on a fingerprint extraction algorithm. The fingerprint extraction algorithm extracts compact content- based signatures from special images constructed from the video. Each such image represents a short segment of the video and contains temporal as well as spatial information about the video segment. These images are denoted by temporally informative representative images. Existing video fingerprint extraction algorithms have certain limitations. Therefore temporally informative representative images- discrete cosine transform (TIRI-DCT) is developed. TIRI-DCT is based on temporally informative representative images which contains spatial and temporal information of a short segment of a video sequence...|$|R
40|$|Molecular markers {{facilitate}} {{rapid and}} environment-neutral {{characterization of the}} pattern of genetic diversity. The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) at Patancheru, India, has developed a large number and diverse range of maintainer lines (B-lines) and restorer lines (R-lines) of pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br. ] in last three decades. In the present study, 213 lines (98 B-lines and 115 R-lines) were genotyped using high throughput assay and 38 polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, which detected 308 alleles averaging 8. 1 alleles per locus. Restorer lines were genetically more diverse than B-lines, as higher average gene diversity was detected among R-lines (0. 62) than among B-lines (0. 50). A neighbor-joining tree based on simple matching dissimilarity distance matrix clearly differentiated B-lines from R-lines into two clusters, with further subdivision of B-lines into four subclusters and R-lines into five subclusters. Seven B-lines clustered with R-lines, and only two R-lines clustered with B-lines. Few unique alleles (1 to 3) were detected in 14 B- and 30 R-lines, {{which could be used}} to distinguish them from each other {{as well as from the}} remaining lines used in this study. The SSR alleles of each of the parental lines along with distinctness, uniformity, and stability (DUS) characterization may enable ICRISAT to protect these lines from any <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> by the multiple users who have received these lines for hybrid development.

40|$|Although a map is {{protected}} by the Act on copyrights and related rights (ZASP) there are still serious problems referring to copyright prevailing in practice. The paper presents an overview of institutions and organisations dealing with copyrights in the Republic of Croatia and the comparison made between copyright for cartographic works and other copyrights (musical works, architectural works, works of art and industrial design and audiovisual arts) the protection and usage of which is regulated by additional regulations. There are also the examples of maps given a s original copyright work protected by ZASP, then the map as original copyright work not protected by ZASP, and at the of the map not being a copyright work. Studying of available data about legal proceedings and verdicts in the Republic of Croatia {{has shown that the}} infringement of copyrights in the field of cartography is not a rare case. The most frequent infringements of copyrights in cartography are connected with the usurpation of authorship, permitted usage of copyright, publishing of maps without quoting the author, electronic and other map copying…. and the works of commercial cartography are mostly exposed to this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>infringement.</b> If there should be any judicial proceedings it is usually not the problem of defining the violation of individual cartographer's copyright, but the problem of defining the height of compensation. We therefore suggest the establishment of standards for the evaluation of cartographic works, which would significantly contribute to copyright protection in the field of cartography. The Act on libraries is also paid attention to in the work. The delivery of an «obligatory copy » to the National and University Library would establish a unique base of published cartographic works, and thus a more easy definition of copyright violation...|$|E

40|$|This work {{analyzes}} the Italian tax offences’ system, regulated by d. lgs. n. 74 / 2000, and underlines how {{the urgent need}} for "fiscal security" has influenced the most recent legislative and court decisions involving criminal tax matters. It is generally known, how the negative value of economic crimes – and consequently of fiscal crimes – is not fully perceived by citizens, because those <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>infringements</b> are considered as events far away from their individual needs. For this reason they are not fully highlighted by the medias which are more interested in pursuing other areas of judicial chronicle. For this reason, criminal law of economics – historically characterized by a certain degree of specialty area to the general rules laid down by the penal code – saw sectoral reforms, sometimes ending up to real forms of decriminalization, which are not justified given the importance of the legal protected asset. Criminal tax law, in an apparent alienation from other areas of criminal law, had the uneasy task to protect tax interests, after abandoning the offences repression logic of the tax evasion in the previous law n. 516 / 1982. Legislative power, in accordance with doctrine, had decided to split tax evasion in two main categories: 1) the so-called "great evasion", mainly considered in criminal cases contained in d. lgs. n. 74, regards unlawful conduct, in particular detrimental tax interests; 2) the so-called "small and medium evasion" on tax discipline breaches subject to administrative sanctions. Although decreasing tax income, this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> evasion would not be detrimental to public finances as criminal tax evasion would be. However this elaborate system – certainly in conformity with the General principles – doesn't seem to have reached the desired results. The current unfavourable economic environment has highlighted the limits of tax legislation and, consequently, of its related sanctions, despite the innovations that have improved the efficiency of financial Administration. Therefore, in an attempt to fight tax evasion there has been a dual outcome: a) on one hand, jurisprudence has extensively interpreted criminal law, getting to use in some cases the analogy in malam partem of penal precept; b) on the other hand, legislators have recently intervened by modifying the original structure of the above cited decree n. 74, setting new cases and heavier sanctions. These initiatives although sharable in their goal, raise doubts in the doctrine. The aim of this writing is to illustrate the evolution of criminal tax matters, with a particular focus on how the legislative power and the jurisprudence have reformulated, in terms of penalties, some of the institutes and cases contained in d. lgs. n. 74 / 2000...|$|R
50|$|Since {{a patent}} right {{is also a}} <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> {{property}} right, an act <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> a patent right constitutes a tort, and a patentee who sustains damages {{as a result of}} an act <b>of</b> <b>infringement</b> may demand damages from the infringer in tort (Article 709 of the Civil Code). Unlike an ordinary tortious act however, in the case <b>of</b> the <b>infringement</b> <b>of</b> a patent right, it is often difficult to prove the amount of the loss, as well as intent or negligence on the part of the infringer. For that reason, the Patent Act contains a special provision for calculating the amount of loss (Article 102), a provision on the presumption of negligence (Article 103), and a provision permitting the determination of a reasonable amount of loss (Article 105-3).|$|R

The characters in the movie “Revolutionary Road” expressed their apologies with the simple and complex form of apology strategies both directly and indirectly. They also delivered their apologies in high tone and low tone. They also showed nonverbal expressions in apologizing. The apology strategies were influenced by the degree of severity of the offence and the response given by the addressee. The employing of apology strategy in apologizing was influenced by the social distance, the formality of the situation, and the social status of the participants. It is implied that the speech act of apology in different contexts including movies should be regarded and considered by sociolinguistics...|$|R
