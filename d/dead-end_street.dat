5|$|West of I-87, {{the route}} crosses the Blue Line of Catskill Park and becomes the Onteora Trail. Although still four lanes wide, the route {{is no longer}} a limited-access highway as it has an {{at-grade}} intersection with Modica Lane, a local <b>dead-end</b> <b>street,</b> just west of where it passes over the Thruway. Not long afterward, the highway meets US209 by way of a cloverleaf interchange. Past US209, the highway enters a rural area as it heads northwest {{into the center of the}} state park.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, {{construction}} {{began on}} the Keeler Street Expressway, a limited-access highway extending across Irondequoit from the Genesee River (at the Veterans Memorial Bridge) to the Sea Breeze Expressway. The first section from North Goodman Street to the Sea Breeze Expressway was completed by 1968 while the remainder opened in late 1969. The name of the expressway was derived from Keeler Street, a small residential street that originally connected to East Ridge Road and St. Paul Street {{by way of a}} traffic circle on the east bank of the Genesee River. The street was turned into a <b>dead-end</b> <b>street</b> {{as a result of the}} expressway's construction. US104 was moved from East Ridge Road to the expressway, which remains known, albeit infrequently, as the Keeler Street Expressway to this day. NY18 remained on East Ridge Road, however, reducing the overlap between US104 and NY18 to just the portion on the Veterans Bridge. NY18 was truncated to its current eastern terminus , eliminating the overlap entirely.|$|E
50|$|This grid {{is mostly}} {{retained}} in modern-day Hazel Park neighborhoods, but has had significant modifications. <b>Dead-end</b> <b>streets</b> became increasingly {{common in the}} northeast area of the city after the construction of Karam Park and Longfellow Elementary school, which cut off primarily the streets stemming off of Vassar Avenue north of Woodward Heights Boulevard. Multiple other facilities have contributed to creating <b>dead-end</b> <b>streets,</b> including Webster Elementary, Ford Elementary and Saint Justin's Catholic Church.|$|R

The property lay dormant for many years until it was purchased by a local artist in the mid-1950s for conversion to a private residence. The building still retains most of the original details including the two original passenger platforms. The original driveway and turn around for the station has been converted to a <b>dead-end</b> <b>street.</b>|$|E
25|$|At {{that time}} Carlism was {{increasingly}} paralyzed by tension between its top theorist Vazquez de Mella and the claimant Don Jaime; Domínguez was counted among {{supporters of the}} former. According to some historians he considered orthodox Carlism a <b>dead-end</b> <b>street</b> given the Carlist dynasty was already certain to extinguish. He shared de Mella’s vision of a grand extreme-right coalition, which would be new possibilist reincarnation of Traditionalism; he also considered sort of transfer of legitimist rights to the Alfonsine dynasty. However, at the 1919 moment of breakup he decided to stay loyal to Don Jaime, even given discrepancies {{between him and his}} king were already public.|$|E
25|$|Route184 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with Route287 in the hamlet of Brookside. The route progresses to the northeast, heading through {{the rural areas}} of Cogan House Township. Route184 continuously winds through the woods before forming a short eastward pattern after the intersection with Corgi Cabin Lane. The highway clears {{of the woods and}} enters fields. There, the route turns to the northeast at an intersection with Harman Road, a <b>dead-end</b> <b>street</b> to a local farm. Route184 passes a large patch of woods to the east and enters the hamlet of White Pine. In White Pine, the highway passes some residences and intersects with Lick Run Road, where the route makes an abrupt turn to the east through farms. At the intersection with Campbell Road, Route184 turns to the north along the right-of-way of Campbell Road, while the original eastward route continues as Cogan House Road. Farms continue as the scenery for a couple miles as the highway heads north into the hamlet of Beech Grove. In Beech Grove, Route184 makes several curves before heading eastward until the intersection with Taylor Road, where the highway turns to the northeast and enters the hamlet of Steam Valley. Through Steam Valley, Route184 returns to the woods and starts passing numerous residences before entering the interchange with U.S. Route15 (the Appalachian Thruway). Midway through the interchange, the road reaches the northbound on-off ramps, where Route184 continues north past a parking lot and terminates at Steam Mill Road.|$|E

30|$|Unfortunately, the {{proliferation}} of <b>dead-end</b> <b>streets</b> and excessive compartmentalization of modern subdivisions exacerbated accessibility problems and created dysfunctional suburban regions. The result was not only decreased car travel along subdivision streets but also diminished walking and biking opportunities. Pedestrians or cyclists can hardly access modern subdivision different sections without having to backtrack from <b>dead-end</b> <b>streets.</b> The desire to eliminate foreign traffic and limit movement on subdivision streets created highly underutilized internal subdivision streets and unnecessary traffic problems along major arteries. The accessibility criterion advanced by this study is grounded in a balanced understanding of the merits of traditional neighborhood planning and the nuances of modern suburban development practices. Developers commonly cater to prevailing buyer preferences.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Dead-end</b> <b>streets</b> also {{appeared}} during the classical period of Athens and Rome. The 15th century architect and planner Leon Battista Alberti implies in his writings [...] that <b>dead-end</b> <b>streets</b> {{may have been used}} intentionally in antiquity for defense purposes. He writes: [...] "The Ancients in All Towns were for having some intricate Ways and turn again Streets or loops, without any Passage through them, that if an Enemy comes into them, he may be at a Loss, and be in Confusion and Suspense; or if he pushes on daringly, may be easily destroyed". The same opinion is expressed by an earlier thinker, Aristotle, when he criticized the Hippodamian grid. He writes: [...] "... but for security in war arrangement is more useful if it is planned in the opposite manner, {{as it used to be}} in ancient times. For that arrangement is difficult for foreign troops to enter and find their way about when attacking." ...|$|R

As explained by the Second Circuit in its decision below, Harry Tompkins—a citizen and resident of Pennsylvania, was walking next to the Erie Railroad's Erie and Wyoming Valley Railroad tracks in Hughestown, Pennsylvania, at 2:30 a.m. on July 27, 1934. A friend of Tompkins had driven him to within a few blocks of his home, which was located on a <b>dead-end</b> <b>street</b> near the tracks. [...] Tompkins chose to walk the remaining distance on a narrow but well-worn footpath adjacent to the tracks. [...] A train approached, and in the darkness an object protruding {{from one of the}} cars suddenly struck Tompkins knocking him to the ground. [...] When he fell down, his right arm was crushed beneath the wheels of the train.|$|E
2500|$|The route {{continues}} {{into the}} small hamlet, one of many communities located along Ridge Road. NY14 joins the old road for one block westward before leaving Alton to the north. From Ridge Road north to Lake Road in Sodus Point, NY14 {{is part of the}} Seaway Trail, a National Scenic Byway. This stretch of NY14 heads due north across cultivated fields for [...] before curving to the northwest to avoid Sodus Bay. At this point, the farmlands are gradually replaced by waterside homes and communities as NY14 closes in on the bay's shoreline. It reaches the water's edge as it enters Sodus Point, where it initially follows South Fitzhugh Street. At Lake Road, the Seaway Trail heads west to follow the southern edge of Lake Ontario while NY14 turns east onto Bay Street. After three blocks, Bay Street gives way to Greig Street, a <b>dead-end</b> <b>street</b> leading out onto a peninsula protruding into the mouth of Sodus Bay. The street and the route both end in a cul-de-sac at the east end of the peninsula.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the 18th century, {{the stages}} of the largest fairs, the Foire Saint-Germain and Foire Saint-Laurent, were the places to see popular entertainment, {{pantomime}} and satirical songs. They were only open {{for a short period}} of time each year, and were strictly controlled by the rules of the Royal Academy of Music. In 1714-15, the Academy was short of money, and decided to sell licenses to producers of popular theater. The Comédiens-Italiens, expelled from Paris under Louis XIV, were invited back to Paris to perform satirical songs and sketches on the stage at the Hôtel de Bourgogne. In 1726, a new [...] company, the Opéra-Comique, made up of performers from the Saint-Germain fair, was formed. It first settled near the fair on rue de Buci, then moved to the <b>dead-end</b> <b>street</b> cul de sac des Quatre-Vents. Some of the most famous popular French singers of the period and the playwright Charles-Simon Favart made their debut there. In 1744, the Opéra-Comique was taken over by an ambitious new director, Jean Monnet, who built a new theater at the Saint-Laurent fair, with decorations by the famed artist François Boucher, and an orchestra of eighteen musicians conducted by Jean-Philippe Rameau. In 1762, the two competing comic opera theaters were merged under a royal charter, and were allowed to perform all year long, not just during the fairs. The two groups first performed independently on the stage at the Hôtel de Bourgone, and engaged the best composers of the time, including Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny, François-André Danican Philidor and André Grétry. In 1783, they built a brand-new theater, between rues Favart, Marivaux, and the future boulevard des Italiens. The new theater, called Salle Favart, opened on April 28, 1783, in the center of what soon became the city's main theater district.|$|E
