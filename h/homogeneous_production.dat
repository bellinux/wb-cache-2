50|$|Economies {{of scale}} {{is related to}} and can easily be {{confused}} with the theoretical economic notion of returns to scale. Where economies of scale refer to a firm's costs, returns to scale describe the relationship between inputs and outputs in a long-run (all inputs variable) production function. A production function has constant returns to scale if increasing all inputs by some proportion results in output increasing by that same proportion. Returns are decreasing if, say, doubling inputs results in less than double the output, and increasing if more than double the output. If a mathematical function is used to represent the production function, and if that production function is homogeneous, returns to scale are represented by the degree of homogeneity of the function. <b>Homogeneous</b> <b>production</b> functions with constant returns to scale are first degree homogeneous, increasing returns to scale are represented by degrees of homogeneity greater than one, and decreasing returns to scale by degrees of homogeneity less than one.|$|E
5000|$|The Smile {{sessions}} were intentionally limited to recording short interchangeable fragments {{also referred to}} as [...] "modules". With [...] "Good Vibrations", Wilson further expanded his modular approach to recording, experimenting with compiling the finished track by editing together the numerous sections from multiple versions recorded at the lengthy tracking sessions. Instead of taping each backing track as a more-or-less complete performance—as had been the model for previous Beach Boys recordings—he split the arrangement into sections, recording multiple takes of each section and developing and changing the arrangements and the production as the sessions proceeded. He sometimes recorded the same section at several different studios, to exploit the unique sonic characteristics or special effects available in each. Then, he selected the best performances of each section and edited these together to create a composite which combined the best features of production and performance. This meant that each section of the song was presented in its own distinct sonic envelope, rather than the <b>homogeneous</b> <b>production</b> sound of a conventional [...] "one take" [...] studio recording. The cut-up structure and heavily edited production style of Smile was unique for its time in mainstream popular music, and to assemble an entire album from short musical fragments was a relatively bold undertaking.|$|E

The concentrations of HONO, CO, SO 2, O- 3, NO, NO 2, NO (x) were 1. 45 ppbv, 0. 61 ppmv, 8. 7 ppbv, 4. 3 ppbv, 44. 4 ppbv, 37. 4 ppbv, 79. 4 ppbv and 0. 72 ppbv, 1. 00 ppmv, 1. 2 ppbv, 7. 9 ppbv, 3. 7 ppbv, 8. 2 ppbv, 11. 9 ppbv, in urban and suburban areas, respectively. To compare possible pathways of HONO formation in both sites, the contributions of direct emissions, heterogeneous formations, and <b>homogeneous</b> <b>productions</b> were studied. HONO/NO 2 ratios in the two sites indicated that heterogeneous reactions of NO 2 were more efficient in suburban areas. And in both urban and suburban areas, the increase of PM 2. 5 concentrations and RH would promote the conversion efficiency in RH that ranged from 0 % to 85 %. However, when RH was above 85 %, the HONO formation slowed down. Moreover, the study of direct emissions and homogeneous reactions showed that they contributed to a majority of HONO increase in urban areas than the 20 % contributions in suburban areas. It implied that the high NO (x) concentrations and NO concentrations in urban areas or in pollution periods would make direct emissions and homogeneous reactions become dominant in HONO formations...|$|R
