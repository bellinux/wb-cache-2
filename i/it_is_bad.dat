The Liberal Party opposes the deal, saying <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> for the province because it will increase the province's debt and will see electricity rates increase for consumers.

25|$|A soldier whose {{business}} is murder {{as a fine}} art, a diplomat whose calling is based on deception and secretiveness, a politician whose very life consists in compromises with his conscience, a business man whose aim is personal profit within the limits allowed by a lenient law—such may be excused if they set patriotic deception above common everyday decency and perform services as spies. They merely accept the code of morality to which modern society still conforms. Not so the scientist. The very essence of his life is the service of truth. We all know scientists who in private life do not {{come up to the}} standard of truthfulness, but who, nevertheless, would not consciously falsify the results of their researches. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> enough if we {{have to put up with}} these, because they reveal a lack of strength of character that is liable to distort the results of their work. A person, however, who uses science as a cover for political spying, who demeans himself to pose before a foreign government as an investigator and asks for assistance in his alleged researches in order to carry on, under this cloak, his political machinations, prostitutes science in an unpardonable way and forfeits the right to be classed as a scientist.|$|E

500|$|Pneumonia {{has been}} a common disease {{throughout}} human history. The word is from Greek πνεύμων (pneúmōn) meaning [...] "lung". The symptoms were described by Hippocrates (c. 460 BC – 370 BC): [...] "Peripneumonia, and pleuritic affections, are to be thus observed: If the fever be acute, and if there be pains on either side, or in both, and if expiration be if cough be present, and the sputa expectorated be of a blond or livid color, or likewise thin, frothy, and florid, or having any other character different from the common... When pneumonia is at its height, the case is beyond remedy {{if he is not}} purged, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> if he has dyspnoea, and urine that is thin and acrid, and if sweats come out about the neck and head, for such sweats are bad, as proceeding from the suffocation, rales, and the violence of the disease which is obtaining the upper hand." [...] However, Hippocrates referred to pneumonia as a disease [...] "named by the ancients". He also reported the results of surgical drainage of empyemas. Maimonides (1135–1204 AD) observed: [...] "The basic symptoms that occur in pneumonia and that are never lacking are as follows: acute fever, sticking pleuritic pain in the side, short rapid breaths, serrated pulse and cough." [...] This clinical description is quite similar to those found in modern textbooks, and it reflected the extent of medical knowledge through the Middle Ages into the 19th century.|$|E

[...] Ikaros has six zinc fingers domains, four are conserved DNA-binding domain and two are for dimerization.

[...] Wieczoek gave a mixed review on the detail of the artwork in this, [...] sized, edition, stating, [...] "It is good because the panels are just beautiful to look at. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> because the size of the manga causes the panels within to be very small, and some of these panels are just crammed with detailed artwork.

The position in the diagram on the right arose in the game Samuel Reshevsky versus Fotis Mastichiadis, Dubrovnik 1950. Reshevsky played 24.Nd2?, and saw at once that he is put into a very bad situation with 24...Nxf2. Thinking quickly, he offered his opponent a draw, who was busy writing down the move in his scoresheet. Mastichiadis, a minor master, {{was so happy to}} get half a point against his illustrious opponent that he did not pause to examine the position before accepting the offer.|$|E
2500|$|The {{names of}} University of Arkansas students, {{starting}} with the first senior class of 1876, are carved {{into one of the}} concrete walkways or sidewalks on campus. This tradition was started by the 1905 graduating class of students, who drew their names into the walkway in front of Old Main, the oldest building on campus. Following classes added their names {{for more than a decade}} and then the university took over responsibility for adding new classes, as well as adding the names of students who graduated prior to 1905. Through most of the 20th century, the names were impressed in wet cement using brass letters. As the campus grew, and the graduating classes got bigger, the operation became unduly time-consuming. In 1986, the university's physical plant developed a special machine called the [...] "Senior Sand Hog" [...] to engrave the thousands of names required each year. School superstition states that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> luck to step on the Class of 1900; additionally it is said that if one steps on the name of the first graduating class, you will never graduate from the University of Arkansas.|$|E
2500|$|Less flatteringly, an {{anonymous}} reviewer of Durand-Ruel’s Impressionist Exhibition in New York City {{wrote in the}} newspaper The Sun that, “The great master, from his own point of view, must surely be Seurat whose monstrous picture of The Bathers consumes so large {{a part of the}} GalleryD. This is a picture conceived in a coarse, vulgar, and commonplace mind, the work of a man seeking distinction by the vulgar qualification and expedient of size. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>bad</b> from every point of view, including his own.” This was {{by no means the only}} such uncomplimentary review in American and French newspapers. But with the passage of decades, the Bathers slowly emerged into critical respectability. The critic and friend of Seurat, FélixFénéon waited many years before commenting, ‘Though I did not commit myself in writing, I then [...] completely realised the importance of this painting.‘ For many years, Bathers at Asnières remained in the possession of Seurat’s family, and in 1900 the work was purchased by Felix Fénéon. In 1924 it was purchased for the British national collections and hung in the TateGallery. It was moved in 1961 to the National Gallery where it has remained since.|$|E
