50|$|With {{regard to}} the cause of the {{detachment}} of the <b>downstop</b> assembly, it is considered highly probable that during the maintenance works for preventing the nut from loosening, which the company carried out on the <b>downstop</b> assembly about one and a half months prior to the accident based on the service letter from the manufacturer of the aircraft, the washer on the nut side of the assembly was omitted, following which the <b>downstop</b> on the nut side of the assembly fell off and then the <b>downstop</b> assembly eventually fell off the track. It is considered highly probable that a factor contributing to the detachment of the <b>downstop</b> assembly was the design of the <b>downstop</b> assembly, which was unable to prevent the assembly from falling off if the washer is not installed.|$|E
50|$|With {{regard to}} the cause of the {{puncture}} in the track can, it is certain that the <b>downstop</b> assembly having detached from the aft end of the above-mentioned inboard main track fell off into the track can, and when the slat was retracted, the assembly was pressed by the track against the track can and punctured it.|$|E
50|$|Due to the accident, on August 25, the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered {{emergency}} {{inspections of}} wing leading-edge slat tracks on all Next Generation Boeing 737 aircraft. The Emergency Airworthiness Directive (EAD) from the FAA requires operators {{to inspect the}} slat track <b>downstop</b> to check for missing parts, ensure proper installation, and check {{the inside of the}} slat can for foreign object debris and damage. The directive requires operators to inspect within 24 days and every 3000 flight cycles thereafter. Following feedback from completed inspections revealing loose parts in several other aircraft and one with a damaged slat can, the FAA issued a new emergency airworthiness directive on August 28. Airlines were then required to perform the inspection on Next Generation Boeing 737 aircraft within 10 days instead of 24 days. In addition, the AD required a one-time torquing of the nut and bolt in the <b>downstop</b> assembly for the slat track within 24 days.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} the aeroelastic {{analysis of a}} tiltrotor configuration. The 1 / 5 scale wind tunnel semispan model of the V- 22 tiltrotor aircraft is considered. The analysis is performed {{by means of a}} multi-body code, based on an original formulation. The differential equilibrium problem is stated in terms of first order differential equations. The equilibrium equations of every rigid body are written, together with the definitions of the momenta. The bodies are connected by kinematic constraints, applied in form of Lagrangian multipliers. Deformable components are mainly modelled by means of beam elements, based on an original finite volume formulation. Multidisciplinar problems can be solved by adding user-defined differential equations. In the presented analysis the equations related to the control of the swash-plate of the model are considered. Advantages of a multi-body aeroelastic code over existing comprehensive rotorcraft codes include the exact modelling of the kinematics of the hub, the detailed modelling of the flexibility of critical hub components, and the possibility to simulate steady flight conditions as well as wind-up and maneuvers. The simulations described in the paper include: 1) the analysis of the aeroelastic stability, with particular regard to the proprotor/pylon instability that is peculiar to tiltrotors, 2) the determination of the dynamic behavior of the system and of the loads due to typical maneuvers, with particular regard to the conversion from helicopter to airplane mode, and 3) the stress evaluation in critical components, such as the pitch links and the conversion <b>downstop</b> spring...|$|E
