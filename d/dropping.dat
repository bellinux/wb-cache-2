40|$|Deformation and {{breakup of}} a {{three-dimensional}} viscous <b>drop</b> in isotropic turbulence has been mod-eled by direct numerical simulation. A pseudospec-tral {{representation of the}} turbulent outer flow field is rigorously connected to a detailed three-dimen-sional description of the <b>drop</b> microphysics using boundary integral calculations. The <b>drop</b> {{is assumed to be}} smaller than the Kolmogorov scale. <b>Drop</b> dynamics depend on the <b>drop</b> viscosity and a capil-lary number. In weaker flows, our simulations indi-cate that <b>drops</b> break at modest length into two large daughter <b>drops</b> with only a small volume of satellite <b>drops.</b> In stronger flows, <b>drops</b> become highly elongated before breaking and produce many smaller <b>drops.</b> <b>Drops</b> with higher viscosity are stabi-lized against breakup. Under the same conditions, our simulations show that on some trajectories <b>drops</b> may become highly elongated and recover to modest length without breaking while <b>drops</b> on other trajectories may break at only modest length. Our results indicate that simplified models are unre-liable predictors of <b>drop</b> breakup. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of mixing and satellite <b>drop</b> formation following the coalescence of initially stationary low-viscosity <b>drops</b> {{of the same}} liquid has been investigated using immiscible systems. The main parameters of interest are the <b>drop</b> sizes, the <b>drop</b> viscosity and the host viscosity. For <b>drops</b> of equal sizes there is no mixing following coalescence, {{which is consistent with}} that first demonstrated on the Skylab. However, for <b>drops</b> of unequal sizes there is considerable mixing with the smaller <b>drop</b> penetrating the larger <b>drop</b> as a vortex. In the extreme case of coalescence of a small <b>drop</b> with the bulk of the same liquid at a flat interface, the measured penetration depth is found to be proportional to the 5 / 4 th power of the <b>drop</b> diameter and inversely proportional to the square root of <b>drop</b> viscosity. When the <b>drop</b> and host viscosities are comparable, <b>drop</b> penetration is prematurely terminated by the formation of a satellite <b>drop.</b> However, when the <b>drop</b> diameter ratio (large to small) is below a critical number, satellite <b>drop</b> formation is inhibited and coalescence goes to completion. The influence of drop-host viscosity ratio on this critical diameter ratio has been examined...|$|R

50|$|Nozzle {{type and}} capacity: Full cone nozzles {{have the largest}} <b>drop</b> size, {{followed}} by flat spray nozzles. Hollow cone nozzles produce the smallest <b>drop</b> size. Spraying pressure: <b>Drop</b> size increases with lower spraying pressure and decreases with higher pressure. Flow rate: Flow rate has a direct effect on <b>drop</b> size. An increase in flow rate will increase the pressure <b>drop</b> and decrease the <b>drop</b> size, while a decrease in flow rate will decrease the pressure <b>drop</b> and increase the <b>drop</b> size.|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of an oil <b>drop</b> from a single capillary in a continuous phase flowing perpendicular to the capillary opening has been studied numerically. The shear stress at the interface of the forming <b>drop,</b> the angular velocity inside the <b>drop</b> and the pressure field around the <b>drop</b> have been determined in {{a cross section of}} the <b>drop</b> formation area. The results show a maximum pressure in the continuous phase near the stagnation point and a maximum shear stress in both phases nearer the top of the forming <b>drop.</b> The lowest pressures were found behind the top of the <b>drop,</b> where the surrounding flow starts to separate from the interface of the <b>drop.</b> The shear stress outside the <b>drop</b> causes a drag which, together with the drag originated from the pressure field around the <b>drop,</b> promotes <b>drop</b> detachment...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. Cooling tower {{rain zone}} {{performance}} {{characteristics such as}} the loss coefficient and the Merkel number are evaluated and simulated. To this end the influence of <b>drop</b> diameter and <b>drop</b> deformation on the velocity, path length and cooling of single water <b>drops</b> are investigated. Experimental <b>drop</b> size and pressure <b>drop</b> data over a counterflow rain zone are presented {{and the effect of}} <b>drop</b> deformation on the pressure <b>drop</b> is investigated using the experimental data and CFD. Using the experimental <b>drop</b> size data and CFD, the performance uncertainty produced by using the Rosin-Rammler <b>drop</b> distribution function as opposed to the discrete <b>drop</b> distribution data is investigated. CFD models are developed to investigate the feasibility of modelling rain zones by assuming a constant <b>drop</b> diameter and to establish which diameter definition is the most representative of a particular polydisperse <b>drop</b> distribution. These models were used to validate the correlations for the rain zone performance characteristics proposed in literature...|$|R
