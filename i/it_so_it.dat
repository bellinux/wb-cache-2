5|$|In 2012, Warner Bros. {{announced}} that negotiations {{had been made}} to produce another installment, with the intention of having Will Smith reprise his role. In April 2014, the studio attained a script entitled A Garden at the End of the World, described as a post-apocalyptic variation of The Searchers. Studio executives found so many similarities to I Am Legend in the screenplay, they had the writer Gary Graham rewrite <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> could serve as the next film. Serving as a reboot of the story, the studio hopes to create a franchise of films. Will Smith, who is known for his reluctance to appear in sequels, has not commented on whether he will appear or not.|$|E
5|$|Construction resumed in 1879 {{under the}} {{direction}} of Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Lincoln Casey of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Casey redesigned the foundation, strengthening <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> could support a structure that ultimately weighed more than 40,000 tons. The first stone atop the unfinished stump was laid August 7, 1880 in a small ceremony attended by President Rutherford B. Hayes, Casey and a few others. The president placed a small coin on which he had scratched his initials and the date in the bed of wet cement at the 150-foot level before the first stone was laid on top of it. Casey found 92 memorial stones (presented stones) already inlaid into the interior walls of the first phase of construction. Before construction continued he temporarily removed eight stones at the 150-foot level so that the walls at that level could be sloped outward, producing thinner second-phase walls. He inserted those stones and most of the remaining memorial stones stored in the lapidarium into the interior walls during 1885–89. The bottom third of the monument is a slightly lighter shade {{than the rest of the}} construction because the marble was obtained from different quarries.|$|E

25|$|By 1958, {{demand for}} land by ex-servicemen had declined, but the scheme had been so {{successful}} {{that the government was}} reluctant to end <b>it,</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> instead opened it up to all civilians.

25|$|In June 1944, Gustaf Mannerheim, {{to ensure}} German support while a major Soviet {{offensive}} was threatening Finland, thought {{it necessary to}} agree to the pact the German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop demanded. But even then Mannerheim managed to distance himself from the pact, and it fell to President Risto Ryti to sign <b>it,</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> {{came to be known as}} the Ryti-Ribbentrop Agreement. This allowed Mannerheim to revoke the agreement upon the resignation of President Ryti at the start of August 1944. Mannerheim succeeded Ryti as president.|$|E

25|$|Noël Corbu {{circulated}} {{the story}} from the mid-1950s {{when he opened his}} restaurant that Saunière discovered parchments in the hollow pillar of his Altar in 1891, and these related to the treasure of Blanche of Castile, and which 'according to the archives' consisted of 28,500,000 gold pieces. This was the treasure of the French crown assembled by Blanche of Castile to pay the ransom of Saint Louis, a prisoner of the infidels, the surplus of which she had hidden at Rennes-le-Château. Saunière had only found one part of <b>it,</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> was necessary to continue his investigations.|$|E

25|$|By the way, {{would you}} convey my {{compliments}} to the purist who reads your proofs {{and tell him}} or her that I write {{in a sort of}} broken-down patois which is something like the way a Swiss-waiter talks, and that when I split an infinitive, God damn it, I split <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> will remain split, and when I interrupt the velvety smoothness of my more or less literate syntax with a few sudden words of barroom vernacular, this is done with the eyes wide open and the mind relaxed and attentive.

But in summer the yang potency {{will be lost}} in approximately twenty days. The best material is that which had not been left too long, for when the yang potency is abundant it will give a 'take' with nine persons out of ten people—and finally it becomes completely inactive, and will not work at all.

25|$|This {{is often}} highly {{emphasized}} by spectators and novice vaulters, {{but it is}} arguably the easiest phase of the vault and {{is a result of}} proper execution of previous phases. This phase mainly consists of the vaulter pushing off the pole and releasing <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> falls away from the bar and mats. As the torso goes over and around the bar, the vaulter is facing the bar. Rotation of the body over the bar occurs naturally, and the vaulter's main concern is making sure that their arms, face and any other appendages do not knock the bar off as they go over. The vaulter should land near the middle of the foam landing mats, or pits, face up.|$|E

25|$|Lactase enzymes {{similar to}} those {{produced}} in the small intestines of humans are produced industrially by fungi of the genus Aspergillus. The enzyme, β-galactosidase, is available in tablet form {{in a variety of}} doses, in many countries without a prescription. It functions well only in high-acid environments, such as that found in the human gut due to the addition of gastric juices from the stomach. Unfortunately, too much acid can denature <b>it,</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> should not be taken on an empty stomach. Also, the enzyme is ineffective if it does not reach the small intestine by the time the problematic food does. Lactose-sensitive individuals can experiment with both timing and dosage to fit their particular needs.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to previously mentioned churches poor state, {{there is no}} other information about <b>it</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> can be assumed that it wasn't used for holding Holy Mass but {{was in the process of}} deterioration over the years. Church was restored in 1914 thanks to the Austrian conservator Anton Gnirs from Pula. However, immediately after World War II it was again damaged. Namely, in the immediate vicinity of the church was an inn of Maračić family where Yugoslav Partisans stored their weapons and ammunition during the war. On 3 October 1945 the explosion that badly damaged church, namely its dome, occurred. The explosion was so strong that it was heard all over the island. 15 islanders who have sought refuge in the surrounding fields and along the coast were killed while the area of the inn turned into a crater. Three years later, the church was restored to its present-day appearance. The renovation was led by the architect Aleksandar Freudenreich. At the site of the former inn was built anotherone while a small harbor was built nearby.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the surface}} water of deep {{tropical}} lakes never reaches {{the temperature of}} maximum density, there is no process that makes the water mix. The deeper layer becomes oxygen starved and can become saturated with carbon dioxide, or other gases such as sulfur dioxide if {{there is even a}} trace of volcanic activity. Exceptional events, such as earthquakes or landslides, can cause mixing which rapidly brings the deep layers up to the surface and release a vast cloud of gas which lay trapped in solution in the colder water {{at the bottom of the}} lake. This is called a limnic eruption. An example is the disaster at Lake Nyos in Cameroon. The amount of gas that can be dissolved in water is directly related to pressure. As deep water surfaces, the pressure drops and a vast amount of gas comes out of solution. Under these circumstances carbon dioxide is hazardous because it is heavier than air and displaces <b>it,</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> may flow down a river valley to human settlements and cause mass asphyxiation.|$|E

25|$|In certain circumstances, {{a target}} process will filter any byte from the {{injected}} shellcode {{that is not}} a printable or alphanumeric character. Under such circumstances, the range of instructions {{that can be used to}} write a shellcode becomes very limited. A solution to this problem was published by Rix in Phrack 57 in which he showed it was possible to turn any code into alphanumeric code. A technique often used is to create self-modifying code, because this allows the code to modify its own bytes to include bytes outside of the normally allowed range, thereby expanding the range of instructions it can use. Using this trick, a self-modifying decoder can be created that initially uses only bytes in the allowed range. The main code of the shellcode is encoded, also only using bytes in the allowed range. When the output shellcode is run, the decoder can modify its own code to be able to use any instruction it requires to function properly and then continues to decode the original shellcode. After decoding the shellcode the decoder transfers control to <b>it,</b> <b>so</b> <b>it</b> can be executed as normal. It has been shown that it is possible to create arbitrarily complex shellcode that looks like normal text in English.|$|E
