40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{influence}} of spatial heterogeneity on the choice of entry modes by multinational enterprises (MNEs). We claim that {{the location of the}} target firm influences the choice of partial ownership, i. e., an MNE?s choice to maintain a local partner. MNEs normally execute partial acquisitions to reduce their liability of foreignness and to preserve their target?s inherent competencies, particularly in highly <b>innovative</b> <b>and</b> internationally <b>competitive</b> <b>sectors.</b> However, this phenomenon occurs less frequently if target firms are located in areas that are characterized by relevant externalities, such as core cities and industrial districts. In particular, core cities allow foreign MNEs to access not only a variety of information and knowledge, but also other externalities that are associated with international interconnectedness; industrial districts provide MNEs with easier access to industry-specific agglomeration economies (a local pool of skilled labor, local input-output linkages, and local knowledge spillovers). Thus, both types of locations reduce an MNE?s need to maintain a local partner, although these locations provide substitutes for different aspects of the target firm?s competences. Empirical evidence from foreign acquisitions of local manufacturing firms that occurred in Italy during the 2001 - 2010 period confirms these expectations...|$|R

In order to analyze the economic activities in the territory three important dimensions are pointed out: <b>innovative</b> <b>and</b> <b>competitive</b> dynamics; the economic relations within sectors and enterprises in the local economy; and the rural-urban relationships. About 80 interviews to local actors were made, and other available data and surveys were processed. The results show that the rural-urban relationships are the key to understand the economy in this region. Nevertheless, the local economy presents a fragmented development: a majority of low competitiveness sectors with scarce aptitude to generate economic local interrelationships, <b>and</b> some <b>competitive</b> <b>sectors</b> but that work disconnected {{of the rest of the}} local economy. Finally, the way for a possible transformation is discussed for this region, as well as some conditions that must accompany this process. territorial economic development, North-East of Uruguay, productive organization, innovation, rural-urban relationships. ...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{examines}} whether {{differences in}} wage rigidity across sectors {{can be explained}} by differences in workforce composition, wage-bargaining institutions, technology and competition. We rely on a large administrative matched employer-employee dataset for Belgium over the period 1990 – 2002. Our results indicate that downward real wage rigidity is significantly higher for white-collar workers, lower for older workers and decreases with the level of earnings and bonuses. Beyond labour force composition effects, we find that wages are more rigid in sectors with predominant centralised wage-setting at the sector level as opposed to firm-level agreements. Also, more labour-intensive <b>sectors</b> <b>and</b> <b>competitive</b> <b>sectors</b> have more rigid wages.|$|R
