40|$|To {{reach the}} brain from {{peripheral}} sites, prions must colonize various cell types within the lymphoreticular compartment. However, no prion entry receptors are yet known. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are pattern-recognition receptors that bind {{a multitude of}} pathogens and are therefore candidates as effectors of prion entry. Moreover, injection of unmethylated CpG oligodinucleotides, which stimulate TLR 9, {{has been reported to}} delay peripherally initiated scrapie. We therefore studied prion infection in MyD 88 (-/-) mice, which are defective in TLR signalling. Despite subtle defects in splenic microarchitecture, MyD 88 (-/-) mice challenged intraperitoneally or intracerebrally were fully susceptible to disease and died of scrapie after similar incubation times to those of wild-type mice.

40|$|The {{specific}} packaging of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome is hypothesised to {{be driven}} by Core- RNA interactions. To identify the regions of the viral genome involved in this process, we used SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) to identify RNA aptamers which bind specifically to Core in vitro. Comparison of these aptamers to multiple HCV genomes revealed the presence of a conserved terminal loop motif within short RNA stem-loop structures. We postulated that interactions of these motifs, as well as sub-motifs which were present in HCV genomes at statistically significant levels, with the Core protein may drive virion assembly. We mutated 8 of these predicted motifs within the HCV infectious molecular clone JFH- 1, thereby producing a range of mutant viruses predicted to possess altered RNA secondary structures. RNA replication and viral titre were unaltered in viruses possessing only one mutated structure. However, <b>infectivity</b> <b>titres</b> were decreased in viruses possessing a higher number of mutated regions. This work thus identified multiple novel RNA motifs which appear to contribute to genome packaging.

40|$|Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies are {{characterized}} by the accumulation of PrPSc, a protease-resistant form of a host-derived protein termed PrPC. Substantial evidence indicates that PrPSc represents {{an essential component of}} the infectious agent, which is termed prion. The accumulation of PrPSc within the central nervous system of prion-infected organisms is a dynamic process that is regulated both by production and by clearance of PrPSc. Although several proteases have been implicated in proteolysis of PrPC, the mechanisms underlying proteolysis of PrPSc remain unclear. Here, it was investigated whether neprilysin, a metalloprotease known to degrade extracellular amyloidogenic proteins such as amyloid-b, plays a role in prion pathogenesis in vivo. As neprilysin has a broad substrate specificity and is localized subcellularly in the vicinity of PrP, it represents a plausible candidate for prion degradation. Prions were therefore administered to mice lacking or overexpressing neprilysin in brain. However, the gene dosage of neprilysin did not modulate accumulation of PrPSc in brain. Also, incubation times and clinical course of prion disease, as well as brain <b>infectivity</b> <b>titres</b> at terminal stage, were unaffected.

40|$|SUMMARY: Experiments {{were made}} to {{determine}} whether the infectivity of virus suspensions was influenced by exposure to daylight of normal laboratory intensity or by exposure to artificial light. The infectivity of dilutions of virus suspensions held in bottles or cells was determined after exposure to light under a variety of conditions; the influence of exposure was indicated by comparison with the infec-tivity of control suspensions kept in darkness. The <b>infectivity</b> <b>titres</b> indicated by serial dilutions, in phosphate saline, of unfiltered fresh suspensions of egg strains of the viruses of vesicular stomatitis, influenza, Newcastle disease and fowl-plague following exposure to daylight for 4 hr. were 3 - 5 logarithmic units lower than those indicated by the dark controls. Changes of this magnitude suggest that with these virus strains significant errors might arise in infectivity titrations if suspensions were exposed to light for much shorter periods.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Prion disease {{transmission}} and pathogenesis {{are linked to}} misfolded, typically protease resistant (PrPres) conformers of the normal cellular prion protein (PrPC), with the former posited to be the principal constituent of the infectious 'prion'. Unexplained discrepancies observed between detectable PrPres and infectivity levels exemplify the complexity in deciphering the exact biophysical nature of prions and those host cell factors, if any, which contribute to transmission efficiency. In order to improve our understanding of these important issues, this study utilized a bioassay validated cell culture model of prion infection to investigate discordance between PrPres levels and <b>infectivity</b> <b>titres</b> at a subcellular resolution. FINDINGS: Subcellular fractions enriched in lipid rafts or endoplasmic reticulum/mitochondrial marker proteins were equally highly efficient at prion transmission, despite lipid raft fractions containing up to eight times the levels of detectable PrPres. Brain homogenate infectivity was not differentially enhanced by subcellular fraction-specific co-factors, and proteinase K pre-treatment of selected fractions modestly, but equally reduced infectivity. Only lipid raft associated infectivity was enhanced by sonication. CONCLUSIONS: This study authenticates a subcellular disparity in PrPres and infectivity levels, and eliminates simultaneous divergence of prion strains as the explanation for this phenomenon. On balance, the results align best with the concept that transmission efficiency is influenced more by intrinsic characteristics of the infectious prion, rather than cellular microenvironment conditions or absolute PrPres levels.

40|$|Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies {{are often}} {{propagated}} by extracerebral inoculation. The mechanism of spread from peripheral portals of {{entry to the}} central nervous system (neuroinvasion) is complex: while lymphatic organs typically show early accumulation of prions, and B-cells and follicular dendritic cells are required for efficient neuroinvasion, actual entry into {{the central nervous system}} occurs probably via peripheral nerves and may utilize a PrP(C) -dependent mechanism. This study shows that transgenic mice overexpressing PrP(C) undergo rapid and efficient neuroinvasion upon intranerval and footpad inoculation of prions. These mice exhibited deposition of the pathological isoform of the prion protein (PrP(Sc)) and infectivity in specific portions of the central and peripheral sensory pathways, but almost no splenic PrP(Sc) accumulation. In contrast, wild-type mice always accumulated splenic PrP(Sc), and had widespread deposition of PrP(Sc) throughout the central nervous system even when prions were injected directly into the sciatic nerve. These results indicate that a lympho-neural sequence of spread occurs in wild-type mice even upon intranerval inoculation, while overexpression of PrP(C) leads to substantial predilection of intranerval over lymphoreticular spread. The rate of transport of infectivity in peripheral nerves was ca. 0. 7 mm per day, and prion <b>infectivity</b> <b>titres</b> of sciatic nerves were much higher in tga 20 than in wild-type mice, suggesting that overexpression of PrP(C) modulates the capacity for intranerval transport...|$|R
