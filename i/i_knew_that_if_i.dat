25|$|I {{was saved}} {{from the gas}} chambers, saved from Hitler. I spent several years in Nazi death camps. Besides {{the fact that they}} murdered my wife and 11 children, my mother, my sisters and my brother – of my whole family, some 150 people, I {{was the only one who}} survived – I {{witnessed}} their cruelty. I remember as if it were today how they shot me in the arm. I was afraid to go to the Nazi infirmary, though there were doctors there. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> went in, I'd never come out alive. … Despite my fear of the Nazis, I plucked a leaf from a tree and stuck it to my wound to stanch the bleeding. Then I cut a branch and tied it around the wound to hold it in place. With God's help, it healed in three days. Then I promised myself that if, with God's help, I got well and got out of there, away from those resha'im (wicked people), I would build a hospital in Eretz Yisrael where every human being would be cared for with dignity. And the basis of that hospital would be that the doctors and nurses would believe that there is a God in this world and that when they treat a patient, they are fulfilling the greatest mitzvah in the Torah.|$|E

[...] "I {{had been in}} arid {{out of the side}} {{for a couple of years}} and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> signed for World Series Cricket I was going to get some {{monetary}} reward for all the hours I'd spent in the past six or seven years. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> kept playing for the board I wasn't guaranteed any financial reward at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hitchcock {{returned}} to the UK for an extended visit in late 1943 and early 1944. While there he made two short films in French for the British Ministry of Information: Bon Voyage and Aventure Malgache. The two British propaganda films made for the Free French were the only films that Hitchcock made in the French language, and they [...] "feature typical Hitchcockian touches". On his motivation for making the films, Hitchcock stated: [...] "I {{felt the need to}} make a little contribution to the war effort, and I was both overweight and over-age for military service. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> did nothing, I'd regret {{it for the rest of}} my life." [...] From late June to late July 1945, Hitchcock served as [...] "treatment advisor" [...] on a Holocaust documentary which used footage provided by the Allied Forces. It was produced by Sidney Bernstein of the British Ministry of Information, and was assembled in London. Bernstein brought his future 1948–49 production partner Hitchcock on board as a consultant for the film editing process for the British Ministry of Information and the American Office of War Information.|$|E

2500|$|Abe {{was arrested}} and interrogated over eight sessions. When asked why she had severed Ishida's genitalia, Abe replied, [...] "Because I couldn't take his head or body with me. I {{wanted to take the}} part of him that brought back to me the most vivid memories." [...] The {{interrogating}} officer was struck by Abe's demeanor when asked why she had killed Ishida. [...] "Immediately she became excited and her eyes sparkled in a strange way." [...] Her answer was: [...] "I loved him so much, I wanted him all to myself. But since we were not husband and wife, as long as he lived he could be embraced by other women. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> killed him no other woman could ever touch him again, so I killed him....." [...] In attempting to explain what distinguished Abe's case from over a dozen other similar cases in Japan, William Johnston suggests that it is this answer which captured the imagination of the nation. [...] "She had killed not out of jealousy but out of love." [...] Mark Schreiber notes that the Sada Abe incident occurred {{at a time when the}} Japanese media were preoccupied with extreme political and military troubles, including the Ni Ni Roku incident and a looming full-scale war in China. He suggests that a sensationalistic sex scandal such as this served as a welcome national release from the disturbing events of the time. The incident also struck a chord with the ero-guro-nansensu ("erotic-grotesque-nonsense") style popular at the time, and the Sada Abe Incident came to represent that genre for years to come.|$|E

60|$|But I insisted {{we should}} be parted, and parted in the end for ever, and there I was the wiser of the two.

6000|$|There a light shone {{out across}} the snow from a window, and I am {{perfectly}} willing to admit that I crawled toward it on hands and knees, for angry voices now reached me, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> raised myself and the watcher had changed his position he could see me.
