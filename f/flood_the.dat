5|$|English forces laid siege to Loch Leven in 1301, but the {{garrison}} was relieved {{in the same}} year when the siege was broken by Sir John Comyn. King Robert the Bruce (reigned 1306–1329) is known to have visited the castle in 1313 and again in 1323. Following Bruce's death, the English invaded again, and laid siege to Loch Leven Castle in 1335 in support of the pretender Edward Balliol (d. 1364). According to the 14th-century chronicle of John of Fordun, the English attempted to <b>flood</b> <b>the</b> castle by building a dam across the outflow of the loch. The water level rose for a month, until the captain of the English force, Sir John de Stirling, left to attend the festival of Saint Margaret of Scotland. The defenders, under Alan de Vipont, took the opportunity {{to come out of the}} castle at night, and damaged the dam, causing it to collapse and <b>flood</b> <b>the</b> English camp. The story has, however, been doubted by later historians.|$|E
5|$|The Flood {{have been}} {{featured}} in four series of Halo action figures, produced by Joyride Studios. For Halo: Combat Evolved, Joyride produced a Carrier Form and Infection form bundle. Halo2s series contains both a human Combat Form and Infection form (bundled with the Master Chief), which were released after the video game. Reviewer Aaron Simmer of Armchair Empire.com expressed the sentiment that Joyride's models could not totally capture the ghoulishness texture and detail of the <b>Flood.</b> <b>The</b> action figures for Halo 3 were produced by McFarlane Toys and although the first series did not feature the <b>Flood,</b> <b>the</b> third series featured a human Combat Form.|$|E

This picture, which has a large number of figures, conforms the most closely to the format of the paintings that had been done around the walls.|$|E

5|$|There {{was some}} sense of {{imminent}} threat in Grand Forks, but the cities could not prepare for such an enormous <b>flood.</b> <b>The</b> National Weather Service (NWS) had a long-standing forecast for the river to crest at 49feet (14.9m), which was the river's highest level during the 1979 <b>flood.</b> <b>The</b> cities {{had been able to}} get their dikes to this level, but the river continued to rise past it, to the astonishment of the NWS (which did not upgrade its forecast until April 16, the day the river actually reached 49feet). The dikes in the low-lying Lincoln Drive neighborhood of Grand Forks were the first to break, doing so early on April 18. Other dikes over the Grand Forks and East Grand Forks area would fail that day and the next, flooding thousands of homes.|$|E
5|$|A leat {{from this}} stretch was created at {{around the time}} of the {{construction}} of the canal to provide water for the Twyford Mead water meadows. Farming of the water meadows continued until around 1930, after the closure of the navigation itself. It was a labour-intensive method of land management, but the controlled flooding of the meadows, with the deposition of silt from the water, enabled the land to produce two crops of hay per year, as well as grazing for sheep and cattle. Demonstrations of the techniques used to <b>flood</b> <b>the</b> meadows are still carried out occasionally.|$|E
5|$|According {{to another}} legend, {{there was once}} a sea where the Dnieper River now flows. When Saint Andrew came to Kiev and erected a cross on the place where the Saint Andrew's Church now stands, the sea went away. The only part that {{remained}} of the sea is under the mountain on which Kiev sits today. When the church was built there in the 18th century, a spring opened under the altar. The church has no bells, because, according to the legend, when the first bell strikes, the water can revive again and <b>flood</b> <b>the</b> left bank of Kiev.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{creation}} of Chew Valley Lake and river level controls at Keynsham Lock and weir, Keynsham was prone to flooding. The Great Flood of 1968 inundated {{large parts of the}} town, destroying the town's bridges including the county bridge over the Avon which had stood since medieval times, and private premises on Dapps Hill; the devastation was viewed by the Duke of Edinburgh. After the <b>flood</b> <b>the</b> Memorial Park, which had been laid out after World War II was extended.|$|E
5|$|By August 16, 2011, {{the plant}} had {{generated}} 500TWh of electricity. In July 2008 it generated 10.3TWh of electricity, its first month over 10TWh. On June 30, 2009, after the river flow rate increased to over 24,000m3, all 28 generators were switched on, producing only 16,100MW because the head available during flood season is insufficient. During an August 2009 <b>flood,</b> <b>the</b> plant first reached its maximum output {{for a short}} period.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{immediately}} after God of War II, Kratos, Gaia, {{and the other}} Titans ascend Mount Olympus to destroy the Olympian Gods. Poseidon launches a counter-assault against the Titans but is killed by Kratos and Gaia; his death causes the oceans to <b>flood</b> <b>the</b> world. Reaching the peak of Olympus, they try to attack Zeus, but he drives them back and knocks them off the mountain. Gaia clings to the mountainside and refuses to save Kratos, calling him {{nothing more than a}} pawn for the Titans' revenge.|$|E

5|$|Latest {{research}} has also shown that Murray cod in fact live their entire lifecycle within the main channel of the stream. Earlier ideas that Murray cod spawn on floodplains, or the larvae feed on floodplains, are incorrect. Murray cod breed in the main river channel or, in times of spring <b>flood,</b> <b>the</b> inundated upper portion of the main channel and tributary channels, but not on floodplains. Murray cod larvae feed within the main river channel or, in times of spring flood, on the inundated upper portion of the main channel and the channel/floodplain boundary, {{but not on the}} floodplain.|$|E
30|$|The NMR {{experiments}} were conducted at three stages: after saturating the sample with KCl solution; after <b>flooding</b> <b>the</b> sample with damaging fluid (fresh water or HCl); and after <b>flooding</b> <b>the</b> sample with KCl solution {{at the final}} stage. NMR results show the pore distribution of different core samples before and after flooding with damaging fluids. T 2 signal distribution response showed that for all cores, the macropores represent the major contribution to the total porosity before <b>flooding</b> <b>the</b> damaging fluid. However, after <b>flooding</b> <b>the</b> damaging fluid, T 2 signal distribution response was different for different cores and for different damaging fluid.|$|R

5|$|Previous {{practices}} had required {{ships to}} withstand the flooding of a single forward hold, but did not guard against situations where two holds would <b>flood.</b> <b>The</b> case where two after (rear) holds are flooded is no better, because the engine room is quickly flooded, leaving the ship without propulsion. If two holds {{in the middle of}} the ship are flooded, the stress on the hull can become so great that the ship snaps in two.|$|E
5|$|Somewhere between 100 and 200 {{million years}} after the Serenitatis basin and Taurus–Littrow formed, the lavas that began to seep through the lunar crust began to <b>flood</b> <b>the</b> low-lying areas. These lava flows were often {{accompanied}} by fire fountains that blanketed the surrounding area with tiny glass beads. These beads were sometimes colored orange, explaining the orange soil discovered by the Apollo 17 astronauts at Shorty crater. Most of these beads, however, were darkly colored, resulting in the dark appearance of the Serenitatis basin from Earth.|$|E
5|$|The Germans, too, had {{suffered}} heavy casualties; the 116th Panzer Division, for example, {{had lost its}} offensive capabilities after countless attempts to break the U.S. First Army's encirclement of Aachen. This gave American and British commanders {{a false sense of}} security, believing that the Wehrmacht did not have the strength to launch a counteroffensive. Given their view {{on the state of the}} German armed forces and their need to push to the Rur, the First Army decided to drive German forces out of the Hürtgen Forest—located on the Belgian–German border—in an attempt to take a series of dams which could be used by the Germans to <b>flood</b> <b>the</b> valley below.|$|E

5|$|The Mint {{arranged}} to outsource {{part of the}} coin-making process, and pledged to <b>flood</b> <b>the</b> nation with coins by 1965. Despite an increased need for coins in an improving economy, merchants made it past the 1964 holiday season without severe shortages, though the half dollar had stopped circulating. Most Fed facilities reported sufficient supplies of cents and nickels, with some still short on dimes and quarters, and shortages of half dollars everywhere—one Fed official wrote that his branch had not seen a half dollar deposited by a bank in eight months.|$|E
