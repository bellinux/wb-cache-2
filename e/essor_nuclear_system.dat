40|$|Thermal-hydraulics is {{recognized}} as a key scientific subject {{in the development of}} different innovative <b>nuclear</b> reactor <b>systems.</b> From the thermal-hydraulic point of view, different innovative reactors are mainly characterized by their coolants (gas, water, liquid metals and molten salt). They result in different micro- and macroscopic behavior of flow and heat transfer and require specific models and advanced analysis tools. However, many common thermal-hydraulic issues are identified among various innovative <b>nuclear</b> <b>systems.</b> InEurope, such cross-cutting thermal-hydraulics issues are the subject of the 7 th framework programme THINS (Thermal-Hydraulics of Innovative <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Systems)</b> project which runs from 2010 untill 2014.

40|$|A novel prompt {{decay mode}} of highly excited <b>nuclear</b> <b>systems</b> {{is shown to}} set in with {{necessity}} as a certain critical excitation energy per nucleon is reached. It is driven by a peculiar, open-ended type of spinodal instability, unique to self-bound open systems, and consists {{in parts of the}} system undergoing spontaneous indefinite thermal expansion ending in vaporization into the surrounding open space. The mode, named here spinodal vaporization, is distinctly different from all known decay modes of excited nuclei and faces no competition from the latter. It sets a natural upper limit for the excitation energy that can be thermalized by compound <b>nuclear</b> <b>systems,</b> while setting also a limit to the applicability of thermodynamics to the description of highly excited <b>nuclear</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

At relativistic bombarding energies, multifragmentation may be observed in peripheral collisions of heavy symmetric systems or more central collisions of mass asymmetric systems. The decay properties indicate a high degree of equilibration and are well described by statistical multifragmentation models.
