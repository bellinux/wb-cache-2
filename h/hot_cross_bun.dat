5000|$|In {{the time}} of Elizabeth I of England (1592), the London Clerk of Markets issued a decree forbidding the sale of <b>hot</b> <b>cross</b> <b>buns</b> and other spiced breads, except at burials, on Good Friday, or at Christmas.

As {{a result of this}} decree, <b>hot</b> <b>cross</b> <b>buns</b> at the time were primarily made in home kitchens. Further attempts to suppress the sale of these items took place during the reign of James I of England/James VI of Scotland (1603-1625).
