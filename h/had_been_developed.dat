5|$|Flux-cored, {{self-shielding}} or gasless wire-fed welding <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>developed</b> for {{simplicity and}} portability. This avoids the gas system of conventional GMAW {{and uses a}} cored wire containing a solid flux. This flux vaporises during welding and produces a plume of shielding gas. Although described as a 'flux', this compound has little activity and acts mostly as an inert shield. The wire is of slightly larger diameter than for a comparable gas-shielded weld, to allow room for the flux. The smallest available is 0.8mm diameter, compared to 0.6mm for solid wire. The shield vapor is slightly active, rather than inert, so the process is always MAGS but not MIG (inert gas shield). This limits the process to steel and not aluminium.|$|E
