500|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{debate over the}} years as to the depth of the Yogo dike and how many ounces of rough sapphires per ton it contains. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Delmer L. Brown, a geological engineer and gemologist, conducted the most thorough scientific exploration up to that time, concluding that the dike was at least [...] deep and that the concentration of rough sapphires was not constant throughout the deposit. Brown found that the dike had intruded into a pre-existing fault that had been a conduit for groundwater circulation. The overlying shale, the Kibbey Formation, was deposited on an unconformity, an ancient Mississippian-age karst erosion surface, and was not intruded by the dike. This groundwater action produced collapsed zones which were intruded by the dike to form breccia zones. Recent erosion in the area removed the overlying shales and again exposed the limestone to groundwater action which produced collapse breccias which include fragments of the <b>dike</b> <b>rock.</b> He determined that the erosion of the dike in the current erosion cycle was minimal.|$|E
40|$|Determining the {{ecological}} impacts of long-term change versus those caused by shorter-term variation {{is important for}} making predictions and managing ecosystems. Historical surveys offer potentially valuables baseline data {{for the evaluation of}} long-term change. This study is based on two historical ecological surveys at two rocky intertidal sites (<b>Dike</b> <b>Rock</b> and Ocean Beach) in San Diego, California. The historical surveys are notable in that they overlap with or predate a major oceanographic climate shift in Southern California in the late 1970 s. Although the 2012 surveys showed that the invertebrate communities at both sites had changed since the historical surveys, the changes were dissimilar. While both sites lost and gained a few invertebrate species, notably losing the predatory whelk Nucella emarginata and gaining another in Mexacanthina lugubris, species abundances at <b>Dike</b> <b>Rock</b> increased while those at Ocean Beach decreased. This {{may be due to the}} different substrates at the sites: the sandstone of Ocean Beach may have been more impacted by a changing wave climate than the basalt of <b>Dike</b> <b>Rock.</b> Data on the percent cover of macroalgae at Ocean Beach demonstrated changes in seven out of ten morphological groups.

40|$|An unexploited {{population}} of the sheep crab Loxorhynchus grandis (Majidae, Brachyura) was studied for {{three years in the}} nearshore region adjacent to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Over 1000 crabs were collected in monthly surveys at three sites in water of between 10 and 20 meters depth. Size, sex, reproductive condition, carapace condition, and leg damage were recorded before crabs were individually tagged and released. Four crab aggregations were observed at one of the sites (Sand Plain). The function of these aggregations seems to be for reproduction, as a lower percentage of brooding females, and a higher percentage of males was observed than when crabs were not aggregated. A total of 564 crabs was tagged at the Pier site and the overall recapture rate was 39 %. At the Pier adult females were more abundant than males, were recaptured more often (46 % vs. 20 %), and were also more sedentary than males. The Jolly-Seber mark-recapture technique was used to estimate the regional L. grandis population size, which ranged between zero and 300 crabs. Juvenile crabs were only found at the <b>Dike</b> <b>Rock</b> site and exhibited a peak in abundance between January and May. Adults were found occasionally at <b>Dike</b> <b>Rock,</b> but were most abundant at the Pier. Peak crab abundance at the Pier was in July for two years, and in January for one year. Adult males had significantly more damage to the claws and first pair of walking legs, and likely lose them in aggressive interactions. Females had a high frequency of damage to the first pair, perhaps sustained in mating behavior, while juveniles had radially symmetric patterns of leg damage, suggesting they were more passive and did not react to threats of leg damage. The speed that these crabs can move (0. 40 km hr- 1) was estimated by following tagged crabs for short periods of time. The results of this study also suggest that L. grandis has both alongshore and offshore separation of ontogenetic stages...|$|E
40|$|Primitive {{rocks that}} are related to {{continental}} flood basalts are rare, but often reveal crucial information on the ultimate sources of these huge outpourings of mantle-derived magma. Here we present mineral chemical data for mafic and ultramafic dikes from the Antarctic extension of the Jurassic (~ 180 Ma) Karoo continental flood basalt province that was emplaced during the initial stages of the breakup of the Gondwana supercontinent. We concentrate on two previously recognized high-Ti <b>dike</b> <b>rock</b> suites (Group 3 and Group 4) that exhibit high MgO contents (up to 22 wt. %). Both groups are characterized by Mg-rich olivine phenocrysts (up to Fo 90) that are not mantle xenocrysts and indicate derivation from relatively Mg-rich parental magmas. Orthopyroxene is a common phenocryst and groundmass phase indicating emplacement at mid-crustal pressures (2 – 5 kbar; depth of ~ 10 – 20 km). The parental magmas of Group 3 and Group 4 dikes can be associated with pyroxenite sources on the basis of high olivine NiO, high whole-rock Zn/Fe, and low whole-rock CaO. In the case of Group 3 dikes, however, the samples that contain the most Mg-rich olivine also exhibit the mildest pyroxenite fingerprint and indications of an additional olivine-bearing (peridotitic) source component. We propose that the pyroxenite fingerprint of Group 3 and Group 4 dikes reflects relatively low-degree melting of fertile mantle at high pressures beneath the thick and cold Gondwanan lithosphere. Such conditions limited high-degree melting of peridotite sources which may have been predominant in the generation of the Karoo low-Ti basalts within lithospheric thinning zones...|$|E
40|$|The area, {{covered by}} this report, {{includes}} about 108 square {{miles in the}} northeastern part of the Wasatch Plateau in central Utah. Clear Creek, Utah, is {{near the center of}} the area. Stratigraphy of the area is characterized by 18, 000 to 20, 000 feet of sedimentary rocks above the Precambrian basement. The oldest exposed stratigraphic unit is the 11 ancos Formation of late Cretaceous age; the youngest exposed stratigraphic unit is the North Horn Formation of Cretaceous-Tertiary age. The sedimentary rocks are mainly sandstone, shale, and coal. Sandstone and shale are the most abundant. Structure of the area is characterized by folds and normal faults. Folding began in mid-Cretaceous time. A later impulse occurred in late Cretaceous to early Tertiary. Folding was again rejuvenated in Eocene. The normal faults mostly trend north-south and east-west. The faults that trend north-south have more displacement and greater extent than those that trend east-west. North-south-trending faults have up to 2, 500 feet of displacement. Maximum displacement, on the east-west-trending faults, is 90 feet. The north-south-trending faults are the main structural control of the topography. In many cases, they outline uplifts separated by graben. Faults that trend north-south and east-west are considered to have formed at the same time. The age of the faults is considered to be late Oligocene to Miocene. The dikes are biotite orthoclase pyroxene lamprophyre. The igneous rock of the dikes resembles the lamprophyre type called minette. The presence of olivine and more augite than diopside probably places the rock between minette and kersantite. All dikes in the area are of the same mineral composition. Typical mineral composition of fresh <b>dike</b> <b>rock</b> is 33 percent biotite, 11 percent augite, 8 percent olivine, 4 percent magnetite, 38 percent groundmass, traces of apatite, and up to 5 percent secondary materials. The most common secondary materials are chlorite, calcite, quartz, and iron oxides. The groundmass is 85 to 90 percent orthoclase. The remainder of the material in the groundmass is plagioclase, probably albite, and mafic minerals including biotite and augite. A fe 1 dsparstaining technique was used to determine the composition of the dominant feldspar. The dikes are localized along faults and joints parallel to the faults. All but two of the 28 mapped dikes in the area are localized in east-west-trending fractures. Effects of the dikes on adjoining rocks are minimal. Dike temperature was not sufficiently high to melt the adjoining rocks. Effects on the coal are also minimal. Coke has been reported in the old underground mines of the area but was not recognized on the surface. Anthracite has formed locally near some dikes. The lamprophyric magma is considered to have originated by the melting of hydrous peridotite in the upper mantle. Melting of the hydrous peridotite produced appreciable amounts of water t CO 2, S 022 ̆ 7 and Cl. The volatile pressure increased as melting continued. At some point, the volatile pressure was sufficient to cause a rise of gaseous magma into pre-existing normal faults and joints. Mafic phenocrysts were carried in the melt until the volatile pressure was sufficiently reduced and the magma rapidly solidified to produce the extremely fine-grained groundmass. Emplacement of dikes by volatile pressure relates them to a nonexplosive diatremic type of intrusion. Emplacement of the magma occurred at a temperature between 600 o and 1, 000 o C. The dikes of the Wasatch Plateau are middle to late Tertiary in age. Most evidence indicates them to be late Oligocene to Miocene...|$|E

To help better define the spatial scale of resource procurement by the canyon's prehistoric population elemental analysis of samples collected from the dikes and selected stone tools was done by ICPMS (Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry). ICPMS was used because it can provide elemental â€œfingerprintsâ€� that can be used to distinguish source materials and correlate specific stone tools with individual source material sites. Relative abundances of minor elements, including transition metals and rare earth elements, can differ sufficiently between source rocks that elemental ratios can be used to link a stone tool with its source material in many cases.

Migmatization is indicated by gradations in structure and composition from the quartz diorite to the granite porphyroblastic development in the intermediate rock, and replacement textures in the granite and intermediate rock. Two parallel high-angle normal faults with displacements of 200 to 400 feet cross the area in a northeast southwest direction. Associated with the major faults are innumerable minor faults and fractures with displacements from a fraction of an inch to a foot or more in magnitude. The formation of Pine Flat Basin, the broad valley containing Crystal Lake, has been ascribed to glaciation, but the author believes that structural movements and stream erosion with accompanying landslides were the responsible factors.

The welded tuff was extruded next and was followed by the extrusion of the rhyolite after which caldera subsidence, was initiated and the remaining acidic magma was injected into the fractures to form a complex of short ring dikes of perlite. After the formation of the perlite dikes and perhaps concurrently with continued caldera subsidence, a magma of andesitic composition was extruded along caldera faults and possibly Basin and Range faults. Following extrusion of the magmas, the erosive processes began lowering the Wildcat Hills. More recently, Pleistocene Lake Bonneville was the principal agent of erosion and deposition, forming prominent terraces along the hills...|$|R

The blue flax, native to the countryside, is {{attributed}} many qualities both as clothing linen and for its medicinal properties. The eastern bluebird frequents the local orchards, farms, hedgerows and <b>rock</b> <b>dikes</b> {{in the area and}} is renowned for its songbird qualities.|$|R

Large scaled cross-cutting relationships between <b>rocks,</b> <b>dikes</b> and plutons easily provide certain but relatively broad time constrain on deformation. In contrast, monazite can itself be participated in deformation fabric, reaction and fracture, thus studying microfabrics and microtextures of monazite offers a more straightforward method of dating a deformation event.|$|R
