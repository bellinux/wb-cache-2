5|$|Like other bird-hipped dinosaurs of the Dinosaur Park Formation, Gryposaurus {{appears to}} have only existed {{for part of the}} {{duration}} of time that the rocks were being formed. As the formation was being laid down, it recorded a change to more marine-influenced conditions. Gryposaurus is absent from {{the upper part of the}} formation, with Prosaurolophus present instead. Other dinosaurs known from only the lower part of the formation include the horned Centrosaurus and the hollow-crested <b>duckbill</b> Corythosaurus. Gryposaurus may have preferred river-related settings.|$|E
5|$|The three named {{species of}} Gryposaurus differ in {{details of the}} skull and lower jaw. The {{prominent}} nasal arch found in this genus is formed from the paired nasal bones. In profile view, they rise into a rounded hump {{in front of the}} eyes, reaching a height as tall as the highest point {{of the back of the}} skull. The skeleton is known in great detail, making it a useful point of reference for other <b>duckbill</b> skeletons.|$|E
50|$|Arkharavia {{lived in}} the Amur Region, which was a 'hot spot' for dinosaurs in Russia. Other dinosaurs from the area include the lambeosaurines (hollow-crested <b>duckbills)</b> Amurosaurus, Olorotitan, and Charonosaurus, and the saurolophine (<b>duckbills</b> without hollow crests) Kerberosaurus and Wulagasaurus.|$|R
50|$|The Percophidae, <b>duckbills,</b> are {{a family}} of perciform fishes found in {{tropical}} and subtropical waters of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans and in the southwestern and southeastern Pacific.|$|R
500|$|Hypacrosaurus is {{most easily}} {{distinguished}} from other hollow-crested <b>duckbills</b> (lambeosaurines) by its tall neural spines and {{the form of}} its crest. The neural spines, which project {{from the top of}} the vertebrae, are 5 to 7 times the height of the body of their respective vertebrae in the back, which would have given it a tall back in profile. The skull's hollow crest is like that of Corythosaurus, but is more pointed along its top, not as tall, wider side to side, and has a small bony point at the rear. Unlike other lambeosaurines, the passages for the airways do not form an S-curve in the crest (at least not in H. altispinus). The animal is estimated to have been around [...] long, and to have weighed up to 4.0tonnes (4.4tons). As with most <b>duckbills,</b> its skeleton is otherwise not particularly remarkable, although some pelvic details are distinctive. Like other <b>duckbills,</b> it was a bipedal/quadrupedal herbivore. The two known species, H. altispinus and H. stebingeri, are not differentiated in the typical method, of unique characteristics, as H. stebingeri was described as transitional between the earlier Lambeosaurus and later Hypacrosaurus. Photographs of an adult H. stebingeri skull show an animal that looks very similar to H. altispinus.|$|R
5|$|Well-known {{paleontologist}} Barnum Brown {{recovered a}} <b>duckbill</b> skull in 1915 for the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH 5836) from the Red Deer River of Alberta, near Steveville. He described the specimen in 1916 {{as a new}} genus, Prosaurolophus. Brown's choice of name comes from a comparison to the genus Saurolophus, which he had described in 1912. Saurolophus had a similar but longer and more spike-like head crest. The skull had a damaged muzzle and was inadvertently reconstructed too long, but better remains were soon found that showed the true shape; one is a nearly complete skeleton and skull, described by William Parks in 1924. Twenty to twenty-five individuals are known for this species, including seven skulls with {{at least some of}} the rest of the skeleton.|$|E
5|$|Gryposaurus {{is based}} on {{specimen}} NMC 2278, a skull and partial skeleton collected in 1913 by George F. Sternberg from what {{is now known as}} the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, along the Red Deer River. This specimen was described and named by Lawrence Lambe shortly thereafter, Lambe drawing attention to its unusual nasal crest. A few years earlier, Barnum Brown had collected and described a partial skull from New Mexico, which he named Kritosaurus. This skull was missing the snout, which had eroded into fragments; Brown restored it after the <b>duckbill</b> now known as Anatotitan, which was flat-headed, and believed that some unusual pieces were evidence of compression. Lambe's description of Gryposaurus provided evidence of a different type of skull configuration, and by 1916 the Kritosaurus skull had been redone with a nasal arch and both Brown and Charles Gilmore had proposed that Gryposaurus and Kritosaurus were one and the same. This idea was reflected in William Parks's naming of a nearly complete skeleton from the Dinosaur Park Formation as Kritosaurus incurvimanus, not Gryposaurus incurvimanus (although he left Gryposaurus notabilis in its own genus). Direct comparison between Kritosaurus incurvimanus and Gryposaurus notabilis is hindered {{by the fact that the}} incurvimanus type specimen is missing the front part of the skull, so the full shape of the nasal arch cannot be seen. The 1942 publication of the influential Lull and Wright monograph on hadrosaurs sealed the Kritosaurus/Gryposaurus question for nearly fifty years in favor of Kritosaurus. Reviews beginning in the 1990s, however, called into question the identity of Kritosaurus navajovius, which has limited material for comparison with other duckbills. Thus, Gryposaurus has once again been separated, at least temporarily, from Kritosaurus.|$|E
25|$|Exhaust valves are {{necessary}} to prevent the diver inhaling water, and to allow a negative pressure difference to be induced over the diaphragm to control the demand valve. The exhaust valves should operate at a very small pressure difference, and cause as little resistance to flow as reasonably possible, without being cumbersome and bulky. Elastomer mushroom valves serve the purpose adequately, though <b>duckbill</b> valves were also common in twin-hose regulators. Where {{it is important to}} avoid leaks back into the regulator, such as when diving in contaminated water, a system of two sets of valves in series can reduce the risk of contamination. A more complex option which can be used for surface supplied helmets, is to use a reclaim exhaust system which uses a separate flow regulator to control the exhaust which is returned to the surface in a dedicated hose in the umbilical.|$|E
5|$|Styracosaurus {{is known}} from the Dinosaur Park Formation, {{and was a member}} of a diverse and {{well-documented}} fauna of prehistoric animals that included horned relatives such as Centrosaurus and Chasmosaurus, <b>duckbills</b> such as Prosaurolophus, Lambeosaurus, Gryposaurus, Corythosaurus, and Parasaurolophus, tyrannosaurids Gorgosaurus, Daspletosaurus, and armored Edmontonia and Euoplocephalus.|$|R
5000|$|Naashoibitosaurus is a saurolophine hadrosaurid, a [...] "flat-headed or solid-crested duckbill". It is {{closest to}} the solid-crested forms like Saurolophus. If {{it is the same}} as Kritosaurus, Kritosaurus would be used because it is the older name, but its {{position}} vis-a-vis other <b>duckbills</b> would be the same.|$|R
50|$|Dong {{regarded}} this genus as {{much like}} Edmontosaurus, albeit in tiny form. However, Michael K. Brett-Surman, a hadrosaur specialist, regarded the material as showing no characteristics {{that would allow}} it to be differentiated from other <b>duckbills.</b> The most recent review accepts Brett-Surman's position, and regards Microhadrosaurus as a dubious name.|$|R
500|$|Hypacrosaurus (meaning [...] "near {{the highest}} lizard" [...] , {{because it was}} almost but not quite as large as Tyrannosaurus) was a genus of <b>duckbill</b> dinosaur similar in {{appearance}} to Corythosaurus. Like Corythosaurus, it had a tall, hollow rounded crest, although not as large and straight. It is known from the remains of two species that spanned 75 to 67 million years ago, in the Late Cretaceous of Alberta, Canada, and Montana, United States, and is the latest hollow-crested <b>duckbill</b> known from good remains in North America. It was an obscure genus until the discovery in the 1990s of nests, eggs, and hatchlings belonging to H. stebingeri.|$|E
500|$|Gryposaurus was a saurolophine (hadrosaurine {{of older}} references) hadrosaurid, {{a member of}} the <b>duckbill</b> {{subfamily}} without hollow head crests. The general term [...] "gryposaur" [...] is sometimes used for duckbills with arched nasals. Tethyshadros was once thought to fall into this group as well, before it was described (then known under the nickname [...] "Antonio"). A subfamily, Gryposaurinae, was coined by Jack Horner {{as part of a larger}} revision that promoted Hadrosaurinae to family status, but is not now in use. A rough equivalent is Kritosaurini, as used by Alberto Prieto-MÃ¡rquez. The main difference between the two is and age (Kritosaurus comes from slightly younger rocks than Gryposaurus). Otherwise, the skull of Kritosaurus is incompletely known, lacking most of the bones in front of the eyes, but very similar to that of Gryposaurus.|$|E
5000|$|One end of {{the valve}} is {{stretched}} over the outlet of a supply line, conforming itself {{to the shape of}} the line, usually round. The other end, the <b>duckbill,</b> retains its natural flattened shape. When a fluid is pumped through the supply line and therefore the <b>duckbill,</b> the flattened end opens to permit the pressurized fluid to pass. When pressure is removed, however, the <b>duckbill</b> end returns to its flattened shape, preventing backflow.|$|E

5000|$|By 1942, and the {{publication}} of the influential Lull-Wright monograph on <b>duckbills,</b> its holotype was regarded as [...] "typical of all the genera of hadrosaurian dinosaur", except for the roughened margin that gave it its name, and that they regarded as due to the tooth having not been used (p. 149). The name is no longer in use, except in historical discussions, and is considered a nomen dubium.|$|R
5|$|The {{distinctive}} nasal arch of Gryposaurus, {{like other}} cranial modifications in <b>duckbills,</b> {{may have been}} used for a variety of social functions, such as identification of sexes or species and social ranking. It could also have functioned as a tool for broadside pushing or butting in social contests, and there may have been inflatable air sacs flanking it for both visual and auditory signaling. The top of the arch is roughened in some specimens, suggesting that it was covered by thick, keratinized skin, or that there was a cartilaginous extension.|$|R

500|$|Gryposaurus {{is similar}} to Kritosaurus, and for many years the two {{were thought to be}} synonyms. It is known from {{numerous}} skulls, some skeletons, and even some skin impressions that show it to have had pyramidal scales projecting along the midline of the back. It is most easily distinguished from other <b>duckbills</b> by its narrow arching nasal hump, sometimes described as similar to a [...] "Roman nose," [...] and which may have been used for species or sexual identification, and/or combat with individuals of the same species.

5|$|Although {{the early}} workers in Alberta did not {{recognize}} it at the time, they were finding the remains of juvenile Lambeosaurus as well. These fossils of small-bodied crested <b>duckbills</b> were interpreted as adults of a distinct lineage of hadrosaurids, the subfamily Cheneosaurinae. The first such animal to be named was Trachodon altidens, a left upper jaw (GSC 1092) from the Dinosaur Park Formation described by Lawrence Lambe in 1902. In the same volume, Henry Fairfield Osborn suggested T. altidens could belong to a new genus, which he labelled Didanodon without further discussion. In 2006, Lund and Gates stated that Didanodon altidens was a nomen nudum, without further discussion.|$|R
5|$|Parasaurolophus walkeri, {{from the}} Dinosaur Park Formation, {{was a member}} of a diverse and {{well-documented}} fauna of prehistoric animals, including well-known dinosaurs such as the horned Centrosaurus, Chasmosaurus, and Styracosaurus; fellow <b>duckbills</b> Gryposaurus and Corythosaurus; tyrannosaurid Gorgosaurus; and armored Edmontonia, Euoplocephalus and Dyoplosaurus. It was a rare constituent of this fauna. The Dinosaur Park Formation is interpreted as a low-relief setting of rivers and floodplains that became more swampy and influenced by marine conditions over time as the Western Interior Seaway transgressed westward. The climate was warmer than present-day Alberta, without frost, but with wetter and drier seasons. Conifers were apparently the dominant canopy plants, with an understory of ferns, tree ferns, and angiosperms.|$|R

5000|$|Olorotitan was a genus of lambeosaurine duckbilled dinosaur {{from the}} middle or latest Maastrichtian-age Late Cretaceous, whose remains {{were found in the}} Tsagayan Formation beds of Kundur, Amur Region, Far Eastern Russia. The type, and only species is Olorotitan arharensis whose holotype specimen, {{consisting}} of a nearly complete skeleton, was described by Pascal Godefroit et al. in mid-2003. The generic name Olorotitan means [...] "gigantic swan", while the specific descriptor arharensis refers to the location of the fossil find at Arhara County. Olorotitan is distinct from other crested <b>duckbills</b> by its possession of an unusual crest that points backward and takes on a hatchet or fan-like shape. Its discovery has implications for the diversity of lambeosaurine hadrosaurids.|$|R
5|$|The Dinosaur Park Formation, home to Prosaurolophus maximus, is {{interpreted}} as a low-relief setting of rivers and floodplains that became more swampy and influenced by marine conditions over time as the Western Interior Seaway transgressed westward.

Three more species were named during this period that relate to Lambeosaurus, all in 1935. Sternberg, in the same paper as T. cranibrevis, named a skull and partial skeleton (GSCânow NMCâ8705) L. magnicristatum (corrected to magnicristatus), and a smaller skull (GSCânow NMCâ8703) L. clavinitialis, with a less prominent crest and reduced spine pointing from the back.
