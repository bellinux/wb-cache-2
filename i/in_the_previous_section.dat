5|$|Since exp(1) {{is equal}} to e and exp(x) {{satisfies}} this exponential identity, it immediately follows that exp(x) coincides with the repeated-multiplication definition of e'x for integer x, and it also follows that rational powers denote (positive) roots as usual, so exp(x) coincides with the e'x definitions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section</b> for all real x by continuity.|$|E
5|$|The {{derivation}} outlined <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section</b> {{contains all}} the information needed to define general relativity, describe its key properties, and address a question of crucial importance in physics, namely how the theory {{can be used for}} model-building.|$|E
5|$|As a result, most geysers form {{in places}} where there is {{volcanic}} rhyolite rock which dissolves in hot water and forms mineral deposits called siliceous sinter, or geyserite, along {{the inside of the}} plumbing systems which are very slender. Over time, these deposits strengthen the channel walls by cementing the rock together tightly, thus enabling the geyser to persist, as mentioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E
30|$|Finally, {{we provide}} some {{examples}} to illustrate <b>the</b> conclusions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{approximate}} solutions introduced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>sections</b> will {{be illustrated}} with some examples.|$|R

5|$|Between the two {{unstable}} regimes mentioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section,</b> and {{influenced by}} all the factors described above that contribute to balance (trail, mass distribution, gyroscopic effects, etc.), {{there may be a}} range of forward speeds for a given bike design at which these effects steer an uncontrolled bike upright. It has been proven that neither gyroscopic effects nor positive trail are sufficient by themselves or necessary for self-stability, although they certainly can enhance hands-free control.|$|E
5|$|Special {{relativity}} {{is defined}} {{in the absence of}} gravity, so for practical applications, it is a suitable model whenever gravity can be neglected. Bringing gravity into play, and assuming the universality of free fall, an analogous reasoning as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section</b> applies: there are no global inertial frames. Instead there are approximate inertial frames moving alongside freely falling particles. Translated into the language of spacetime: the straight time-like lines that define a gravity-free inertial frame are deformed to lines that are curved relative to each other, suggesting that the inclusion of gravity necessitates a change in spacetime geometry.|$|E
25|$|These are in {{addition}} to the 'free' pieces mentioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section.</b>|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> {{material}} proposed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>sections</b> can {{be summarized}} for system implementation as follows.|$|R
30|$|This section {{presents}} the performance {{obtained for the}} quality control algorithm proposed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{complexities}} of the style mentioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section</b> make it unreadable by the average Japanese person without dedicated study {{of the language of}} the tale.|$|E
25|$|Authors {{for whom}} finite {{differences}} mean finite difference approximations define the forward/backward/central differences as the quotients given {{in this section}} (instead of employing the definitions given <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section).</b>|$|E
30|$|In this section, {{we present}} {{numerical}} experiments to illustrate theoretical results obtained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>sections.</b>|$|R
30|$|As {{applications}} of our main results established <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>sections,</b> we consider <b>the</b> following examples.|$|R

25|$|When k = n or n1 we saw <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section</b> that V'k(Fn) is a {{principal}} homogeneous space, and therefore diffeomorphic to the corresponding classical group. These {{are listed in the}} table at the right.|$|E
25|$|Notice that {{by using}} the fact that any set of linearly {{independent}} vectors can be completed to a basis, we implicitly used the axiom of choice, which was not needed for the concrete example <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section</b> but one.|$|E
25|$|Overfishing higher trophic {{levels that}} {{naturally}} regulate herbivore populations is also {{recognized as an}} important stressor in kelp forests. As described <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section,</b> the drivers and outcomes of trophic cascades are important for understanding spatial-temporal patterns of kelp forests.|$|E

30|$|The {{differences}} between problem and solution citations presented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>sections</b> {{can be observed}} in Figure 9.|$|R
25|$|Most {{of these}} axioms have {{alternative}} definitions {{with the same}} meaning; the definitions given here fall into a consistent pattern that relates the various notions of separation defined <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section.</b> Other possible definitions {{can be found in}} the individual articles.|$|E
25|$|The crucial {{aspect of}} an {{interpretation}} {{is whether the}} elements of I are regarded as physically real. Hence the bare instrumentalist view of quantum mechanics outlined <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section</b> is not an interpretation at all, for it makes no claims about elements of physical reality.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the three breeds mentioned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section,</b> Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs are related to other mountain dogs: Boxers, Bullmastiffs, Doberman Pinschers, Great Danes, Great Pyrenees, Komondors, Kuvaszes and Mastiffs.

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section,</b> {{a surface}} {{is defined as}} a topological space with certain properties, namely Hausdorff and locally Euclidean.

25|$|As noted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section</b> the {{magnitude}} of a simple bivector, that {{is one that is}} the exterior product of two vectors a and b, is |a||b|sin θ, where θ is the angle between the vectors. It is written |B|, where B is the bivector.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{spectral}} theorem for self-adjoint operators {{may take}} several equivalent forms. Notably, {{all of the}} formulations given <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>previous</b> <b>section</b> for bounded self-adjoint operators—the projection-valued measure version, the multiplication-operator version, and the direct-integral version—continue to hold for unbounded self-adjoint operators, with small technical modifications to deal with domain issues.|$|E
