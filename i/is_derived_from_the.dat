5|$|As a {{component}} of the female reproductive system, the cervix <b>is</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> two paramesonephric ducts (also called Müllerian ducts), which develop around the sixth week of embryogenesis. During development, the outer parts of the two ducts fuse, forming a single urogenital canal that will become the vagina, cervix and uterus. The cervix grows in size at a smaller rate than the body of the uterus, so the relative size of the cervix over time decreases, decreasing from being much larger than the body of the uterus in fetal life, twice as large during childhood, and decreasing to its adult size, smaller than the uterus, after puberty. Previously it was thought that during fetal development, the original squamous epithelium of the cervix <b>is</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> urogenital sinus and the original columnar epithelium <b>is</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> paramesonephric duct. The point at which these two original epithelia meet is called the original squamocolumnar junction. New studies show, however, that all the cervical as well as large part of the vaginal epithelium are derived from Müllerian duct tissue and that phenotypic differences might be due to other causes.|$|E
5|$|Grimaldi and Engel, {{reviewing}} the phylogeny in 2005, commented that many cladistic studies {{had been made}} with no stability in Ephemeroptera suborders and infraorders; the traditional division into Schistonota and Pannota was wrong because Pannota <b>is</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Schistonota.|$|E

5|$|M. l. leuconotus is {{endemic to}} {{mainland}} Australia and distinct {{in that it}} is the only subspecies to have nuptial males that show prominent blue-and-white plumage.

5|$|Michaelis–Menten {{kinetics}} {{relies on}} the law of mass action, which <b>is</b> <b>derived</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> assumptions of free diffusion and thermodynamically driven random collision. Many biochemical or cellular processes deviate significantly from these conditions, because of macromolecular crowding and constrained molecular movement. More recent, complex extensions of the model attempt to correct for these effects.|$|E
