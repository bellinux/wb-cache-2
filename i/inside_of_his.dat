5|$|<b>Inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> chansons, {{he often}} used a cantus firmus, {{sometimes}} a popular song whose origin {{can no longer}} be traced, as in Si j'avoye Marion. Other times he used a tune originally associated with a separate text; and still other times he freely composed an entire song, using no apparent external source material. Another technique he sometimes used was to take a popular song and write it as a canon with itself, in two inner voices, and write new melodic material above and around it, to a new text: he used this technique in one of his most famous chansons, Faulte d'argent ("The problem with money"), a song sung by a man who wakes in bed with a prostitute, broke and unable to pay her.|$|E

25|$|In Death of a Salesman – {{originally}} entitled “The <b>Inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>His</b> Head” – Miller brilliantly {{solves the}} problem of revealing his main character's inner discord, rendering Willy Loman as solid as the society in which he tries to sell himself. Indeed, many critics believe that Miller has never surpassed his achievement in this play, which stands as his breakthrough work, distinguished by an extremely long Broadway run, by many revivals, and by many theater awards, including the Pulitzer Prize in 1949. Death of a Salesman seems destined to remain an American classic and a standard text in American classrooms.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1999, two unarmed black motorists, Robert Russ and LaTanya Haggerty, were both fatally shot in {{separate}} incidents involving the Chicago Police. In the first incident, Russ, an honor student and star football player for Northwestern University, was shot <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car. This followed a high-speed chase and what the police claim was a struggle with the officer who shot him. In the second, Haggarty, a computer analyst, was shot by a female officer. Charges of racism against the CPD persisted, {{despite the fact that}} officers in both incidents were also black. Both shootings resulted in lawsuits and Haggerty's family reached an $18 million settlement with the city.|$|E
25|$|Paine {{was arrested}} in France on December 28, 1793. Joel Barlow was {{unsuccessful}} in securing Paine’s release by circulating a petition among American residents in Paris. Sixteen American citizens were allowed to plead for Paine’s release to the Convention, yet President Marc-Guillaume Alexis Vadier of the Committee of General Security refused to acknowledge Paine’s American citizenship, stating he was an Englishman and a citizen of a country at war with France. Paine himself protested and claimed {{that he was a}} citizen of the U.S., which was an ally of Revolutionary France, rather than of Great Britain, which was by that time at war with France. However, Gouverneur Morris, the American minister to France, did not press his claim, and Paine later wrote that Morris had connived at his imprisonment. Paine narrowly escaped execution. A chalk mark was supposed to be left by the gaoler on the door of a cell to denote that the prisoner inside was due to be removed for execution. In Paine's case, the mark had accidentally been made on the <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> door rather than the outside; this was {{due to the fact that}} the door of Paine's cell had been left open whilst the gaoler was making his rounds that day, since Paine had been receiving official visitors. But for this quirk of fate, Paine would have been executed the following morning. He kept his head and survived the few vital days needed to be spared by the fall of Robespierre on 9 Thermidor (July 27, 1794).|$|E

500|$|Due to {{his short}} stature, Messi {{has a lower}} centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility, {{allowing}} him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles; this has led the Spanish media to dub him La Pulga Atómica ("The Atomic Flea"). Despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting. His short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed. His former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola once stated, [...] "Messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it." [...] Although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, Messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> foot to finish and provide passes and assists.|$|E
500|$|By lap 39, Alonso {{had reduced}} the time deficit {{between himself and}} Massa as the latter was lapping the two Virgin cars. At the start of lap 40, Massa held a 1.2 second lead over Alonso, who in turn, was 5.2 seconds in front of Vettel. Hamilton in fourth place was 18.1 seconds behind the race, but was {{maintaining}} a steady gap to teammate Button in fifth. Webber was told by Red Bull over the radio {{to increase the gap}} to Button, because his car was suffering from an issue with its oil consumption, and was told that braking harder into the track's turns would possibly assist in moving some oil around the <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car. Petrov made an error which allowed Kobayashi to take advantage but Petrov held off the challenge. A radio transmission from Massa's race engineer Rob Smedley was intercepted on lap 48, with Smedley telling Massa, [...] "OK, so, Fernando (Alonso) is faster than you. Can you confirm you understood that message?" [...] Based on Smedley's tone, commentators surmised that it had been a coded message from engineer to driver telling Massa to move over and allow Alonso through.|$|E
500|$|St Francis lived austerely, in {{imitation}} of Christ. He embraced the natural world, and took vows of poverty, charity and chastity. In 1224 at La Verna, he experienced the mystical vision which van Eyck portrays. Thomas of Celano, author of Francis's hagiography, describes the vision and stigmatization: [...] "Francis had a vision in which he saw a man like a seraph: he had six wings and was standing above him with his hands outstretched and his feet bound together, and was fixed to a cross. Two wings were lifted above his head, and two were spread ready for flight, and two covered his whole body. When Francis saw this he was utterly amazed. He could not fathom what this vision might mean." [...] As he meditated, [...] "marks of nails began to appear {{on his hands and}} feet... His hands and feet seemed to be pierced by nails appearing on the <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hands and the upper side of his feet... His right side was scarred {{as if it had been}} pierced by a spear, and it often seeped blood." [...] To the medieval observer, the appearance of the stigmata signifies Francis's complete absorption in the vision of the seraph.|$|E

500|$|To aid in {{the visual}} aspect of production, David Siller {{recruited}} Joe Pearson of Epoch Ink, who in turn recommended that Charles Zembillas of American Exitus be brought on board as well. Pearson and Zembillas would meet with Naughty Dog weekly to create the characters and environments of the game. Because the main character was Tasmanian, {{it was decided that}} the game would take place on a mysterious island where every possible type of environment could be found, with the added reasoning that an evil genius like Doctor Neo Cortex would require an island stronghold. On creating the levels for the game, Pearson first sketched each environment, designing and creating additional individual elements later. Pearson aimed for an organic, overgrown look to the game and worked to completely avoid straight lines and 90-degree corners. In January 1995, Rubin became concerned about the programmer-to-artist ratio and hired Bob Rafei and Taylor Kurosaki as additional artists. A Naughty Dog artist sketched every single background object in the game before it was modeled. Naughty Dog's artists were tasked with making the best use of textures and reducing the amount of geometry. Dark and light elements were juxtaposed to create visual interest and separate geometry. The artists would squint when sketching, texturing, and playing the levels to make sure they could be played by light value alone. They ensured to use color correctly by choosing mutually accentuating colors as the theme for the [...] "Lost City" [...] and [...] "Sunset Vista" [...] levels. The interior of Cortex's castle was designed to reflect the <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mind. According to Rubin, the artists worked on the visuals for eight months before any game code was written.|$|E
