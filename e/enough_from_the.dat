5|$|Bond novelist Raymond Benson {{wrote his}} {{adaptation}} of The World Is Not <b>Enough</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> film's screenplay. It was Benson's fourth Bond novel {{and followed the}} story closely, but with some details changed. For instance, Elektra sings quietly before her death and Bond still carries his Walther PPK instead of the newer P99. The novel also gave the cigar girl/assassin the name Giulietta da Vinci and retained a scene between her and Renard that was cut from the film.|$|E
5|$|Although to date most KBOs still appear spectrally featureless due {{to their}} faintness, {{there have been a}} number of successes in {{determining}} their composition. In 1996, Robert H. Brown et al. acquired spectroscopic data on the KBO 1993 SC, which revealed that its surface composition is markedly similar to that of Pluto, as well as Neptune's moon Triton, with large amounts of methane ice. For the smaller objects, only colors and in some cases the albedos have been determined. These objects largely fall into two classes: gray with low albedos, or very red with higher albedos. The difference in colors and albedos is hypothesized to be due to the retention or the loss of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on the surface of these objects, with the surfaces of those that formed far <b>enough</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sun to retain H2S being reddened due to irradiation.|$|E
5|$|Having {{recovered}} <b>enough</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{events of}} the previous episode, Olivia is released from the hospital, and is watched by the shapeshifter who has killed Charlie Francis (Kirk Acevedo) and adopted his appearance. Peter (Joshua Jackson) learns of mysterious disappearances taking place in Lansdale, and the Fringe team arrives to investigate. Walter finds a blue, paralytic substance at the scene, which he suspects is from mutated DNA. The investigation leads to a local resident, Andre Hughes (John Savage), who tells them he lost his wife and baby in childbirth. Olivia begins to develop super-hearing {{as a result of}} crossing to the parallel universe, and hears someone else in Hughes' house despite his saying he's the only one there. She ventures upstairs to investigate; after failing to find anything, she accidentally fires her weapon, narrowly missing Peter. They bring Hughes in for questioning, and he refuses to give them a blood sample for their investigation.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summers}} of 1843 and 1844 Słowacki {{traveled}} to Pornic, a resort on the Atlantic coast in Brittany. It was there, in 1844, {{that he wrote}} Genezis z Ducha (Genesis from the Spirit). This work introduced his own philosophical system {{that would have a}} visible influence on his works in his last decade. Around 1839 Słowacki put his capital into the Parisian stock market. He was a shrewd investor who earned <b>enough</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> investments to dedicate his life to his literary career; he was also able to pay the costs of having his books published.|$|E
5|$|The plugs-out test {{began on}} the morning of January 27, 1967, and {{immediately}} was plagued with problems. First the crew noticed a strange odor in their spacesuits, which delayed the sealing of the hatch. Then, communications problems frustrated the astronauts and forced a hold in the simulated countdown. During this hold, an electrical fire began in the cabin, and spread quickly in the high pressure, 100% oxygen atmosphere. Pressure rose high <b>enough</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fire that the cabin inner wall burst, allowing the fire to erupt onto the pad area and frustrating attempts to rescue the crew. The astronauts were asphyxiated before the hatch could be opened.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{somewhat}} reddish Pluto and Triton, Eris appears almost white. Pluto's reddish color {{is thought to}} be due to deposits of tholins on its surface, and where these deposits darken the surface, the lower albedo leads to higher temperatures and the evaporation of methane deposits. In contrast, Eris is far <b>enough</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sun that methane can condense onto its surface even where the albedo is low. The condensation of methane uniformly over the surface reduces any albedo contrasts and would cover up any deposits of red tholins.|$|E

5|$|Picard {{is joined}} by some of his crew to help the Ba'ku escape from being {{abducted}} while Riker takes the Enterprise far <b>enough</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> interference zone to communicate the violation to Starfleet. The Son'a send robotic probes to locate and capture the fleeing Ba'ku. The Son'a leader, Ahdar Ru'afo (F. Murray Abraham), convinces Dougherty to allow two Son'a ships to attack the Enterprise. Riker defeats the attacking ships and the Enterprise escapes. Their plan exposed, Ru'afo insists upon harvesting the radiation source immediately. Picard, Anij, and several Ba'ku are transported as prisoners onto the Son'a ship. Picard reveals to Dougherty that the Son'a and the Ba'ku are the same race and involving the Federation in a blood feud. The Son'a are a splinter faction of Ba'ku who gave up their bucolic existence a century earlier to embrace the use of technology. They attempted to seize power but failed, and the Ba'ku elders exiled them from the planet, denying them the rejuvenating effects of the rings. The Son'a developed an artificial and imperfect means to extend their lives {{at the cost of}} disfigurement. Ru'afo kills Admiral Dougherty when he backs out of the plan and Ru'afo proceeds with his plan.|$|E

25|$|In effect, La Rochelle was {{surrounded}} efficiently enough, and suffered <b>enough</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> siege, with harbour facilities being damaged by Allied air attacks, that the Germans {{were unable to}} launch major U-Boat attacks on Allied shipping {{for the duration of}} the siege. However, every week a Luftwaffe plane was able to break through the blockade and supply the garrison.

25|$|At the {{outskirts}} of towns, between the exits of the rings roads, and the car-free zones in the city center themselves, additional car parking lots can be added, generally {{in the form of}} underground car parks (to avoid it taking up surface space).
