5|$|On 26 October 1952, the Comet {{suffered}} {{its first}} hull loss when a BOAC flight departing Rome's Ciampino airport failed to become airborne {{and ran into}} rough ground {{at the end of}} the runway. Two passengers sustained minor injuries, and the aircraft, G-ALYZ, was a total loss. On 3 March 1953, a new Canadian Pacific Airlines Comet 1A, registered CF-CUN and named Empress of Hawaii, failed to become airborne while attempting a night takeoff from Karachi, Pakistan, on a <b>delivery</b> <b>flight</b> to Australia. The aircraft plunged into a dry drainage canal and collided with an embankment, killing all five crew and six passengers on board. The accident was the first fatal jetliner crash, as well as the Comet's first accident to result in fatalities. In response, Canadian Pacific cancelled its remaining order for a second Comet 1A and never operated the type in commercial service.|$|E
25|$|Flight {{testing of}} the Rs.III carried on apace from November 1917, at the Lake Constance factory, with good results. Flying {{characteristics}} were generally good, the aircraft proving easy to fly, taxi on water, and capable of taking off in moderate seas. With only minor modifications, the Rs.III was ready for its <b>delivery</b> <b>flight</b> {{by the end of}} January 1918, but the route was covered with fog. The weather cleared by 19 February when the Rs.III set off on its 7-hour non-stop <b>delivery</b> <b>flight</b> to Norderney.|$|E

500|$|Koch finally {{achieved}} {{his ambition}} of joining {{what was then}} known as Qantas Empire Airways (QEA) with an appointment on 4 July 1938. The Singapore service commenced on 2 August 1938 (the westbound service was [...] "officially" [...] opened on 4 August). In the arcane language of QEA, he was promoted from [...] "Extra Mate" [...] to [...] "Senior Mate" [...] in October 1940. This allowed him to fly as relief Captain on the Singapore service.

QEA was intimately involved in the war effort almost from its beginning, and in late 1940 was contracted to fly 19 PBY5 Catalinas from Honolulu to Australia {{on behalf of the}} RAAF. By a convenience, the crews were regarded as civilians (to meet American diplomatic niceties) for this operation, but on other RAAF contracts, particularly to combat zones, they were seen as serving in the RAAF Reserve. Brain, Koch and P. G [...]Taylor flew the final <b>delivery</b> <b>flight</b> of the Catalina ferry, arriving in Sydney on 24 October 1941, for the first time via Suva, Fiji. This crew determined to commemorate their mission by flying the first Airmail delivery between Fiji and Australia, and to that end they had a large number of [...] "First Day Covers" [...] (but without Airmail stamps) endorsed by the Suva Post Office prior to departure, and by the Sydney Post Office on arrival (some examples of what became collector's items are held by the Qantas Museum). They also transported 200 pounds weight of ordinary mail on behalf of the Fiji postal authorities. This plan led to a serious contretemps with Pan American, which had the contract to convey the air mail from Fiji but was not due to start operations until 9 November 1941.|$|E
