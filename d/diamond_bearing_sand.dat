40|$|Methane gas {{hydrates}} are crystalline compounds {{formed from}} water and methane under certain pressure and temperature. They are mostly found in marine continental margin sediments {{and beneath the}} permafrost and considered as the future non-conventional energy resource. In order to develop innovative techniques for the safe extraction of methane gas from Methane Hydrate (MH) {{it is important to}} understand the shear behaviour of methane hydrate <b>bearing</b> <b>sand.</b> It has been reported that the pore scale habits of MH have a significant influence on the shear behaviour of methane hydrate <b>bearing</b> <b>sand.</b> In this paper, an attempt has been made to capture the effect of pore scale habits on the shear behaviour of methane hydrate <b>bearing</b> <b>sand</b> using the Discrete Element Method. Two modelling approaches (i) pore filling, leading to load bearing, and (ii) cementation, bonding of the interparticle contact, have been simulated using PFC 3 D. A series of triaxial monotonic tests were carried on an assembly of particles for different methane hydrate saturations. Both the approaches have captured, qualitatively, the stress ratio- axial strain behaviour similar to the laboratory experiments. The DEM simulation results highlight that MH saturation has a profound influence on the shear behaviour of hydrate <b>bearing</b> <b>sand.</b> It was shown that the cementation habit closely captures the variation of peak deviator stress with MH saturation similar to the laboratory experiments.

40|$|GS- 11 sand of Gandhar {{which is}} oil {{producer}} in North eastern and North {{western part of}} the field is having varying electrical property. The electrical resistivity range of hydrocarbon producing interval of this sand varies from 3 ohmm to 300 ohmm., while the range of water producing interval varies from 2 - 9 ohmm. Due to its low resistivity it becomes difficult to identify it’s hydrocarbon bearing potential on normal suit of log. A method has been devised which takes into account of acoustic impedance characteristic of this sand. Theoretical acoustic impedance of the sand is calculated using linear volumetric average formula. This is compared with the actual observed acoustic impedance on the log on a cross plot. As theoretically calculated acoustic impedance assumes the rock as water bearing only, hence in case of hydrocarbon bearing rock it is more than the actual acoustic impedance value. This difference in case of hydrocarbon bearing rock stands out on the crossplot involving the above two impedance values. Hence, the hydrocarbon <b>bearing</b> <b>sand</b> is discriminated against water <b>bearing</b> <b>sand</b> irrespective of their resistivity values...|$|R

The data set utilized for this work incorporate 3 D seismic data, well log suites containing gamma rays, resistivity and porosity logs (neutron and density). These logs were utilized to focus petro-physical properties in three (3) wells. 780 inlines and 496 crosslines of seismic information covering an area of about 234 km 2 were utilized. Faults were picked and correlated. Horizons of hydrocarbon <b>bearing</b> <b>sands</b> were picked {{in view of the}} re-suit from seismic- to-well tie. These were utilized to produce time and depth maps for a horizon keeping in mind the end goal to recognize the different basic highlights inside the field.

The study objectives were to evaluate petrophysical parameters (net-pay thickness, porosity, water saturation and volume of shale) and estimate area extent of all hydrocarbon <b>bearing</b> <b>sands</b> from subsurface mapping and seismic interpretation. The workflow procedures for analysis involved the delineation of six hydrocarbon <b>bearing</b> <b>sands</b> (A, B, C, D, E and F) and {{the determination of}} petrophysical parameters from three well logs, while the 3 -D seismic interpretation involved picking of three growth faults (A, B and C) as well as three antithetic faults(D, E and F). The faults were assigned, and four different horizons were picked along the fault planes cutting through sands A, B, D and E respectively. The horizons were interpolated through series of procedures to create isomap layers and were subsequently gridded and converted to generate both time and depth structure maps. The results from well log analysis showed that Q-field had average values of 114. 5 feet, 21. 0 %, 25. 2 %, and 18. 0 % for the net-pay thickness, porosity, water saturation and volume of shale respectively while 3 -D seismic interpretation showed area estimate of 8, 557. 44 acres, 1, 830. 78 acres, 1, 680. 31 acres, and 2, 035. 17 acres for sands A, B, D and E respectively.
