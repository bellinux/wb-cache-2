5|$|The divine power seems {{originally}} to {{have designed}} Demosthenes and Cicero upon the same plan, giving them many similarities {{in their natural}} characters, as their passion for distinction and their love of liberty in civil life, and their want of courage in dangers and war, {{and at the same}} time also to have added many accidental resemblances. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> can hardly be found two other orators, who, from small and obscure beginnings, became so great and mighty; who both contested with kings and tyrants; both lost their daughters, were driven out of their country, and returned with honor; who, flying from thence again, were both seized upon by their enemies, and at last ended their lives with the liberty of their countrymen.|$|E
25|$|The {{band was}} a lot of fun. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> was great rapport between the people in it. And none of us wanted to leave. We were always getting sort of offers from other bands for much more money than we were making with Woody, and it was always like if you left, you were a rat. You were really letting down the team.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is {{a growing}} distaste for the family duties among women … that should be condemned. The efforts of women to equal man in studies, work, etc., while still {{claiming}} their sex privileges, with the dissolution of club and society life, are leading to a 'race suicide.' This ought not to be. Woman is anatomically, physiologically, and emotionally evolved for one sole and single purpose, any departure therefrom being done at the violation of her best ideals and a misdirection of energy.|$|E

Not that he was murdered, but that there was just a lack of caring for him. <b>I</b> just <b>think</b> that Courtney had moved on, and he was expendable.|$|R

25|$|Contemporary with Hume, but {{critical}} of Hume's scepticism, a so-called Scottish school of Common Sense formed, whose basic principle was enunciated by its founder and greatest figure, Thomas Reid:If {{there are certain}} principles, as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> are, which the constitution of our nature leads us to believe, and which we are under a necessity {{to take for granted}} in the common concerns of life, without being able to give a reason for them — these are what we call the principles of common sense; and what is manifestly contrary to them, is what we call absurd.|$|E
25|$|Berkeley's biographer, J. D. Davies, wrote after {{examining}} his letters that Berkeley {{appears as a}} 'lively, friendly young man, fully aware of his dependence on the patronage of others, supportive of and loving towards his family, and genuinely enthusiastic to make a success of his chosen career', quoting a letter from William to Charles Berkeley in June 1663: I must assure you <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> is no so beggarly a trade as this if people serve truly and honestly, as I am resolved I will do, although I am never worth six pence.

25|$|They {{were pretty}} good sea boats, {{although}} very wet, {{there was a}} saying that they submerged at the Heads and surfaced down at Gabo Island. We worked mainly four on, four off. Turn to, to ‘shoot away’, pick up and store the catch and clean up. We worked bloody long hours. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> were six deckies, four firemen, one engineer, one wireless operator and the master and mate. The galley was right aft with the mess room beneath. You would get your feed, climb down the hatchway to the mess room below. We would get {{a bucket of water}} from the galley to take to the forecastle where we bunked. By the time we got forward we would have only half a bucket of hot water to wash in but after a couple of days you didn’t worry about washing. You were wet through most of the time so it didn’t matter.|$|E

25|$|The {{mark of a}} great cabinetmaker is his {{combination}} of design and execution. It's how well they resolve the challenges of designing a piece coupled with their craftsmanship and technique. Pabst was the most distinguished cabinetmaker in Philadelphia {{in the last quarter}} of the 19th century. Clearly, the quality of his carving and cabinetmaking is of the highest order, and Philadelphia has a tradition of producing superior furniture since the 18th century, overshadowing Boston and New York.Daniel Pabst really did develop a unique and identifiable decorative vocabulary. He tended to envelop the object's architecture with a fine scale pattern; it was an invention of his own. He wasn't aping the European antecedent. While <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> are masterpieces of Pabst's not from Furness's pen, he certainly benefitted from his close association with the architect.Pabst's Modern Gothic work presents the very germ of the modern movement. Like Christopher Dresser and Bruce Talbert, he conventionalized design, departing from the realistic motifs of the mid-19th century. You can see where this reductivity evolves into the Craftsman style.— Andrew Van Styn, furniture scholar & dealer.|$|E

500|$|In 1998, Laurie Brown of the CBC {{criticized the}} Walk of Fame, calling it [...] "just an {{attraction}} to lure tourists to theatres in the area." [...] She claimed {{that it would}} only honour Canadians with international impact, saying [...] "if it was truly for Canadians, then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> would {{be more of a}} national bend to the whole thing.

I {{try to do}} songs that are a bit happier and a bit more complicated. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> are too many songwriters writing sad, depressive songs, and I find it really boring, listening to music where people are just complaining. People should stop whining! I find it much more challenging to make songs that are pop songs, to make happy songs, and that's why I like to do it. I really like to make quite hopeful, happy music {{with a little bit}} of melancholy in it, with a little spice of melancholy." ...|$|E

I went through a lot of personal turmoil right around the time Audioslave formed and unfortunately I think that affected the band a little bit in terms of me not really being grounded.... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> was stuff that could have been resolved, and there was drama that was probably unnecessary, typical rock band stuff.

500|$|Harrison's final studio album for EMI and Apple Records was {{the soul}} music-inspired Extra Texture (Read All About It) (1975). He {{considered}} it the least satisfactory {{of the three}} he had recorded since All Things Must Pass. Leng identified [...] "bitterness and dismay" [...] {{in many of the}} album's tracks; his long-time friend Klaus Voormann commented: [...] "He wasn't up for it... It was a terrible time because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> was a lot of cocaine going around, and that's when I got out of the picture... I didn't like his frame of mind". He released two singles from the LP: [...] "You", which reached the Billboard top 20, and [...] "This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)", Apple's final original single release.|$|E
500|$|Only {{entering}} two European charts, [...] "Flatline" [...] reached number 14 on the Irish Singles Chart, {{however it}} peaked at number 50 on the UK Singles Chart.

Our goal was to put a song out that people liked and we think we've done that". They also expressed preference in going on tour and releasing an album than having a [...] "throw-away hit" [...] on the charts." [...] To NME, Buchanan reiterated those sentiments and denied rumours floating {{at the time that}} speculated that the group had been dropped by Polydor.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after its}} release, {{the book also}} won accolades from other award bodies, {{including}} [...] "Best Historical Single Title Romance" [...] by Romance Readers Anonymous and [...] "Best Historical Romance" [...] by Reader's Voice. In 2014, romance novelist Madeline Hunter recalled Lord of Scoundrels being [...] "the 'must read' of the season" [...] when {{it was published in}} 1995, and described it as [...] "witty, heartfelt, with a flawed hero and an indomitable heroine, [...] pacing so perfect a reader could only hold on for the ride.

500|$|The Naval Academy and the University of Maryland are {{separated}} by about 30 miles {{in the state of}} Maryland. The schools by their nature, a Federal service academy and a public university, differ radically in terms of culture and lifestyle. For many years, the University of Maryland possessed the reputation of a blue-collar, working-class school. Some students viewed the Naval Academy, with its strictly regimented culture, as elitist. A former Terrapins linebacker, Jerry Fishman, believed that many Midshipmen [...] "thought they were far superior to the Maryland redneck coal miners." [...] A former Navy fullback, Pat Donnelly, said that compared to a [...] "public institution, [...] was night and day. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> was a feeling of mutual dislike, but it wasn’t personal, it was more institutional." ...|$|E
500|$|He was not {{a typical}} movie actor, with a pudgy build and lacking matinée idol looks, but Hoffman claimed that he was {{grateful}} for his appearance as it made him believable {{in a wide range}} of roles. Joel Schumacher once said of him in 2000, [...] "The bad news is that Philip won't be a $25-million star. The good news is that he'll work for the rest of his life". The Aiken Standard of South Carolina referred to him as an [...] "anti-star", whose real identity remained [...] "amorphous and unmoored". Hoffman was acutely aware that he was often too unorthodox for the Academy voters. He remarked, [...] "I'm sure that people in the big corporations that run Hollywood don't know quite what to do with someone like me, but that's OK. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> are other people who are interested in what I do." ...|$|E
