5000|$|A {{patch cord}} is always fitted with {{connectors}} at both ends. A pigtail {{is similar to}} a patch cord and is the informal name given to a cable fitted with a connector at one end and bare wires (or bare fibre) at the other. In the context of copper cabling, these cables are sometimes referred to as blunt patch cords and the non-connectorized end ("the pigtail") is intended to be permanently attached to a component or terminal. Optical fiber pigtails, in contrast to copper pigtails, can be more accurately described as a connector than a cable or cord. A <b>fiber</b> <b>pigtail</b> is a single, short, usually tight-buffered, optical fiber that has an optical connector pre-installed on one end and a length of exposed fiber at the other end. The end of the <b>fiber</b> <b>pigtail</b> is stripped and fusion spliced to a single fiber of a multi-fiber trunk. Splicing of pigtails to each fiber in the trunk [...] "breaks out" [...] the multi-fiber cable into its component fibers for connection to the end equipment.|$|E

Polymer fiber Bragg {{gratings}} - Prior to {{the commencement}} of PHOSFOS, gratings in polymer optical fibre (POF) only existed in the 1550 nm spectral region where the large fibre loss (1 dB/cm) only permitted very short (<10 cm) fibre lengths to be used and the devices had to be butt-coupled to a silica <b>fiber</b> <b>pigtail</b> on the optical bench. The PHOSFOS consortium has developed a means for reliably splicing POF to silica fibre and produced the first gratings in the 800 nm spectral region where losses are almost 2 orders of magnitude less than at 1550 nm. These developments have allowed POF grating sensors to be used outside the laboratory for the first time.|$|E

40|$|Optoelectronics (o/e) is {{currently}} {{too expensive for}} widespread application. We believe that the packaging (or <b>fiber</b> <b>pigtailing)</b> process must be automated to realize {{a significant reduction in}} the cost of o. e packages. We are addressing issues of automating the <b>fiber</b> <b>pigtailing</b> process on silicon waferboards or microbenches. This paper focuses on reflowing solders for the attachment of o/e components. We have recently developed miniature polysilicon heaters which are integrated on silicon microbenches. These miniature heaters avoid the problem of raising the entire microbench to the solder melting point to attach components. Most importantly, these miniature heaters are completely compatible with automating the attachment process. Designing silicon microbenches with on-board heaters requires some care. The thermal properties of the microbench itself along with all coatings and any heatsinking materials must be understood. The heaters must operate in a current and voltage regime compatible with the overall characteristics of the o. e package. Inadvertently reflowing solder in unanticipated locations may occur unless the thermal behavior of the microbench thoroughly known.
