40|$|The 2 ̆ 2 impact bias 2 ̆ 2 in affective {{forecasting}} - {{a tendency}} to overestimate the emotional consequences of a particular future event - {{might not be a}} universal phenomenon. This prediction bias occurs in part because of a cognitive process known as focalism, whereby predictors focus attention narrowly on the target event and neglect other mitigating events and circumstances. It was hypothesized that East Asians, because of their holistic tendencies, <b>would</b> <b>be</b> less susceptible to focalism and consequently to the impact bias. These hypotheses were partially supported. In Study 1, participants predicted on a cold day how <b>happy</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> when outdoor temperatures first reached 20 degrees Celsius. When this warmer weather arrived, a comparable sample of participants reported their happiness. In Study 2, participants nominated an upcoming positive event and predicted how <b>happy</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> two weeks later if it occurred. Two weeks later, the same participants reported their actual happiness levels. In both studies, Euro-Canadians exhibited the impact bias, predicting significantly more happiness than they experienced, but Asians did not. The Euro-Canadians predicted greater happiness than Asians, whereas actual happiness levels did not differ across cultures. In addition, a measure of cognitive process revealed that the cultural difference in prediction was mediated by the degree to which participants focused on the target event itself. These results suggest that East Asians are less prone than Westerners to the impact bias, because they focus less on the target event while generating affective forecasts. Although scores on several holism measures were not predictive of focalism or affective forecasts, the results of both studies supported the hypothesized patterns of predicted and experienced happiness as well as confirmed the expected role of focalism...|$|R

50|$|Generally, affect is {{a potent}} source of motivation. People {{are more likely to}} pursue {{experiences}} and achievements that will bring them more pleasure than less pleasure. In some cases, affective forecasting errors appear to be due to forecasters strategic use of their forecasts a means to motivate them to obtain or avoid the forecasted experience. Students, for example, might predict <b>they</b> <b>would</b> devastated if <b>they</b> failed a test as a way to motivate them to study harder for it. The role of motivated reasoning in affective forecasting has been demonstrated in studies by Morewedge and Buechel (2013). Research participants were more likely to overestimate how <b>happy</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> if <b>they</b> won a prize, or achieved a goal, if they made an affective forecast while they could still influence whether or not they achieved it than if they made an affective forecast after the outcome had been determined (while still in the dark about whether they knew if they won the prize or achieved the goal).|$|R

To test the viability of this view, 16 5 - and 16 7 -year-olds played a marble rolling game in which size of the target and distance from it varied factorially. Task difficulty judgements (prior to practical experience with the game) reflected both objective task structure and subsequent performance for both age groups. Children then judged how <b>happy</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> playing games of variable difficulty for different prizes. These judgements had the multiplicative structure predicted by the normative expected value model, again for both age groups. Thus children can use task difficulties as estimates of personal success probability in skill-related tasks. Our findings therefore extend previous work on early probability understanding from games of chance to games of skill...|$|R

More specifically, to examine some factors that may impact parents’ preferences regarding the types of toys their child chooses. The factors of interest used in the present study include general demographics (e. g., gender, age, etc.), gender role perceptions, religiosity, and level of conservatism. Participants were gathered from a survey-taking website. The sample consisted of 88 parents (43 female, 43 male, and 2 who chose not to identify) whose ages ranged from 22 to 62 (M = 31. 82, SD = 6. 95). Each participant was given brief measures to assess for each of the factors of interest. Parents were then asked to identify one of their children to consider throughout the study. They were shown a series of images of toys and asked the likelihood <b>they</b> <b>would</b> purchase that particular toy for their child, as well as how <b>happy</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> if their child were to play with the particular toy.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} dynamic impacts of governmental policy interventions on the economy. In chapter 1, we present an overlapping-generations model with endogenous retirement {{to study the}} effects of PAYG pensions on the capital-labor ratio and welfare in a dynamically efficient economy. In such an environment, we show that it is possible for the PAYG pension system to be neutral. It may even be desirable in a long-run welfare sense. These results are in sharp contrast with existing, well-known results. In chapter 2, we describe a business as usual (BAU) overlapping-generations economy in which pollution is the fallout of productive activity. Over time, conditions in the BAU economy get worse: it gets increasingly polluted, consumption falls and generational welfare levels decline. A government introduces costly pollution abatement in the BAU world and finances it via labor taxes and borrowing on perfect international markets. Pollution levels start to decline and this generates downstream welfare gains which the government can tax away to help pay off the debt, that too, in finite time. A new world emerges; it has lower pollution and higher consumption than in the BAU. More importantly, every generation <b>is</b> <b>happier</b> than <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> had life continued in the BAU world. In chapter 3, using monthly data from Jan 1996 to Dec 2014, we analyze and compare the long-run equilibrium relationship and short-run dynamics in a system of Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index, industrial production growth rate, international crude oil price, real exchange rates growth rate and real interest rate before and after the exchange rate regime shift in July 2005 in China...|$|R

40|$|Early in life, {{people make}} {{education}} and career {{decisions that affect}} their income and wellbeing {{for the rest of}} their lives. Understanding how individuals make these human capital investments helps economists evaluate the efficiency and equity of individual sorting into schools and occupations and predict the pace of labor market adjustment following changes in labor demand. The second chapter of this dissertation estimates the relationship between earnings uncertainty and expected earnings across occupations. Rational, risk-averse workers require higher average compensation to enter occupations where they face greater uncertainty about lifetime earnings. Compensation for earnings risk explains 17 % of the differences in average earnings across occupations, but only a small share of total earnings inequality. Lifetime earnings risk, which is largely uninsurable, creates inefficiencies in the labor market: products become more expensive to cover this compensation, but workers <b>are</b> no <b>happier</b> than <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> with lower, safer earnings. Moreover, workers sort into occupations partially based on their preferences for risk, rather than their relative skills. The third chapter estimates the responsiveness of college enrollment decisions to changes in the relative average earnings of workers with and without a college degree. Growth in the college earnings premium can explain more than half of the 10 percentage point rise from 1980 to 2002 in four-year college enrollment for men. As the relative supply of workers with a college degree rises, some of the recent rise in their relative earnings should be reversed. The fourth chapter studies the causes of mismatch between student ability and college quality, measuring college quality with peer student ability and resources per student. Additional wealth and information about college lower the probability that a student will attend a college of low quality relative to their ability and raise the probability that she will attend a relatively high quality college. Programs that provide information about college to less informed students may increase the equity of student sorting into colleges. However, if all well-informed students seek to attend the highest quality colleges, only increasing the overall quality of the college stock can improve welfare...|$|R
40|$|Ever {{since the}} advent of {{advanced}} commercial societies in the West, writers and thinkers have speculated upon and theorised about the relationship between status and happiness. For example, in the eighteenth century, Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued that the principal source of human unhappiness was our tendency to make invidious comparisons with each other when isolated individuals in the presocial state of nature were forced together by circumstances. This increased proximity fuelled competition for standing in the eyes of others which is the origin of the pervasive unhappiness that he believed was one of the hallmarks of modern civilisation. I argue that this account is partly correct and partly incorrect. On the one hand, there is now substantial credible evidence that supports the view that relative position matters much more to individuals than do absolute levels of wealth. The competition for status that Rousseau saw as a defining feature of modern civilisation has left {{the vast majority of people}} much less <b>happy</b> than <b>they</b> <b>would</b> otherwise <b>be</b> by fostering costly expenditure arms races that reduce objective welfare and significantly increase stress and anxiety. On the other hand, there is also mounting evidence that he was wrong that this situation is unnatural. According to some evolutionary biologists, human beings evolved in an environment of scarcity and intense resource competition, where each individual’s position was closely linked to his/her prospects for survival and reproductive success. For most of human history having high relative standing was instrumental in helping individuals to achieve the objectives they instinctively care most deeply about, namely survival and reproductive success...|$|R
6000|$|But {{to return}} from my long rambling; I say that Virgil having maturely weighed the {{condition}} of the times in which he lived; that an entire liberty was not to be retrieved; that the present settlement had the prospect of a long continuance in the same family or those adopted into it; that he held his paternal estate from the bounty of the conqueror, by whom he was likewise enriched, esteemed, and cherished; that this conqueror, though of a bad kind, was the very best of it; that the arts of peace flourished under him; that all men might <b>be</b> <b>happy</b> if <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> quiet; that now he was in possession of the whole, yet he shared a great part of his authority with the senate; that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> chosen into the ancient offices of the commonwealth, and ruled by the power which he derived from them, and prorogued his government from time to time, still, as it were, threatening to dismiss himself from public cares, which he exercised more for the common good than for any delight he took in greatness-- these things, I say, being considered by the poet, he concluded it to be the interest of his country to be so governed, to infuse an awful respect into the people towards such a prince, by that respect to confirm their obedience to him, and by that obedience to make them happy. This was the moral of his divine poem; honest in the poet, honourable to the emperor (whom he derives from a divine extraction), and reflecting part of that honour on the Roman people (whom he derives also from the Trojans), and not only profitable, but necessary, to the present age, and likely to be such to their posterity. That it was the received opinion that the Romans were descended from the Trojans, and Julius Caesar from Iulus, the son of AEneas, was enough for Virgil, though perhaps he thought not so himself, or that AEneas ever was in Italy, which Bochartus manifestly proves. And Homer (where he says that Jupiter hated the house of Priam, and was resolved to transfer the kingdom to the family of AEneas) yet mentions nothing of his leading a colony into a foreign country and settling there. But that the Romans valued themselves on their Trojan ancestry is so undoubted a truth that I need not prove it. Even the seals which we have remaining of Julius Caesar (which we know to be antique) have the star of Venus over them--though they were all graven after his death--as a note that he was deified. I doubt not but one reason why Augustus should be so passionately concerned for the preservation of the [...] "AEneis," [...] which its author had condemned to be burnt as an imperfect poem by his last will and testament, was because it did him a real service as well as an honour; that a work should not be lost where his divine original was celebrated in verse which had the character of immortality stamped upon it.|$|R

60|$|There is {{a certain}} class of {{difficulties}} which surrounds the sober idealist in all speculations about the not too distant future. These are the cases where the solution believed by most idealists to be universally applicable is for some reason impossible, and is, at the same time, objected to for base or interested motives by all upholders of existing inequalities. The case of Tropical Africa will illustrate what I mean. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> difficult seriously to advocate the immediate introduction of parliamentary government for the natives {{of this part of}} the world, even if it were accompanied by women's suffrage and proportional representation. So far as I know, no one supposes the populations of these regions capable of self- determination, except Mr. Lloyd George. There can be no doubt that, whatever regime may be introduced in Europe, African negroes will {{for a long time to}} come be governed and exploited by Europeans. If the European States became Socialistic, and refused, under a Quixotic impulse, to enrich themselves at the expense of the defenseless inhabitants of Africa, those inhabitants would not thereby gain; on the contrary, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> lose, for <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> handed over to the tender mercies of individual traders, operating with armies of reprobate bravos, and committing every atrocity to which the civilized barbarian is prone. The European governments cannot divest themselves of responsibility in regard to Africa. They must govern there, and the best that can be hoped is that they should govern with a minimum of cruelty and rapacity. From the point of view of preserving the peace of the world, the problem is to parcel out the advantages which white men derive from their position in Africa in such a way that no nation shall feel a sense of injustice. This problem is comparatively simple, and might no doubt be solved on the lines of the war aims of the Inter-Allied Socialists. But it is not this problem which I wish to discuss. What I wish to consider is, how could a Socialist or an Anarchist community govern and administer an African region, full of natural wealth, but inhabited by a quite uncivilized population? Unless great precautions were taken the white community, under the circumstances, would acquire the position and the instincts of a slave-owner. It would tend to keep the negroes down to the bare level of subsistence, while using the produce of their country to increase the comfort and splendor of the Communist community. It would do this with that careful unconsciousness which now characterizes all the worst acts of nations. Administrators <b>would</b> <b>be</b> appointed and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> expected to keep silence as to their methods. Busybodies who reported horrors <b>would</b> <b>be</b> disbelieved, and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> said to be actuated by hatred toward the existing regime and by a perverse love for every country but their own. No doubt, in the first generous enthusiasm accompanying the establishment of the new regime at home, there <b>would</b> <b>be</b> every intention of making the natives <b>happy,</b> but gradually <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> forgotten, and only the tribute coming from their country <b>would</b> <b>be</b> remembered. I do not say that all these evils are unavoidable; I say only that they will not be avoided unless they are foreseen and a deliberate conscious effort is made to prevent their realization. If the white communities should ever reach the point of wishing to carry out as far as possible the principles underlying the revolt against capitalism, they will have to find a way of establishing an absolute disinterestedness in their dealings with subject races. It will be necessary to avoid the faintest suggestion of capitalistic profit in the government of Africa, and to spend in the countries themselves whatever <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> able to spend if they were self-governing. Moreover, it must always be remembered that backwardness in civilization is not necessarily incurable, and that with time even the populations of Central Africa may become capable of democratic self-government, provided Europeans bend their energies to this purpose.|$|R
