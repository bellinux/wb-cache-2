It is also a potential reservoir of the cucumber mosaic virus, Erysiphum cichoraceum (the cucurbit powdery mildew) and Texas root rot. A study found V.thapsus hosts insects from 29 different families. Most of the pests found were western <b>flower</b> <b>thrips</b> (Frankliniella occidentalis), Lygus species such as the tarnished plant bug (L. lineolaris), and various spider mites from the family Tetranychidae.

5|$|Many thrips are pests of {{commercial}} crops {{due to the}} damage caused by feeding on developing flowers or vegetables, causing discoloration, deformities, and reduced marketability of the crop. Some thrips serve as vectors for plant diseases, such as tospoviruses. Over 20 plant-infecting viruses are known to be transmitted by thrips, but perversely, less than a dozen of the described species are known to vector tospoviruses. These enveloped viruses are considered among some of the most damaging of emerging plant pathogens around the world, with those vector species having an outsized impact on human agriculture. Virus members include the tomato spotted wilt virus and the impatiens necrotic spot viruses. The western <b>flower</b> <b>thrips,</b> Frankliniella occidentalis, has spread until it now has a worldwide distribution, and is the primary vector of plant diseases caused by tospoviruses. Their small size and predisposition towards enclosed places makes them difficult to detect by phytosanitary inspection, while their eggs, laid inside plant tissue, are well-protected from pesticide sprays. When coupled with the increasing globalization of trade and the growth of greenhouse agriculture, thrips, unsurprisingly, are among the fastest growing group of invasive species in the world. Examples include F. occidentalis, Thrips simplex, and Thrips palmi.|$|E

40|$|Open Access JournalThe {{first major}} insect pest of cowpea at {{reproductive}} stage is the <b>flower</b> bud <b>thrips</b> (FTh), which, if not controlled, {{is capable of}} causing significant grain yield reduction. Breeding for resistance to FTh in cowpea has been hindered by the quantitative nature of the resistance, and the breakdown of resistance under high insect infestation. The {{purpose of this study}} was to use molecular markers to identify genetic loci associated with the expression of resistance to FTh. A set of 92 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was generated from a cross between susceptible and resistant lines. One hundred and thirty nine markers [134 Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) and 5 cowpea derived microsatellites] were used to construct a linkage map using this set of RILs. The linkage map spans 1620 cM of the cowpea genome and markers were distributed in 11 linkage groups. Average distance between adjacent markers was 9. 6 cM. There were significant associations between 23 DNA markers and resistance to <b>flower</b> bud <b>thrips</b> (P< 0. 05) using single marker analysis. QTLs with effects on resistance were detected in five linkage groups. The QTL on linkage group 3 explained 32. 0 % of the variation for resistance while all the five QTLs together explained 77. 5 %.

40|$|Published online: 29 August 2017 <b>Flower</b> bud <b>thrips,</b> Megalurothrips sjostedti is {{the most}} severe field pest of cowpea that causes massive flower {{abortion}} which eventually results to substantial yield reduction in Africa. There is paucity {{of information on the}} mode of gene actions controlling inheritance of resistance to <b>flower</b> bud <b>thrips</b> in cowpea in the literature. The objectives of study were to assess the genetic variability for thrips resistance among the cowpea germplasm, determined the mode of inheritance of genes that conferred resistance and both broad and narrow-sense heritability estimates for the inheritance of thrips resistance in cowpea. Twelve cowpea lines were used in crosses in the screen house at IITA, Ibadan. The mating was accomplished using North Carolina design II to generate 48 F 1 hybrids, which were eventually evaluated with the parents. Data on number of peduncles, number of pods and number of <b>thrips</b> per <b>flower</b> were recorded and subjected to analysis of variance using random model by SAS 9. 2. Significant variability was observed for most agronomic and thrip-adaptive traits among the cowpea germplasm, parental-lines and F 1 genotypes evaluated. General combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) mean squares were significant (P < 0. 01) for number of pods per plant and other traits under the research environment. The GCA effect accounted for 68. 82 – 80. 07 % of the total variation among hybrids for all traits except days to flowering; SCA explained less than 50 % of the total variation. Narrow-sense heritability estimates ranged from 7. 53 (days to flower) to 63. 92 % (number of peduncles per plant). Additive gene action largely controlled the inheritance of yield components and other traits under thrips infestation and these traits were moderately heritable.

Ten samples each of three plant parts leaf and stem, flower and growing tip samples were collected at weekly intervals, in eleven field plantings in the Lockyer Valley (south-east Queensland, Australia) {{over a three-year period}} from December 2011 to June 2014. There were significantly more F. schultzei than F. occidentalis in lettuce and tomato, and significantly more F. occidentalis than F. schultzei in French beans. Zucchini supported the highest abundance of both species, with no significant difference in mean abundance. Both species displayed similar preferences for different plant parts, with significantly more in flowers compared to leaf and stem and growing tip samples. There were significantly more thrips in female zucchini flowers compared to male <b>flowers.</b> <b>Thrips</b> were present in small numbers one week after planting in all crops, with peak abundance at flowering. F. occidentalis were temporally segregated by crop age (weeks since planting), with significantly higher levels present in zucchini compared to French bean, lettuce and tomato between weeks three and six, followed by significantly higher levels in French bean between weeks eight and ten. F. schultzei were temporally separated by crop age between zucchini and lettuce, with significantly higher levels present in zucchini between weeks four and six, and in lettuce between weeks eight and ten. Implications for crop monitoring are that sampling should be concentrated at pre-flowering for F. occidentalis in French bean and zucchini and for F. schultzei in tomato and zucchini. For lettuce, the seedling stage is most vulnerable to infestation by both species.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a novel strategy for the introduction of durable insect resistance in crops. This strategy was based on intervention in the natural relationship between plants and insects. For many insects, including pests such as thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis), the flower {{is an important factor}} in their life cycle, serving either as a food source or as a place for mating. The insects are attracted to the flower by scent, which is mainly produced by the petals, and by the bright colour of these floral organs. We therefore anticipated that removal or changing the identity of the petals would significantly reduce the attractiveness of the <b>flower</b> to <b>thrips.</b> To test this hypothesis, we used cucumber as a model species because most modern varieties are parthenocarpic, in which the fruit develops without fertilization. The cucumber mutant green petals, in which the petals are homeotically transformed into green sepals, was particularly useful for this study. The susceptibility of the cucumber plants to damage by thrips was determined by recording thrip numbers and by measuring leaf damage. Large differences were observed when greenhouse compartments with either wild-type or green petal mutant plants were compared. The rate of population growth of the insects on the mutant plants was significantly reduced and the leaves were almost undamaged.

Each sample consisted of 25 flowers taken at random; only at Prepuna a complementary sampling of three hits per plant (n= 10 plants) was conducted. Observations were made on oviposition sites, admission to the flower, pupation sites, feeding behavior and injuries caused. In Prepuna, the Thysanoptera complex consisted of Frankliniella australis, F. occidentalis, F. gemina, F. schultzei and Thrips tabaci; in Puna, the specific diversity was restricted to F. australis and F. gemina. Although the planting-harvest period in both areas did not match, the fluctuations in populations showed the same pattern: as flowering progressed, the number of thrips coincided with the availability of food resources. In both areas, F. australis was the dominant species and maintained successive populations; it layed eggs in flower buds, and larvae hatched when flowers opened; feeding larvae and adults brought about silvery stains with black spots. In Prepuna, F. australis went through the mobile immature stages on flowers, while quiescent stages were on the ground; in the Puna, all development stages took place within the <b>flowers.</b> <b>Thrips</b> tabaci, F. shultzei, F. occidentalis and F. gemina were temporary and opportunistic in Prepuna, while the presence of F. gemina was sporadic in Puna.

60|$|As it is {{impossible}} to exclude such minute pollen-carrying insects as <b>Thrips,</b> <b>flowers</b> which it was intended to fertilise with their own pollen may sometimes have been afterwards crossed with pollen brought by these insects from another flower on the same plant; but as we shall hereafter see, a cross of this kind does not produce any effect, or at most only a slight one. When two or more plants were placed near one another under the same net, as was often done, there is some real though not great danger of the flowers which were believed to be self-fertilised being afterwards crossed with pollen brought by Thrips from a distinct plant. I have said that the danger is not great because I have often found that plants which are self-sterile, unless aided by insects, remained sterile when several plants of the same species were placed under the same net. If, however, the flowers which had been presumably self-fertilised by me were in any case afterwards crossed by Thrips with pollen brought from a distinct plant, crossed seedlings would have been included amongst the self-fertilised; but it should be especially observed that this occurrence would tend to diminish and not to increase any superiority in average height, fertility, etc., of the crossed over the self-fertilised plants.|$|R
