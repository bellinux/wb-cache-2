5|$|Thus, {{it is seen}} in {{the time}} of Emperor Hadrian (r.117–138 CE), the {{punishment}} for parricide was basically made optional, in that the convict might be thrown into the arena instead.

5|$|Each {{episode of}} Quatermass II was telerecorded onto 35mm film during <b>its</b> <b>live</b> transmission, for a {{scheduled}} repeat the following Monday night at 10:15p.m. All six episodes survive intact in the BBC's archives, although the telerecording copies {{in some cases}} suffer from poor quality sound and vision. Owing to either technical or artistic problems, Cartier had some scenes re-performed by the cast immediately following the live performance on the Saturday evening, and these were telerecorded and used to replace the live versions in the Monday night repeats. Quatermass II {{was one of the}} first BBC drama productions to be repeated from a telerecording, rather than having the production re-performed live for any second showing as had been the norm in the past.|$|E

Arsenal were in a successful phase, with this final following recent First Division titles, while Sheffield United were attempting to emulate the success of their rivals Sheffield Wednesday in the tournament the year before. A closely fought first half was followed by a dominant second half by Arsenal, who won by a single goal, scored by Ted Drake in the 74th minute. A media ban by the stadium's bosses caused reporters to fly above the stadium in autogyros to see the match and the BBC experimented with sports commentators for the first time during <b>its</b> <b>live</b> broadcast of the final.|$|E

In addition to the Rex episode, the May 1938 maneuvers conducted a well-publicized mock attack on New York City, and arranged the first voluntary blackout in the United States, also planned by Eaker, during a mock raid on Farmingdale, New York, on 16 May.|$|E
5|$|Earwigs are {{regularly}} preyed upon by birds, {{and like many}} other insect species they are prey for insectivorous mammals, amphibians, lizards, centipedes, assassin bugs, and spiders. European naturalists have observed bats preying upon earwigs. Their primary insect predators are parasitic species of Tachinidae, or tachinid flies, whose larvae are endoparasites. One species of tachinid fly, Triarthria setipennis, has been demonstrated to be successful as a biological control of earwigs for almost a century. Another tachinid fly and parasite of earwigs, Ocytata pallipes, has shown promise as a biological control agent as well. The common predatory wasp, the yellow jacket (Vespula maculifrons), preys upon earwigs when abundant. A small species of roundworm, Mermis nigrescens, is known to occasionally parasitize earwigs that have consumed roundworm eggs with plant matter. At least 26 species of parasitic fungus from the order Laboulbeniales have been found on earwigs. The eggs and nymphs are also cannibalized by other earwigs. A species of tyroglyphoid mite, Histiostoma polypori (Histiostomatidae, Astigmata), are observed on common earwigs, sometimes in great densities; however, this mite feeds on earwig cadavers and not <b>its</b> <b>live</b> earwig transportation. Hippolyte Lucas observed scarlet acarine mites on European earwigs.|$|E

5|$|Hardy {{returned}} from injury on the July 29 episode of Impact Wrestling, making an announcement that his brother, Matt, would face TNA World Heavyweight Champion Ethan Carter III in a Full Metal Mayhem match, in which Matt was unsuccessful. After a brief hiatus, Hardy returned on the August 26 episode of Impact Wrestling, {{where he and}} Matt made an agreement that if Matt would lose his second match against Carter for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, then Jeff would become his personal assistant. Matt was unsuccessful, and Jeff was forced to be Carter's assistant. On the September 21 episode of Impact Wrestling, after refusing to hit Spud, then hitting Carter with a Twist of Fate, Hardy quit as Carter's personal assistant, therefore also (storyline) quitting TNA. On the September 30 episode of Impact Wrestling, TNA President Dixie Carter announced that Hardy would be the special guest referee in the three-way dance TNA World Heavyweight Championship match between Carter, his brother Matt, and Drew Galloway at Bound for Glory. At the event, Hardy turned on Carter by hitting him with a steel chair with Matt hitting the Twist of Fate, thus giving Matt his first TNA World Heavyweight Championship.

He made his televised in-ring debut on the August 24 episode of GFW Impact! in a Gauntlet for the Gold {{match for the}} vacant GFW Global Championship, ending in the final three before being eliminated by eventual winner Eli Drake. The following week, he and Eddie Edwards interrupted Drake and Chris Adonis' championship celebration, {{which led to a}} tag team match on the main event, which Drake and Adonis won. On the September 14 edition of GFW Impact!, Johnny Impact defeated Low Ki to become the number one contender to the GFW Global Championship at Victory Road. After the match, Impact was brutally assaulted by Drake and Adonis. The week after, Impact defended his number one contender status in two matches, defeating both KM and Texano in the same night. At Victory Road, Impact was defeated by Drake and failed to win the GFW Global Championship. After the match, he was attacked by Drake and Adonis but was saved by Garza Jr.. However, {{the two of them were}} assaulted by LAX. On the October 12 episode of Impact!, Impact defeated Garza in a number one contendership match to challenge Eli Drake for the Global Championship in the main event of Bound for Glory.
