Speaking on the anniversary of Kristallnacht, Ernest Michel, a Holocaust survivor who reported on the Nuremberg Trials, speaking as the honorary chairman of the American Gathering of Holocaust Survivors, called on the LDS Church to [...] "implement a mechanism to undo what [...] have done", and declared that the LDS Church had repeatedly violated their agreements, and that talks with Mormon leaders were now ended. Jewish groups, he said, would now turn to {{the court of public opinion}} for justice. Michel called the practice a revision of history that plays into the hands of Holocaust deniers, stating: [...] "They tell me, that my parents' Jewishness has not been altered but ... 100 years from now, <b>how</b> <b>will</b> <b>they</b> be able to guarantee that my mother and father of blessed memory who lived as Jews and were slaughtered by Hitler for no other reason than they were Jews, will someday not be identified as Mormon victims of the Holocaust?" ...|$|E

6000|$|But, O methinks, {{with what}} careful hearts will the damned now {{begin to look}} for their names in this book. Those that, when once the long-suffering of God waited on them, made light of all admonition, and slighted the counsel of making their calling and {{election}} sure: would now give thousands of treasures, that they could but spy their names, though last and least among the sons of God.

Oh! it had been better they had not known, had not professed; yea, better they had never been born; for as Christ said of Judas, so may it be said of these, it had been good for that man if he had never been born; and as Christ says it had been good, so Peter says it had been better.

"Guerrillas" [...] {{is often}} used by such fighters {{themselves}} and by their sympathizers while others (i.e., opposing forces or victims of collateral damage) might call them terrorists (negative) or partisans (positive).

An objective definition {{of the difference between}} [...] "a guerrilla" [...] and [...] "a terrorist" [...] or a [...] "partisan" [...] can be found by identifying who makes up the guerilla force, what their motivations are, and <b>how</b> <b>willing</b> <b>they</b> are to avoid collateral damage.|$|R

50|$|In {{the search}} for the root of {{intimate}} partner violence, intranasal oxytocin was administered to a control group and a group of participants with aggressive tendencies. Participants were then surveyed on <b>how</b> <b>willing</b> <b>they</b> were to engage in 5 behaviors towards their romantic partner. What they found was that oxytocin increased IPV inclinations only among the participants with a predisposition towards aggressive tendencies. Oxytocin decreases trust and prosocial behavior in individuals with interpersonal difficulties. This, coupled with its role in relationship maintenance, illustrates that oxytocin serves to instill a sense of territoriality and protectiveness towards a mate.|$|R
