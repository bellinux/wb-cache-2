40|$|A new {{numerical}} {{method is}} presented {{for the analysis}} of combined natural convection and radiation heat transfer with applications in many engineering situations such as materials processing, combustion and fire research. Because of the recent interest in the low gravity environment of space, attention is devoted to both 1 -g and low-g applications. The two-dimensional mathematical model is represented by a set of coupled nonlinear integro-partial differential equations. Radiative exchange is formulated using the Discrete Exchange Factor method (DEF). This method considers point to point exchange and provides accurate results over a wide range of radiation parameters. Numerical results show that radiation significantly influences the flow and heat transfer in both low-g and 1 -g applications. In the low-g environment, convection is weak, and radiation can easily become the dominant heat transfer mode. It is also shown that volumetric <b>heating</b> <b>by</b> <b>radiation</b> gives rise to an intricate cell pattern in the top heated enclosure...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} results of high {{resolution}} SPH simulations {{of the evolution of}} gravitationally unstable protoplanetary disks. We report on calculations in which the disk is evolved using a locally isothermal or adiabatic equation of state (with shock heating), and also on new simulations in which cooling and <b>heating</b> <b>by</b> <b>radiation</b> are explicitly modeled. We find that disks with a minimum Toomre parameter < 1. 4 fragment into several gravitationally bound protoplanets with masses from below to a few Jupiter masses. This is confirmed also in runs where the disk is given a quiet start, growing gradually in mass over several orbital times. A cooling time comparable to the orbital time is needed to achieve fragmentation, for disk masses in the range 0. 08 - 0. 1 M_. After about 30 orbital times, merging between the bound condensations always leads to 2 - 3 protoplanets on quite eccentric orbits.

40|$|From time to {{time the}} {{industries}} present an interest on reducing the pollution generated by its processes, searching for alternatives which provide equal or better efficiency in its activities. A very promising alternative {{for the application of}} processes which need <b>heating</b> <b>by</b> <b>radiation</b> in related to the porous radiant burners (SCHEFFLER, COLOMBO, 2004; CATAPAN, 2007). The radiant burners should be porous and consist of a ceramic to resist at high temperatures (> 1500 °C) and to provide high resistance to thermal shock. In this work, the replication method was used to obtain alumina foams. Polyurethane foams were impregnated with aqueous suspensions of 50 - 70 % wt. solid (Al 2 O 3) and additives (binders). The viscosity of the suspension was evaluated and adjusted to an appropriate impregnation. The impregnated foams were heat treated for degradation of polyurethane at 400 °C/ 1 h and subsequently sintered (between 1500 °C and 1600 °C/ 3 h) for densification of the cell walls. Permeability and compressive strength of the foams were correlated to the microstructure and cellular morphology (size and geometry of the cells). The sintering temperature, which promoted greater densification and increase in mechanical strength, was 1600 °C...|$|E

50|$|There {{are four}} avenues of heat loss: convection, conduction, radiation, and evaporation. If skin {{temperature}} {{is greater than}} that of the surroundings, the body can lose <b>heat</b> <b>by</b> <b>radiation</b> and conduction. But, if the temperature of the surroundings is {{greater than that of}} the skin, the body actually gains <b>heat</b> <b>by</b> <b>radiation</b> and conduction. In such conditions, the only means by which the body can rid itself of <b>heat</b> is <b>by</b> evaporation. So, when the surrounding temperature is higher than the skin temperature, anything that prevents adequate evaporation will cause the internal body temperature to rise. During sports activities, evaporation becomes the main avenue of heat loss. Humidity affects thermoregulation by limiting sweat evaporation and thus heat loss.|$|R

40|$|The {{conditions}} {{inside and}} downstream of a conversion front, propagating against the air flow, {{have been investigated}} in a fixed bed of biofuel. The aim {{of the work is}} to describe temperatures and gas concentrations in the bed and to obtain data with high accuracy and with a resolution in space and time that is high enough to be useful for validation of mathematical models. To close mass balances of the main species, (C, H, O, N), O 2, CO, CO 2, N 2, H 2, H 2 O and hydrocarbons were measured, and samples of char and tar were analysed. For gas extraction an oil-cooled probe was used. The experimental rig was developed to achieve well-defined, one-dimensional, conditions. The measurements show the different episodes in the conversion front: initial <b>heating</b> <b>by</b> <b>radiation,</b> drying, release of volatiles, ignition and heat release, production of combustion products, depletion of oxygen followed by gasification reactions.

40|$|Array camera {{images of}} the central 1 parsec of the Galactic Center at eight {{mid-infrared}} wavelengths between 4. 8 and 20. 0 microns with approximately 1 arcsec resolution are used to model the temperature, opacity and bolometric luminosity distributions of the emitting dust in the central parsec, and the extinction {{in the line of}} sight. We use the results to discriminate between two mechanisms for heating the dust: <b>heating</b> <b>by</b> <b>radiation</b> from a "central engine" (possibly a massive black hole associated with Sgr A*), or internal heating by luminous stars embedded in or among the dust clouds. The temperature and opacity distributions are consistent with the presence of self-luminous objects imbedded at prominent the IRS source positions. However, temperatures on the northern ann and east-west bar are highest along the inner flank of those structures surrounding the central cavity, while the dust opacity peaks further out from the central cavity. The warm inner ridge suggests heating by centrally located concentrated luminous sources, including IRS 3 and IRS 7. The of the model results are compared with the distributions of the various stellar populations in the central parsec. There is evidence for physical interaction between the warm emitting dust and luminous stars, including dozens of hot He 1 emission line stars and B[] stars. The combined contributions of embedded stars at the IRS source positions and the luminous stars distributed throughout Sgr A West can account for the temperature enhancements and the luminosity distribution in the central parsec computed by the model...|$|E
40|$|We have {{measured}} mid-infrared (MIR) fluxes of 3 C {{sources on}} images taken with ISOCAM onboard the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). The photometric data were combined with existing photometry at other wavelengths {{to assemble the}} spectral energy distribution (SED) for each galaxy from infrared to radio wavelengths. In addition, we used ISOPHOT spectra to compute average MIR spectra for different types of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). The MIR emission of 53 of our sources shows evidence of dust. We find a clear correlation between the SEDs, emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), {{and the type of}} AGN. Specifically, we find that in broad emission line radio galaxies (BLRGs), the dust emission peaks at 40 microns and PAH bands are weak, whereas emission in comparable narrow line radio galaxies (NLRGs) peaks at a longer wavelength of 1 ̃ 00 microns and the PAH bands are much stronger. Although less pronounced, a similar trend is seen when comparing quasars (QSOs) with high-luminosity NLRGs. We used dust radiative transfer models with a central heating source to describe the SEDs. The difference in the dust emission appears to be the effect of <b>heating</b> <b>by</b> <b>radiation</b> from the central engine. In type 1 AGNs (BLRGs and QSOs), the broad line region (BLR) is directly visible and therefore hot (T> 300 K) dust dominates the emission. In this region, PAHs are destroyed which explains the weak PAH emission. On the other hand, the BLR is hidden in type 2 AGNs (NLRGs). Their SEDs are therefore dominated by cooler dust including PAHs.

40|$|Information is now {{available}} regarding the vertical distribution of water vapour and helium in the lower stratosphere over southern England. The helium content of the air {{is found to be}} remarkably constant up to 20 km but the water content is found to fall very rapidly just above the tropopause, and in the lowest I km of the stratosphere the humidity mixing ratio falls through a ratio of 10 - 1. The helium distribution is not compatible with the view of a quiescent stratosphere free from turbulence or vertical motions. The water-vapour distribution is incompatible with a turbulent stratosphere unless some dynamic process maintains the dryness of the stratosphere. In view of the large wind shear which is normally found just above the tropopause it is unlikely that this region is free from turbulence. The observed distributions {{can be explained by the}} existence of a circulation in which air enters the stratosphere at the equator, where it is dried by condensation, travels in the stratosphere to temperate and polar regions, and sinks into the troposphere. The sinking, however, will warm the air unless it is being cooled by radiation and the idea of a stratosphere in radiative equilibrium must be abandoned. The cooling rate must lie between about 0. 1 and I. I"C per day but a value near o. g°C per day seems most probablc. At the equator the ascending air must be subject to <b>heating</b> <b>by</b> <b>radiation.</b> The circulation is quite reasonable on energy considerations. It is consistent with the existence of lower temperatures in the equatorial stratosphere than in polar and temperate regions, and if the flow can carry ozone from the equator to the poles then it gives a reasonable explanation of the high ozone values observed at high latitudes. The dynamic consequences of the circulation are not considered. It should however be noted that there is considerable difficulty to account for the smallness of the westerly winds in the stratosphere, as the rotation of the earth should convert the slow poleward movement into strong westerly winds.

40|$|The {{brain is}} {{sensitive}} to small changes in temperature. Temperature increases may affect enzyme function, leading to possible negative biological effects. Living tissues are dielectric materials, which are subjected to dielectric <b>heating</b> <b>by</b> <b>radiation.</b> A common source of radiation is the cell phone. People often hold cell phones next to their ears, which may exacerbate the effects of radiation, and therein, temperature change. The rate at which tissue absorbs heat from radiation is called the specific absorption rate (SAR). Through observations of SAR values, the thermal effect of the electromagnetic wave heating of superficial tissue within the brain can be quantified. The goal of this project is to model heating of tissue layers in the brain due to cell phone radiation exposure in order to evaluate implications of cell phone usage on brain function. Cranial temperature profiles were studied with varying cell phone distances from the ear, usage durations, and radiation intensities. Cell phone radiation in a model head was simulated in COMSOL Multiphysics 4. 3 b using governing equations for electromagnetic waves and temperature. Maxwell’s equation for electromagnetic waves {{was used to determine}} the electric field and the SAR that would determine heat generation terms. The three-dimensional heat equation was then used to determine the increase in temperature within the brain after a specific period of time. Three dimensions were necessary since there is no symmetry within the head {{in the presence of a}} cell phone. To accurately simulate thermoregulatory processes in the head, metabolic heat generation from these tissues and convective blood flow were included in the heat equation. Values for thermal conductivity, skull dimensions, metabolic heat generation, emissivity, radiofrequency, and power dissipation rate were found in relevant literature. In addition, we compared increases in temperature in the brain model with values found in literature to give us an approximation. The results indicate that after two hours of cell phone usage, the maximum increase in brain temperature was slightly greater than 0. 2 °C in an adult. These results show that there is a minimal effect on cranial temperature by cell phone radiation, even after a significant amount of cell phone usage. The head’s thermoregulatory processes of insulating layers and convective blood flow seem to successfully maintain brain temperature within 0. 2 °C. Thus, brain function is not severely impacted by the thermal effect of cell phone radiation. However, this model may help develop more accurate guidelines for appropriate cell phone usage...|$|E
