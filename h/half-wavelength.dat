[...] It is true, however, that several common antennae are easily matched to cables with these nominal impedances. [...] A quarter wavelength monopole in free space has an impedance of 36.5Ω, and a half wavelength dipole in free space has an impedance of 72Ω. [...] A <b>half-wavelength</b> folded dipole, commonly seen on television antennae, on the other hand, has a 288Ω impedance [...] four times that of a straight-line dipole.

500|$|An {{example of}} such a design is shown in figure 10a. The {{resonators}} are disc flexural resonators similar to those shown in figure 6, except that these are energised from an edge, leading to vibration in the fundamental flexural mode with a node in the centre, whereas the figure 6 design is energised in the centre leading to vibration in the second flexural mode at resonance. The resonators are mechanically attached to the housing by pivots at right angles to the coupling wires. The pivots are to ensure free turning of the resonator and minimise losses. The resonators are treated as lumped elements; however, the coupling wires are made exactly one <b>half-wavelength</b> (λ/2) long and are equivalent to a λ/2 open circuit stub in the electrical equivalent circuit. For a narrow-band filter, a stub of this sort has the approximate equivalent circuit of a parallel shunt tuned circuit as shown in figure 10b. Consequently, the connecting wires are being used in this design to add additional resonators into the circuit and will have a better response than one with just the lumped resonators and short couplings. [...] For even higher frequencies, microelectromechanical methods can be used as described below.|$|E

The Bohr model for a short time could be seen as a classical model with an additional constraint provided by the 'wavelength' argument. However, this period was immediately superseded by the full three-dimensional wave mechanics of 1926. In our current understanding of physics, the Bohr model is called a semi-classical model because of its quantization of angular momentum, not primarily because of its relationship with electron wavelength, which appeared in hindsight a dozen years after the Bohr model was proposed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} form of dipole is two {{straight}} rods or wires oriented end to end on the same axis, with the feedline connected to the two adjacent ends, but dipoles may be fed anywhere along their length. [...] This is the simplest type of antenna from a theoretical point of view. [...] Dipoles are resonant antennas, meaning that the elements serve as resonators, with standing waves of radio current flowing back and forth between their ends. [...] So the length of the dipole elements is determined by the wavelength of the radio waves used. [...] The {{most common form}} is the half-wave dipole, in which each of the two rod elements is approximately 1/4 wavelength long, so the whole antenna is a <b>half-wavelength</b> long. [...] The radiation pattern of a vertical dipole is omnidirectional; it radiates equal power in all azimuthal directions perpendicular to the axis of the antenna. [...] For a half-wave dipole the radiation is maximum, 2.15 dBi perpendicular to the antenna axis, falling monotonically with elevation angle to zero on the axis, off the ends of the antenna.|$|E

High-gain omnidirectional antennas are generally realized using collinear dipole arrays. These consist of multiple half-wave dipoles mounted collinearly (in a line), fed in phase. The coaxial collinear (COCO) antenna uses transposed coaxial sections to produce in-phase <b>half-wavelength</b> radiators.

The light passed through the supporting glass sheet into a very thin and nearly transparent photographic emulsion containing submicroscopically small silver halide grains. A temporary mirror of liquid mercury in intimate contact reflected the light back through the emulsion, creating standing waves whose nodes had little effect while their antinodes created a latent image.

50|$|In hollow metal waveguides {{and optical}} waveguides {{there are an}} {{unlimited}} number of other transverse modes that can occur.

There is always a longitudinal component of one field or the other. The exact mode is identified by a pair of indices counting the number of wavelengths or <b>half-wavelengths</b> along specified transverse dimensions (for instance TE10).

40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation work is to examine light localization in semiconductors provided by a complete photonic bandgap via three-dimensional (3 D) woodpile photonic crystals. A 3 D photonic crystal is a periodic nanostructure that demonstrates omni-directional Bragg reflection. These materials are anticipated to become {{a powerful tool for}} engineering light propagation and localization within subwavelength scales due to their complete photonic bandgap and the distinctive dispersion relation. The approach of realizing microcavities in this dissertation is to combine multi-directional etching fabrication methods with mode gap design. Modulation of unit cell size along a line-defect 3 D waveguide could bring a guiding mode into the mode gap region of the waveguide and form a microcavity with a resonance inside the complete photonic bandgap. The designed microcavities could be fabricated by multi-directional etching methods because they can structurally be decomposed into two sets of connected and straight dielectric rods. Ultra-high-quality factor microcavities and sub-wavelength-scale waveguides are designed without introduction of local disorders. Monopole, dipole, and quadrupole resonant modes are demonstrated with a small modal volume. The smallest modal volumes obtained are 0. 36 cubic <b>half-wavelengths</b> for a resonance field in vacuum, and 2. 88 cubic <b>half-wavelengths</b> for a resonance field in a dielectric. Direct metal contacts with the microcavities do not significantly deteriorate the quality factors because the resonant fields are located inside the microcavities. Single-mode woodpile waveguides are also designed in both lateral and vertical propagation directions. The multi-directional etching method is a simple approach to the fabrication of woodpile photonic crystals and designed optical components with a variety of crystal orientations and surfaces, including (110), (001), (100), and (010) planes. An arbitrary surface plane (mn 0) is obtained with this method, where m and n are integers. Moreover, it can also produce large area woodpile photonic crystals with high precision in silicon and GaAs materials. These optical components in woodpile photonic crystals would be building blocks of high-density, low-loss 3 D integrated optics, cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), nonlinear optics, and enable the realization of current-injection optical devices.

Further improvements in the Q are achieved through tailoring of the defect geometry in Fourier space to limit coupling between the dominant momentum components of a given defect mode and those momentum components which are either not reflected by the PC mirror or which lie within the radiation cone of the cladding surrounding the PC slab.

50|$|Most {{resonant}} cavities {{are made}} from closed (or short-circuited) sections of waveguide or high-permittivity dielectric material (see dielectric resonator). Electric and magnetic energy is stored in the cavity and the only losses are due to finite conductivity of cavity walls and dielectric losses of material filling the cavity. Every cavity has numerous resonant frequencies that correspond to electromagnetic field modes satisfying necessary boundary conditions {{on the walls of}} the cavity. Because of these boundary conditions that must be satisfied at resonance (tangential electric fields must be zero at cavity walls), it follows that cavity length must be an integer multiple of <b>half-wavelength</b> at resonance. Hence, a resonant cavity can be thought of as a waveguide equivalent of short circuited <b>half-wavelength</b> transmission line resonator.
