But many applications on Windows interpret a slash {{for other purposes}} or treat it as an <b>invalid</b> <b>character,</b> and thus require you to enter backslash — notably the cmd.exe shell (often called the [...] "terminal" [...] as it typically runs in a terminal window). Note that many other shells available for Windows, such as tcsh and Windows PowerShell, allow the slash.|$|E

5000|$|Below {{are some}} {{examples}} of operations with buffer gaps. The gap {{is represented by the}} empty space between the square brackets. This representation is a bit misleading: in a typical implementation, the endpoints of the gap are tracked using pointers or array indices, and the contents of the gap are ignored; this allows, for example, deletions to be done by adjusting a pointer without changing the text in the buffer. It is a common programming practice to use a semi-open interval for the gap pointers, i.e. the start-of-gap points to the <b>invalid</b> <b>character</b> following the last character in the first buffer, and the end-of-gap points to the first valid character in the second buffer (or equivalently, the pointers are considered to point [...] "between" [...] characters).|$|E

This happens because the random seed value that is used to initialize the encryption algorithm and is included as part of the encrypted value is different for each encryption operation. Because of this, it is impossible to use data that has been encrypted with the CBC mode as a unique key to identify a row in a database.|$|R

For example, an email intended for the user-entered email address foo+bar@example.com could be incorrectly sent to foobar@example.com. In other cases a poor user experience can occur if some parts of a site, such as a user registration page, allow the [...] "+" [...] character whilst other parts, such as a page for unsubscribing from a site's mailing list, do not.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Input {{validation}} {{refers to}} checking user inputs {{to a program}} {{to ensure that they}} conform to expectations of the program. Input validation is used to check the format of numbers and strings, check the length of strings, and to ensure that strings do not contain <b>invalid</b> <b>characters.</b> Input validation testing (IVT) is particularly important for software that has a heavy reliance on user inputs, including Web applications. A common technique in Web applications is to perform input validation on the client by using HTML attributes and scripting languages such as JavaScript. An insidious problem with performing input validation on the client is that end users have the ability to bypass this validation. Bypass testing is a unique and novel way to create test cases that is available only because of the unusual mix of client-server, HTML GUI, and JavaScript technologies that are used in Web applications. This workshop paper presents the issues and concerns that allow bypass testing, the preliminary concepts behind the technique, and some early results on applying it. How effective and useful bypass testing can be in testing Web applications will be determined through ongoing research and automation...|$|R

50|$|These {{versions}} of MLX shared a format consisting of six data bytes in decimal format, plus a seventh byte {{which served as}} a checksum. Although each line began with the memory address, and bytes were separated with commas, these {{did not have to}} be typed; the program auto-incremented the address and automatically printed the comma delimiters every three <b>characters.</b> <b>Invalid</b> keystrokes were filtered out. When a line was completely typed, it was automatically verified against the checksum value. If it matched, the user would be prompted for the next line. If not, a warning buzzer would sound and the invalid input would be discarded so that the user could retype the line. Several keyboard keys were redefined to create a makeshift numeric keypad.|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of the avian brain is of crucial importance to studies of the transition from non-avian dinosaurs to modern birds, but very few avian fossils provide information on brain morphological development during the Mesozoic. An isolated specimen from the Cenomanian of Melovatka in Russia was described by Kurochkin and others as a fossilized brain, designated the holotype of Cerebavis cenomanica Kurochkin and Saveliev and tentatively referred to Enantiornithes. We have previously highlighted that this specimen is an incomplete skull, rendering the diagnostic <b>characters</b> <b>invalid</b> and Cerebavis cenomanica a nomen dubium. We provide here a revised diagnosis of Cerebavis cenomanica based on osteological characters, and a reconstruction of the endocranial morphology (= brain shape) based on μCT investigation of the braincase. Absence of temporal fenestrae indicates an ornithurine affinity for Cerebavis. The brain of this taxon was clearly closer to that of modern birds than to Archaeopteryx and does not represent a divergent evolutionary pathway as originally concluded by Kurochkin and others. No telencephalic wulst is present, suggesting that this advanced avian neurological feature was not recognizably developed 93 million years ago...|$|R

40|$|A man's {{intelligence}} is not measured {{by how many}} mistakes he makes, but {{how many of those}} mistakes he finds. – Erik de Bie Errors? "I never get errors! " Warnings? "I never bother to read them, my program still runs. " Notes? "Who needs them? " This paper, is {{based on the belief that}} debugging your programs is not only necessary, but also a good way to gain insight into how SAS works. Once you understand why you got an error a warning or a note, you'll be better able to avoid problems in the future. In other words, people who are good debuggers are good programmers. We cover common problems including missing semicolons, <b>invalid</b> data, truncated <b>character</b> values, missing-data-was-generated messages, character to numeric conversions, and the tricky problem of a DATA step that runs without suspicious messages but nonetheless produces the wrong results. For each problem we decipher the message, explain possible causes, and explain how to fix the problem. We also cover some programming strategies to avoid errors in the first place. WHAT IS A BUG? Scientists have identified approximately 1 1 / 4 million species of animals. Of those about 3 / 4, or 932, 000, are insects. However, only the 82, 000 species belonging to the order Hemiptera are considered by scientists to be “true bugs”(McGavin, 1993). Fortunately, a taxonomy of SAS bugs would not identify nearly so many species. Entomology aside, a bug is an error in a computer program that causes an undesired, and usually unexpected, result. One way of classifying computer bugs is to divide them into three types of errors: syntax, data, and logic. Syntax errors result from failing to follow SAS’s rules about the way keywords are put together to make statements. With data errors you have a program that is syntactically sound but fails because the data values do not fit the program as it was written. With logic errors you have a program that runs, and data that fits, but the result is wrong because the program gave the wrong instructions to the computer. The bugs discussed in this paper can be classified as...|$|R
