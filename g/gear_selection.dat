5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} one hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the starting order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry weather conditions. Michael Schumacher achieved his sixth pole position of the season, his second at Monza, with a time of 1:23.770. Although he was happy with his car and tyres, he said that he did not make the best of session because of making a mistake at the first chicane during his first run. Michael Schumacher was joined on the front row by Barrichello who recorded a lap time 0.027 seconds slower and was happy to start alongside his teammate. Häkkinen qualified third, though he believed he could have set a faster time as he struggled with the handling on his car and his McLaren misfired on his final two timed laps. Villeneuve qualified fourth, nearly half a second behind Michael Schumacher, and stated that he was happy with his performance. Häkkinen's teammate Coulthard qualified fifth and was disappointed with his starting position because he encountered traffic during the session and was blocked by Frentzen. Trulli and Frentzen set the sixth and eighth fastest times respectively for Jordan; Trulli reported no problems while Frentzen was impeded by de la Rosa. Ralf Schumacher recorded the seventh quickest time and was disappointed in his performance. De la Rosa completed the top ten fastest qualifiers. His teammate Verstappen qualified eleventh having been forced to use two of his team's cars when they developed hydraulic and engine problems. Button qualified twelfth and said he overheated his tyres after running insufficient amounts of downforce. Wurz, who qualified in 13th, used the session to familiarise himself with Benetton's spare car. He was ahead of Irvine in the faster of the two Jaguar's, who set a best time that was one-tenth of a second faster than his own teammate Johnny Herbert in 18th; both were disadvantaged at the lack of straightline speed. Salo was 15th quickest for the Sauber team, ahead of his own teammate Diniz whose car handled badly under braking. The pair were marginally quicker than Zonta who encountered <b>gear</b> <b>selection</b> problems in his race car, and switched to his team's spare monocoque. The grid was completed by Alesi and Nick Heidfeld in the Prost's who qualified in front of the Minardi's of Marc Gené and Gastón Mazzacane.|$|E
25|$|As {{a general}} rule, fixed-gear {{bicycles}} are single-speed. A derailleur for <b>gear</b> <b>selection</b> would introduce chain slack, which {{would interfere with}} braking. <b>Gear</b> <b>selection</b> can, however, be accomplished {{with the use of}} an internally geared hub. For example, a Sturmey-Archer fixed-gear 3-speed hub is a fixed-gear multi-speed arrangement. Most fixed-gear bicycles only have a front brake, and some have no brakes at all.|$|E
25|$|The Hayabusa's {{abundance}} of power at any engine speed made the Hayabusa easier to ride {{by giving the}} rider a greater choice of <b>gear</b> <b>selection</b> for a given speed and stunning acceleration.|$|E
5000|$|... 4WD, which {{featured}} four-wheel-drive, a 15 mm higher ride height and added <b>gear</b> <b>selections</b> for the transmission ...|$|R
50|$|All {{configurations}} of the Rhino use a constantly variable transmission (CVT) design with a subtransmission assembly providing two forward <b>gear</b> <b>selections</b> (high and low range), a reverse gear, and a neutral position. Yamaha's unique CVT design differed from most other CVT designs {{at the time}} in that the Ultramatic separated the clutch and drive functions from each other. This design allows the Rhino (and all Yamaha Ultramatic ATVs) to eliminate the problem of belt failure due to excessive slipping.|$|R
5000|$|Frazer Nash {{were strong}} proponents {{of this system}} using one chain per gear {{selected}} by dog clutches. The Frazer Nash chain drive system, (designed for the GN Cyclecar Company by Archibald Frazer-Nash and Henry Ronald Godfrey) was very effective, allowing extremely fast <b>gear</b> <b>selections.</b> The Frazer Nash (or GN) transmission system {{provided the basis for}} many [...] "special" [...] racing cars of the 1920s and 1930s, the most famous being Basil Davenport's Spider which held the outright record at the Shelsley Walsh Speed Hill Climb in the 1920s.|$|R
25|$|The C6 {{generation}} did {{not match}} the previous generation's relatively good fuel economy, despite its relatively low 0.28 drag coefficient and low curb weight, achieving 16/26 mpg (city/highway) equipped with automatic or manual transmissions; like all manual transmission Corvettes since 1989, it is fitted with Computer Aided <b>Gear</b> <b>Selection</b> (CAGS) to improve fuel economy by requiring drivers to shift from 1st gear directly to 4th in low-speed/low-throttle conditions. This feature helps the C6 avoid the Gas Guzzler Tax by achieving better fuel economy.|$|E
25|$|Different {{gears and}} ranges of gears are {{appropriate}} for different people and styles of cycling. Multi-speed bicycles allow <b>gear</b> <b>selection</b> to suit the circumstances: a cyclist could use a high gear when cycling downhill, a medium gear when cycling on a flat road, and a low gear when cycling uphill. In a lower gear every turn of the pedals leads to fewer rotations of the rear wheel. This allows the energy required to move the same distance to be distributed over more pedal turns, reducing fatigue when riding uphill, with a heavy load, or against strong winds. A higher gear allows a cyclist to make fewer pedal turns to maintain a given speed, but with more effort per turn of the pedals.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes {{turbo lag}} is mistaken for engine speeds that are below boost {{threshold}}. If engine speed is below a turbocharger's boost threshold rpm then {{the time needed}} for the vehicle to build speed and rpm could be considerable, maybe even tens of seconds for a heavy vehicle starting at low vehicle speed in a high gear. This wait for vehicle speed increase is not turbo lag, it is improper <b>gear</b> <b>selection</b> for boost demand. Once the vehicle reaches sufficient speed to provide the required rpm to reach boost threshold, {{there will be a}} far shorter delay while the turbo itself builds rotational energy and transitions to positive boost, only this last part of the delay in achieving positive boost is the turbo lag.|$|E
40|$|Abstract- This paper {{presents}} {{design and}} analysis of torque and flux density in perpendicular magnetic gear with different magnetic materials, dimensions and air gap. The results were compared to each other. This type of gear offers both high gear ratio and high torque. Moreover the low speed side is connected to prime mover and high speed side is connected to load after analysis, which is suitable for wind power, industrial (Group Drives) applications etc. Finally, it is concluded that the result in this paper may help to initiate a shift from mechanical gears to magnetic <b>gears.</b> (<b>Selection</b> of magnetic <b>gear</b> for suitable applications) ...|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} racing arcade games from the 80s such as Pole Position and Out Run only offered a {{two-speed}} manual transmission option without an automatic transmission {{option for the}} player; some later arcade games such as Turbo Outrun started to offer an option for two-speed manual or automatic transmission selection by the player.Later on, arcade games such as Hard Drivin' and its Race Drivin' sequel, along with Daytona USA started offering at least four <b>gear</b> <b>selections</b> including on the manual transmission shifter used by the player.Some racing arcade games require the player to use a clutch pedal during gear changes when a vehicle with manual transmission is selected such as in Hard Drivin' and its Race Drivin' sequel, along with Ridge Racer Full Scale.|$|R
25|$|Gear sets may be {{replaced}} with closer ratios to keep the engine in the power band, or, on some cars that produce enough power and torque to four-gear transmissions {{similar to the ones}} used in NASCAR (such as the Andrews four-speed dog box that Vaughn Gittin Jr. ran in his 2016 Mustang) with more open-ratio gears, this limits the number of shifts the driver has to do during their run. These may be coarser dog engagement straight cut gears instead of synchronised helical gears, for durability and faster shifting at the expense of noise and refinement. Wealthier drifters may use sequential gearboxes to make <b>gear</b> <b>selection</b> easier and faster, while sequential shift lever adapters {{can be used to make}} shifts easier without increasing shift time.|$|E
25|$|At the start, Alesi got {{ahead of}} both Barrichello and Lehto with Coulthard {{getting ahead of}} Barrichello as well. Schumacher led Hill, Häkkinen, Alesi, Lehto and Coulthard into lap 2. Schumacher pulled away until he began to have <b>gear</b> <b>selection</b> {{problems}} and was stuck in fifth gear. During the stops, Schumacher amazingly was able to pull away without stalling. Behind, there was action in the pits as Coulthard stalled and Alesi had troubles, dropping down four places. Schumacher, still in the lead, was struggling and was passed by Hill. During {{the second round of}} pit stops, Barrichello spun off near the pit entry and Schumacher was once again able to make a pitstop and not stall the car. Häkkinen was right with him but did not have a chance to attack as his engine failed on lap 49. Lehto took up third, but his engine failed as well five laps later. Brundle took the place, but his transmission failed spectacularly with six laps to go. Hill won from Schumacher who was a superb second in the circumstances, Blundell, Alesi, Pierluigi Martini and Irvine.|$|E
500|$|... 1959 {{brought a}} new option, the Rush-Matic {{automatic}} transmission, which featured two modes: Rush (fully automatic) and Road (manual <b>gear</b> <b>selection).</b> The same year, assembly of the Vedette started at Simca do Brasil. Also during 1959, a new top-of-the-line model joined the Vedette range, the Présidence, featuring a luxurious interior, a radiotelephone (a European first) and a continental kit. French coachbuilder Chapron built two 2-door Présidence convertibles for a governor {{of one of the}} French colonies. Chapron had another order the next year, to build two four-door convertibles for the French President Charles de Gaulle. The Beaulieu was dropped in autumn 1960, but the other models remained unchanged until the 1961 model year, when they received new seats, new chrome decor, and the engine was fitted with a new anti-vibration crankshaft.|$|E

2500|$|In 2010, the GT California Special was re-introduced as {{optional}} on the Mustang GT. Black GTCS side stripes which {{faded into}} a side scoop. The front fascia {{was replaced with}} the one used in the 2011 Boss 302 with working lower fascia fog lights. The rear diffuser {{was taken from the}} Shelby GT 500 while the rear deck lid featured black vinyl and a wing spoiler. Wheels were argent spoke 19inch with a GT logo stamped towards the outer rim on each wheel. The interior's bright dash was replaced with black carbon fiber treatment, while carbon fiber door inserts and seat leather patterns were added. Badging included [...] "GTCS" [...] on the carbon fiber dash and floor mats. The front Grill was brushed aluminum billet with a V6 style pony emblem on the driver's side. (for 2012, it was changed to black billet). Rear axle <b>gear</b> <b>selections</b> were 3.31, 3.55, or 3.73.|$|R
50|$|The VF {{uses the}} same engines as the VE, with minor {{alterations}} to improve performance and fuel efficiency, while the automatic gearbox was redesigned to give more appropriate <b>gear</b> <b>selections.</b> The VE's E85 compatibility was not carried forward to the VF V8 engines, but remained in the V6 engine until it was dropped in the VFII. Fuel economy has also been improved {{by the use of}} aluminium body panels and components, leading to the VF being 43 kg lighter than the VE, and the electric power steering system. The new styling has also improved the aerodynamic efficiency, with the coefficient of drag dropping from 0.33 to 0.30. As a result, fuel consumption has dropped by between three and eight percent depending on the engine and specification level. Starting with the VF II 2015, the 6.0-litre L77 was replaced by the 6.2-litre LS3. The VF II model also saw the discontinuation of the LPG versions of the Commodore.|$|R
500|$|After {{the crash}} {{between himself and}} Burti on the first lap, Michael Schumacher said that {{although}} he saw Burti in his rear-view mirrors, {{he did not know}} which line he wanted to take and he could not take avoiding action because of his <b>gear</b> <b>selection</b> problem. Burti said that the accident [...] "looked worse on TV" [...] and that he stated his spin on lap 18 was caused because his left arm was aching from the crash. Coulthard questioned the decision to stop the race by saying: [...] "Accidents or injury off the track is not normally a reason to stop the race. There's lots of races that would have benefited from being red-flagged to give people a show." [...] He also said he felt consistency was needed but accepted that the organisers had the final say on stopping a race. Villeneuve also agreed with Coulthard's view. A spokesman for the FIA confirmed and defended the red-flag decision and they said it was shown to prevent a larger accident. Michelin Motorsport Director Pierre Dupasquier agreed with the FIA's view and stated he was concerned about cars hitting the strands of debris and catching a puncture.|$|E
500|$|The weather {{conditions}} on the grid were dry before the race; the air temperature was [...] and the track temperature [...] The race started at 14:00 local time. A total of approximately 100,000 spectators attended the race. As the drivers were preparing to start the formation lap, both Minardis were in the pit lane due to technical difficulties. Both Alonso and Marques initially started from the pit lane. Both Williams drivers maintained first and second positions going into the first corner. Further back, Michael Schumacher slowed with an issue with his <b>gear</b> <b>selection,</b> which resulted in drivers being forced to swerve to avoid him. Burti was unable to view the Ferrari as Panis was blocking his view and hit the rear of Schumacher's car, launching Burti {{into the air and}} he rolled over the top on Bernoldi's vehicle's and narrowly landed on Verstappen's Arrows. Burti's car lost one of its wheels, landing of Bernoldi's Arrows which resulted in a broken engine cover and rear wing for the Brazilian. Burti's car bounced across the gravel trap and came to a rest on the Nordkurve corner tyre barriers. The race was red-flagged as strands of carbon fibre were scattered across the track and marshals were needed to clear the debris.|$|E
2500|$|The Azera has a four-wheel {{independent}} suspension (multi-link in the rear) {{and uses the}} company's new 3.8L Lambda V6, which produces 265hp (196kW).

50|$|This {{allows the}} {{installation}} of a cog (or freewheel) {{on one side of}} the hub, and another (cog or freewheel) on the other side of the same hub. Reversing the rear wheel allows switching between Fixed/Free drivetrain, between two different size gears, or both. Generally, the freewheel is selected to be the same size, or slightly larger (more teeth) than the fixed cog. Same size allows the same gearing, but with coasting option, while a slightly larger freewheel gear allows coasting and easier pedaling for longer or hilly rides. Both could also be freewheels for two different coasting <b>gear</b> <b>selections.</b> Any two different size cogs/freewheels can be used as long as they are within the limits of adjustibility allowed by the length of the frame's dropout slots, derailleur cage and chain length. Large differences in the number of teeth may require adding or subtracting chain links to achieve proper fit. Also, if rear brakes are used (recommended for fixed/free, or free/free setups) brake pad reach to the rear rim may need to be adjusted.|$|R

2500|$|With {{production}} of the Z8 completed by November 2002, for 2003 the Z8 production {{was replaced by the}} Alpina V8 Roadster. The Alpina was a departure from the hard-edged sporting focus of the original car, and elements of the new grand touring intent were evident throughout this final edition. Instead of the original six-speed manual and 4.9L (S62) engine featured in earlier Z8's, the Alpina came only as an automatic, using a five-speed BMW Steptronic transmission mated to a downgraded 4.8L Alpina-tuned V8 motor from the Alpina E39 B10 V8 S (M62). In order to complete the car's transition from sports car to boulevardier, relaxed suspension tuning was used. The standard Z8's run-flat tires on [...] wheels were discarded in favor of conventional tires with softer sidewalls, on [...] wheels. A new, softer grade of Nappa leather replaced the Z8's less supple specification, and special Alpina gauges were featured on the dash cluster. An Alpina steering wheel with three solid spokes replaced the original, which could not be retrofitted with shift paddles for the automatic. <b>Gear</b> <b>selection</b> was displayed in an Alpina-specific display mounted in front of the wheel.|$|E

50|$|Manual {{transmissions}} use {{a mechanical}} clutch to transmit torque, {{rather than a}} torque converter, thus avoiding {{the primary source of}} loss in an automatic transmission.
