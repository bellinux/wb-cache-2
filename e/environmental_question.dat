It began in 1976, when OMC was cited by both the U.S. and Illinois environmental protection agencies for polluting a drainage ditch and Waukegan harbor with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The company filed suit against both agencies after lengthy negotiations, charging that the federal government had dragged its feet in spending funds authorized for pollution-control use. Company attorneys also stated that the PCB-contaminated pipes had been replaced in 1976, but the agencies likewise filed suit, asking that the company be ordered to remove the contaminants from the harbor, and to pay a maximum penalty of about $20 million, reflecting a $10,000 fine for each day the PCB sources had been in place. This suit was to dog OMC's footsteps throughout the 1980s.|$|E

We thereby try to avoid the pitfall of a voluntaristic or substantively normative approach to what repoliticisation can mean. By pointing to the subtle polemic on a metalevel which lurks beneath even the most consensual discourse, a potential starting point for repoliticisation is uncovered, which also enables a political re-reading of the ‘post-ecologist turn’. Finally, we argue that the same characteristics that make the <b>environmental</b> <b>question</b> liable to depoliticisation, can also turn it into a field of politicisation par excellence. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of constructions of reality in visual and textual {{representations}} in current exhibitions in the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm with comparisons to the Natural History Museum in Gothenburg and minor excursions to other museums. The study also includes seven giant screen films in Cosmonova: an IMAX theatre {{which is part of}} the Swedish Museum of Natural History. The study consists of three parts: I. Historical and theoretical contextualisation: The emergence of museums is understood as an aspect of modernity and nature, and analytical concepts from semiotics, deconstruction and discourse analysis are presented and discussed. This part also includes a discussion of anthropomorphism and andropocentric stereotyping and a study of the emergence of the <b>environmental</b> <b>question</b> in society, science, museums and in the disciplines of sociology and cultural studies. II. Empirical analysis: Starting with questions what stories modern exhibitions in museums of natural history tell and how animals, bodies, humans and the environment are represented in the exhibitions and films I discuss different aspects of the dualism of nature and culture in relation to other dualisms such as animal/human, nature/society and ecology/economy. The dualism nature/culture that is expressed in exclusions of conventional signs for human culture is problematic from an environmental perspective. I pose the question of whether or not the marginalized phenomenon of the cabinet of curiosity that combine both “naturalia” and “artificialia” and displays phenomena classified as abnormal, can provide a key to narratives about co-evolution, environmental issues and variations in morphology and behaviour. III. Discussion: The potential for transcending the dualism of nature and culture, both theoretically-and practically-speaking, and particularly in relation to the <b>environmental</b> <b>question,</b> is discussed, as is the possibility that museums can be(come) reflexive sub-political arenas for dialogues between politics, science and people...|$|E

The third part relates this argument to the views of political theorists who argue that the political constitution of western democracies is increasingly marked by the consolidation of post-political and post-democratic arrangements. Fourth, I discuss the climate change consensus in light of the post-political thesis. I conclude that the matter of the environment and climate change in particular, needs to be displaced onto the terrain of the properly political...|$|E

While animals also cause damage to the environment out of existential needs like grazing and loosening soil, few living things have gone beyond Nature’s capacity to heal and rebalance itself, and none has damaged Nature in the gratuitous manner of human acts of needless and pointless extravagance.
