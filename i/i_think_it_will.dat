5|$|Gouverneur Morris is credited, {{both now}} and then, {{as the chief}} {{draftsman}} of the final document, including the stirring preamble. Not all the delegates were pleased with the results; thirteen left before the ceremony, and three of those remaining refused to sign: Edmund Randolph of Virginia, George Mason of Virginia, and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts. George Mason demanded a Bill of Rights if he was to support the Constitution. The Bill of Rights {{was not included in}} the Constitution submitted to the states for ratification, but many states ratified the Constitution with the understanding that a bill of rights would soon follow. Shortly before the document was to be signed, Gorham proposed to lower the size of congressional districts from 40,000 to 30,000 citizens. A similar measure had been proposed earlier, and failed by one vote. George Washington spoke up here, making his only substantive contribution to the text of the Constitution in supporting this move. The Convention adopted it without further debate. Gorham would sign the document, although he had openly doubted whether the United States would remain a single, unified nation for more than 150 years. Ultimately, 39 of the original 55 delegates ended up signing, but it is likely that none were completely satisfied. Their views were summed up by Benjamin Franklin, who said, I confess that There are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them.... I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain, may be able to make a better Constitution.... It therefore astonishes me, Sir, to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> astonish our enemies...|$|E

25|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be a {{very long}} time. But I would say this. Will the time ever come when we can say Hitler's shadow is gone? I think, yes, it will come when Israel is {{accepted}} in peace with its neighbor states. But it doesn't look like it will happen soon.|$|E

25|$|I do {{not mean}} to say that Mr. Ainsworth, when writing this novel, did not {{introduce}} some of his own ideas; but as the first idea and all the principal points and characters emanated from me, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be allowed that the title of originator of The Miser's Daughter should be conferred upon, Sir, Your obedient servant, George Cruikshank.|$|E

I think it may be one of the biggest stories in Hollyoaks history. It's very, very serious and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> really divide the audience. It will really test them and their {{relationship}} to the nth degree, and we'll see whether they can recover from it." ...|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Rowson has {{speculated that}} [...] "in {{principle}} {{it should be}} possible for a machine to ... develop 32-piece tablebases. This may take decades or even centuries, but unless runaway global warming or nuclear war gets in the way, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> eventually happen."

[...] In a 1996 statistical study, T.V. Buttrey found that about 750,000,000 of the circulation quarters, more than a third, had been hoarded and did not circulate. [...] Coin dealer Marcel Sassola suggested in 1977 of the silver sets, [...] "There were just too many sold, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> {{take a long time}} before they have any real value.

500|$|Arriving first {{during the}} summer was English defender Matthew Upson from Luton Town. French midfielders Emmanuel Petit and Gilles Grimandi joined from Monaco, where they were protégées to Wenger. Marc Overmars, a midfielder from Ajax, was {{recruited}} in a £7million deal and spoke of his delight at joining Arsenal in his press conference: [...] "I like English football because there is more space. With my speed and quality <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be good for me here." [...] Deals for midfielders Luís Boa Morte and Alberto Méndez striker Christopher Wreh and goalkeeper Alex Manninger were also finalised before August.|$|E
500|$|After {{witnessing}} early mechanical {{television in}} action, Commissioner Lafount {{said that the}} FRC was doing all it could to help develop the still-infant technology in terms of regulatory issues. He wrote in 1931 that, [...] "I believe that television is destined to become the greatest force in the world. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> have more influence over the lives of individuals {{than any other single}} force." [...] This remark has been quoted in several books about the history of television. [...] He at the same time proposed the censorship of television, in order that objectionable images not be seen and the amount of advertising not be excessive.|$|E

500|$|Rachel Matt Thorn, the English {{translator}} of the manga, {{wrote that}} fans of Anne of Green Gables or The Rose of Versailles would also enjoy Wandering Son, and Silverman compared Wandering Son to Mizuiro Jidai. Thorn described the art as [...] "clean and lovely" [...] {{and went on}} to cite Wandering Son as [...] "sweet, thought-provoking, funny, and moving, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> resonate with readers regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation." [...] The first manga volume as translated by Fantagraphics Books had an early debut at the May 2011 Toronto Comic Arts Festival and sold out within the first two hours of the event.|$|E
500|$|Founded in 2003 {{as part of}} a {{government}} project for 11- to 19-year-olds, Partington and Carrington Youth Partnership (PCYP) has since expanded its scope and provides facilities for youths up to the age of 25. It runs a 5-a-side football league and Screamin' Wheels Skate Park. In 2009 it was announced that a £5million youth centre would be built in the town. Based on designs by pupils from Broadoak Secondary School, the centre will provide facilities for workshops in dance, film-making, and art. Headmaster of the school, Andy Griffin, said [...] "It's a massive thing for Partington as this will help kick-start regeneration of the town. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> also help bring people to Partington rather than leaving".|$|E
500|$|Geoffrey of Gaimar, an Anglo-Norman chronicler, also {{recounts the}} battle: [...] "after that reigned Edward's son Athelstan. When he had reigned {{to the fourth}} year, he waged a battle against the Danes; and he {{defeated}} Guthfrith the king. After that he assembled a great army and into the sea issued a great fleet. Directly to Scotland he went; he harried that country well. One year later, no less no more, at Brunanburh he had the upper hand over the Scots, and over the men of Cumberland, over the Welsh, and over the Picts. There were so many slain <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be told forever. Afterwards he lived only three years; he had no son, no other children. His brother was then made king." ...|$|E

Appearances included Ready Steady Cook, Blue Peter, the BBC News Channel, Sky News Sunrise, The Alan Titchmarsh Show and The Paul O'Grady Show. Speaking about the album's promotion, Smith said [...] "t is always a struggle when a second album comes out because you never know how it is going to do but fingers crossed people will enjoy it. I am very proud of it. ... I am excited about going on all the shows too – especially Ready Steady Cook because I can't cook and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Overmars {{signed for}} Arsenal in June 1997. The fee was {{reported}} to be between £5million and £7million, with the player on a five-year contract, paid £18,000 per week. Overmars relished the challenge of playing in England: [...] "I like English football because there is more pace. With my speed and quality <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be good for me here." [...] Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger believed Overmars had his [...] "best years ahead of him" [...] and met his criteria of a player [...] "used to the pressures of playing for a big club and everything that goes with it". He opined that Arsenal lost the Premier League at home the previous season – [...] "we were maybe the best away team," [...] and commented on their inability to play expansive football. Wenger felt the signing of Overmars would rectify that problem.|$|E
500|$|Wolters did {{not attend}} the Nuremberg trial (he later {{described}} it as a [...] "victor's court" [...] and as a [...] "show trial") but wrote to Speer in January 1946, during the trial: [...] "I stand by you in misfortune as in the good days. [...] I believe as before in your lucky star." [...] On August 10, as the trial approached its conclusion, Speer, anticipating the likelihood of a death sentence, wrote to Wolters asking him to [...] "collect my work together for later ages and to recount much of my life. [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be honored one day." [...] Despite his forebodings, Speer did not receive the death sentence, but on October 1, 1946, was given a sentence of twenty years in prison, [...] and on July 18, 1947, was transferred to Spandau Prison to serve it.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{featured}} the song [...] "Montana" [...] by Youth Lagoon {{during the final}} scene. Many viewers wondered if the series creator had changed the ending for the last episode, due to the cancellation of the series. This caused series creator and executive producer Killen to assure viewers that the episode would have been [...] "exactly the same" [...] {{if it had been}} renewed for a second season. In a pre-broadcast interview by Entertainment Weekly with Killen and actor Jason Isaacs, Isaacs claimed that he found it [...] "strangely ironic and amusing" [...] to be promoting the series finale of the Awake series. Killen claimed that [...] "When we wrote the episode, we didn't know it {{would be the end of}} the series". He stated that it had a [...] "satisfying conclusion", [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be a satisfying way to leave the show".|$|E
500|$|One of the {{illustrations}} did not coordinate properly with Potter's text. She altered the drawing and wrote Warne, [...] "I {{have altered the}} oven as it will save a good many corrections. I did a good deal to the cat but she is still looking at the top one. I don't think it signifies as she talks about both ovens ... I don't think I have ever seriously considered {{the state of the}} pie but the book runs some risk of being over cooked if it goes on much longer! I am sorry about the little dog's nose. I saw it was too sharp. I think I have got it right. I was intending to explain the ovens by saying the middle handle is very stiff so that Duchess concludes it is a sham;–like the lowest. I think only two pages want changing; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> come right." ...|$|E
500|$|Natalie Portman as Queen Padmé Amidala, the 14-year-old Queen of Naboo, {{who hopes}} to protect her planet from a {{blockade}} invasion made by the Trade Federation. Over 200 actresses auditioned for the role. The Production notes stated; [...] "The role required {{a young woman who}} could be believable as the ruler of that planet, {{but at the same time}} be vulnerable and open". Portman was chosen especially for her performances in [...] (1994) and Beautiful Girls (1996), which impressed Lucas. He stated, [...] "I was looking for someone who was young, strong, along the lines of Leia [...] Natalie embodied all those traits and more". Portman was unfamiliar with Star Wars before being cast, but was enthusiastic about being cast as a character she expected to become a role model. Portman said, [...] "It was wonderful playing a young queen with so much power. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be good for young women to see a strong woman of action who is also smart and a leader." ...|$|E
