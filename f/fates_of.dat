5|$|The book {{is divided}} into 27 chapters, with a prelude, coda, {{bibliography}} and index. Each chapter deals with a new topic, such as the potential <b>fates</b> <b>of</b> plastics, petroleum infrastructure, nuclear facilities, and artworks.

There is no unifying narrative, cohesive single-chapter overview, or thesis.|$|E

Friendly tribes taught newcomers how to grow indigenous crops, prepare foods, and hunt wild game.

The <b>fates</b> <b>of</b> 331 of the escapees are unknown. A common punishment for escape attempts was death by starvation; the families of successful escapees were sometimes arrested and interned in Auschwitz and prominently displayed to deter others. If someone did manage to escape, the SS picked ten people at random from the prisoner's block and starved them to death.|$|E

The fight, so near {{what they find}} to be the Crystal, the source of life, summons Necron, a force of annihilation. Its defeat destroys the Tree; the party flees, while Zidane stays behind to rescue Kuja. In the epilogue one year later, the <b>fates</b> <b>of</b> all of the characters are shown, and Zidane reappears in Alexandria to see Queen Garnet.|$|E

The fate of the family is representative of the <b>fates</b> <b>of</b> many of the minor aristocracy in France, especially those in the military and diplomatic corps, whose reputations the Montagnards tarnished in the Reign of Terror.|$|E

The faces of actors were digitally mapped onto three-dimensional character models to preserve realism. Cyan paid attention to making the game more accessible to new players {{by the addition of}} multiple methods of navigation and an in-game camera.

The episodes ends with a description of the <b>fates</b> <b>of</b> each of the characters involved in the episode.|$|E
5|$|Bowen was {{prompted}} {{to write the}} story of the relocated wolves after becoming outraged over the continued poaching of wolves in the protected areas of Ninemile Valley. She spent four years researching wolves while working on the novel. In recounting the <b>fates</b> <b>of</b> the animals at the end, she expresses hope in the ideals behind efforts to restore wolf populations. Nominated for a 2006 Teens' Top Ten award by the American Library Association, the novel was praised by critics. Two praised Bowen's ability to avoid anthropomorphism while capturing the essence of wolf behavior and life. Another also praised the story's highlighting of the difficulties in wolf relocation programs.|$|E

As a result, none of the first four boats was ever launched or completed {{before the end of}} the war. U-107 was 35% complete at war's end, while U-108 was only 30% complete, respectively. Ganz Danubius had also begun stockpiling materials for U-109 and U-110 but had not started on these two boats. Although there is no specific mention of the <b>fates</b> <b>of</b> the pair of incomplete boats of the U-107 class, incomplete boats from other late-war classes were scrapped 1919–1920.|$|E
5|$|The {{boats were}} begun {{late in the}} war when {{shortages}} of skilled shipyard workers and materials were slowing construction of other boats under construction. As a result, none {{of the first three}} boats was ever launched, much less completed, and the rest were cancelled before any were laid down. U-101 was 47% complete at war's end, while U-102 and U-103 were only 30% and 10% complete, respectively. Although there is no specific mention of the <b>fates</b> <b>of</b> the three incomplete boats of the U-101 class, incomplete boats from other late-war classes were scrapped in 1919 and 1920.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} glorifies {{this event}} in Poland's past and its culture, and {{the majesty of}} its kings. At the same time, the painting has darker undertones, reflecting the troubled times that befell Poland {{in the late eighteenth}} century, for the Kingdom of Prussia would become one of the partitioning powers that ended the independence of Poland. The painting was seen by some as anti-Prussian, foretelling its perceived betrayal of Poland; others have noted it is also critical of Poland, as Matejko included signs that signify this seemingly triumphant moment was a hollow, wasted victory. Matejko created his painting to remind others {{about the history of the}} no-longer-independent country he loved, and about the changing <b>fates</b> <b>of</b> history. The painting is counted among his masterpieces.|$|E
40|$|As astronomers further {{develop an}} {{understanding}} <b>of</b> the <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> the Universe, {{it is essential to}} study students’ ideas on the <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> the Universe so that instructors can communicate the field’s current status more effectively. In this study, we examine undergraduate students’ preinstruction ideas <b>of</b> the <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> the Universe in ten semester-long introductory astronomy course sections (ASTRO 101) at three institutions. We also examine students’ postinstruction ideas about the <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> the Universe in ASTRO 101 over five semester-long course sections at one institution. The data include precourse surveys given {{during the first week of}} instruction (N= 264), postinstruction exam questions (N= 59), and interviews. We find that, preinstruction, more than a quarter of ASTRO 101 students either do not respond or respond with “I don’t know” when asked what the long-term <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> the Universe is. We also find that, though the term was not necessarily used, students tend to describe a “big chill” scenario in the preinstruction surveys, among a wide variety of other scenarios. A fraction of students describe the <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> smaller-scale systems, possibly due to confusion of the hierarchical nature of structure in the Universe. Preinstruction, students mention the Universe’s expansion when describing how astronomers know the <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> the Universe but do not discuss how we know the Universe is expanding or the relationship between expansion and the <b>fate</b> <b>of</b> the Universe. Postinstruction, students’ responses shift toward greater degrees of completeness and correctness...|$|R

5|$|Dean's {{plan was}} to airlift one {{battalion}} of the 24th Infantry Division into South Korea via C-54 Skymaster transport aircraft and to block advancing North Korean forces while {{the remainder of the}} division was transported on ships. The 21st Infantry Regiment was identified as the most combat-ready of the 24th Infantry Division's three regiments, and the 21st Infantry's 1st Battalion was selected because its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles B. Smith, was the most experienced, having commanded a battalion at the Battle of Guadalcanal during World War II. On July 5, Task Force Smith engaged North Korean forces at the Battle of Osan, delaying 5,000 North Korean infantry for seven hours before being defeated. The 540-man force suffered 60 killed, 21 wounded and 82 captured, a very heavy casualty rate. In the chaos of the retreat, most of the bodies were left behind, and the <b>fates</b> <b>of</b> many of the missing were unknown for several weeks.|$|E
5|$|Jimenez stopped {{feeding the}} pups after Thanksgiving that same year. Though the pups learned to hunt, Silver and Pikuni left {{the pack and}} the other four began killing livestock. They were {{captured}} to be relocated, much as their parents had been. One, Camas, escaped after waking up from the tranquilizer early. Chinook was killed for continuing to hunt livestock and Timber {{was killed by a}} poacher. Tenino, who also continued hunting livestock, was recaptured and sent to Wolf Haven International, a sanctuary in Washington State, where he lived until his death in 2001. The <b>fates</b> <b>of</b> the other cubs, as well as Rann, the cub who escaped the initial relocation, are unknown. In the epilogue of the novel, Bowen expresses hope that they survived and bred, enabling the bloodlines started with Marta and Greatfoot to continue in the wolf packs that now inhabit the area. Jimenez continued working as the Wyoming Wolf Recovery Project Leader for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service until 2008, when he was selected to be the Wyoming Game and Fish Department's Wolf Program Coordinator.|$|E

Sanne Ledermann, often mentioned in Anne's diary, had been gassed along with her parents; her sister, Barbara, a close friend of Margot's, had survived.
