25|$|Flue-cured Virginia tobacco {{became the}} favoured crop of many European {{planters}} in the Shire Highlands {{in the second}} decade of the 20th century. The areas farmed rose from 4,507 acres in 1911 to 10,489 acres in 1913 and 14,218 acres in 1920, yielding an average tobacco crop of 407 pounds an acre. Before 1920, only about 5% of the crop marketed was dark-fired tobacco produced by African farmers, but this rose to about 1 million pounds or 14% by 1923. The First World War boosted the production of European-farmed, flue-cured Virginia leaf, but post-war competition from the United States Virginia prompted a rebate one-sixth of import duties to assist Empire growers. Much of the tobacco produced by Nyasaland’s European estates, particularly by smaller growers, was of low-grade and often unsaleable. In 1921, only 1,500 tons of a 3,500 ton crop could be sold immediately: {{the cost of the}} relatively expensive <b>flue-curing</b> process (when overproduction was leading to reduced sale prices) made low-grade tobacco unprofitable, and put the smaller European growers out of business.

For the first two decades of the 20th century, the area remained undeveloped and relatively under-populated. Small amounts of cotton, sisal and tobacco were grown but the tobacco was hit by disease, the value of sisal was low and the cool weather was unsuitable for cotton. With {{the construction of the}} Shire Highlands Railway from Port Herald to Blantyre, which opened in 1908, the estates began to grow Flue-cured tobacco, and The British Central Africa Company Ltd was able to interest the Imperial Tobacco Company in Nyasaland tobacco. The company imported good quality seed and brought in experts, at first aiming to produce cigar leaf, but later concentrating on flue-cured leaf for cigarettes. By 1907, the British Central Africa Company had 14 barns for <b>flue-curing</b> tobacco, {{out of a total of}} 119 such barns in the protectorate. At the end of the First World War, the company started a scheme for settling ex-servicemen on its undeveloped land as tobacco growers. About 50 men took up farms, usually of 1,000 acres. Many failed in the period from 1920 to 1924, as none had a farming background or any farming training. Some survived until a drastic fall in prices for flue-cured tobacco after 1927, but then took up whatever employment they could find. After 1927, the production of dark-fired tobacco by African farmers, either estate tenants or on Crown lands, overtook that of flue-cured tobacco, and the British Central Africa Company, which already had a scheme for its tenants to grow tobacco under supervision, became mostly a broker for the tobacco those tenants produced.|$|E

The authors found that flue-cured tobacco producers made greater adjustments to their operations after the buyout than did burley tobacco producers.

As a result of increased acreage, tobacco operations became more sensitive to changes in labor costs. With over 75 percent of tobacco farms using hired or contract labor in 2008, the availability and cost of workers have become increasingly important to tobacco producers. This report is based on data collected from the tobacco version of the 2008 Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS), which focused on U.

40|$|Tobacco {{is known}} to contain a class of nitrosamines known as tobacco-specific nitrosamines or TSNA. Nitrosation of {{naturally}} occurring tobacco alkaloids is commonly accepted as the mechanism of TSNA formation in tobacco. Because green and freshly harvested tobaccos are virtually free of TSNA, formation and accumulation of TSNA are generally considered to occur during the curing process. Most recent hypotheses have focused on microbial reduction of nitrate to nitrite and other oxides of nitrogen (NOcompounds) that react with tobacco alkaloids to form TSNA during curing. This natural microbial process remains the prevalent hypothesis for TSNA formation in burley and other air-cured tobaccos. However, a different mechanism {{for the formation of}} TSNA in flue-cured tobacco, independent of microbial activity, is documented in this paper. It is common practice to <b>flue-cure</b> Virginia or blonde tobacco in bulk barns that incorporate forced air ventilation and temperature control. For the last thirty-five years, many modern bulk barns in North America generally have used liquid propane gas (LPG) with direct-fired burners that exhaust combustion gases directly into the barn where the tobacco is exposed to those gases. Our studies indicate that LPG combustion by-products in the exhaust stream, namely NO, react with naturally occurring tobacco alkaloids to form TSNA. Heat exchange curing methods preclude exposure of the tobacco to combustion gases and by-products, thereby eliminating this significant source of TSNA formation, without degrading leaf quality or smoking character. Research findings from 1998 and 1999 are presented to demonstrate the role of NOgases in TSNA formation and the significance of direct-fired curing as a primary source of TSNA formation in flue-cured tobacco. Also, data from an extensive barn conversion program in 2000, which resulted in a 94 % average reduction in TSNA levels in cured flue-cured leaf, are presented...|$|R

Since 1947, the Indian government has supported growth in the tobacco industry.

The government has set up Tobacco Board, Guntur which works to increase exports of Indian tobacco. Guntur is also well known place for tobacco plantation. The Central Tobacco Research Institute works {{under the aegis of}} Indian Council of Agricultural Research. Tobacco crop is cultivated in an area of 0.45 M ha (0.27% of the net cultivated area) producing ~ 750 M kg of tobacco leaf. India is the 2nd largest producer and exporter (in quantity terms) after China and Brazil, respectively. The production of <b>Flue-Cured</b> Virginia (FCV) tobacco is about 300 million kg from an area of 0.20 M ha while 450 M kg non-FCV tobacco is produced from an area of 0.25 M ha. In the global scenario, Indian tobacco accounts for 10% of the area and 9% of the total production. By virtue of the dominant role played by this commercial crop, the Indian Central Tobacco Committee (ICTC) established Central Tobacco Research Institute (CTRI) in Rajahmundry (Andhra Pradesh) in 1947. The Institute was under the administrative control of ICTC, Madras from 1947 to 1965 and subsequently transferred to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), New Delhi. ICAR acts as a repository of information and provides consultancy on agriculture, horticulture, resource management, animal sciences, agricultural engineering, fisheries, agricultural extension, agricultural education, home science, and agricultural communication.

The rate of ethylene evolution from {{the leaves of the}} fast yellowing cultivars was significantly higher than in the slow yellowing ones. The same differences were obtained with shoots of intact seedlings. The findings suggest {{that it is possible to}} use ethylene production by seedlings as a selection criterion in screening for genotypic {{differences in the}} rate of yellowing. The ability of carbon dioxide (1 %) to enhance ethylene production by attached leaves was significant in a slow, but not in a fast yellowing cultivar. However, similar amounts of ethylene were produced on administration of 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid to a slow and a fast yellowing cultivar. Exposure of attached leaves to exogenous ethylene (0. 1 microliter per liter) accelerated the loss of chlorophyll and protein. This treatment was effective only for slightly yellow leaves and not for fully expanded green ones.
