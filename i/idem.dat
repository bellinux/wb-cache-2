5|$|Another fountain, {{sometimes}} {{also known}} as the Wignacourt Fountain, was built close to Porta Reale in Valletta attached to the Ferreria building (demolished). It consists of a lion's head pouring out water into a stone basin, topped by the coat of arms of Wignacourt and the Order and surrounded by a garland of flowers and interlocking seashells. Below the coats of arms is a radiating sun with the inscription Omnibus <b>Idem</b> (meaning the same to all), indicating that the water was freely available to everyone.|$|E
5|$|Godwin had {{a lifelong}} {{interest}} {{in language and}} communication (as is evident in Gonsales's various means of communicating with his servant Diego on St Helena), {{and this was the}} topic of his Nuncius inanimatus (1629). The language Gonsales encounters on the Moon bears no relation to any he is familiar with, and it takes him months to acquire sufficient fluency to communicate properly with the inhabitants. While its vocabulary appears limited, its possibilities for meaning are multiplied since the meaning of words and phrases also depends on tone. Invented languages were an important element of earlier fantastical accounts such as Thomas More's Utopia, François Rabelais's Gargantua and Pantagruel and Joseph Hall's Mundus Alter et <b>Idem,</b> all books that Godwin was familiar with. P. Cornelius, in a study of invented languages in imaginary travel accounts from the 17th and 18th centuries, proposes that a perfect, rationally organised language is indicative of the Enlightenment's rationalism. As H. Neville Davies argues, Godwin's imaginary language is more perfect than for instance More's in one aspect: it is spoken on the entire Moon and has not suffered from the Earthly dispersion of languages caused by the fall of the Tower of Babel.|$|E

25|$|In October 2007, on the {{congress}} {{meeting of the}} International Canoe Federation in Guatemala City the organization rights of the World Championships were given to Vichy, beating the bids of Athens and Szeged. The regatta course in Vichy is on a natural river, which quality is highly influenced by the weather conditions. On the 2010 World Cup events a heavy water flow was experienced on the Allier River making the racing unequal. A number of competitors, including Olympic medalists Josefa <b>Idem</b> and Ken Wallace expressed their concerns and dissatisfaction with the track, following that the International Canoe Federation had to reconsider its decision. In early July, after a deep analysis of the situation, being aware of the possible inequity and unfairness on a major Olympic qualification event, the French Canoe Federation {{with the consent of}} the International Canoe Federation desisted from organizing the event. On 25 July 2010 the Executive Committee of the International Canoe Federation awarded the vacant place in its meeting in Lausanne to Szeged, which came second behind Vichy in the official candidating process, and was originally scheduled to host of the 2013 ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships.|$|E
25|$|Dragana Mirković {{remains the}} biggest turbo-folk {{star in the}} country, with her {{numerous}} hits (Sama, Plači zemljo, Pitaju me u mom kraju, Poslednje veče, Ne vraćam se starim ljubavima, Nisam ni metar od tebe). With her pink hair and very recognizable screen persona, Zorica Brunclik (Kada bi me pitali, Košava, Otkopčano jeleče, Ja znam, A tebe nema) could be considered Dragana's follow-up. Vesna Zmijanac, the previous wife of Zorica's husband, has preserved the fame she had in 80s with hit-songs like Jorgovani, Ja imam nekog a ti si sam, Malo po malo, Kunem ti se životom, <b>Idem</b> preko zemlje Srbije. Among the others, there are Halid Bešlić (Miljacka, Prvi poljubac, Put me zove), Ana Bekuta (Oluja, Imam jedan život, Kralj ponoći, Zlatiborske zore), Sinan Sakić (Ej, otkad sam se rodio, Delija momak, Prvi poljubac), Stojanka Novaković Stoja (Moje srce ostariti ne sme, Žena starija, Samo) and Nedeljko Bajić Baja (Ginem, ginem, Mini suknja, Zapisano u vremenu). The absolute record in sales {{of this kind of}} music is still held by Lepa Brena, who has sold around 40 million records and held concerts all over the Balkans. Next to that, due to her enormous popularity, Brena is considered the symbol of former Yugoslavia, of Yugoslav unity and power, and after the break of federation, of so-called Yugo-nostalgia.|$|E
25|$|History of responsa in Judaism spans {{a period}} of 1,700 years. Rabbinic responsa {{constitute}} a special class of rabbinic literature, differing in form, but not necessarily in content, from Rabbinic commentaries devoted to the exegesis of the Bible, the Mishnah, the Talmud, and halakha (the codes of Jewish religious law). The codes themselves contain the rules for ordinary incidents of life. The responsa literature covers all these topics and more.Jewish Encyclopedia bibliography: Responsal literature {{as a whole has}} as yet found no literary historian; single periods have been discussed while others have been entirely neglected, the works on these separate epochs including: Joel Müller, Briefe und Responsen aus der Vorgaonäischen Jüdischen Literatur, Berlin, 1886; <b>idem,</b> Einleitung in die Responsen der Babylonischen Geonen. ib. 1891; Zecharias Frankel, Entwurf einer Geschichte der Literatur der Nachtalmudischen Responsen, Breslau, 1865. The responsa by European and American rabbis to problems arising in America are summarized by J. D. Eisenstein, The Development of Jewish Casuistic Literature in America, Baltimore, 1905. The mode, style and subject matter have changed {{as a function of the}} travels of the Jewish people and of the development of other halakhic literature, particularly the codes. Forumulation of responsa, or she'elot ve-t'shuvot, which literally translates to questions and answers, generally involve an individual or group asking either teachers, rabbis, or heads of yeshivot about halakhah (Jewish law) and the party responding via an exchange of letters. Responsa literature spans 1700 years and there are even responsa being developed based on questions posed today. The development of responsa literature can be divided into four periods: the Tannaitic Period, the Geonic Period, the First Rabbinic Epoch,the Second Rabbinic Epoch, the Third Rabbinic Epoch, and the Fourth Rabbinic Epoch.|$|E
