He said“I think there were a few things that went wrong; I underestimated the ISL.

25|$|Page and Plant {{would come}} back from the Welsh {{mountains}} with the guitar intro and verse. I literally heard it in front of a roaring fire in a country manor house! <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> bass recorder and played a run-down riff which gave us an intro, then I moved into a piano for the next section, dubbing on the guitars.|$|E

2500|$|Within {{a week of}} his wedding, Wedge {{had been}} {{committed}} to the psychiatric ward in the Highland Hospital in Oakland, California for observation after admitting to an alienist {{that he had been}} obsessed with either strangling his new wife or defenestrating her during their honeymoon. Wedge also confessed that [...] "for several months I have been fighting a desire to kill myself. For weeks I would want to slash my throat every time <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> razor. Every time I looked out of a high window I wanted to jump out. I am a sick man and for my own protection and for the protection of my loved ones I want to be locked up and be placed where I can harm neither myself or anyone else". Wedge believed his condition was caused by damage caused by a frontal skull fracture sustained in a saloon fight about 1899, and exacerbated by the stress caused by the publicity surrounding his wedding and resignation from the church.|$|E
60|$|As I spoke <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> fancy silver knife {{that lay}} on the table. It had a rough {{resemblance}} to a pocket pistol, and gave me the idea of palming it off as such.|$|E

60|$|As I spoke <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> {{dead tree}} branch that lay by the bench, and hurled {{it with all}} my force into a close {{congregation}} of the sparrows on the grass.

60|$|It is true <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> third guinea {{a little}} after, where it lay shining {{on a piece}} of turf.

6000|$|Birds {{are very}} rare, as is all animal life but insects, {{and a small}} fresh-water crab, Thelphusa, ("Ti-hi" [...] of the Lepchas).
