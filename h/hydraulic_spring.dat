40|$|This master’s thesis {{consists}} of designing and modelling a damper {{system for a}} Wärtsilä Steerable Thruster. Aim is to reduce torque peaks caused by ice impacts on the propeller shaft of the thruster. A passive ideal damper {{as well as a}} novel hydraulic-mechanical damper are modelled and the effects of the damper are simulated in varied ice impact scenarios. Simulated ice impact cases are generated to be similar to the ones of Det Norske Veritas regulations. In addition further custom ice impacts with variable sinusoidal impact lengths are generated. Simulations are conducted without a damper, with a passive ideal damper and with the novel hydraulic-mechanical damper. A validated simulation model of the WST- 14 propulsion system is given for use in this master’s thesis by Tampere University of Technology Laboratory of Automation and Hydraulics. Novel hydraulic-mechanical damper is a rotating dual-mass torsional damper.

Most signiﬁcant results of the hydraulic-mechanical damper are torque peak reduction of 8. 6 % in the propeller shaft and maximum peak-to-peak reduction of over 40 %.

Here we explore methods that could be applied to model site-specific hydraulic responses, with the intent of simulating these responses to different climate scenarios from high-resolution climate models. We compare <b>hydraulic</b> responses (<b>spring</b> flow, groundwater level, and stream base flow) at several sites in two karst aquifers: the Edwards aquifer (Texas, USA) and the Madison aquifer (South Dakota, USA). A one-dimensional, lumped-parameter model simulates nonstationary soil moisture changes for estimation of recharge, and a nonstationary convolution model simulates the aquifer response to this recharge. Model fit to data was 4 % better for calibration periods than for validation periods. We use metrics that describe the shapes of the impulse-response functions (IRFs) obtained from convolution modeling to make comparisons in the distribution of response times among sites and among aquifers. Combined principal component analysis and cluster analysis of metrics describing the shapes of the IRFs separated those sites with IRFs having a large ratio of the mean response time to the system memory from those with large skewness and kurtosis. Classification of the IRF metrics indicate that there is a range of IRF characteristics for different site types (i. e., spring flow, groundwater level, base flow) within a karst system. Further, similar site types did not necessarily display similar IRFs. Results indicate that the differences existing within either aquifer are larger than {{the differences between the two}} aquifers and that the two aquifers are similar according to this classification. The use of multiple metrics to describe the IRFs provides a novel way to characterize and compare the way in which multiple sites respond to recharge.

Examples are the devices under development at the University of Uppsala, Sweden, and Oregon State University, USA, prototypes of which were recently tested.

This cable also prevents the buoy from drifting away by providing a horizontal restoring force. The horizontal and (to a lesser extent) the vertical restoring forces are nonlinear functions of the horizontal and vertical displacements of the buoy, which makes the system a nonlinear one (even if the spring and damper are linear), whose modelling requires a time-domain analysis. Such an analysis is presented, preceded, for comparison purposes, by a simpler frequency-domain approach. Numerical results (motions and absorbed power) are shown for a system consisting of a hemispherical buoy in regular and irregular waves and a tight mooring cable.

A lumped-parameter model simulates nonlinear soil moisture changes for estimation of recharge, and a time-variant convolution model simulates the aquifer response to this recharge. Model fit to data is 2. 4 % better for calibration periods than for validation periods according to the Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency, which ranges from 0. 53 to 0. 94 for validation periods. We use metrics that describe the shapes of the impulse-response functions (IRFs) obtained from convolution modeling to make comparisons in the distribution of response times among sites and between aquifers. Time-variant IRFs were applied to 62 % of the sites. Principal component analysis (PCA) of metrics describing the shapes of the IRFs indicates three principal components that together account for 84 % of the variability in IRF shape: the first is related to IRF skewness and temporal spread and accounts for 51 % of the variability; the second and third largely are related to time-variant properties and together account for 33 % of the variability. Sites with IRFs that dominantly comprise exponential curves are separated geographically from those dominantly comprising lognormal curves in both aquifers as a result of spatial heterogeneity.

40|$|Understanding of {{wetlands}} {{is vital for}} conservation management and evaluating the impacts of climate change and groundwater abstraction. The Lambourn Observatory at Boxford comprises a 10 ha SSSI designated water meadow. A layer of up to 2. 7 m of peat covers up to 7. 5 m of coarse-grained gravel alluvium, underlain by Chalk. Previous investigations using an arbitrary piezometer array and chemistry have suggested a northern dependency on river stage and southern dependency on groundwater contributions. However, groundwater inflows to wetlands can be discrete and easily missed. Spatial surveys are necessary to ensure sites are adequately conceptualised. We rapidly characterised the site using temperature and vegetation over 2 weeks. Temperature data were collected in winter at multiple depths down to 0. 9 m at over 1000 locations.

Semi-active resetable devices are fundamentally <b>hydraulic</b> or pneumatic <b>spring</b> elements. They possess the ability to release the stored spring energy at any time.

40|$|This paper details a {{comprehensive}} control {{structure and the}} application in managed pressure drilling (MPD). The goal of this controller is to regulate the downhole pressure and rate of penetration (ROP) at desired values and attenuate any unwanted gas influx. For this purpose, a moving horizon estimator (MHE), an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC) are designed to estimate and regulate the process. MHE and EKF provide the estimated unmeasured variables values to the controller to update the NMPC model and enable the controller to capture varying dynamics of the drilling process. During MPD, the main pump sends the drilling mud {{into the middle of}} the drill string pipe. This mud travels downward through the drill bit and into the annulus and upward to the choke valve. Mud is used to remove the drilling cuttings and also to maintain a hydrostatic pressure at the drill bit against reservoir pore pressure. Rotation speed of the drill string (RPM) and weight on the bit (WOB), the amount of downward force placed on the drill bit, are two of the main factors that affect the drilling rate. Drill string rotation is adjusted with a top drive and WOB is adjusted by actuation above ground.

Principal component {{analysis was used to}} investigate the depth-time distributions of productivity for summers 196 l-l 986. Two characteristic patterns were found, together accounting for 60 - 70 % of the year-to-year variability. The first pattern corresponds to the deep productivity maximum that forms in the hypolimnion in June and July. Variability in this first pattern arises from the direct effects on phytoplankton populations of year-to-year changes in timing of ice breakup and <b>hydraulic</b> flushing in <b>spring.</b> The first pattern is unusually strong or weak, compared to the long-term average, during the phenomenon of El Niiio-Southern Oscillation. A second characteristic pattern corresponds to the mixed-layer productivity maximum that develops in August and Sep-tember. Variability in this second pattern arises from trophic interactions at higher levels: rainbow trout feed on late-summer Daphnia rosea populations, which in turn graze on the mixed-layer algal community. In addition, some of the variability in the rainbow trout population arises from year-to-year differences in angling pressure from humans. These results demonstrate how interannual variability in an ecosystem property (primary productivity) can be controlled by forces acting simultaneously through the top and the base of the food web. Phytoplankton biomass and productivity in lakes vary at many time scales: millenia and longer (Horie 198 1), centuries (Hutch-inson et al. 1970), decades (Edmondson 1972; Goldman 1988), and year to year (Scavia et al. 1986; Goldman et al. 1989), as well as at shorter scales (Sommer et al...|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic servoactuators {{have long}} been used in {{industry}} where high performance precision motion control is required. Because of their precision and ability to generate large forces, applications are numerous in industry. One such application provides cockpit motion for flight simulation. This thesis investigates a new emergency shutdown (abort) scheme for such high performance servo-systems. Because flight simulation involves the motion control of both man and machinery (a mock cockpit in motion), {{it will be used}} as the standard by which a safe and effective abort is modeled. The justification for motion abort during actuator operation is unsafe actuator accelerations. In order to protect man and equipment, the operation of critical servosystems, such as flight simulators, must be constantly monitored to detect system malfunctions which might cause personal injury or equipment damage. After any malfunction is detected, the appropriate shutdowm hardware must be signaled to safely take command of the servosystem and bring it to rest. The intent of this thesis was to verify the integrity of a new concept in hydraulic actuator abort, which utilizes the mechanical feedback of actuator acceleration. Once verified, critical design parameters can be further optimized and possible design configurations suggested. The abort system was modeled on a software package called Continuous System Modelling Program (CSMP). The actual abort subsystem proved to work as expected, but when integrated into the flight simulation actuation system, instability was observed. This instability occurred due to extremely large inertial forces acting on relatively large volumes of compressible <b>hydraulic</b> fluid. The <b>spring</b> rate imposed by the hydraulic fluid caused high frequency oscillations, superimposed on the desired steady state behavior, to pass through the entire system.
