The results were compared with those obtained in 10 healthy women (mean age 32. 8 yr, PRL = 7 to 15 ng/ml) and in 8 women with a PRL-secreting pituitary microadenoma (MA) (mean age 37. 5 yr, PRL = 39 to 85 ng/ml).

40|$|AbstractBackgroundPrimary <b>empty</b> <b>sella</b> is a {{herniation}} of the sellar diaphragm {{into the}} pituitary space. It is an incidental finding and patients may manifest neurological, ophthalmological and/or endocrine disorders. Episodes of vertigo, dizziness, and hearing loss, have been reported. ObjectiveTo determine the conditional probability, {{as well as}} the statistical dependency, through the Bayesian analysis in patients with primary <b>empty</b> <b>sella</b> and audiovestibular disorders. PatientsIndividuals who attended the National Rehabilitation Institute from January 2010 to December 2011, diagnosed with primary <b>empty</b> <b>sella</b> and audiovestibular disorders. Material and methodsAn analysis was performed on a sample of 18 patients with a diagnosis of primary <b>empty</b> <b>sella</b> confirmed with magnetic resonance studies and who had signs of vertigo, hearing loss and dizziness. ResultsOf the 18 patients studied, 3 (16. 66 %) had primary <b>empty</b> <b>sella</b> as the only clinical evidence. In 9 patients (50 %) <b>empty</b> <b>sella</b> was associated with vertigo, and 16 patients (88. 88 %) were diagnosed with hearing loss, with sensorineural hearing loss being the most frequent (77. 77 %). The intersection between the proportions of primary <b>empty</b> <b>sella</b> with the presence and type of hearing loss was calculated. Thus for sensorineural hearing loss, the calculated ratio was P(AB) = 0. 6912, and for conductive and mixed hearing loss the value of P(AB) = 0. 0493 in both cases. ConclusionsBayesian analysis and conditional probability enables the dependence between two or more variables to be calculated.

40|$|Purpose: It is {{not clear}} if Hashimoto’s {{thyroiditis}} leads to <b>Empty</b> <b>sella</b> <b>syndrome.</b> In the present study, we aimed to investigate if Hashimoto’s thyroiditis was associated with <b>Empty</b> <b>sella</b> <b>syndrome,</b> and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis was a secondary cause od some cases of primary <b>Empty</b> <b>sella</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Material and Method: Eighty-one patients who were diagnosed with primary <b>Empty</b> <b>sella</b> <b>syndrome</b> {{were included in the}} study.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Empty</b> <b>sella</b> is {{characterized}} by the herniation of the subarachnoid space within the sella, which is often associated with some degree of flattening of the pituitary gland. This study was undertaken to evaluate the clinical and hormonal profile in patients with <b>empty</b> <b>sella.</b> Aims and Objectives: To evaluate the clinical and hormonal profile of the patients with an <b>empty</b> <b>sella.</b> Materials and Methods: Patients undergoing a CT/MRI at our center, for various reasons but with the finding of the <b>empty</b> <b>sella</b> were included in this study. A detailed history and clinical examination was done. Apart from routine tests, hormonal evaluation included serum thyroid stimulating hormone, T 4, cortisol (8 am), prolactin, total testosterone, follicle stimulating hormone, leutinizing hormone, and fasting Insulin like Growth factor 1 (IGF 1) were done. Results: A total of 34 patients, diagnosed radiologically to have <b>empty</b> <b>sella,</b> were evaluated and of them 24 had primary <b>empty</b> <b>sella</b> (PES) and 10 had secondary <b>empty</b> <b>sella</b> (SES). In subjects with PES, 12 out of 24 (50 %) had endocrine dysfunction. The most common endocrine dysfunction noted was hyperprolactinemia, which was seen in 5 (20. 8 %) patients and the most common hormonal deficiency was isolated GH deficiency seen in four patients (12. 5 %). Conclusion: The high incidence of endocrine abnormalities in patients with PES mandates that these patients should routinely be subjected to endocrine evaluation to detect these deficiencies early, and appropriate replacement instituted where necessary, thus ensuring them of a better quality of life...|$|R

Materials and Methods: This ongoing study was carried out in patients attending to endocrine out-patient departments from August 2012 to July 2013. A detailed history and examination was done. Hormonal evaluation including free thyroid hormones, thyroid stimulating hormone, growth hormone (GH), follicular stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, cortisol and prolactin was done.

40|$|Inaccuracy in {{recognizing}} the <b>empty</b> <b>sella</b> by conventional computed tomography (CT) techniques derives from diverse intrasellar cystic structures {{that are not}} distin-guished from it. In 23 cases of presumed <b>empty</b> <b>sella,</b> {{it was observed that}} the pituitary stalk within the enlarged sella (infundibulum) was demonstrated by thin (1. 5 mm) coronal CT sections. Although the diagnosis was not proven by conventional studies, the normal appearance of the infundibulum is believed to exclude an intrasellar cyst or tumor as the cause of sellar enlargement. Coronal CT sections with thin slices and intravenous contrast enhancement are recommended when <b>empty</b> <b>sella</b> is to be docu-mented by CT.

40|$|SUMMARY: A 50 -year-old woman {{presented}} with intermittent headache {{for the past}} few years. A paranasal sinus CT scan showed a diffusely calcified lesion at the roof of the sphenoid sinus and sella turcica, with the sellar floor bony cortex involved. <b>Empty</b> <b>sella</b> was noted. MR imaging revealed a soft-tissue lesion with low signal intensity on T 1 -weighted images, high signal intensity on T 2 -weighted images, and heterogeneous enhancement on postgadolinium images. Histologic examina-tion revealed an osteoma composed of mature lamellar bone. Osteoma is the most common bony tumor affecting thecranial meninges, and most frequently involves fronto-ethmoid areas. 1 Patients withmeningeal osteoma usually have no symptoms except they occasionally complain of neurologic ones relating to a mass effect due to tumor growth. 2 Osteoma in the sphenoid sinus is extremely rare. 3 An <b>empty</b> <b>sella</b> is defined as a sella that, regardless of its size and etiology, is completely or partly filled with CSF. 4 <b>Empty</b> <b>sella</b> associated with tumor is seldom reported. 5 Sphenoid sinus osteoma in the <b>sella</b> associatedwith <b>empty</b> <b>sella,</b> to our knowledge, has no...|$|R

40|$|Longstanding {{hydrocephalus}} {{and raised}} intracranial pressure {{can lead to}} unusual anatomical variants in {{the floor of the}} third ventricle, which may be important when performing endoscopic third ventriculostomy. Two middle aged patients with symptomatic longstanding hydrocephalus had scans that showed ventricular hydrocephalus, an <b>empty</b> <b>sella,</b> and a dilated infundibular recess which herniated into the sella turcica. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy confirmed that instead of the tuber cinerum and infundibular recess, the anterior inferior floor of the third ventricle was hanging down ventral to the pons into the sellar floor. Third ventriculostomy to the prepontine cistern was made on the dorsal wall of the dilated infundibular recess to the area surrounded by the dorsum sellae, the basilar artery trunk, and the left superior cerebellar artery, with good symptomatic control. Association of the <b>empty</b> <b>sella</b> and persistence of the infundibular recess must be carefully evaluated by MRI before attempting endoscopic third ventriculostomy.
