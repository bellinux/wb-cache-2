Sagas have more than once placed their hero <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>famous</b> battle and then embellished it with a series of literary mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|In a later match, against Essex, Miller was {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>famous</b> incident that is frequently cited when his character is discussed; it also spotlighted his differences with Bradman. On {{a day when}} the Australians set a world-record of 721runs in a single day, Miller came to the crease with his side already dominating, with the score 2/364. He deliberately allowed himself to be bowled first ball, much to Bradman's displeasure, in a protest against the one-sided nature of the contest.|$|E

5|$|Goebel {{played a}} role <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>famous</b> Ohio State-Illinois game on November 13, 1943. The game was Paul Brown's last game {{as coach of the}} Buckeyes. With the score tied 26–26, Ohio State threw an {{incomplete}} forward pass into the end zone as the gun sounded. The game appeared to have ended in a tie, the teams left the field, and the stands emptied. However, Ohio State assistant coach Ernie Godfrey had noticed Goebel, who was the head linesman, drop a handkerchief to signal a penalty. On hearing the gun sound, Goebel had picked up the handkerchief and put it back in his back pocket. Godfrey confronted Goebel, who conceded that Illinois was offsides. Twenty minutes later, the teams came back onto the field and the Buckeyes kicked a 33-yard field goal to give Coach Brown a 29–26 win in his final game.|$|E

5|$|The {{governing}} body, the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU), {{was established}} in 1881, {{the same year that}} Wales played their first international against England. Wales' performances in the Home Nations Championship (now the Six Nations) continued to improve, experiencing their first 'golden age' between 1900 and 1911. They first played New Zealand, known as the All Blacks, in 1905, when they defeated them 3–0 <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>famous</b> match at Cardiff Arms Park. Welsh rugby struggled between the two World Wars, but experienced a second 'golden age' between 1969 and 1980 when they won eight Five Nations Championships.|$|E
5|$|During the Second Fronde, between 1650 and 1653, Louis, the Prince of Condé, {{controlled}} much of Paris {{alongside the}} Parlement, while Broussel, through his son, continued {{to control the}} Bastille. In July 1652, {{the battle of the}} Faubourg St Antoine took place just outside the Bastille. Condé had sallied out of Paris to prevent the advance of the royalist forces under the command of Turenne. Condé's forces became trapped against the city walls and the Porte Saint-Antoine, which the Parlement refused to open; he was coming under increasingly heavy fire from the Royalist artillery and the situation looked bleak. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>famous</b> incident, La Grande Mademoiselle, the daughter of Gaston, the Duke of Orléans, convinced her father to issue an order for the Parisian forces to act, before she then entered the Bastille and personally ensured that the commander turned the fortress's cannon on Turenne's army, causing significant casualties and enabling Condé's army's safe withdrawal. Later in 1652, Condé was finally forced to surrender Paris to the royalist forces in October, effectively bringing the Fronde to an end: the Bastille returned to royal control.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, Chappell toured South Africa with Richie Benaud's International Wanderers team, {{released}} his autobiography Chappelli {{and was named}} as one of five Wisden Cricketers of the Year. He was hired to spend the summer of 1976–77 as a guest professional in the Melbourne district competition where he was paid {{more than he had}} been as Australian captain. During the season, he was involved <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>famous</b> altercation with a young English all-rounder who was in Victoria on a cricketing scholarship, Ian Botham. Both men have put forward vastly different versions as to what happened during the physical confrontation in a Melbourne pub. The animosity between them continues and Channel Nine used it as a marketing ploy when Botham temporarily partnered Chappell as a television commentator during the 1998–99 season. Botham again revived the feud in his 2007 autobiography with another version of the incident.|$|E

5|$|In {{the realm}} of modern research, the late British {{biochemist}} and historian of Chinese science Joseph Needham (1900–1995) (known as Li Yuese in China) did extensive research and analysis of Su Song's texts and various achievements in his Science and Civilization in China book series. Joseph Needham also related many detailed passages from Su's contemporary medieval Chinese sources {{on the life of}} Su and his achievements known in his day. In 1956, John Christiansen reconstructed a model of Su Song's clocktower <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>famous</b> drawing, which garnered attention in the West towards 11th-century Chinese engineering. A miniature model of Su Song's clock was reconstructed by John Cambridge and is now on display at the National Science Museum at South Kensington, London. In China, the clocktower was reconstructed to one-fifth its actual scale by Wang Zhenduo, who worked for the Chinese Historical Museum in Beijing in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|On 21 January 2013, Campbell {{signed for}} Cardiff City on a three-and-a-half-year deal {{for a fee}} {{believed}} to be in the region of £650,000. He made his debut on 2 February 2013 against Leeds United, where he scored the only goal of the match in the 64th minute after coming on as a substitute just two minutes before. On 16 February, Campbell scored two goals on his home debut against Bristol City in the Severnside derby, which was then followed by another two against Wolverhampton Wanderers the following week. Campbell was named as the Championship's Player of the Month for February 2013 after scoring all of Cardiff's five goals during the month. On {{the last day of the}} Championship title-winning season, Campbell scored in a 2–2 draw with his former club Hull, taking his final season tally for the Cardiff to seven goals in twelve appearances. In the second match of the 2013–14 season on 25 August 2013, Campbell scored twice <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>famous</b> 3–2 victory at Cardiff against Manchester City, with both goals coming from headers off corner kicks.|$|E
5|$|After the débâcle at Ypres, the bishop's forces divided, some {{going back}} to England, some {{remaining}} with the bishop and others under Sir Thomas Trivet and Sir Hugh Calveley retiring to Bourbourg and Bergues. The bishop and Calveley had wished to advance into France, but Sir William Elmham, Trivet {{and some of the}} other commanders refused to go. The bishop, after entering Picardy for some distance, was obliged to fall back upon Gravelines. It turned out that the French had little stomach for a showdown with the English and their allies, preferring instead to negotiate: part of the French army was unwilling to fight when Despenser and Calveley encountered it when moving towards Picardy. It is possible that had King Richard crossed the Channel with a large English army, the campaign would have ended <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>famous</b> victory. However, for the demoralised and disease-ridden English forces, the arrival of the French headed by the boy-king Charles VI was decisive. Charles had taken the oriflamme on 2 August and his army was mustered in Arras on 15 August. They advanced into Flanders, reaching Thérouanne by the end of August, Drincham on 5 September, Bergues on 7 September (forcing Trivet's and Elmham's retreat to Bourbourg and Gravelines) and Dunkirk on 9 September. Bourbourg was besieged on 12 September: two days later the Duke of Brittany persuaded the French to negotiate a surrender and the English garrison was given safe conduct from the town. The French army then proceeded along the coast and besieged Gravelines. There, without Despenser's authority, the defenders accepted bribes and the bishop's treasurer pocketed 5000 francs. Despenser at first refused the surrender terms, but a few days later Gravelines was evacuated and Despenser ordered it to be sacked. By the end of October the remaining crusaders had returned across the English Channel.|$|E
