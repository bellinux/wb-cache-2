50|$|Diesel exhausts, {{long known}} for their {{characteristic}} smells, changed significantly with the reduction of sulfur content of diesel fuel, and again when catalytic converters were introduced in exhaust systems. Even so, diesel exhausts continue to contain an array of inorganic and organic pollutants, in various classes, and in varying concentrations (see below), <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>fuel</b> composition and engine running conditions.|$|E
50|$|The {{handling}} changed {{according to}} the amount of fuel carried; using the fuselage tank alone, fuel consumption had no appreciable effect on handling because the tank was at the centre of gravity, but with full wing tanks, directional control was compromised, especially in a dive. The flight controls were well harmonized and the aircraft was easy to control at high speed. The maximum dive speed tested was 830 km/h with no buffeting and excellent stability both in the dive (<b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>fuel</b> load) and as a gun platform.|$|E

The type of generators to be deployed will <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>fuel</b> availability onsite. Usually, it takes less than 30  s for the generator to start up to serve critical loads. During the generator start up, energy storage devices can be used to secure critical loads to allow a smooth transition from the grid-connected to islanded-mode operation.|$|R

It is possible to pile large logs in a slash heap mixed with finer and drier fuel components and have most of the fuel components completely consumed. Under natural conditions of a moving flame front, these larger components are seldom consumed. The longer duration of the fire and {{the arrangement of the}} fuel components gives more effective heat transfer and the rate of drying of the larger components is sufficiently rapid for combustion to take place.|$|R
50|$|Multiple {{types of}} solid fuel gasifiers are commercially {{available}} for coal, petcoke, and biomass gasification. Designs vary <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>fuel</b> and intended application. As a result, they can {{differ in the}} composition of the syngas produced and the efficiency with which they convert coal energy content to syngas energy content - a performance parameter typically termed cold gas efficiency. The gasifiers also vary in their main operating parameters - e.g., process temperature, pressure, and demands for oxygen and steam. For power systems based upon the integration of coal gasification and SOFC technologies, these parameters, particularly cold gas efficiency and the oxygen and steam demands, will affect electricity production efficiency.|$|E
50|$|The total {{installed}} utility power generation capacity is nearly 21,000 MW in the state. Only 13,688.80 MW is the committed power {{supply to the}} state.

The per capita electricity consumption is 1003 units with 48,323 million KWh gross electricity supplied in the year 2014-15. The performance of Krishnapatanam thermal power station (2X800 MW) with super critical pressure technology is not satisfactory even after one year commercial operation as the units rarely operate at rated capacity forcing the state to purchase costly power from day ahead trading in IEX.|$|E
50|$|The net {{motive force}} is found by calculating the engine's {{ability to move}} the plane after {{accounting}} for friction and other aerodynamic issues that slow down the plane. The ratio (T-D)/W is similar to T/W, the Thrust-to-weight ratio, which is also used as a figure of merit for airplanes and rockets. By normalizing the motive forces to {{the weight of the}} plane, it is clear how efficient the plane is. A very large engine may be able to generate a huge thrust but could be so heavy that it would not even lift itself. The ratio is unity (T-D)/W = 1 when the engine is only powerful enough to keep the plane at constant speed in a 90 degree ascending trajectory. Fighter jets, such as the F-16 have a T/W ratio close to 1, <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>fuel</b> weight and armament.|$|E

Ammonal's ease of detonation <b>depends</b> <b>on</b> <b>fuel</b> and oxidizer ratios, 95:5 ammonium nitrate and aluminum being fairly sensitive, however not very oxygen balanced. Even copper metal traces are known to sensitize bulk amounts of ammonium nitrate and further increase danger of spontaneous detonation during a fire, most likely due {{to the formation of}} tetramines. More oxygen balanced mixtures are not easily detonated, requiring a fairly substantial shock, though it remains more sensitive than trinitrotoluene and C-4.|$|R

50|$|The KC-135R {{has four}} {{turbofan}} engines, mounted under 35-degree swept wings, which power it to takeoffs at gross weights up to 322500 lb. Nearly all internal fuel can be pumped through the tanker's flying boom, the KC-135's primary fuel transfer method. A special shuttlecock-shaped drogue, attached to and trailing behind the flying boom, {{may be used}} to refuel aircraft fitted with probes. This apparatus is significantly more unforgiving of pilot error in the receiving aircraft than conventional trailing hose arrangements; an aircraft so fitted is also incapable of refueling by the normal flying boom method until the attachment is removed. A boom operator stationed {{in the rear of the}} aircraft controls the boom while lying prone. A cargo deck above the refueling system can hold a mixed load of passengers and cargo. <b>Depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>fuel</b> storage configuration, the KC-135 can carry up to 83000 lb of cargo.|$|E

5000|$|A {{lightweight}} and moderate-speed vehicle with low-friction tires and an efficient chain-driven drivetrain, the bicycle {{is one of}} the most energy-efficient forms of transport. Compared with walking, a 140 lb cyclist riding at 16 km/h requires about half the food energy per unit distance: 43 kcal/mi, 27 kcal/km or [...] per 100 km. This converts to about 732 mpg. This means that a bicycle will use between 10-25 times less energy per distance traveled than a personal car, <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>fuel</b> source and size of the car. This figure does depend on the speed and mass of the rider: greater speeds give higher air drag and heavier riders consume more energy per unit distance. In addition, because bicycles are very lightweight (usually between 7-15 kg) this means they consume very low amounts of materials and energy to manufacture, especially in comparison to an automobile weighing 1500 kg or more. This means that a bicycle typically requires 100-200 times less energy to produce than an automobile, which for an automobile can make up a large portion of its total energy use (as discussed below in the automobile section).|$|E

5000|$|The Tu-144 {{prototype}} was {{a full-scale}} demonstrator aircraft {{with the very}} different production aircraft being developed in parallel. While both Concorde and the Tu-144 prototype had ogival delta wings, the Tu-144's wing lacked Concorde's conical camber. Production Tu-144s replaced this wing with a double delta wing including spanwise and chordwise camber. They also added two small retractable surfaces called Moustache canard, with fixed double-slotted LE slats and retractable double-slotted flaps. These were fitted just behind the cockpit and increased lift at low speeds.Moving the elevons downward in a delta-wing aircraft increases the lift (force), but also pitches its nose downward. The canards cancel out this nose-downwards moment, thus reducing the landing speed of the production Tu-144s to 315 - 333 km/h, still faster than that of Concorde. The NASA study lists final approach speeds during Tu-144LL test flights as 315 - 335 km/h. An FAA circular lists Tu-144S approach speed as 329 km/h, as opposed to Concorde's approach speed of 300 km/h, based on the characteristics declared by the manufacturers to Western regulatory bodies. It is open to argument how stable the Tu-144S was at the listed airspeed. In any event, when NASA subcontracted Tupolev bureau in the 1990s to convert one of the remaining Tu-144D to a Tu-144LL standard, the procedure set by Tupolev for landing defined the Tu-144LL [...] "final approach speed... {{on the order of}} 360 km/h <b>depending</b> <b>on</b> <b>fuel</b> weight." [...] Brian Calvert, Concorde's technical flight manager and its first commercial pilot in command for several inaugural flights, cites final approach speed of a typical Concorde landing to be 287 - 296 km/h. The lower landing speed compared to Tu-144 is due to Concorde's more refined design of the wing profile that provides higher lift at low speeds without degrading supersonic cruise performance - a feature often mentioned in Western publications on Concorde and acknowledged by Tupolev designers as well.|$|E
