40|$|Thesis (LLD (Public Law)) —University of Stellenbosch,In this {{dissertation}} {{a comparative}} study {{is made of}} the constitutional accommodation {{of the distribution of}} financial resources and constitutional obligations to the various spheres of government in Germany and South Africa. Both countries have decentralised or multi-level systems of government and can be classified, in terms of current studies on federalism, as integrated or cooperative federal systems. An overview of the historical developments, the political contexts, the fundamental principles and the constitutional frameworks for government in Germany and South Africa is provided as a basis for the in-depth analysis regarding the financial intergovernmental relations in these countries. This study has shown that economic theory is important in the design of decentralised systems of government and that political and socio-economic considerations, for example, the need for rebuilding Germany after World War II and the need to eliminate severe poverty in South Africa after 1994, often play a dominant role in the design and implementation of decentralised constitutional systems. The economic theory applicable to decentralised systems of government suggests a balanced approach to the distribution of financial resources and constitutional obligations with a view to obtaining the most efficient and equitable solution. In both countries the particular constitutional allocation of obligations and financial resources created a fiscal gap that required some form of revenue sharing or financial equalisation. The German <b>financial</b> <b>equalisation</b> <b>system</b> has been developed over fifty years and is quite complex. It attempts to balance the constitutional aim of reasonable equalisation of the financial disparity of the Länder with the financial autonomy of the Länder as required by the Basic Law. The huge financial and economic demands from the eastern Länder after unification in 1990 placed an additional burden on the available funds and on the <b>financial</b> <b>equalisation</b> <b>system.</b> Germany currently faces reform of its <b>financial</b> <b>equalisation</b> <b>system</b> and possibly also bigger constitutional reform. The South African constitutional system is only a decade old and the <b>financial</b> <b>equalisation</b> <b>system</b> that is less complex than the German system, is functioning reasonably well but needs time to develop to its full potential. The system may however require some adjustment in order to enhance accountability, efficiency and equity. A lack of sufficient skills and administrative capacity at municipal government level and in some provinces hampers service delivery and good governance and places additional pressure on the <b>financial</b> <b>equalisation</b> <b>system.</b> The Bundesverfassungsgericht and the Constitutional Court play important roles in Germany and South Africa in upholding the principle of constitutional supremacy, and make a valuable contribution to the better understanding of the constitutional systems and the further development thereof. This study has shown that clear principles in constitutional texts, for example, such as those contained in the Basic Law, guide the development of applicable financial legislation and add value to the provisions on financial equalisation and how they are implemented. These principles in the Basic Law are justiciable and give the Bundesverfassungsgericht an important tool to adjudicate the financial equalisation legislation. The study of the constitutional accommodation of the distribution of financial resources and constitutional obligations in Germany and South Africa is not an abstract academic exercise and should be seen in the particular political and socio-economic contexts within which the respective constitutions function. The need to give effect to the realisation of socio-economic rights, for example, the right of access to health services, places additional demands on the <b>financial</b> <b>equalisation</b> <b>system.</b> The South African society experienced a major transformation from the apartheid system to a democratic constitutional order that in itself has had a significant influence on financial intergovernmental relations. This dissertation focuses on a distinct part of constitutional law that can be described as financial constitutional law. This comparative analysis of the two countries has provided some lessons for the further development of South Africa’s young democracy, in particular the financial intergovernmental relations system...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the effectiveness of fiscal equalisation instruments in Croatia. Fiscal equalisation policy in Croatia is conducted through the personal income tax revenue sharing and the distribution of current grants from the central government budget to regional and local government units. However, the application of these instruments often relies on criteria that are not economic in nature. Therefore, this paper tests the hypothesis of the ineffectiveness of fiscal <b>equalisation</b> <b>system</b> in Croatia. The Gini coefficients are used to measure inequalities in fiscal capacities of local government units before and after the application of fiscal equalisation instruments. If the value of the Gini coefficient after the application of certain equalisation instrument is lower than before, that instrument is effective in alleviating fiscal inequalities and vice versa. It is found that the Croatian fiscal <b>equalisation</b> <b>system</b> mitigates local fiscal inequalities, but with the negligible effect...|$|R

As part of this, community rating {{has long been a}} cornerstone of the Irish private health insurance market with the objective to make PHI affordable to everyone regardless of their risk profile. Until the mid- 1990 s one insurer had a legal monopoly. However, in 1996, following the Third Non-Life Insurance Directive, the market was opened up to competition and a number of regulations were introduced to support community rating. This includes the introduction of a risk <b>equalisation</b> <b>system.</b> Its aim was to prevent selection and thus protect the community rating system while still enabling a competitive health insurance market. There have been significant obstacles to the introduction of risk equalisation due to political, legal and implementation issues.

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1980 s, the European Communities have seen rapid {{developments}} towards {{economic and political}} integration. This thesis argues that the institutions and decision-making structures of the European Communities resemble those of a union of states {{at an early stage}} of federal integration. However, as an entity with more than one level of government, the Communities are subject to the main objective of federalism: how to simultaneously achieve the contradictory aims of unity and diversity. At the heart of this conflict lies the issue of regional disparities and to what extent within a federal framework such disparities should be reduced.;To answer this question, the thesis undertakes a comparison of the European Communities with a federal entity of similar character, yet one {{at the opposite end of}} the process of integration: the Federal Republic of Germany. As a highly integrated federation within which the centre and the constituent units co-operate strongly with one another, the Federal Republic of Germany provides a good example of how authority may be shared and divided between the Community level and the Member States in future. The degree to which a federal union is politically integrated has a direct effect on the quality of its redistributive policies, and on who will be responsible for those policies.;If the European Union is indeed heading towards more integration, it may one day decide to compensate for more general political unity by shifting responsibility for regional redistribution back to its constituent units. This would mean the adoption of a horizontal <b>financial</b> <b>equalisation</b> scheme amongst the Member States instead of a centrally organised cohesion policy. However, the main lesson from Germany is that <b>financial</b> <b>equalisation</b> does not reduce regional disparities, and that the EU has already found, in the form of the Cohesion Fund, a preferable approach...|$|R

To compensate for their lack of capsize-preventing leverage, they are also allowed to extend the boat's rack outwards, effectively making the boat wider. Conversely, heavier crews will carry fewer weights, but must sail with narrower racks. Thus each team's total weight and leverage is equalised.

40|$|Provision {{for risk}} {{equalisation}} was first {{made in the}} Health Insurance Act, 1994, section 12 of which empowered the Minister to prescribe a scheme for risk equalisation. A Risk Equalsiation Scheme was introduced in 2003. In December 2005, the Minister decided, on the Authority’s recommendation, which referred to risks now materialising, to commence risk equalisation payments under the Scheme as from 1 January 2006, but in the event the relevant legislation was overturned by the Courts in 2008. Since 1994, {{there have been a}} number of studies and reports in relation to risk equalisation in Ireland. As such, the issue of risk equalisation has been the subject of extensive analysis and debate over many years. The arguments of interested parties have been considered throughout and the conclusion has consistently been reached that risk equalisation is necessary in order to maintain community rating. Following the quashing of the 2003 Risk Equalisation Scheme, the Government announced its intention to introduce a new risk <b>equalisation</b> <b>system</b> that is “robust, transparent and effective”.
