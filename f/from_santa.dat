The warning was extended on both coasts from Bahia Magdalena to San Evaristo the next day. About 48hours before Ignacio made landfall, a hurricane warning was issued <b>from</b> <b>Santa</b> Fe to La Paz, and 21hours later extended to Bahia Magdalena and San Evaristo. The government of Mexico also issued a tropical storm warning for the mainland from Atlana to Topolobampo {{in the state of}} Sinaloa.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before it}} was named, the {{government}} of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch {{in the state of}} Baja California Sur, <b>from</b> <b>Santa</b> Fe on the Pacific coast around the peninsula to Buenavista along the Gulf of California. About 24hours prior to landfall, the watch was replaced with a warning <b>from</b> <b>Santa</b> Fe to San Evaristo, and the tropical storm watch was extended along both sides of the peninsula. Prior to it making landfall, more than 2,500families in susceptible areas left their homes. Officials opened several shelters in the area where the storm struck.|$|E

5|$|The city {{is made up}} of {{fourteen}} city districts, according to Republic Act No. 409—the Revised Charter of the City of Manila—the basis of which officially sets the present-day boundary of the city. Two were later added, which are Santa Mesa (partitioned off from Sampaloc) and San Andres (partitioned off <b>from</b> <b>Santa</b> Ana).|$|E
5|$|A {{predecessor}} to {{this road}} ran through Brea Canyon {{by the early}} 20th century and {{was added to the}} state highway system. The freeway was built in stages during the 1950s, one of which included the Brea Canyon Freeway; SR57 was designated as part of the 1964 state highway renumbering. The final portion of the present-day Orange Freeway was not completed until the mid 1970s. The latest piece of SR57 to be added was formerly part of I-210, after SR210 was legislatively extended to San Bernardino in 1998. An unconstructed extension <b>from</b> <b>Santa</b> Ana south to Huntington Beach remains in the legal definition of SR57, and has been studied as a toll road above the Santa Ana River.|$|E

5|$|Angered {{with the}} {{passivity}} of Buenos Aires during the Luso-Brazilian {{invasion of the}} Banda Oriental, Francisco Ramírez from Entre Ríos and Estanislao López <b>from</b> <b>Santa</b> Fe joined forces against the city. Saavedra fled to Montevideo, fearing that Buenos Aires would be obliterated if defeated. Ramírez and López won the battle of Cepeda, but the city was not destroyed, so Saavedra returned. He retired in 1822, and lived {{with his family in}} the countryside. He offered his services {{at the beginning of the}} War of Brazil, despite being 65 years old, but Balcarce declined the offer. He wrote his memoirs, Memoria autógrafa, in 1828.|$|E
5|$|Before the Mexican–American War, {{when this}} area was ceded to the United States, the main trade route through this part of Mexico was the Old Spanish Trail. This trail {{extended}} <b>from</b> <b>Santa</b> Fe, New Mexico to Los Angeles. The trail had multiple routes; however, the main route proceeded north towards Moab, Utah, {{one of the few}} places where the Colorado River can be crossed without having to traverse steep cliffs. The modern US491 roughly correlates with the main route of the Old Spanish Trail between Cortez, Colorado and its northern terminus.|$|E
5|$|Coinciding {{with the}} National Hurricane Center's first {{advisory}} on Isis, {{the government of}} Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Dolores to Puerto Cortés along the Baja California Peninsula. This helped some of the residents get an early start.Early on September 2, the warning was extended <b>from</b> <b>Santa</b> Rosalía to Punta Abreojos, while an additional tropical storm warning was issued from El Dorado to Guaymas. After Isis became a hurricane, officials issued a hurricane warning from Dolores to Punta San Gabriel on the Baja California Peninsula and from El Dorado to Bahía Kino on the mainland.|$|E

5|$|In 1695 {{the colonial}} {{authorities}} decided to act upon {{a plan to}} connect the province of Guatemala with Yucatán, and a three-way invasion of the Lacandon was launched simultaneously from San Mateo Ixtatán, Cobán and Ocosingo. Captain Rodriguez Mazariegos, accompanied by Fray de Rivas and 6 other missionaries together with 50 Spanish soldiers, left Huehuetenango for San Mateo Ixtatán. Following the same route used in 1686, they managed {{on the way to}} recruit 200indigenous Maya warriors <b>from</b> <b>Santa</b> Eulalia, San Juan Solomá and San Mateo. On 28 February 1695, all three groups left their respective bases of operations to conquer the Lacandon. The San Mateo group headed northeast into the Lacandon Jungle, and joined up with Jacinto de Barrios Leal, president of the Royal Audiencia of Guatemala.|$|E

5|$|In December 1987, the Conservancy {{performed}} one of {{its first}} breed rescues when it removed a viable population of Santa Cruz sheep <b>from</b> <b>Santa</b> Cruz Island. The sheep {{were in danger of}} being eradicated by The Nature Conservancy, which was working to save indigenous vegetation that the breed used as food. The first twelve lambs were removed from the island in 1988, with further animals brought to the mainland in 1991. The population now stands at 125 animals and is considered an important genetic resource due to its island heritage, which kept it isolated from other breeds and forced it to adapt to adverse conditions.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to pleas from Travis, James Fannin started from Goliad with 320 men, supplies and armaments, yet had to abort {{a day later}} due to a wagon breakdown. Final reinforcements were able to enter the Alamo during March 1–4, most of them from Gonzales which had become a recruitment camp. Others who had left intending to return were unable to re-enter. At 5:30a.m. on March 6, the Mexican army began the final siege. An hour later, all combatants inside the Alamo were dead. The bodies, {{with the exception of}} Gregorio Esparza's, were cremated on pyres and abandoned. Esparza's brother Francisco was a soldier in the Mexican army and received permission <b>from</b> <b>Santa</b> Anna for a Christian burial.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{surrender}} of Oribe, the Allied forces split into two groups, the plan being for one force to maneuver upriver and sweep down on Buenos Aires <b>from</b> <b>Santa</b> Fe, while the other would make a landing {{at the port of}} Buenos Aires itself. The first of these groups, was composed of Uruguayan and Argentine troops, along with the 1st Division of the Brazilian Army under Brigadier General Manuel Marques de Sousa (later the Count of Porto Alegre). It was initially based in the town of Colonia del Sacramento in the south of Uruguay across the Río de la Plata estuary from the city of Buenos Aires.|$|E

5|$|The city is {{serviced}} by the LRT Line 1 and Line 2, which form the Manila Light Rail Transit System. Development of the railway system {{began in the}} 1970s under the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos, when Line 1 was built, making it the first light rail transport in Southeast Asia. These systems are currently undergoing a multibillion-dollar expansion. Line 1 runs {{along the length of}} Taft Avenue (N170/R-2) and Rizal Avenue (N150/R-9), and Line 2 runs along Claro M. Recto Avenue (N145/C-1) and Ramon Magsaysay Boulevard (N180/R-6) <b>from</b> <b>Santa</b> Cruz, through Quezon City, up to Masinag in Antipolo, Rizal.|$|E
5|$|With {{an area of}} perceptibility {{of around}} 58,500 km2, the shock was felt <b>from</b> <b>Santa</b> Barbara and Bakersfield to San Diego, Palm Springs, and Las Vegas. This is about half the felt area that was seen during the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake, which was felt over an area of 110,000 km2. The maximum {{intensity}} observed in the urban areas that were affected was VII (Very strong), but the intensity in the epicentral area is unknown because of its remote location in the mountainous Angeles National Forest, though rock slides and landslides occurred there {{as a result of}} strong shaking. Intensity VI (Strong) effects were observed over 1,100 km2, from Altadena and La Verne along the base of the mountains, to East Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Following the system's designation, a {{tropical}} storm watch was issued for the southwestern coastline of Mexico stretching from Acapulco to La Fortuna. By 0300UTC on July5, the watch was extended from Acapulco to Manzanillo, while {{a tropical}} storm warning was issued from Lázaro Cárdenas to Manzanillo. Several hours later, the watch was discontinued for the coastline stretching from Acapulco to Lázaro Cárdenas and issued from La Fortuna to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco. Meanwhile, the warning from Lázaro Cárdenas to Manzanillo was discontinued, with a new warning issued from Zihuatanejo to La Fortuna. All tropical storm watches in effect were discontinued by 0300UTC the following morning, with the warning being extended from Zihuatanejo to Cabo Corrientes. After being upgraded to a hurricane, Erick prompted the issuance of hurricane watches stretching from Punta San Telmo to Cabo Corrientes. At 1500UTC on July6, {{a tropical storm}} watch was issued <b>from</b> <b>Santa</b> Fe to La Paz, though this was upgraded to a warning several hours later. Following many other revisions, all tropical cyclone watches and warnings were discontinued after Erick degenerated into a remnant low early on July9.|$|E
