40|$|In September 2005, Wesleyan University Library, Information Technology Services, and the Student Academic Resources Network (SARN), an {{umbrella}} organization {{for a variety}} of services, premiered a prototype Information Commons in Olin Library. Technology assistance, traditional reference, writing tutors and information about academic support services are now in one place, providing one-stop shopping for students. Workstations in the Commons facilitate group and individual work, with or without technology, while fitting aesthetically into a grand space combining traditional and modern elements. Some features of the Commons have been immediately successful, while others are changing to increase usage. Reference staff and student technology consultants work well together and group study is common, but the SARN peer advisors have had to do continual outreach to publicize hidden services. Although envisioned as a prototype group <b>instruction</b> <b>area,</b> faculty has yet to use the Commons as such. The uniqueness of Wesleyan’s information commons, in some ways a virtual commons has created this need for ongoing changes and discussions between departments to clarify budget and management issues.

40|$|Graduation date: 1974 Purpose This study {{compared}} existing Oregon {{elementary school}} physical education facilities and equipment with those facilities and equipment items perceived to be essential for a quality physical education program by nationally selected physical education specialists. Procedures A survey form was mailed to 110 national educators proposed by state directors of physical education as specialists in elementary {{school physical education}} facilities and equipment. Responses were received from 89 (81 percent) of these specialists. The survey form contained 137 items divided into six categories of the instructional complex: (1) community school area, (2) outdoor equipment and surfacing material, (3) outdoor all-weather courts and surface areas, (4) outdoor field areas, (5) dressing-shower-locker areas, and (6) indoor <b>instruction</b> <b>area,</b> courts and equipment. The Oregon survey form contained the items checked as essential by 50 {{percent or more of}} the national jury. The Oregon survey form was mailed to 348 elementary school principals in Oregon requesting indication whether the items were now provided in their schools. From the 348 schools, 329 principals (94. 5 percent) returned the completed survey form. Summary and Conclusions The national jury selected 41 of the 137 items included in the survey as being essential for a quality elementary school physical education program. On the basis of the six areas used from the national survey, the following data was obtained: (1) In the Community School Area, 24 percent of the Oregon elementary schools provide accessible toilet facilities.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a propositIOn about a prevalent urban condition, that of marginal, left over, or disused space. It contends that these spaces, generally viewed as negative attributes by their communities have inherent value, and that appropriate and limited interventions {{will allow for}} new appreciation and greater use of these underutilized urban resources. The site explored in the thesis is an area along the Cambridge and Somerville border between Union Square and the McGrath highway. It supports a variety of light industrial uses that first located there because of proximity to the railroad line. The current actiVities that surround this open area of disused rail sidings are scrap yards, auto parts stores, and warehouses. The open character of the site and the location between residential areas of Cambridge and Somerville give it value. Because of its openness and nearness to dense residential areas it has value as a place from which to view {{the life of the}} city, to understand the history of the industrial worker in Somerville, and the growth of the city. It is a gathering place for young people, who are drawn to these sites partly because of their "unstructured" nature. The program chosen to activate this site is one which brings together a shop or production facility for bicycle frames with complementary uses, including an <b>instruction</b> <b>area</b> for bike repair, meeting rooms for bicycle groups, and a retail store. Additionally, there is an outdoor component to the program that consists of ramps and other architectural features where bicycle riding can take place unimpeded by automobile traffic. In giving this program architectural form, the layering, the additive quality of the surrounding buildings, and the "randomness" of the total environment are accommodated, and its vitality reinforced. The contention of the thesis is that this new set of uses is sensitive to the site, its natural characteristics, its architectural character and its community's needs. Understanding the landscape and the essential quality of a place is a crucial step in determining appropriate design solutions. by Cynthia Mayhew Linton. Thesis (M. Arch.)

50|$|Light {{sensitive}} polymer plates {{allow for}} photorealistic etchings. A photo-sensitive coating {{is applied to}} the plate by either the plate supplier or the artist.

Once the photo-etching process is complete, the plate can be worked further as a normal intaglio plate, using drypoint, further etching, engraving, etc. The final result is an intaglio plate which is printed like any other.|$|R

The former junior high school building was turned over to Glen Burnie High School and was equipped for instruction in Business Education.

40|$|Statics is {{a gateway}} {{engineering}} course. Many students use their {{performance in a}} statics course to evaluate and judge their desire to continue within an engineering field. Students’ performance can be adversely impacted by misconceptions they may have regarding class content and analysis techniques. Feedback from instructors can help students navigate through their misconceptions. It is critical that this feedback be concise and timely to prevent a slip in self-efficacy, or an increase in their frustration. Both factors can negatively impact a student’s desire to persist in engineering. Implementation of online learning logs allows students a timely communication avenue that can reveal to the instructor indications of such factors. This study is designed to explore common misconceptions exhibited through learning logs in a pre-professional engineering statics class. Ninety student logs were consensually evaluated in a fall 2013 statics course delivered at Utah State University. A “discourse analysis” technique was used to review learning log data to discover student’s trouble areas within the class. Results indicate typical stumbling areas that students encounter in a statics course and allow insight into specific <b>instruction</b> <b>areas</b> {{that need to be}} refined to better deliver content to the class as well as individuals...|$|R
