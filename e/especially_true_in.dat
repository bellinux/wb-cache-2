5|$|Stalin's {{willingness}} to expend recently conscripted armies, which were poorly trained and poorly supplied, illustrated a misconception of realities, {{both in the}} capabilities of the Red Army and the subordinate arms of the armed forces, and in the abilities of the Germans to defend themselves and successfully launch a counteroffensive. The latter proved <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the subsequent Case Blue, which led to the Battle of Stalingrad, though this was the battle in which Paulus faced an entirely different outcome.|$|E
5|$|A study {{published}} in 2000 by researchers from the University of Georgia and the US Fish and Wildlife Service looked at data collected between 1986 and 1990 {{in an effort to}} better understand the herd dynamics of the Cumberland Island herd. The study found that band instability was high, with mares not generally forming close relationships with each other and commonly switching which stallion they banded with, and juveniles dispersing quickly. The researchers attributed this to a lack of territory, with bands frequently inhabiting overlapping areas, along with a high number of bachelor stallions (those without mares). They also saw a high number of co-dominant stallions, where two or more stallions would lead a band together, and alternate breeding of the band's mares. Foals born on Cumberland Island were less likely to survive than comparable foals in western feral herds, with survival rates of 58.8-61.1% and 80% respectively. This was found to be <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> animals born after 1 June, which was attributed to higher temperatures, higher insect levels and reduced food availability. The number of horses in the Cumberland bands was comparable to western bands and those on some eastern islands. However, Assateague and Shackleford Banks horses tended to have larger bands, with an average of 8.1 and 12.3 horses per band, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Coke's {{advertising}} is pervasive, {{as one of}} Woodruff's stated goals was to ensure that everyone on Earth drank Coca-Cola as their preferred beverage. This is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> southern areas of the United States, such as Atlanta, where Coke was born.|$|E
50|$|Individuals who {{expressed}} lactase-persistent phenotypes {{would have had}} a significant advantage in nutritional acquisition. This is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> for societies <b>in</b> which the domestication of milk-producing animals and pastoralism became a main way of life.|$|R
5000|$|A {{detailed}} {{treatment of}} {{the various types of}} dogs, their virtues and rights are given in Fargard 13, 14, and 15 of the Vendidad. [...] "Dogs", <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> dogs <b>in</b> the biological sense (Canis lupus familiaris, whether domestic or stray), are considered to deserve respect and protection; there are detailed prescriptions concerning the care which is due to them and the harsh punishments for those who harm them. For more details, see Dogs in Zoroastrianism.|$|R
5000|$|... zilch, nada (from Spanish), zip: used informally when {{stressing}} nothingness; this is <b>true</b> <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> {{combination with}} one another ("You know nothing - zero, zip, nada, zilch!"); American usage ...|$|R
25|$|The {{possibility}} of other causes of ulcers, notably malignancy (gastric cancer) {{needs to be}} kept in mind. This is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> ulcers of the greater (large) curvature of the stomach; most are also a consequence of chronic H. pylori infection.|$|E
25|$|The {{roles of}} women in Christianity can vary {{considerably}} today as they have varied historically since the third century New Testament church. This is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> marriage and in formal ministry positions within certain Christian denominations, churches, and parachurch organizations.|$|E
25|$|This is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> {{the area}} of Labor and Employment law. In Canada a {{fiduciary}} has obligations to the employer even after the employment relationship is terminated, whereas in the United States the employment and fiduciary relationships terminate together.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Canadian Partnership Initiative of the United Nations Water for Life Decade is to {{translate}} scientific research outcomes into language the average person can understand and that decision-makers can act upon {{in a timely manner}} to address water-related climate change impacts. It is estimated, climate change has the potential to create a perfect environmental cum economic cum social cum political storm. It is a storm, however, that can be avoided. That is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> here, <b>in</b> the north east of America...|$|R
50|$|Many Confucians also {{realized}} that loyalty and filial piety have the potential of coming into conflict with one another. This can be <b>true</b> <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> times of social chaos, such as {{during the period of}} the Ming-Qing transition.|$|R
5000|$|Scheduling multivariable {{controllers}} {{is often}} a tedious and time-consuming task and it holds <b>true</b> <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> the field of aerospace control where the parameter dependency of controllers are large due to increased operating envelopes with more demanding performance requirements.|$|R
25|$|As governor, Pliny held large {{influence}} {{over all of}} the residents of his province. This was <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the legal treatment of Christians. The Roman legal construct of cognitio extra ordinem afforded governors a large amount of discretion in deciding legal cases.|$|E
25|$|Since most Singaporean Chinese {{trace their}} ancestral home to {{southern}} China, their culture generally has a closer affinity with southern Chinese culture (predominantly that of Fujian, Guangdong and Hainan) This is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> terms of various southern Chinese dialects, customs, cultural, and religious practices in Singapore.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the recent}} upsurge in {{the motif of}} heroic werewolves, unsympathetic portrayals of werewolves as monsters also {{continue}} to be common in popular culture. This is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> movies, which are only slowly incorporating trends in written fiction. There are very few werewolf movies outside the horror genre.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes {{source code}} {{contains}} a novel or noteworthy {{solution to a}} specific problem. In such cases, comments may contain {{an explanation of the}} methodology. Such explanations may include diagrams and formal mathematical proofs. This may constitute explanation of the code, rather than a clarification of its intent; but others tasked with maintaining the code base may find such explanation crucial. This might <b>especially</b> be <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the case of highly specialized problem domains; or rarely used optimizations, constructs or function-calls.|$|R
25|$|However, {{although}} the Philippine educational system has extensively {{been a model}} for other Southeast Asian countries, in recent years such a matter has no longer stood true, and such a system has been deteriorated - such a fact is <b>especially</b> evident and <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the country's more secluded poverty-stricken regions.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} an effort {{is made to}} review {{comprehensively}} the requirements for business administration degrees in the larger {{colleges and universities in}} Texas. The development and adaptation of uniform requirements in any field of study are necessarily slow processes and subject to frequent revision. <b>Especially</b> is this <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the field of business education...|$|R
25|$|The total (harmful) air {{emissions}} produced by wood kilns, including their heat source, can be significant. Typically, {{the higher the}} temperature the kiln operates at, the larger amount of emissions are produced (per pound of water removed). This is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the drying of thin veneers and high-temperature drying of softwoods.|$|E
25|$|Fear {{of the pit}} getting filled: In some places, {{people are}} scared that their toilet pits will get filled very fast if all family members use it everyday. So they {{continue}} {{to go out to}} delay the toilet pit filling up. This is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the case of a pit latrine.|$|E
25|$|Too {{many people}} using a toilet: This is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> case of shared or public toilets. If {{too many people}} want to use a toilet at the same time, then some people may go outside to defecate instead of waiting. In some cases, people {{might not be able to}} wait due to {{diarrhea}} (or result of an Irritable Bowel Syndrome emergency).|$|E
50|$|The {{classical}} {{example of}} a church by this definition is the Catholic Church, especially in the past, such as the State church of the Roman Empire. Today, the Catholic Church has been forced into the denomination category because of religious pluralism, or competition among religions. This is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> of Catholicism <b>in</b> the United States. The change from a church to a denomination is still under way in many Latin American countries {{where the majority of}} citizens remain Catholics.|$|R
5000|$|... ″Most people pretend not {{to believe}} in ghosts. But there is an {{abundance}} of literature on the phenomenon of ghosts for us {{to step back and}} question that belief. This is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> of ghosts <b>in</b> the Law. How else would one describe the Doctrine of Precedent or Stare Decisis? It is the dogma which says an English case decided in 1820 can still determine the way a Ugandan court in 2015 will make its decision.″ ...|$|R
30|$|Turning to {{the area}} of specialization, {{compared}} to a person with general education, a person with an industrial or scientific specialization, or tertiary, health and social science specializations, have lower recurrence. This finding is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> for persons <b>in</b> the health and social specialization who rarely experience unemployment. The effect is much lower for the tertiary sector. The results obtained for educational and specialization variables suggest an important role played by these variables as an explanation for the recurrence of unemployment.|$|R
25|$|In {{contrast}} to ONE, Inc. studies, more conservative homophile organizations of the 1950s, {{such as the}} Daughters of Bilitis, discouraged butch-femme roles and identities. This was <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> relation to the butch identity, as the organization held the belief that assimilation into heterosexual society was {{the goal of the}} homophile movement. Gender expressions outside of the norm prevented assimilation.|$|E
25|$|This is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> New York City, where 28% of rent {{stabilized}} tenants {{spend more}} than half their income on rent. Among lower income families the percentage is much higher. According to an estimate by the Community Service Society, 65% of New York City families living below the federal poverty line are paying {{more than half of}} their income toward rent.|$|E
25|$|Catherine de' Medici spent extravagant sums on the {{building}} and embellishment of monuments and palaces, and as the country slipped deeper into anarchy, her plans grew ever more ambitious. Yet the Valois monarchy was crippled by debt and its moral authority in steep decline. The popular view condemned Catherine's building schemes as obscenely wasteful. This was <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> Paris, where the parlement was often asked to contribute to her costs.|$|E
30|$|In conclusion, {{piperylene}} sulfone and butadiene sulfone {{have been}} shown to be recyclable solvents as a consequence of the reversible reactions between SO 2 and the respective diene. They are dipolar, aprotic solvents and serve as potential substitutes for DMSO. This is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> for BS <b>in</b> the synthesis of organic azides by nucleophilic substitution and, tetrazoles by the reaction of organic azides with p-toluenesulfonyl cyanide (3). Both reactions using sulfolene solvent have noticeable advantages: operational simplicity, low cost and environmental safety.|$|R
40|$|Concentration is {{a general}} tendency, which led to {{strengthening}} the position of commerce all over the world. One of the consequences are the intensified conflicts between the large- and small-scale production deriving from the differences in volume, selection, quality and price {{as well as in}} capital supply, organisation, logistics, IT and innovation. In the supply chain the position of the small-scale producers with poor assortment is the weakest. This <b>especially</b> holds <b>true</b> <b>in</b> respect of Hungary and first of all in the vegetable and fruit sector, where the majority of the producers are smallholdings producing and making decisions on production and sale isolated and separately...|$|R
50|$|DiseasesWhilst {{reservoirs}} {{are helpful}} to humans, {{they can also}} be harmful as well. One negative effect is that the reservoirs can become breeding grounds for disease vectors. This holds <b>true</b> <b>especially</b> <b>in</b> tropical areas where mosquitoes (which are vectors for malaria) and snails (which are vectors for Schistosomiasis) can take advantage of this slow flowing water.|$|R
25|$|Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch {{surfaces}} {{can prevent}} frequently touched surfaces from serving as reservoirs for {{the spread of}} pathogenic microbes. This is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> healthcare facilities, where harmful viruses, bacteria, and fungi colonize and persist on doorknobs, push plates, railings, tray tables, tap (faucet) handles, IV poles, HVAC systems, and other equipment. These microbes can often survive on surfaces for surprisingly {{long periods of time}} (sometimes more than 30 days).|$|E
25|$|Unlike the NFLY, the new YCL {{was largely}} sidelined by more radical youth groups {{aligned with the}} New Left. This was <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the student movement, where it was unable to play an {{effective}} role in preventing {{the dissolution of the}} Canadian Student Union in the late 1960s. The re-founded YCL was active in campaigns such as support for the Cuban Revolution, opposition to the Vietnam War, and solidarity with the people of Chile and South Africa.|$|E
25|$|From {{the late}} 1920s {{and into the}} 1930s, {{particularly}} during the tenure of Japanese Governor-General Kazushige Ugaki, concentrated {{efforts were made to}} build up the industrial base in Korea. This was <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the areas of heavy industry, such as chemical plants and steel mills, and munitions production. The Japanese military felt it would be beneficial to have production closer to the source of raw materials and closer to potential front lines for a future war with China.|$|E
50|$|Plus-size {{model is}} term applied to an {{individual}} of average to larger stature (sometimes but not exclusively overweight or obese) who is engaged primarily in modeling plus-size clothing. Plus-size models also engage in work that is not strictly related to selling large-sized clothing, e.g., stock photography and advertising photography for cosmetics, household and pharmaceutical products and sunglasses, footwear and watches. Therefore, plus-size models do not exclusively wear garments marketed as plus-size clothing. This is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> when participating <b>in</b> fashion editorials for mainstream fashion magazines.|$|R
25|$|The specialists {{fell into}} three categories. First there were species describers, then specialists in species {{recognition}} and then specialists in gross taxonomy. There were however considerable degrees of overlap. Also then, as now, few could entirely resist {{the lure of}} groups other than their own, and this was <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> of those <b>in</b> small countries where they were the sole 'expert', and many famous specialists in one order also worked on others. Hence, for instance, many works which began as butterfly faunas were completed as general regional works, often collaboratively.|$|R
5000|$|As English {{continues}} {{to become a}} [...] "world language", English language skills are becoming more important for people all across the world. This is <b>especially</b> <b>true</b> for people <b>in</b> developing countries, where having good English can open up new jobs and educational opportunities. Openmind Projects has English teaching placements in northeastern and southern Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Nepal. Placements include such things as primary and secondary schools, nurseries, orphanage homes, national parks, and more. By teaching English in poor communities language skills, lives and future prospects are improved.|$|R
