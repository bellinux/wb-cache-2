50|$|The {{simplest}} {{and most}} cost-effective safety device is the rupture disk. Incorporated into the pressure vessel in fabrication, {{this is simply}} a port in the vessel closed off by a finely machined plate that will burst at a predetermined pressure. This plate may be made of either aluminum or carbon. The disk is fitted within a <b>flanged</b> <b>assembly</b> that discharges the autoclave's pressure out into an exhaust pipe to carry the whoosh well away from personnel. The disk is fairly inexpensive and can be replaced easily. The rupture disk {{should be used to}} back up the safety valve and sized to drop internal pressure as quickly as possible. Autoclave fires can release considerable energy into the air inside, resulting in a sudden pressure spike. The rupture disk is designed to release at a pressure slightly above that of the ASME safety valve and well below that of the hydrostatic test; it is never called into play unless there is a sudden pressure increase beyond the capacity of the safety valve. The very modest cost of even a pair of fairly large rupture disks makes this an extremely attractive option. The rupture disk should be not less than twice the diameter of the inlet to or the outlet from the vessel, whichever is larger.|$|E
50|$|Metal {{diaphragms}} {{of stainless}} steel (several grades), Carpenter 20, Hastelloy, Monel, Inconel, tantalum, titanium and several other metals are in common use where high pressure ratings and specific chemical compatibility are required. <b>Flanged</b> <b>assemblies</b> or flush welded versions are available.|$|R
5000|$|In 1971, DW {{introduced}} the Models 14 (fixed sights) and 15 (adjustable sights) in [...]357 Magnum caliber. The new models still used the [...] "pork chop" [...] <b>flanged</b> barrel <b>assembly,</b> but the muzzle nut was redesigned and recessed inside the shroud {{to improve the}} gun's appearance. As a result, barrel change tools for the Models 12 and 15 are non-interchangeable. [...] Another new feature was {{the introduction of a}} mechanical stop to prevent trigger overtravel, which reduces the effect of trigger movement on the gun itself while reducing trigger return time, thus increasing accuracy. [...] Models W11 and W12 were discontinued in 1974.|$|R
