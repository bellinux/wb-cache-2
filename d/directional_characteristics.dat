25|$|The inner {{elements}} of a microphone are {{the primary source of}} differences in directivity. A pressure microphone uses a diaphragm between a fixed internal volume of air and the environment, and responds uniformly to pressure from all directions, so it is said to be omnidirectional. A pressure-gradient microphone uses a diaphragm that is at least partially open on both sides. The pressure difference between the two sides produces its <b>directional</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Other elements such as the external shape of the microphone and external devices such as interference tubes can also alter a microphone's directional response. A pure pressure-gradient microphone is equally sensitive to sounds arriving from front or back, but insensitive to sounds arriving from the side because sound arriving at the front and back at the same time creates no gradient between the two. The characteristic directional pattern of a pure pressure-gradient microphone is like a figure-8. Other polar patterns are derived by creating a capsule that combines these two effects in different ways. The cardioid, for instance, features a partially closed backside, so its response is a combination of pressure and pressure-gradient characteristics.|$|E

Therefore, if only one of the two directional modes in the final mode candidates is chosen, the computational cost can be further reduced.|$|R

40|$|Abstract —Digital halftoning is {{a process}} to convert a continuous-tone image into a binary image with black and white dots. This process is {{necessary}} to print a continuous-tone image using printers. The Error Diffusion {{is one of the}} most popular methods of digital halftoning, because it can generates high quality output images with relatively low computing time. Binary images generated by the Error Diffusion are fine grained in the sense that they have a lot of isolated small black and white dots. However, fine binary images are not appropriate for practical printing, because isolated black and white dots may disappear by dot-gain or dot-loss. Hence cluster-dot halftoning, which generates binary images has no isolated black and white dots are important. It is known that the Error Diffusion with some feedback operation can generate clustered-dot binary images. However, the resulting binary images have strong <b>directional</b> <b>characteristic,</b> which spoils the printing results. The main contribution of this paper is to presents new filters of the Error Diffusion for cluster-dot halftoning with no <b>directional</b> <b>characteristic.</b> Quite surprisingly, it can generate cluster-dot binary images with no <b>directional</b> <b>characteristic</b> using our new filter. Also, the size of cluster can be adjusted by an additional feedback operation. The experimental results show that the Error Diffusion using our new filter can generate better quality binary images than the previously published know results...|$|R

At least four rows of permanent magnet segments (2, 12, 22, 32) are provided, whereby two adjacent rows of magnetic segments (2, 12; 12, 22; 22, 32; 32, 2) are displaced by a quarter of a periodicity of individual permanent magnets (1) of every row (2, 12, 22, 32) along their longitudinal axis.

5000|$|Antennas are {{characterized}} {{by a number of}} performance measures which a user would be concerned with in selecting or designing an antenna for a particular application. Chief among these relate to the <b>directional</b> <b>characteristics</b> (as depicted in the antenna's radiation pattern) and the resulting gain. Even in omnidirectional (or weakly directional) antennas, the gain can often be increased by concentrating more of its power in the horizontal directions, sacrificing power radiated toward the sky and ground. The antenna's power gain (or simply [...] "gain") also takes into account the antenna's efficiency, and is often the primary figure of merit.|$|E

50|$|With {{this system}} are frequency-independent level {{differences}} effective {{and time of}} arrival differences working {{together in the same}} direction as interchannel signals (interchannel loudspeaker signals). This technique leads to a realistic stereo effect and has a reasonable mono-compatibility. These interchannel differences have nothing to do with interaural differences which come only from artificial head recordings. Even the spacing of a = 30 cm has nothing to do with human ear distance, because a useful microphone system for a set of stereo loudspeakers should be developed and not for ear phones. This recording technology is called mixed stereo or equivalence stereo. Usually this special microphone system must be built up from two single small diaphragm microphones.
