40|$|Understanding {{the fate}} and <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>effects</b> of {{pesticides}} largely {{depends on their}} molecular properties. We recentlydeveloped BTyPol^ (Typology of Pollutants), a classification method of organic compounds based on statistical analyses. Itcombines several environmental (sorption coefficient, degradation half-life) and one ecotoxicological (bioconcentration factor) parameters, to structural molecular descriptors (number of atoms in the molecule, molecular surface, dipole moment, energy oforbitals, etc.). The present study attempts to extend TyPol to the <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>effects</b> of pesticides on non-target organisms,based on data analysis from available literature and databases. It revealed that relevant ecotoxicological endpoints for terrestrialorganisms (e. g., soil microorganisms, invertebrates) that support a range of ecosystemic services are lacking as compared toaquatic organisms. The availability of ecotoxicological parameters was also lower for chronic than for acute ecotoxicity endpoints. Consequently, seven parameters were included for acute (EC 50, LC 50) and chronic (NOEC) <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>effects</b> forone terrestrial (Eisenia sp.) and three aquatic (Daphnia sp., algae, Lemna sp.) organisms. In this new configuration, we usedTyPol to classify 50 pesticides into different clusters that gather molecules with similar environmental behaviors and ecotoxicologicaleffects.

On the one hand, standardized bioassays are applied in ASKURIS, e.g. Daphnia immortality (ISO 6341 : 1996, DIN 38412 – 30 : 1989 – 03) and Aliivibrio fischeri bioluminescence (ISO 11348 – 3 : 2007, DIN 38412 – 37 : 1999 – 04). The conventional tests are based on mortality rates or growth inhibition after short-term exposure. Acetylcholinesterase inhibition (DIN 34815 – 1 : 1995 – 02) is applied for neurotoxic effects, and the UmuC test (ISO 13829 : 2000, DIN 38415 – 3 : 1996 – 12) gives information about genotoxic effects. On the other hand, a novel biotest with macrophytes (Myriophyllum spicatum) is used to assess different physiological parameters such as biotransformation enzymes (glutathione S-transferase) and enzymes for the mitigation of oxidative stress (peroxidase or superoxide dismutase).

30|$|However, for GMOs, no such {{validation}} {{studies have}} been conducted so far (see also “The role of the LoC in the stepwise testing approach of the ERA of GMOs” section). It is questionable whether effect sizes of 20 % or smaller are reliable predictors of harmless effects on a range of non-target organisms in the field, when testing the GMO at lower tier, e.g. in the laboratory. In particular, if the 20 % value is used for laboratory mortality data, it would also have to cover sub-lethal and reproductive effects that might occur under field conditions. Additionally, any decision on acceptable effect sizes for laboratory testing should take into consideration that, e.g. for mites, mortalities of 20 – 25 % in the control group are accepted validity criteria for <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>effect</b> testing of chemicals or plant protection products [50, 51]. Although LoCs should be set independently from acceptable control mortalities for standardised ecotoxicological testing protocols, these must be kept in mind when deciding on acceptable effect sizes for laboratory tests using non-target organisms.|$|E

In this context, identification of biological pathways that could be disrupted in nontargeted aquatic species using qualitative preclinical/clinical data associated to toxicological data appears as a promising approach.

Numerous studies have reported that imidazoles and triazoles, which are used in antifungal and anti-tumoral therapies respectively, are steroidogenesis disruptors due to their adverse or therapeutic mechanism of action based on inhibition of cytochromes enzymatics complexes. However, other azole APIs such as protons pump inhibitors, carbimazole, triptans, sartans, setrons, allopurinol, aciclovir, zolpidem, theophyllin exhibit various biological activities. Pharmacodynamical data on targeted and adverse effects could allow identifying <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>effects,</b> 'Drugs Interactions' data and 'Contraindications/Precautions for uses' data may also inform about possible mixture effects and interactions with pathological contexts. Preliminary results, qualitative pharmacological data indicate possible deleterious effects of protons pump inhibitors (benzimidazole compounds) on acid excretion and Na+ uptake in gill via interference with Na+/H+ exchanger localized in gill epithelial pavement cells, especially in hypercapnia/hypoxia contexts. These disruptions may imply deleterious consequences on vital functions as respiration, iono and osmoregulation, excretion.

30|$|In {{response}} to the growing public concern about heavy metal pollution, {{there has been an}} increase in the monitoring of heavy metal concentrations in aquatic systems globally. In Nigeria, several studies have determined the presence of heavy metals in various environmental compartments and biota especially in the Nigeria Delta region. This area is noted for its massive oil production activities that have led to increased rate of heavy metal contamination and pollution. At present, assessment and monitoring of heavy metal contamination in the Niger Delta mainly the Benin River has been predominately based on chemical analysis of environmental compartments of water, sediment, and soil alone. This step is fundamentally insufficient in deriving the potential toxicity of contaminated environmental samples. Moreover, chemical analysis on abiotic compartments cannot directly assess the antagonistic or synergistic effects as well as the bioavailability of toxicants to organisms because the magnitude of contamination does not necessarily reflect a similar level of <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>effect</b> (Barhoumi et al. 2016).

It was suggested that the photodegradation of herbicides due to sunlight results in a greater demand of herbicides to be introduced into the environment {{in order to ensure}} the plant protection activity. Moreover, an <b>ecotoxicological</b> <b>effect</b> of the photoproducts needs to be clarified. The physiological response of Zea mays and Sinapis alba (weed) to sulcotrione and its main photoproduct, called chromone (xanthene- 1, 9 -dione- 3, 4 -dihydro- 6 -methylsulfonyl), was evaluated under controlled conditions in a growth chamber. The dose-response effects were determined on Z. mays and S. alba. Using the sulcotrione (doses ranging from 1 to 9 mg per plant), the physiological parameters indicated a decrease of photosynthesis for the S. alba species while the Z. mays species were only slightly affected. On the contrary, the chromone had no herbicide activity on both species. The sulcotrione is known to block 4 -hydroxyphenyl pyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) enzyme. The differences between the parent herbicide and the photoproduct could be ascribed to drastic structural modifications.
