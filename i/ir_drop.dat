High on-chip currents, required to charge and discharge large on-chip loads while operating at high frequencies, produce significant transient <b>IR</b> voltage <b>drops</b> within a power distribution network.

The impact {{of the increase in}} power is multi-discipline to researchers ranging from power supply design, power converters or voltage regulators design, system, board and package thermal analysis, power grid design and signal integrity analysis to minimizing power itself. This work focuses on challenges arising due to increase in power to power grid design and analysis. Challenges arising due to lower geometries and higher power are very well researched topics and there is still lot of scope to continue work. Traditionally, designs go through average <b>IR</b> <b>drop</b> analysis. Average <b>IR</b> <b>drop</b> analysis is highly dependent on current dissipation estimation. This work proposes a vector less probabilistic toggle estimation which is extension of one of the approaches proposed in literature. We have further used toggles computed using this approach to estimate power of ISCAS 89 benchmark circuits. This provides insight into quality of toggles being generated. Power Estimation work is further extended to comprehend with various state of the art methodologies available i. e. spice based power estimation, logic simulation based power estimation, commercially available tool comparisons etc. We finally arrived at optimum flow recommendation which can be used as per design need and schedule. Today’s design complexity – high frequencies, high logic densities and multiple level clock and power gating - has forced design community to look beyond average <b>IR</b> <b>drop.</b> High rate of switching activities induce power supply fluctuations to cells in design which is known as instantaneous <b>IR</b> <b>drop.</b> However, there is no good analysis methodology in place to analyze this phenomenon.
