40|$|This paper {{describes}} the <b>site</b> <b>survey</b> issues when deploying a wireless {{local area network}} (WLAN), the implementation of a location system over the deployed network, and the application of a Kalman filtering algorithm to enhance the tracking performance. We <b>have</b> made a <b>site</b> <b>survey</b> in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (EECE) department of University of New Mexico (UNM) to optimally position the access points. Ekahau Positioning Engine [1] was used to find the coverage areas of all available access points throughout the building. After having the network up and running, the signal strength values at certain locations are recorded and an indoor propagation analysis is made. A nearest neighbors algorithm and its variants are used to construct a location system and possible ways of improvements are discussed. Improvements in the estimation error using a Kalman filter algorithm are then presented...|$|R

40|$|Booms {{have the}} {{objective}} of intercepting litter from the stormwater system so it can be collected before entering waterways. So far, a literature review <b>has</b> been completed, <b>site</b> <b>surveys</b> of existing booms and inspections of litter removal procedures. A number of boom sites in Sydney were studied: Dobroyd Canal, Hawthorne Canal, Blackwattle Bay, Rushcutters Bay, Mosman Bay, and Centennial Park (Musgrave Pond and Model Yacht Pond.) These are not performing well, especially during high flows. Removal of litter is not based on the factors affecting performance, tide, wind and runoff. Gaps, tears and sinking also create problems.

5|$|The Marquesses of Bute {{acquired}} the castle in 1776. John Stuart, the first marquess, {{took steps to}} protect the ruins. His great-grandson John Crichton-Stuart, the third marquess, was immensely rich {{as the result of}} the family's holdings in the South Wales coalfields and was passionately interested in the medieval period. He <b>had</b> the <b>site</b> fully <b>surveyed</b> by the architect William Frame, and reroofed the great hall in the 1870s. The marquess began a process of buying back leasehold properties around the castle with the intent of clearing back the town houses that had been built up to the edge of the site.|$|R
50|$|Port Douglas was {{established}} {{shortly after the}} discovery of gold on the Hodgkinson River in 1876. At this time the nearest port was Cairns, which was only accessible over difficult and mountainous terrain. In 1877, well-known bushman Christy Palmerston discovered a new route which gave easier access from the goldfields to the coast. By {{the end of the}} year, the <b>site</b> <b>had</b> been <b>surveyed,</b> declared a port of entry and clearance and officially named Port Douglas.|$|R
50|$|The <b>site</b> <b>has</b> {{undergone}} several <b>site</b> <b>surveys</b> {{and some}} excavations during its modern history. Eli Lilly and the Indiana Historical Society employed E.Y. Guernsey {{to carry out}} surveys and excavations at Clark County sites in the early 1930s. He noted three of the mounds at the site, the smallest of which he partially excavated and the largest he examined. Guernsey noted several different types of mortuary practices at the sites, including stone box graves and several flexed and extended burials beneath a fired clay floor. He also discovered typical Mississippian culture pottery, known for its use of crushed marine shells as a tempering agent, a stone discoidal associated with the game of chunkey, a shell gorget and a copper-covered, carved wooden raptorial bird covered in beaten copper. The present whereabouts {{of all of the}} artifacts he collected are not currently known, but some are curated at the Glenn Black Laboratory of Archaeology at Indiana University-Bloomington, and at the University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology.|$|R
25|$|When Morley and {{his team}} {{returned}} in 1924 to commence their excavations, Chichen Itza was a sprawling complex of several large ruined buildings and many smaller ones, most of which lay concealed under mounds of earth and vegetation.

30|$|Typically, <b>site</b> <b>survey</b> is an {{inevitable}} phase for WiFi fingerprint-based localization which {{is regarded as}} one of the most promising techniques for indoor localization. However, the <b>site</b> <b>survey</b> can cause potential location privacy leakage for the participants who contribute their WiFi fingerprint measurements. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving <b>site</b> <b>survey</b> scheme for WiFi fingerprint-based localization. In the proposed scheme, we use homomorphic encryption to protect the location privacy of the participants which get involved in the <b>site</b> <b>survey.</b> Further, we employ differential privacy model to ensure that the released data will not breach an individual’s location privacy regardless of whether she is present or absent in the <b>site</b> <b>survey</b> group. We theoretically analyze the security of the proposed scheme and use simulation experiments on a real-world data to validate the efficiency of the proposed scheme.|$|R
