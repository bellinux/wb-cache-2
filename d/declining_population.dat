5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, the steel {{industry}} in Pittsburgh began to implode along with the deindustrialization of the U.S. Following the 1981–1982 recession, for example, the mills laid off 153,000 workers. The steel mills began to shut down. These closures caused a ripple effect, as railroads, mines, and other factories across the region lost business and closed. The local economy suffered a depression, marked by high unemployment and underemployment, as laid-off workers took lower-paying, non-union jobs. Pittsburgh suffered as elsewhere in the Rust Belt with a <b>declining</b> <b>population,</b> and like many other U.S. cities, it also saw white flight to the suburbs.|$|E

5|$|Experimental {{breeding}} {{programs in}} the early 20th century succeeded in re-establishing the breed to some extent, but mechanization, combined with two world wars, again resulted in the breed almost becoming extinct. In the 1980s, concerned with the <b>declining</b> <b>population</b> numbers, interested breeders undertook a promotional program, which resulted in renewed interest in the breed. By the 1990s, population numbers were higher, and genetic studies in 1998 and 2012 found relatively high levels of genetic diversity for a small breed. However, livestock conservation organizations still consider the breed to be at risk, due to low population numbers.|$|E
5|$|Grey jays are {{classified}} as least concern (LC) according to the IUCN Red List, having stable populations over a very large area of boreal and subalpine habitats only lightly occupied by humans. Significant human impacts may nevertheless occur through anthropogenic climate warming. Grey jays at the northern edges of their range may benefit from the extension of spruce stands out onto formerly treeless tundra. A study of a <b>declining</b> <b>population</b> {{at the southern end}} of the grey jay's range linked the decline in reproductive success to warmer temperatures in preceding autumns. Such warm temperatures may trigger spoilage of the perishable food items stored by grey jays upon which success of late winter nesting partly depends.|$|E
5|$|The American {{black duck}} is {{considered}} to be aspecies of least concernby theInternational Union for Conservation of Nature(IUCN). It has long been valued as a game bird. Habitat loss due to drainage, global warming, filling of wetlands due to urbanization and rising sea levels are major reasons for the <b>declining</b> <b>population</b> of the American black duck. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has been purchasing and managing the habitat of this species in many areas to support the migratory stopover, wintering and breeding populations. The Atlantic Coast Joint Venture also protects habitat through restoration and land acquisition projects, mostly within their wintering and breeding areas.|$|E

5|$|Wolf populations {{throughout}} Northern and Central Asia {{are largely}} unknown, but are estimated {{in the hundreds}} of thousands based on annual harvests. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, continent-wide extermination of wolves has ceased, and wolf populations have increased to about 25,000–30,000 animals throughout the former Soviet Union. In China and Mongolia, wolves are only protected in reserves. Mongolian populations have been estimated at 10,000–30,000, while the status of wolves in China is more fragmentary. The north has a <b>declining</b> <b>population</b> of an estimated 400 wolves, while Xinjiang and Tibet hold about 10,000 and 2,000 respectively.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} half of the twentieth century, the <b>declining</b> <b>population</b> trend had gone into reverse. Increasing numbers of retired people were {{arriving}} to make their home in the tranquil surroundings, and after the Beacham Commission in the 1960s, the British government realised that the rural way of life in parts of Wales was in crisis, and started to react. Through government initiatives and local actions, opportunities in tourism, rural crafts, specialist food shops, farmers' markets and added-value food products began to emerge. However, in 2011, at 3.1%, Ceredigion still had one of the highest proportions of its population working in agriculture, forestry and fishing, close behind such other places as Orkney and Shetland. Another use for marginal land in exposed positions is the provision of renewable wind energy; Cefn Croes Wind Farm near Devil's Bridge has 39 turbines and a nominal capacity of 58,500kW.|$|E

40|$|The {{pollination}} {{characteristics of}} blowout penstemon (Penstemon haydenii S. Wats.), the only officially {{endangered plant species}} in Nebraska, were investigated. Cross-pollination {{was determined to be}} the major method of pollination, but self-pollination also occurs. Insects increased cross-pollination. The natural habitat of blowout penstemon has greatly decreased during this century, resulting in only a few isolated populations. The opportunity for cross-pollination with other populations no longer exists.

5|$|Since 1988, the American {{black duck}} has been rated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species. This {{is because the}} range of this species is {{extremely}} large, which is not near the threshold of vulnerable species. In addition, the total population is large, and, although it is declining, it is not declining fast {{enough to make the}} species vulnerable. It has long been valued as a game bird, being extremely wary and fast flying. Habitat loss due to drainage, filling of wetlands due to urbanization, global warming and rising sea levels are major reasons for the <b>declining</b> <b>population.</b> Some conservationists consider hybridization and competition with the mallard as an additional source of concern should this decline continue. Hybridization itself is not a major problem; natural selection makes sure that the best-adapted individuals have the most offspring. However, the reduced viability of female hybrids causes some broods to fail in the long run due to the death of the offspring before reproducing themselves. While this is not a problem in the plentiful mallard, it might place an additional strain on the American black duck's population. Recent research conducted for the Delta Waterfowl Foundation suggests that hybrids are a result of forced copulations and not a normal pairing choice by black hens.|$|E

40|$|There is no {{question}} about it; rural population loss and Metropolitan concentration continue to be important factors in shaping social and economic conditions in much of America’s Great Plains region. Despite widespread population increases throughout much of nonmetropolitan America during the 1990 s, the rural Great Plains has remained an area of persistent decline (Johnson and Beale, 1998 and 2001). <b>Declining</b> <b>populations</b> have characterized many Great Plains counties since the early 1900 s, and the trend has continued with few exceptions through the most recent census in 2000. In fact, for some Great Plains counties, the rate of <b>population</b> <b>decline</b> has actually accelerated in recent years. <b>Declining</b> rural <b>populations</b> and low population densities have been themes of recurring interest for demographers, sociologists, economists, policy analysts and journalists. The causal sequence leading to the current state of decline in the rural Great Plains is broadly accepted. Changes in agricultural technology have led to increased farm size and, thus, the number of farms and related businesses. Declining farm numbers have led to <b>declining</b> farm <b>populations</b> and out-migration of young people. <b>Declining</b> <b>populations</b> and outmigration result in reduced demand for goods and services, diminished job opportunities, and still more out-migration. Since the propensity to migrate tends to decline with age, out-migration from rural areas is highest among the young. Out-migration of young people results in declining birth rates and a residual elderly population, both of which further contribute to <b>population</b> <b>decline</b> (Johansen, 1993; Coffman and Anthan, 2005) ...|$|R
