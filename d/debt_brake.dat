5000|$|Due to a debt-to-GDP ratio {{above the}} 60% {{threshold}} fixed in the Maastricht Treaty, caused {{primarily by the}} heavy payments to reconstruct former communist Eastern Germany after reunification, the German government decided to introduce {{a balanced budget amendment}} called [...] "debt brake" [...] (Schuldenbremse); in 2009 it was approved with a two-thirds majority both by the Bundestag and the Bundesrat. This decision will lead to public budgets without structural deficits (Länder) or a very limited deficit (0.35% of the GDP for the federal state). For the introduction of the Schuldenbremse or <b>debt</b> <b>brake</b> a constitutional change was necessary: The <b>debt</b> <b>brake</b> is now fixed in Article 109 paragraph 3 of the Basic Law, Germany's constitutional law. Meanwhile, several Länder also have adopted the <b>debt</b> <b>brake</b> in their state constitutions. With the <b>debt</b> <b>brake,</b> the structural federal deficit, and not the cyclical deficit, must not exceed 0.35% of the GDP starting 2016. For the Länder, structural deficits will be completely forbidden starting 2020. The only exceptions are natural disasters or strong recessions.|$|E
5000|$|The above {{outlined}} <b>debt</b> <b>brake</b> rule, already {{entered into}} {{force at the}} EU level on 13 December 2011, {{as part of the}} amendment of EU Regulation 1467/97 introduced by the sixpack reform. As it is also {{an essential part of the}} Fiscal Compact, the signatories are encouraged to refer to EU Regulation 1467/97 when they implement the rule into domestic law. For transitional reasons, the regulation granted all 23 EU Member States with an ongoing EDP in November 2011, a 3-year exemption period to comply with the rule, which will start in the year when the member state have its 2011-EDP abrogated. For example, Ireland will only be obliged to comply with the new <b>debt</b> <b>brake</b> rule in 2019, if they, as expected, manage to correct their EDP in fiscal year 2015 - with the formal EDP abrogation then taking place in 2016. During the years where the 23 member states are exempted from complying with the new <b>debt</b> <b>brake</b> rule, they are still obliged to comply with the old <b>debt</b> <b>brake</b> rule that requires the debt-to-GDP ratios in excess of 60% to be [...] "sufficiently diminished", meaning that it must approach the 60% reference value at a [...] "satisfactory pace" [...] ensuring it will succeed to meet the debt reduction requirement of the new <b>debt</b> <b>brake</b> rule three years after its EDP is abrogated. This special transitional [...] "satisfactory pace" [...] is calculated by the Commission individually for each of the concerned states, and is published to them in form of a figure for: The annually required Minimum Linear Structural Adjustment (MLSA) of the deficit in each of the 3 years in the transition period - ensuring the compliance with the new <b>debt</b> <b>brake</b> rule by the end of the transition period.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{development}} of budget expenditures in the 1990‘s, the Swiss parliament and subsequently the people, voted in favor of a new fiscal instrument to reduce government debt in 2001. The so-called <b>debt</b> <b>brake</b> was enacted in 2003 and reinforced the constitutional principle that expenditures have to be mainly financed by revenues and not through an increase in public debt. The mechanism of the <b>debt</b> <b>brake</b> works in a way that introduces a ceiling on spending that is being calculated on a yearly basis. There are adjustment punishments for exceeded budgets, which in turn will force public debt down in following years. Importantly all sorts of government expenditures are equally covered by the <b>debt</b> <b>brake.</b> The only exception to this rule are extraordinary spendings that have to be approved by both chambers of parliament. This exception is supposed to allow the government to react to emergency situations such as for example disaster relieve or the 2008 UBS bailout.|$|E

40|$|European {{debates over}} {{reform of the}} fiscal {{governance}} of the euro area frequently reference fiscal federalism in the United States. The "fiscal compact" agreed by the European Council during 2011 provided for the introduction of, among other things, constitutional rules or framework laws known as "debt brakes" in the member states of the euro area. In light of the compact and proposals for deeper fiscal union, we review US fiscal federalism from Alexander Hamilton to the present. We note that within the US system the states are "sovereign": The federal government does not mandate balanced budgets nor, since the 1840 s, does it bail out states in fiscal trouble. States adopted balanced budget rules of varying strength {{during the nineteenth century}} and these rules limit debt accumulation. Before introducing <b>debt</b> <b>brakes</b> for euro area member states, however, Europeans should consider three important caveats. First, <b>debt</b> <b>brakes</b> {{are likely to be more}} durable and effective when "owned" locally rather than mandated centrally. Second, maintaining a capacity for countercyclical macroeconomic stabilization is essential. Balanced budget rules have been viable in the US states because the federal government has a broad set of fiscal powers, including countercyclical fiscal action. Finally, because <b>debt</b> <b>brakes</b> threaten to collide with bank rescues, the euro area should unify bank regulation and create a common fiscal pool for restructuring the banking system. fiscal federalism, balanced budget rules, US financial history, state debt, euro crisis, fiscal compact...|$|R

5000|$|After {{years of}} rising deficits and debt in the 1990s, Switzerland's {{citizens}} adopted the <b>debt</b> <b>brake</b> as {{a constitutional amendment}} in 2001. The rule was implemented starting in 2003. It states that each year, the budget must be in balance, adjusted for economic conditions. This adjustment is made by multiplying expenditures by a cyclical factor (the ratio of trend real GDP to expected real GDP), thus either allowing for deficits during recessions or forcing lawmakers to have surpluses during booms. Essentially, the rule calls for structural balance in each year and absolute balance {{over the course of}} a business cycle. So if lawmakers want to have expansionary fiscal policy during recessions, they need to pay for it by saving up during good economic times. The rule did initially allow for [...] "extraordinary spending" [...] if a qualified parliamentary majority approved, but recent changes have made this spending count as normal expenditures.|$|E

40|$|The global {{economic}} crisis {{has not been}} overcome; its character has merely changed. For us parliamentarians, its most tangible characteristic is the smoldering debt crisis in some Euro countries. Similar to {{the crisis in the}} banking sector, the European government debt crisis is typical of a large-scale financial crisis, the “Second Great Depression, ” and managing it has to be addressed in this context. If it were only an uncontrolled government debt accumulation in Europe, then it would now be appropriate to simply apply <b>debt</b> <b>brakes</b> to manage the public debt, and to work with stronger sanction options. But would this have prevented the problems in Ireland or Spain? No. The financial crises in Spain and Ireland have {{absolutely nothing to do with}} government irresponsibly incurring debt. The government debt only increased when the government had to react to the excessive indebtedness of the private households and banks that it had previously permitted. The conservative reinterpretation of the debt crisis as a purely governmental debt crisis due to excessive government spending is politically smart but factually incorrect. Drastic austerity programs alone are therefore not very useful in overcoming the crisis. On the contrary, the current crisis policy aggravates the crisis in many areas. Moreover, we should not forget that we have barely made any progress in coping with the crises of poverty and distribution, or in the crises involving the climate and resources. Climate change has largely disappeared from the headlines, and, in terms of concrete government action, the brakes are being applied to many climate policy questions.

40|$|Starting in 2011, Germany {{will have}} a new fiscal rule to limit {{indebtedness}} - the <b>debt</b> <b>brake.</b> To encourage the functioning of this regulation on federal and Länder level, an advice board (Stabilitätsrat) was founded in April 2010. In a first step he selected four key numbers and defined thresholds. This article focuses on the chosen indicators and thresholds on Länder level by evaluating the effectiveness of both, the key figures themselves and their thresholds. We are analyzing time series from 1995 to 2009. The findings show that in general, the chosen figures are able to indicate a possible debt risk. However, the threshold values of the advice board endanger the effectiveness of the <b>debt</b> <b>brake.</b> This danger is especially caused by the mode of calculation: The thresholds are based on an average of German Länder. For this reason, only extremely negative household developments are pointed out. Furthermore, the new German <b>debt</b> <b>brake</b> is fundamentally based on the structural budget balance. Nevertheless, this key figure has not directly been chosen by the board.

This circumstance is precarious, because the <b>debt</b> <b>brake</b> cannot step really into force without the calculation of the structural budget balance for the Länder. For this reason, we try to close this vacancy by proposing a possible calculating mode for the structural part of the budget.

However, it is essential to design the <b>debt</b> <b>brake</b> such that lapses in the spending scheme due to estimation errors in trend output or discretionary fiscal policy actions are booked on an adjustment account and cut future government spending, where discretionary lapses should be corrected faster than lapses due to estimation errors...|$|E
40|$|The Swiss <b>debt</b> <b>brake</b> {{is widely}} {{appreciated}} {{as one of}} the most rationally designed fiscal rules in the world and was thus also discussed as blueprint in the debates about fiscal rules in Germany, the European Union member states and Israel. However, evidence that this rule really contributes to sound federal finances does not exist yet. We investigate the effectiveness of the Swiss <b>debt</b> <b>brake</b> by employing the Synthetic Control Method. We find that the introduction of this fiscal rule improved the budget balance by about 3. 6 percentage points on average in a post-intervention period covering five years...|$|E
40|$|The European Union’s {{regulations}} governing {{sovereign debt}} {{are based on}} the principle of equal treatment of all member states. The recommendations we make here concerning changes in European Union sovereign-debt reduction rules take account of national particularities, but are by no means arbitrary in nature. According to the calculations we present here, such reformed regulations would do far more to promote economic growth than would be the case under the Fiscal Compact’s European <b>debt</b> <b>brake.</b> By 2030, real gains in growth will amount to more than 450 billion euros more than the outcome that would presumably be obtained under the European <b>debt</b> <b>brake...</b>|$|E
40|$|Debt-to-GDP ratios {{have grown}} to {{unprecedented}} levels in many industrialized economies. This requires disciplined consolidation efforts which are, however, supposed to come now {{at the wrong time}} with the economic recovery being fragile. The countries forming the G 20 need to make sure the long-term sustainability of public finances. Not least, this is indispensable in order to avoid a further spreading of the sovereign debt crisis. Against this background, we call for a global <b>debt</b> <b>brake</b> following the Swiss or German example which should be agreed upon in Cannes in early November 2011. The agreement on the <b>debt</b> <b>brake</b> should be binding – in contrast to previous expressions made at the G 20 -level to reduce government debt, as, for example, the Seoul Action Plan is lacking any binding character. Therefore, the debt brakes should be fixed in national constitutions and monitored by independent transnational fiscal councils. The fiscal councils could be located at the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and should conduct a regular evaluation of national budget plans {{in order to ensure that}} they meet the requirements stipulated by the <b>debt</b> <b>brake.</b> Through this global monitoring process, an early warning system could be developed with the aim to avoid sovereign debt crises and the resulting contagion risks among highly indebted countries in the future. In an economic and political environment which is characterized by large uncertainties concerning economic prospects and the fear of a potential spreading of the sovereign debt crisis, a global <b>debt</b> <b>brake</b> in combination with an independent transnational supervisory council would send a credible signal that a reduction of sovereign debt to sustainable levels is not further delayed into the future. Moreover, a well-designed <b>debt</b> <b>brake</b> ensures that the general government budget is balanced over the business cycle. Consequently, it is a more efficient instrument than the former Stability and Growth Pact for the Eurozone which in fact stipulated a ceiling for the budget deficit, but whose requirements regarding budget surpluses in good times were insufficient. This asymmetry is eliminated by those debt brakes which are in force in Switzerland and Germany. The new fiscal policy framework thus leaves enough room for discretionary fiscal policy and the workings of automatic stabilizers in an economic downturn. <b>debt</b> <b>brake,</b> fiscal council, G 20...|$|E
40|$|After {{a decade}} with large budget deficits, Switzerland {{introduced}} a <b>debt</b> <b>brake</b> in 2002. It is an expenditure rule with sets {{a limit on}} expenditure both during boom and during recession periods and applies to the federal budget and account. Judging from simulations using historical data, the mechanism works more or less as intended. There is a sanction mechanism present since deviations from the expenditure limit have to be corrected in the future. Short-term fixes are excluded to some degree since extraordinary revenue {{is not included in}} the mechanism. However, the <b>debt</b> <b>brake</b> has a number of weak spots which could lead to a failure to achieve the target of balanced accounts.
