40|$|Rock {{grouting}} is {{a commonly}} used process for sealing rocks in tunnels to reduce water ingress. In {{order to achieve}} sufficient sealing level the grout must effectively penetrate into rock fractures while the limiting factor is filtration of cement based grout. Many devices and measuring methods {{have been developed to}} study filtration and to measure the penetrability. The <b>filter</b> <b>pump</b> and the penetrability meter are two of the most commonly used instruments for measuring filtration tendency in the field and in the lab, while short slot is used mainly in the lab. The results obtained from these devices have relatively different estimations of the penetrability partly due to the weaknesses in measuring methods and test procedures. Furthermore, there are no clear criteria to find out which of the results are closer to the reality or how much the results differ among these instruments. The aim of this study is comparing, and evaluating the results of these devices in relatively similar conditions while using more accurate methods of weight-time and pressure-time compared to the less reliable total volume method. The <b>filter</b> <b>pump</b> and the penetrability meter were modified In order to fulfill the requirement of testing in similar conditions and to improve their accuracy and versatility. The results show that increasing the pressure improves the penetrability significantly. The modification of the <b>filter</b> <b>pump</b> results in reducing many uncertainties related to the testing procedure. Probably the modified <b>filter</b> <b>pump</b> has higher accuracy in measuring the penetrability compared to regular <b>filter</b> <b>pump.</b> The short slot has the highest accuracy in estimating penetrability of cement based grout especially at higher pressures, furthermore, the short slot provides a more flexible way to measure penetrability with different pressures in the range of 1 - 15 bars...|$|R

40|$|The aims of {{this paper}} were to {{investigate}} how <b>glass</b> <b>filtered</b> UV irradiances vary with glass thickness, lamination of the glass {{and the effect of}} SZA, and to measure the <b>glass</b> <b>filtered</b> UV exposures to different receiving planes with a newly developed UVA dosimeter. Spectroradiometric and dosimetric techniques were employed in the experimental approach. The percentage of the <b>glass</b> <b>filtered</b> solar UV compared to the unfiltered UV ranged from 59 % to 70 % and was influenced to a small extent by the glass thickness and the solar zenith angle (SZA). The laminated glass transmitted 11 to 12 % and the windscreen glass transmitted 2. 5 to 2. 6 %. The influence of the SZA was less for the thicker glass than it was for the thinner glass. The change in transmission was less than 14 % for the SZA between 48 ° and 71 °. There was negligible influence due to the SZA on the glass transmitted UV of the laminated and windscreen glass. The influence of the glass thickness in the range of 2 mm to 6 mm on the percentage transmission was less than 16 %. The influences of the glass thickness and the SZA on the glass transmitted UV have been incorporated in the use of a UVA dosimeter for the glass transmitted UV exposures. The UVA dosimeter was employed in the field to measure the <b>glass</b> <b>filtered</b> UV exposures to different receiving planes. The UVA dosimeter reported has the potential for personal solar UVA exposure measurements...|$|R
