5|$|The {{shape of}} the nasal {{chambers}} of Ankylosaurus indicate that airflow was unidirectional, (looping through the lungs during inhalation and <b>exhalation),</b> although it {{may also have been}} bidirectional in the posterior nasal chamber, which directed air past the olfactory lobes. The enlarged olfactory region of ankylosaurids indicates a well-developed sense of smell, and the position of the orbits of Ankylosaurus suggest some stereoscopic vision.|$|E
5|$|Whales are {{air-breathing}} mammals {{who must}} surface {{to get the}} air they need.

5|$|When one inhales or exhales, {{according}} to verses 4.47–65, the Nadis {{are loaded with}} vital airs. There are ten types of vital airs, corresponding to different stages of breathing, and they are named Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana, Vyana, Naga, Kurma, Krikara, Devadatta and Dhananjaya. These affect the Nadis in different ways, and how the body functions and what the balance of organs within the body is, depends on food one takes in and how well inhalation and <b>exhalation</b> are able to deliver the vital airs to various body parts.|$|E
40|$|Water {{contains}} {{dissolved oxygen}} that a fish needs to breathe. It {{is important to}} increase the amounts of separation of dissolved oxygen from water for diverse applications using the separation system. In this paper, a separation system of dissolved gases from water concurrently variable mixed with the <b>exhalations</b> using a compressor is proposed. This system takes use of <b>exhalations</b> to increase the amounts of separation of dissolved oxygen from water. A compressor with variable off-time and on-time is used to control the <b>exhalations</b> mixed with inlet water. <b>Exhalations</b> contain some portion of carbon dioxide, oxygen, and nitrogen. Separation of dissolved gases containing dissolved oxygen is enhanced by using <b>exhalations.</b> The amounts of separation and the compositions {{of carbon dioxide and}} oxygen are measured. Higher amounts of separation can make the size of the separation device smaller, and then, application areas are diversified...|$|R

40|$|In {{the region}} of Scuol-Tarasp in the Lower Engadine Valley in the Eastern Swiss Alps, {{there are a variety}} of {{phenomena}} related to a geogenetic CO 2 production, including carbogaseous mineral springs, previously active coldwater geysers and dry gas <b>exhalations</b> from the ground via mofettes. Previous isotopic studies revealed that the CO 2 originates from the metamorphic decomposition of carbonate rocks in the crust. This paper presents an inventory of the springs, geysers and mofettes, and proposes a conceptual model on the regional gas and water circulation. Based on hydrochemical criteria, it was possible to identify six main groups of spring waters, three of which are carbogaseous mineral springs. Most of the carbogaseous springs and gas <b>exhalations</b> are bound to the Bündnerschiefer fractured aquifer. The different water types originate from mixing of groundwater and highly mineralised carbogaseous fluids from depth. Near-surface degassing of CO 2 from the fluid phase creates the dry gas <b>exhalations.</b> CO 2 and radon measurements in 178 soil boreholes suggest that the gas <b>exhalations</b> occur at a limited number of point-like anomalies, and there is no evidence for regionally important diffuse CO 2 discharges from the ground...|$|R
5|$|Hydrothermal {{alteration}} {{of the central}} lava dome and iron-bearing deposits has generated alunite, anatase, chlorite, copper veinlets, gypsum, illite, jarosite, labradorite, quartz, rutile, sanidine, smectite, and sulfur. Some of these minerals forms veins inside the rock. Silification is prominent and has formed cristobalite and tridymite. Elemental sulfur is also found. Vast regions of the volcano have been altered hydrothermally at temperatures of , giving the rock a clear appearance. Minor <b>exhalation</b> deposits are {{also found in the}} form of sulfates that sometimes conserve conduits. Red-coloured alteration halos occur in andesites adjacent to iron deposits, probably due to iron input.|$|E
5|$|Sitting in Padmasana (lotus) posture, {{the text}} {{states that the}} pranayama or {{breathing}} must be gradual, both inhalation, holding and <b>exhalation</b> should be slow, steady and deep. The text introduces a series of time measures (matras, musical beats) to aid self monitoring and to measure progress, wherein the beat is created by the yoga student with fingers self circumambulating and using one's own knee for the beat pulse. A sequential gradual inhalation over sixteen Matras (digits), holding the air deep within for sixty-four Matras and gradually exhaling the air over thirty-two Matras is suggested as {{the goal of the}} breathing exercise.|$|E
5|$|Yajnavalkya dedicates {{significant}} amount of text to explain the art of mastering each stage of breathing, that is inhalation, <b>exhalation</b> and stoppage between the two. Each stage is {{discussed in terms of}} its nature, speed, duration, depth on its own and relative to the other stage of breathing, regulating these at will during asanas meant for cleansing body or mind. In order to keep time for each stage without distraction, he recommends silently reciting time-measured mantras or sound beats to help measure each stage and thus establish progress during the yoga. The mantras for internal time measurement mentioned include Pranava (Om), Gayatri with Vyahritis, or Gayatri with Siras.|$|E

5|$|Birds {{have one}} of the most complex {{respiratory}} systems of all animal groups. Upon inhalation, 75% of the fresh air bypasses the lungs and flows directly into a posterior air sac which extends from the lungs and connects with air spaces in the bones and fills them with air. The other 25% of the air goes directly into the lungs. When the bird exhales, the used air flows out of the lungs and the stored fresh air from the posterior air sac is simultaneously forced into the lungs. Thus, a bird's lungs receive a constant supply of fresh air during both inhalation and <b>exhalation.</b> Sound production is achieved using the syrinx, a muscular chamber incorporating multiple tympanic membranes which diverges from {{the lower end of the}} trachea; the trachea being elongated in some species, increasing the volume of vocalisations and the perception of the bird's size.|$|E
5|$|No single {{method for}} {{confirming}} tracheal tube placement {{has been shown}} to be 100% reliable. Accordingly, the use of multiple methods for confirmation of correct tube placement is now widely considered to be the standard of care. Such methods include direct visualization as the tip of the tube passes through the glottis, or indirect visualization of the tracheal tube within the trachea using a device such as a bronchoscope. With a properly positioned tracheal tube, equal bilateral breath sounds will be heard upon listening to the chest with a stethoscope, and no sound upon listening to the area over the stomach. Equal bilateral rise and fall of the chest wall will be evident with ventilatory excursions. A small amount of water vapor will also be evident within the lumen of the tube with each <b>exhalation</b> and there will be no gastric contents in the tracheal tube at any time.|$|E
25|$|After {{a desired}} posture has been achieved, verses II.49 through II.51 {{recommend}} the next limb of yoga, prāṇāyāma, {{which is the}} practice of consciously regulating breath (inhalation and <b>exhalation).</b> This is done in several ways, inhaling and then suspending <b>exhalation</b> for a period, exhaling and then suspending inhalation for a period, slowing the inhalation and <b>exhalation,</b> consciously changing the time/length of breath (deep, short breathing).|$|E
