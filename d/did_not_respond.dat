5|$|Meanwhile, Records {{found that}} the plane <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> to his control column. Even with the control column turned {{all the way to}} the left, {{commanding}} maximum left aileron, and pulled all the way back, commanding maximum up elevatorinputs that would never be used together in normal flight, commanding a roll to the left and the aircraft's nose to risethe aircraft was instead banking to the right with the nose dropping. Haynes attempted to level the aircraft with his own control column, then both Haynes and Records tried using their control columns together, but the aircraft still <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond.</b> Afraid the aircraft would roll into a completely inverted position (an unrecoverable situation), the crew reduced the left wingmounted engine to idle and applied maximum power to the right engine. This caused the airplane to slowly level out.|$|E
5|$|Murray <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> {{directly}} to the criticisms of her work, but reacted to her critics in a hostile manner; in later life she asserted that she eventually ceased reading reviews of her work, and believed that her critics were simply acting {{out of their own}} Christian prejudices to non-Christian religion.|$|E

5|$|On February 1, 1894, {{the mine}} owners began {{implementing}} the 10-hour day. Union president John Calderwood issued a notice {{a week later}} demanding that the mine owners reinstate the eight-hour day at the $3.00 wage. When the owners <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond,</b> the nascent union struck on February 7. Portland, Pikes Peak, Gold Dollar and a few smaller mines immediately agreed to the eight-hour day and remained open, but larger mines held out.|$|E
5|$|After Reagan's {{military}} buildup, the Soviet Union <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> {{by further}} building its military because the enormous military expenses, along with inefficient planned manufacturing and collectivized agriculture, were already {{a heavy burden}} for the Soviet economy. At the same time, Saudi Arabia increased oil production, even as other non-OPEC nations were increasing production. These developments contributed to the 1980s oil glut, which affected the Soviet Union, as oil was {{the main source of}} Soviet export revenues. Issues with command economics, oil price decreases and large military expenditures gradually brought the Soviet economy to stagnation.|$|E
5|$|Home was {{generally}} warmly regarded by colleagues and opponents alike, {{and there were}} few politicians who <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> well to him. One was Attlee, but as their political primes did not overlap this was of minor consequence. More important was Iain Macleod's prickly relationship with Home. Macleod, Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1959–61, was, like Butler, on the liberal wing of the Conservative party; he was convinced, as Home was not, that Britain's colonies in Africa should have majority rule and independence as quickly as possible. Their spheres of influence overlapped in the Central African Federation.|$|E

5|$|In early 1801, Adams {{had sent}} Thomas Jefferson a brief note after {{returning}} to Quincy to which Jefferson <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond.</b> In 1804, Abigail wrote to Jefferson to express her condolences upon {{the death of his}} daughter Polly, who had stayed with the Adamses is London in 1787. This initiated a brief correspondence which quickly descended into political rancor. Jefferson terminated it by not replying to Abigail's fourth letter. Aside from that, there had been no communication between Peacefield and Monticello since Adams left office.|$|E
5|$|No {{blood was}} shed during the event, {{and when the}} Gabonese people <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> violently the {{military}} interpreted this {{as a sign of}} approval. Aubame was offered the presidency of the newly formed provisional government. The government was composed of civilian politicians from both the UDSG and BDG, such as Gondjout. During the coup, he served as Minister of State. The coup's leaders were content at restoring security for the civilians. The small Gabonese army did not intervene; composed mostly of French officers, they remained in their barracks.|$|E
5|$|UNITA forces {{attacked}} Camabatela in Cuanza Norte province on 8 February 1986. ANGOP alleged UNITA massacred {{civilians in}} Damba in Uíge Province later that month, on 26 February. The South African government agreed to Crocker's terms in principle on 8 March. Savimbi proposed a truce regarding the Benguela railway on 26 March, saying MPLA trains could pass through {{as long as}} an international inspection group monitored trains to prevent their use for counter-insurgency activity. The government <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond.</b> In April 1987, Fidel Castro sent Cuba's Fiftieth Brigade to southern Angola, {{increasing the number of}} Cuban troops from 12,000 to 15,000. The MPLA and American governments began negotiating in June 1987.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{patients}} show no emotional {{reaction to}} humor, whether produced by themselves or others. This lack of responsiveness {{is due to}} dissociation between their cognitive and affective responses to humorous stimuli. That is, even when a patient understands that a joke is funny (based on quantitative brain activity), they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> with laughter, or even a smile. While they have grasped the cognitive basis of humor, they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> affectively <b>respond.</b> This also considered a cognitive component of empathy, affecting ability to take the perspective of others; hence why patients often <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> to humor produced by other people.|$|R

There is no cure, but many patients live to adulthood. Several new experimental treatments may alleviate symptoms.|$|R
50|$|Later, {{many other}} cells with {{specific}} functions have been discovered: (a) end-stopped cells which {{are thought to}} detect singularities like line and edge crossings, vertices and line endings; (b) bar and grating cells. The latter are not linear operators because a bar cell <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> when seeing a bar {{which is part of}} a periodic grating, and a grating cell <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> when seeing an isolated bar.|$|R
5|$|Watched by a {{crowd of}} 17,042, CSKA {{took the lead in}} the first half when Daniel Carvalho scored.

The score remained 1–1 {{until the end of the}} 90 minutes to send the match into extra-time. Cissé scored again in the 103rd minute to give Liverpool the lead, which was later extended by Luis García. Liverpool held out until the end of extra-time to win the match 3–1, their third Super Cup win.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{two leaders}} had a strong relationship, by 1960 US {{officials}} were becoming concerned by what they viewed as Canadian procrastination on vital issues, such as whether Canada should join the Organization of American States (OAS). Talks on these issues in June 1960 produced little in results. Diefenbaker hoped that US Vice President Richard Nixon would win the 1960 US presidential election, but when Nixon's Democratic rival, Senator John F. Kennedy won the race, he sent Senator Kennedy a note of congratulations. Kennedy <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> until Canadian officials asked {{what had become of}} Diefenbaker's note, two weeks later. Diefenbaker, for whom such correspondence was very meaningful, was annoyed at the President-elect's slowness to respond. In January 1961, Diefenbaker visited Washington to sign the Columbia River Treaty. However, with only days remaining in the Eisenhower administration, little else could be accomplished.|$|E
5|$|At {{about this}} time, Yūnagi {{detached}} from the Japanese column and reversed direction, perhaps because she {{lost sight of the}} other Japanese ships ahead of her, or perhaps she was ordered to provide a rearguard for Mikawa's force. One minute later, Japanese lookouts sighted a warship to port. This ship was the destroyer , heavily damaged the day before and now departing Guadalcanal independently for repairs in Australia. Whether Jarvis sighted the Japanese ships is unknown, since her radios had been destroyed. Furutaka launched torpedoes at Jarvis, which all missed. The Japanese ships passed as close to Jarvis as 1,100 meters, close enough for officers on Tenryū to look down onto the destroyer's decks without seeing any of her crew moving about. If Jarvis was aware of the Japanese ships passing by, she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> in any noticeable way.|$|E

5|$|Cobain and Novoselic {{met while}} {{attending}} Aberdeen High, although they never connected, according to Cobain. The pair eventually became friends while frequenting the practice {{space of the}} Melvins. Cobain wanted to form a band with Novoselic, but Novoselic <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> {{for a long period}} of time. In persuading Novoselic to form a band, Cobain gave him a demo tape of his project Fecal Matter. Three years after the two first met, Novoselic notified Cobain that he had finally listened to the Fecal Matter demo and suggested they start a group. The pair recruited Bob McFadden on drums, but after a month the project fell apart. In early 1987, Cobain and Novoselic recruited drummer Aaron Burckhard. The three practiced material from Cobain's Fecal Matter tape but started writing new material soon after forming.|$|E
5|$|Hoste also {{remained}} at sea, cruising in the battered Amphion beyond {{the range of}} the shore batteries on Lesina. Hoste was furious at the behaviour of Flore's officers and sent a note into Lesina demanding that they give up the ship as indicated by its earlier surrender. In surrendering and then escaping, the officers of Flore had breached an informal rule of naval conflict under which a ship that voluntarily struck its flag submitted to an opponent in order to prevent continued loss of life among its crew. Flore had been able to pass unmolested through the British squadron only because she was recognised to have surrendered, and to abuse this custom in this way was considered, in the Royal Navy especially, to be a dishonourable act. The French at Lesina <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond</b> to Hoste's note, and the British squadron was eventually forced to return to Lissa to effect repairs.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{problems with the}} terminal building, both the airport's location and surrounding infrastructure were {{the subject of much}} complaint as well. For one, although some 1,700 cars visited the airport daily, the parking lot had only 129 slots, and could not be expanded any further. The airport complex likewise was located directly alongside major city thoroughfares, in particular the city's main highway, the Tomas Confesor Highway, which complicated the flow of traffic in and around the area. At one point, the ATO, which was already having difficulty managing vehicular traffic around the airport, proposed banning cargo and delivery trucks from passing through the road in front of the terminal building. However, the city government <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>respond.</b>|$|E
