5|$|The program's {{scheduled}} broadcast {{time was}} 21:00, but the channel often delayed its broadcast {{by up to}} 40 minutes. This led to conflicts with other channels and COMFER, the institution that regulates Argentine television.

5|$|In late November 1918 the 4th Division began a road {{march of}} more than 125 miles from the French city of Metz toward the German city of Koblenz, on the Rhine River. The final {{destination}} of Middleton's 47th Regiment would be the town of Adenau, 35 miles due west of Koblenz. The road trip took fifteen days of moving through almost incessant rain and ended in a driving snowstorm on 15 December. During the march, Middleton broke character and rode a horse during most of each day, surveying his troops and occasionally dismounting to talk with them. The formation marched for fifty minutes of each hour, and rested for ten, with a <b>full</b> <b>hour</b> for lunch.|$|E
5|$|At {{first he}} took soft clay in his bill {{from the edge}} of the water and seemed to be {{smearing}} it on one leg near the knee. Then he fluttered away on one foot for a short distance and seemed to be pulling tiny roots and fibers of grass, which he worked into the clay that he had already smeared on his leg. Again he took some clay and plastered it over the fibers, putting on more and more till I could plainly see the enlargement, working away with strange, silent intentness for fully fifteen minutes, while I watched and wondered, scarce believing my eyes. Then he stood perfectly still for a <b>full</b> <b>hour</b> under an overhanging sod, where the eye could with difficulty find him, his only motion meanwhile being an occasional rubbing and smoothing of the clay bandage with his bill, until it hardened enough to suit him, whereupon he fluttered away from the brook and disappeared in the thick woods.|$|E

5|$|When {{the great}} bell rings out every <b>full</b> <b>hour,</b> {{struck by a}} large clockwork-operated hammer, passers-by see a gilded figure in full harness moving its arm to strike it. The larger-than-life figure of bearded Chronos, the Greek {{personification}} of time, is traditionally nicknamed Hans von Thann by the Bernese. The wooden bell-striker, which has been replaced several times, has been a fixture of the Zytglogge since the renewal of the astronomical clock in 1530, whose clockwork also controls the figure's motions. The original wooden Chronos might have been created by master craftsman Albrecht von Nürnberg, while the current and most recent Hans is a 1930 reconstruction of a Baroque original. The bell-striker has been gilded, just like the bells, since 1770.|$|E

In 1993, she began a weekly half-hour service program based on her magazine, which expanded to weekdays in 1997 and later to a <b>full</b> <b>hour</b> show in 1999, with half-hour episodes on weekends. Stewart also became a frequent contributor to NBC's Today Show and later to CBS's The Early Show, and starred in several prime time holiday specials on the CBS network.|$|E

Then, Halsey ordered Task Force 34 south. As Task Force 34 proceeded south they were further delayed when the battle force had to slow to 12 knots so that the battleships could refuel their escorting destroyers. The refueling cost a {{two and a half}} hour further delay. By the time Task Force 34 arrived at the scene {{it was too late to}} assist the Seventh Fleet's escort carrier groups. Kurita had already decided to retire and had left the area. A single straggling destroyer was caught by Halsey's advance cruisers and destroyers, but the rest of Kurita's force was able to escape.|$|E
25|$|Family Feud {{moved to}} CBS with Combs hosting on July 4, 1988, {{replacing}} The $25,000 Pyramid. Like its predecessor, this version {{also had an}} accompanying syndicated edition which launched in September of that year. In June 1992, the network version expanded from its original half-hour format to a <b>full</b> <b>hour,</b> and was retitled The Family Feud Challenge; this new format featured three families per episode, which included two new families competing in the first half-hour {{for the right to}} play the returning champions in the second half. The Family Feud Challenge aired its final new episode on March 26, 1993, with reruns airing until September 10. The syndicated Feud, meanwhile, remained in production and entered its sixth season in the fall of 1993.|$|E
25|$|By 1971, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) {{introduced}} the Prime Time Access Rule, which freed local network affiliates {{in the top}} 50 markets (in practice, the entire network) to take a half-hour of prime time from the networks on Mondays through Saturdays and one <b>full</b> <b>hour</b> on Sundays. Because nearly all affiliates found production costs for the FCC's intended goal of increased public affairs programming very high and the ratings (and by association, advertising revenues) low, making it mostly unprofitable, the FCC created an exception for network-authored news and public affairs shows. After a six-month hiatus in late 1971, CBS found a prime place for 60 Minutes in a portion of that displaced time, 6:00 to 7:00p.m. (Eastern; 5:00 to 6:00 Central Time) on Sundays, in January 1972.|$|E

25|$|With the July move, {{many of the}} {{previously}} devoted viewers began abandoning the program. Jeopardy! became the seventh show since 1968 to fail at 1:30p.m. EST (12:30p.m. CST), and a cancellation notice was issued by November 1974. Its replacement was the expansion of Another World to a <b>full</b> <b>hour,</b> the first daytime serial to expand to that duration; in April 1975, another serial, Days of Our Lives began occupying that time slot and eventually brought success to NBC there. Jeopardy! broadcast the 2,753rd and final episode of its original network run on January 3, 1975. Some affiliates, including KNBC in Los Angeles, aired reruns in various other time slots through {{the first quarter of}} that year. To compensate Griffin for canceling the program, which still had a year left on its contract, NBC purchased Wheel of Fortune, another creation of his, which premiered on January 6, 1975 at 10:30a.m. Eastern (9:30 Central).|$|E
25|$|All My Children (often {{shortened}} to AMC) is an American television {{soap opera}} that aired on ABC for 41 years, from January 5, 1970, to September 23, 2011, and on The Online Network (TOLN) from April 29 to September 2, 2013, via Hulu, Hulu Plus, and iTunes. Created by Agnes Nixon, All My Children {{is set in}} Pine Valley, Pennsylvania, a fictional suburb of Philadelphia, which is modeled on the actual Philadelphia suburb of Rosemont. The original series featured Susan Lucci as Erica Kane, one of daytime television's most popular characters. The title of the series refers to the bonds of humanity. All My Children was the first new network daytime drama to debut in the 1970s. Originally owned by Creative Horizons, Inc., the company created by Nixon and her husband, Bob, the show was sold to ABC in January 1975. The series started at a half-hour in per-installment length, then was expanded to a <b>full</b> <b>hour</b> on April 25, 1977. Earlier, the show had experimented with the full-hour format for one week starting on June 30, 1975, after which Ryan's Hope premiered.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s, General Hospital earned decent ratings {{against the}} likes of To Tell the Truth and The Secret Storm on CBS, {{but there was a}} decline as the 1970s came, {{especially}} when NBC's Another World became highly popular. For two years, it also faced CBS' The Price Is Right, already a major hit. After continued mediocrity in the Nielsen ratings, ABC was prepared to cancel General Hospital, but decided to give it a second chance in 1977 when it expanded the show to a <b>full</b> <b>hour,</b> from an experimental 45 minutes. However, the expansion came with an ultimatum to the producers that they had six months to improve the show's ratings. Gloria Monty was hired as the new executive producer, and on her first day, she spent an extra $100,000 re-taping four episodes. A miracle occurred thanks to Monty and head writer Douglas Marland; the show became the most watched daytime drama by 1979, marking a rare instance of a daytime serial's comeback from near-extinction. During the wedding of Luke and Laura Spencer on November 17, 1981, about 30 million people tuned in to watch them exchange vows and be cursed by Elizabeth Taylor's Helena Cassadine (later played by Constance Towers).|$|E

500|$|The Bernese German Zytglogge {{translates}} to Zeitglocke in Standard German and to time bell in English; 'Glocke' means 'bell' in German, {{as in the}} related term 'glockenspiel'. A [...] "time bell" [...] {{was one of the}} earliest public timekeeping devices, consisting of a clockwork connected to a hammer that rang a small bell at the <b>full</b> <b>hour.</b> Such a device was installed in the Wendelstein in Bern – the tower of the Leutkirche church which the Münster later replaced – in 1383 at the latest; it alerted the bell-ringer to ring the tower bells.|$|E
500|$|Around eleven, {{the five}} {{warships}} began a salvo of broadside fire that flattened the flimsy American breastworks and panicked the Connecticut militia. [...] "So terrible and so incessant a roar of guns few {{even in the}} army and navy had ever heard before," [...] wrote Ambrose Serle, private secretary to Lord Howe. Nearly eighty guns fired at the shore for a <b>full</b> <b>hour.</b> The Americans were half buried under dirt and sand, and were unable to return fire due to the smoke and dust. After the guns ceased, the British flatboats appeared out of the smoke and headed for shore. By then the Americans were in a panicked retreat, and the British began their amphibious landing.|$|E

But the tide was out. It was three <b>full</b> <b>hours</b> before the ship could float; and for three <b>full</b> <b>hours</b> they waited in fear and trembling, expecting the Cornishmen to be down upon them in a body every moment, under which wholesome fear some on board prayed fervently who had never been known to pray before.|$|R
