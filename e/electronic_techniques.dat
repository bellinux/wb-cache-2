25|$|Pietro Grossi was an Italian {{pioneer of}} {{computer}} composition and tape music, who first experimented with <b>electronic</b> <b>techniques</b> {{in the early}} sixties. Grossi was a cellist and composer, born in Venice in 1917. He founded the S 2F M (Studio de Fonologia Musicale di Firenze) in 1963 in order to experiment with electronic sound and composition.|$|E
25|$|To {{make the}} {{transition}} between drivers as seamless as possible, system designers have attempted to time-align (or phase adjust) the drivers by moving one or more driver mounting locations forward or back so that the acoustic center of each driver {{is in the same}} vertical plane. This may also involve tilting the face speaker back, providing a separate enclosure mounting for each driver, or (less commonly) using <b>electronic</b> <b>techniques</b> to achieve the same effect. These attempts have resulted in some unusual cabinet designs.|$|E
25|$|Driver design—including the {{particular}} way {{two or more}} drivers are combined in an enclosure to make a speaker system—is both an art, involving subjective perceptions of timbre and sound quality and a science, involving measurements and experiments. Adjusting a design to improve performance is done {{using a combination of}} magnetic, acoustic, mechanical, electrical, and material science theory, and tracked with high precision measurements and the observations of experienced listeners. A few of the issues speaker and driver designers must confront are distortion, radiation lobing, phase effects, off-axis response, and crossover artifacts. Designers can use an anechoic chamber to ensure the speaker can be measured independently of room effects, or any of several <b>electronic</b> <b>techniques</b> that, to some extent, substitute for such chambers. Some developers eschew anechoic chambers in favor of specific standardized room setups intended to simulate real-life listening conditions.|$|E

500|$|This was {{the first}} time-to-amplitude converter, another of Rossi's {{contributions}} to <b>electronic</b> <b>techniques</b> of experimental physics. [...] With absorbers of lead and brass, the number of decays was plotted against time. [...] These decay curves had the same exponential form as those of ordinary radioactive substances, and gave a mean lifetime of 2.3±0.2microseconds, which was later refined to 2.15±0.07microseconds. After the war, Rossi discovered that his Italian colleagues, Marcello Conversi and Oreste Piccioni, had performed experiments very similar to his and measured a lifetime consistent with his result.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "progressive" [...] {{refers to}} {{the wide range of}} {{attempts}} to break with standard pop music formulas through extended instrumentation, personalized lyrics, and individual improvisation. The premise involved popular music that was created with the intention of listening, not dancing, and opposed the influence of managers, agents, or record companies. Progressive music was also mainly produced by the performing artists themselves. In 1970, a journalist at UK publication, Melody Maker, described progressive pop as music made that is appealing to the masses, but less disposable than the [...] "six weeks in the charts and the 'forget it' music of older pop forms." [...] Some stylistic features include changes in key and rhythm or experiments with larger forms. In terms of tonal structure, progressive pop is similar to rock and roll in overthrowing harmony as its basic organizing structure. However, unlike rock and roll, progressive pop inverts received conventions, playing with them ironically, disrupting them, or producing shadows of them in new and unexpected forms. <b>Electronic</b> <b>techniques</b> such as echo, feedback, stereo, loudness, and distortion may be used to give the music the impression of space and lateral extension.|$|E
