40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} of sport-related concussion is debatable. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report an extrapolated {{incidence of}} 1. 6 to 3. 2 million recreational/sports-related traumatic brain injuries a year, the suspicion {{is that the}} incidence is much higher (CDC, 2014). An important consideration in determining the incidence involves whether an athlete’s knowledge of what a concussion is influences their self-report of prior concussions. ^ Purpose: The {{purpose of this study}} is to replicate and extend Pfirman (2015) in determining whether providing information about concussion will increase the self-report of a history of concussion. Furthermore, this study investigates whether there is a difference in self-reporting between males and females and between age groups (18 and over; 17 and under). ^ Study Design: Group design comparing a Pre-Test <b>Information</b> <b>Group</b> and a Post-Test <b>Information</b> <b>Group</b> matched for gender and age. ^ Methods: Before taking the ImPACT test the athletes (participants) will be randomly separated into two <b>groups,</b> the Pre-Test <b>Information</b> <b>Group</b> and the Post-Test <b>Information</b> <b>group.</b> The Pre-Test <b>Information</b> <b>Group</b> will be read a script describing symptoms associated with a concussion prior to taking the ImPACT test, while the Post-Test <b>Information</b> <b>Group</b> will not receive concussion information until after the ImPACT test. Both groups will complete a questionnaire following ImPACT testing that asks: “Based on your experience here today, do you think you have ever had a concussion? What is your age? What grade are you in school? Are you male or female?” ^ Results: A Chi Square analysis yielded that there was no statistically significant difference between the Pre-Test <b>Information</b> <b>Group</b> and the Post-Test <b>Information</b> <b>Group</b> (p= 0. 160). An additional Chi Square analysis found that age of the athletes was not a factor (p= 0. 160), and there was no difference in gender (p= 0. 160). ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In general, many {{real-world}} networks {{not only}} possess scale-free and high clustering coefficient properties, {{but also have}} a <b>fast</b> <b>information</b> transmission capability. However, the existing network models are unable to well present the intrinsic <b>fast</b> <b>information</b> transmission feature. The initial infected nodes and the network topology are two factors that affect the in-formation transmission capability. By using preferential attachment to high proximity prestige nodes and triad formation, we provide a proximity prestige network model, which has scale-free property and high clustering coefficien-t. Simulation results further indicate that the new model also possesses tun-able information transmission capability archived by adjusting its parameters. Moreover, comparing with the BA scale-free network, the proximity prestige network PPNet 05 achieves a higher transmission capability when messages travel based on SIR and SIS models. Our conclusions are directed to possible applications in rumor or information spreading mechanisms...|$|R
