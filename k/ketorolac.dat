25|$|<b>Ketorolac</b> is {{used during}} eye surgery to {{maintain}} mydriasis, or the 'relaxing' of the iris muscles {{that will allow}} surgeons to perform cataract surgery. <b>Ketorolac</b> is effective in treating ocular itching. The <b>ketorolac</b> ophthalmic formulation {{is associated with a}} decreased development of macular edema after cataract surgery and is more effective alone rather than as an opioid/keterolac combination treatment. <b>Ketorolac</b> has also been used to manage pain from corneal abrasions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ketorolac</b> is {{used for}} {{short-term}} management of moderate to severe pain. It is usually not prescribed for longer than five days. <b>Ketorolac</b> is effective when administered with acetaminophen to control pain in neonates {{because it does not}} depress respiration as do opioids. <b>Ketorolac</b> is also an adjuvant to opioid medications and improves pain relief. It is also used to treat dysmenorrhea. <b>Ketorolac</b> is used to treat idiopathic pericarditis, where it reduces inflammation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ketorolac</b> acts by {{inhibiting}} {{the bodily}} synthesis of prostaglandins. <b>Ketorolac</b> in its oral (tablet or capsule) and intramuscular (injected) preparations is a racemic mixture of both (S)-(âˆ’)-ketorolac, the active isomer, and (R)-(+)-ketorolac.|$|E
25|$|Though uncommon, {{potentially}} fatal adverse effects are stroke, myocardial infarction, GI bleeding, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, Toxic epidermal necrolysis and anaphylaxis. A less serious and more common (>10%) side effect is drowsiness. Infrequent (<1%) side effects are paresthesia, prolonged bleeding time, injection site pain, purpura, sweating, abnormal thinking, increased tearing (eyes), edema, pallor, dry mouth, abnormal taste, urinary frequency increased liver enzymes, itching and others. <b>Ketorolac</b> can cause premature constriction of the ductus arteriosis in an infant {{during the third}} trimester of pregnancy. The practice of restricting treatment with <b>ketorolac</b> is due to its potential to cause kidney damage. Platelet function is decreased related {{to the use of}} <b>ketorolac.</b>|$|E
25|$|Interactions with <b>ketorolac</b> exist {{with some}} herbal supplements. Panax ginseng, clove, ginger, arnica, feverfew, dong quai, chamomile, and Ginkgo biloba, {{increases}} the risk of bleeding.|$|E
25|$|In the US, <b>ketorolac</b> was {{the only}} widely {{available}} intravenous NSAID for many years; an IV form of paracetemol became available in Europe in 2009 {{and then in the}} US.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ketorolac,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Toradol among others, is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) in the family of heterocyclic acetic acid derivatives, used as an analgesic. It is considered a first-generation NSAID.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ketorolac</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in those}} with hypersensitivity, allergies to the medication, cross-sensitivity to other NSAIDs, prior to surgery, history of peptic ulcer disease, gastrointestinal bleeding, alcohol intolerance, renal impairment, cerebrovascular bleeding, nasal polyps, angioedema, and asthma.|$|E
25|$|During {{treatment}} with <b>ketorolac,</b> clinicians monitor for {{the manifestation of}} adverse effects and side effects. Lab tests, such as liver function tests, bleeding time, BUN, serum creatinine and electrolyte levels are often used and help to identify potential complications.|$|E
25|$|Concerns {{over the}} high {{incidence}} of reported side effects with <b>ketorolac</b> trometamol led to its withdrawal (apart from the ophthalmic formulation) in several countries, while in others its permitted dosage and maximum duration of treatment have been reduced. From 1990 to 1993, 97 reactions with a fatal outcome were reported worldwide.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ketorolac</b> was {{developed}} in 1989 by Syntex Corp. (now part of Roche). It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1989. The eye-drop formulation {{was approved by the}} FDA in 1992. An intranasal formulation was approved by the FDA in 2010 for short-term management of moderate to moderately severe pain requiring analgesia at the opioid level. As of 2015, the cost for a typical course of medication in the United States is less than US$25.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Ketorolac</b> can {{interact}} with other medications. Probenecid can increase the probability of having an adverse reaction or experiencing a side effect when taken with <b>ketorolac.</b> Pentoxifylline can {{increase the risk of}} bleeding. When aspirin is taken {{at the same time as}} <b>ketorolac,</b> the effectiveness is decreased. Problematic GI effects are additive and become more likely if potassium supplements, aspirin, other NSAIDS, corticosteroids, or alcohol is taken at the same time. The effectiveness of antihypertensives and diuretics can be lowered. [...] The use of <b>ketorolac</b> can increase serum lithium levels to the point of toxicity. Toxicity to methotrexate is more likely if <b>ketorolac</b> is taken at the same time. The risk of bleeding increases with the concurrent medications clopidogrel, cefoperazone, valproic acid, cefotetan, eptifibatide, tirofiban, and copidine. Anticoagulants and thrombolytic medications also increase the likelihood of bleeding. Medications used to treat cancer {{can interact}} with <b>ketorolac</b> along with radiation therapy. The risk of toxicity to the kidneys increases when <b>ketorolac</b> is taken with cyclosporine.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Ketorolac</b> is {{used for}} {{short-term}} pain control not lasting longer than five days, and can be administered orally, by intramuscular injection, intravenously, and by nasal spray. [...] <b>Ketorolac</b> is initially administered by intramuscular injection or intravenously. Oral therapy is only used as a continuation from the intramuscular or intravenous starting point.|$|E
2500|$|The primary {{mechanism}} of action responsible for ketorolac's anti-inflammatory, antipyretic and analgesic effects is the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by competitive blocking of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). <b>Ketorolac</b> is a non-selective COX inhibitor.

2500|$|Pyrrole is a {{precursor}} to the drug tolmetin. [...] Polypyrrole is of some commercial value. [...] N-Methylpyrrole is {{a precursor}} to N-methylpyrrolecarboxylic acid, a building-block in pharmaceutical chemistry. [...] Pyrroles are also found in several drugs, including atorvastatin, <b>ketorolac,</b> and sunitinib. [...] Pyrroles are used as lightfast red, scarlet, and carmine pigments.|$|E
2500|$|Primary Care Paramedics (PCPs) are the {{entry-level}} of paramedic {{practice in}} some Canadian provinces. The scope of practice includes performing semi-automated external defibrillation. Oxygen administration. Establishing an IV. Cardiac monitoring such as Lead 2 and 12 Lead interpretation. Administration of Symptom Relief Medications {{for a variety}} of emergency medical conditions (these include epinephrine, salbutamol, ipratropium bromide, aspirin, nitroglycerine, naloxone, dextrose, thiamine, glucagon, gravol, benadryl and nitrous oxide). In addition, some services have started implementing non-opiate medications so that Primary Care Paramedics can treat patients that require pain management. These medications include <b>ketorolac,</b> aceotominophen and ibuprofen. As of 2015, PCP's can now administer Naloxone for suspected opiate overdose. [...] performing trauma immobilization, including cervical immobilization, and other basic medical care. PCPs may also receive additional training in order to perform certain skills that are normally in the scope of practice of ACPs, such as interpretation or transmission of a 12 lead EKG. This is regulated both provincially (by statute) and locally (by the medical director), and ordinarily entails an aspect of medical oversight by a specific body or group of physicians. [...] This {{is often referred to as}} medical control, and is the role played by a base hospital.|$|E
2500|$|Paramedics in many jurisdictions {{administer}} {{a variety}} of emergency medications; the individual medications vary widely, based on physician (medical director) direction and local law. These drugs may include Adenocard (Adenosine), which stops and resets a heart that is beating too rapidly, and Atropine, which speeds a heartbeat that is too slow. [...] The list may include sympathomimetics like dopamine for severe hypotension (low blood pressure) and cardiogenic shock. Diabetics often benefit {{from the fact that}} paramedics are able to give D50W (Dextrose 50%) to treat hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). They can treat crisis and anxiety conditions. Some advanced paramedics may also be permitted to perform rapid sequence induction; a rapid way of obtaining an advanced airway with the use of paralytics and sedatives, using such medications as Versed, Ativan, or Etomidate, and paralytics such as succinylcholine, rocuronium, or vecuronium. Paramedics in some jurisdictions may also be permitted to sedate combative patients using antipsychotics like Haldol or Geodon. The use of medications for treating respiratory conditions such as, albuterol, atrovent, and methylprednisolone is common. Paramedics may also be permitted to administer medications such as those that relieve pain or decrease nausea and vomiting. Nitroglycerin, baby aspirin, and morphine sulfate may be administered for chest pain. Paramedics may also use other medications and antiarrhythmics like amiodarone to treat cardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation not responding to defibrillation. Paramedics also treat for severe pain, i.e. burns or fractures, with narcotics like morphine sulfate, pethidine, fentanyl and in some jurisdictions, <b>ketorolac.</b> [...] This list is not representative of all jurisdictions, and EMS jurisdictions may vary greatly in what is permitted. Some jurisdictions may not permit administration of certain classes of drugs, or may use drugs other than the ones listed for the same purposes. For an accurate description of permitted drugs or procedures in a given location, it is necessary to contact that jurisdiction directly.|$|E

It is approved through much of Europe for short term perioperative pain control much in the same way <b>ketorolac</b> (Toradol) is used in the United States. However, unlike <b>ketorolac,</b> parecoxib has no effect on platelet function and therefore does not promote bleeding during or after surgery. In addition, <b>ketorolac</b> has a much higher gastrointestinal toxicity profile compared to most other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including ibuprofen and naprosyn.
