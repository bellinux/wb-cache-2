Besides {{directly}} displaying their charms to potential clients they had recourse to publicity; sandals with marked soles have been found which left an imprint that stated [...] AKOLOUTHEI ("Follow me") on the ground. They also used makeup, apparently quite outrageously. Eubulus, a comic author, offers these courtesans derision: [...] "plastered over with layers of white lead, … jowls smeared with mulberry juice. And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> on a summer's day, two rills of inky water flow from your eyes, and the sweat rolling from your cheeks upon your throat makes a vermilion furrow, while the hairs blown about on your faces look grey, they are so full of white lead".|$|E

You are old to go as an apprentice, but not too old, and that plan could be carried out; still, we both think that the other is better.

6000|$|There are two {{or three}} points which I wish to bring clearly before your notice about such a reef as this. In the first place, you {{perceive}} it forms a kind of fringe round the island, and is therefore called a [...] "fringing reef." [...] In the next place, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> in a boat, and take soundings {{at the edge of}} the reef, you find that the depth of the water is not more than from 20 to 25 fathoms--that is about 120 to 150 feet. Outside that point you come to the natural sea bottom; but all inside that depth is coral, built up from the bottom by the accumulation of the skeletons of innumerable generations of coral polypes. So that you see the coral forms a very considerable rampart round the island. What the exact circumference may be I do not remember, but it cannot be less than 100 miles, and the outward height of this wall of coral rock nowhere amounts to less than about 100 or 150 feet.|$|E

60|$|There wasn't even a bell or a speaking-tube in the castle. I had a {{great many}} servants, and those that were on duty lolled in the anteroom; and when I wanted one of them I {{had to go and}} call for him. There was no gas, there were no candles; a bronze dish half full of boarding-house butter with a blazing rag {{floating}} in it was the thing that produced what was regarded as light. A lot of these hung along the walls and modified the dark, just toned it down enough to make it dismal. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> at night, your servants carried torches. There were no books, pens, paper or ink, and no glass in the openings they believed to be windows. It is a little thing--glass is--until it is absent, then it becomes a big thing. But perhaps the worst of all was, that there wasn't any sugar, coffee, tea, or tobacco. I saw that I was just another Robinson Crusoe cast away on an uninhabited island, with no society but some more or less tame animals, and if I wanted to make life bearable I must do as he did--invent, contrive, create, reorganize things; set brain and hand to work, and keep them busy. Well, that was in my line.|$|R
60|$|IT {{was late}} June, almost July, when Corey {{took up his}} life in Boston again, where the summer slips away so easily. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> of town early, it seems a very long summer {{when you come back}} in October; but if you stay, it passes swiftly, and, seen {{foreshortened}} in its flight, seems scarcely a month's length. It has its days of heat, when it is very hot, {{but for the most part}} it is cool, with baths of the east wind that seem to saturate the soul with delicious freshness. Then there are stretches of grey westerly weather, when the air is full of the sentiment of early autumn, and the frying, of the grasshopper in the blossomed weed of the vacant lots on the Back Bay is intershot with the carol of crickets; and the yellowing leaf on the long slope of Mt. Vernon Street smites the sauntering observer with tender melancholy. The caterpillar, gorged with the spoil of the lindens on Chestnut, and weaving his own shroud about him in his lodgment on the brick-work, records the passing of summer by mid-July; and if after that comes August, its breath is thick and short, and September is upon the sojourner before he has fairly had time to philosophise the character of the town out of season.|$|E
6000|$|He {{declared}} {{the nature of}} the plot, and boldly said that, such being the facts, Catiline deserved death. [...] "If," [...] he says, [...] "I should order you to be taken and killed, believe me I should be blamed rather for my delay in doing so than for my cruelty." [...] He spoke throughout as though all the power were in his own hands, either to strike or to forbear. But it was his object to drive him out and not to kill him. [...] "Go," [...] he said; [...] "that camp of yours and Mallius, your lieutenant, are too long without you. Take your friends with you. Take them all. Cleanse the city of your presence. When its walls are between you and me then I shall feel myself secure. Among us here you may no longer stir yourself. I will not have it--I will not endure it. If I were to suffer you to be killed, your followers in the conspiracy would remain here; but <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out,</b> as I desire you, this cesspool of filth will drain itself off from out the city. Do you hesitate to do at my command that which you would fain do yourself? The Consul requires an enemy to depart from the city. Do you ask me whether you are to go into exile? I do not order it; but if you ask my counsel, I advise it." [...] Exile was the severest punishment known by the Roman law, as applicable to a citizen, and such a punishment it was in the power of no Consul or other officer of state to inflict. Though he had taken upon himself the duty of protecting the Republic, still he could not condemn a citizen. It was to the moral effect of his words that he must trust: [...] "Non jubeo, sed si me consulis, suadeo." [...] Catiline heard him to the end, and then, muttering a curse, left the Senate, and went out of the city. Sallust tells us that he threatened to extinguish, {{in the midst of the}} general ruin he would create, the flames prepared for his own destruction. Sallust, however, was not present on the occasion, and the threat probably had been uttered at an earlier period of Catiline's career. Cicero tells us expressly, in one of his subsequent works, that Catiline was struck dumb.[200] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will {{naturally}} feel some curiosity about your new home," [...] she began, [...] "and I haven't {{said a word}} about it yet. How very thoughtless of me! Inside and out, dear Miss Emily, our house is just a little dull. I say our house, and why not--when the management of it is all thrown on me. We are built of stone; and we are much too long, and are not half high enough. Our situation is on the coldest side of the county, away in the west. We are close to the Cheviot hills; and if you fancy there is anything to see when you look out of window, except sheep, you will find yourself woefully mistaken. As for walks, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> {{on one side of the}} house you may, or may not, be gored by cattle. On the other side, if the darkness overtakes you, you may, or may not, tumble down a deserted lead mine. But the company, inside the house, makes amends for it all," [...] Mrs. Rook proceeded, enjoying the expression of dismay which was beginning to show itself on Emily's face. [...] "Plenty of excitement for you, my dear, in our small family. Sir Jervis will introduce you to plaster casts of hideous Indian idols; he will keep you writing for him, without mercy, from morning to night; and when he does let you go, old Miss Redwood will find she can't sleep, and will send for the pretty young lady-secretary to read to her. My husband I am sure you will like. He is a respectable man, and bears the highest character. Next to the idols, he's the most hideous object in the house. If you are good enough to encourage him, I don't say that he won't amuse you; he will tell you, for instance, he never in his life hated any human being as he hates his wife. By the way, I must not forget--in the interests of truth, you know--to mention one drawback that does exist in our domestic circle. One of these days we shall have our brains blown out or our throats cut. Sir Jervis's mother left him ten thousand pounds' worth of precious stones all contained in a little cabinet with drawers. He won't let the banker take care of his jewels; he won't sell them; he won't even wear one of the rings on his finger, or one of the pins at his breast. He keeps his cabinet on his dressing-room table; and he says, 'I like to gloat over my jewels, every night, before I go to bed.' Ten thousand pounds' worth of diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires, and what not--at the mercy of the first robber who happens to hear of them. Oh, my dear, he would have no choice, I do assure you, but to use his pistols. We shouldn't quietly submit to be robbed. Sir Jervis inherits the spirit of his ancestors. My husband has the temper of a game cock. I myself, in defense of the property of my employers, am capable of becoming a perfect fiend. And we none of us understand the use of firearms!" ...|$|E
