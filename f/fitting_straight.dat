This paper proposed a vanishing point detection and estimation method in the dual image space. First, edge line segments are extracted.

Third, vanishing points are estimated by grouping and <b>fitting</b> <b>straight</b> lines across those clusters. The novel points of our method are: 1) automatically grouping the edge line segments that are the support of a vanishing point; 2) calculating the vanishing points by <b>fitting</b> <b>straight</b> lines in the dual space.

40|$|We {{present a}} study on the stellar age and {{metallicity}} distributions for 1105 galaxies using the STARLIGHT software on MaNGA integral field spectra. We derive age and metallicity gradients by <b>fitting</b> <b>straight</b> lines to the radial profiles, and explore their correlations with total stellar mass M*, NUV-r colour and environments, as identified by both the large scale structure (LSS) type and the local density. We find that the mean age and metallicity gradients are close to zero but slightly negative, which is consistent with the inside-out formation scenario. Within our sample, we find that both the age and metallicity gradients show weak or no correlation with either the LSS type or local density environment. In addition, we also study the environmental dependence of age and metallicity values at the effective radii. The age and metallicity values are highly correlated with M* and NUV-r and are also dependent on LSS type as well as local density. Low-mass galaxies tend to be younger and have lower metallicity in low-density environments while high-mass galaxies are less affected by environment.
