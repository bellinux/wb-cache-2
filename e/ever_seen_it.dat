5|$|The {{head of the}} {{delegation}} to Riel was Gabriel Dumont, a respected buffalo hunter {{and leader of the}} Saint-Laurent Métis who had known Riel in Manitoba. James Isbister was the lone Anglo-Métis delegate. Riel was easily swayed to support their cause—which was perhaps not surprising in view of Riel's continuing conviction that he was the divinely selected leader of the Métis and the prophet of a new form of Christianity. Riel also intended to use the new position of influence to pursue his own land claims in Manitoba. The party departed 4 June, and arrived back at Batoche on 5 July. Upon his arrival Métis and English settlers alike formed an initially favourable impression of Riel following a series of speeches in which he advocated moderation and a reasoned approach. During June 1884, the Plains Cree leaders Big Bear and Poundmaker were independently formulating their complaints, and subsequently held meetings with Riel. However, the Native grievances were quite {{different from those of the}} settlers, and nothing was then resolved. Inspired by Riel, Honoré Jackson and representatives of other communities set about drafting a petition, and Jackson on 28 July released a manifesto detailing grievances and the settler's objectives. A joint English-Métis central committee with Jackson acting as secretary worked to reconcile proposals from different communities. In the interim, Riel's support began to waver. As Riel's religious pronouncements became increasingly heretical the clergy distanced themselves, and father Alexis André cautioned Riel against mixing religion and politics. Also, in response to bribes by territorial lieutenant-governor and Indian commissioner Edgar Dewdney, local English-language newspapers adopted an editorial stance critical of Riel. Nevertheless, the work continued, and on 16 December Riel forwarded the committee's petition to the government, along with the suggestion that delegates be sent to Ottawa to engage in direct negotiation. Receipt of the petition was acknowledged by Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau, Macdonald's Secretary of State, although Macdonald himself would later deny having <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it.</b> By then many original followers had left; only 250 remained at Batoche when it fell in May 1885.|$|E
25|$|His {{favourite}} {{part for}} the stage was the lead in Ibsen's Brand, for which he received an award. It appeared in a (still extant) BBC television production in August 1959. Michael Meyer thought that McGoohan's performance in Meyer's translation of Brand in 1959 was {{the best and most}} powerful performances he'd <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>It</b> was McGoohan's last appearance on stage for 28 years.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, Niven met Hjördis Paulina Tersmeden (née Genberg, 1919–1997), a {{divorced}} Swedish fashion model. He recounted their meeting:I {{had never seen}} anything so beautiful in my life—tall, slim, auburn hair, up-tilted nose, lovely mouth and the most enormous grey eyes I had <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>It</b> really happened the way it does when written by the worst lady novelists...

25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Kanin began solo writing in earnest with Heat of Anger, about a strong, older woman lawyer played by Susan Hayward, {{and a younger}} male lawyer. At first Kanin was {{put off by the}} lack of an {{immediate}} reaction from an audience, but once she realized that more people had seen it in one night than would have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> in theaters if it played for a year, she was hooked and wrote five more films for television.|$|E
500|$|The four {{ships of}} Battleship Division Nine—accompanied by the {{destroyer}} —got underway from Lynnhaven Roads, Virginia on 25 November 1917, {{bound for the}} anchorage of the Grand Fleet at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands. What should have been an uneventful transit was complicated by weather that began bad and only got worse as the voyage progressed. After battling a vicious northwester that brought sleet, hail, and snow, the division was further buffeted by a severe gale off the Grand Banks that began on 29 November. Captain Henry Wiley of Wyoming would later recall of that storm, [...] "At {{the height of the}} gale, it blew as hard as I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it,</b> and the seas were the worst I could recollect." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{event was}} {{organised}} as a round-robin tournament {{in which each}} of the six teams would play each other once between 25 and 31 July. [...] Two points were awarded for a win and one for a draw; the team with the most points at the end would be the winner. The other competitors were Austria, Czechoslovakia, India, Poland and the USSR; apart from the Soviets, all of these teams were competing {{as a result of the}} boycott, having failed to qualify initially. All of the matches were played at Dynamo Minor Arena in Moscow. Zimbabwe arrived two weeks before the hockey tournament was due to start, and warmed up with a number of matches against local teams. The players' lack of preparation and unfamiliarity with artificial turf—"none of us had <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> before", Chick recalled—were offset by what several members of the squad have described as a very strong team spirit. They considered themselves serious underdogs and did not expect to win a medal.|$|E

500|$|Producer Glen Morgan was {{disappointed}} with the resolution regarding the Crew Cut Man, saying [...] "My feeling is that to bring this guy back, his presence should have been better developed, and he's shot off screen. I thought 'Geez, {{this is the guy}} who killed Deep Throat, who the audience loved, and it's kind of tossed away.' The episode just seems like half of one thing for a while, then half of something else. I think that was a curious choice for Chris [...] He wanted to take a real left turn, but I'd rather have seen a whole episode about that guy showing up and Mulder getting back at him." [...] X-Files writer James Wong also had a negative view of the episode, saying [...] "I think {{that was one of the}} most confusing episodes I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>It</b> had some really neat ideas in it, but I don't think it pulled together finally." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{instance}} of murder occurred on October 3, 1880, when Thomas Forrest stabbed Michael Carbis. Carbis, the foreman of the California mine, had fired Forrest {{the day before}} {{on account of his}} violent nature. The murder occurred near the Buckeye boarding house. Forrest initially had a pistol, but he put it away and drew a knife instead when he got within a few feet of Carbis. Carbis died soon after the stab wound was inflicted. Silver Reef's residents were angered by the murder and soon lynch threats were delivered. Forrest, who had been arrested soon after the murder had been committed, was transferred to the jail in St. George for his own safety. Prior to the moving of Forrest, a lynch mob gathered and followed the sheriff's escort to the St. George jail. Once there, they overpowered the sheriff, took Forrest out of his cell, and tried to hang him on a telegraph pole. When the pole broke, they took him to a cottonwood tree and hung him there. The residents of St. George were shocked at the sight of Forrest's hanging, and one man was reputed to have said, [...] "I have observed that tree growing there for the last 25 years. This is the first time I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> bearing fruit." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 1857, an {{expedition}} led by Edward Fitzgerald Beale was tasked with establishing a trade route along the 35th parallel from Fort Smith, Arkansas to Los Angeles, California. The wagon road began at Fort Smith and continued through Fort Defiance, Arizona before crossing the Colorado River near present-day Needles, California. The location where Beale crossed the river, {{en route to}} California, became known as Beale's Crossing. Beale described the route, [...] "It is the shortest from our western frontier by , being nearly directly west. It is the most level: our wagons only double-teaming once in the entire distance, and that at a short hill, and over a surface heretofore unbroken by wheels or trail on any kind. It is well-watered: our greatest distance without water at any time being [...] It is well-timbered, and in many places the growth is far beyond that of {{any part of the}} world I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>It</b> is temperate in climate, passing for the most part over an elevated region. It is salubrious: not one of our party requiring the slightest medical attendance from the time of our leaving to our arrival... It crosses the great desert (which must be crossed by any road to California) at its narrowest point." ...|$|E

5000|$|His four-seamer has the {{smallest}} amount of [...] "rise", or vertical break, among all major league starters since 2007. This sinker-like effect {{gives him the}} best ground ball/fly ball ratio (6:1) among four-seamers in that group. Remarking on its unusual movement, former Twins catcher Ryan Doumit said, [...] "His fastball's unlike anything I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> ... <b>It's</b> like catching a 92-mile-an-hour knuckleball." ...|$|R
500|$|In India, Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... {{met with}} polarised {{reactions}} from film critics. While certain critics praised the visual richness and {{the performances of}} the cast, certain others were negative about the lengthy run time and criticised the script strength and inconsistencies. Khalid Mohamed of The Times of India applauded the film and reviewed, [...] "K3G is the complete commercial banquet delivered with fabulous finesse by Karan Johar. So, go indulge yourself. Cry your heart out and surprisingly, you'll feel life's finally alive and kicking in Mumbai's dream world." [...] Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film 4.5 out of 5 stars. He praised the emotional sequences, {{as well as the}} choreography, production design, costumes, and cinematography. He added that Karan Johar was the real star, for creating many memorable sequences. Rakesh Budhu of Planet Bollywood gave the film 8 out of 10 stars, saying [...] "Dharma Productions has kept its promise in giving us a lovable film to remember in coming times." [...] He pointed out several flaws in the script, but added that the positive aspects of the film managed to outweigh the negative ones. He quoted, [...] "K3G is one heck of an entertainer and was worth the wait". In the film review section of his book Bollywood: An Insider's Guide, Fuad Omar showered overwhelming praise on the film and called it a [...] "masterpiece from the first frame to the last". In summary he said, [...] "Overall Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... is without a doubt the most enthralling, entertaining, emotional and complete vision and definition of Hindi cinema I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>It</b> is simply the perfect Hindi film." ...|$|E
500|$|According to American critic Robert Christgau, Maxinquayes groove-oriented and low-tempo music drew {{not only}} on dub but also on lo-fi, ambient techno, and hip hop, while James Hunter from Rolling Stone said Tricky subsumed American hip hop, soul, reggae, and 1980s English rock sounds into [...] "a mercurial style of dance music". Entertainment Weekly critic David Browne {{classified}} the music as an intellectual form of R. Ben Walsh of The Independent called it an experimental album featuring a [...] "heady blend" [...] of soul, rock, punk, hip hop, dub, and electronica. In Tricky's own words, he composed his songs based on a particular sound he liked rather than having a definite song structure in mind: [...] "I couldn't write you a blues track or a hip-hop track if you asked. I just make what I hear and then me and Martina sing all the words on paper, putting {{the emphasis on the}} things that perhaps shouldn't be sung." [...] Tricky had no concept of pitch, regard for notational conventions and time signatures, or previous experience with sampling, but his approach for Maxinquaye challenged Saunders to rethink his ideas about music production and experiment in ways he had never tried before. Saunders recalled being asked to combine samples of two songs that were 30 beats per minute apart and composed in entirely different keys: [...] " [...] thought differently to anybody I've ever known ... It didn't occur to me that by de-tuning one to slow it down, both might then gel musically at that point. I always think of it like going into a scrapyard and building a car out of all the bits you can find. You could probably build a car that would work, and although it might be the ugliest you've <b>ever</b> <b>seen,</b> <b>it</b> would have loads of character." ...|$|E

There were no large changes {{in the amount of}} the seepage that was collected and, month after month, the pipe flowed about one-third full. This is an insignificant amount for a dam the size of the St. Francis, and on this subject Mulholland said, [...] "Of all the dams I have built and of all the dams I have <b>ever</b> <b>seen,</b> <b>it</b> was the driest dam of its size I ever saw." [...] The seepage data recorded during the 1926–1927 period shows that the dam was an exceptionally dry structure.|$|E
2500|$|Fitch {{was able}} to damage Ike Clanton's {{credibility}} through skillful questioning. In response to his questioning, Clanton denied seeking confirmation from Wyatt Earp about the reward offered by Wells, Fargo & Co, [...] "dead or alive", for the stage robbers.

On November 12, he got Clanton to testify {{that he had never}} spoken to Ned Boyle {{on the morning of the}} gunfight, and on November 23, Boyle's testimony contradicted Clanton's.

Even after Howard's P-51 ran out of ammunition, he continued to dive on enemy airplanes. The leader of the bomber formation later reported, [...] "For sheer determination and guts, {{it was the greatest}} exhibition I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>It</b> was a case of one lone American against what seemed to be the entire Luftwaffe.

[...] Contacting Lynch, he agreed to help him with his next planned project, a film titled Ronnie Rocket for which Lynch had already written a script. However, Lynch soon realized that Ronnie Rocket, a film that he described as being about [...] "electricity and a three-foot guy with red hair", {{was not going to be}} picked up by any financiers, and so he asked Cornfeld to find him a script written by someone else which he could direct. Cornfeld found him four possible scripts. On hearing the title of the first, The Elephant Man, Lynch chose the script.|$|E

It was bigger than anything that I've <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> <b>It</b> remains a great mystery. Other people saw it, responsible people. I don't know why people would ridicule it." [...] He continued, [...] "It was enormous and inexplicable. Who knows where it came from? A lot of people saw it, and I saw it too. It was dramatic. And it couldn't have been flares because it was too symmetrical. It had a geometric outline, a constant shape." [...] As Governor during the Phoenix Lights, Symington stated he would investigate the event, but went on to hold a press conference where he had his chief of staff dress up in an alien costume. He later stated that as a public official he felt a responsibility to avert public panic and therefore made an attempt to introduce some levity into the situation.|$|E
2500|$|His {{fourth and}} final Soviet trip was once more to Central Asia, spurred {{by the desire to}} reach Bokhara (Bukhara, Uzbekistan), the capital of the emirate which had been closed to Europeans until recent times. Maclean recounts how Charles Stoddart and Arthur Conolly were {{executed}} there in the context of The Great Game, and how Joseph Wolff, known as the Eccentric Missionary, barely escaped their fate when he came looking for them in 1845. In early October 1938 Maclean set out again, first for Ashkhabad (Ashgabat, capital of the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic), then through the Kara Kum (Black Desert), not breaking his journey at either Tashkent or Samarkand, but pushing on to Kagan, the nearest point on the railway to Bokhara. [...] After trying to smuggle himself aboard a lorry transporting cotton, he ended up walking to the city, and spent several days sight-seeing [...] "in the steps of the Eccentric Missionary" [...] and sleeping in parks, much to the frustration of the NKVD spies who were shadowing him. He judged it an [...] "enchanted city", with buildings that rivalled [...] "the finest architecture of the Italian Renaissance". [...] Aware of his limited time, he cut short his wanderings and took the train towards Stalinabad (Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan), disembarking at Termez. This town sits on the Amu Darya (the Oxus), and {{the other side of the}} river lies in Afghanistan. Maclean claimed that [...] "very few Europeans except Soviet frontier guards have <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> at this or any other point of its course". After more negotiations, he managed to cross the river and thus leave the USSR, and from that point his only guide seems to have been the narrative of [...] "the Russian Burnaby", a colonel , who rode from Samarkand to Mazar-i-Sharif and Herat in 1878. The following day he and a guide set out on horseback, riding through jungle and desert, and detained on the way by dubious characters who may or may not have been brigands. (Maclean, a proficient linguist, was hamstrung on entering Afghanistan by the lack of any lingua franca.) [...] They rode past the ruins of Balkh, a civilization founded by Alexander the Great and destroyed by Genghis Khan. [...] After a night in Mazar, Maclean managed to get a car and driver, and progressed as rapidly as he could to Doaba, a village half-way to Kabul, where he had arranged to meet the British minister (i.e., ambassador), Colonel Frazer-Tytler. Together, they returned to the capital via Bamyan and its famous statues. Maclean circled back to Moscow via Peshawar, Delhi, Baghdad, Persia, and Armenia.|$|E
