40|$|Great {{interest}} has arisen in metallic mining at various locations in Wisconsin. The Flambeau copper mine was operated in northwestern Wisconsin from 1992 to 1997 {{and a large}} zinc and copper mine is being proposed for northeastern Wisconsin. Also, exploration is being conducted at several other sites in western Wisconsin for potential mine sites. Concurrently, significant concern has developed regarding the potential for environmental impacts <b>of</b> <b>mining,</b> particularly the pollution of groundwater. Mining’s greatest threat to Wisconsin groundwater is pollution from <b>drainage</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> tailings. Tailings are the residue remaining after benefication <b>of</b> the ore. <b>Drainage</b> from tailings may consist of process water present {{at the time of}} disposal (tailings are often disposed in a slurry form) or acidic water caused by percolate passing through tailings undergoing oxidation. <b>Drainage</b> <b>of</b> process water or acidified water can pose a significant threat to groundwater because both liquids usually contain a variety of toxic heavy metals. Statement of Results or Benefits: Mine wastes have significant potential to affect groundwater quality in Wisconsin, the region, and the nation. This is a timely issue because of the major debate taking place in Wisconsin regarding metallic mining and the issues faced by the citizens and the regulatory staff in permit review <b>of</b> <b>mines.</b> There is a need to understand whether the containment systems proposed to contain mine waste will be effective in preventing groundwater pollution.

40|$|The geochemical {{composition}} of the surface sediments has been analyzed for three estuaries located in the Huelva coast: Guadiana, Piedras and Ría de Huelva (Tinto and Odiel river estuaries) and it has determined the Enrichment Factor for analyzed elements. Between studied major elements, detach the high concentrations of Fe 2 O 3 and P 2 O 5 present in the Ría de Huelva sediments, with EF values of 4 and 15, respectively. In both cases the origin of these concentrations is antropogenic. Fe 2 O 3 is introduced to the estuary by the acid contributions of the Tinto and Odiel rivers, and the P 2 O 5 result from the spills of the phosphatic rocks. The sediments of the Guadiana and Piedras rivers show no significant EF in studied metals. On the contrary, the Ría de Huelva sediments show EF very high for metals related to the acid <b>mine</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine,</b> thus the Cu displays EF values of 75. 6, 36. 9 for Zn and 58 for Pb.

In order {{to study the}} possibility of using the behavioural early warning responses of Portuguese indigenous benthic invertebrates to detect an acute short-term pulse <b>of</b> Acid <b>Mine</b> <b>Drainage</b> (AMD), experiments with the Multispecies Freshwater Biomonitor MFB (TM) were performed and locomotion and ventilation were measured as endpoints. AMD was collected from the "Sao Domingos" mine (Southeast Portugal) and the following species were selected: Echinogammarus meridionalis (Pinkster, 1973). Hydropsyche pellucidula (Curtis, 1834) and Choroterpes picteti (Eaton, 1870). For simulating the pulsed exposure, AMD was added to river water where invertebrates were collected and pH was lowered until reaching 3. 5. The effects of H(+) and heavy metals were discriminated using HCl positive controls. In addition to behaviour, mortality was registered. E. meridionalis was the most sensitive species in terms of mortality and behavioural endpoints, followed by C. picteti and H. pellucidula. E. meridionalis early warning responses consisted of increased locomotion with subsequent increase in ventilation, whereas for C. picteti only an increase in locomotion was observed. H. pellucidula showed no early warning responses.

40|$|International audienceThe {{chemical}} and isotopic compositions of river and groundwater reflect the different natural processes that provide chemical elements to the dissolved load, i. e. mainly the weathering {{of rocks and}} soils, atmospheric inputs and anthropogenic disturbances. This study reports on the geochemistry of surface- and groundwater along {{a part of the}} Subarnarekha River system (north-eastern India) collected during monsoon and dry season, during a monitoring program aimed at evaluating impacts <b>of</b> <b>mining</b> and metallurgy on the river system. The aquifer is of fracture type and the seasonal behaviour, groundwater flow conditions and pollutant transfer were observed through a network of 69 wells with typical depths of 50 meters. Geochemical observations, including major cations and anions, trace element concentrations and isotopic tracing (stable isotopes of the water molecule, strontium isotopes) come to conclusions on the origin and the relationships between the surface- and groundwater in the studied catchment. A large range of salinities is observed in surface- and groundwater, both for dry or wet periods. Surface water samples plot within the field HCO 3 -Ca during both water stages. Most groundwater samples plot within the field of Ca-SO 4 water type and HCO 3 -Ca water type. This reflects the high Ca input in groundwater, other than weathering. Such inputs could be related to (i) carbonate amendments used in agricultural practices and (ii) residues from ore processing. With regards to stable isotopes  18 O and  2 H, many groundwater samples plot between local meteoric water lines and the global meteoric water line, reflecting a meteoric origin for the water without any major transformation like evaporation. This suggests that transfer from rainfall towards groundwater storage through soils and the non-saturated zone is fast. The scatter of 87 Sr/ 86 Sr signatures in surface- and groundwater cannot be explained by less than 3 end-member compositions. The most dilute end-member should be compatible with rainwater inputs. The most mineralised end-member has isotopic compositions very similar to the dilute one, and is believed to represent anthropogenic inputs. The third end-member is characterised by an intermediate Sr content and a more radiogenic signature. It is believed to be controlled by a natural background, however affected by human activities (e. g. <b>drainage</b> <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> waste). Potential flow paths were investigated north of the area. Under the light of different geochemical tools, all groundwater types in this area seem to evolve more as in close pockets than along a flow path. This is consistent with groundwater head contour maps that do not reflect any groundwater flow directions, as groundwater bodies evolve in discontinuous or isolated units. The limited extent of transfer and the predominance of natural phenomena contribute to explain the moderate level of groundwater contamination and the characteristics of surface water contamination by mining and metallurgy...|$|R

In the first 30 m along the Reigous, a small creek draining the site, more than 38 % of the dissolved arsenic was removed by co-precipitation with Fe(III), in agreement with previous studies, which suggest a role of microbial activities in the co-precipitation of As(III) and As(V) with Fe(III) and sulfate. To investigate how this particular ecosystem functions, the bacterial community was characterized in water and sediments by 16 S rRNA encoding gene library analysis. Based on the results obtained using a metaproteomic approach on sediments combined with high-sensitivity HPLC-chip spectrometry, several GroEL orthologs expressed by the community were characterized, and the active members of the prokaryotic community inhabiting the creek sediments were identified.

Valorisation of NaCl as raw material is required to meet the membrane electrolysis specifications of NaCl saturation and control of interferences (Ca, Mg and sulphate). Brines concentration in NaCl was previously achieved for SWRO brines using electrodialysis (ED). In this work, valorisation of Ca and Mg by-products via selective recovery was evaluated.; RESULTSRecovery of Ca(II) and Mg(II) using chemical precipitation with Na 2 CO 3 and NaOH was evaluated at 25 degrees C and 65 degrees C using one single reagent and mixtures of reagents. The excess of reactants needed to achieve the maximum removal efficiency ranged from 0. 35 to 14 g L- 1 Na 2 CO 3 and 0. 85 g L- 1 NaOH. Selective concentration of SWRO brines by ED benefited the purification, as it slightly diluted the antiscalants. The increase of temperatures also benefited their removal process.; CONCLUSIONSTotal chemical analysis of Ca and Mg by-products showed the presence of mixed salts of Ca and Mg when Na 2 CO 3 was used and more pure precipitates of Mg when NaOH was used. In both cases, small amounts of minor traces initially present in the brines were found. (c) 2014 Society of Chemical Industry. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R

This work evaluates the magnitude and pattern of Hg dissipation from an abandoned pyrite mines to the local water ecosystem by testing of the stream bottom sediments and water invertebrate Micronecta scholtzi along the pyrite-cupric mine drainage system. Overall results showed a high significant correlation (Pearson coefficient = 0. 82 at p< 0. 05) between mercury levels in biota and those in sediments for all the sampling sites. In the sediments Hg concentrations ranged from 14. 4 - 32. 4 mu g g(- 1) dw decreasing downstream to 3. 67 - 5. 3 mu g g(- 1) due to natural dilution. He, concentration in M. scholtzi showed a similar trend ranging from 3. 6 - 12. 6 mu g g(- 1) dw at the mine pit and decreasing 5 Km downstream to 0. 2 - 1. 6 mu g g(- 1) thus reflecting the significant Hg dissipation in surface sediments. Reported Hg levels in sediments were very high and significantly above threshold limits defined by the legislation for the protection of aquatic biota. The Hg in stream sediments derived from such mining areas is potentially hazardous to the environment adjacent to the abandoned mine and this work proves that Hg is mobilised from the mines and accumulated by local water biota, posing a risk to surrounding freshwater systems...|$|R

Coring of sediments throughout Macquarie Harbour indicated that mine tailings accreted most rapidly close to the King River delta source with {{a significant reduction in}} thickness of tailings and heavy metal contamination with increasing distance from the King River source. Close to the King River delta the mine tailings are readily discriminated from the background estuarine sediments on the basis of visual logging of the core (laminations, colour), sediment grain size, sediment magnetic susceptibility and elemental geochemistry, especially concentrations of the heavy metals Cu, Zn and Pb. The high heavy metal concentrations are demonstrated by the very high contamination factors (CF > 6) for Cu and Zn, with CF values mostly > 50 for Cu for the mine-impacted sediments. Although the addition <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> waste into the King River catchment has ceased, the catchment continues {{to be a source of}} these heavy metals due to acid rock <b>drainage</b> and remobilisation <b>of</b> <b>mine</b> waste in storage in the river banks, river bed and delta.

Nevertheless, the impact <b>of</b> considerable coal <b>mine</b> methane emission on climate change in China has gained an increasing attention as coal production has powered the country 2 ̆ 7 s economic development. It is well-known that coal bed methane is a typical greenhouse gas, the greenhouse effect index of which is 30 times larger than that of carbon dioxide. Besides, gas disasters such as gas explosive and outburst, etc. pose a great threat {{to the safety of}} miners. Therefore, measures must be taken to capture coal mine methane before mining. This helps to enhance safety during mining and extract an environmentally friendly gas as well. However, as a majority of coal seams in China have low-permeability, it is difficult to achieve efficient methane drainage. Enhancing coal permeability is a good choice for high-efficiency <b>drainage</b> <b>of</b> coal <b>mine</b> methane. In this paper, a modified coal-methane co-exploitation model was established and a combination of drilling–slotting-separation–sealing was proposed to enhance coal permeability and CBM recovery. Firstly, rapid drilling assisted by water-jet and significant permeability enhancement via pressure relief were investigated, guiding the fracture network formation around borehole for high efficient gas flow. Secondly, based on the principle of swirl separation, the coal–water–gas separation instrument was developed to eliminate the risk of gas accumulation during slotting and reduce the gas emission from the ventilation air. Thirdly, to improve the performance of sealing material, we developed a novel cement-based composite sealing material based on the microcapsule technique. Additionally, a novel sealing–isolation combination technique was also proposed. Results of field test indicate that gas concentration in slotted boreholes is 1. 05 – 1. 91 times higher than that in conventional boreholes. Thus, the proposed novel integrated techniques achieve the goal of high-efficiency coal bed methane recovery...|$|R

40|$|At a {{time when}} budgets are tight, it is {{increasingly}} important to maximise the use of gas reservoir information. This paper presents methods for leveraging gas content and permeability data and quantifying uncertainty. The objective is to adequately define the gas reservoir in terms relevant to how the data will be applied - for the least expenditure and risk. In the case of gas content, reduction in data noise reveals underlying trends that can then be mapped across a deposit. Essentially defining gas domains, with equations and uncertainty, it permits more targeted drilling and rationalisation of exploration plans. Permeability data are invariably sparse and yet critical in reservoir assessments. Two methods are presented to extend the range of direct well test data – the first maps inherent fracture development based on residuals of the Initial Desorption Rate (IDR 30) /gas content relationship. The second provides a process for utilising observed relationships between permeability, depth and gas saturation to map permeability distribution with quantified uncertainty.

Organic heavy metal complexes were isolated from this solution by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Different size classes of molecules were collected from the column effluent, depending on their elution time, and were characterized by UV spectroscopy, ICP-OES, and DOC measurements. All samples held organic heavy metal compounds with different retention times. The organic heavy metal complexes in acid mine drainage had higher retention times than complexes from municipal wastewater. Most interestingly, we found different affinities of heavy metals to different size classes of DOC. This affinity of the heavy metals differs with size and origin of the DOC. [References: 47...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{bioleaching}} efficiency of arsenic-rich gold concentrates, a mixed bacterial flora had been developed, and the mutation breeding method was adopted to conduct the research. The original mixed bacterial flora had been enrichedin acid <b>mine</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>of</b> Dexing copper <b>mine,</b> Jiangxi Province, China. It was induced by UV (ultraviolet), ultrasonic, and microwave, and their combination mutation. The most efficient bacterial flora after mutation was collected for further bioleaching of arsenic-rich gold concentrates. Results indicated that the bacterial flora after mutation by UV 60 [*]s combined with ultrasonic 10 [*]min had the best oxidation rate of ferrous, the biggest density of cells, and the most activity of total protein. During bioleaching of arsenic-rich gold concentrates, {{the density of the}} mutant bacterial cells reached to 1. 13 × 108 cells/mL at 15 days, more than 10 times compared with that of the original culture. The extraction of iron reached to 95. 7 % after 15 days, increased by 9. 9 % compared with that of the original culture. The extraction of arsenic reached to 92. 6 % after 12 days, which was increased by 46. 1 %. These results suggested that optimum combined mutation could improve leaching ability of the bacterial flora more significantly...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that a mix made from fly and bottom ash from atmospheric pressure fluidized bed coal combusters (FBC ash), water, and stabilizers be injected from the surface into abandoned room and pillar coal mines through boreholes. Besides ash disposal, this process would prevent subsidence and acid mine drainage. Such a mix (called `grout`) needs to be an adequately stable and flowable suspension for it to spread and cover large areas in the mine. This is necessary as the drilling of the boreholes will be an expensive operation and the number such holes should be minimized. Addition of bentonite {{was found to be}} needed for this purpose. A suitable grout mix was tested rheologically to determine its fluid flow properties. Finding little published information on such materials, tests were performed using a commercial rotational viscometer with a T-bar rotor and a stand which produced a helical rotor path. Existing mixer viscometer test methods were modified and adapted to convert the measurements of torque vs. angular speed to the material properties appearing in several non-Newtonian constitutive equations. Yield stress was measured by an independent test called the vane method. The rheological behavior was a close fit to the Bingham fluid model. Bleed tests were conducted to ascertain the stability of the mixtures. Spread tests were conducted to compare the flowability of various mixes. Using the flow parameters determined in the laboratory, numerical simulations of grout flow were performed and compared with the results of scale model and field tests. A field injection of this grout was performed at the Fairfax mines in Preston county, W. V [...] The observations there proved that this FBC ash grout flows as desired, is a very economical way of disposing the environmentally menacing ash, while also preventing the subsidence and acid <b>mine</b> <b>drainage</b> <b>of</b> the <b>mines...</b>|$|R
50|$|The Vinegar Hill-Indian Rock Scenic Area is a high-elevation scenic {{area in the}} {{northeast}} portion of the Malheur National Forest. It provides vistas of the North Fork John Day Wilderness, the Middle and North Fork <b>drainages</b> <b>of</b> the John Day River, and the peaks of the Strawberry Mountain Wilderness to the south. Many species of alpine wildflower found west of the Rocky Mountains grow in the area. Big game species and upland game birds are common. The area's rich geologic past means a variety of rock formations including basalt, rhyolite, granite, and shales can be seen here. The area has a history <b>of</b> <b>mining,</b> and active and decaying remains <b>of</b> <b>mines</b> can be seen. Motor vehicles are prohibited, except during winter when snowmobiles are allowed.|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of seam {{gas in the}} form of methane or carbon dioxide presents a hazard to underground coal mining operations. In-seam drilling has been undertaken for the past three decades for gas drainage {{to reduce the risk of}} gas outburst and lower the concentrations of seam gas in the underground ventilation. The drilling practices have reflected the standards of the times and have evolved with the development of technology and equipment and the needs to provide a safe mining environment underground. Early practice was to adapt equipment from other fields, with rotary drilling being the only form of drilling available. This form <b>of</b> <b>drainage</b> allowed various levels <b>of</b> gas <b>drainage</b> coverage but with changing emphasis, research and development within the coal industry has created specific equipment, technology and practices to accurately place in-seam boreholes to provide efficient and effective gas drainage. Research into gas content determination established a standard for the process and safe levels for mining operations to continue. Surveying technology improved from the wire-line, single-shot Eastman survey instruments which was time-dependent on borehole depth to electronic instruments located in the drill string which transmitted accurate survey data to the drilling crew without time delays. This allowed improved directional control and increased drilling rates. Directional drilling technology has now been established as the industry standard to provide effective gas drainage drilling. Exploration was identified as an additional benefit with directional drilling as it has the ability to provide exploration data from long boreholes. The ability of the technology to provide safe and reliable means to investigate the need for inrush protection and water <b>drainage</b> ahead <b>of</b> <b>mining</b> has been established. Directional drilling technology has now been introduced to the Chinese coal industry for gas drainage through a practice of auditing, design, supply, training and ongoing support. Experienced drilling crews can offer site specific gas drainage drilling services utilising the latest equipment and technology...|$|R
