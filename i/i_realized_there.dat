500|$|The band {{took the}} {{approach}} of recording one song at a time, and agreed with O'Brien to mix the songs as each one was finished. O'Brien had the band members set up {{much as they do}} live, and most of the songs were developed out of jam sessions. Guitarist Stone Gossard said, [...] "I think we allowed things to develop in a more natural, band-oriented sort of way, rather than me bringing in a bunch of stuff that was already arranged." [...] Gossard added that most of the songs were arranged once Vedder joined in and started singing, elaborating, [...] "You could tell when the music wanted to change just by the way he was singing." [...] In a 2009 interview, Gossard stated, [...] " [...] was probably where it felt better recording wise. I saw how it could change and evolve which gave me a lot of inspiration to go we can do ballads, we can do fast stuff, we can do slow stuff, we can do punk stuff. That was where <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>there</b> were gonna be a lot of places to go with Ed." ...|$|E
500|$|Possessing a {{mezzo-soprano}} vocal range, Madonna {{has always}} been self-conscious about her voice, especially in comparison to her vocal idols such as Ella Fitzgerald, Prince, and Chaka Khan. Mark Bego, author of Madonna: Blonde Ambition, called her [...] "the perfect vocalist for lighter-than-air songs", despite not being a [...] "heavyweight talent." [...] According to MSNBC critic Tony Sclafani, [...] "Madonna's vocals {{are the key to}} her rock roots. Pop vocalists usually sing songs [...] "straight," [...] but Madonna employs subtext, irony, aggression and all sorts of vocal idiosyncrasies in the ways John Lennon and Bob Dylan did." [...] Madonna used a bright, girlish vocal timbre in her early albums which became passé in her later works. The change was deliberate since she was constantly reminded of how the critics had once labelled her as [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium". During the filming of Evita, Madonna had to take vocal lessons, which increased her range further. Of this experience she commented, [...] "I studied with a vocal coach for Evita and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>there</b> was a whole piece of my voice I wasn't using. Before, I just believed I had a really limited range and was going {{to make the most of}} it." ...|$|E

This approach is entirely new and appropriately academic. It is specially designed for our culture...|$|R
500|$|In {{previous}} films, Starfleet's {{range of}} capital ships had been predominantly {{represented by the}} Constitution class Enterprise and just five other ship classes: the Miranda class from [...] (represented by the USS Reliant), the Excelsior and the Oberth class Grissom from , and the Galaxy and Nebula classes from The Next Generation. ILM supervisor John Knoll insisted that First Contacts space battle prove the breadth of Starfleet's ship configurations. [...] "Starfleet would probably throw everything it could at the Borg, including ships we've never seen before", he reasoned. [...] "And since we figured {{a lot of the}} background action in the space battle would need to be done with computer-generated ships that needed to be built from scratch anyway, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>there</b> was no reason not to do some new designs." [...] Alex Jaeger was appointed visual effects art director to the film and assigned the task of creating four new starships. Paramount wanted ships that would look different from a distance, so the director devised multiple hull profiles. Knoll and Jaeger had decided that the ships had to obey certain Star Trek ship precedents, with a saucer-like primary hull and elongated warp nacelles in pairs. The Akira class featured the traditional saucer section and nacelles combined with a catamaran-style double hull; the Norway class was based on the USS Voyager; the Saber class was a smaller ship with nacelles trailing off the tips of its saucer section; and the Steamrunner class featured twin nacelles trailing off the saucer and connected by an engineering section in the rear. Each design was modeled as a three-dimensional digital wire-frame model for use in the film.|$|E

I wrote the letters and stuff and I kind of just started writing there on my down time. At lunch when I {{had nothing to do}} I would write about stuff. I didn’t think it would become anything. It was just stupid fun and then, it was about {{six months to a year}} later when <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>there</b> were people reading it and that's when I had to decide where I was going to go with it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Jets' postgame press conference, Sanchez explained: [...] "I was {{thinking}} a different play in my head. That was a mental error there. As soon as <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>there</b> {{was no one}} to hand it to I started to run toward the line and tried to cover it up and just get down and I slid right into Brandon Moore." [...] "I was just trying to get down. The play was over. Say 'Uncle'. Do the right thing. Get to second-and-10 and live to play another down. I'm not a big believer in luck, but that was pretty unlucky. It was really too bad." [...] In an interview six days later, Sanchez described the play again: [...] "It's embarrassing. You screw up the play and I'm {{trying to do the right}} thing. It's not like I'm trying to force something. I start to slide and I slide in the worst spot I possibly could—right into Brandon Moore. I guess (I was) more stunned than anything. Just like a car accident. I was like, 'Whoa. What just happened?' Then, the ball's gone. It was weird." ...|$|E

5000|$|Journalist {{and author}} Mohammed Hanif, who became head of Urdu-language service at BBC, told American {{journalist}} Dexter Finkins that, {{while working in}} London after 1996, he [...] "became consumed" [...] with determining how Zia was killed. Hanif [...] "made phone calls and researched {{the lives of those}} around Zia", attempting to assess possible perpetrators—"the C.I.A., the Israelis, the Indians, the Soviets, rivals inside the Army". He stated he was [...] "met with silence". [...] "No one would talk—not Zia’s wife, not the Ambassador’s wife, no one in the Army.... <b>I</b> <b>realized,</b> <b>there’s</b> no way in hell I’ll ever find out." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{lyrics are}} unusual {{in that they}} do not rhyme. John Blackburn, the lyricist, has been quoted as saying, [...] "After {{completing}} the first 12 bars of the lyric, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>there</b> was no rhyme and then said to Karl, 'Let’s follow the pattern of no rhyme throughout the song. It seemed right.'" [...] The lyrics are also unconventional in that each verse (not counting the bridge) is a haiku.|$|E
500|$|The band {{immediately}} started {{to search for}} a replacement vocalist and found Howard Jones of Blood Has Been Shed. Jones disliked the band's sound when he first heard it. He commented, [...] "I was like, 'Meh.' I come from hardcore and dirtier metal, and Killswitch sounded so clean. But the more I listened to it, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>there's</b> some really good songs here". After hearing about Leach's vocal problems, Jones contacted the band and was accepted as the replacement. Philip Labonte of All That Remains tried out for lead vocals but lost to Jones, who had to quickly memorize seven songs for his debut at the 2002 Hellfest.|$|R

Even though I was incredibly tired, I {{got out of bed}} and walked around the house. After I went back to bed, I again heard the dog barking irregularly. I went out with my weapon and didn’t see anything. I kept walking around perimeter of my sheep pen, and noticed large metal wire-cutters. I panicked. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>there</b> were men around me." ...|$|E
5000|$|Writer and {{director}} Christopher MacBride {{said that a}} friend introduced him to conspiracy theories. According to him, [...] "For several months I got lost down that rabbit hole and eventually a light bulb just went off and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>there</b> was a really compelling story to tell set in that world." [...] The film makes use of both actors and real-life {{people involved in the}} conspiracy community. [...] MacBride said that he sees the film as an evenhanded faux documentary, not as [...] "found footage".|$|E

50|$|Besides Colby’s {{interesting}} thematic projects, Fruitlands bears smaller {{traces of}} her fingerprints: her {{obsession with the}} color blue, the quote she uses from {{one of my favorite}} Built to Spill songs (No one wants to hear / what you dreamt about / unless you dreamt about / them), her references to Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruno Schulz.

I wanted to {{capture the essence of}} Maine people's genuineness - down-to-earth, good-natured people - and work in the accent. I heard from displaced New Englanders. I got E-mails from people who said how dead-on the accent was and how dead wrong. It's tricky working phonetically because you still have to be legible, finding the balance of how far to take it. It's set in Whatchacallit, Maine. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>there</b> had never been this setting in comics. I hate following. More fun blazing a new trail. Nobody's ever been to Maine in the comics.|$|E

And when I lived in Alaska, I would go way out in the country, hiking and mountain climbing, and I would see these pieces of machinery way the heck back there, powered by wind or by water coming off the side of a mountain.

I picture my adversary as a young Stevie Nicks, but with long black hair, who shows up, woos everybody and freaks me out, until <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>there</b> is something <b>I</b> can do - then I step up and make my own magic.
