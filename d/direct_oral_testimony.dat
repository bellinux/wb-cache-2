40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a pragmatic}} and innovative {{approach to the}} data analysis of <b>oral</b> <b>testimonies</b> when used within a methodological framework of Historiography. <b>Oral</b> <b>testimony</b> is increasingly perceived as an exciting research method within the nursing discipline. However, {{the availability of a}} clear method to guide the researcher in their analysis of <b>oral</b> <b>testimonies</b> as the primary data for a Historiography is limited. A practical approach to the interpretation of <b>oral</b> <b>testimony</b> is needed to ensure the continued and successful use of Historiography as a valued research methodology in nursing science. The primary discussion revolves around the explication of a four-stage method proposed as a pragmatic tool for the analysis of <b>oral</b> <b>testimonies.</b> Theoretical literature from the Historian, Paul Thompson and Pragmatist Philosopher, Richard Rorty is drawn upon to bring validity and reliability to the proposed method of analysis. This new technique can be easily used by nurses and many other disciplines in their efforts to efficiently analyse the qualitative data obtained from <b>oral</b> <b>testimonies...</b>|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the uses of <b>oral</b> <b>testimony</b> in writing about literacy in historical context, especially about the literacy traditions of populations “hid-den from history”—immigrants, refugees, and undocumented persons—who are entering U. S. schools and workplaces, and whose literacy histories may be unknown or lost. Drawing on testimonies collected from Laotian Hmong refugees, I offer the following propositions: First, that <b>oral</b> <b>testimonies</b> pro-vide information about literacy that may be unavailable in documentary records. Second, that <b>oral</b> <b>testimonies</b> may reveal deeply held values and atti-tudes about literacy that cannot be derived from the documentary evidence. Third, that <b>oral</b> <b>testimonies</b> disclose {{the full range of}} human experience, rational and emotional, and that this may lead to new understandings of lit-eracy. Finally, that oral histories invite collaboration between researcher and informant in writing new histories of literacy—though not always in ways commonly assumed...|$|R

40|$|The present article {{endeavors to}} examine {{narratives}} of virginity {{as they have}} been viewed by some contemporary literary trends and to conceptualize, articulate and interpret <b>oral</b> <b>testimonies</b> elicited from Greek-Australian women across three generations. These <b>oral</b> <b>testimonies</b> encompassed and redefined a view of virginity - and the sequence of three intergenerational women affirms that its significance is waning - as a gradual evolution, transformation or even rejection of the concept. In literature, virginity has been presented antithetically as both anatomical and ideological, real and imagined, private and social/public, prestigious and as an obstacle, sacred and profance as well as a commodity and artifact. <b>Oral</b> <b>testimonies,</b> on the other hand, have the ability to reveal hidden realities of the individual self and to incorporate a novel variety of experiences and perspectives to this subject matter. As an epithet the word "virgin" means the unknown, the unattached, the unspoiled and the pure; as a noun "virginity" means an intact hymen and the absence of sexual intercourse between male and female. In this article the discussion is limited to this framework and won't extend to other connotations and subdivisions of the term. 22 page(s...|$|R
