5|$|Beyoncé Knowles is {{not worried}} chasing fads, though she <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of them. Over the years, {{she has learned}} how to harness them so {{effortlessly}} that they seem like her ideas. Take the standout track on her new album, 4, 'I Miss You', a slow-burn jam of desire co-written by Odd Future-affiliated crooner Frank Ocean. In its beginning moments, the song draws on the sparse wave of recent music by British band The xx by using silence as a weapon, a notion that extends across the 12-song album.|$|E
25|$|In June 1986 Mehmet and Ali start a cab {{firm called}} 'OzCabs' from a corner table in Ali's Café. Mehmet is married with three children, but monogamy is one {{sanctity}} of marriage {{that he is}} {{more than willing to}} overlook. Later that month punk Mary Smith (Linda Davidson) catches his eye, and so he bets his sceptical brother £10 that he can get Mary to have sex with him. Mary <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> that Mehmet's intentions are dishonourable and initially refuses to have sex with him, but Mehmet persists and she finally relents and spends the night with him. A triumphant Mehmet then collects his winnings and gloats to his brother in the café. However, Mary overhears their entire conversation and she then sets about trying to get revenge on him by hoax calling his cab-firm and vandalising his car. Later in the year Mehmet acts as Pat Wicks's (Pam St. Clement) pimp, setting her up with clients on a regular basis and he even persuades Pat to convince Mary to go prostitute herself too. He also gets involved in Kathy Beale's (Gillian Taylforth) Knitting business, later conning her and disappearing with all her profits. After he gets into more trouble with his customers for overcharging on fares and then trying to seduce Hannah Carpenter (Sally Sagoe) — the wife of his employee — the residents of Albert Square decide to confront him. Den Watts (Leslie Grantham), Pete Beale (Peter Dean) and Tony Carpenter (Oscar James) find him and give him a severe beating which involves having his arms pinned behind his back whilst taking a number of blows to the stomach.|$|E

[...] Geller called the last chapter, relating biology to sociology, a [...] "step from scientific study to speculation".

500|$|According to {{lead singer}} Mark Hall, [...] "If We Are the Body" [...] was {{originally}} written {{for use as}} a [...] "teaching tool" [...] in his youth group. Hall, a youth pastor, said that [...] " [...] forgotten what the body of Christ looked like" [...] and commented that [...] "The world <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of what the church is against, but they aren’t always aware of what it’s for. Everybody in the body of Christ is given gifts to minister with; and when Christians aren’t using these gifts, the body suffers". Hall's inspiration for writing the song came from the second chapter of the book of James, where the writer [...] "admonishes" [...] readers to [...] "steer clear of giving preferential treatment to any one particular group over another, such as favoring the rich over the poor".|$|E
500|$|Cher's {{public image}} is also {{reflected}} in her music videos and live performances, in which she [...] "repeatedly comments on her own construction, on her search for perfection and {{on the performance of}} the female body", wrote Tasker. Unlike other music video and stage acts of that time who often featured female backers who would mimic the singer's performance, Cher uses a male dancer dressed as her in the 1992 concert video Cher at the Mirage; Author Diane Negra commented, [...] "In authorizing her own quotation, Cher acknowledges herself as fictionalized production, and proffers to her audience a pleasurable plurality." [...] James Sullivan of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that [...] "Cher <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> that her chameleonic glitz {{set the stage for the}} current era of stadium-size razzle-dazzle. She's comfortable enough to see such imitation as flattery, not theft." ...|$|E
500|$|Bart's rebellious {{attitude}} {{has made him}} a disruptive student at Springfield Elementary School, where Bart is an underachiever and proud of it. He is constantly at odds with his teacher Ms. Krabappel, Principal Skinner, and occasionally Groundskeeper Willie. Bart does poorly in school and <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of it, having once declared, [...] "I am dumb, okay? Dumb as a post! Think I'm happy about it?" [...] On one occasion, Lisa successfully proves that Bart is dumber than a hamster, although Bart ultimately outsmarts her in the end. In [...] "Separate Vocations" [...] (season three, 1992) Bart becomes hall monitor and his grades go up, suggesting that he struggles mainly because he does not pay attention, not because he is stupid. This idea is reinforced in [...] "Brother's Little Helper", (season eleven, 1999) in which it is revealed that Bart suffers from attention deficit disorder. His lack of smarts can also be attributed to the hereditary [...] "Simpson Gene", which affects the intelligence of most male members of the Simpson family. Although he gets into endless trouble and can be sadistic, shallow and selfish, Bart also exhibits many qualities of high integrity. He has, on a few occasions, helped Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel: In [...] "Sweet Seymour Skinner's Baadasssss Song" [...] (season five, 1994), Bart accidentally got Skinner fired and befriended him outside the school environment. Bart missed having Skinner as an adversary and got him rehired, knowing that this would mean that the two could no longer be friends.|$|E

500|$|... "Take Me Home" [...] was {{released}} by Polydor Records in the United Kingdom on August 13, 2001 and in the United States as an import. It {{was released}} as a legal digital download and an enhanced maxi CD single; both featured the Ellis-Bextor cover, B-side [...] "Sparkle" [...] and a Jewels & Stone remix, while the latter contained the song's music video for the song. The single was also pressed as an edition dubbed the [...] "Mixes & Remixes" [...] EP, released only in France. A 12-inch single was also pressed in the United Kingdom, with remixes. Two AllMusic writers reviewed the song. Upon its release as a single, Dean Carlson gave it a negative rating of {{one and a half}} star out of five, commenting: [...] " [...] Ellis Bextor <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of what's required for beating the likes of Victoria Beckham and Emma Bunton at their own game—simply take Cher's [...] "Take Me Home" [...] and add one disco beat circa ABBA's 'Fernando', being mindful to avoid its cocaine harmonies and the air of free love , techno-fy it with random fiddly bits, sing with the breathless detachment of someone getting a massage from a lumberjack, and chuck in some remixes just so everybody knows that you're not utterly out of step." [...] After its parent album's release, Kelvin Hayes denoted it as one of the album's strongest tracks, as did Toby Manning from Q. For Yahoo! Music, Gary Crossing wrote that the album [...] "start well with the song", while describing it as Spiller-esque. Betty Clarke of The Guardian regarded [...] "Take Me Home" [...] as a [...] "pleasant enough song", though she called the production and Ellis-Bextor's vocals [...] "more tired than sexy".|$|E

Irrespective of the theoretical merits of breaking up patients' expectations, it was clear that [...] "the Lacanian analyst never wants to 'shake up' the routine by keeping them for more rather than less time".|$|E

Unbiased opinion may have given the verdict against her last season when new arrivals set a very hot pace; but Evil Under the Sun will take a lot of beating now". After summarising the plot, the Mr. Disher concluded: [...] "Miss Christie casts the shadow of guilt upon first one and then another with such casual ease that it is difficult for the reader not to be led by the nose. Everybody <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> that any character most strongly indicated is not a likely criminal; yet this guiding principle is forgotten when Miss Christie persuades you that you are more discerning than you really are.

2500|$|In 1905, {{during a}} {{procession}} {{to celebrate the}} visit of the Prince of Wales at Calcutta, Jatin decides to draw {{the attention of the}} future Emperor on the behaviour of HM's English officers.

[...] Stopping beside the cab, Jatin asks the fellows to leave the ladies alone. In response to their cheeky provocation, Jatin rushes up to the roof and fells them with pure Bengali slaps till they drop on the ground. The show is not innocent. Jatin <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> that John Morley, the Secretary of State, receives regularly complaints about the English attitude towards Indian citizens, [...] "The use of rough language and pretty free use of whips and sticks, and brutalities of that sort..."

2500|$|Oyarsa listens {{carefully}} to Weston's speech and {{acknowledges that the}} scientist is acting {{out of a sense}} of duty to his species, and not mere greed. This renders him more mercifully disposed towards the scientist, who accepts that he may die while giving Man the means to continue. However, on closer examination Oyarsa points out that Weston's loyalty is not to Man's mind – or he would equally value the intelligent alien minds already inhabiting Malacandra, instead of seeking to displace them in favour of humanity; nor to Man's body – since, as Weston <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of and at ease with, Man's physical form will alter over time, and indeed would have to in order to adapt to Weston's programme of space exploration and colonisation. It seems then that Weston is loyal only to [...] "the seed" [...] – Man's genome – which he seeks to propagate. When Oyarsa questions why this is an intelligible motivation for action, Weston's eloquence fails him and he can only articulate that if Oyarsa does not understand Man's basic loyalty to Man then he, Weston, cannot possibly instruct him.|$|E

Their lavish lifestyle is enviable worldwide. At film's end he tells her the songs were all about her - [...] "not all" [...] she corrects - but enough of them.

2500|$|Religious {{themes are}} also {{prevalent}} in this sonnet. The sonnets {{were published in}} 1609, composed {{during the reign of}} Queen Elizabeth I, who re-instituted The Anglican Church in England. One of the tenets of Protestantism was the belief that Catholic practices of worshiping the multitude of Saints and the Virgin Mary were practices of idolatry and were henceforth blasphemous. Hence, Shakespeare's claim against idolatry indicates his love is always directed at the same youth. Other interpretations make the claim that the religious nature of the poem is ironic, that Shakespeare <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> that the love he describes is indeed idolatry. Scholar Jane Roessner states that [...] "the speaker seems done with all efforts to persuade; now the sonnets are set up at once to deceive and reveal: to appear to be genuine praises ... while in fact covertly revealing the corruption of the friend, and ultimately, of the sonnets themselves which had at first seemed to be stays against corruption". Thus, the purpose behind the sonnet is one of intentional double-standards. In addition, Shakespeare is playing with the religious perversity, using the Christian imagery as a way of describing his love.|$|E
2500|$|Published {{as one of}} {{four stories}} (78 pages {{out of a total}} 239), [...] "The Bab Deception" [...] in The Hidden Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by non-Bahá'í William [...] "Bill" [...] Paxton (not the actor Bill Paxton) was {{published}} in 2000-1. A published synopsis: Set in August, 1896, Sherlock Holmes expounds at great length on his occult beliefs and invites Watson to a (spiritualism based) séance. Lestrade & Macintosh take Holmes & Watson to the home of Sir Randolph Gretzinger, former Ambassador to Persia, who has been murdered along with his servant. Holmes finds a copy of the Bayán in Gretzinger's hand, and he expounds at length on Bábism. Side note: Holmes is presented as having a high regard for the religion and being current on its situation enough to know that [...] "Abo ol-Baha" [...] is a political prisoner at that time and knowing full well that the religion would never associate with such a plot having already suffered many martyrs and known to not organize any rebellion and instead maintained a peaceful, unified vision with all mankind. He deduces that the men have been injected with poison (from small wounds in their thumbs), and expounds at length on snake venom. The following day they are summoned to the Diogenes Club, where Mycroft expounds at great length on the politics of petroleum and how this may be the true reason for the murder. After visiting the dead man's widow and urging her to continue his oil negotiations with the Shah of Persia Holmes is visited by representatives of the Bahá'í Faith who fear that the book was planted on the body to implicate them. They expound at length on the assassination of the last Shah and feel an effort is being made to frame them, but Holmes assures them he <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>aware</b> of the reputation of the Bahá'ís and believes in their innocence. Holmes & Watson are invited to a séance and Holmes expounds at length on the other guests. At the séance a spirit claiming to be Moriarty hurls a dagger at Holmes. Holmes organizes London Baha'is into a [...] "Baker Street Baha'i", including ones in the Russian Embassy, to locate Gretzinger's missing appointment book from which Holmes is able to learn the murderer's name and establish the innocence of the Bahá'ís.|$|E
