Cook, who had worked on previous halftime shows, understood the details and guided the team.

Although Cook learned during the game that the New England Patriots were scheduled to exit on the route used by volunteers carrying the stage equipment, he resolved the <b>issue</b> <b>by</b> talking with the team.|$|E

5|$|Klaus Dodds {{has noted}} {{that there is a}} geopolitical aspect to the {{locations}} used, although this is often a pre-emption of an <b>issue</b> <b>by</b> the film.
