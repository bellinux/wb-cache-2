25|$|In {{the wake}} of Lam Son 719, Silver Buckle, and Desert Rat, the PAVN {{extended}} its territory westward into Laos toward the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thailand</b> to better defend the Trail.

25|$|Campaign Z was {{notable for}} {{escalations}} of the Laotian Civil War conflict. The Vietnamese Communists brought 130mm field guns and T-34 tanks into action in Laos {{for the first}} time. The Vietnamese People's Air Force also launched MiG 21 attacks into Lao air space to challenge the Royalist side's air supremacy. On its side, the Royal Lao Government and its Central Intelligence Agency backers imported copious numbers of mercenaries from the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thailand</b> as reinforcements, and depended on American air power support, including Arc Light strikes by B-52 Stratofortresses. An independent Laos would narrowly survive Campaign Z.|$|E
25|$|The 1973 Laotian coup was a final {{attempt to}} stave off a {{communist}} coalition government of the Kingdom of Laos. Exiled General Thao Ma returned from the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thailand</b> on 20 August 1973 to take over Wattay International Airport outside the capital of Vientiane. Commandeering an AT-28, he led air strikes upon the office and home of his hated rival, General Kouprasith Abhay. While Thao Ma was unsuccessfully bombing Kouprasith, loyal Royalist troops retook the airfield. Shot down upon his return, Thao Ma was hauled from his airplane's wreckage and executed. The coalition agreement was signed 14 September 1973.|$|E
25|$|He {{would play}} a similar role {{following}} the Battle of Luang Namtha. On 8 May 1962, he joined the routed RLA troops that had just fled Luang Namtha for Ban Houayxay. Sourith ordered the local ammunition dump blown up to prevent its capture by communist troops. The already demoralized Royalist soldiers panicked; some of them fled further south, into the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thailand.</b> The senior American military adviser from the U.S. Embassy, which was supporting the RLA, concluded that the Royalist army completely lacked the urge for combat. However, Sourith continued command of Military Region 1 despite the defeat.|$|E

From 1955 to 1958, the U.S. would sink $202 million into Laos. This aid led to corruption as it was siphoned off by recipients.|$|E
25|$|On 28 October, the two PAVN columns {{launched}} their attacks. In {{the wake of}} the defections, the PL contributed just three companies to the offensive. The Royal Lao Army (RLA) struggled to resist, fielding the 21st Brigade from Thakhek. Bataillon Infanterie 233 (BI 233) and two SPECOM teams were rushed north from Savannakhet to aid in the resistance. Despite their efforts, the PAVN probes neared the Mekong River, essentially cutting Laos in two while threatening the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thailand.</b> One of the Communist columns threatened Thakhek.

25|$|Operation Millpond, which {{operated}} from 13 March 1961 through August 1961, was an American covert operation {{designed to}} introduce air power into the Laotian Civil War.

The B-26s were returned to Okinawa. However, the precedent had been set for covert Central Intelligence Agency-sponsored air operations in Laos.|$|E

25|$|France–Thailand {{relations}} cover {{a period}} from the 16th century until modern times. Relations started in earnest {{during the reign}} of Louis XIV of France with numerous reciprocal embassies and a major attempt by France to Christianize the <b>kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thailand</b> (then known as Siam) and establish a French protectorate, which failed when the country revolted against foreign intrusions in 1688. France would only return more than {{a century and a half}} later as a modernised colonial power, engaging in a struggle for territory and influence against Thailand in mainland Southeast Asia that would last until the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Assigned to the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thailand</b> on 1 March 1951, Lair {{found himself}} {{training}} Border Patrol Police to Special Forces standards.

Acting in response to the Kong Le coup of 9 August 1960, Lair's unit secretively supplied the communications liaisons needed for the successful counter-coup of 14 December 1960. Once established within Laos, Lair promptly searched out Vang Pao. With Lair's aid, Vang Pao raised an army of 30,000 guerrilla warriors to fight in the Laotian Civil War.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Thailand</b> {{occupied}} a delicate position during the Second Indochina War. The Kingdom of Laos was a buffer between the Peoples Republic of China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Thailand, and their possible {{domination of the}} Thais. Laos {{also served as a}} buffer from the fighting in the Vietnam War. However, the Thai–Lao border of the Mekong River was easily breached. As a result, there was a consensus among Thais that communist encroachment should be stopped short of Thai territory. As an open effort would attract Chinese attention, the Thai government elected covert participation in the ongoing Laotian Civil War. The Police Aerial Reinforcement Unit (PARU) of the Border Patrol Police (BPP) became the liaison agents for that.|$|E
25|$|Southern Thailand was {{the centre}} of Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism. The Tang monk Yijing stopped at Langkasuka to study Pali grammar and Mahayana during his journey to India around 800.
