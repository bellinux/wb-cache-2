5|$|A pulmonic {{consonant}} is a consonant made by obstructing the glottis (the {{space between}} the vocal cords) or oral cavity (the mouth) and either simultaneously or subsequently letting out air from the lungs. Pulmonic consonants make {{up the majority of}} consonants in the IPA, as well as in human language. All consonants in the English language fall <b>into</b> <b>this</b> <b>category.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} wild mammalians {{may be found}} in Canadian {{territory}} without being confirmed natives. Some were voluntarily or involuntarily introduced. These include the house mouse (Mus musculus), and Norway and black rats (respectively Rattus norvegicus and R. rattus). Other include escaped animals; the Coypu (Myocastor coypus), European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and Hares (Lepus europaeus), as well as feral cats, dogs and horses fall <b>into</b> <b>this</b> <b>category.</b> Fallow deers (Dama dama) and wild boars (Sus scrofa) were introduced for hunting.|$|E
5|$|In {{homodyne}} detection, {{the interference}} occurs between two beams {{at the same}} wavelength (or carrier frequency). The phase {{difference between the two}} beams results in a change in the intensity of the light on the detector. The resulting intensity of the light after mixing of these two beams is measured, or the pattern of interference fringes is viewed or recorded. Most of the interferometers discussed in this article fall <b>into</b> <b>this</b> <b>category.</b>|$|E

5|$|These {{additional}} {{revenues were}} expected, {{when combined with}} spending cuts including a reduction of $200 million in higher education spending, to meet the state's balanced-budget requirement. A clause was also inserted into the budget cutting state aid for schools that hold over $1 billion in endowments. The only school in New Jersey that fell <b>into</b> <b>this</b> <b>category</b> was Princeton University, which had an endowment with assets over $11 billion in 2006. The university that had the largest endowment next to Princeton {{at the time was}} Drew University which had a $225 million endowment fund.|$|E
5|$|Two {{species are}} IUCN Vulnerable: the desert {{tortoise}} (California and Nevada) and the gopher tortoise (Georgia, also the official tortoise of Florida). Three species are Near Threatened: the diamondback terrapin (Maryland), the ornate box turtle (Kansas), {{and the common}} box turtle (Missouri with the three-toed subspecies, North Carolina and Tennessee with the eastern subspecies). All the remaining state reptile species are Least Concern. Interestingly, all the non-turtle reptiles fall <b>into</b> <b>this</b> <b>category,</b> but the only two turtles in relative safety are the common snapping turtle (New York) and the painted turtle (Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, Vermont).|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, {{only the}} Saint Thomas Creek, the City Mills River and the Channelsea River {{were still being}} used for {{commercial}} traffic. A section of the Channelsea River between Stratford High Street and Lett Road was culverted between 1957 and 1958. As traffic ceased, the lock structures deteriorated, and by 2006, City Mills Lock and Carpenters Road Lock were officially disused. The 1968 British Waterways Act had classified most waterways into commercial, cruising and remainder waterways. Remainder waterways were those for which {{the government of the}} time could see no economic future, and which would only therefore be subject to maintenance to prevent them becoming unsafe. The Bow Back Rivers fell <b>into</b> <b>this</b> <b>category,</b> and remained neglected until their full restoration was enshrined in a British Waterways policy document in 2002.|$|E
50|$|Viking coins {{fit well}} <b>into</b> <b>this</b> latter <b>category,</b> but {{nonetheless}} form a separate category of Viking period artefact, their design and decoration largely {{independent of the}} developing styles characteristic of wider Viking artistic endeavour.|$|R
50|$|The Canon PowerShot G3 X {{is a large}} sensor digital bridge camera {{announced}} by Canon on June 18, 2015. It marks Canon's entry <b>into</b> <b>this</b> product <b>category,</b> alongside competitors such as the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ1000, Sony Cyber-shot RX10 and RX10 II.|$|R
5000|$|The WDSF {{formerly}} prohibited {{its members}} {{from participating in}} any competition that is not listed and registered by either WDSF or a WDSF National Member Body. WDC competitions fall <b>into</b> <b>this</b> prohibited <b>category.</b> <b>This</b> policy was revoked in 2012 at the Annual Meeting by vote of the members. The WDSF now supports an athletes [...] "right to dance".|$|R
5|$|Enzymes with single-substrate {{mechanisms}} include isomerases such as triosephosphateisomerase or bisphosphoglycerate mutase, intramolecular lyases such as {{adenylate cyclase}} and the hammerhead ribozyme, an RNA lyase. However, some enzymes that {{only have a}} single substrate do not fall <b>into</b> <b>this</b> <b>category</b> of mechanisms. Catalase {{is an example of}} this, as the enzyme reacts with a first molecule of hydrogen peroxide substrate, becomes oxidised and is then reduced by a second molecule of substrate. Although a single substrate is involved, the existence of a modified enzyme intermediate means that the mechanism of catalase is actually a ping–pong mechanism, a type of mechanism that is discussed in the Multi-substrate reactions section below.|$|E
5|$|In parody masses, {{the source}} {{material}} {{was not a}} single line, but an entire texture, often of a popular song. Several works by Josquin fall loosely <b>into</b> <b>this</b> <b>category,</b> including the Missa Fortuna desperata, based on the three-voice song Fortuna desperata (possibly by Antoine Busnois); the Missa Malheur me bat (based on a chanson variously ascribed to Obrecht, Ockeghem, or, most likely, Abertijne Malcourt); and the Missa Mater Patris, based on a three-voice motet by Antoine Brumel. The Missa Mater Patris is probably the first true parody mass to be composed, for it no longer contains any hint of a cantus firmus. Parody technique was to become the most usual means of mass composition {{for the remainder of the}} 16th century, although the mass gradually fell out of favor as the motet grew in esteem.|$|E
5|$|The caboclos {{formed the}} {{majority}} of the population in the Northern, Northeastern and Central-Western regions. A large mulatto population inhabited the eastern coast of the northeastern region from Bahia to Paraíba and were also present in northern Maranhão, southern Minas Gerais, eastern Rio de Janeiro and in Espírito Santo. The cafuzos were the smallest and most difficult to distinguish from the two other mixed-race subgroups since the descendants of caboclos and mulattoes also fell <b>into</b> <b>this</b> <b>category</b> and were found in the northeast sertão (English: hinterland). These groups may still be found in the same areas today.|$|E
5000|$|Websites {{that offer}} [...] "user-created" [...] tablature, but have {{obtained}} the proper legal clearances to post these transcriptions on-line. There are several websites that fall <b>into</b> <b>this</b> second <b>category,</b> which {{generally do not}} charge consumers for using these user-created tablature pieces, and share any advertising revenue with music publishers and/or songwriters.|$|R
50|$|A mobile {{billboard}} is {{a device}} used for advertising {{on the side}} of a truck or trailer that is typically mobile. Mobile billboards are a form of out-of-home advertising (OOH); radio, static billboards, and mall/airport advertising fall <b>into</b> <b>this</b> same <b>category.</b> Using a mobile billboard for advertising is an advertising niche called mobile outdoor advertising.|$|R
40|$|The NIH (Not Invented Here) {{syndrome}} often {{appears in}} software development; {{it makes people}} keep reinventing the wheel all the time. Fortunately the recent trend is to reuse existing solutions either as software component or as known designs. Patterns fall <b>into</b> <b>this</b> latter <b>category.</b> Patterns are reusable solution to known problems in a well-defined context [2]...|$|R
5|$|A few {{theoretical}} physicists {{have argued}} that classical physics is intrinsically incapable of explaining the holistic aspects of consciousness, but that quantum theory may provide the missing ingredients. Several theorists have therefore proposed quantum mind (QM) theories of consciousness. Notable theories falling <b>into</b> <b>this</b> <b>category</b> include the holonomic brain theory of Karl Pribram and David Bohm, and the Orch-OR theory formulated by Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose. Some of these QM theories offer descriptions of phenomenal consciousness, as well as QM interpretations of access consciousness. None of the quantum mechanical theories has been confirmed by experiment. Recent publications by G. Guerreshi, J. Cia, S. Popescu, and H. Briegel could falsify proposals {{such as those of}} Hameroff, which rely on quantum entanglement in protein. At the present time many scientists and philosophers consider the arguments for an important role of quantum phenomena to be unconvincing.|$|E

5000|$|Faith's use of arch form or [...] "coming full circle" [...] {{reflects}} {{the influence of}} Brahms, whose many songs fall <b>into</b> <b>this</b> structural <b>category.</b> He may end with a literal repeat, a transposed portion, or only a fragment of A, and may repeat text, music, or both in the process. Arch form is also reflected {{in the use of}} dynamics. Many songs begin quietly, reach a climax in an interior section, and then end as they began.|$|R
50|$|It {{is unusual}} for a {{memorial}} runestone to be dedicated to a woman, and even more {{unusual for a}} memorial to a woman be sponsored by a woman. A survey indicated that less than 1 per cent of all runestones fall <b>into</b> <b>this</b> later <b>category.</b> The husband of Gillaug is {{not mentioned in the}} inscription as a sponsor of the stone.

IBM Information Server’s architecture meets all of the criteria that define it as an integrated software platform for information integration, and certainly establishes a functional benchmark for other vendors looking to say they have an information server too.|$|R
50|$|A {{per unit}} tax, or {{specific}} tax, {{is a tax}} that {{is defined as a}} fixed amount for each unit of a good or service sold, such as cents per kilogram. It is thus proportional to the particular quantity of a product sold, regardless of its price. Excise taxes, for instance, fall <b>into</b> <b>this</b> tax <b>category.</b> By contrast, an ad valorem tax is a charge based on a fixed percentage of the product value. Per unit taxes have administrative advantages when it is easy to measure quantities of the product or service being sold.|$|R
