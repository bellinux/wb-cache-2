To handle software requirements for a new <b>IT-tool</b> we chose use cases, a software engineering technique for requirements documentation, and adopted it to our specific needs. Use cases have a number of well known weaknesses like feature interactions and early focus on human-machine interaction. We varied this technique by extracting commonalities and giving additional context information. Further, we kept requirements descriptions abstract with respect to the concrete software environments used by different development projects. Our experiences were positive. The only disadvantage of our approach was the effort needed to create structured lists of requirements for management reports...|$|E

40|$|A central {{challenge}} for todays factory planning is {{the management of}} complexity - the complexity of production processes and structures and their interdependencies. In an increasingly dynamic and competitive environment, factory planning is becoming a more and more crucial core process for production industries. In the context of increasing planning frequency and tighter time limits, available planning procedures and systems do support the design of production processes and structures only fragmentarily. Especially for early planning phases, a comprehensive and consistent approach towards systematic design of processes and structures involving discreet event simulation and virtual reality is not available. Hence, it was the task of this thesis to develop a methodology for integrated rough design of processes and structures with digital factory models. With application of model theory and systems engineering, a methodology was developed which consists of three components: i) an object-oriented reference model for the integrated modelling of process and structures within production, ii) a design procedure based on eight object-related design elements and iii) an integrated <b>IT-tool</b> which represents the implementation of model and procedure and combines realistic 3 D-visualisation with discreet event simulation. For {{the development of the}} methodology, a systematic approach towards integration of process- and structure-design was applied. Starting with the relations between processes and structures on the object-level, integration was transferred to the design level. In four consecutive steps, starting with the reference model via the design procedure it was implemented into the <b>IT-tool</b> indyGO. This tool is based on the connection of the Factory Planning Table by Fraunhofer IPA (used as a front end for layout planning) with the Simulation Tool-Kit of WZL (for dynamic evaluation). It supports quick and efficient design and evaluation of alternative factory scenarios for interdisciplinary design teams. In an industrial case study, the methodology was tested. Its applicability is shown by the planning results: both, an efficient and quick planning process as well as improved planning results - a flexible an productive factory department for gear parts...|$|E

40|$|The {{large size}} of the Japanese IT market makes it {{attractive}} to and important for foreign high technology companies. However, the Japanese market is very challenging, highly competitive, and difficult to penetrate for foreign {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs). Most SMEs fail to penetrate into the Japanese market effectively by using modern <b>IT-tools</b> in the international subsidiary establishment process. No earlier in-depth empirical research exists on the IT-supported international subsidiary establishment process for this market. This study investigated and analyzed how a Finnish high technology SME implemented the ITsupported international subsidiary establishment process for the Japanese market. In this study, a case study method was used to execute the research. This study validated and refined a conceptual model of the ITsupported international subsidiary establishment process by using empirical data. The research findings revealed that by using various <b>IT-tools</b> high technology companies can improve their internationalization process, penetrate the Japanese market rapidly and effectively, and manage global information exchange. This study also demonstrates that the use of <b>IT-tools</b> in the international subsidiary establishment process includes some limitations and not all tasks can be performed using ITtools alone.

The purpose with this study is to investigate teachers uptake, how they use the tablet in everyday pedagogy work as well as the organizational conditions that that facilitate and hinders. Through my observations and interviews in a Swedish K- 5 school I have found that the teachers find tablets more appealing to use in comparison to computers. These findings are partly supported by Davis et al. ’s (1989) TAM-theory who considers there to be three types of aspects that affect the way individuals adapt to technology. Firstly the teachers’ motivation increased when they saw the usefulness in the tablet in both educational and administrative possibilities. Secondly, the tablet is perceived as an ease of use-artifact which in it self gives the teachers incentive for usage. Thirdly, the infrastructure problem that exists around computers creates an escape to the more appealing tablets. ...|$|E

Typical processes and decision steps were mapped using real life production scenarios of participating food companies manufacturing complex ready-to-eat foods. Companies looked for a more integrated approach when making food safety decisions that would align with existing HACCP systems. The tool was designed with shelf life assessments and data on safety, quality, and costs, using a pasta salad meal as a case product. The process flow chart was used as starting point, with simulation options at each process step. Key parameters like pH, water activity, costs of ingredients and salaries, and default models for calculations of Listeria monocytogenes, quality scores, and vitamin C, were placed in an interactive database. Customization of the models and settings was possible on the user-interface. The simulation module outputs were provided as detailed curves or categorized as “good”; “sufficient”; or “corrective action needed” based on threshold limit values set by the user.

40|$|Patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) visit various {{healthcare}} providers {{during the course}} of their disease. It was suggested that IT might help to orchestrate their care provision. We have applied the USE <b>IT-tool</b> to get insight in the relevant problems, solutions and constraints of the MS-care and the MS care providers both in the organizational and the information technological area. There is hardly a chain of healthcare, but rather, a network in which informal communication plays an important role. This informal network worked reasonably effective, but inefficient and slow. The patient himself plays a key-role in information exchange between care-providers. Many providers were unaware of the services that other {{healthcare providers}} could give in general or did provide to a specific patient. MS patients-count is only small for most care providers. None of the interviewed patients mentioned a lack of contacts between care-providers as a problem. They thought that lack of experience caused their major problems: insufficient and inadequate care. To improve care, we proposed a solution that combines a “short MS-protocol”, the introduction of a central coordinator of care and a Patient Relation Management (PRM) System. This is a simple web-based application that is based on agreement by the caregivers that supports routing, tracking and tracing of a MS patient and supplies the caregivers with professional guidelines, as written down in the protocol. It is likely that we would have suggested a far more complicated ICT solution if we had only analyzed the MS-care process as such, without specific consideration of the USE IT dimensions. 1...|$|E

This study also introduces how case company Kela have performed this combination. In addition, this study gives further information regarding whether the benchmarked companies are combining appraisal and payment determination processes, and what are their experiences regarding the combination / non-combination, as well as how their IT-tools support these processes. Academic background and methodology: Earlier literature introduced in this study provides background information to the topic, including support and criticism regarding should payment be linked to performance. Methodology of this research is a case study. In addition, this research has also elements of Action Design Research (Sein et al., 2011). Qualitative empirical study includes benchmarking of four companies. Scope of the benchmark study is companies who are utilizing SAP in performance appraisal or who have experience in combining the performance appraisal and payment determination processes. Findings and conclusions: There exists both support and criticism regarding should payment be linked to performance. Psychological and economic theories supporting the linkage of performance and payment imply that combining payment and performance would enhance the individual employees' performance. According to critics, payment is not the main motivator for employees, but job satisfaction can be derived from eg. responsibility, recognition or optimal amount of challenges. It seems that no single truth is available to the questions whether pay should be linked to performance. In addition, it seems that linking pay to performance in public sector is more challenging than in private sector. Within the benchmarked companies, there exists more support for keeping payment and performance as separate process, including separate discussions...|$|E

The application has multiple areas of usage, including deviation handling, self-monitoring, QR-code, inspection and completion plans. The purpose of the study is to examine how effective BIM 360 Field is compared to the industry’s traditional way of handling deviations. This degree project is written in cooperation with Skanska Sverige AB and the project “J-huset” in Uppsala. The purpose is further to examine if BIM 360 Field can be applied and used for the inspection of “J-huset”. The study has been carried out through interviews with the production management on various projects. Interviews, as well as an introduction to the application, have been carried out with proficient staff from Skanska. A field study has been undertaken on the “J-huset” in Uppsala for the purpose of gaining a personal opinion as well as knowledge of the application.

40|$|For {{the regular}} {{assessment}} of technical risks during product development through interdisciplinary and locally devided project teams this thesis developed a procedure, which takes the high complexity and dynamic of development projects and the necessary iterations into account. On {{basis of the}} assessment results {{it is possible to}} install a goal oriented risk communication as a pre-condition for efficient and effective decision processes. In literature the technical risk management is supported by many approaches and methods from the field of quality and project management. But the known approaches for the assessment of risks, the risk communication and the project steering are insufficient. In many companies the consequences of these inadequacies of methods and means for the technical risk management are always reoccurring problems with irregular, partial and late risk assessments and their communication. As a result the project wide transparency of current risks is not sufficient and a preventive project steering has only limited effectiveness. Based on findings from system theory a risk information model was developed, oriented on the three fundamental systems of product development: the goal system, the action system, and the object system. The essential characteristic of the risk information model is its multiple level structure consisting of elements, main indicators, indicators, and criterions. The model contains beside the objects of assessment and the marks to classify the results also the results of assessment itself. This thesis describes a way to operationalize the risk information model and the belonging instruments to create the model specifically for each project. The developed risk information model facilitates an effective risk communication by analysing and compressing assessment results. The practical usability of the risk information model and the risk assessment procedure was shown on the one hand in the automobile industry developing a new brake system, on the other hand the risk assessment procedure was transferred to a parallel development of product and production in the industry of semi-conductors. In both practical examples could be proved that the instrument with its high transparency and its good information contributed {{to the success of the}} project. To increase the efficiency of risk assessment and communication an <b>IT-tool</b> was developed to define and assess indicators, to derive measures and to make reports...|$|E
40|$|While {{design and}} {{management}} of production systems based on digital models brings benefits, the communication of models comes with challenges since models typically reside in a distributed heterogeneous IT environment using different syntax and semantics. Coping with heterogeneity requires an appropriate integration strategy and methodology. One main paradigm to integrate information and consequently IT-systems is to deploy standardized information models. In particular, ISO 10303 STEP has been endorsed as a suitable standard to exchange {{a wide variety of}} product manufacturing data. The representation and integration of product, process and production resources information using different STEP application protocols are well covered and extensively investigated by many researchers. However, the information representation and integration of logical relations of material flow such as product routing, and its integration with factory layout information has been less subject of research focuses. Hence, this thesis first contributes to identifying, describing and clarifying information requirements for an integrated representation of material flow logic and plant layout using the STEP standard. One the other hand, service-oriented <b>IT-tool</b> integration solutions are increasingly deployed for the data and tool interoperability, especially with the evolution of Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) whose focus is on the linking of data from heterogeneous software tools. OSLC focuses on the integration of the most common concepts across domains. Assuming a loosely coupled distributed architecture of IT-tools and services, OSLC adopts the Linked Data (LD) approach to ensure data consistency across the data sources. Thus the thesis studies the use of OSLC for tool integration and has found that it cannot be practiced independently for all types of integration in the production engineering domain. Therefore, in practice, there should be a combination of the standardized information and linked data approaches to facilitate the integration process. Thus, this thesis investigates the integration applicability of linked data and OSLC, the principles behind them, and criteria to identify where to use which approach. In addition, the thesis explores the synergy between the standardized information and linked data approaches and consequently suggests an approach based on a combination of these. Further, different computer applications in industrial cases were implemented to verify the suggested approaches. Finally the thesis is concluded with a discussion and suggestions for future work.

40|$|The {{concept of}} the {{balanced}} scorecard was introduced by Harvard professors Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton in 1992 when organizations {{realized that it was}} no longer sustainable to focus only on financial objectives in order to stay competitive. The balanced scorecard was traditionally developed for use in for-profit organizations but with its fundamental idea that the financial perspective does not always cover what is most important, it has also been implemented in non-profit organizations where profit maximization is not the main objective. Although the balanced scorecard is presented to be an effective management system for survival in a more challenging and competing environment it has also been strongly criticized by several authors as well as organization that have unsuccessfully implemented it. Empirical studies evaluating this relatively new management control system are still rather limited, especially in non-profit organization which made us eager to look deeper into the effects of using the balanced scorecard and we identified a research problem; Is the balanced scorecard an effective management system that improves the performance of a local public administration in Northern Sweden? For this study we identified our alignment toward the positivistic scientific ideal. We have further chosen a deductive approach as the already existing theory of the balanced scorecard is the base of our research. We have used a qualitative research strategy where our empirics are based upon eleven semi-structured interviews with leaders in Skellefteå municipality where they have given their perception of the balanced scorecard and its influence on the organization management. Our main purpose has been to evaluate whether the usage of the balanced scorecard is improving the performance of Skellefteå municipality. In the process of evaluating our results it has been made evident that the management system is perceived as performance increasing even though areas of improvements do exists. One example of improvement could be to develop an <b>IT-tool</b> to facilitate the reporting of the balanced scorecard as it is at present experienced as a very time consuming process since it is manually completed.

40|$|An {{internal}} survey at Statistics Sweden in 2004 {{revealed that}} {{about one third}} of all resources among business surveys are spent on data editing. In order to analyse the possibility to reduce this proportion nine case studies were conducted on editing. The business surveys that spend most resources on editing and related processes, in absolute terms, {{were included in the}} study. The main purpose of the case studies was to learn about similarities and differences between the surveys with regard to editing. Knowledge and experiences gained from the study was meant for use for development of generic tools for editing. Efficient editing means that we, with a high hit rate, find data errors that have a noticeable or even decisive effect, on the statistics. A potential for efficiency gains showed to be present in seven surveys, ranging from about 25 to 50 percent. The expectations on generic tools for editing are that (1) fewer <b>IT-tools</b> means decreased system maintenance cost and (2) more flexible distribution of the work among the editing staff due to well-known interfaces. Efficient methods means (3) fewer records to follow-up by re-contacts and this, again, means (4) better work environment for editing staff, not having to re-contact respondents who have delivered correct data.

Supported by a questionnaire-based study with industrial partners as well as experience of many years in consulting companies, the Fraunhofer IPT generated {{a model of the}} historical development of technology intelligence. The aim is to explain the historical development of technology intelligence. Findings of this paper can be used by companies to classify their own technology intelligence status and identify which factors are relevant for this challenging task. Based on Gartner's Hype Cycle the model was adapted to the organizational task of technology intelligence and five phases of historical development were identified. The "Trigger" phase started in the mid 80 s, when technologies have been recognized as crucial strategic factors due to globalism and converging markets. Main tasks were manual searches of new technologies while a "big picture" of the company's environment and technological position was often missing. Expectations regarding technology intelligence rose steadily higher in the "Trigger" phase until reaching the phase "Peak of inflated expectations", where more resources were supplied and activities were centralized and more formalized. In addition to that the explosion of information led to a need of automation tools for the search. The third phase "Through of disillusionment" extenuated the exaggerated expectations about technology intelligence due to over-formalized tasks, too many undirected searches and intra-organizational communication problems. The current phase "Slope of enlightenment" is characterized by the development of advanced <b>IT-tools</b> for scanning, the strategic alignment of technology intelligence and the aim of increasing productivity and efficiency of technology intelligence. For reaching the last, future phaste "Plateau of productivity" further exploitation of <b>IT-tools</b> is predicted and establishing a culture of knowledge-sharing is recommended...|$|R

40|$|From {{the article}} The {{paradigm}} shift towards competency-based {{education in the}} Netherlands has a logical counterpart: {{the need for more}} flexibility in the curricula. After all, in competency-based education it is recognized that learning not only takes place in designated places (school, university), but may happen every time when the learner is confronted with a challenge.

40|$|Efficient and {{effective}} process management is considered as key success factor for competitiveness of enterprises {{in an increasingly}} complex and closely connected environment. Today, there exists a plentitude of <b>IT-tools</b> that support modeling, execution, monitoring, and even flexible change of processes. Though, most process management solutions offer possibilities for reusing workflow components, development of new process models is still a cost and time consuming task. Either common process knowledge is scattered among a growing amount of process models or it is divided into unspecific components, the interrelations of which are difficult to manage. This problem becomes even worse considering potential variations of workflows. In the SPOT project, we adapted the feature modeling approac h in order to represent enterprise-specific process knowledge {{in the form of}} process families. Process families consist of semantically enriched process fragments and enable the composition of business processes that conform to domain-related rules and regulations...|$|R
40|$|The {{losses from}} {{suboptimal}} interoperability in IT supported design, production, {{and operation of}} health care facilities are tantamount. In these years new built of hospitals in Scandinavia could be realized in a more efficient and innovative way if using information standards. This paper inquires into whether computerized information standards enable or constrain innovation in public procurement of buildings. In architectural and engineering design of public buildings the project based product development tends be done in constellations of firms in interorganisational contracting, which do not provide stability or room for innovation. A large hospital project was investigated through interviews, documents and observations. The effects of implementing building information standards are both inter- and intraorganisational. The building client claims to have saved money, through better structured building component data that gave considerable positive effects during tendering. The IT-suppliers develop <b>IT-tools,</b> and the AEC companies can commence develop services preparing for new markets...|$|R
