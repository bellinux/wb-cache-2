50|$|In {{an audio}} amplifier, {{all forms of}} {{oscillation}} are generally unwanted. Poor design and layout can sometimes lead to squegging in such an amplifier. As always, this arises {{from a combination of}} high and low frequency oscillations. Poor layout or poor shielding leads to high-frequency oscillations where the output has been coupled back to the input, especially if the <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> <b>cables</b> are run together for a distance. The high-frequency oscillations cause heavy currents in the output stages and, with poor power supply decoupling, these upset the input stage biasing and disrupt the high frequency oscillations. Squegging then arises. Squegging in audio amplifiers is commonly called motorboating because it sounds in the loudspeaker like an outboard boat motor at low speed.|$|R

The current flow in the substation is derived by commutation of rectifying blocks, which define current of transformers and DC part. For evaluating exists a semi empiric formula, that has a delimited relevance to small power range up to 50 kWatts of output power. New way of evaluation of short current is based on simulation of simplified substation model using the capabilities of DYNAST simulation program, or other dynamic equation solver based on numerical method, like Matlab...|$|R

Laspeyres, Paasche, Fisher Ideal, and Törnqvist-Theil index number procedures (base year 1949 = 100) were used to develop their estimates, the formulas for which are presented below and elaborated further in Alston, Norton, and Pardey (1995). An Excel spreadsheet file named accompanies these notes. It contains the price and quantity <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> aggregates for each of the 48 contiguous states, 11 USDA production regions (with the Northeast region split into two sub-regions), and a 48 -state (national) total for the period 1949 - 91. The data file also includes various <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> subaggregates (see table 1 from Acquaye, Alston, and Pardey, appended below, for details) and the value shares using prices from the current and past period that are required to reconstruct all these indexes for all the spatial units reported in the paper. Documentation of the primary data files constructed by Craig, Pardey, and Acquaye is also available in the file named Index Number Construction The Laspeyres and Paasche indexes are not chain-linked indexes—they use base-period and current prices and quantities, respectively in the calculation. The Laspeyres <b>input</b> (<b>output)</b> quantity index uses base period <b>input</b> (<b>output)</b> prices to weight both current and base-period <b>input</b> (<b>output)</b> quantities, and was calculated as where Pi 0 is the price of <b>input</b> (<b>output)</b> i in the base-period, and Qi 0 is the quantity of <b>input</b> (<b>output)</b> i in the base-period.

30|$|As a conclusion, our {{proposed}} approach {{suggests an}} efficient alternative procedure to estimate predicted intervals for FR model with fuzzy <b>input</b> and <b>output.</b> As {{a limitation of}} our study, we only focused on fuzzy regression model in the case that <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> {{are assumed to be}} symmetric or nonsymmetric triangular fuzzy numbers. Therefore, we only considered FRBF Network when <b>input,</b> <b>output</b> and weights are triangular fuzzy numbers and we did not consider another types of fuzzy numbers in this study. Although the discussion of this study is confined to simple regression with one <b>input</b> and one <b>output,</b> it can be generalized to cope with cases of multiple <b>inputs</b> and <b>outputs.</b> For future studies, more general fuzzy <b>inputs,</b> <b>outputs</b> and weights such as trapezoidal fuzzy numbers could be handled with our FRBF Network approach and it could be applied to different FR models.|$|R
