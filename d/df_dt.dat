It was {{concluded that there was}} no clear evidence as to how they correlated. In order to obtain a measure of the f 0 F 2 and TEC variability, the normalised differences df 0 F 2 and d TEC from the relevant monthly median values were also considered. Since no clear evidence could be obtained as of how df 0 F 2 and d TEC correlate, a new parameter, the ?Ap /?R ratio was tried. ?Ap was taken as the difference between the maximum value of Ap measured at the relevant disturbance and that corresponding {{at the beginning of the}} disturbance. ?R corresponded to the two above mentioned values of Ap.

We also propose its symmetric {{form in which}} the D (1) 4 -symmetries become clearly visible. 0. Statement of main results In [9, 10, 11], we presented some types of coupled Painlevé systems with various affine Weyl group symmetries. In this paper, we present a 4 -parameter family of coupled Painlevé III systems with affine Weyl group symmetry of type D (1) 4. Since these universal Bäcklund transformations have Lie theoretic origin, similarity reduction of a Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchy admits such a Bäcklund symmetry. The aim {{of this paper is}} to introduce the system of type D (1) 4. After our discovery of this system, they were studied from the viewpoint of Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchy by K. Fuji independently (cf. [1]), and he succeeded to obtain our system by similarity reduction of the Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchy of type D (1) 4.

40|$|Abstract. The third Painlevé {{equation}} PIII {{is known}} to have symmetry of the affine Weyl group of type C (1) 2 with respect to the Bäcklund transformations. We introduce a new representation of this system. 0. Statement of main results It is well-known by K. Okamoto that the third Painlevé equation has symmetries under the affine Weyl group of type C (1) 2. In this paper, we propose a new representation of the third Painlevé equation. Theorem 0. 1. The third Painlevé equation can be written in the following symmetric form: <b>df</b> 0 <b>dt</b> = − 2 f 0 f 1 f 2 + (α 0 + 2 α 1) f 0 − α 0 f 2, <b>df</b> 1 <b>dt</b> = (f 0 + f 2) f 2 1 − 2 α 1 f 1 + η, <b>df</b> 2 <b>dt</b> = − 2 f 0 f 1 f 2 (1) + (2 α 1 + α 2) f 2 − α 2 f 0. Here, f 0, f 1 and f 2 denote unknown complex variables and α 0, α 1 and α 2 are constant parameters with α 0 + 2 α 1 + α 2 = 1 and η is a nonzero parameter which can be fixed arbitrarily. Theorem 0. 2.

40|$|The {{main focus}} of the present work is to study the Feynman’s proof of the Maxwell {{equations}} using the NC geometry framework. To accomplish this task, we consider two kinds of noncommutativity formulations going {{along the same lines}} as Feynman’s approach. This allows us to go beyond the standard case and discover non-trivial results. In fact, while the first formulation gives rise to the static Maxwell equations, the second formulation is based on the following assumption m[xj, xk] ˙ = i¯hδjk + imθjkf. The results extracted from the second formulation are more significant since they are associated to a non trivial θ-extension of the Bianchi-set of Maxwell equations. We find divθB = ηθ and ∂Bs ∂Ej ∂t + ǫkjs ∂xk = A 1 d 2 f dt 2 + A 2 <b>df</b> <b>dt</b> + A 3, where ηθ, A 1, A 2 and A 3 are local functions depending on the NC θ-parameter. The novelty of this proof in the NC space is revealed notably {{at the level of the}} corrections brought to the previous Maxwell equations. These corrections correspond essentially to the possibility of existence of magnetic charges sources that we can associate to the magnetic monopole since divθB = ηθ is not vanishing in general...|$|E
40|$|Classical {{particle}} mechanics on curved spaces {{is related}} to the flow of ideal fluids, by a dual interpretation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. As in second quantization, the procedure relates the description of a system with a finite number of degrees of freedom to one with infinitely many degrees of freedom. In some two-dimensional fluid mechanics models a duality transformation between the velocity potential and the stream function can be performed relating sources and sinks in one model to vortices in the other. The particle mechanics counterpart of the dual theory is reconstructed. In the quantum theory the strength of sources and sinks, as well as vorticity are quantized; for the duality between theories to be preserved these quantization conditions must be related. 1 Particles The free motion of a classical particle with unit mass, moving in a smooth space with metric gij(x) is described by the Lagrangean L = 1 2 gij(x) ˙x i ˙x j, (1) where as usual the overdot represents a time-derivative. The Euler-Lagrange equations imply that the particle moves on a geodesic: D 2 x i Dt 2 = ¨xi + Γ i jk ˙xj ˙x k = 0. (2) The canonical formulation of this theory is constructed in terms of the momenta pi = ∂L ∂ ˙x i = gij ˙x j, (3) and the hamiltonian H = 1 2 gijpipj.

40|$|Although the {{electrophysiologic}} derangement {{responsible for}} atrial fibrillation (AF) has been elucidated, how AF remodels the ventricular chamber and affects diastolic function (DF) {{has not been}} fully characterized. The previously validated Parametrized Diastolic Filling (PDF) formalism models suction-initiated filling kinematically and generates error-minimized fits to E-wave contours using unique load (xo), relaxation (c), and stiffness (k) parameters. It predicts that E-wave deceleration time (DT) {{is a function of}} both stiffness and relaxation. Ascribing DTs to stiffness and DTr to relaxation such that DT=DTs+DTr is legitimate because of causality and their predicted and observed high correlation (r= 0. 82 and r= 0. 94) with simultaneous (diastatic) chamber stiffness (dP/dV) and isovolumic relaxation (tau), respectively. We analyzed simultaneous echocardiography-cardiac catheterization data and compared 16 age matched, chronic AF subjects to 16, normal sinus rhythm (NSR) subjects (650 beats). All subjects had diastatic intervals. Conventional <b>DF</b> parameters (<b>DT,</b> AT, Epeak, Edur, E-VTI, E/E’) and E-wave derived PDF parameters (c, k, DTs, DTr) were compared. Total DT and DTs, DTr in AF were shorter than in NSR (p< 0. 005), chamber stiffness, (k) in AF was higher than in NSR (p< 0. 001). For NSR, 75 % of DT was due to stiffness and 25 % was due to relaxation whereas for AF 81 % of DT was due to stiffness and 19 % was due to relaxation (p< 0. 005). We conclude that compared to NSR, increased chamber stiffness is one measurable consequence of chamber remodeling in chronic, rate controlled AF. A larger fraction of E-wave DT in AF is due to stiffness compared to NSR. By trending individual subjects, this method can elucidate and characterize the beneficial or adverse long-term effects on chamber remodeling due to alternative therapies in terms of chamber stiffness and relaxation...|$|R
