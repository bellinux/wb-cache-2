40|$|OBJECTIVE: This article {{describes}} the methods occupational therapists use to teach bathing and <b>dressing</b> <b>device</b> use to older patients in rehabilitation programs. The relationship of three patient characteristics to five aspects of assistive device instruction was examined. METHOD: The study sample included 86 patients and 19 occupational therapists who provided the assistive device training. Patients were 55 {{years of age or}} older and in rehabilitation for an orthopedic deficit, cerebrovascular accident, or lower limb amputation. Therapists recorded information on teaching methods, perceptions of patient knowledge, and expectations for future device use after each treatment session. RESULTS: Patients received an average of three dressing and two bathing devices for home use. Therapists devoted an average of two and a half sessions (10 min average duration) to teach <b>dressing</b> <b>device</b> use and an average of one session (9 min average duration) to teach bathing device use. Teaching occurred mostly in the clinic setting through oral instruction and demonstration. At discharge, patients who evaluated devices positively and were evaluated as having a positive affect were perceived by the therapists as 2 ̆ 2 having greater knowledge of device use. 2 ̆ 2 More time was spent teaching those patients with lower Functional Independence Measure scores, less positive evaluations of devices, and lower affect scores. Family caregivers were involved in one or more dressing sessions for 26...|$|E

40|$|Grinding {{is often}} the final step in the process/manufacturing chain, meaning that no {{subsequent}} post-grinding correction of the surface and geometry is performed. This imposes strong requirements on grinding-machine technology and on the understanding of this finalising process. While grinding has unique capabilities it is nevertheless in competition with other machining processes. The evolution of grinding machines is driven by process requirements like accuracy, MRR, and subsurface integrity. The regeneration of the tool on the machine with <b>dressing</b> <b>devices</b> is {{to be regarded as}} unique for grinding machines, hence a grinding machine always runs two separate processes. The high accuracy of grinding has, in fact, been an obstacle to simply adopting developments from other machining processes. Also, a lack of experienced machinists and a general trend towards individualized products and one-piece flow has required a transition from an experience-based approach to a science-based approach. Development is further driven by market demands, such as cost-reduction in terms of CAPEX, footprint, TCO versus quality, and throughput, which affect business models and the machine's design and construction. Moreover, the current mega-trends – such as resource efficiency, individualization, ergonomics and Industry 4. 0 – are changing the appearance of grinding machines, which is also affected by the availability of new technologies, especially sensors, actuators and the control or machine intelligence. This paper reviews the most-relevant technologies, assesses their impact and the readiness of industry to adopt them, identifies the still-open issues, and concludes with future research requirements...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A new <b>dressing</b> <b>device</b> for dense type diamond {{grinding}} wheel, whose elliptic vibration {{was prompted}} by single longitudinal vibration, was designed using a local resonance method. It was employed to dress the metallic bond super-abrasive grinding wheel and the dressing force characteristics were analyzed. The {{results indicate that the}} thrust force decreased to 1 / 7 - 1 / 10 of that of conventional method, and the main cutting force decreased by 70 %. Compared to other dressing parameters, the dressing force in elliptic ultrasonic vibration was more sensitive to grinding speed. Thrust force and main cutting force increased rapidly when rotation speed beyond 72 rpm. But when the ultrasonic power was higher than 50 W, dressing force decreased very slowly. It was observed that the new dressing method is contribute to better surface finish such as more even surface, less crush abrasives, more uniform abrasive abscission and so on than the conventional method...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review recent {{evidence}} supporting {{the guidelines for}} preventing catheter-related and catheter-associated infections. RECENT FINDINGS: A series of studies has confirmed, {{over the past few}} years, that education-based preventive programmes can reduce these infections by one half to two thirds. The {{evidence supporting}} some specific measures has increased for the optimal timing for set replacement, for catheter-site <b>dressing</b> with chlorhexidine-impregnated <b>devices,</b> and for the use of some coated or impregnated intravascular devices. SUMMARY: Catheter-related and associated infections are largely preventable and should not be viewed as an unaffordable tribute to technical medicine. Improvements in existing techniques and new technologies should all be integrated into a structured process of continuous improvement in the quality of care...|$|R
30|$|Limb {{injuries}} creating exposed bone or tendon {{continue to}} be challenging problems for plastic surgeons. There is now {{a better understanding of}} vascular anatomy of the lower leg and better use of improved wound care technology which has led to judicial use of flaps and delayed closures. Severe limb trauma has significant socio-economic effects; there is considerable expenditure in terms of direct costs (orthopedic implants and <b>devices,</b> <b>dressing</b> materials, antibiotics) and indirect costs (lost working days, family involvement, transportation, etc.). For all these reasons, we have decided to evaluate treatment of traumatic lesions of the limbs with an advanced wound care dressing which proposes to promote and sustain effective coverage of bony and tendon structures and, simultaneously, to accelerate the healing process through an induction of the dermal component.|$|R
30|$|Each society, {{there is}} in essence an {{ideology}} and a social value system about women which through the generations have been reproduced, even though this process in which each individual woman speaks, conducts, wears and dresses up has been both self-regulating and subject at the same time.

In other words, the <b>dress</b> is a <b>device</b> that clarifies {{the relationship between the}} body and the living environment as a space outside the body, while the way of dressing the body is an active process and a skill that one physically forms and with which one expresses oneself (Mauss 1973 & Bourdieu 1986 as cited in Craik 2001).|$|R

40|$|Tissue {{viability}} is a speciality {{that truly}} encompasses the holistic needs {{of individuals with}} a wound. As practitioners involved in tissue viability {{it is not just}} the wound that requires assessment, treatment and prevention strategies, but also the assessment of nutrition, pain, stress, mobility, altered body image and any underlying disease process prior to choosing the most appropriate <b>dressing</b> and pressure-redistributing <b>devices.</b> Additionally, tissue viability practitioners are expected to develop business cases to support the speciality, and to liaise with members of the multidisciplinary team who are involved in the care of the patient. Although tissue viability tends to be nurse-led, there are numerous professional groups that will also be involved in this care, including healthcare assistants, podiatrists, physiotherapists, medical staff, occupational therapists and dieticians. It is therefore important that all those involved in tissue viability understand the importance of the quality agenda that will affect their day to day delivery of care...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{compare the}} {{available}} <b>dressing</b> and securement <b>devices</b> for central venous access devices (CVADs). Design: Systematic review of randomised controlled trials. Data sources: Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews and of Effects, NHS Economic Evaluation Database, Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, clinical trial registries and reference lists of identified trials. Review methods: Studies evaluated {{the effects of}} <b>dressing</b> and securement <b>devices</b> for CVADs. All types of CVADs were included. Outcome measures were CVAD-related bloodstream infection, CVAD tip colonisation, entry and exit site infection, skin colonisation, skin irritation, failed CVAD securement, dressing condition and mortality. We used standard methodological approaches as expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Results: We included 22 studies involving 7436 participants comparing nine different types of securement <b>device</b> or <b>dressing.</b> All included studies were at unclear or high risk of performance bias due to the different appearances of the dressings and securement devices. It is unclear {{whether there is a}} difference in the rate of CVAD-related bloodstream infection between securement with gauze and tape and standard polyurethane (RR 0. 64, 95 % CI 0. 26 to 1. 63, low quality evidence), or between chlorhexidine gluconate-impregnated dressings and standard polyurethane (RR 0. 65, 95 % CI 0. 40 to 1. 05, moderate quality evidence). There is high quality evidence that medication-impregnated dressings reduce the incidence of CVAD-related bloodstream infection relative to all other dressing types (RR 0. 60, 95 % CI 0. 39 to 0. 93). There is moderate quality evidence that chlorhexidine gluconate-impregnated dressings reduce the frequency of CVAD-related bloodstream infection per 1000 patient days compared with standard polyurethane dressings (RR 0. 51, 95 % CI 0. 33 to 0. 78). There is moderate quality evidence that catheter tip colonisation is reduced with chlorhexidine gluconate-impregnated dressings compared with standard polyurethane dressings (RR 0. 58, 95 % CI 0. 47 to 0. 73), but the relative effects of gauze and tape and standard polyurethane are unclear (RR 0. 95, 95 % CI 0. 51 to 1. 77, very low quality evidence). Conclusions: Medication-impregnated dressing products reduce the incidence of CVAD-related bloodstream infection relative to all other dressing types. There is some evidence that chlorhexidine gluconate-impregnated dressings, relative to standard polyurethane dressings, reduce CVAD-related bloodstream infection for the outcomes of frequency of infection per 1000 patient days, risk of catheter tip colonisation and possibly risk of CVAD-related bloodstream infection. Most studies were conducted in intensive care unit settings. More, high quality research is needed regarding the relative effects of dressing and securement products for CVADs...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: to {{evaluate}} the use of peripheral venous catheters based on microbiological analysis of <b>devices</b> (<b>dressing</b> and three-way stopcocks) and thus contribute to the prevention and infection control. Methods: this was a prospective study of microbiological analysis of 30 three-way stopcocks (external surfaces and lumens) and 30 dressing used in maintaining the peripheral venous catheters of hospitalized adult patients. Results: all external surfaces, 40 % of lumens, and 86. 7 % of dressing presented bacterial growth. The main species isolated in the lumen were 50 % coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, 14. 3 % Staphylococcus aureus, and 14. 3 % Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Fifty nine percent of multidrug-resistant bacteria were isolated of the three-way stopcocks, 42 % of the lumens, and 44 % of the dressing with a predominance of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus resistant to methicillin. Besides, 18 % gram-negative bacteria with resistance to carbapenems were identified from multidrug-resistant bacteria on the external surfaces of the three-way stopcocks. Conclusion: it is important to emphasize the isolation of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and gram-negative bacteria resistant to methicillin and carbapenems in samples of devices, respectively, which reinforces the importance of nursing care in the maintenance of the biologically safe environment as well as prevention and infection control practices...|$|R
40|$|In this article, we use {{clothes as}} a tool for {{exploring}} the life stories and narratives of people with dementia, eliciting memories through the sensory and material dimensions of dress. The article draws on an Economic and Social Research Councilfunded study, ‘Dementia and Dress’, which explored everyday experiences of clothing for carers, care workers and people with dementia, using qualitative and ethnographic methods including: ‘wardrobe interviews’, observations, and visual and sensory approaches. In our analysis, we use three dimensions of <b>dress</b> as a <b>device</b> for exploring the experiences of people with dementia: kept clothes, as a way of retaining connections to memories and identity; discarded clothes, and their implications for understanding change and loss in relation to the ‘dementia journey’; and absent clothes, invoked through the sensory imagination, recalling images of former selves, and carrying identity forward into the context of care. The article contributes to understandings of narrative, identity and dementia, drawing attention to the potential ofmaterial objects for evoking narratives, and maintaining biographical continuity for both men and women. The paper has larger implications for understandings of ageing and care practice; as well as contributing to the wider Material Turn in gerontology, showing how cultural analyses can be applied even to frail older groups who are often excluded from such approaches...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Effective postinsertion {{management}} of central venous access devices (CVADs) {{is important to}} prevent CVAD-associated complications, including catheter-associated bloodstream infections. Although there is a wealth of evidence-based guidelines available to guide the care of CVADs, applying their recommendations to the clinical setting across variable patient groups, CVAD types and international healthcare settings is challenging. This may result in patients receiving suboptimal care. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study using an online survey was performed with an aim to determine current CVAD site care practices internationally. The CVAD site care domains included skin antisepsis, dressing selection, frequency of <b>dressing</b> change and <b>device</b> securement practices across impaired and unimpaired CVAD sites. Results: Clinicians (n = 1044) residing in 34 countries reported diversity in their practice, {{with the majority of}} respondents practicing as nurses (89 %) from North America (81 %) as vascular access specialists (52 %). The respondents’ reported practice was variant, with differing inconsistency to guidelines throughout each of the domains. There was wide variance in the {{management of}} CVAD sites with impaired skin integrity, such as rash, skin stripping/adhesive-related injuries and drainage. Vascular access clinicians reported high levels of confidence in managing CVAD sites, including those with impaired skin. Conclusions: These inconsistencies are reflective of the complex and heterogeneous populations requiring CVADs, the evidence available to support practice in this area, the skills and knowledge of the clinicians caring for them and the resources of the healthcare setting. Further research and education is necessary to ensure that CVAD site care is undertaken effectively to minimise preventable complications. Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Over 70 % of all {{hospital}} admissions have {{a peripheral}} intravenous device (PIV) inserted; however, the failure rate of PIVs is unacceptably high, {{with up to}} 69 % of these devices failing before treatment is complete. Failure can be due to dislodgement, phlebitis, occlusion/infiltration and/or infection. This results in interrupted medical therapy; painful phlebitis and reinsertions; increased hospital length of stay, morbidity and mortality from infections; and wasted medical/nursing time. Appropriate PIV dressing and securement may prevent many cases of PIV failure, but little comparative data exist regarding the efficacy of various PIV dressing and securement methods. This trial will investigate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of 4 methods of PIV dressing and securement in preventing PIV failure. Methods and analysis A multicentre, parallel group, superiority randomised controlled trial with 4 arms, 3 experimental groups (tissue adhesive, bordered polyurethane <b>dressing,</b> sutureless securement <b>device)</b> and 1 control (standard polyurethane dressing) is planned. There will be a 3 -year recruitment of 1708 adult patients, with allocation concealment until randomisation by a centralised web-based service. The primary outcome is PIV failure which includes any of: dislodgement, occlusion/infiltration, phlebitis and infection. Secondary outcomes include: types of PIV failure, PIV dwell time, costs, device colonisation, skin colonisation, patient and staff satisfaction. Relative incidence rates of device failure per 100 devices and per 1000 device days with 95 % CIs will summarise the impact of each dressing, and test differences between groups. Kaplan-Meier survival curves (with log-rank Mantel-Cox test) will compare device failure over time. p Values of < 0. 05 will be considered significant. Secondary end points will be compared between groups using parametric or non-parametric techniques appropriate to level of measurement...|$|R
40|$|Background: Peripheral {{arterial}} catheters {{are widely}} used {{in the care of}} intensive care patients for continuous blood pressure monitoring and blood sampling, yet failure – from dislodgement, accidental removal, and complications of phlebitis, pain, occlusion and infection – is common. While appropriate methods of dressing and securement are required to reduce these complications that cause failure, few studies have been conducted in this area. Objectives: To determine initial effectiveness of one dressing and two securement methods versus usual care, in minimising failure in peripheral arterial catheters. Feasibility objectives were considered successful if 90 / 120 patients (75 %) received the study intervention and protocol correctly, and had ease and satisfaction scores for the study <b>dressing</b> and securement <b>devices</b> of ≥ 7 on Numerical Rating Scale scores 1 – 10. Methods: In this single-site, four-arm, parallel, pilot randomised controlled trial, patients with arterial catheters, inserted in the operating theatre and admitted to the intensive care unit postoperatively, were randomly assigned to either one of the three treatment groups (bordered polyurethane dressing (n = 30); a sutureless securement device (n = 31); tissue adhesive (n = 32)), or a control group (usual practice polyurethane dressing (not bordered) (n = 30)). Results: One hundred and twenty-three patients completed the trial. The primary outcome of catheter failure was 2 / 32 (6. 3 %) for tissue adhesive, 4 / 30 (13. 3 %) for bordered polyurethane, 5 / 31 (16. 1 %) for the sutureless securement device, and 6 / 30 (20 %) for the control usual care polyurethane. Feasibility criteria were fulfilled. Cost analysis suggested that tissue adhesive was the most cost effective. Conclusions: The pilot trial showed that the novel technologies were at least as effective as the present method of a polyurethane dressing for dressing and securement of arterial catheters, and may be cost effective. The trial also provided evidence that a larger, multicentre trial would be feasible. Griffith Health, School of Nursing and MidwiferyFull Tex...|$|R
