To build these models, knowledge might have to be collected from domain experts who are rarely modelling experts and don’t usually have the time or desire to learn a modelling language. We investigate an app- roach to overcome this challenge by using physical tokens to represent the conceptual model. We call the resulting models tangible models. We illustrate this idea by creating a tangible representation of a socio- technical modelling language and provide initial evidence of the relative usability and utility of tangible versus abstract modelling.

More precisely, we argue that iterative learning {{can be used for}} generalizing idiographic-qualitative research findings that were derived from investigating the ‘extraordinary’ instances of the population. We first outline the notions of iterative learning, idiographic research, and the extraordinary. Then, we continue to <b>discuss</b> <b>generalizability</b> in idiographic research. Finally, we make a link to Polanyi’s principle of mutual control and argue that, when linked with iterative learning, idiographic research results can be accepted and become valuable intellectual commodities of the research community. The principle of mutual control is our starting point for further re-search and we welcome any suggestions, comments, and experiences on the effects of mutual control on the iterative learning process...|$|E

Furthermore, the civilian experiments reveal that two measures of cognitive ability predict honesty, whereas general self-report honesty questions and a consistency check among them are of no value.

We empirically study whether users are successfully securing their client computers when using wireless networks. Automated techniques are used that scan users’ machines after they associate with a university wireless network. This determines whether a firewall is being used and what TCP ports are open. Results show that over 9 % of 3, 331 unique computers scanned were not using a properly configured firewall. In addition, almost 9 % had at least one TCP port open, with almost 6 % having open ports with significant security implications. We also found and discuss cases where connected computers were compromised by Trojan programs such as SubSeven and NetBus.

To this end, we tested the hypotheses that the activity of users on scholarly social networks is associated with academic output, and that the intra-or interdisciplinary background of scholars affects academic output and online activity. The quantitative data {{used for this study}} was collected from the publicly-accessible scholarly social network HASTAC and complemented with a qualitative survey collected from 123 students and recent alumni of the HASTAC Scholars Program. After processing the different sources of data, we rejected the hypotheses that academic output and activity on scholarly social networks are affected by scholar's intra-or interdisciplinary backgrounds, but our results partially support the hypothesis that activity in scholarly networks is associated with academic output.

30|$|Despite the {{extraordinarily}} high {{ownership concentration}} widely observed in emerging market firms {{as a result}} of institutional voids, there is little research on how this high ownership concentration affects the exporting behavior of emerging market firms. From principal–agent and institutional perspectives, we hypothesize that high ownership concentration has a negative relationship with export intensity, because, in emerging markets, highly concentrated ownership bridges the interests of owners (principals) and managers (agents) so that principals must be prudent in exploring risky international markets. Moreover, we hypothesize that export country diversification strengthens the relationship between ownership concentration and export intensity, because broad geographic dispersion increases risk exposure and principal-agent problems. Empirical analysis based on a panel dataset for publicly listed firms in Peru from 2005 to 2014 supports the hypotheses. The study highlights the risk aversion attitude activated by ownership concentration, an attitude that protects emerging market firms from overconfidently exploring international business opportunities. The study extends the conventional literature on the interface between ownership concentration and international business in an emerging market context. We also <b>discuss</b> the <b>generalizability</b> of the findings to other emerging markets, e.g. China.|$|R
40|$|We welcome David Levi-Faur s {{critique}} of our article, both because it serves to stimulate debate on this important topic {{and because it}} provides us {{with the opportunity to}} elaborate on our arguments and touch on their wider potential applicability. Levi-Faur does not take issue with our central empirical finding that American legal style is spreading to other jurisdictions nor with our normative assessment of the mixed blessings of this trend. We agree with Levi-Faur that many questions concerning legal change have been largely overlooked by political scientists, and we agree that he raises a number of points that highlight the need for refinements of our argument. Yet, for all that we agree on, we disagree strongly with Levi-Faur s analysis and his main lines of criticism. His core criticisms concern our conceptualization of the dependent variable in our study, our purported disregard of alternative explanations, and our inadequate attention to the importers of American law and processes of localization. In this article, we respond to each of these criticisms in turn. We then <b>discuss</b> the <b>generalizability</b> of our argument beyond Europe and Japan.

40|$|Socio-technical {{models are}} models that {{represent}} social {{as well as}} technical elements of the modeling subject, where the technical part consists of both physical and digital elements. Examples are enterprise models and models of the target of assessment used in risk assessment. Constructing and validating these models often implies a challenging task of extracting and integrating information from a multitude of stakeholders which are rarely modelling experts and don’t usually {{have the time or}} desire to engage in modelling activities. We investigate a promising approach to overcome this challenge by using physical tokens to represent the model. We call the resulting models tangible models. In this paper we illustrate this idea by creating a tangible representations of a socio-technical modelling language used in Risk Assessment and provide an initial validation of the relative usability and utility of tangible versus abstract modelling by an experiment and a focus group, respectively. We discuss possible psychological and social mechanisms that could explain the enhanced usability and utility of tangible modelling approaches for domain experts.

40|$|AOSD aims at {{improving}} key software engineering properties (such as traceability, comprehensibility, and evolvability) through the separation and modularization of crosscutting concerns. The majority of AOSD {{research focuses on}} individual software engineering activities (such as implementation or requirements) in isolation.

40|$|As machine {{learning}} (ML) systems emerge in end-user applications, learning algorithms and classifiers {{will need to}} be robust to an increasingly unpredictable operating environment. In many cases, the parameters governing a learning system cannot be optimized for every user scenario, nor can users typically manipulate parameters defined in the space and terminology of ML. Conventional approaches to user-oriented ML systems have typically hidden this complexity from users by automating parameter adjustment. We propose a new paradigm, in which model and algorithm parameters are exposed directly to end-users with intuitive labels, suitable for applications where parameters cannot be automatically optimized or where there is additional motivation – such as creative flexibility – to expose, rather than fix or automatically adapt, learning parameters. In our CHI 2008 paper, we introduced and evaluated MySong, a system that uses a Hidden Markov Model to generate chords to accompany a vocal melody. The present paper formally describes the learning underlying MySong and discusses the mechanisms by which MySong‟s learning parameters are exposed to users, as a case study in making ML systems user-configurable. We <b>discuss</b> the <b>generalizability</b> of this approach, and propose that intuitively exposing ML parameters is a key challenge for the ML and human-computer-interaction communities. 1.

Research into IT architecture either is of a strategic nature, yielding no operational guidelines for the practicing IT-architect, or {{it is part of}} software engineering, yielding no guidelines that related software architecture to the business environment. In this paper we report on a detailed case study of an operational IT architecture process, in which we investigated the relationship between IT architecture and business context. We analyze this process in terms of a conceptual framework for IT architecture presented earlier. The major findings are that in this case study there is a close relationship between IT architecture and the structure of the IT department, which makes IT architecture design also a problem of organizational design; that application architecture is designed by aligning applications to the business process structure; and that IT infrastructure architecture is designed by aligning it to technological trends rather than to business goals and problems.

40|$|In {{addition}} to the wireless telephony boom, a similar exponentially increasing trend in wireless data service [...] for example, short message service (SMS) [...] is visible as technology advances. We develop a structural model to examine user demand for voice service and SMS. Specifically, we measure the own- and cross-price elasticities of these services. The cross-price elasticity is of significant importance because marketing activities are critically influenced by whether the goods are substitutes or complements. The research context poses significant econometric challenges due to three-part tariffs and sequential discrete plan choice and continuous quantity choice decisions. Using detailed individual consumption data of more than 6, 000 customers, we find that SMS and voice service are small substitutes. A 10 % increase {{in the price of}} voice minutes will induce about a 0. 8 % increase in the demand for SMS. The own-price elasticity of voice is also low, to the order of approximately - 0. 1. Younger users' demand is far more inelastic than that of older users. We then conduct counterfactual policy experiments that fully capture the effects of changes in key parameters on the firm's revenues.

40|$|Several {{previous}} {{studies have examined the}} impact of auditor switching on audit fees. The underpinning theory of these studies is that a potential new auditor will cut initial audit fees (low ball) in order to secure an audit, and the ensuing stream of audit fees including a quasi-rent component payable to any incumbent auditor. Empirical evidence of the presence of audit fee cutting subsequent to an auditor switch is mixed. The present study proposes an alternative theory which argues that a potential new auditor will low ball in order to secure an audit but that such fee cutting is conditional on non-audit services (NAS) growth between the year prior to the auditor change and {{the first year of the}} new audit engagement. That is, the audit fee cut will be recouped by revenue generated from the provision of auditor supplied non-audit services. The study is based on data from 270 publicly listed Australian companies taken at a time when NAS fees provided by incumbent auditors were rising. The empirical evidence shows that auditees who report an auditor change together with real growth in the fees for auditor supplied non-audit services, show a significantly lower audit fee than situations in which these two conditions do not exist together.

40|$|Unlike the {{conventional}} first-order network (FoN), the higher-order network (HoN) {{provides a more}} accurate description of transitions by creating additional nodes to encode higher-order dependencies. However, there exists no visualization and exploration tool for the HoN. For applications such as the development of strategies to control species invasion through global shipping which is known to exhibit higher-order dependencies, the existing FoN visualization tools are limited. In this paper, we present HoNVis, a novel visual analytics framework for exploring higher-order dependencies of the global ocean shipping network. Our framework leverages coordinated multiple views to reveal the network structure at three levels of detail (i. e., the global, local, and individual port levels). Users can quickly identify ports of interest {{at the global level}} and specify a port to investigate its higher-order nodes at the individual port level. Investigating a larger-scale impact is enabled through the exploration of HoN at the local level. Using the global ocean shipping network data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a real-world use case conducted by domain experts specializing in species invasion.

Our methodology defines the decisions that must be made, identifies relevant historical, initial, and trending data sources, and develops numerical thresholds, quantitative relationships, and optimization models to support decision making. The general process also offers flexibility to consider non-quantitative factors and spans multiple review periods. We apply this methodology to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) program for establishing and managing Disaster Recovery Centers (DRCs) after a disaster. A detailed case study of one disaster response and relevant historical data {{provide the basis for}} DRC decision making thresholds, relationships, and optimization models.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of asthma, and the morbidity, adverse events, mortality and healthcare utilisation of asthmatic patients vary widely among racial/ethnic and other socio-demographic groups. Debates over {{the meanings of}} race and ethnicity and the strategic need to resolve health inequalities have prompted extensive recommendations for reporting and analyzing racial/ethnic and demographic information in clinical trials. We conducted a systematic review {{to determine the extent to}} which race/ethnicity, socio-economic status and other demographic variables are analyzed and reported in publications from randomized controlled trials of asthma interventions. Randomized controlled trials of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting ?-agonists in asthmatic patients were identified by systematically searching 12 electronic bibliographic databases. We identified peer-reviewed papers reporting 87 relevant trials published during 1985 – 2006, from which we extracted data on patients' race/ethnicity, ancestry, gender, socio-economic variables and geographical attributes. The proportion of the papers reporting the race/ethnicity of their participants was lower than would be expected by chance and has recently declined. None of the papers included race/ethnicity or gender in statistical analyses or reported socio-economic variables, ancestry, or genetic data for their participants, and few <b>discussed</b> the <b>generalizability</b> of their findings. The frequency of reporting race/ethnicity was statistically significantly lower in trials conducted in the UK than in the US, but 23 of the 87 papers did not identify countries. Despite extensive recommendations in the literature, guidance from health agencies on analyzing and reporting demographic data in clinical trials still appears inconsistent and vague. There remains a need to improve guidance on the representation and analysis of minority populations in asthma clinical trials, in order to encourage transparent reporting of population selection, analysis approaches, and trial generalizability. To assist this process, asthma clinical trials should be based on clear hypotheses that link both to existing demographic evidence and to demographic healthcare goals. <br/...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{analysis}} {{is a critical}} assessment of current hormesis literature. I <b>discuss</b> definitions, characterization, <b>generalizability,</b> mechanisms, absence of empirical data specific for hormesis hypothesis testing, and arguments that hormesis be the “default assumption ” in risk assessment. DATA SOURCES: Hormesis, a biological phenomenon typically described as low-dose stimulation from substances producing higher-dose inhibition, has recently garnered interest in several quarters. The principal sources of published materials for this analysis are the writings of certain proponents of hormesis. Surprisingly few systematic critiques of current hormesis literature exist. Limits to the phenomenon’s appropriate role in risk assessment and health policy have been published. DATA SYNTHESIS: Serious gaps in scientific understanding remain: a stable definition; generalizability, especially for humans; a clear mechanistic basis; limitations {{in the presence of}} multiple toxic end points, target organs, and mechanisms. Absence of both arms-length, consensus-driven, scientific evaluations and empirical data from studies specifically designed for hormesis testing have limited its acceptance. CONCLUSIONS: Definition, characterization, occurrence, and mechanistic rationale for hormesis will remain speculative, absent rigorous studies done specifically for hormesis testing. Any role for hormesis in current risk assessment and regulatory policies for toxics remains to be determined.

40|$|The {{development}} of culturally and linguistically appropriate measurement {{is necessary to}} enable accurate assessment of preschool children’s interpersonal competence and behavioral difficulties. This need is most pressing for children from Hispanic backgrounds, who currently represent the fastest growing population of U. S. children. The present study investigated {{the psychometric properties of}} a Spanish and English version of the Penn Interactive Peer Play Scale (PIPPS; Fantuzzo et al., 1995) when employed with Spanish- and English-speaking teachers and students in an urban, Southeastern community. Psychometrically sound structures were obtained with the Spanish translation of the PIPPS in support of the three original dimensions named Play Interaction, Play Disruption, and Play Disconnection, which were derived from studies of African American preschool children in lower income, Northeastern communities. Concurrent validity was supported by significant correlationsbetween the three Spanish PIPPS constructs and teacher ratings of externalizing and internalizing behavior problems. Significant group differences in class-room peer play interactions were also detected for children’s gender and ethnicity. The independent emergence of comparable Spanish and English PIPPS factor structures across two distinct regional samples provides initial support for use of this measure in research with Hispanic preschool children from low-income backgrounds. Implications for school psychologists engaging in outreach to preschool programs servicing diverse groups of children are <b>discussed,</b> including the <b>generalizability</b> of interactive peer play constructs for preschool children across racial, ethnic, linguistic, and geographic back-grounds...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the communicative use of family homes within the daily life of a rural community. As an ethnography of communicative behavior, the nature and functions of the home as a medium of communication are explored within a specified social context so that the social and cultural influences which shape its use and interpretation may be examined. The study explores the structure of rules, roles, values, customs and beliefs which organize how homes are used, how they are evaluated, and how they come to assume meaning within this frame of reference. It was hypothesized that family homes, as media of social communication, function as artifacts of and instruments for the structure of social relations that prevail within the community that employs them. Research was directed, therefore, to examining the role of family homes in the expression of patterns of association and differentiation through which social identity and the community 2 ̆ 7 s system of social status are negotiated, marked and maintained. ^ The study draws on fourteen months of fieldwork, during which family homes were investigated as complex, multi-modal systems of communicative activity. Patterns of household maintenance, rules and customs in the use of household and community space, comparisons of house size and layout, traditions in the acquisition and use of furnishings, and patterns in taste preferences are each examined as integrated aspects of this system of communication. ^ In this way a structure of shared values, standards and traditions is described which is shown to regulate the conduct and interpretation of activity in this sphere at a variety of levels. While previous research has emphasized the home 2 ̆ 7 s value as an index of social class, this study finds that households are, in this insular community, devoted centrally to the expression of a family 2 ̆ 7 s social orientation and moral repute. Processes of status comparison are muted, while homes serve to mark and maintain interdependent networks of kinship and affiliation through which social life is ordered and personal identity is defined.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the {{feasibility}} of choiceless control in determining perceptions of control, influence, responsibility, and helplessness over outcomes. After reviewing and critiquing some traditional theories and research that exist in the control literature, a new conceptualization of control is presented. Based on research by Nickels et al. (2005), an extended research design was proposed and tested, which examined the separate effects of actual control, choice, and predictability. The present findings show significantly higher ratings of perceived influence under conditions in which individuals made their own choice (whether voluntary or involuntary) between options that made a difference (actual control) in a failed outcome that was predicted. Whereas perceived control ratings were significantly higher with actual control, feelings of responsibility over the outcome were significantly higher when actual control was combined with a voluntary choice. Although feelings of helplessness were not significantly affected, ratings of frustration over the outcome were significantly higher when actual control was combined with the prediction that a failed outcome would occur. The theoretical relevance of these findings is <b>discussed,</b> and the <b>generalizability</b> of the new conceptualization of control is explored in terms of its relation to positive psychology (e. g., humour) and cross-cultural research frameworks.
