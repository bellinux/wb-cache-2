2500|$|Ocelot {{has been}} {{frequently}} {{featured in the}} lists of best Metal Gear villains. In 2008, he placed seventh in IGN's top list of Metal Gear Solid boss battles, and second on the top list of Metal Gear villains. Including him on their 2007 list of the best Metal Gear bosses, GameSpot called {{him one of the}} most important characters from the story alongside Solid Snake and Big Boss. In 2008, the torture he makes in Metal Gear Solid was listed by GameSpy as one of the best moments from the game due to how Ocelot toys with Snake and <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>is</b> to pass it besides how significant is the outcome for the rest of the game. In response to his role in Metal Gear Solid 3, GameSpy called Ocelot one of the [...] "series mainstay", hoping he would become an entertaining opponent.|$|E

For at least four years, an Act of Parliament had prohibited these Sunday sports. Still the supinelness of the justices, and the connivance of the clergy, allowed the rabble youth to congregate on the Green at Elstow, summoned by the church bells to celebrate their sports and pastimes, {{as they had been}} in the habit of doing on the Lord's day.[57] ...|$|E

It was right and generous to abstain from sweets with this end in view; but it was wrong to be rude and unthankful to the sister who meant all so kindly, and was the most unselfish of all. She turned round to Elizabeth with the kind offer of the dainty she had not even tasted herself, but was not more graciously treated.|$|E

And then at last the supreme moment of my triumph arrived. In {{the very act of}} turning I caught him fair with such another back-handed cut as that with which I killed the aide-de-camp of the Emperor of Russia. He flew into two pieces, his head one way and his tail another. I looked back and waved the blood-stained sabre in the air. For the moment I was exalted--superb! ...|$|E

6000|$|There seems, {{at first}} view, to {{be a special}} {{difference}} of opinion in respect {{to the nature of}} the process by which these principles come to be implanted or developed in the minds of the young; for all must admit that in early infancy they are not there, or, at least, that they do not appear. No one would expect to find in two infants--twin-brothers, we will suppose--creeping on the floor, with one apple between them, that there could be, at that age, any principles of right or justice, or of brotherly love existing in their hearts that could prevent their both crying and quarrelling for it. [...] "True," [...] says one; [...] "but there are germs of those principles which, in time, will be developed." [...] "No," [...] rejoins another," [...] there are no germs of them, there are only capacities for them, through which, by Divine power, the germs may hereafter be introduced." [...] But when we reflect upon the difficulty of forming any clear and practical idea of the difference between a germ--in a bud upon an apple-tree, for instance--which may ultimately produce fruit, and a capacity for producing it which may subsequently be developed, and still more, <b>how</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>is</b> it to picture to our minds what is represented by these words in the case of a human soul, it would seem as if the apparent difference in people's opinions on such a point must be less a difference in respect to facts than in respect to the phraseology by which the facts should be represented.|$|E
