50|$|By 1979, {{the company}} {{was the result of}} thirty six <b>dairy</b> <b>purchases,</b> nine mergers, and two joint ventures, and those listed {{previously}} are {{only a few of the}} many that occurred. The businesses purchased by the cooperative varied greatly, from distributors to ice cream producers. Prairie Farms acquired dairies with sales ranging from $250,000 a year to $7,000,000 a year, and the reason for the purchase ranged from the acquisition of a competitor’s customer base to gaining new facilities with modern technology. The total amount paid for the mergers and acquisitions up until 1982 was more than ten million dollars.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was development of a method of estimating nutrient availability in populations as approximated by supermarket purchase records. Demographic information describing 12, 516 panel households was obtained from a marketing and advertising program operated by H. E. Butt Grocery Company of San Antonio, Texas. A non-probability sample of 2, 161 households meeting expenditure criteria was selected and all purchases of dairy products for this sample of households were organized into a database constructed to facilitate the retrieval, aggregation, and analysis of dairy product purchases and their nutrient contents. Two hypotheses were tested: (1) no difference would be found between Hispanic and non-Hispanic purchases of dairy product categories during the study period and (2) no difference would be found between Hispanic and non-Hispanic purchases of nutrients contained in those dairy products during the thirteen-week study period. ^ Food purchase records were used to estimate nutrient exposure on a weekly, per capita basis for Hispanic and non-Hispanic households by linking some 40, 000 dairy purchase Universal Product code (UPC) numbers with food composition values contained in USDA Handbook 8 - 1. Results of this study suggest Hispanic sample households consistently purchased fewer dairy products than did non-Hispanic sample households and consequently had fewer nutrients available from <b>dairy</b> <b>purchases.</b> While weekly expenditures for dairy products among the sample households remained relatively constant during the study period, shifts in the types of dairy products purchased were observed. The effect of ethnicity on dairy product and nutrient purchases was significant over the thirteen-week period. A database consisting of customer, household, and purchase information can be developed to successfully associate food item UPC numbers with a standard reference of food composition to estimate nutrient availability in a population over extended periods of time. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether the Jersey Breed is economically more feasible than the Holstein Breed on Rancho Teresita Dairy in Tulare. Beginning In March of 2011 the <b>dairy</b> <b>purchased</b> 380 milking Jersey cows. The <b>dairy</b> decided to <b>purchase</b> Jerseys because in 2008 the ethanol mandate started, causing the feed prices to climb. This study evaluated reproduction, calving ease, production, and feed efficiency. Jersey heifers are bred for the first time at 12 months and Holstein cows are bred for the first time at 14 months. The Jersey cows have a higher overall conception rate (CR) of 32 % vs. 29 % CR of a Holstein cow. Because the Jersey breed has an easier time getting pregnant we see that they also have a higher pregnancy rate of 25 % over the Holstein cows at 20 %. Jersey cows are bred back after calving around 66 days and Holstein cows at about 69 days. Production has a direct relationship with reproduction. Holstein cows produce an average of 76. 91 lbs. /day vs. Jerseys with lower number of 59. 27 lbs. /day. The composition of the milk varies between breeds. Holstein milk has 3. 57 % fat, 3. 03 % protein, and 8. 78 % solids-not-fat. Jerseys on the other hand have 4. 98 % fat, 3. 66 % protein, and 9. 42 % solids-not-fat. Although Holstein cows produce a greater volume, Jersey’s have a much better composition. Energy Corrected Milk (ECM) allows for the Jersey milk to be on equal grounds as the Holstein milk. After energy correcting the milk the Holstein herd had an average ECM of 77. 24 lbs. and the Jersey herd had an average ECM of 72. 31 lbs. Lastly the feed efficiency (FE) was calculated, the average FE for Jersey cows is 1. 61 and for Holstein cows is 1. 38. The evaluation was helpful for the dairy by comparing the efficiency of the two breeds...|$|R

40|$|In this article, we {{extend the}} {{literature}} on merger simulation models by incorporating its potential synergy gains into structural econometric analysis. We present a three-step integrated approach. We estimate a structural demand and supply model, as in Bonnet and Dubois (2010).

Then we estimate potential efficiency gains using the Data Envelopment Analysis approach of Bogetoft and Wang (2005), and some assumptions about exogenous cost shifters. In the last step, we simulate the new price equilibrium post merger taking into account synergy gains, and derive price and welfare effects. We use a homescan dataset of <b>dairy</b> dessert <b>purchases</b> in France, and show that {{for two of the}} three mergers considered, synergy gains could offset the upward pressure on prices post.

40|$|Dairy Research, 2006 {{is known}} as Dairy Day, 2006 Efficient {{utilization}} of nutrients is a must on modern dairies. Most of the phosphorus arriving at the dairy will either be found in purchased feedstuffs or commercial fertilizer used to raise grain and forage for the dairy. In general, those <b>dairies</b> that <b>purchase</b> all feeds are more efficient with phosphorus utilization than those that grow forage and grain. This is likely due to increased inefficiencies associ-ated with feeding and crop enterprises. Care-ful evaluation of diets to reduce feeding ex-cess phosphorus can reduce phosphorus excre-tion in the manure {{by as much as}} 50 %. This not only reduces input costs, but also reduces the total cost of land application. The most efficient way to manage dairy farm nutrients is to develop a comprehensive nutrient manage-ment plan that includes both the cropping and animal enterprises.
