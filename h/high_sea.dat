5|$|By the {{afternoon}} of September8, an eye began to develop within a central dense overcast. Later that day, Fred intensified into a Category 1 hurricane with winds estimated at 75mph (120km/h). By the morning of September9, satellite imagery depicted that Fred had undergone rapid intensification and attained Category 2 status. This resulted from {{the formation of a}} 12mi (19km) wide eye due to low wind shear and <b>high</b> <b>sea</b> surface temperatures. This intensification continued for several more hours, ending with Fred attaining satellite-estimated its peak intensity as a solid Category 3 hurricane with winds of 120mph (195km/h) and an estimated barometric pressure of 958mbar (hPa; 28.29inHg), making it the second strongest storm of the season.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} morning hours of August4, the NHC {{upgraded}} Tropical Depression Eight-E to Tropical Storm Felicia, the seventh named storm of the season. Located within an area of low wind shear and <b>high</b> <b>sea</b> surface temperatures, averaging between 28 and 29°C (82 and 84°F), the storm quickly developed, with deep convection persisting around the center of circulation. These conditions were anticipated to persist for at least three days; however, there was an increased amount of uncertainty due to possible interaction with Tropical Storm Enrique. Several hours later, the storm began to undergo rapid intensification, following the formation of an eye. Around 2:00pm PDT (2100UTC), Felicia intensified into a hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Cindy was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to form in the Gulf of Mexico since 1960. The third named storm of the 1963 Atlantic hurricane season, Cindy developed within a trough as a tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico on 16September. The disturbance swiftly intensified to hurricane strength, with a distinct eye becoming visible on satellite imagery as it drifted north-northwestwards toward the Texas coastline. Despite favorable conditions, with <b>high</b> <b>sea</b> surface temperatures, the storm only intensified into a Category1 hurricane. After peaking with 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h), it made landfall at High Island {{on the morning of}} 17September as a slightly weaker system with an atmospheric pressure of 996mbar (hPa; 29.41inHg). Cindy remained nearly stationary for almost a day, dropping copious rainfall over the Texas coastal plain, before finally turning west-southwestward and dissipating west of Corpus Christi on 20September.|$|E

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, there was a decline in the Ribeira shipyard activities, due to the aggradation of the Portuguese coast and the Povoan shipyard started to work in the construction of fishing vessels. There was a significant increase of the fisher community {{in the middle of the}} century, becoming the main activity, and during the reign of Joseph I with the country in the middle of an economic crisis, Póvoa started a rapid development. The Royal Academy of Sciences of Lisbon noticed their overwhelming notoriety in the Minho coast and considered Povoans to be the most expert fishermen from Cape St. Vincent to Caminha, with a sizable number of fishermen, ships and <b>high</b> <b>sea</b> fishing.

5|$|On July4, 2005, the National Hurricane Center {{classified}} {{a tropical}} depression near the Windward Islands. This system moved briskly to the west-northwest, becoming Tropical Storm Dennis the following day. Taking advantage of highly favorable environmental factors, such as low wind shear and <b>high</b> <b>sea</b> surface temperatures, Dennis rapidly intensified. By July6, the system reached hurricane strength {{as it began}} traversing the Jamaica Channel. Around 18:00UTC on July7, the hurricane passed 30mi (45km) northeast of Port Antonio—60mi (95km) northeast of Kingston—with maximum sustained winds of 120mph (195km/h)—a Category3 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The system subsequently struck Cuba as a Category4 twice before moving over the Gulf of Mexico. It ultimately moved inland over Florida as a Category3 on July10 and dissipated over the Great Lakes eight days later.|$|E

Once further offshore on March27, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center Météo-France in La Réunion classified the system as Disturbance 14. Drifting slowly east, a prominent feeder band developed along the system's eastern side; however, this band disrupted low-level inflow of warm, moist air and suppressed convection over the circulation center.|$|E

5|$|The {{extremely}} {{short distance}} of the eyewall of Hurricane Danny from a Doppler radar station in Mobile, Alabama and its slow landfall {{over the course of}} a day led to further study by meteorologists. The proximity to land allowed for measurements at a level closer to the surface than it is possible for hurricane reconnaissance aircraft to achieve, with the slow landfall allowing for more extended observation. One conclusion of the study included the need to sample the boundaries of an eyewall more to establish a better estimate of surface-level winds and the overall intensity of a storm. Another conclusion was that while Danny's slow movement positioned it over a tidal estuary bordering the Gulf, maintaining of or increase in strength was possible since eyewall convection remained over waters with <b>high</b> <b>sea</b> surface temperatures and other environmental conditions remained favorable.|$|E

5|$|The {{meteorological}} {{history of}} Hurricane Dennis spanned twenty-two days, beginning with its inception as a tropical wave over Africa on June26, 2005, and terminating with its dissipation on July18 over the Great Lakes of North America. The incipient wave that became Dennis emerged over the Atlantic Ocean on June29 and moved briskly to the west. Dry air initially inhibited development, though once this abated the wave {{was able to}} consolidate into a tropical depression on July4. The depression soon crossed Grenada before entering the Caribbean Sea whereupon increasingly favorable environmental factors, such as low wind shear and <b>high</b> <b>sea</b> surface temperatures, fueled intensification. Turning west-northwest, the system achieved tropical storm status on July5 and hurricane status the following day.|$|E

A mountain-building event known as the Indosinian orogeny uplifted Precambrian rocks to form four major landmasses on the South China Block: Khamdian to the west, Jiangnan in the centre, Yunkai to the south, and Cathaysia to the east. Island chains also stretched between Yunkai and Cathaysia in the east. Located between Khamdian and Jiangnan was a deep oceanic basin known as the Nanpanjiang Basin. Along the western edge of this basin, fossil-bearing sediments were laid down to become what are now the Lagerstätten (sedimentary deposits characterized by exemplary preservation) of Panxian, Luoping, and other localities.|$|E
5|$|All such {{episodes of}} severe drought {{correlate}} with El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events.

Nevertheless, ENSO events that have coincided with abnormally <b>high</b> <b>sea</b> surfaces temperatures in the Indian Ocean—in one instance during 1997 and 1998 by up to —have resulted in increased oceanic evaporation, resulting in unusually wet weather across India. Such anomalies have occurred during a sustained warm spell {{that began in the}} 1990s. A contrasting phenomenon is that, instead of the usual high pressure air mass over the southern Indian Ocean, an ENSO-related oceanic low pressure convergence centre forms; it then continually pulls dry air from Central Asia, desiccating India during what should have been the humid summer monsoon season. This reversed air flow causes India's droughts. The extent that an ENSO event raises sea surface temperatures in the central Pacific Ocean influences the extent of drought.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the center}} of Gustav passed just {{to the east of}} Cape Hatteras, areas of North Carolina and southeastern Virginia {{experienced}} heavy rain and tropical storm force winds. Parts of the Outer Banks received 2–5inches (50–125mm) of rain and winds of up to 50mph (80km/h), and the Coast Guard station at Cape Hatteras reported a wind gust of 78mph (125km/h). The storm produced storm surges of 3– along the Outer Banks, and 1– along the southeastern coast of Virginia. These surges, combined with strong winds and <b>high</b> <b>sea</b> swells, resulted in minor flooding, mainly in Ocracoke and Hatteras Village, North Carolina. A weak waterspout also touched down on Silver Lake near Ocracoke and moved onshore, but only minor roof damage was reported. Sporadic power outages were also reported.

5|$|Although {{the system}} had a {{partially}} exposed low-level circulation center, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) as the depression {{was likely to}} intensify as it was situated over <b>high</b> <b>sea</b> surface temperatures and in a favorable environment. However, by September4, wind shear quickly increased and dislocated all of the convection associated with the depression {{from the center of}} circulation. This led to the JTWC canceling their TCFA as the environment was no longer favorable for development. The following day, the JTWC declared that the system had dissipated and was no longer a suspect area for tropical cyclone development as the system was virtually stationary off the coast of Vietnam. The JMA, on the other hand, continued to monitor the cyclone as a tropical depression. Although previously declaring that the system dissipated early on September6, the JTWC began monitoring the re-developing system later that day. Convective banding had reformed, wind shear had decreased and the cyclone had less interaction with land as it slowly moved further into the South China Sea. However, late on September8, both agencies declared that the depression had dissipated off the coast of Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|For several hours, steady {{strengthening}} {{continued as}} the depression maintained a westward track. Operationally, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Julia early on September13, though post-analysis confirmed {{the storm had}} reached winds of 40mph (65km/h) twelve hours after formation. For several hours, no significant change occurred in its intensity or organization as Julia passed near Cape Verde, though the storm gradually retraced to the west-northwest along the southern periphery of a deep-layer ridge. Slow intensification resumed as the storm bypassed the Cape Verde islands; by early September14, it displayed a ragged, banded eye-like feature in satellite imagery. Due to locally <b>high</b> <b>sea</b> surface temperatures of about 28°C (82°F), a period of rapid intensification subsequently commenced; within hours, Julia attained Category 1 hurricane status. Though located over an area with relatively low oceanic heat content, Julia continued to intensify rapidly under low vertical wind shear and over favorable sea surface temperatures; as such, the hurricane was upgraded to Category2 status on September 15. In less than two hours, the hurricane deepened to reach Category3 intensity, becoming the fourth major hurricane of the season. The rapid intensification trend continued, and Julia eventually strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane six hours later. Based on satellite estimates, its winds peaked at 140mph (220km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 948mbar (hPa; 27.99inHg), though operationally estimated at 135mph (215km/h) and 950mbar (hPa; 28.05inHg), respectively.|$|E
40|$|This {{article will}} {{consider}} the broad geopolitical considerations in measures towards biodiversity conservation and governance of <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> areas. Traditionally, international law has provided for jurisdiction based upon flag State in <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> areas, and States have shown themselves reluctant to depart from this model. International organisations with responsibility for <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> living resource management have proven, in many cases, to be of limited utility in the sustainable management of <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> resources. This traditional norm of flag State jurisdiction, while still dominant, is now being joined {{by the use of}} supra-national management in the context of regional fisheries organisations under the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement. Part of the reason for this limited effectiveness is the focus of individual States on national interest, which may undermine international cooperation. The paper explores what mechanisms exist within international law that would permit a more effective management of <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> biodiversity conservation, and how these may be used to combat the erosion of the effectiveness of measures by individual State interests.

The current management regime of <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> fisheries lacks the necessary enforcement apparatus, which makes it necessary to apply trade sanctions, port measures and blacklisting to support regulations of <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> fisheries.

5|$|Hurricane Blanca was the {{earliest}} recorded tropical cyclone {{to make landfall}} in Baja California in any given year. Forming as a tropical depression on May31, Blanca initially struggled to organize due to strong wind shear. However, once this abated, the system took advantage of <b>high</b> <b>sea</b> surface temperatures and ample moisture. After becoming a tropical storm on June1, Blanca rapidly intensified on June2–3, becoming a powerful Category4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale; maximum sustained winds reached 145mph (230km/h) at this time. The hurricane's slow motion resulted in tremendous upwelling of cooler water, resulting {{in a period of}} weakening. Blanca gradually recovered from this and briefly regained Category4 status on June6 as it moved generally northwest toward the Baja California peninsula. Cooler waters and increased shear again prompted weakening on June7 and the system struck Baja California Sur on June8 as a weak tropical storm.

5|$|Hurricane Sandra was the latest-forming major {{hurricane}} in {{the northeastern}} Pacific basin, the strongest November Pacific hurricane on record, and the record eleventh major hurricane of the 2015 season. Originating from a tropical wave, Sandra was first classified as a tropical depression on November23 well south of Mexico. Environmental conditions, including <b>high</b> <b>sea</b> surface temperatures and low wind shear, were highly conducive to intensification and the storm quickly organized. A small central dense overcast developed atop the storm and Sandra reached hurricane status early on November25 after the consolidation of an eye. Sandra reached its peak intensity as a Category4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale with winds of 150mph (240km/h) and a pressure of 934mbar (hPa; 27.58inHg) early on November26. This made Sandra the strongest November hurricane on record in the Northeastern Pacific. Thereafter, increasing shear degraded the hurricane's structure and weakening ensued. Rapid weakening took place on November27 and Sandra's circulation became devoid of convection as it diminished to a tropical storm that evening. The cyclone degenerated into a remnant low soon thereafter and ultimately dissipated just {{off the coast of}} Sinaloa, Mexico, on November29.|$|E
