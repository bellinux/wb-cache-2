5|$|Zinfandel {{is grown}} across the {{continental}} United States, although California grows the largest proportion. U.S. producers make wine in styles {{that range from}} late harvest dessert wines, rosés (White Zinfandel) and Beaujolais-style light reds to big hearty reds and <b>fortified</b> <b>wine</b> {{in the style of}} port. The quality and character of American Zinfandel wines largely depend on the climate, location, and age of the vineyard in which they are grown, as well as the technology employed by the winemaker.|$|E

50|$|Flavored <b>fortified</b> <b>wines</b> are {{inexpensive}} <b>fortified</b> <b>wines</b> {{that typically}} have an alcohol content between 13% and 20% alcohol by volume (ABV). They are usually made of grape and citrus wine, sugar, and artificial flavor.|$|R
50|$|Dessert {{wines are}} sweet wines {{typically}} served with dessert. There {{is no simple}} definition of a dessert wine. In the UK, a dessert wine {{is considered to be}} any sweet wine drunk with a meal, as opposed to the white <b>fortified</b> <b>wines</b> (fino and amontillado sherry) drunk before the meal, and the red <b>fortified</b> <b>wines</b> (port and madeira) drunk after it. Thus, most <b>fortified</b> <b>wines</b> are regarded as distinct from dessert wines, but some of the less strong <b>fortified</b> white <b>wines,</b> such as Pedro Ximénez sherry and Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise, are regarded as honorary dessert wines. In the United States, by contrast, a dessert wine is legally defined as any wine over 14% alcohol by volume, which includes all <b>fortified</b> <b>wines</b> - and is taxed at higher rates as a result. Examples include Sauternes and Tokaji Aszú.|$|R

25|$|In 1916, Norway {{prohibited}} distilled beverages, and in 1917 {{the prohibition}} {{was extended to}} also include <b>fortified</b> <b>wine</b> and beer. The wine and beer ban was lifted in 1923, and in 1927 the ban of distilled beverages was also lifted.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{wide range}} of lesser known groups that are used to feed the country's still robust {{distilled}} spirits and <b>fortified</b> <b>wine</b> industry. These grapes usually produce bland, neutral wine that lends itself well to blending and distillation but is rarely seen as varietal bottlings. These include: Belies, False Pedro, Kanaän, Raisin blanc, Sultana and Servan.|$|E

In the United States, by contrast, a dessert wine is legally defined as any wine over 14% alcohol by volume, which includes all <b>fortified</b> <b>wines</b> - and is taxed more highly as a result. This dates back to a time when the US wine industry only made dessert wines by fortification, but such a classification is outdated now that modern yeast and viticulture can produce dry wines over 15% without fortification, yet German dessert wines can contain half that amount of alcohol.|$|R
25|$|Smaller {{amounts of}} Syrah {{are also used}} in the {{production}} of other wine styles, such as rosé wine, <b>fortified</b> <b>wine</b> in Port wine style, and sparkling red wine. While Australian sparkling Shiraz traditionally have had some sweetness, a number of Australian winemakers also make a full-bodied sparkling dry Shiraz, that contains the complexity and sometimes earthy notes that are normally found in still wine.|$|E
25|$|Madeira is a <b>fortified</b> <b>wine</b> {{made in the}} {{portuguese}} Madeira Islands, {{off the coast of}} Africa. Madeira is produced in a variety of styles ranging from dry wines which can be consumed on their own as an aperitif to sweet wines usually consumed with dessert. Cheaper cooking versions are often flavoured with salt and pepper for use in cooking, but these are not fit for consumption as a beverage.|$|E
25|$|Germany {{produces}} wines in many styles: dry, semi-sweet {{and sweet}} white wines, rosé wines, red wines and sparkling wines, called Sekt. (The only wine style not commonly produced is <b>fortified</b> <b>wine.)</b> Due to the northerly {{location of the}} German vineyards, the country has produced wines quite unlike any others in Europe, many of outstanding quality. Between the 1950s and the 1980s German wine was known abroad for cheap, sweet or semi-sweet, low-quality mass-produced wines such as Liebfraumilch.|$|E
50|$|The only {{group of}} wines that sold well were the <b>fortified</b> dessert <b>wines.</b> Taxed {{at the lower}} rate of wine as opposed to {{distilled}} spirits, but with 20% alcohol, this group made the cheapest intoxicant available. Before 1920, table wines accounted for 3 of every 4 gallons shipped. After 1933, <b>fortified</b> <b>wines</b> were 3 of every 4 gallons shipped. It was not until 1968 that table wines sales finally overtook <b>fortified</b> <b>wines,</b> regaining the status of most popular wine category.|$|R

25|$|While the Barossa Valley is most {{commonly}} associated with its signature grape variety of Shiraz, the region does grow a number of grape varieties. Among these other varieties are Riesling, Semillon, Chardonnay, Grenache, Mourvedre and Cabernet Sauvignon. The popularity of Syrah has sparked interest {{in the development of}} other Rhone varieties, with increase production of Grenache and Mourvedre (also known as Mataro in Australia) for both blending and varietal bottlings. Many of these vines are remnants of the Barossa's <b>fortified</b> <b>wine</b> history and such have substantial age themselves.|$|E
25|$|A {{risk factor}} {{involved}} with fermentation {{is the development}} of chemical residue and spoilage which can be corrected with the addition of sulfur dioxide (SO2), although excess SO2 can lead to a wine fault. A winemaker who wishes to make a wine with high levels of residual sugar (like a dessert wine) may stop fermentation early either by dropping the temperature of the must to stun the yeast or by adding a high level of alcohol (like brandy) to the must to kill off the yeast and create a <b>fortified</b> <b>wine.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{temperature}} of {{service is a}} criterion to put wine in the best condition for drinking. The wine must be chilled but not be served with ice. Between 8 and 9°C, the chill will accentuate the liveliness of the bubbles and reduce the sweetness of a sweet or <b>Fortified</b> <b>wine.</b> For an aromatic dry wine service between 10 and 12°C stimulates vivacity and gives freshness to the flavours. Finally, the great white wines are best at a temperature between 12 and 14°C which allows the flavours and the structure to be revealed.|$|E
25|$|By 1924, nearly 95% of all {{vineyard}} owners {{belonged to}} the KWV, allowing it to exert enormous power on the pricing structure {{and direction of the}} South African wine industry. The KWV was able to regulate planting rights for new vineyard properties, specify permitted grape varieties, limit harvest yields, regulate production methods and impose quotas on how much wine needed to be distilled for <b>fortified</b> <b>wine</b> production. While the activities of the KWV was able to stabilize the South African industry, it also stagnated the industry by limiting innovation and improvements in quality. This stagnation was compounded by the isolation South Africa experienced during the Apartheid era.|$|E
25|$|Heavy metal {{contamination}} {{is thought}} to be a contributing factor in Beethoven's death as these were commonly used in medicines of the time. It has also been theorized that he consumed large amounts of lead from illegally <b>fortified</b> <b>wine.</b> Putting lead sugar into wine was a very common practice to sweeten cheap wines, and despite being outlawed in most European countries during the 18th century, the prohibition was difficult to enforce and production of lead-fortified wine (which originated in Roman times) continued unabated. There is no indication the composer had syphilis beyond a mercury treatment prescribed to him around 1815, but these were used for various other ailments as well.|$|E

Others include Chenin blanc and Mauzac, {{which is also the}} principal grape in {{the sparkling}} Blanquette de Limoux. The sweet <b>fortified</b> <b>wines</b> of the Muscat de Frontignan and Muscat de St-Jean Minervois regions are made with the Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains grapes.

50|$|Boal {{is a name}} {{given to}} several {{varieties}} of grape cultivated in Portugal, notably {{in the production of}} medium-rich <b>fortified</b> <b>wines</b> from Madeira Island. On many wine labels of Madeira wine, the variety's name is anglicized as Bual. Madeira from Bual is typically less sweet than that from Malmsey, but more sweet than Sercial or Verdelho. The vines are also common in Portugal and Spain, where the fruit is used in the same way for <b>fortified</b> <b>wines.</b>|$|R
25|$|Another pivotal figure {{during this}} period was Maurice O'Shea of Mount Pleasant vines in the Pokolbin area. While many {{producers}} in Australia were focusing on <b>fortified</b> <b>wine,</b> O'Shea continued to espouse the virtue of Australian dry table wines. O'Shea's foresight would pay off as consumer taste shifted towards drier styles of wine in the 1950s and 1960s. A flurry of plantings began in the Hunter, including 1963 establishment of Lake's Folly by a Sydney surgeon, Dr. Max Lake. Along with Rudy Komon, Johnny Walker and wine columnist Len Evans, who all believed {{in the future of}} the Australian wine industry, Lake begin to extensively plant red wine varietals, including the reintroduction of Cabernet Sauvignon to the Hunter Valley.|$|E
25|$|The Worcester {{district}} {{is responsible for}} more wine than any other wine region {{in the country with}} one fifth to one quarter of the entire South African yearly wine production coming from this area. Located just beyond Du Toit's Peak in the Breede River Valley, Worcester includes a broad fertile plain that relies on irrigation due to its dry, arid climate. The area's large and numerous co-operatives produce sizeable amounts of <b>fortified</b> <b>wine</b> as well as Muscadel and Hanepoot based dessert wines. In recent years, the Slanghoek ward and the Breedekloof district have been successful growing botrytised and dry Sauvignon blanc wines. The Worcester {{district is}} home to nearly half of all the Semillon, and a third of Ruby Cabernet, planted in South Africa with sizeable plantings of Colombard and Chenin blanc.|$|E
25|$|Portuguese wines {{were first}} shipped to England in the 12th century from the Entre Douro e Minho region (which today {{includes}} modern Portuguese wine regions {{such as the}} douro and vinho verde). In 1386, Portugal and England signed the Treaty of Windsor which fostered close diplomatic {{relations between the two}} countries and opened the door for extensive trade opportunities. The 1703 Methuen Treaty furthered advanced English economic interest in Portugal by reducing tariffs and giving Portuguese wines preferential treatment in the British wine market over French wines. Around this time, the <b>fortified</b> <b>wine</b> known as port was increasing in popularity in Britain. The lucrative trade in Port prompted the Portuguese authorities to establish one of the world's first protected designation of origin when Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, Marquis of Pombal established boundaries and regulations for the production of authentic Port from the Douro in 1756.|$|E
50|$|Distillation of {{the wine}} into pisco began in earnest {{around the turn of}} the 17th century, perhaps in {{response}} to these pressures. Until the early 18th century, however, most aguardiente was still primarily used to <b>fortify</b> <b>wine,</b> in order to prevent its oxidation, rather than drunk on its own. This method of conservation corresponds with <b>fortified</b> <b>wines</b> that were shipped to Italy and Spain from other parts of the world (e.g. wines from Madeira and Marsala).|$|R
