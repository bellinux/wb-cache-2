25|$|Major {{improvement}} {{to transport}} and communication systems brought crucial developments. The railways reduced {{the time and}} cost of travel and improved reliability in transporting cotton to the Lancashire towns. The Liverpool Cotton Brokers’ Association was established in 1841 and it quickly established a successful system of arbitration. The Transatlantic Telegraph Cable reduced long distance communication from weeks to minutes. Liverpool broker John Rew recognised the far-reaching implications of this development and created the hedge fund system. This led to the hugely successful Liverpool Cotton <b>Futures</b> <b>Market,</b> which doubled {{the business of the}} Liverpool Cotton Market. In 1911-12 Liverpool imported 5,230,399 bales of cotton.|$|E

After the War the Raw Cotton Commission became the sole importer and distributor of cotton. The Cotton Market reopened in 1954, but as a shadow of its former self. In 1963 the Liverpool Cotton Association successfully reinvented itself and re-energised its membership, concentrating on the provision of specialist services such as arbitration. The association became increasingly global in its outlook and this was reflected in its name change in 2004 to the International Cotton Association.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the effects of the current global crisis on the {{integration}} and co-movements of selected stock index <b>futures</b> <b>markets.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Time series techniques of cointegration and weekly data covering the period from January 2001 to December 2009 were used in this study. The period of analysis was divided into two periods, namely the pre-crisis period (January 2001 -July 2007) and during crisis period (August 2007 -December 2009). Findings – No evidence was found of cointegration among the stock index <b>futures</b> <b>markets</b> in both periods. Accordingly, the 2007 subprime crisis does not seem to affect the long-run co-movements among the stock index <b>futures</b> <b>markets.</b> Practical implications – The stock index <b>futures</b> <b>markets</b> provide opportunity for the potential benefits from international portfolio diversification and hedging strategies even after the subprime crisis. The stock index futures significantly extended the variety of investment and risk management strategies available to investors. Originality/value – Examining the effects of the US subprime crisis on the stock index <b>futures</b> <b>markets</b> integration, to the best of the authors' knowledge, goes clearly beyond the existing literature on the subject matter. <b>Futures</b> <b>markets,</b> Market integration, Portfolio diversification, Portfolio investment, Stock index <b>futures</b> <b>markets,</b> Subprime crisis, United States of America...|$|R

25|$|Future {{contracts}} are another way our farmer can hedge his risk without {{a few of}} the risks that forward contracts have. Future {{contracts are}} similar to forward contracts except they are more standardized (i.e. each contract is the same quantity and date for everyone). These contracts trade on exchanges and are guaranteed through clearinghouses. Clearinghouses ensure that every contract is honored and they take the opposite side of every contract. Future contracts typically are more liquid than forward contracts and move with the market. Because of this, the farmer can minimize the risk he faces in the future through the selling of future contracts. Future contracts also differ from forward contracts in that delivery never happens. The exchanges and clearinghouses allow the buyer or seller to leave the contract early and cash out. So tying back into the farmer selling his wheat at a future date, he will sell short futures contracts for the amount that he predicts to harvest to protect against a price decrease. The current (spot) price of wheat and the price of the futures contracts for wheat converge as time gets closer to the delivery date, so in order to make money on the hedge, the farmer must close out his position earlier than then. On the chance that prices decrease in the future, the farmer will make a profit on his short position in the <b>futures</b> <b>market</b> which offsets any decrease in revenues from the spot market for wheat. On the other hand, if prices increase, the farmer will generate a loss on the <b>futures</b> <b>market</b> which is offset by an increase in revenues on the spot market for wheat. Instead of agreeing to sell his wheat to one person on a set date, the farmer will just buy and sell futures on an exchange and then sell his wheat wherever he wants once he harvests it.|$|E
25|$|The ETF {{tracking}} error {{is the difference}} between the returns of the ETF and its reference index or asset. A non-zero {{tracking error}} therefore represents a failure to replicate the reference as stated in the ETF prospectus. The tracking error is computed based on the prevailing price of the ETF and its reference. It is different than the premium/discount which {{is the difference between}} the ETF’s NAV (updated only once a day) and its market price. Tracking errors are more significant when the ETF provider uses strategies other than full replication of the underlying index. Some of the most liquid equity ETFs tend to have better tracking performance because the underlying is also sufficiently liquid, allowing for full replication. In contrast, some ETFs, such as commodities ETFs and their leveraged ETFs, do not necessarily employ full replication because the physical assets cannot be stored easily or used to create a leveraged exposure, or the reference asset or index is illiquid. Futures-based ETFs may also suffer from negative roll yields, as seen in the VIX <b>futures</b> <b>market.</b>|$|E

500|$|As {{the flowers}} grew in popularity, {{professional}} growers paid {{higher and higher}} prices for bulbs with the virus, and prices rose steadily. By 1634, in part {{as a result of}} demand from the French, speculators began to enter the market. The contract price of rare bulbs continued to rise throughout 1636, but by November, the price of common, [...] "unbroken" [...] bulbs also began to increase, so that soon any tulip bulb could fetch hundreds of guilders. That year the Dutch created a type of formal <b>futures</b> <b>market</b> where contracts to buy bulbs {{at the end of the}} season were bought and sold. Traders met in [...] "colleges" [...] at taverns and buyers were required to pay a 2.5% [...] "wine money" [...] fee, up to a maximum of three guilders per trade. Neither party paid an initial margin nor a mark-to-market margin, and all contracts were with the individual counter-parties rather than with the Exchange. The Dutch described tulip contract trading as windhandel (literally [...] "wind trade"), because no bulbs were actually changing hands. The entire business was accomplished on the margins of Dutch economic life, not in the Exchange itself.|$|E
500|$|The {{first year}} in his new job as {{administrative}} dean at Louisiana State went smoothly. The Middletons had a new house built on Highland Road near the campus, and an oil field was discovered under their property, bringing them royalties that would pay for their property many times over. University enrollment began to climb in 1938 and the LSU football team had just finished three outstanding seasons under coach Bernie Moore, winning 27 of their 30 regular season games. Middleton was photographed breaking ground for a new faculty club that year, as the campus grew in many areas. [...] All seemed to be running well when in June 1939 the campus was given a shock from which it would take many years to recover. A New Orleans newspaper ran a photo {{on the front page}} showing an LSU truck unloading building materials in suburban New Orleans, revealing an illegal operation.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores {{issues related}} to efficiency, how efficiently markets transmit information, of non-genetically modified (GM) soybean and conventional soybean <b>futures</b> <b>markets</b> at the Tokyo Grain Exchange (TGE). ^ The first manuscript examines how efficiently non-GM and conventional soybean <b>futures</b> <b>markets</b> react to an announcement to change the contract unit, suppliers, and expiration date on the conventional soybean contract. Box and Tiao 2 ̆ 7 s intervention analysis is used for this purpose. The result reveals that the price premium for non-GM soybeans (the price {{difference between the two}} soybean contracts) and the volumes of non-GM soybeans increase after the announcement and this effect remained after the announcement. Hence the two soybean <b>futures</b> <b>markets</b> did not respond quickly to the announcement and there was an informational inefficiency after the change occurred. ^ The second manuscript explores the market linkages between the non-GM and conventional soybean, and the corn <b>futures</b> <b>markets</b> at the TGE in the presence of unknown breaks. Bai-Perron multiple structural change test and Johansen cointegration tests are used for this purpose. The results reveal that cointegration relationships exist between the two soybean futures prices and between the non-GM soybean and corn futures prices. Yet the breaks found in the soybean <b>futures</b> <b>markets</b> affected these price linkages, and there were periods where the two soybean and corn <b>futures</b> <b>markets</b> were not efficient. ^ The third manuscript tests if the two soybean <b>futures</b> <b>markets</b> fully reflect available information by testing the market efficiency of the two soybean <b>futures</b> <b>markets.</b> This manuscript also investigates the causality of this long-run relationship to find out if it is the spot price or the futures price that first incorporates new information into the market. Johansen cointegration tests are used for these purposes. The results suggest that both non-GM and conventional soybean <b>futures</b> <b>markets</b> are efficient but the non-GM soybean market is inefficient compared to the conventional soybean market. The test on the causality of the long-run relationship showed that both of the soybean <b>futures</b> <b>markets</b> are led by the spot price for the spot and futures prices to move together in the long-run. ...|$|R
