40|$|Motivated by the tantalizing excesses {{recently}} {{reported in the}} di-photon invariant mass spectrum at the LHC, we scrutinize some implications of scalar di-photon resonances in high energy proton-proton collisions. In particular, <b>indications</b> <b>of</b> a large <b>width</b> impose several challenges for model building. We show how calculability and unitarity considerations severely limit possible perturbative realizations of such a signal and propose a simple criterion that {{can be adapted to}} any renormalizable model. Furthermore, we discuss correlations between a di-photon excess and precision observables, including the anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments of quarks and leptons, neutral meson oscillations and radiative flavor changing neutral current mediated decays of heavy leptons and hadrons. We find that existing searches and measurements significantly constrain the possibilities for a scalar resonance decaying into final states involving Standard Model fermions. We propose future search strategies which could elucidate some remaining currently unconstrained decay channels and discuss possible correlations between the di-photon excess and several {{recently reported}} flavor anomalies, showing that the latter can be addressed in a new incarnation of a gauged U(1) ^' model, with the di-photon resonance being the physical remnant of the U(1) ^'-breaking field.

30|$|Currently, various {{computational}} {{methods are}} available for processing the image data of the oil film experiments [9 – 15]. However, these methods still have obvious defects, such as resulting in great errors or requiring extensive pre-processing. Decker and Naughton [10] developed an automated method using a windowed Fourier transform and a correlation technique capable of locating fringes in an image. But the technique is only able to identify approximately 70 % of the fringes in the image. White [11] and Dunn [12] processed the data based on a regression fit of a sinusoidal model and took {{the period of the}} data as the <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the fringes. The problem of regression method is that it uses a string of data to generate only one value. In addition, since the regression would be compromised when there is imperfection with the pattern of data, or there is a global variation of brightness or contrast between dark and bright fringes, the requirement for quality of database is rather high. On the other hand, Lunte and Schülein [13] and Andrew Baldwin et al. [14] used fast Fourier transform (FFT) to calculate the frequency of oscillation in the data, but this method also encounters similar problems as the regression method since it is as well suffering {{from the fact that the}} data is not always the same as ideally predicted. Bottini et al. [15] identified the fringes by binarizing the image and took the middle line of the binarized fringes as the location of bright and dark images. However, this method requires a proper choice to binarize the data. It is similar to the two methods introduced above, in taking the “middle lines” for later calculation of distance; it requires that the light intensity of each bright section is symmetric about the peaks. But since the real case is always not so, some bad binarization would strongly affect the accuracy of the final results.|$|R
40|$|In Doppler radar {{analysis}} of the atmosphere the spectrum width is rarely used but it contains information about turbulence. Turbulence {{is not the only}} effect that contributes to the broadening of the spectrum. Another effect is the cross-beam wind, which can be dominant in broad-beam radars such as wind profilers. Once this effect is removed, the so-called residual width then serves as an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> turbulence. A large snowstorm is used in this study for the computation <b>of</b> the residual <b>width.</b> Strong wind and wind shear were observed during the storm. The time-height pattern <b>of</b> residual <b>width</b> bears a close resemblance to that of wind shear. This supports the interpretation <b>of</b> the residual <b>width</b> as being an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> turbulence induced by wind shear. Energy dissipation rates are also estimated for the snowstorm. In some regions values as large as 800 cm$ rm sp 2 s sp{- 3 }$ are observed. These are large, but within the range of what has been reported by others. The same techniques were applied to the study of clear-air turbulence to relate radar reflectivity with turbulence...|$|R
40|$|Filaments in Herschel {{molecular}} cloud images {{are found to}} exhibit a "characteristic width". This finding is in tension with spatial power spectra of the data, which show no <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> this characteristic scale. We demonstrate that this discrepancy {{is a result of}} the methodology adopted for measuring filament widths. First, we perform the previously used analysis technique on artificial scale-free data, and obtain a peaked <b>width</b> distribution <b>of</b> filament-like structures. Next, we repeat the analysis on three Herschel maps and reproduce the narrow distribution <b>of</b> <b>widths</b> found in previous studies $-$ when considering the average <b>width</b> <b>of</b> each filament. However, the distribution <b>of</b> <b>widths</b> measured at all points along a filament spine is broader than the distribution <b>of</b> mean filament <b>widths,</b> indicating that the narrow spread (interpreted as a "characteristic" width) results from averaging. Furthermore, the width is found to vary significantly from one end of a filament to the other. Therefore, the previously identified peak at 0. 1 pc cannot be understood as representing the typical <b>width</b> <b>of</b> filaments. We find an alternative explanation by modelling the observed width distribution as a truncated power-law distribution, sampled with uncertainties. The position of the peak is connected to the lower truncation scale and is likely set by the choice of parameters used in measuring filament widths. We conclude that a "characteristic" <b>width</b> <b>of</b> filaments is not supported by the available data. Comment: 15 pages (incl. appendices), 16 figures, accepted to MNRA...|$|R
