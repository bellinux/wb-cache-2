40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 28 - 31, 1985 / Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas, NevadaCommand Destruct Receivers {{are used}} on all launch {{vehicles}} {{for the purpose}} of initiating flight termination. The up-link command signal is a UHF carrier frequency modulated with Inter-Range Instrumentation Group (IRIG) audio tones. Typically three commands are used to control and terminate the flight: ARM, DESTRUCT, and OPTIONAL command. The combination and sequence of specified IRIG tones determines the command to be issued. The decoder portion of the command destruct receiver determines the presence and sequence of IRIG tones. Through the use of a microprocessor and digital signalprocessing-technology, Cincinnati Electronics has designed and developed a <b>digital</b> <b>decoder</b> which detects four IRIG tones simultaneously. The <b>digital</b> <b>decoder</b> provides stabilities and repeatabilities unattainable with analog decoders. Reliability and reproducibility are also superior when using the digital approach through the elimination of select and variable components. This improved performance of the decoder is a result of crystal controlled digital filtering and a constant false-alarm rate provided by the microprocessor. The digital filtering is achieved through Finite Impulse Response digital filters. There are a number of additional features provided by the <b>digital</b> <b>decoder.</b> Self-testing of portions of the receiver and correcting for temperature drift can be performed by the <b>decoder.</b> The <b>digital</b> <b>decoder</b> can have its command sequences reprogrammed in the field allowing separate control and termination of each vehicle in a multiple vehicle launch. Also, acceptance test data, date of manufacture, total time unit has been powered up, and other data can be stored inside the Command Destruct Receiver and recalled when needed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:This paper {{presents}} a 5 -bit ash analog-to-digital converter design using the 0. 18 -m Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's CMOS technology library. The designed system consists of 2 main blocks, a comparator array, and a <b>digital</b> <b>decoder.</b> The <b>digital</b> <b>decoder</b> contains a latch, 1 -of-N decoder, and fat-tree encoder units. The 1 -of-N decoder is implemented using 2 1 multiplexers. As a result, the active die {{area and the}} power consumption are reduced, {{in addition to an}} increase in the sampling frequency. The power supply voltage range for the overall system is 0. 9 V. For testing purposes, a ramp signal of between { 0. 45 V and 0. 7 V is applied to the converter input.
