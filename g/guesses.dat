30|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that challenge questions can be vulnerable to <b>guessing</b> attacks by friends and colleagues [20, 25]. Just and Aspinall [22] describe <b>guessing</b> in three categories, which are “Blind guessing”, “Focused Guessing” and “Observation”. In blind <b>guessing,</b> the attacker performs a brute-force attack without considering the question. In focused <b>guessing,</b> the attacker may still use a brute-force technique, however, the search space is cut down by considering the question type. In observation, the attacker performs an informed <b>guess</b> about both the user and question. Schechter [20] performed <b>guessing</b> attacks by acquaintances and statistical <b>guessing</b> {{in the context of}} credential recovery to evaluate security of challenge questions. We organised an informed <b>guessing</b> (observation) abuse case scenario in the context of online learning and examinations using the PBAF method. This study does not cover blind and focused <b>guessing.</b> The abuse case was performed to assess risks and mitigate any security threat using the method defined by ISO 31000 [30].|$|R
5|$|These four {{created and}} tested all the {{elements}} of the Thin Man design between April 1943 and August 1944. Parsons, who had developed the proximity fuze for the Navy, ran the division, and handled liaison with other agencies. As the head of the E-6 Projectile, Target, and Source Group, Critchfield calculated critical masses, and instituted a system of live testing with scale models using 20 mm cannon and 3-inch guns. While full-scale Thin Man tubes took months to produce, these were readily and easily obtained. It was not possible to conduct tests with plutonium, as it was not yet available. Indeed, the actual physical characteristics of the metal were little more than educated <b>guesses</b> at this time.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the bonus}} round begins, the winning {{contestant}} chooses {{one of three}} categories {{for his or her}} puzzle (prior to season 35, the puzzle and category were predetermined). After doing so, the contestant spins a smaller wheel with 24 envelopes to determine the prize. He or she is then shown a puzzle in the chosen category, and every instance of R, S, T, L, N, and E is revealed. The contestant provides three more consonants (four if he/she is holding the Wild Card) and one more vowel, then has 10 seconds to solve the puzzle after his or her other letters (if any) are revealed. The contestant may make as many <b>guesses</b> as necessary, so long as the contestant begins the correct answer before time expires. Whether or not the contestant solves the puzzle, the host opens the envelope {{at the end of the}} round to reveal the prize at stake. Prizes in the bonus round include various cash amounts (with the lowest being the season number multiplied by $1,000), a vehicle (or two vehicles during weeks with two-contestant teams), and a top prize of $100,000.|$|E
5|$|Iodine oxides are {{the most}} stable of all the halogen oxides, because of the strong I–O bonds {{resulting}} from the large electronegativity difference between iodine and oxygen, {{and they have been}} known for the longest time. The stable, white, hygroscopic iodine pentoxide (I2O5) has been known since its formation in 1813 by Gay-Lussac and Davy. It is most easily made by the dehydration of iodic acid (HIO3), which it is the anhydride of. It will quickly oxidise carbon monoxide completely to carbon dioxide at room temperature, and is thus a useful reagent in determining carbon monoxide concentration. It also oxidises nitrogen oxide, ethylene, and hydrogen sulfide. It reacts with sulfur trioxide and peroxydisulfuryl difluoride (S2O6F2) to form salts of the iodyl cation, +, and is reduced by concentrated sulfuric acids to iodosyl salts involving +. It may be fluorinated by fluorine, bromine trifluoride, sulfur tetrafluoride, or chloryl fluoride, resulting iodine pentafluoride, which also reacts with iodine pentoxide, giving iodine(V) oxyfluoride, IOF3. A few other less stable oxides are known, notably I4O9 and I2O4; their structures have not been determined, but reasonable <b>guesses</b> are IIII(IVO3)3 and +− respectively.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is psychometric and {{psychological}} analysis of <b>guessing</b> on entrance examinations, and especially evaluation of classical procedure for reducing <b>guessing</b> which has been used at Department of psychology in Novi Sad, which consisted of instruction against <b>guessing</b> and correction with Abbott formula. As first, we have tried to estimate <b>guessing</b> in several ways, according to classical test theory and item response theory. Besides of analysis of association between different indicators of <b>guessing,</b> we have performed a special form of criterion analysis, by correlating possible indicators of <b>guessing</b> with several personality traits. Basic conclusion of this paper is that <b>guessing</b> is not consistent behavior and because of this it is very hard to measure and eliminate it. The next conclusion is that the applied classical procedure has not been able to eliminate <b>guessing,</b> and that it probably disfavored several candidates...|$|R

When Jason arrives to collect Number 18, Mama tells him she is dead and offers a refund. Believing Number 18 is still alive, Jason becomes violent. Mama mocks him, saying the Western culture he is part of is hedonistic and responsible for people in the Third World being sexually trafficked. Jason stops short of hurting Mama and leaves to report to Marta. Through her connections, Marta discovers that Number 18 is alive.

5|$|The CM Division was {{responsible}} for the purification and fabrication of materials for the bomb, including the core, tamper and initiator. The chemistry and metallurgy of uranium was fairly well known, although it did yield a few surprises, but that of plutonium was almost completely unknown. The element had only been discovered a short time before, and existed only in microgram amounts. Educated <b>guesses</b> about its chemistry tended to be wrong, and as research progressed it was found to have unusual properties, including no less than six allotropes. There was rivalry between its discoverers, with Wahl and Kennedy's group at Los Alamos competing with Seaborg's in Chicago to produce the best process for purifying the metal. This competition ended abruptly when Segrè's group at Los Alamos discovered that high levels of a hitherto undiscovered plutonium-240 isotope in reactor-produced plutonium meant that an implosion-type nuclear weapon was required, and a high degree of purity was therefore unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Snow and the Huntsman walk {{together}} in the forest, and she sees through his disguise and correctly <b>guesses</b> that he was sent by the Queen to kill her. Snow flees, but as the Huntsman catches up with her, he finds her writing a letter, which she requests he deliver to the queen after she is killed. The Huntsman takes out his knife, but instead of killing her, he fashions a whistle out of a bamboo stick, telling her that it will summon help and then telling her to run. The Huntsman then returns to the queen with a deer heart, hoping that she will not know the difference. The queen asks him to read her the letter, which is an apology for past wrongs {{as well as a}} request from Snow that her stepmother rule the kingdom with compassion. The queen burns the letter and takes the box with the heart in it to store in her vault. When she cannot open one of her storage safes, it proves that the Huntsman lied to her; the heart is not human. The Queen has her guards drag him down to the vault and she yanks his glowing heart out of his body. She tells the Huntsman that from now on he will be her pet and will do her bidding forever, and if he ever betrays her, all she has to do is squeeze.|$|E
40|$|Low {{frequency}} {{words at}} two different densities {{in a text}} were replaced by nonsense words. The {{subjects were asked to}} <b>guess</b> the meanings of these words by using context clues. The results were analysed to see what factors affected difficulty of <b>guessing.</b> Words in the low density text (1 unknown word in 25) were easier to <b>guess</b> than words in the high density text (1 word in 10). Verbs were easier to <b>guess</b> than nouns, which were easier than adverbs and adjectives. The subjects were divided into proficiency levels according to their success at <b>guessing.</b> Groups of learners at high proficiency levels could successfully <b>guess</b> 85 % to 100 % of the unknown words. The group of learners at the lowest proficiency level tested <b>guessed</b> be-tween 30 % and 40 % of the unknown words. From the results, it seems that learning the word <b>guessing</b> skill is best done by the class as a whole rather than individually. At first learners should work on verbs and nouns with plenty of understand-able context. Research needs to be done on the effects of repetition on <b>guessing,</b> the types of words that learners need to <b>guess,</b> and the effect of teaching on improvement of the <b>guessing</b> skill...|$|R
