Many different designs have been proposed [1]-[3] and implemented in monolithic form [4], [5]. The strategy used in all of these coders is to adapt the "step size" of the coder to suit the input signal power. In the present paper we examine a class of unity bit coders where a basic linear coder is used while the input to this coder is constrained or compressed to be within suitable limits, so as to have the linear coder operating in its optimal range. Results are presented for <b>delta</b> <b>modulators,</b> deltasigma modulators, and a modified unity bit coder, and it is found that some of the coders perform as well as the "conventional" adaptive <b>delta</b> <b>modulators...</b>|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2003 This thesis {{presents}} a continuous time bandpass <b>delta</b> sigma <b>modulator</b> with frequency translation inside the delta sigma loop. The input IF signal is down converted to baseband after amplification by a low Q, wideband bandpass resonator. The down converted IF signal is digitized by a continuous time, second order lowpass <b>delta</b> sigma <b>modulator.</b> The {{output of the}} lowpass <b>delta</b> sigma <b>modulator</b> is upconverted and fedback in to the low Q wideband bandpass resonator. Unlike the conventional <b>delta</b> sigma <b>modulators,</b> sinusoidal pulses are used for feedback. The system level design of the frequency translating <b>delta</b> sigma <b>modulator</b> is discussed. A prototype frequency translating <b>delta</b> sigma <b>modulator</b> to digitize IF signals at 100 MHz was designed in CMOS 0. 35 μm process. Transistor level simulation shows that 80 dB SNR is achievable at a power dissipation of 100 mW. The frequency translating <b>delta</b> sigma <b>modulator</b> is less sensitive to time delay jitter in the DAC feedback pulse. If we use edge triggered sinusoid pulses for feedback, the DAC jitter performance of frequency translating <b>delta</b> sigma <b>modulator</b> will be better than that of conventional bandpass <b>delta</b> sigma <b>modulator...</b>|$|R

This system was in service throughout the 1980s.

Thereafter the summing interval, sigma count and buffered count are produced using appropriate counters and registers. The Vin waveform is approximated by passing the countstream (g) into a low pass filter, however it suffers from the defect discussed {{in the context of}} Fig. 1a. One possibility for reducing this error is to halve the feedback pulse length to half a clock period and double its amplitude by halving the impulse defining resistor thus producing an impulse of the same strength but one which never butts onto its adjacent impulses. Then there will be a threshold crossing for every impulse. In this arrangement a monostable flip flop triggered by the comparator at the threshold crossing will closely follow the threshold crossings and thus eliminate one source of error, both in the ADC and the sigma <b>delta</b> <b>modulator.</b>|$|E

An algorithm is described which was employed in the design of an adaptive delta modulation. The algorithm is extremely inexpensive to implement and features extremely desirable characteristics such as a 40 db dynamic range and a 90 percent non-redundant word intelligibility at a bit rate of 9. 6 kb/s. A new concept is presented in delta modulation design, the nth-order <b>delta</b> <b>modulator.</b> The nth order <b>delta</b> <b>modulator</b> increases the maximum SNR of a <b>delta</b> <b>modulator</b> but not its dynamic range. It is shown that a 2 nd order <b>delta</b> <b>modulator,</b> which employs two delta modulators in cascade, results in a 15 db output SNR improvement over a linear <b>delta</b> <b>modulator</b> operating at 27 db.

40|$|A {{well-known}} {{limitation of}} sigma <b>delta</b> <b>modulators</b> is {{the generation of}} limit cycle oscillations for DC and slow varying inputs. These limit cycles give rise to undesired tones at {{the output of the}} modulator which result in the deterioration of the signal to noise ratio (SNR). However, the use of high dither signal amplitude results in raising the in-band noise floor level. Based on the analysis presented in this paper, it is shown that the required dithering amplitude can be minimal depending on the oversampling ratio (OSR). Moreover, a new dither injection technique for sigma <b>delta</b> <b>modulators</b> is presented based on the analysis findings. The proposed circuit effectively eliminates the undesired tonal components of the modulator though the randomization of the comparator's threshold levels.

40|$|Just {{as their}} single-bit counterparts, multi-bit sigma <b>delta</b> <b>modulators</b> exhibit {{nonlinear}} behavior {{due to the}} presence of the quantizer in the loop. In the multi-bit case this is caused by the fact that any quantizer has a limited output range and hence gives an implicit saturation effect. Due to this, any multi-bit modulator is prone to modulator overloading. Unfortunately, until now, designers had to rely on extensive time-domain simulations to predict the overloading level, because there is no adequate analytical theory to model this effect. In this work, we have developed such an analytical theory based on multiple input describing function analysis. This way, we obtained expressions for the signal gain, the noise gain and the variance of the quantization noise. Here, both the case of DC as well as sinusoidal signals was considered. These results were used for the stability analysis of multi-bit Sigma <b>Delta</b> <b>modulators,</b> which allows to predict the overloading level.
