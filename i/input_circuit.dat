25|$|Vacuum Tube Voltmeters or valve {{voltmeters}} (VTVM, VVM) {{were used}} for voltage measurements in electronic circuits where high input impedance was necessary. The VTVM had a fixed input impedance of typically 1megohm or more, usually through use of a cathode follower <b>input</b> <b>circuit,</b> and thus did not significantly load the circuit being tested. VTVMs were used before the introduction of electronic high-impedance analog transistor and field effect transistor voltmeters (FETVOMs). Modern digital meters (DVMs) and some modern analog meters also use electronic input circuitry to achieve high input impedance—their voltage ranges are functionally equivalent to VTVMs. The input impedance of some poorly-designed DVMs (especially some early designs) would vary {{over the course of}} a sample-and-hold internal measurement cycle, causing disturbances to some sensitive circuits under test.|$|E

2500|$|In a cat's whisker {{detector}} {{only certain}} {{sites on the}} crystal surface functioned as rectifying junctions, and the device was very sensitive to {{the pressure of the}} crystal-wire contact, which could be disrupted by the slightest vibration. Therefore, a usable contact point had to be found by trial and error before each use. The operator dragged the wire across the crystal surface until a radio station or [...] "static" [...] sounds were heard in the earphones. [...] Alternatively, some radios (circuit, right) used a battery-powered buzzer attached to the <b>input</b> <b>circuit</b> to adjust the detector. The spark at the buzzer's electrical contacts served as a weak source of static, so when the detector began working, the buzzing could be heard in the earphones. [...] The buzzer was then turned off, and the radio tuned to the desired station.|$|E
50|$|The output {{equation}} is the constant 1 set equal to an expression. This expression {{is a conjunction}} of sub-expressions, where the satisfaction of each sub-expression enforces the proper operation of a single gate in the <b>input</b> <b>circuit.</b> The satisfaction of the entire output expression thus enforces that the entire <b>input</b> <b>circuit</b> is operating properly.|$|E

50|$|The naive {{approach}} is to write the circuit as a Boolean expression, and use De Morgan's law and the distributive property to convert it to CNF. However, this can result in an exponential increase in equation size. The Tseytin transformation outputs a formula whose size has grown linearly relative to the <b>input</b> <b>circuit's.</b>|$|R
50|$|Infinite {{impedance}} uses a non-inverting amplifier with Av = 1. The {{output voltage}} {{is equal to}} the input voltage Vi and completely neutralizes it. Examples are potentiometric null-balance meters and op-amp followers and amplifiers with series negative feedback (op-amp follower and non-inverting amplifier) where the <b>circuit</b> <b>input</b> impedance is enormously increased. This technique is referred to as bootstrapping and is intentionally used in biasing <b>circuits,</b> <b>input</b> guarding <b>circuits,</b> etc.|$|R
50|$|The {{output voltage}} always {{has the same}} sign as the op-amp input voltage {{but it does not}} always have the same sign as the <b>circuit</b> <b>input</b> voltage (the signs of the two input {{voltages}} can differ). When the <b>circuit</b> <b>input</b> voltage is above the high threshold or below the low threshold, the output voltage has the same sign as the <b>circuit</b> <b>input</b> voltage (the <b>circuit</b> is non-inverting). It acts like a comparator that switches at a different point depending on whether the output of the comparator is high or low. When the <b>circuit</b> <b>input</b> voltage is between the thresholds, the output voltage is undefined and it depends on the last state (the circuit behaves as an elementary latch).|$|R
