Each computer is a commercial off-the-shelf purchase which is then modified for safety and operation including updates to connectors, cooling and power to accommodate the station's 28V DC power system and weightless environment. Heat generated by the laptops does not rise but stagnates around the laptop, so additional <b>forced</b> <b>ventilation</b> is required. Laptops aboard the ISS {{are connected to the}} station's wireless LAN via Wi-Fi and to the ground via Ku band. This provides speeds of 10Mbit/s to and 3Mbit/s from the station, comparable to home DSL connection speeds.|$|E
500|$|The line {{acquired}} two new {{vessels in}} 1925, but {{later that year}} its fortunes were adversely affected by competition from subsidised American firms on the North Atlantic routes; ML disposed of seven ships between late 1925 and 1930, reducing its fleet to ten vessels. The Regiment steamed 160 miles through a gale in 1929 to reach the sinking Glasgow steamer Volumnia. A lifeboat was launched to rescue the crew of forty-five. On return home, King George V awarded the Regiment's lifeboat crew the Silver Medal for Gallantry in Saving Life at Sea and Manchester's Lord Mayor presented a silver salver from the Board of Trade to Captain Linton. In 1933, amid the Great Depression, several ships were laid up; the Manchester Merchant of 1904 was disposed of for breaking up and the Manchester Civilian was sold to Greek owners. The public sailing programme for the 1933 summer season listed six ships as allocated to the weekly [...] "Fast Freight Service" [...] to Quebec and Montreal. The six steamers were advertised as being [...] "fitted with fan or <b>forced</b> <b>ventilation</b> and all have cold storage accommodation". Most vessels were also able to carry up to twelve passengers. [...] After a ten-year gap, three new vessels were commissioned between 1935 and 1938 as trade started to recover, maintaining the fleet at ten ships. The trio were equipped with automatic stokers for their coal-fired boilers and had greatly improved accommodation for the passengers and the crew.|$|E

Emissions from dairy houses are 15 % of total agricultural NH 3 emissions. Due to open buildings, existing abatement options are limited. Pit air separation {{was identified as a}} potentially efficacious option. In this study a model simulation of a commercial dairy cow building with slatted floor is presented. The model was solved for 12 cases, differing wind speed, direction and both air and manure temperature. For each case three solutions were obtained, which correspond a) to a building where a <b>forced</b> pit <b>ventilation</b> system is applied at capacity of 250 and 500 m- 3 h- 1 cow- 1 and b) to a building without <b>forced</b> pit <b>ventilation</b> system. The results show that due to <b>forced</b> pit <b>ventilation</b> system, at 250 and 500 m- 3 h- 1 cow- 1, the ventilation rate was increased 3. 1 % and 6. 2 % respectively. The contribution of the pit ventilation system to the total ammonia released from the pit during winter, ranged from 31 - 35 %, 16 - 19 % and 11 - 8 %, for wind speed of 1. 0, 4. 0 and 8. 0 m s- 1 respectively. Correspondingly, during summer, the contribution of the system ranged from 44 - 48 %, 20 - 21 % and 12 - 9 %. Although obvious benefits arise from a <b>forced</b> pit <b>ventilation</b> system, the main mass flow of ammonia from the pit still emitted through the building ventilation openings, especially at high wind speeds...|$|R

The destruction of microorganisms {{through the use of}} dry heat is a gradual phenomenon. With longer exposure to lethal temperatures, the number of killed microorganisms increases. <b>Forced</b> <b>ventilation</b> of hot air can be used to increase the rate at which heat is transferred to an organism and reduce the temperature and amount of time needed to achieve sterility. At higher temperatures, shorter exposure times are required to kill organisms. This can reduce heat-induced damage to food products.|$|E
2500|$|The forts' {{mission was}} to delay the {{progress}} of an enemy for the time required for the Belgian Army to mobilise. Left to themselves, the forts were planned to resist a siege for about a month, based on estimates made in 1888. In 1914 the forts were completely outclassed by the much more powerful German artillery, which included the enormous Big Bertha 42cm howitzer. [...] It was therefore a surprise that the forts resisted as long and as successfully as they did.
