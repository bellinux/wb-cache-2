5|$|Born in Barstow, California, Tyler {{moved to}} Oceanside, California where he starred as halfback at El Camino High School.

5|$|Despite only {{finishing}} {{fifth in}} the Scottish League in 1955, Hibs {{were invited to participate}} in the first season of the European Cup, which was not strictly based on league positions at that time. Eighteen clubs who were thought would generate interest across Europe and who also had the floodlights necessary to play games at night, were invited to participate. Floodlights had been used at Easter Road for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> friendly match against Hearts on 18 October 1954. Hibs became the first British club in Europe because the Football League secretary Alan Hardaker persuaded Chelsea, the English champions, not to enter.|$|E

5|$|In {{the face}} of a looming crisis in his career, Wills {{admitted}} to throwing in his 1870–71 Australian Cricketers' Guide, and in so doing taunted his enemies to stop him. Nonetheless, he was made Victoria XI captain for the March 1871 intercolonial against New South Wales, held at the Albert Ground. Wills' first innings top score of 39* was offset by his drunken behaviour in the field and his apparent reluctance to bowl for fear of being called. Victoria won by 48 runs. Not long after, Wills was no-balled for throwing for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> club match. Rumour spread that the umpire had conspired against him with the opposing club's owner.|$|E

5|$|Sure, it's not a Sepultura reunion, {{but having}} Max and Igor {{performing}} on {{record for the}} <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dozen years {{is as close as}} we'll ever get, and not only does Cavalera Conspiracy's Inflikted revisit the post-thrash sounds of 1993's Chaos A.D., but it manages to outshine anything Sepultura has put out in the last dozen years. Rounded out by Soulfly lead guitarist Marc Rizzo and, most impressively, Gojira frontman Joe Duplantier on bass and rhythm guitar, the band is as solid a metal supergroup as you'll ever come across, and the album's eleven tracks benefit hugely from the chemistry between the four musicians.|$|E
5|$|The Bearcats {{opened the}} 2008 college {{football}} season against , winning 40–7 in an offensive effort led by senior quarterback Dustin Grutza, {{who was named}} the team's starter at that position following Mauk's dismissal.

Billboard posters, newspapers and magazines were employed in addition to motion pictures. Telemarketers were used to make phone calls with scripted dialogues to promote Harding.|$|E
