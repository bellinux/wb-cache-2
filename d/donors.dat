40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the results of laparoscopic <b>donor</b> {{nephrectomy}} with open <b>donor</b> nephrectomy. Methods: A non-randomized prospective analysis was conducted of living <b>donor</b> kidney transplantations (118 open <b>donor</b> nephrectomies; 57 laparoscopic <b>donor</b> nephrectomies) between January 2005 and December 2007 in the Kidney Transplantation Unit of Hospital das Clínicas of Faculdade de Medicina of the Universidade de São Paulo. Results: Mean <b>donor</b> operative time, mean <b>donor</b> hospital stay, mean postoperative creatinine values, and rates of complications and graft survival were similar for both groups. A significant statistical difference in warm ischemia time was observed between the open <b>donor</b> nephrectomy and laparoscopic <b>donor</b> nephrectomy groups (p < 0. 001). There was only one conversion in the laparoscopic <b>donor</b> nephrectomy group. Conclusions: Laparoscopic <b>donor</b> nephrectomy is a safe procedure for a <b>donor</b> nephrectomy, comparable to an open procedure with similar results despite a longer warm ischemia time...|$|R

5|$|Bacteria {{are further}} divided into lithotrophs that use {{inorganic}} electron <b>donors</b> and organotrophs that use organic compounds as electron <b>donors.</b> Chemotrophic organisms use the respective electron <b>donors</b> for energy conservation (by aerobic/anaerobic respiration or fermentation) and biosynthetic reactions (e.g., carbon dioxide fixation), whereas phototrophic organisms use them only for biosynthetic purposes. Respiratory organisms use chemical compounds {{as a source}} of energy by taking electrons from the reduced substrate and transferring them to a terminal electron acceptor in a redox reaction. This reaction releases energy {{that can be used to}} synthesise ATP and drive metabolism. In aerobic organisms, oxygen is used as the electron acceptor. In anaerobic organisms other inorganic compounds, such as nitrate, sulfate or carbon dioxide are used as electron acceptors. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims at {{explaining the}} donors’ {{trust in the}} charity organizations {{within the context of}} an emerging charity sector. Such knowledge would help these organizations influence <b>donor</b> trust and participation. Four key factors were identified and used to propose a model of <b>donor</b> trust: organization’s reputation, <b>donor’s</b> familiarity with the charity sector, <b>donor’s</b> perception of the organization’s opportunism and <b>donor’s</b> perception of the organization’s communication effectiveness. The model is tested in an emerging charity sector in a Latin American country, Chile. Three factors have a direct effect on <b>donor</b> trust, whereas one factor, communication effectiveness, has only an indirect effect through its influence on the organization’s reputation and <b>donor’s</b> familiarity with the sector. While organization’s reputation and <b>donor’s</b> familiarity with the sector influence <b>donor</b> trust positively, perceived opportunism impacts upon it negatively. The comprehensive and, at the same time, parsimonious donor-trust model that is contributed in this study helps explain how <b>donor</b> trust is generated, kept and enhanced. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDonor T-cells {{can provide}} a graft-versus-leukemia effect and help to promote <b>donor</b> {{engraftment}} after allogeneic BMT; however, these benefits can be outweighed by {{the ability of the}} cells to induce life-threatening GVHD. Photochemical treatment (PCT) of T-cells with S- 59 psoralen and long-wavelength UV-A light can inhibit their proliferative capacity and significantly decrease their ability to induce acute GVHD after allogeneic BMT. PCT <b>donor</b> T-cells have been shown to facilitate <b>donor</b> engraftment in a myeloablative BMT model. In this study, we examined whether <b>donor</b> T-cells subjected to PCT ex vivo could retain the ability to facilitate engraftment or increase <b>donor</b> chimerism after nonmyeloablative BMT or after establishment of mixed hematopoietic chimerism. In a transplantation model in which mice were conditioned for BMT with sublethal (600 cGy) TBI, an infusion of PCT <b>donor</b> T-cells was unable to facilitate engraftment of <b>donor</b> BM. A BMT model was used in which a mixture of allogeneic and syngeneic marrow cells was infused into lethally irradiated recipients for establishment of mixed hematopoietic chimerism. The goal was to determine whether PCT <b>donor</b> splenocytes could increase levels of <b>donor</b> chimerism. Recipients of splenocytes treated with UV-A light only (no S- 59 psoralen) and given at the time of BMT or in a <b>donor</b> lymphocyte infusion (DLI) had significantly higher levels of <b>donor</b> chimerism than did recipients of BM only. Although PCT <b>donor</b> splenocytes given at the time of BMT modestly increased <b>donor</b> chimerism, PCT <b>donor</b> splenocytes given in a DLI did not increase <b>donor</b> chimerism. A nonmyeloablative BMT model was employed for determining whether DLI given relatively late after BMT could increase <b>donor</b> chimerism. Recipient mice were conditioned for BMT with a combination of low-dose TBI (50 or 100 cGy) and anti-CD 154 (anti-CD 40 L) monoclonal antibody for achievement of low levels of mixed chimerism. When control mixed chimeras were given a DLI 71 days after BMT, <b>donor</b> chimerism was significantly increased. In contrast, PCT of the <b>donor</b> cells eliminated the ability of the cells to increase <b>donor</b> chimerism after infusion. Together results from these 3 distinct BMT models indicate that PCT of <b>donor</b> T-cells significantly inhibited the ability of the cells to facilitate <b>donor</b> engraftment after nonmyeloablative BMT or to increase <b>donor</b> chimerism in mixed hematopoietic chimeras when the cells were administered in a DLI.

When the <b>donor</b> is divided into a driver <b>donor</b> and a driven <b>donor,</b> the degree of overdrive in a driven <b>donor</b> varies with the <b>donor</b> pressure ratio. There must be a greater degree of overdrive in the driven <b>donor</b> for re-initiation of a detonation wave in the acceptor, particularly if the initial pressure in the driven <b>donor</b> is lower than the Chapman–Jouguet pressure in the acceptor.

In addition, we compared the clinical outcome between ABOi-KT and ABO compatible KT (ABOc-KT) from spousal <b>donor,</b> and performed a Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to define the risk factors affecting the allograft outcomes. The introduction of ABOi-KT increased overall living <b>donor</b> KT by 12. 2 % and its portion was increased from 0. 3 % to 21. 7 % during study period. The ABOi-KT in living unrelated KT was two times {{higher than that of}} living related <b>donor</b> KT (17. 8 vs. 9. 8 %). Spousal <b>donor</b> was a major portion of living unrelated KT (77. 6 %) and ABOi-KT increased spousal donation from 10 % to 31. 5 % in living <b>donor</b> KT. In addition, increasing rate ABOi-KT from spousal <b>donor</b> was 10 times higher than that of living related <b>donor.</b> The clinical outcome (incidence of acute rejection, allograft function, and allograft and patient survival rates) of ABOi-KT from spousal <b>donor</b> was comparable to that of ABOc-KT.

40|$|Background: The risk {{of death}} after <b>donor</b> {{hepatectomy}} for living <b>donor</b> liver transplantation (LDLT) is unknown, {{because of the lack}} of a sufficient database to accurately determine the rate of this infrequent, but devastating outcome. In the absence of an accurate estimate of <b>donor</b> death, the medical literature contains anecdotal reports of <b>donor</b> deaths which in some cases are based on verbal reports, circularly references or unsubstantiated data. Because <b>donor</b> death is one of the most important outcomes of LDLT, we performed a comprehensive survey of the medical and lay literature to provide a better estimate of the total number of worldwide <b>donor</b> deaths. Methods: We reviewed all published articles from PubMed which reported <b>donor</b> outcomes from 1989 to February 2006 and the lay literature (using Google. com and www. refdesk. com/paper. html). We classified each death as “definitely,” “possible” or “unlikely” related to <b>donor</b> surgery. Results: There were 19 documented <b>donor</b> deaths and 1 <b>donor</b> in a chronic vegetative state (2 years after surgery), as shown in the Table. Thirteen and one additional vegetative <b>donor</b> were “definitely”, 2 were “possibly” and 4 were “unlikely” related to <b>donor</b> surgery. The estimated total number of LDLT’s performed worldwide is 7087. The estimated rate of <b>donor</b> death “definitely” related to <b>donor</b> surgery is 13 / 7087 or 0. 18 % and the rate of <b>donor</b> death which is “definitely” (13 patients) or “possibly” (2 patients) related to the <b>donor</b> surgery is 15 / 7087 or 0. 21 %. The most common cause of “definite” deaths was sepsis (5), liver failure (2), unknown (2), MI, CVA, pulmonary embolus and peptic ulcer (1 each) which occured at a (median/mean) 11 / 38 days after surgery. Conclusions: This analysis provides: 1) a source document of all identifiable living liver <b>donor</b> deaths, 2) a better estimate of <b>donor</b> death rate and 3) an impetus for centers with unreported deaths to submit these outcomes to the liver transplantation community. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
