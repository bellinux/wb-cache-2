5|$|Alcibiades was {{a leading}} {{supporter}} of the Sicilian Expedition, and scholars have argued that, had that expedition been under Alcibiades's command instead of that of Nicias, the expedition might not have met its eventual disastrous <b>fate.</b> <b>In</b> the years when he served Sparta, Alcibiades {{played a significant role}} in Athens's undoing; the capture of Decelea and the revolts of several critical Athenian subjects occurred either at his suggestion or under his supervision. Once restored to his native city, however, he played a crucial role in a string of Athenian victories that eventually brought Sparta to seek a peace with Athens. He favored unconventional tactics, frequently winning cities over by treachery or negotiation rather than by siege. Alcibiades's military and political talents frequently proved valuable to whichever state currently held his allegiance, but his propensity for making powerful enemies ensured that he never remained in one place for long; and by the end of the war which he had helped to rekindle in the early 410s, his days of political relevance were a bygone memory.|$|E
5|$|As Karlsruhe steamed to Barbados on {{the night}} of 4 November, a {{spontaneous}} internal explosion destroyed the ship. The hull was split in half; the bow section quickly sank and took with it Köhler and most of the crew. The stern remained afloat long enough for 140 of the ship's crew to escape onto the attending colliers. Commander Studt, the senior surviving officer, took charge and placed all of his men aboard the liner Rio Negro. He scuttled the second collier and steamed north for Iceland. The ship used the cover of a major storm to slip through the British blockade of the North Sea, and put in at Ålesund, Norway. Rio Negro then returned to Germany by early December. The Admiralstab, unaware of the loss of Karlsruhe, coincidentally radioed the ship to order her to return to Germany. Germany kept the loss of the ship a secret, and the British continued searching for her until they learned of her <b>fate</b> <b>in</b> March 1915. Köhler's widow christened the cruiser Karlsruhe, the third to bear the name, at her launching in August 1927.|$|E

5|$|In a later review, McNulty praised scenes {{like the}} one in which Sasuke admits his crimes and agrees to go to prison, as it showed {{acceptance}} of responsibility for his misdeeds. McNulty also praised Sasuke's later journey of self-redemption, as well as his decision to respond to Sakura's feelings for him before leaving. IGN's Ramsey Isler considered Sasuke's change of heart drastic, but felt it was a fitting conclusion for the character after the series' events, and fit well with him once again leaving the village, this time on good terms with his friends and the village. Manga author Hiroaki Samura was pleased with Sasuke's character arc in the series, especially his influence on Naruto and {{the fact that in the}} end he returns to Konohagakure because of Naruto. While finding Sasuke's <b>fate</b> <b>in</b> the manga's ending predictable, McNulty felt that the character's monologue after his final fight with Naruto helped to show a deeper side to him.|$|E
5|$|Polish {{literature}} faced {{a similar}} <b>fate</b> <b>in</b> territories annexed by Germany, where {{the sale of}} Polish books was forbidden. The public destruction of Polish books {{was not limited to}} those seized from libraries, but also included those books that were confiscated from private homes. The last Polish book titles not already proscribed were withdrawn in 1943; even Polish prayer books were confiscated. Soon after the occupation began, most libraries were closed; in Kraków, about 80% of the libraries were closed immediately, while the remainder saw their collections decimated by censors. The occupying powers destroyed Polish book collections, including the Sejm and Senate Library, the Przedziecki Estate Library, the Zamoyski Estate Library, the Central Military Library, and the Rapperswil Collection. In 1941, the last remaining Polish public library in the German-occupied territories was closed in Warsaw. During the war, Warsaw libraries lost about a million volumes, or 30% of their collections. More than 80% of these losses were the direct result of purges rather than wartime conflict. Overall, it is estimated that about 10million volumes from state-owned libraries and institutions perished during the war.|$|E

5|$|Gaia was {{the mother}} of the Titans and {{embodiment}} of Earth. At the request of Zeus' mother Rhea, Gaia raised and protected the young Zeus to prevent Cronos from devouring him, as he had devoured his other children.

In God of War II, she saved Kratos from the Underworld after a disastrous encounter with Zeus, and directed the Spartan to find the Sisters of <b>Fate</b> <b>in</b> order to take revenge on Zeus. A successful Kratos plucked Gaia and the Titans from the moment in time before their defeat in the Great War to launch an abortive attack on Olympus. In God of War III, Gaia was wounded in the assault on Olympus and abandoned Kratos, stating he was a pawn of the Titans so that they could have their revenge. Kratos eventually found and crippled Gaia, but she returned and interrupted the final battle between the Spartan and Zeus. The pair entered Gaia's neck wound, and with the Blade of Olympus, Kratos destroyed her heart, killing the Titan.|$|E

40|$|How do {{intercellular}} {{signals that}} pattern cell <b>fates</b> vary <b>in</b> evolution? During nematode vulva development, precursor cells acquire {{one of three}} <b>fates</b> <b>in</b> a pattern centered around the gonadal anchor cell. Non-vulval fates are at the periphery, outer and inner vulval fates are towards the center. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the three fates are specified {{around the same time}} by an induction by the anchor cell and lateral signaling between the vulva precursor cells. We find that, in three other nematode species (Panagrolaimus, Oscheius and Rhabditella spp.) spanning two families, the centered pattern is obtained by two temporally distinct gonadal inductions. The first induction specifies vulval fates; the second induction specifies the inner vulval <b>fates</b> <b>in</b> a subset of the precursors’ daughters. This evolutionary change in the spatiotemporal connectivity of cell interactions allows centering of the pattern between two precursors in Panagrolaimus...|$|R

5|$|Some time later, Suzuha appears before Rintarō, having {{arrived in}} a time machine from the future. She tells Rintarō {{that the only way}} to prevent World War III in the future is to prevent Kurisu's death at the hands of her father, Dr. Nakabachi, who stole her time travel theory to publish it under his own name. However, this {{operation}} ends in a disaster as Rintarō ends up killing Kurisu himself by mistake. After this failure, Rintarō receives a message from his future self, telling him that the way to save Kurisu without altering the events that led to him developing a time machine is to fool his past self into believing Kurisu had been killed and thus achieving the final divergence value of 1.048596%, which he dubs the 'Steins Gate'. Returning to the past again, Rintarō puts his own life in danger in order to save Kurisu's life, prevent Nakabachi from successfully escaping with the time travel theory, and fool his past self, setting him on his journey through time. Returning to the Steins Gate world line, safe from the threat of a third world war, Rintarō and Kurisu manage to reunite by chance (or by <b>fate)</b> <b>in</b> the streets of Akihabara.|$|E
5|$|The killings were methodical. After the {{condemned}} individual's personal information was checked and approved, he was handcuffed {{and led to}} a cell insulated with stacks of sandbags along the walls, and a heavy, felt-lined door. The victim was told to kneel {{in the middle of the}} cell, and was then approached from behind by the executioner and immediately shot in the back of the head or neck. The body was carried out through the opposite door and laid in one of the five or six waiting trucks, whereupon the next condemned was taken inside and subjected to the same <b>fate.</b> <b>In</b> addition to muffling by the rough insulation in the execution cell, the pistol gunshots were also masked by the operation of loud machines (perhaps fans) throughout the night. Some post-1991 revelations suggest that prisoners were also executed in the same manner at the NKVD headquarters in Smolensk, though judging by the way that the corpses were stacked, some captives may have been shot while standing on the edge of the mass graves. This procedure went on every night, except for the public May Day holiday.|$|E
5|$|This grudge came to {{the fore}} in 906, when Samonas tricked Andronikos into refusing to {{participate}} in an imperial expedition. Afraid that he would be punished for his disobedience, Andronikos with his family and retainers fled to the fortress of Kabala, near Iconium, and thence across the border into exile in the Abbasid Caliphate. Constantine and his father ended up in Baghdad, the Abbasid capital. Leo sent a secret message to the Doukai, offering a full pardon if they returned, but again through the machinations of Samonas, the letter fell into the hands of Caliph al-Muktafi (r. 902–908), who had Andronikos confined to house arrest and forced to convert to Islam along with those who had followed him. He died there in ca. 910. Constantine however managed to escape Baghdad, and was warmly welcomed back by Leo in a ceremony in the throne room of the Chrysotriklinos. The date of his return to Byzantium is unclear, but must be placed between ca. 908 and ca. 911. Despite his father's revolt, the Doukai remained very popular due to their military successes, and prophecies apparently circulated that predicted Constantine's rise to the throne. As a result, according to Theophanes Continuatus, Leo warned the young man from trying to become emperor, but this is probably a later interpolation in view of Constantine Doukas' eventual <b>fate.</b> <b>In</b> reality, Leo seems to have trusted him, for he showered him with gifts and appointed him to senior military positions: initially he was named—apparently in succession to Eustathios Argyros —strategos of the Charsianon theme, but by 913 he had risen to the post of Domestic of the Schools (commander-in-chief of the army). From both positions he fought victoriously against the Arabs.|$|E

Here {{we show that}} activation of the canonical BAR- 1 β-catenin pathway of Wnt signaling alters the competence of P(3 – 8). p and specifies ectopic HCG-like fates. This fate transformation requires the Hox gene mab- 5. In addition, misexpression of mab- 5 in P(1 – 8). p is sufficient to establish HCG competence among these cells, {{as well as to}} generate ectopic HCG <b>fates</b> <b>in</b> combination with LIN- 12 or EGF signaling.

Lastly, wild-type mab- 5 function is necessary for normal P(9 – 11). p fate specification, indicating that regulation of ectopic HCG <b>fate</b> formation revealed <b>in</b> anterior Pn. p cells reflect mechanisms of pattern formation during normal hook development...|$|R
