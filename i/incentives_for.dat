First, an increase in the cost of R&D reduces the <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> a firm to do R&D. Secondly, an increase in the cost of technology adoption or an increase in the market interest rate reduces the <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> a firm to adopt new technology and also reduces the <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> a firm to do R&D.

The <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> technology licensing is stronger under decentralized unions.

If the centralized union decides whether or not to supply workers to all firms, the possibility of higher innovation under decentralized unions increases. We further show that perfectly substitutable workers can be better off under decentralized unions if the labor productivity depends on the unionization structure, which occurs in our analysis when, e. g., licensing after innovation occurs only under decentralized unions or innovation (with no licensing) occurs only under a centralized union.

40|$|In theory, {{monopsony}} at {{one stage}} in a vertically related market provides an <b>incentive</b> <b>for</b> backward integration into the adjacent competitive stages.

5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century Scottish {{agriculture}} became susceptible to world markets. There were dramatic price rises in the First World War, but a slump in the 1920s and 1930s, followed by more rises in the Second World War. In 1947 annual price reviews were introduced {{in an attempt to}} stabilise the market. There was a drive in UK agriculture to greater production until the late 1970s, resulting in intensive farming and increasing mechanisation. The UK joined the European Economic Community in 1972. Some sectors became viable only with subsidies. A series of reforms to the Common Agricultural Policy from the 1990s attempted to control over-production, limit <b>incentives</b> <b>for</b> intensive farming and mitigate environmental damage. A dual farm structure emerged with large commercial farms and small pluralised and diversified holdings.|$|E

5|$|As the Allied victory {{began to}} look certain, Keynes was heavily involved, {{as leader of the}} British {{delegation}} and chairman of the World Bank commission, in the mid-1944 negotiations that established the Bretton Woods system. The Keynes-plan, concerning an international clearing-union, argued for a radical system for the management of currencies. He proposed the creation of a common world unit of currency, the bancor, and new global institutions – a world central bank and the International Clearing Union. Keynes envisaged these institutions managing an international trade and payments system with strong <b>incentives</b> <b>for</b> countries to avoid substantial trade deficits or surpluses. The USA's greater negotiating strength, however, meant that the final outcomes accorded more closely to the more conservative plans of Harry Dexter White. According to US economist J. Bradford DeLong, on almost every point where he was overruled by the Americans, Keynes was later proved correct by events.|$|E
