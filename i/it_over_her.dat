25|$|On November 19 Ayman al-Zawahiri {{carried out}} {{an attack on}} the Egyptian Embassy in Pakistan, and the suitor Ahmed had {{arranged}} for his daughter went into hiding, named as one of the conspirators. A warrant was sworn for Khadr's arrest eight days later, after it was discovered that Khalid Abdullah had purchased one of the vehicles used in the attack. Two dozen Pakistani went to his house on November 27 at approximately 23:00H, but he was still in Afghanistan and had been there since before the attacks. Maha barricaded the door, while the 15-year-old Zaynab took her father's rifle and held <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> head screaming. The police managed to enter, and took his wife, three children and in-laws who were visiting from Canada, into custody while they searched the house, seizing $10,000 $29,000 or $40,000 in cash from the home. While he insisted the money was to pay the salaries of HCI workers, others alleged he had used HCI to launder money eventually used to finance the attack. His wife and children were released shortly after the raid, while his in-laws were held for a month before being released.|$|E
500|$|... "I Stay in Love" [...] is a [...] "beat-driven" [...] and [...] "piano-laced" [...] ballad, that is {{influenced}} by pop and R music genres. The song's instrumentation is derived from a piano melody, and is backed by a strong computerized drum-beat. It is composed in the key of D major, with Carey's vocals spanning from the low note of D3 to the high note of G5. The song moves at a slow tempo of 65 beats per minute in cut time, and it follows a chord progression of D–Bm7–G–A. [...] The song features a [...] "double voice" [...] effect during its final chorus, where Carey's normal singing tone {{throughout the rest of}} the song is combined with her raised pitch. She raises the pitch one octave, and layers <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> normal tone. Lyrically, the song finds Carey getting [...] "her cry on with the connect-the-dots break-up track." [...] She describes the old time she shared with her lover. She also admits that even though they did attempt to save their relationship, and that she knows that it is definitely over, she still [...] "stays in love with him".|$|E
500|$|As {{the final}} verse {{of the song}} begins, a soaked Madonna, wearing the same black lingerie, like a {{stalking}} cat, is shown crawling on the floor among her furniture, like under the table with lightning flashing, along with a brief scene through a clear globe held up by 3 male statues, the scene interspersed with Madonna sitting on a sofa and smoking. The worker ultimately gets up from his steel bed and, carrying Madonna's cat, walks towards Madonna's room as she reaches for a bowl of milk, and licks it like a cat. She pours <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder and it reaches the worker's face, who travels up the building in an elevator, holding her cat, on a quest to return it. A boxing/wrestling match starts among the other workers of the factory, as a seemingly vulnerable Madonna, acting like a cat, is now shown sitting naked on her bed. The worker reaches her room, returns her cat, takes her into his arm, and makes love to her as the door closes behind them. The owner of the factory using the same monocle glass sees the empty position where the worker was {{and looks up at}} both the worker and Madonna, who are having sex. He seems to have lost control of the factory and Madonna with another man, but he doesn't mind. The video ends with a last shot of the city-line, with Madonna's eyes above the sky, and over the city which may show that she had control all along, and the epigraph on top of a series of gears. It ends with a quote, [...] "Without the heart, there can be no understanding between the hand and the mind".|$|E
60|$|I ran {{and brought}} the wrap. She {{arranged}} <b>it</b> carefully <b>over</b> <b>her</b> head.|$|R

60|$|She shook {{back her}} hair and then let <b>it</b> spread <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulders}} in luxuriant curls.|$|R
2500|$|In other ceremonies, a young woman, {{sometimes}} {{the daughter of}} a highly respected man, would be placed on top of a mound of blankets. [...] This mound would match her height. [...] Sitting on top of the blankets, a ceremony would take place around here, while she sat on top of and her family nearby. [...] During some ceremonies, people situated around the house would take wooden batons and beat on plank drums situated through the house. [...] When a young girl would stand up, she would dance around the house with a shawl on, and everyone else would beat and sing. [...] When she was done, one man would take down, from duck, swan, or eagle, and sprinkle <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|She flung <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{shoulder}} and danced around the kitchen.|$|E
60|$|He put <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{head as he}} spoke, and {{she blushed}} deeply, but did not refuse it.|$|E
60|$|She {{could not}} submit to this. She felt <b>it</b> swooning <b>over</b> <b>her.</b> But {{she could not}} submit.|$|R
60|$|But {{she did not}} start, {{even when}} Ben had shaken out the new duster and laid <b>it</b> neatly <b>over</b> <b>her</b> knees.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Jobson took a {{book from}} his pocket, and opening it at a certain page, handed <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|Biddy now {{pulled her}} cloak from off her head, settled <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulders, and {{prepared}} for telling a good substantial story.|$|E
60|$|Dipping her {{handkerchief}} in cold water, {{and passing}} <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> {{eyes as she}} left the room, she instantly hastened to her sister.|$|E
6000|$|... "They'll {{take their}} turn after YOU," [...] he said grimly, {{picking up a}} wrap from the railing and {{throwing}} <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulders.|$|E
60|$|Her rage got {{the better}} of her again, for a moment; but <b>it</b> passed <b>over</b> <b>her</b> face like a spasm, and left her smiling.|$|R
60|$|The pretty old lady, {{after reading}} it, had just laid it {{down upon the}} breakfast-cloth. She handed <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to <b>her</b> son.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the brother}} of the king dragged Soa to the couch, and {{throwing}} her down upon <b>it</b> stood <b>over</b> <b>her,</b> his spear-point at her throat.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind, Miss," [...] she said, an unbidden tear rolling down her cheek as she {{surveyed}} the garment and folded <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> breast.|$|E
6000|$|... "Na faags," [...] {{replied the}} gypsy {{out of the}} cloak. [...] "Really, Mr. Dishart, you had better not ask," [...] she added, {{replacing}} <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|But Sakr-el-Bahr, {{cool and}} undaunted before that royal anger, took the scarf that lay about Rosamund's shoulders, and raising it, flung <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> head, {{so that her}} face was covered by it.|$|E
6000|$|... "My cook {{will have}} bought the Evening News," [...] said Castalia, [...] "and Ann will be {{spelling}} <b>it</b> out <b>over</b> <b>her</b> tea. I must go home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I {{will have}} the stone from the temple," [...] cried Hordle John. [...] "What would not my old mother give to have <b>it</b> hung <b>over</b> <b>her</b> bed?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we {{will have}} her there, by all means, dear, if she likes to come; you had better talk <b>it</b> <b>over</b> with <b>her.</b> Ah! here she is.|$|R
60|$|Is <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>her?</b> No! A fierce gust, {{which all}} but hurls the spectators to the ground; the fiery stream sweeps {{away to the}} left, in a grand curve of sparks, and drops into the sea.|$|E
60|$|And mademoiselle, hastily taking from {{a drawer}} a large linen apron, and tying <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> black apron, rushed éperdue into the kitchen, whence, to speak truth, exhaled an odour of {{calcined}} sweets rather strong than savoury.|$|E
60|$|As {{he spoke}} he {{followed}} Phyllis to the nursery, {{and there was}} so much shocked, that he could no longer lord <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>her,</b> but shrinking back, shut himself up in his room, and bolted the door.|$|E
60|$|The rain thudded {{and splashed}} {{on the wooden}} roof. A few drops trickled {{through a crack in}} the boards. He took off his coat, and placed <b>it</b> gently <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulders.|$|R
60|$|It {{was an odd}} wooing, as Tommy laughingly {{told herself}} {{when she came to}} think <b>it</b> <b>over</b> in <b>her</b> room that night. But that is how it shaped itself.|$|R
6000|$|<b>It</b> came <b>over</b> <b>her,</b> {{after he}} had said this, that she had once thought him beautiful. [...] "How much you must {{want to make sure}} of him!" [...] she exclaimed in a moment.|$|R
60|$|Gwendolen did {{not give}} any caresses with her words {{as she had been}} used to do. She did not even look at her mother, but was looking at the {{turquoise}} necklace as she turned <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> fingers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Jean Isbel {{was sweet}} on me, dad ... {{but he will}} never be again," [...] {{returned}} Ellen, in low tones. With that she pulled her saddle off Spades and, throwing <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>her</b> shoulder, she walked off to her cabin.|$|E
60|$|He {{snatched}} {{his knife}} from his pocket, removed the gag from her mouth, and cut all her bonds. Her hands tried nervously to rearrange her dress over her bosom. He tore {{off his own}} coat and threw <b>it</b> <b>over</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Kate here {{put up a}} long-handled eyeglass to {{her fine}} gray eyes, fitted <b>it</b> ostentatiously <b>over</b> <b>her</b> aquiline nose, and then said, in a voice of {{simulated}} horror, [...] "Aunt Huldy,--this revelation is shocking!" ...|$|R
50|$|In 2014, Thanpuying Chanut {{retired from}} the {{position}} of managing director, handing <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to <b>her</b> son, Chanin Donavanik. She is currently serving as the honorary chairperson of Dusit Thani Group.|$|R
