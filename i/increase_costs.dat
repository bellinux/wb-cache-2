5|$|During {{the debate}} in the Parliament of Norway in 1899, it was {{proposed}} that construction be delayed until the Drammen Line was upgraded to standard gauge, but this was rejected by the majority. The plans to build the line were passed on 18 May 1899 and parliament gave a grant of NOK350,800. In 1903, this was supplemented with NOK22,500. Construction started in late 1901 and was led by Engineer E. Richter. No blasting was done, but difficulties arose because of the large amounts of clay, which contributed to <b>increase</b> <b>costs</b> to NOK800,000.|$|E
5|$|Essence is {{used for}} both {{creating}} creatures and casting spells; the number, type and strength of creations {{is limited by the}} player's essence capacity. For instance, if a character with 70 maximum essence summons a creature which costs 20 essence, their maximum essence is reduced to 50 until the creation is destroyed, either through combat or being absorbed by the Shaper to regain essence. A total of 18 different creations are featured in the game, with larger and more powerful creatures costing more essence to create. The types and strengths of creations can be altered depending on the player's combat style. Creations accompanying the player receive a percentage of the experience points received for completing quests or defeating foes, levelling up and receiving skill points {{in the same manner as}} the player character. These skill points can be spent to increase creations' statistics, but every statistic <b>increase</b> <b>costs</b> more essence and reduces the amount of essence available to summon other creations or cast spells. Essence and health are regained from Shaper-designed pools or by entering a friendly town.|$|E

25|$|The {{disadvantages}} of the divisional structure {{is that it}} can support unhealthy rivalries among divisions. This type of structure may <b>increase</b> <b>costs</b> by requiring more qualified managers for each division. Also, there is usually an over-emphasis on divisional more than organizational goals which results in duplication of resources and efforts like staff services, facilities, and personnel.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1940s, {{agricultural}} productivity has increased dramatically, {{due largely to}} {{the increased use of}} energy-intensive mechanization, fertilizers and pesticides. The vast majority of this energy input comes from fossil fuel sources. Between the 1960–65 measuring cycle and the cycle from 1986 to 1990, the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe, with world grain production increasing significantly (between 70% and 390% for wheat and 60% to 150% for rice, depending on geographic area) as world population doubled. Modern agriculture's heavy reliance on petrochemicals and mechanization has raised concerns that oil shortages could <b>increase</b> <b>costs</b> and reduce agricultural output, causing food shortages.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the product}} {{development}} (i.e., architectural artifact) in each cell or the problem solution embodied by the cell {{is the answer}} to a question from a perspective, typically, the models or descriptions are higher-level depictions or the surface answers of the cell. The refined models or designs supporting that answer are the detailed descriptions within the cell. Decomposition (i.e., drill down to greater levels of detail) takes place within each cell. If a cell is not made explicit (defined), it is implicit (undefined). If it is implicit, the risk of making assumptions about these cells exists. If the assumptions are valid, then time and money are saved. If, however, the assumptions are invalid, it is likely to <b>increase</b> <b>costs</b> and exceed the schedule for implementation.|$|E
500|$|Opposition {{and efforts}} to repeal the {{legislation}} have drawn support from sources that include labor unions, conservative advocacy groups, Republicans, small business organizations and the Tea Party movement. These groups claimed that the law would disrupt existing health plans, <b>increase</b> <b>costs</b> from new insurance standards, and increase the deficit. Some opposed the idea of universal healthcare, viewing insurance as similar to other unsubsidized goods. President Donald Trump has repeatedly promised to [...] "repeal and replace" [...] it.|$|E
500|$|The Army {{issued a}} cure-notice to Lockheed on 10 April 1969, citing 11 {{technical}} problems, and unsatisfactory {{progress on the}} program. [...] The main issues were the half-P hop vibration issue, and the aircraft gross weight exceeding program requirements. In response, Lockheed proposed an [...] "improved flight control system" [...] (ICS) to reduce rotor oscillations, and steps for removing excess weight and addressing other minor issues in production helicopters. The Army felt Lockheed's solutions to the cure-notice issues would delay the program and <b>increase</b> <b>costs.</b> Citing Lockheed's inability to meet the production timeline, the Army canceled the AH-56 production contract on 19 May 1969, but retained the development contract in hopes that the issues could be resolved.|$|E

500|$|As {{this study}} was initiated, the route for the {{proposed}} freeway was located between 60th and 68th streets with a western end in Hudsonville and an eastern end in Lowell Township. The consultants were asked to study a full freeway and a limited access boulevard design. One final option was a [...] "no-build" [...] alternative; under this option, existing roads would be upgraded but no new roads would be built. The City of Grand Rapids opposed the freeway while the suburbs and townships south and west of the city supported it. City officials {{were concerned about the}} impact to commercial and industrial business in Grand Rapids. Hudsonville's city manager favored the proposal as a benefit to local vegetable producers who shipped produce to Detroit or Cleveland. Other supporters, such as the Georgetown Township supervisor, were concerned that delays in starting the project could <b>increase</b> <b>costs.</b> State and local officials expected the freeway in January 1981 to cost between $40–100million (equivalent to $– million in [...] ). The road was to be started no sooner than 1990.|$|E
500|$|The Jevons paradox {{indicates}} that increased efficiency by itself may not reduce fuel use, and that sustainable energy policy {{must rely on}} other types of government interventions. As the Jevons paradox applies only to technological improvements that increase fuel efficiency, the imposition of conservation standards or other government interventions that <b>increase</b> <b>costs</b> do not display the paradox {{and can be used}} to control the rebound effect. To ensure that efficiency-enhancing technological improvements reduce fuel use, efficiency gains can be paired with government intervention that reduces demand (e.g. green taxes, cap and trade, or higher emissions standards). The ecological economists Mathis Wackernagel and William Rees have suggested that any cost savings from efficiency gains be [...] "taxed away or otherwise removed from further economic circulation. Preferably they should be captured for reinvestment in natural capital rehabilitation." [...] By mitigating the economic effects of government interventions designed to promote ecologically sustainable activities, efficiency-improving technological progress may make the imposition of these interventions more palatable, and more likely to be implemented.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2012, the USDA {{published}} {{its fifth}} report {{in a series}} of periodic analyses to estimate the extent of trafficking in SNAP; that is, selling or otherwise converting SNAP benefits for cash payouts. Although trafficking does not directly <b>increase</b> <b>costs</b> to the Federal Government, it diverts benefits from their intended purpose of helping low-income families access a nutritious diet. [...] Also trafficking may indirectly <b>increase</b> <b>costs</b> by encouraging participants to stay in the program longer than intended, or by incentivizing new participants seeking to profit from trafficking. The FNS aggressively acts to control trafficking by using SNAP purchase data to identify suspicious transaction patterns, conducting undercover investigations, and collaborating with other investigative agencies.|$|E

Johnson (who had succeeded Frederick J. Kimball) tried a different tactic to block (or at least slow construction and <b>increase</b> <b>costs)</b> on the Tidewater Railway. He filed papers with the newly formed Virginia State Corporation Commission, which had replaced the Virginia Board of Public Works in 1903 and regulated Virginia's railroads, to attempt to force costly overpasses at proposed at-grade crossings with the N in Roanoke and South Norfolk citing [...] "great concern about the potential safety hazards" [...] which would allegedly result.|$|E
2500|$|The use of Bayesian {{decision}} theory in new product development {{allows for the}} use of subjective prior information. [...] Bayes in new product development allows for the comparison of additional review project costs with the value of additional information {{in order to reduce the}} costs of uncertainty. The methodology used for this analysis is in the form of decision trees and ‘stop’/‘go’ procedures. If the predicted payoff (the posterior) is acceptable for the organisation the project should go ahead, if not, development should stop. By reviewing the posterior (which then becomes the new prior) on regular intervals throughout the development stage managers are able to make the best possible decision with the information available at hand. Although the review process may delay further development and <b>increase</b> <b>costs,</b> it can help greatly to reduce uncertainty in high risk decisions.|$|E

2500|$|Gingrich {{supported}} the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, creating the Medicare Part D federal prescription drugs benefit program. While {{he has received}} some criticism from conservatives over {{the cost of the}} plan, Gingrich has reiterated his support in years since, saying that it represented necessary modernization of the system, as Medicare was created in the 1960s, before pharmaceutical drugs were in widespread use. He also stated that the costs of providing medication must be balanced against the decreased need for medical procedures. The same year, Gingrich founded the Center for Health Transformation to develop and advocate for [...] "transformational" [...] solutions that improve the quality of care, lower costs and expand coverage to all Americans. The Center has played a role in opposing PPACA, arguing that the plan will <b>increase</b> <b>costs</b> for both taxpayers and consumers and expand insurance coverage by growing government. The Center has released a series of charts highlighting different aspects of the legislation, focusing on the 159 new bureaucratic organizations it would create; the ten-year implementation timeline of nearly 500 related deadlines, mandates and taxes; and a claimed 1,968 new and expanded powers granted to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2011, a major {{disagreement}} over federal prevailing-wage law broke out regarding the project. [...] The dispute involved a petition filed in 2009 with the United States Department of Labor (DOL) by the Mid-Atlantic Regional Council of Carpenters, a regional union {{belonging to the}} United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America. The union claimed that because the city agreed to increase taxes to support CityCenterDC and a public park and city-subsidized affordable housing {{is included in the}} development, the project triggered the provisions of the federal Davis–Bacon Act—which requires that prevailing wages be paid on public works projects. The Wage and Hour Division rejected the petition in August 2010, but the union appealed and won a ruling in June 2011 applying prevailing wages to the project. The Wage and Hour Division ruling did not require the project to hire union workers, but would have the effect of making unionized contractors more competitive. The city and Hines/Archstone appealed to a DOL review board have the ruling overturned, arguing that it would <b>increase</b> <b>costs</b> by $20 million and compromise or bring to a halt major city-funded building projects at the Southwest Waterfront, the campus of St. Elizabeths Hospital, and the former Walter Reed Army Medical Center campus. The Wage and Hour Division said the city would be responsible for the wage increase, while the city said Hines/Archstone would need to pay for it. Local labor unions and the AFL-CIO opposed the city's decision to appeal (which had Mayor Gray's personal approval). The Washington Post editorialized strongly against DOL's June 2011 decision.|$|E
