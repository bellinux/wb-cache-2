40|$|Our {{knowledge}} and understanding of the P 2 receptor signalling system in the kidney have increased significantly in the last ten years. The broad range of physiological roles proposed for this receptor system and the variety of P 2 receptor subtypes found in the kidney suggest that any <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>function</b> may contribute to several pathological processes. So far, most reports of a possible pathophysiological role for this system in the kidney have focussed on polycystic kidney disease, where abnormal P 2 receptor signalling might be involved in cyst expansion and disease progression, and on the P 2 X 7 receptor, a unique P 2 X subtype, which when activated enhances inflammatory cytokine release and production, and also cell death. Expression of this particular receptor is upregulated in some forms of chronic renal injury and inflammatory diseases.

40|$|Obesity {{and climate}} change are two {{problems}} currently challenging humanity. Although apparently unrelated, an epidemiological approach to both shows a similar environmental aetiology, based in modern human lifestyles and their driving economic forces. One way of analysing this is through inflammation (defined as ‘... a <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>function</b> following insult or injury’) of both the internal (biological) and external (ecological) environments. Chronic, low-grade, systemic inflammation has recently been shown to accompany obesity, {{as well as a}} range of biological pathologies associated with obesity (diabetes, heart disease, some cancers, etc.). This is influenced by the body 2 ̆ 7 s inability to soak up excess glucose as a result of insulin resistance. In a broader sense, inflammation is a metaphor for ecological ‘pathologies’, manifest particularly in unnatural disturbances like climate change, ocean acidity, rising temperatures and species extinction, associated with the inability of the world 2 ̆ 7 s environmental ‘sinks’ to soak up carbon dioxide (‘carbon resistance’?). The use of such a metaphorical analysis opens the possibilities for dealing with two interdisciplinary problems simultaneously. Strategies for managing climate change, including personal carbon trading, could provide a ‘stealth intervention’ for reducing population levels of obesity by increasing personal energy expenditure and decreasing energy-dense food intake, as well as reducing the carbon emissions causing climate chang...|$|E

A number of abnormal movements may occur in patients with acute renal failure. These include muscle fasciculation, asterixis, and myoclonus (Locke et al., 1961; Tyler, 1968). There are, how-ever, relatively few detailed clinical descriptions of uraemic myoclonus. Our purpose in this short communication is to describe the clinical characteristics of myoclonus in two patients with acute renal failure, and to report the dramatic effect of clonazepam in suppressing the myoclonus. These observations appear relevant to other recent observations in patients with myoclonus of differ-ent aetiologies (Chadwick et al., 1977), and may further our understanding of the basic mechanisms of some forms of myoclonus.

40|$|From {{the late}} 1800 s until recently, {{the value and}} use of {{detoxification}} have been championed mainly by the naturopathic profession and those interested in natural health. However, {{with the emergence of}} increasingly sophisticated laboratory tests and the growing influence of natural medicine, detoxification is gaining recognition as a valid method of removing obstacles to healing and producing greater levels of health. Detoxification, of course, is the removal of toxins. The word toxin comes from the Greek tocikon, meaning a type of poison, and poison is defined as any substance that may cause damage to structure or <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>function</b> producing symptomatology, illness or death. 1 Health care practitioners tend to think of detoxification as limited to procedures such as colon cleansing or chelation of heavy metals. But toxicity occurs at every level of function and structure in the body from the psychological to the molecular. It may even be present at the energetic (structural vibration) level as evidenced by the value of homeopathic remedies such as lycopodium, nux vomica and sulphur in detoxification 2. Toxicity can arise from a variety of internal and external sources including phys-ical obstruction and an excess or deficiency of endogenous or exogenous sub-stances. Some of the most obvious sources are chemical, petrochemical, biochem-ical, thermals, and irradiation contamination. Physical obstructions include partial or complete mechanical blockages of function such as impacted fecal matter in the colon, thick mucus restricting absorption of nutrients in the small intestine, gallstones preventing bile flow in the bile duct, or tumors or cysts blocking lymph or blood vessels. Detoxification in such instances involves physical removal of the obstruc-tion by whatever means is most prudent...|$|E
40|$|Of the {{two factors}} {{involved}} in infectious disease-the host and the infecting agent-the latter {{has received the}} greater amount of laboratory study, both {{from the standpoint of}} those characteristic reactions which make recognition on isolation an easy task and its preparation for purposes of prophylaxis and therapy. It is only recently that attention has been turned to a study of the various factors, other than serologically demonstrable characteristics, which determine to some degree the ability of the host to resist infection or to overcome it once it becomes established, or which make one individual more susceptible than another to bacterial or virus invasion. Thus, {{it has been shown that}} such non-specific conditions as the nutritive state, climatic conditions, and physical constitution play more than a minor role in determining the resistance of man, not only to a specific type of infection but to parasitism by microbial agents in general. Although it has been postulated by many that the endocrine system must play an important part in determining the degree of susceptibility or resistance to infectious disease, this has been done largely on the basis of inference drawn from observations made in the clinic, where it has often been noticed that individuals suffering with <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>function</b> of one or another of the endocrine glands seem more prone to infection and do not overcome infectious processes with the same degree of ease as do those who have no apparent endocrine dysfunction. The experimental evidence in support of such an hypothesis is meager and contradictory. Search of the literature reveals many reports on the use of various hormone preparations in both natural and experimental infections, but no one disease has been thoroughly investigated from the endocrine standpoint, although a number ranging in severity from acne to tuberculosis, have been rather superficially studied.

40|$|Autosomal-dominant {{polycystic kidney}} disease (ADPKD) {{is the most common}} {{heritable}} kidney disorder with a prevalence of 1 in 400 to 1 in 1000 and accounting for ∼ 5 % of the patient population requiring maintenance dialysis [1, 2]. Polycystins are required for the mainten-ance of differentiated epithelium, are expressed in kidney, liver and pancreas tubular cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelium and play a role in multiple signalling pathways [3]. <b>Disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>function</b> results in increased tubular cell proliferation and apoptosis, fluid secretion resulting in progressive renal cyst formation and proliferation [1]. Mutations of the PKD 1 gene, encoding polycystin- 1, a membrane receptor, account for 85 % of cases. A further 15 % of cases are due to mutations of the PKD 2 gene, encoding polycystin- 2, a calcium-permeable channel binding polycystin- 1. In general, PKD 1 disease is associated with a more severe clinical phenotype than PKD 2, with earlier onset of end-stage kidney disease (mean age 54 years compared with 74 years) and greater numbers of renal cysts [1, 4, 5]. The mTOR pathway is regulated by polycystin and plays a role in multiple pathways, including the regulation of cell growth and proliferation. mTOR signalling is in-creased in murine models and human ADPKD, while mTOR inhibitors reverse disease progression in the former [6 – 8]. These findings together with the regression of hepatic disease seen in sirolimus-treated transplant reci-pients [9] have stimulated interest in mTOR inhibitors as a potential therapeutic agent for human ADPKD. The challenge for triallists is the slow progression of clinical disease. Unlike the murine models of polycystic disease, human disease is characterized by progression over decades [1, 2]. The development of reliable surro-gates for meaningful clinical outcomes has been a require-ment for clinical research. In this context, th...|$|E
40|$|JUDGING by {{textbooks}} muscular {{diseases are}} very uncommon, {{but this is}} hardly {{in harmony with the}} fact that the musculature-the active locomotor apparatus-is the largest organ of the body. According to Sir Colin Mackenzie (1930) the animal body contains not less than 434 muscles, which constitute about 45 per cent. of the total weight, and the musculature con-tains about one-third of the total blood (R. J. S. McDowall, 1938). Further, one has to bear in mind that the muscles are subject for the greater part of the day to wear and tear, and from a purely theoretical point of view the muscles may be expected to be very liable to disease. Muscular diseases are very frequent indeed, but their recognition has been delayed probably owing to the fact that they give rise to referred or heterotopic (D. Waterston) pain. This fundamental fact regarding muscle physiology has been studied very recently-experimentally (Sir Thomas Lewis and I. H. Kellgren, 1938) and clinically (Good, 1938). The commonest muscular disease is myalgia, and is present in and responsible for pain complained of by the vast majority of people suffering from what is generally called rheumatism, and in a number of other minor diseases. Myalgia is a disease, the cardinal symptom of which is pain associated with more or less <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>function.</b> Since the disturbance of function-e. g., locomotion-is solely due to pain, which is aggravated by contraction of the affected muscle or muscles, myalgia may be looked upon as the prototype of the disease of pain (La maladie de la douleur, R. Leriche, 1932). In. such conditions pain is the outstanding symptom, but it is a subjective phenomenon; local tenderness, too, is solely sub-jective. Experience has shown that there exist normosensitive, hypersensitive- and hyposensitive individuals or patients with regard to pain, indicating that the threshold of pain differs individually. In the case of myalgia the diagnosis can be based on objective phenomena. DErinmoN. -Myalgia is a muscular disease localised in well-definable parts of a muscle and in its appendages-tendon...|$|E
40|$|Left {{ventricular}} diastolic {{function was}} studied in 11 patients with coronary artery disease. Single plane ventriculography (30 degrees right anterior oblique projection) was performed at rest and during {{an episode of}} angina immediately {{after a period of}} rapid atrial pacing. Left ventricular pressure was recorded simultaneously by a micromanometer tipped catheter. The ventriculograms were digitised frame by frame to derive continuous plots of left ventricular shape, volume, and rate of change of volume. The time constant (tau) of the fall in left ventricular pressure was determined from the exponential portion of pressure decay during isovolumic relaxation. Ventricular pressure-volume loops were constructed to study the left ventricular diastolic pressure-volume relation. The time of minimum left ventricular pressure was used to divide diastole into an early phase and a late phase. Angina was associated with an increase in end systolic volume and a fall in ejection fraction with no significant change in end diastolic volume. Peak left ventricular pressure was unchanged but left ventricular minimum and end diastolic pressures were both increased and the diastolic pressure-volume relation was moved upwards. The time constant of left ventricular pressure fall was prolonged. At rest more than 50 % of the stroke volume entered the left ventricle during the period of early diastole. This proportion was significantly reduced during angina and as a consequence a significantly greater proportion of the stroke volume entered the ventricle during late diastole. Despite this, and although the left ventricular diastolic pressure-volume relation was moved upwards with angina, the mean slope of the relation during late diastole [...] that is, chamber stiffness [...] was not significantly altered. The upward shift of the left ventricular diastolic pressure-volume relation seen during angina is thus already apparent in early diastole, and its extent does not change during the later phase of diastole, which alone shows the property of passive stiffness. A primary increase in the passive stiffness of the ventricle cannot therefore be the cause of the upward shift of the diastolic pressure-volume relation, and events occurring in early diastole have to be looked to for an explanation. The study findings show that left ventricular function in early diastole is profoundly disturbed during angina pectoris and it is suggested that loss of elastic recoil and dissipation of this restoring force by asynchronous onset of relaxation and abnormal changes in shape are important factors contributing to this <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>function...</b>|$|E

The effect is air pollution, in which it would take along a <b>disturbance</b> on lung’s <b>function</b> <b>of,</b> especially, workers of the industry. The aim {{of this research is}} to find out risk factor of dust’s amount on air at working area to lung’s <b>function</b> <b>of</b> the workers inside, and also to measure the prevalence ratio of dust exposure’s effect to the <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> lung’s <b>function</b> on workers. <b>Disturbance</b> <b>of</b> lung’s <b>function,</b> on this research, is limited on lung function parameter, which are FVC, FEV 1 and FEV 1 /FVC ratio and all are classified as dichotomy. Methods: This research is classified as survey analitic research with cross sectional approach. The population is workers on industry at Demak Regency. Research is carried on by measuring lung’s function parameter using Spirometer. The samples are 45 peoples of 3 (three) rice mill industry. They are taken by Simple Random Sampling method of 85 existing workers. Results: The result shows that 34 of 45 respondents are working indoor with the amount of dust is bigger than Limiting Value. From the Statistical Test, we get that the incidence <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> lung’s <b>function</b> on workers is influenced by the amount of dust on air at working area (p value = 0, 002), and also strengthened by working duration (p value = 0, 000), smoking habit (p value = 0, 001), and the existence of history of lung disease (p value = 0, 001). The prevalence ratios of each independent variables to the incidence <b>of</b> <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> lung’s <b>function</b> are : the amoung of organic dust on air (PR = 3, 018, p value = 0. 039), and also strengthened by the existence of history of lung disease (PR = 3. 535, p value = 0. 021), working duration (PR = 4. 130, p value = 0. 024).

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe EORTC/RTOG {{late effects}} {{classification}} {{has been used}} for many years and covers nearly all organs and tissues, which may develop late radiation injuries. Dische developed a scoring system for radiation toxicity in which each clinical sign or symptom, that is characteristic for <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>function</b> in an irradiated organ, is given scores for severity individually. EORTC and RTOG formed working groups to up-date their systems, for the recording of late injury to normal tissues, to be used in future clinical trials. The resulting system is called LENT-SOMA (1993). AimIn preparation for the introduction of the LENT-SOMA scale into clinical practice at the Centre of Oncology-Institute in Gliwice, we followed a sizeable cohort of patients using two scoring systems for the assessment of delayed radiation toxicity at each follow-up examination which took place every 6 months for up to 5 years after curative radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. Materials/MethodsThe analysed material comprised of 113 patients with oral cavity, pharyngeal or supraglottic cancer (T 2 - 4 N 0 - 1) irradiated by conventional methods (18 patients), continuous accelerated irradiation (CAIR) (52 patients) or concomitant boost (CB) (43 patients). Total dose was in the range of 66 – 74 Gy. Delayed radiation toxicity was evaluated by two classification systems, those of Dische and LENT-SOMA, in the mucosal membranes, skin, larynx, salivary glands and spinal cord every 6 months after completion of radiotherapy treatment. The values in every scale were normalised (as a proportion of the maximum intensity for all symptoms) which permitted statistical comparison of the scales by use of the Wilcoxon test. ResultsAnalysis of all materials indicated a difference in the intensity of late radiation toxicity as estimated by the Dische and LENT-SOMA scales. The intensity of delayed radiation toxicity in the normalised Dische scale, for mucosal membranes and for skin, had higher values than observed in the LENT-SOMA system for the majority of examined patients. In the case of the larynx and salivary glands, the opposite situation was noted. The extent of conformity between normalised scales was evaluated {{in the case of the}} spinal cord. ConclusionsThe scoring systems of Dische and LENT-SOMA can not be interchangeably used, in clinical practice, for the estimation of delayed radiation toxicity in tissues of the head and neck region.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between male infertility and sperm immunity was studied on 237 patients of male infertility; 159 oligozoospermia, 33 functional azoospermia, 13 obstructive azoospermia and 32 men from unexplained infertile couples. Twelve vasectomized and 52 fathered men were also studied as controls. For detection of antibodies, their sera were tested by tube-slide agglutination test, sperm immobilization test, indirect immunofluorescent antibody technique, {{and in some}} cases gelatin agglutination test. Seminal plasma was tested by sperm immobilization test and agglutination tests in some cases. Kremer's in vitro sperm penetration test was done on cases with positive antisperm antibodies. The results are as follows: 1) The proportion of positive antisperm antibodies in serum showed significantly high value in the patients of obstructive azoospermia and post-vasectomy compared with normal controls. Indirect immunofluorescent antibody technique particularly showed high positive rate as in the obstructive azoospermia group being the highest as 92. 3 %. Accordingly, this method seemed to be helpful for diagnosis of obstructive azoospermia. On the other hand, in the cases of functional azoospermia the positiveness was particularly low. 2) There {{was no significant difference in}} the positive rate between the group with impaired function of sperm production and the group with normal sperm counts. In obstructive azoospermia, the function of sperm production remained normal on testicular biopsy despite antisperm antibodies in serum. There seemed to be a little possibility that antisperm autoimmunity caused impairment of sperm production. 3) Sperm autoagglutination correlated with the results of tube-slide agglutination test. But more definite correlation was shown with gelatin agglutination test according to the fact that all the 10 cases with sperm autoagglutination were positive and their antibody titers showed relatively good correlation with the degree of sperm autoagglutination. It was suggested that sperm autoagglutination was caused by sperm agglutination antibodies. 4) No correlation was seen between impaired sperm motility rate and sperm immobilizing antibody. There were found cases with normal sperm motility in spite of their high titered sperm immobilizing antibodies. 5) According to the data of Kremer's test with semen of men with antisperm antibodies, sperm agglutinating and immobilizing antibodies were confirmed to impair sperm penetration through the cervical mucus. Therefore these antibodies can be the cause of infertility. On the other hand, antibody which could be detected by indirect immunofluorescent antibody technique did not impair sperm penetration. 6) In summary, an 6 sperm antibodies may not cause the <b>disturbance</b> <b>of</b> <b>function</b> of sperm production, but can be a cause of infertility in some patients with them. It can be concluded that detection of antisperm antibodies is necessary for clarifying the cause of male infertility clinically even though the semen findings are normal...|$|E
