40|$|Polyvinyl alcohol - carbon {{nanotube}} (PVA-CNT) fibers had been embedded to glass fiber reinforced polymers (GFRP) for the structural health {{monitoring of the}} composite material. The addition of the conductive PVA-CNT fiber to the nonconductive GFRP material aimed to enhance its sensing ability {{by means of the}} electrical resistance measurement method. The test specimen’s response to mechanical load and the in situ PVA-CNT fiber’s electrical resistance measurements were correlated for sensing and damage monitoring purposes. The embedded PVA-CNT fiber worked as a sensor in GFRP coupons in tensile loadings. Sensing ability of the PVA-CNT fibers was also demonstrated on an <b>integral</b> <b>composite</b> <b>structure.</b> PVA-CNT fiber near the fracture area of the structure recorded very high values when essential damage occurred to the structure. A finite element model of the same structure was developed to predict axial strains at locations of the <b>integral</b> <b>composite</b> <b>structure</b> where the fibers were embedded. The predicted FEA strains were correlated with the experimental measurements from the PVA-CNT fibers. Calculated and experimental values were in good agreement, thus enabling PVA-CNT fibers to be used as strain sensors...|$|E

This has been done by determining the buckling and post-buckling behavior of hat-stiffened composite panels under compression loading. A shadow Moire ́ technique was used to monitor the out-of-plane displacement of the skin panel. The experimental results of hat-stiffened panels for initial buckling and post-buckled response of the panels were compared with numerical results obtained from linear and non-linear finite element methods.

40|$|Abstract. Damping {{capacity}} and stiffness loss {{must be considered}} together {{in the design of}} <b>integral</b> damping <b>composite</b> <b>structures.</b> In the present paper, a discrete layer beam finite element is used to model and analyze a damped composite I-beam embedded with viscoelastic layers. Two multi-objective optimization models are developed with maximum natural frequency and modal loss factor. In the first model, only one damping layer is embedded in each flange of the I-beam. Design variables consist of damping layer thickness and its inserting location. In the second model, multiple damping layers of equal thickness are embedded in the flanges. Design variables included the number of damping layers and their inserting locations. Multi-objective genetic algorithm is used to solve optimization problems. It is showed that the analysis method has acceptable accuracy for composite damped I-beams, and it is convenient for optimization design of <b>integral</b> damping <b>composite</b> <b>structures,</b> especially for the cases embedded with multiple damping layers...|$|R
40|$|Simple two {{dimensional}} analysis techniques were developed {{to aid in the}} design of strong joints for integrally stiffened/bonded <b>composite</b> <b>structures</b> subjected to out of plane loads. It was found that most out of plane failures were due to induced stresses arising from rapid changes in load path direction or geometry, induced stresses due to changes in geometry caused by buckling, or direct stresses produced by fuel pressure or bearing loads. While the analysis techniques were developed to address a great variety of out of plane loading conditions, they were primarily derived to address the conditions described above. The methods were developed and verified using existing element test data. The methods were demonstrated using the data from a test failure of a high strain wingbox that was designed, built, and tested under a previous program. Subsequently, a set of design guidelines were assembled to assist in the design of safe, strong <b>integral</b> <b>composite</b> <b>structures</b> using the analysis techniques developed...|$|R
40|$|Damped {{composite}} laminates were fabricated by co-curing viscoelastic damping {{film with}} graphite/epoxy prepreg plies. The dynamic {{response of the}} damped plates was measured using an impulse response technique and compared with the response of similar undamped laminates.

The layers significantly increased the damping in the composite laminates. The use of the constrained viscoelastic film as an <b>integral</b> part of <b>composite</b> <b>structures</b> {{appears to be a}} feasible approach to passive vibration control.

Mono-spacer fabric composite made by 3 -D spacer fabric has super-high specific strength and specific stiffness. However, its mechanical properties cannot meet the demand of structural applications. In this article, facesheet-reinforced 3 -D spacer fabric composites were investigated by laminating additional glass weave at the skin sheets. Mechanical behavior of this facesheet-reinforced 3 -D spacer fabric composite was studied experimentally. Effects of various factors on the mechanical properties were also discussed, such as the additional layer number, the type of glass weave, and the lay-up type. Furthermore, an innovative <b>integral</b> multi-facesheet <b>structure</b> <b>composite</b> was developed by directly weaving three uniformly spaced facesheets in one construction.
