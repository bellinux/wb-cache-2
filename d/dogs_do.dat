5|$|Following the {{publication}} of the experiment in American Medicine, physician Augustus P. Clarke criticized the experiment's validity. Clarke noted {{that at the time of}} death there is a sudden rise in body temperature as the lungs are no longer cooling blood, causing a subsequent rise in sweating which could easily account for MacDougall’s missing 21 grams. Clarke also pointed out that, as <b>dogs</b> <b>do</b> not have sweat glands, they would not lose weight in this manner after death. Clarke's criticism was published in the May issue of American Medicine. Arguments between MacDougall and Clarke debating the validity of the experiment continued to be published in the journal until at least December that year.|$|E
5|$|Other vocalisations {{of wolves}} are usually {{divided into three}} categories: growls, barks and whines. Barking has a {{fundamental}} frequency between 320–904Hz, and is usually emitted by startled wolves. Wolves do not bark as loudly or continuously as <b>dogs</b> <b>do,</b> but bark {{a few times and}} retreat from perceived danger. Growling has a fundamental frequency of 380–450Hz, and is usually emitted during food challenges. Pups commonly growl when playing. One variation of the howl is accompanied by a high pitched whine, which precedes a lunging attack. Whining is associated with situations of anxiety, curiosity, inquiry and intimacy such as greeting, feeding pups and playing.|$|E

25|$|Dogs {{have shown}} {{an ability to}} {{understand}} human communication.

25|$|Up to 90% of the black-footed ferret's diet is {{composed}} of prairie dogs. The diet of the black-footed ferret varies depending on geographic location. In western Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, and Montana, black-footed ferrets historically associated with white-tailed prairie dogs and were forced to find alternate prey when white-tailed prairie dogs entered their four-month hibernation cycle. In Wyoming, alternate prey items consumed during white-tailed prairie dog hibernation included voles (Microtus spp.) and mice (Peromyscus spp. and Mus spp.) found near streams. In South Dakota, black-footed ferrets associate with black-tailed prairie dogs. Because black-tailed prairie <b>dogs</b> <b>do</b> not hibernate, little seasonal change in black-footed ferret diet is necessary.|$|E
25|$|Fleas and ticks {{of various}} species can be {{acquired}} and brought home by a dog, {{where they can}} multiply and attack humans (and vice versa). These two parasites are particularly important to note, now that tick-borne Lyme Disease has become endemic throughout a large area, {{in addition to other}} similar diseases such as Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. Although <b>dogs</b> <b>do</b> not seem to be as susceptible to such diseases as humans, similar rickettsial diseases have been spread by dogs to humans through such mechanisms as a dog killing an infected rabbit, then shaking itself off in the house near enough to its owners to fatally infect most of the family.|$|E
25|$|Dogs might exhibit {{signs of}} {{stiffness}} or soreness after rising from rest, reluctance to exercise, bunny-hopping or other abnormal gait (legs move more together when running rather than swinging alternately), lameness, pain, reluctance {{to stand on}} rear legs, jump up, or climb stairs, subluxation or dislocation of the hip joint, or wasting away of the muscle mass in the hip area. Radiographs (X-rays) often confirm the presence of hip dysplasia, but radiographic features may not be present until two years of age in some dogs. Moreover, many affected <b>dogs</b> <b>do</b> not show clinical signs, but some dogs manifest the problem before seven months of age, while others do not show it until well into adulthood.|$|E

25|$|The main {{methods used}} for {{humanitarian}} demining on land are: manual detection using metal detectors and prodders, detection by specially trained mine detection dogs, and mechanical clearance using armored vehicles fitted with flails, tiller or similar devices. There is an organization, APOPO, that is training African rats to detect landmines much as <b>dogs</b> <b>do,</b> offering a local solution to countries in Africa. In many circumstances, the only method {{that meets the}} United Nations' requirements for effective humanitarian demining, the International Mine Action Standards (IMAS), is manual detection and disarmament. The process is typically slow, expensive and dangerous, although demining can be safer than construction work if procedures are followed rigorously. New technologies may provide effective alternatives.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1984, all {{dogs are}} {{examined}} by veterinarians/nurses {{before the start}} of the race, who check teeth, eyes, tonsils, heart, lungs, joints, and genitals; they look for signs of illegal drugs, improperly healed wounds, and pregnancy. All dogs are identified and tracked by microchip implants and collar tags. On the trails, volunteer veterinarians examine each dog's heart, hydration, appetite, attitude, weight, lungs, and joints at all of the checkpoints, and look for signs of foot and shoulder injuries, respiration problems, dehydration, diarrhea, and exhaustion. When mushers race through checkpoints, the <b>dogs</b> <b>do</b> not get physical exams. Mushers are not allowed to administer drugs that mask the signs of injury, including stimulants, muscle relaxants, sedatives, anti-inflammatories, and anabolic steroids. , the Iditarod claims that no musher has been banned for giving drugs to dogs.|$|E
25|$|Other enthusiasts {{oppose the}} use of Border Collies as show dogs, for fear that {{breeding}} for appearance {{will lead to a}} decline in the breed's working dog traits. Few handlers of working Border Collies participate in conformation shows, as working dogs are bred to a performance standard rather than appearance standard. Likewise, conformation-bred dogs are seldom seen on the sheepdog trial field, except in Kennel Club-sponsored events. Dogs registered with either working or conformation based registries are seen in other performance events such as agility, obedience, tracking or flyball; however, these <b>dogs</b> <b>do</b> not necessarily conform to the breed standard of appearance as closely as the dogs shown in the breed rings as this is not a requirement in performance events, nor do they necessarily participate in herding activities.|$|E

25|$|For black-tailed prairie dogs, the {{resident}} male {{of the family}} group fathers all the offspring. Multiple paternity in litters {{seems to be more}} common in Utah and Gunnison’s prairie dogs. Mother prairie <b>dogs</b> <b>do</b> most of the care for the young. In addition to nursing the young, the mother also defends the nursery chamber and collects grass for the nest. Males play their part by defending the territories and maintaining the burrows. The young spend their first six weeks below the ground being nursed. They are then weaned and begin to surface from the burrow. By five months, they are fully grown. The subject of cooperative breeding in prairie dogs has been debated among biologists. Some argue prairie dogs will defend and feed young that are not theirs, and it seems young will sleep in a nursery chamber with other mothers; since most nursing occurs at night, this may be a case of communal nursing. In the case of the latter, others suggest communal nursing occurs only when mothers mistake another female's young for their own.|$|E
25|$|The {{frequency}} of barking in dogs {{in relation to}} wolves could also be {{the product of the}} very different social environment of dogs. Dogs live in extraordinarily close range with humans, in many societies kept solely as companion animals. From a very young age, humans tend to be one of a dog’s primary social contacts. This captive environment presents very different stimuli than would be found by wolves in the wild. While wolves have vast territories, <b>dogs</b> <b>do</b> not. The boundaries of a captive dog’s territory will be visited frequently by intruders, thus triggering the bark response as a warning. Additionally, dogs densely populate urban areas, allowing more opportunity to meet new dogs and be social. For example, it is possible that kenneled dogs may have increased barking due to a desire to facilitate social behavior. Dogs’ close relationship with humans also renders dogs reliant on humans, even for basic needs. Barking is a way to attract attention, and the behavior is continued by the positive response exhibited by the owners (e.g., if a dog barks to get food and the owner feeds it, the dog is being conditioned to continue said behavior).|$|E
