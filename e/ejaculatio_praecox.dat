5000|$|Premature {{ejaculation}} (PE) {{occurs when}} a man experiences orgasm and expels semen soon after sexual activity and with minimal penile stimulation. It has also been called early ejaculation, rapid ejaculation, rapid climax, premature climax, and (historically) <b>ejaculatio</b> <b>praecox.</b> There is no uniform cut-off defining [...] "premature", but a consensus of experts at the International Society for Sexual Medicine endorsed a definition including [...] "ejaculation which always or nearly always occurs prior to or within about one minute". The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) applies a cut-off of 15 seconds {{from the beginning of}} sexual intercourse. [...] Hong argued that rapid ejaculation is an evolutionary adaptation.|$|E
5000|$|The idyll of {{the railway}} station is {{periodically}} {{disturbed by the}} arrival of the councillor, Zednicek, a Nazi collaborator, who spouts propaganda at the staff without success. At her initiative, Máša spends the night with Miloš, but in his youthful excitability he ejaculates prematurely before achieving penetration and then is unable to perform sexually; and the next day, despairing, he attempts suicide. He is saved, and a young doctor explains to him that <b>ejaculatio</b> <b>praecox</b> is normal at Miloš's age. The doctor recommends Miloš to [...] "think of something else" [...] (at which point Miloš volunteers an interest in football), and to seek the assistance of an experienced woman. During the nightshift, Hubička flirts with the young telegraphist, Zdenička, and imprints her thighs and buttocks with the office's rubber stamps. Her mother sees the stamps and complains to Hubička's superiors, and the ensuing scandal helps to frustrate the stationmaster's ambition of being promoted to inspector.|$|E
40|$|The {{selective}} D- 2 antagonist eticlopride, at a dose (0. 01 mg/kg, s. c.) {{that fails}} to modify the normal behavior of rats, significantly reversed all the behavioral effects exerted by the selective D- 2 agonist SND 919 (0. 1 mg/kg, i. p.), namely, the stimulation of stretching-yawning, penile erection and sedation and the inhibition of grooming. In the copulatory test, eticlopride at the same dose did not affect animal sexual behavior but potently counteracted the reduction in mount and intromission frequency and latency to ejaculation induced by SND 919 at 0. 1 mg/kg, a behavioral pattern which might possibly be proposed as an animal model for human <b>ejaculatio</b> <b>praecox...</b>|$|E
