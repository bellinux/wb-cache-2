Wentz said of the endeavor [...] "To me, this is not a marketing campaign.

2500|$|Visually, the {{presentation}} of the show was very simple, and it did not feature the animation or fast pace of other children's shows, which Rogers thought of as [...] "bombardment". Rogers also believed in not acting out a different persona on camera compared to how he acted off camera, stating that [...] "One of the greatest gifts you can give anybody is the gift of your honest self. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>believe</b> that kids can spot a phony a mile away." [...] Rogers composed almost all of the music on the program. He wanted to teach children to love themselves and others, and he addressed common childhood fears with comforting songs and skits. For example, one of his famous songs explains how a child cannot be pulled down the bathtub drain because he or she will not fit. He even once took a trip to the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh to show children that a hospital is not a place to fear. During the Gulf War (1990–91), he assured his audience that all children in the neighborhood would be well cared for and asked parents to promise {{to take care of their}} own children. The message was aired again by PBS during the media storm that preceded the 2003 invasion of Iraq.|$|E

2500|$|Reverend Eugene Thomas from Ohio, USA, told James Powell and Roy P. Mackal in 1979 a {{story that}} {{involved}} the purported killing of a Mokèlé-mbèmbé near Lake Tele in 1959. Thomas was a missionary who {{had served in the}} Congo since 1955, gathering much of the earliest evidence and reports, and claiming to have had two close-encounters himself. Natives of the Bangombe tribe who lived near Lake Tele were said to have constructed a large spiked fence in a tributary of Tele to keep Mokèlé-mbèmbé from interfering with their fishing. A Mokele-mbembe managed to break through, though it was wounded on the spikes, and the natives then killed the creature. As William Gibbons writes, [...] "Pastor Thomas also mentioned that the two pygmies mimicked the cry of the animal as it was being attacked and speared... Later, a victory feast was held, during which parts of the animal were cooked and eaten. However, those who participated in the feast eventually died, either from food poisoning or from natural causes. <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>believe</b> that the mythification (magical powers, etc) surrounding Mokèlé-mbèmbés [...] began with this incident." [...] Furthermore, Mackal heard from witnesses that the stakes were in the same location in the tributary as of the early 1980s.|$|E

And have we now forgotten that powerful friend? or do we imagine that we no longer need His assistance. I have lived, Sir, a long time and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs I see of this truth—that God governs in the affairs of men.

This unnamed victim claimed that he identified the suspects in his attack, and that two other men were identified and arrested. The suspects were supposedly released an hour later due to pressure from their families, and two of the investigators were fired. Sayenko stated in court that four days before the three suspects were arrested, police caught two men and a woman committing one of the murders. The suspects attacked the police officers but were arrested and were booked under the names of Sayenko and Suprunyuk, but they were not the men currently on trial. [...] "But now these details are being covered up", Sayenko said in court. [...] "The investigators claim that this did not happen.

Mordeckai was just finishing up his Ph. D. thesis Carbon and oxygen isotopic composition of carbonate rocks from Israel at the Weizmann Institute of Science under the direction of Joel Gat. Little did I realize at the time that Mordeckai had in fact analyzed virtually every type of limestone and dolomite in Israel, including a variety of non-sedimentary occurrences, and that he had basically delineated all of the isotopic variations in these kinds of rocks throughout the entire country. Thus, his Ph. D. thesis became a hallmark of the Magaritz approach to science, namely, picking an important problem and attacking it with careful sampling and data collection on a massive scale. Also, because of this, he and I later got along quite well together, inasmuch as <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>believed</b> that the really lasting contributions in geochemistry are not necessarily the scientific interpretations (which can come and go), but the discovery of new phenomena, backed up by accurate analyses of carefully collected and documented samples, from areas with relatively straightforward geological relationships and good outcrops...|$|R
