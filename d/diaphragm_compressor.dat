40|$|A very long-life, {{lightweight}} and efficient hydride absorption refrigerator system {{was built to}} operate at ten Kelvin and below. The system consists of four basic stages of refrigeration. The first stage is accomplished by an active refrigeration system. The second stage is operated by a hydride absorption system, wherein a heated hydride powder drives off high pressure hydrogen through a Joule-Thomson/heat exchanger expansion loop such that the hydrogen is partially liquefied. In the third stage, the vapor pressure over the collected liquid hydrogen is lowered by absorbing the hydrogen vapor onto a different low pressure, worn hydride. With a 1. 7 torr partial pressure of hydrogen gas in the hydride, liquid hydrogen is solidified and sublimes at 10 K.

40|$|In 2010 a {{joint project}} between Volvo Technology Corporation (VTEC), Göteborg Energi AB and Chalmers University of Technology (Chalmers) was started. The project aims to {{investigate}} whether substitute natural gas or a less refined gas is usable in heavy vehicle engines. The main criteria will be the overall efficiency, from well to wheel, while fulfilling the regulations regarding emissions in both EU (Euro 6 emission regulations) and the US. The project {{is a result of}} the political will to exchange fossil fuel in the transport sector to renewable alternatives. 	One part of the project is that Chalmers shall provide VTEC with gas from Chalmers’ biomass gasifier that is tar, water and particle free. To be able to provide this gas there is a need for an installation that extract and clean around 3 [mN 3 /h] (50 [dmN 3 /min]). Furthermore, the gas needs to be compressed and stored in tanks before it can be delivered. 	This work focuses on the design of this cleaning and storage installation and includes a preliminary hazard analysis (PreHA). The system that results from this work include a particle filter, a venturi scrubber and a packed column for tar and water removal followed by two <b>diaphragm</b> <b>compressors</b> to pressurise the clean product gas. The solvent proposed for the scrubbers is diesel which may be exchanged when the concentration of accumulated tar gets too high. 	The dimensioning of tar and water removal is based on HYSYS simulation. The simulation shows that a large fraction of the heavier tars is removed already in the venturi scrubber, while the lighter tars like benzene are removed in the packed column. The simulation shows no indications on tar condensing in the compressors, up to 200 [bar], predicting a sufficient level of tar removal for the proposed system. 	For the packed column the calculated height is between 10 and 20 [m] depending on which level to remove the tar. This is very high and probably is due to that only gas absorption is considered, which can be seen as a worst case scenario as in the real case also condensation of the tars takes place. An estimate is that the height in reality will be lower than 10 [m]. 	Regarding the PreHA, the analysis has illustrated the need for gas detection systems both within the systems and for the surrounding, this to minimise the risk of explosive mixtures and toxic environments. Furthermore the need of training and knowledge of the operator will be essential to run the installation in a safe way...|$|R

The compression of the captured carbon dioxide stream requires significant amounts of power, which impacts plant availability and operational costs. Preliminary analysis has estimated that the CO 2 compression process reduces typical power plant efficiency by 8 % to 12 %. The work presented in this paper supports the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) objectives of reducing the energy requirements for carbon capture and storage in electrical power production. The primary objective of this study is to boost the pressure of CO 2 to pipeline pressures with the minimum amount of energy required. Previous thermodynamic analysis identified optimum processes for pressure rise in both liquid and gaseous states. Isothermal compression is well known to reduce the power requirements by minimizing the temperature of the gas entering subsequent stages. Intercooling is typically accomplished using external gas coolers and integrally geared compressors. For large scale compression, use of straight through centrifugal compressors, similar to those used in oil and gas applications including LNG production, is preferred due to the robustness of the design. However, external intercooling between each stage is not feasible.

The compression of the captured CO 2 stream requires significant power, which impacts plant availability, capital expenditures, and operational cost. Preliminary analysis has estimated that the CO 2 compression process alone reduces the plant efficiency by 8 - 12 percent for a typical power plant. The goal of the present research is to reduce this penalty through development of novel compression and pumping processes. The research supports the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) objectives of reducing the energy requirements for carbon capture and sequestration in electrical power production. However, the technology presented here is applicable to other gases including hydrocarbons as well as smaller scale carbon capture projects including CO 2 separation from natural gas. The primary objective of this study is to boost the pressure of CO 2 from near atmospheric to pipeline pressures with the minimal amount of energy required. Previous thermodynamic analysis identified optimum processes for pressure rise in both liquid and gaseous states. Isothermal compression is well known to reduce the power requirements by minimizing the temperature of the gas entering downstream stages. Intercooling is typically accomplished using external gas coolers and integrally geared compressors. Integrally geared compressors do not offer the same robustness and reliability as in-line centrifugal compressors.

A range of operating conditions was tested to evaluate the effect on heat transfer. At elevated pressures, CO 2 assumes a liquid state at moderate temperatures.

40|$|The Electrochemical Hydrogen Compressor EHC was {{evaluated}} against DOE applications for compressing hydrogen at automobile filling stations, in future hydrogen pipelines {{and as a}} commercial replacement for conventional <b>diaphragm</b> hydrogen <b>compressors.</b> It was also evaluated as a modular replacement for the compressors used in petrochemical refineries. If the EHC can be made inexpensive, reliable and long lived then it can satisfy all these applications save pipelines where the requirements for platinum catalyst exceeds the annual world production. The research performed did not completely investigate Molybdenum as a hydrogen anode or cathode, it did show that photoetched 316 stainless steel is inadequate for an EHC. It also showed that: molybdenum bipolar plates, photochemical etching processes, and Gortex Teflon seals are too costly for a commercial EHC. The use of carbon paper in combination with a perforated thin metal electrode demonstrated adequate anode support strength, but is suspect in promoting galvanic corrosion. The nature of the corrosion mechanisms are not well understood, but locally high potentials within the unit cell package are probably involved. The program produced a design with an extraordinary high cell pitch, and a very low part count. This {{is one of the}} promising aspects of the redesigned EHC. The development and successful demonstration of the hydraulic cathode is also important. The problem of corrosion resistant metal bipolar plates is vital to the development of an inexpensive, commercial PEM fuel cell. Our research suggests that there is more to the corrosion process in fuel cells and electrochemical compressors than simple, steady state, galvanic stability. It is an important area for scientific investigation. The experiments and analysis conducted lead to several recommended future research directions. First, we need {{a better understanding of the}} corrosion mechanisms involved. The diagnosis of experimental cells with titration to determine the loss of membrane active sites is recommended. We suspect that the corrosion includes more than simple galvanic mechanisms. The mechanisms involved in this phenomenon are poorly understood. Shunt currents at hydraulic cathode ports were problematic, but are not difficult to cure. In addition to corrosion there is evidence of high component resistivity. This may be due to the deposition of organic compounds, which may be produced electrochemically on the surface of the metal support screens that contact carbon gas diffusion layers (GDLs) or catalyst supports. An investigation of possible electro-organic sythesis mechanisms with emphasis on oxalates formation is warranted. The contaminated cell parts can be placed in an oxidizing atmosphere at high temperature and the weight loss can be observed. This would reveal the existence of organic compounds. Investigation into the effects of conductivity enhancers such as carbon microlayers on supporting carbon paper is also needed. Corrosion solutions should be investigated such as surface passivation of 316 SS parts using nitric acid. Ultra thin silane/siloxane polymer coatings should be tried. These may be especially useful in conjunction with metal felt replacement of carbon paper. A simple cure for the very high, localized corrosion of the anode might be to diffusion bond the metal electrode support screen to bipolar plate. This will insure uniform resistance perpendicular to the plane of the cell and eliminate some of the dependence of the resistance on high stack compression. Alternative materials should be explored. Alternatives to carbon in the cell may be helpful in any context. In particular, alternatives to carbon paper GDLs such as metal felts and alternatives to carbon supports for Pt such as TiC and TiB 2 might also be worthwhile and would be helpful to fuel cells as well. Some alternative to the metals we used in the cell, Mo and 316 SS, are potentially useful. These include Al/Mg/Si alloys. Corrosion resistant materials such as Nb and Mo might prove useful as cladding materials that can be hot stamped. Several cost reduction areas should be explored. Such as the water pumps used in pressure washers. The power consumption of these pumps is a concern, but their cost is surprisingly low. Two components of unit cell construction proved to be extremely costly. The first of these is photoetching, where selective etching of alloys present a corrodible composition in the cell. An alternative to photoetching may be hot stamping. An investigation of materials for hot stamping and the dimension tolerance attainable with this process should be first on the agenda. Hot stamping of clad materials should also be studied. Photoetched electrode supports can be replaced with expanded metal screens (Dexmet). The other high cost area is the use of Gortex TFE seals. Analytic’s prior experience with Acrylic seals shows they can probably replace TFE...|$|R

40|$|Although {{constant}} positive airway pressure {{therapy is}} currently the most effective form of non-invasive treatment to relieve obstructive sleep apnea symptoms, it has relatively low treatment compliance due to pressure related side effects. Existing commercial continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices rely on the combined airflow characteristics of both the air delivery unit and nasal mask vent to regulate treatment pressure. Fluctuation in mask pressure occurs however, due to patient breathing, presenting an opportunity to develop an alternative breathing therapy device capable of achieving dynamic control of mask pressure. Within this research, a computer model of a proposed patient breathing therapy device, based on characteristics of a prototype system, is developed to determine the breathing system air delivery requirements whilst operating under a simulated patient breathing load. This model initially utilises an idealised, zero order, air delivery unit behaviour, since this system element {{is yet to be}} built. A review of different types of air compressors is undertaken and the diaphragm type compressor selected as being best suited for practical implementation within the air delivery unit of the breathing system, based on constraints of air quality, available machining resource and materials.
