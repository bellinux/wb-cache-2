5|$|The race saw the {{introduction}} of a new qualifying system. As before, qualifying was divided into three parts. However, instead of eliminating the slowest drivers {{at the end of each}} respective session, the slowest driver at a given point was now eliminated from contention every ninety seconds, with the countdown starting some minutes <b>into</b> <b>every</b> session.|$|E
5|$|Albert Speer {{said that}} though Himmler seemed pedantic and {{insignificant}} on the surface, {{he was a}} good decision maker, had a talent for selecting highly competent staff, and successfully inserted the SS <b>into</b> <b>every</b> aspect of daily life. Historian Peter Longerich observes that Himmler's ability to consolidate his ever-increasing powers and responsibilities into a coherent system {{under the auspices of the}} SS led him to become one of the most powerful men in the Third Reich.|$|E
5|$|Education: The PIN of a Lebanese Identity Card holder's {{child is}} {{captured}} during enrollment into primary {{school and the}} number is used for admission <b>into</b> <b>every</b> school level until the child completes tertiary education. This helps in tracking the progress of a Lebanese Identity Card holder's child in the educational sector for necessary policy interventions. Students who qualify for studentâ€™s loan are {{able to use the}} Lebanese Identity Card to establish their identities to eliminate fraud. Data from the NIA database enables the Ministry of Education to plan effectively for the provision of targeted educational infrastructure and other resources for their community.|$|E

5|$|A recent {{development}} {{is the use of}} the RDS system of car radios. The ambulance is fitted with a short range FM transmitter, set to RDS code 31, which interrupts the radio of all cars within range, {{in the manner of a}} traffic broadcast, but in such a way that the user of the receiving radio is unable to opt out of the message (as with traffic broadcasts). This feature is built <b>into</b> <b>every</b> RDS radio for use in national emergency broadcast systems, but short range units on emergency vehicles can prove an effective means of alerting traffic to their presence. It is, however, unlikely that this system could replace audible warnings, as it is unable to alert pedestrians, those not using a compatible radio or even have it turned off.|$|E
5|$|Many {{details of}} Monitors history and {{insights}} of everyday crew life {{have been discovered}} from correspondence sent from the various crew members {{to family and friends}} while serving aboard the ironclad. In particular the correspondence of George S. Geer, who sent more than 80 letters, often referred to as The Monitor Chronicles, to his wife Martha during the entire time of Monitors service provide many details and insights <b>into</b> <b>every</b> chapter of the ironclad's short-lived history, offering a rare perspective of a sailor's experience on the naval front during the Civil War. The letters of Acting Paymaster William F. Keeler to his wife Anna also corroborate many of the accounts of affairs that took place aboard the Monitor. The letters of Geer and Keeler are available for viewing and are housed at the Mariners' Museum in Virginia. Other crew members were interviewed later in life, like Louis Stodder, one of the last crew members to abandon Monitor minutes before she sank in a storm at sea, who was the last surviving crew member of Monitor and lived well into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all artillery, {{including}} howitzers, guns, anti-aircraft and rockets, were {{tasked with}} anti-tank defence. Dug-in tanks and self-propelled guns further strengthened the anti-tank defences. Anti-tank forces were incorporated <b>into</b> <b>every</b> level of command, mostly as anti-tank strong points {{with the majority}} concentrated on likely attack routes and the remainder amply spread out elsewhere. Each anti-tank strong-point typically consisted of four to six anti-tank guns, six to nine anti-tank rifles, and five to seven heavy and light machine guns. They were supported by mobile obstacle detachments {{as well as by}} infantry with automatic firearms. Independent tank and self-propelled gun brigades and regiments were tasked with cooperating with the infantry during counterattacks.|$|E

5|$|Peking opera follows other {{traditional}} Chinese arts in emphasizing meaning, rather than accuracy. The highest aim of performers {{is to put}} beauty <b>into</b> <b>every</b> motion. Indeed, performers are strictly criticized for lacking beauty during training. Additionally, performers are taught to create a synthesis between the different aspects of Peking opera. The four skills of Peking opera are not separate, but rather should be combined in a single performance. One skill may take precedence at certain moments during a play, {{but this does not}} mean that other actions should cease. Much attention is paid to tradition in the art form, and gestures, settings, music, and character types are determined by long held convention. This includes conventions of movement, which are used to signal particular actions to the audience. For example, walking in a large circle always symbolizes traveling a long distance, and a character straightening his or her costume and headdress symbolizes that an important character is about to speak. Some conventions, such as the pantomimic opening and closing of doors and mounting and descending of stairs, are more readily apparent.|$|E
5|$|The path {{originated}} as a {{route for}} the Coastguard to walk from lighthouse to lighthouse patrolling for smugglers. They {{needed to be}} able to look down <b>into</b> <b>every</b> bay and cove: as a result, the path closely hugs the coast providing excellent views but rarely the most direct path between two points. The South West Coast Path is no longer used by the Coastguard but it has been transformed from a practical defence system into a resource for recreational walkers. The path is covered by England's right-of-way laws, as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which keep historic footpaths open to the public even when they pass through private property. Sections of the path are maintained by the National Trust, which owns parts of the coast.|$|E
5|$|Many critics saw A Link Between Worlds as {{a worthy}} {{successor}} to A Link to the Past, but also remarked {{that the game}} was outstanding in its own right. The game was commended for making enhancements to core and traditional elements of the series. New additions and changes to the established formula were also welcomed. Polygon reviewer Arthur Gies called it the best Zelda game in past twenty years, and GamesRadar writer Lorenzo Veloria {{said that it was}} an essential title for every Nintendo 3DS owner. Reception towards the game's puzzles was overwhelmingly positive; praise was directed towards how well the wall-merging mechanic had been incorporated into dungeon puzzles and integrated <b>into</b> <b>every</b> area of the game. Keza MacDonald of IGN thought A Link Between Worlds was the best puzzle game that Nintendo had ever created. Game Informer writer Dan Ryckert noted that some of the game's dungeons and boss encounters were {{among the best in the}} franchise's history. The level of difficulty present in the puzzles and dungeons was met with approval; the challenge was described as a perplexing experience rather than a frustrating one by GameSpot editor Martin Gaston.|$|E
