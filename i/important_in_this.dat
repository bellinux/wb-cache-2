5|$|Enzyme {{kinetics}} cannot prove which {{modes of}} catalysis {{are used by}} an enzyme. However, some kinetic data can suggest possibilities to be examined by other techniques. For example, a ping–pong mechanism with burst-phase pre-steady-state kinetics would suggest covalent catalysis might be <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> enzyme's mechanism. Alternatively, the observation of a strong pH effect on Vmax but not Km might indicate that a residue in the active site {{needs to be in}} a particular ionisation state for catalysis to occur.|$|E
5|$|The Baroque art was {{developing}} {{to a great}} extent under the patronage of the Catholic Church, which utilized the art to facilitate religious influence, allocating for this purpose the very substantial financial resources at its disposal. The most <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> context art form was architecture, with features rather austere at first, accompanied in due time by progressively more elaborate and lavish facade and interior design concepts.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{dispersion}} is <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> species, {{despite its}} restricted distribution. Queens never forage outside {{or leave the}} nest, unless under severe deprivation. Before nuptial flight, fully developed females start to occur during summer. Between 9 and 10 pm in January, queens and males start to emerge from their host nest and begin to mate. Observations show that the alates will climb up onto objects such as lighted fluorescent lamps and begin to fly {{after half an hour}} of endless running. When queens are looking for a host nest or wandering openly, M. vindex foragers may identify a queen and seize her; such behaviour suggests that workers actively recruit fertilised queens for their nest. Host colonies tend to be smaller and depauperated when compared to other colonies without any inquiline queens, but host colonies can still produce alate offspring.|$|E

5|$|Iceland's {{financial}} position has steadily improved since the crash. The economic contraction and rise in unemployment {{appear to have}} been arrested by late 2010 and with growth under way in mid-2011. Three main factors have been <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> regard. First is the emergency legislation passed by the Icelandic parliament in October 2008. It served to minimise the impact of the financial crisis on the country. The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks. The much larger foreign operations of the banks, however, went into receivership.|$|E
5|$|Olfactory {{communication}} is very <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> species. It has roles in alerting {{others of the}} identity, physical state and position of the individual. It is also important in reproduction. Like other slow lorises, the Sunda slow loris has glands on its elbows that exude oils. The gland is licked to spread scent and {{is thought to have}} evolved for communication, but it is toxic to humans. If the person is allergic to the animal they can go into shock and could even die. It also has glands on its anus and can signal conspecifics by perineal rubbing which deposits urine. When it locates the scent of another slow loris it may rub its face on the substrate where the scent was found.|$|E
5|$|Unlike animals, plants lack {{phagocytic}} cells, {{but many}} plant immune responses involve systemic chemical signals that are sent through a plant. Individual plant cells respond to molecules associated with pathogens known as Pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs. When {{a part of}} a plant becomes infected, the plant produces a localized hypersensitive response, whereby cells at the site of infection undergo rapid apoptosis {{to prevent the spread of}} the disease to other parts of the plant. Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a type of defensive response used by plants that renders the entire plant resistant to a particular infectious agent. RNA silencing mechanisms are particularly <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> systemic response as they can block virus replication.|$|E

25|$|The {{metaphase}} checkpoint is {{a fairly}} minor checkpoint, in that once a cell is in metaphase, it has committed to undergoing mitosis.

25|$|Following {{reports from}} missionaries, there was growing moral outrage, {{particularly}} in Britain and the United States. The Congo Reform Association, led by Edmund Dene Morel, was particularly <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> campaign, and published numerous best-selling tracts and pamphlets (including Red Rubber) which reached a vast public.

However, this simplification of 'right' versus 'left' brain thinking is not supported by the research data.|$|E

25|$|Single wicket {{was popular}} in the 18th and 19th centuries and its matches {{generally}} qualify as <b>important.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> form, although each team may have from one to six players, {{there is only one}} batsman in at a time and he must face every delivery bowled while his innings lasts. Single wicket has rarely been played since limited overs cricket began. Matches tended to have two innings per team like a full first-class one and they could end in a draw.|$|E
25|$|In {{the delta}} itself, Caesar makes a passing {{comment about the}} Insula Batavorum ("Island of the Batavi") in the Rhine river, without {{discussing}} who lived there. Later, in imperial times, a tribe called the Batavi became very <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> region. Much later Tacitus wrote that they had originally been a tribe of the Chatti, a tribe in Germany never mentioned by Caesar. However, archaeologists find evidence of continuity, and suggest that the Chattic group {{may have been a}} small group, moving into a pre-existing (and possibly non-Germanic) people, who could even have been part of a known group such as the Eburones.|$|E
25|$|In August 2012, Alexander Sukhorukov, who {{was then}} deputy Defense Minister, said that the armored vehicle BMD-4M {{does not meet the}} {{requirements}} put forward by the Russian military department, and will not be purchased. At the same time a week before, Vladimir Shamanov said the BMD-4M is fully compliant with the VDV, which was more <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> regard than the requirements of the Ministry of Defence. He stressed that the fate of the BMD-4M is decided by the supreme commander Vladimir Putin. The Russian Army received another prototype batch of the modernised BMD-4M airborne assault vehicle during mid-2014. Eight modernized BMD-4M vehicles were delivered to the 106th Guards Airborne Assault Division by Kurganmashzavod, where the vehicles continued to undergo testing.|$|E
