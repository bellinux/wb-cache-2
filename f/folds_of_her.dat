5|$|The {{panel is}} the {{smallest}} extant work by van der Weyden and follows the tradition of a Madonna Lactans, with significant differences. Christ {{is dressed in a}} red garment, as opposed to the swaddling he usually wears in 15th-century Virgin and Child portrayals. This is one of two exceptions where he is fully clothed; the other is Robert Campin's Madonna in Frankfurt, where he is shown in blue clothing. Mary's unbound blond hair falls across her shoulders and down across her arms. Showing the influence of Campin, it is brushed behind the ears. She wears a crown as Queen of Heaven and a ring on a finger as the Bride of Christ. Reinforcing this, the blue colour of her robe alludes to her devotion and fidelity to her son. The <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress are reminiscent of the lengthy, crisp, curved intertwined gowns of Gothic sculpture.|$|E
5|$|A statue by {{sculptor}} Daniel Chester French called Alma Mater {{is centered}} {{on the front steps}} of Low Memorial Library. McKim, Mead & White invited French to build the sculpture in order to harmonize with the larger composition of the court and library {{in the center of the}} campus. Draped in an academic gown, the female figure of Alma Mater wears a crown of laurels and sits on a throne. The scroll-like arms of the throne end in lamps, representing sapientia and doctrina. A book signifying knowledge, balances on her lap, and an owl, the attribute of wisdom, is hidden in the <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> gown. Her right hand holds a scepter composed of four sprays of wheat, terminating with a crown of King's College which refers to Columbia's origin as a Royalist institution in 1754. A local actress named Mary Lawton was said to have posed for parts of the sculpture. The statue was dedicated on September 23, 1903, as a gift of Mr. & Mrs. Robert Goelet, and was originally covered in golden leaf. During the Columbia University protests of 1968 a bomb damaged the sculpture, but it has since been repaired. The small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many Columbia legends, the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian, and that any subsequent Columbia male who finds it will marry a Barnard student, given that Barnard is a women's college.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{the subject}} of L'Âme de la France has its own {{individual}} characteristics that contrast strongly with its martial attributes. First, she was “lovingly fashioned down to the smallest details, from the <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress to her splendid braids”, two long pigtails that “slide down her back”. In addition and even more importantly, she represents a young half-nude woman, her belly and her breasts bared “to the open air”, the slender body and the head turned to the right in a position that is ultimately very sensual.|$|E

60|$|She {{glanced at}} George and spoke composedly, though she hid a {{trembling}} {{hand in a}} <b>fold</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> skirt.|$|R
60|$|One of {{the roses}} had {{remained}} fixed in the stiff <b>fold</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> panier. She took it {{between her fingers}} and sighed.|$|R
25|$|Vermeer {{is known}} to have {{incorporated}} other artists' ideas, techniques and the poses in which they depict subjects. Some features of Diana share the effects and techniques of Rembrandt. Diana's stout figure is much like those in Rembrandt's work, and Vermeer used thick impasto brushwork following the lines of the <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> clothing, as Rembrandt did. Also like Rembrandt, Vermeer cast the faces of the group in shadows, which gives a more expressive, moodier cast to the scene. Vermeer's painting is very similar in feeling to Rembrandt's Bathsheba, painted in 1654, a work Vermeer very likely saw firsthand, according to Wheelock. The poses of the woman whose feet is washed and the one doing the washing are similar. It is possible that Rembrandt's former pupil, Carel Fabritius (in Delft from 1650 until his death in late 1654), may have made Vermeer familiar with Rembrandt's work.|$|E
2500|$|Maria de Medici wears a bodice with split, round hanging sleeves. Her tight undersleeves are chartacteristic of Spanish influence. From the <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> skirt, {{she appears}} to be wearing a small roll over a narrow Spanish farthingale. Note that her oversleeves are the same shape as those worn by Lettice Knollys.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Covenhoven, who {{had served}} under George Washington in the Continental Army, rode west along the ridge of Bald Eagle Mountain to warn {{settlers}} and the militia at Fort Antes. Covenhoven followed the ridge for two reasons: first, experience {{told him that the}} Native Americans would not be on the level summit of the ridge, thus making him safe from personal attack, and second, {{he would be able to}} scout the situation in the valley from atop the ridge. Covenhoven, who was joined by an unnamed employee of Culbertson's Mill in modern Duboistown, was able to see Fort Antes from the ridge. As he slowly approached the stockade, Covenhoven heard the report of a rifle shot and made a run for the fort thinking that he was under fire. This proved to be false - although there were Native Americans in the area and one did fire his weapon, the fire was not aimed at Robert Covenhoven. Instead, a young woman outside the stockade milking a cow was the target, as evidenced by the bullet hole that pierced the <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress. After giving the orders that prompted the Big Runaway, Covenhoven returned to Fort Augusta. Covenhoven is listed as a Fair Play Man and one of the signers of the Tiadaghton Declaration of Independence. Following the war, he continued to serve as a scout on the frontier before retiring to Piatt Township on the north side of the West Branch Susquehanna River.|$|E
60|$|I {{looked at}} her distractedly. She smiled tenderly, and {{slightly}} smoothed down and rearranged a <b>fold</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress to cover her delicate little boot.|$|R
6000|$|Maggie, {{trying to}} follow, almost {{achieved}} a little <b>fold</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> forehead. [...] "I {{strike you as}} modest to-day--modest when I stand here and scream at you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The lady thoughtfully {{smoothed}} out a <b>fold</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress. [...] "Well," [...] {{she said with}} Western frankness, [...] "I want {{to know a little}} about him, too." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} her clenched fist pressed against the <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress.|$|E
60|$|She {{sheathed}} the dagger, and this, too, she {{hid in the}} <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> gown.|$|E
60|$|She bent {{her head}} courteously, drew closer the <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> shawl, and passed from the classe.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah, {{what good}} fortune!' exclaimed the Bassa, 'we shall shortly see the {{beautiful}} Aurora, and Ibrahim shall at once search {{in the fifth}} <b>fold</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> yellow brocade. For it is she no doubt of whom the book speaks.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall have}} more to do, soon," [...] said the curate, his eye glancing towards the schoolmistress, who, {{disturbed}} by the noise above, was walking slowly up the beach, with a child holding to every finger, and every <b>fold</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress.|$|R
6000|$|... "How the safest? What is your protection?" [...] For {{several moments}} that spun {{themselves}} out endlessly she looked me {{straight in the}} face, the stars in her eyes seeming to glow like fire; then, lowering her head, she took a <b>fold</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> shroud {{and held it up}} to me.|$|R
60|$|La Belle Nita smiled. From {{a pocket}} somewhere within the <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> flowing gown, she {{produced}} two small keys.|$|E
6000|$|... "No! but--you know--you told me"--he began hurriedly. But she {{had already}} risen, and was shaking out the <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye," [...] she said, {{gathering}} the <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> pale-blue skirt. [...] "I shall expect you. But not on Thursday evening, remember." ...|$|E
60|$|The knife {{was lying}} in her lap. She let it slip into the <b>fold</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress, and laid her forearms with clasped fingers over her knees, which she pressed desperately together. The dreaded thing {{was out of sight}} at last. She felt a {{dampness}} break out all over her.|$|R
60|$|So saying, she {{seized the}} small cruise which {{contained}} their soup, and {{the meat of}} which it was made, wrapped some thin cakes which she had baked into the <b>fold</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> plaid, and, beckoning her companion to follow with a vessel of milk, also part of their provisions, she hastened towards the garden.|$|R
60|$|I {{was in the}} carrier's cart when I {{heard her}} calling to me. I looked out, and {{she stood at the}} garden-gate alone, holding her baby up in her arms for me to see. It was cold still weather; and not a hair <b>of</b> <b>her</b> head, nor a <b>fold</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress, was stirred, as she looked intently at me, holding up her child.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Macallan {{lifted her}} hand, {{and showed me}} a telegraphic {{dispatch}} which she had hitherto kept concealed in the <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress.|$|E
6000|$|From {{beneath the}} <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cloak {{she drew a}} chain and locket, and holding the latter before Margaret's unwilling eyes, she said ecstatically-- ...|$|E
60|$|Arabella Kinnaird {{gazed at}} it intently {{when she had}} shaken some of the dew from the frills and <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> rather bedraggled skirt.|$|E
6000|$|O blossom {{that hangs}} in the tremulous air! O blossom with lips of snow! Come down, come down, for my love to wear! You will die on her head in a crown, You will die in a <b>fold</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> gown, To her little light heart you will go! O blossom that {{hangs in the}} tremulous air! O blossom with lips of snow! ...|$|R
60|$|For some minutes all {{was a happy}} confusion, and Ibrahim took {{advantage}} of it to fall on his knees before Aurora, and search in the fifth <b>fold</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress for the missing coral bead. The Book of Spells had told the truth; there it was, and as the chaplet was now complete the young man's days of seeking were over.|$|R
60|$|The girl {{turned from}} him, {{and walked slowly}} across the veranda with her back toward her suitor and her face toward the sea, {{so that he could}} not see how one hand slipped without a rustle beneath a <b>fold</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress. He had left her but one way out of the difficulty, and it was dangerous; but gauging the quality <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{antagonist}} she was content to take the risks. The sleepy aunt saw, however, and smiled grimly to herself.|$|R
60|$|Marguerite, who had hastily {{concealed}} {{the ring}} in the <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> kerchief, tried to respond gaily and unconcernedly to the young girl's impulsiveness.|$|E
60|$|And Laura, {{the cool}} blonde, {{disposed}} the <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> white gown more gracefully about her, and touched up the eyebrow of the Minerva she was drawing.|$|E
60|$|Madame bent {{her head}} so that nothing showed but the bright black <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hair. Then she looked up, with a slow, subtle, rather jeering smile.|$|E
6000|$|Making a {{perfunctory}} {{pass with}} the Bissell broom, she runs it to [...] the cupboard, {{comes back to}} the table, takes up a bottle and [...] holds it to the light; finding it empty, she turns it upside [...] down and drops it into the wastepaper basket; then, holding up [...] the other bottle, and finding it not empty, she corks it and [...] drops it into the <b>fold</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> skirt.|$|R
60|$|The man he knew {{by sight}} and {{reputation}} as a very brilliant young lawyer, Edward Benson, of Heron Lake. The girl he knew instantly to be utterly alien to this land and people. She was like a tropic bird seen amid the scant foliage of northern hills. There was evidence of great care and taste in every <b>fold</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> modish dress. Her hat was simple but in the latest city fashion, and her gloves were spotless. She gave off an odor of cleanliness and beauty.|$|R
50|$|The statue is {{generally}} identified as Artemis, virgin goddess of hunting and the wild, solely on account <b>of</b> <b>her</b> clothing. She wears what is effectively a short chiton with large sleeves, {{typical of the}} goddess. The chiton is bound by two belts: one is visible around her waist, the other is hidden, allowing {{a portion of the}} fabric to be gathered, shortening the chiton and exposing the knees. The goddess is represented in the process <b>of</b> pinning <b>her</b> cloak on: her right hand holds a fibula and lifts a <b>fold</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> clothing on her right shoulder while her left hand lifts another <b>fold</b> <b>of</b> cloth up to chest level. The movement causes the collar of the chiton to fall, leaving the left shoulder exposed.|$|R
