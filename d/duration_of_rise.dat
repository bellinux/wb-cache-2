This results are in good agreement with the predictions of Lu et al. (2007) and current popular view on the production of GRBs. We argue that the spectral evolution of tracking pulses may be relate to both of kinematic and dynamic process even if we currently can not provide further evidences to distinguish which one is dominant.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that there is {{temporal}} relationship between coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and associated flares. The <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the acceleration phase is related to the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rise</b> phase <b>of</b> a flare. We investigate CMEs associated with slow long duration events (LDEs), i. e. flares with the long rising phase. We determined the relationships between flares and CMEs and analyzed the CME kinematics in detail. The parameters of the flares (GOES flux, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rising</b> phase) show strong correlations with the CME parameters (velocity, acceleration during main acceleration phase and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the CME acceleration phase). These correlations confirm the strong relation between slow LDEs and CMEs. We also analyzed the relation between the parameters of the CMEs, i. e. a velocity, an acceleration during the main acceleration phase, a <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the acceleration phase, and a height of a CME {{at the end of the}} acceleration phase. The CMEs associated with the slow LDEs are characterized by high velocity during the propagation phase, with the median equal 1423 km/s. In half of the analyzed cases, the main acceleration was low (a< 300 m/s^ 2), which suggests that the high velocity is caused by the prolongated acceleration phase (the median for the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the acceleration phase is equal 90 minutes). The CMEs were accelerated up to several solar radii (with the median 7 Rsun), which is much higher than in typical impulsive CMEs. Therefore, slow LDEs may potentially precede extremely strong geomagnetic storms. The analysis of slow LDEs and associated CMEs may give important information for developing more accurate space weather forecasts, especially for extreme events.

40|$|We {{examine the}} case where a circumstellar medium around a {{supernova}} is sufficiently opaque that a radiation dominated shock propagates in the circum-stellar region. The initial propagation of the shock front into the circumstellar region can be approximated by a self-similar solution that determines the ra-diative energy in a shocked shell; the eventual escape of this energy gives the maximum luminosity of the supernova. If the circumstellar density is described by ρ = Dr− 2 out to a radius Rw, where D is a constant, {{the properties of the}} shock breakout radiation depend on Rw and Rd ≡ κDvsh/c, where κ is the opac-ity and vsh is the shock velocity. If Rw> Rd, the rise to maximum light begins at ∼ Rd/vsh; the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rise</b> is also ∼ Rd/vsh; the outer parts of the opaque medium are extended and at low velocity at the time of peak luminosity; and a dense shell forms whose continued interaction with the dense mass loss gives a characteristic flatter portion of the declining light curve.

40|$|Charge {{transfer}} {{through the}} receptor membrane of the nonmyelinated ending of Pacinian corpuscles is markedly affected by temperature. The rate <b>of</b> <b>rise</b> and the amplitude of the generator potential {{in response to}} a constant mechanical stimulus increase with temperature coefficients of 2. 5 and 2. 0 respectively. The <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the falling phase, presumably a purely passive component, and the <b>rise</b> time <b>of</b> the generator potential are but little affected by temperature. The following interpretation is offered: Mechanical stimulation causes the conductance of the receptor membrane to increase and ions to flow along their electrochemical gradients. An energy barrier of about 16, 000 cal/mole limits the conductance change. The latter increases, thus, steeply with temperature, causing both the rate <b>of</b> <b>rise</b> and the intensity of the generator current to increase. The membrane of the adjacent Ranvier node behaves in a distinctly different manner. The amplitude of the nodal action potential is little changed over a wide range of temperature, while the <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> its <b>rising</b> and falling phases increase markedly. The electrical threshold of the nodal membrane is rather constant between 40 and 12 °C. Below 12 °C the threshold rises, and the mechanically elicited generator current fails to meet the threshold requirements of the first node.

40|$|Although {{snowmelt}} discharge (SMD) is {{a function}} of many variables, only snowpack, river discharge, and air temperature have long-term records, which are the focus of this study. Solar insolation, an important variable, covaries with air temperature and, presumably, much of the air temperature-snowmelt discharge correlation includes solar insolation effects. Two features of the seasonal SMD cycle are the spring pulse, which defines the start <b>of</b> the <b>rise</b> in SMD, and the peak SMD, which defines the start of the decline in SMD. Air temperature leads SMD, throughout the snowmelt season, from zero to a few days. Apparently the lead/lag variations depend on the rates and <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> <b>rising</b> and falling air temperatures. On average, however, the lead time between air temperature variations and the SMD response is longer near the start of the snowmelt season and decreases as snowmelt progresses towards the peak SMD. This pattern is most likely caused by the seasonal increase in air temperature driven response as SMD progresses. Initially, the SMD response is slow as the snowpack takes time to ripen. Another, but likely smaller, contributing factor is the seasonal change in the air temperature variation which begins to decrease near day 150 (note: the range in maximum discharge extends beyond day 150 to 182). Further, the timing of the start of the SMD season (the spring pulse) depends more on air temperature (cool or warm) than winter snowpack (wet or dry). However, as the SMD season progresses towards maximum discharge, this pattern changes and the importance of differences in winter snowpack on SMD timing increases while the importance of differences in air temperature decreases...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{research}} on sediment transport in gravel bed rivers shows {{evidence of the}} influence of sub-threshold flow history on values of entrainment thresholds (Paphitis and Collins, 2005; Monteith and Pender, 2005; Haynes and Pender, 2007; Haynes and Ockelford, 2008). The research presented here analyses the effect of the characteristics <b>of</b> hydrograph <b>rising</b> limbs (flow magnitude and duration) on entrainment thresholds of gravel beds, with discharges ranging from 0. 25 - 1. 6 times the estimated bed threshold flow and durations from 0. 5 h to 6 h. This analysis uses results from flume experimentation. Entrainment thresholds were determined by two well documented methods: a) particle movement counts (visual method, Yalin, 1977); and b) the reference transport method (RTM) (Parker et al., 1982 a; Shvidchenko et al., 2001). Results obtained with near-uniform and uniform bed material sizes show a clear influence of flow magnitude and duration on entrainment thresholds, with bed resistance increasing up to c. 25 % for longer <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> antecedent flows when using the visual method, similarly to Paphitis and Collins (2005). The results from the unimodal gravel bed suggest an intermediate <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>rising</b> limb (c. 2 h) producing the strongest bed, with more mobile beds resulting from both shorter and longer rising limbs. Total bedload transport rates reduce with increased bed resistance, this effect is also noted during the stability test phase. These results are used to develop a new simplified method for estimating critical bed shear stress using only total bedload data. The performance of a new formulation for bedload rates derived in this thesis is tested against a number of traditional bedload transport equations and appropriately discussed. In-depth analyses of bed surface and bedload size composition and surface grain structure show that bed surface undergoes little change of size composition, with a slightly proportionally larger reduction of fine content, suggesting penetration of fines below the surface. The analysis of coarse-grain bed surface structures, mobility and clustering, based on the size class containing D 90 and using digital images taken under UV light, suggests that the surface distribution of coarse grains has a primary role on bed stability.

This mass loss rate is higher than that typically observed for red supergiants.

A serial CK-MB mass determination is particularly suitable for this exclusion of myocardial damage. The sensitivity of TnT shortly after an infarction is comparable with that of CK-MB mass; a single determination on admission is insufficient. The marker myoglobin is of limited value owing to the brief <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> myoglobin <b>rise</b> and insufficient heart specificity. An increased TnT or TnI value in patients with unstable angina pectoris is a prognostically negative sign. It is still not clear how this prognosis can be improved. A negative troponin finding appears not to exclude early complications. The department of Emergency Cardiac Care of the Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, the Netherlands, currently prefers the serial measurement of the CK-MB mass, in the future possibly to be supplemented by a troponin determinatio...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{stepping}} {{behavior of}} the dimeric kinesin is studied by using our model based on previous biochemical, X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy studies. It is shown that, when a Pi is released from the trailing head, a forward step is made under a backward load smaller than the stall force; while when a Pi is released from the leading head, no stepping is made under a forward load or no load, and a backward step is made under a backward load. The forward stepping time, i. e., the time from the release of Pi in the trailing head to the binding of the ADP head to next binding site, is {{much smaller than the}} dwell time even under the backward load near the stall force. Thus the movement velocity of the kinesin dimer can be considered to be only dependent on ATPase rates of the two heads. The <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rising</b> phase, i. e., the actual time taken by the ADP head to transit from the trailing to leading positions, is on the time scale of microseconds under any backward load smaller than the stall force. This is consistent with available experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Two {{lines of}} mice have been {{separated}} by selective breeding {{for the character}} "agglutinin production to heterologous erythrocytes. " Around the 18 th generation of selection the two lines could be considered as homozygous for the character investigated. This trait is {{under the control of}} a group of additive genes. The interline difference in the production of anti-SE agglutinins was verified for the range of antigen doses from subimmunogenic to maximal. After intravenous immunization with an optimal dose <b>of</b> SE, the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the exponential <b>rise</b> in serum antibody was 4 – 5 days in both lines. At this time most of the interline difference in responsiveness is already expressed. A cytodynamic study carried out in terms of plaque-forming cells (PFC) and rosette-forming cells (RFC) in the spleen during the exponential phase showed that the principal interline difference is found in the doubling time of cells engaged in the immune response. More precise cytodynamic analysis made in terms of RFC showed that the doubling time of RFC is 9 hr in high responder and 16 hr in low responder mice. The <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the exponential <b>rise</b> and the number of target cells stimulated by antigen is the same in both lines. The interline difference at the end <b>of</b> the exponential <b>rise</b> (4 days postimmunization) is larger in terms of serum antibody (30 – 40 -fold) than in terms of PFC or RFC (20 - and 11 -fold, respectively). A morphological study of RFC in nonimmunized mice showed that about 90 % of rosettes were formed by small lymphocytes in both lines. The remainder were medium-sized lymphocytes. At the peak of the cellular response the RFC have differentiated into large lymphocytes, blast cells, and plasma cells. The contribution of plasma cells to RFC is much greater in the high than in the low line. The cytodynamic and morphologic results presented in this article are compatible with the hypothesis that the group of genes segregated in each line during the selective breeding control and regulate the rate of multiplication and differentiation of the antibody-producing cells...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of soft X-ray (SXR) and extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) observations of solar flares with an approximate C 8 GOES class. Our constraint on peak GOES SXR flux allows for the investigation of correlations between various flare parameters. We show that the the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the decay phase of a flare {{is proportional to the}} <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> its <b>rise</b> phase. Additionally, we show significant correlations between the radiation emitted in the flare rise and decay phases. These results suggest that the total radiated energy of a given flare is proportional to the energy radiated during the rise phase alone. This partitioning of radiated energy between the rise and decay phases is observed in both SXR and EUV wavelengths. Though observations from the EVE show significant variation in the behavior of individual EUV spectral lines during different C 8 events, this work suggests that broadband EUV emission is well constrained. Furthermore, GOES and AIA data, allow us to determine several thermal parameters (e. g. temperature, volume, density, and emission measure) for the flares within our sample. Analysis of these parameters demonstrate that, within this constrained GOES class, the longer duration solar flares are cooler events with larger volumes capable of emitting vast amounts of radiation. The shortest C 8 flares are typically the hottest events, smaller in physical size, and have lower associated total energies. These relationships are directly comparable with several scaling laws and flare loop models...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Starving amoebae of Dictyostelium discoideum {{communicate}} by relaying extracellular cAMP signals, which direct chemotactic movement, {{resulting in the}} aggregation of thousands of cells into multicellular aggregates. Both cAMP relay and chemotaxis require the activation of PI 3 kinase signaling. The spatiotemporal dynamics of PI 3 kinase signaling can be followed in individual cells via the cAMP-induced membrane recruitment of a GFP-tagged PH domain-containing protein, CRAC, which {{is required for the}} activation of adenylylcyclase. Results: We show that polarized periodic CRAC-GFP translocation occurs during the aggregation and mound stages of development in response to periodic cAMP signals. The <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> CRAC translocation to the membrane is determined by the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rising</b> phase <b>of</b> the cAMP signal. The system shows rapid adaptation and responds to the rate of change of the extracellular cAMP concentration. When the cells are in close contact, it takes 10 s for the signal to propagate from one cell to the next. In slugs, all cells show a permanent polarized PI 3 kinase signaling in their leading edge, which is dependent on cell-cell contact. Conclusions: Measuring the redistribution of GFP-tagged CRAC has enabled us to study the dynamics of PI 3 kinase-mediated cell-cell communication at the individual cell level in the multicellular stages of Dictyostelium development. This approach should also be useful to study the interactions between cell-cell signaling, cell polarization, and movement in the development of other organisms...|$|R
