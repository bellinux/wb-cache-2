25|$|Because the sectors have {{constant}} angular size, the 512 bytes in each sector are compressed more {{near the}} disk's center. A more space-efficient technique {{would be to}} increase the number of sectors per track toward the outer edge of the disk, from 18 to 30 for instance, thereby keeping nearly constant the amount of physical disk space used for storing each sector; an example is zone bit recording. Apple implemented this in early Macintosh computers by spinning the disk more slowly when the head was at the edge, while maintaining the data rate, allowing 400 KB of storage per side and an extra 160 KB on a <b>double-sided</b> <b>disk.</b> This higher capacity came with a disadvantage: the format used a unique drive mechanism and control circuitry, meaning that Mac disks could not be read on other computers. Apple eventually reverted to constant angular velocity on HD floppy disks with their later machines, still unique to Apple as they supported the older variable-speed formats.|$|E

50|$|The Compaq Portable has {{basically}} the same hardware as an IBM PC, transplanted into a luggable case (specifically designed to fit as carry-on luggage on an airplane), with Compaq's BIOS instead of IBM's.

5000|$|Manufacturers sold both {{single-sided}} and <b>double-sided</b> <b>disks</b> {{with the}} <b>double-sided</b> <b>disks</b> being typically 50% {{more expensive than}} single-sided disks. While the magnetic-coated medium was coated on both sides, the single-sided floppies had a read-write notch on only one side, thus allowing only {{one side of the}} disk to be used. When users discovered this, they began buying the less-expensive single-sided disks and [...] "notching" [...] them using scissors, a hole punch, or a specially-designed [...] "notcher" [...] to allow them to write to the reverse side of the disk.|$|R
50|$|When the Atari XF551 drive came out, {{not only}} was it Atari's first drive that could read double-density disks, it was also double-sided. So support was added in the DOS for double-density and <b>double-sided</b> <b>disks.</b>|$|R

50|$|The 88/MS (Mass Storage) was {{a cabinet}} housing dual, 8-inch (full size) floppy drives.

50|$|Early floppy disks {{only used}} one surface for recording. The term {{single-sided}} disk was not common until {{the introduction of}} the <b>double-sided</b> <b>disk,</b> which offered double the capacity in the same physical size.

50|$|However, unlike VFAT, OS/A+ 4.1 disks {{were not}} {{backward}} compatible with earlier systems; Atari DOS or OS/A+ 2.1 {{could not read}} disks formatted by OS/A+ 4.1, breaking backward compatibility. The memory footprint was larger as well, resulting in insufficient memory to run some popular applications. As {{a result of these}} drawbacks, OS/A+ 4.1 did not achieve the market penetration as the earlier product. OSS did reissue OS/A+ 4.1 for a brief period when they decided not to modify DOS XL for <b>double-sided</b> <b>disk</b> support.|$|E
50|$|Early {{systems could}} be fitted with an {{optional}} single density {{floppy disk controller}} card that could interfaced to either internal 5¼-inch or external 8-inch floppy disk drives. Disk capacity was 80 KB per side on 5¼-inch disks and 250.25 KB per side on 8-inch disks. <b>Double-sided</b> <b>disk</b> drives were treated as two independent disks with a drive letter per side. CP/M used the first 4 tracks on 5¼-inch disks and the first 3 tracks on 8-inch disks, reducing the usable capacity of a single density, single-sided 5¼-inch disk to 72 KB.|$|E
25|$|Single sided disks were {{coated on}} both sides, despite the {{availability}} of more expensive double sided disks. The reason usually given for the higher cost was that double sided disks were certified error-free {{on both sides of}} the media. <b>Double-sided</b> <b>disks</b> could be used in some drives for single-sided disks, as long as an index signal was not needed. This was done one side at a time, by turning them over (flippy disks); more expensive dual-head drives which could read both sides without turning over were later produced, and eventually became used universally.|$|R

50|$|Like its Z80-based predecessors, the CoCo shipped with {{a version}} of BASIC. Tandy {{licensed}} Microsoft BASIC; as with the Z80 systems, there are multiple levels of BASIC. The original CoCo offered standard Color BASIC and Extended Color BASIC. This was further extended by a Disk Extended Color BASIC ROM included in the floppy controller. The CoCo 3 included Super Extended Color BASIC as standard, deploying extensions added by Microware. Third-party floppy controller ROMs, such as J&M System JDOS, and DSS Peripherals Disk Controller, enabled the use of <b>double-sided</b> <b>disk</b> drives.|$|E
50|$|Fusion {{was created}} by Bullfrog Productions, a {{development}} studio founded by game designer Peter Molyneux. It was the company's first original product and second game overall, after a port of the shoot 'em up Druid II: Enlightenment. As with Druid II and the later Populous, artist Glenn Corpes created most of the graphics and animation for Fusion, while Molyneux handled {{the majority of its}} programming and design. The game was coded in assembly language, and the Atari ST version implemented HiSoft Systems' Devpac II assembler. Its soundtrack, available on the <b>double-sided</b> <b>disk</b> release, was composed by David Hanlon. Fusion was released in 1988.|$|E
50|$|In 1989, ALF {{used the}} {{electronics}} of the 800-series {{to create the}} 100-series of copying controllers for automatic loaders. Each 100-series unit operated a single automatic loader, but it could copy {{both sides of a}} <b>double-sided</b> <b>disk</b> simultaneously (all of ALF's earlier copiers, and all drives used in computers, could only read or write {{to one side of the}} disk at any given moment) and could handle drives that spin twice as fast as normal. Virtually every manufacturer of automatic loaders in the U.S. offered at least one product using ALF's 100-series (companies included Ashby Industries, CopyMaster, Costas Systems, MissionSix, Rimage Corporation, Trace Corporation, and Victory Enterprises). Most built the 100-series electronics directly inside their loader, but ALF also offered a compact metal enclosure that could be located on top of the loader or nearby.|$|E
50|$|The computer's only {{available}} form of mass storage was the port for a cassette audiotape recorder, which was notoriously finicky and unreliable. Many times several attempts {{to read a}} tape were required, along with much adjustment of the volume setting. A popular alternative was the Tandy Portable Disk Drive (TPDD), a serial device capable of storing 100 KB of data on a 3.5-inch diskette; this drive {{is identical to the}} Brother FB100 drive for knitting machines. A second version, the TPDD2, can store up to 200 KB, as it uses both sides of <b>double-sided</b> <b>disks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Access Computer had dual 5.25-inch floppy drives (either 320k-DS or 168k-SS) a {{detachable}} keyboard, a 7" [...] built-in amber CRT monitor, and {{a built-in}} 80 CPS Epson MX80 {{dot matrix printer}} with GRAFTRAX-80 chipset. It used the CP/M operating system, and also included a Bell-103 300baud modem with both acoustic-coupled and direct connections. Additional connectors for IEEE-488 (external hard disk), composite monitor, RS2-32 serial and Centronics parallel were provided. The mainboard has a 50-pin header designed to support 8-inch disk drives (4 heads on two <b>double-sided</b> <b>disks</b> - drive letters C:/D: and E:/F:) ...|$|R
5000|$|Aside from faster access, {{the drive}} {{is very similar}} to the 1541. Like the 1541, it is a {{single-sided}} 170-kilobyte drive for 5¼" [...] disks, with each disk split into 664 256-byte blocks available for user data plus 19 blocks for DOS data and directory; the file system makes each block its own cluster. As with the other Commodore single-sided diskette drives, 1540 and 1541, both sides of double-sided media could be used only after punching a second write-protection marker hole in the diskette's jacket and inserting the medium upside-down into the drive. This became common practice, even more so since single-sided media became rarely available with prices matching those of <b>double-sided</b> <b>disks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The 1571 was {{released}} {{to match the}} Commodore 128, both design-wise and feature-wise. It was announced {{in the summer of}} 1985, {{at the same time as}} the C128, and became available in quantity later that year. The later C128D had a 1571-compatible drive integrated in the system unit. A <b>double-sided</b> <b>disk</b> on the 1571 would have a capacity of 340 kB (70 tracks, 1,360 disk blocks of 256 bytes each); as 8 kB are reserved for system use (directory and block availability information) and, under CBM DOS, 2 bytes of each block serve as pointers to the next logical block, 254 x 1,328 = 337,312 B or about 329.4 kB were available for user data. (However, with a program organizing disk storage on its own, all space could be used, e.g. for data disks.) ...|$|E

5000|$|Because {{graphics}} {{support in}} MS-DOS is extremely limited, MS-DOS applications {{have to go}} to the bare hardware (or sometimes just to the BIOS) to get work done. Therefore, Windows 1.0 included original device drivers for video cards, a mouse, keyboards, printers and serial communications, and applications were supposed to only invoke APIs built upon these drivers. However, this extended to other APIs such as file system management functions. In this sense, Windows 1.0 was designed to be extended into a full-fledged operating system, rather than being just a graphics environment used by applications. Indeed, Windows 1.0 is a [...] "DOS front-end" [...] and cannot operate without a DOS environment (it uses, for example, the file-handling functions provided by DOS.) The level of replacement increases in subsequent versions. The system requirements for Windows 1.01 constituted CGA/HGC/EGA (listed as [...] "Monochrome or color monitor"), MS-DOS 2.0, 256 KB of memory or greater, and two <b>double-sided</b> <b>disk</b> drives or a hard drive. Beginning with version 1.03, support for Tandy and AT&T graphics modes was added.|$|E

50|$|Like the 5¼-inch, the 3½-inch disk {{underwent}} {{an evolution}} of its own. When Apple introduced the Macintosh in 1984, it used single-sided 3½-inch disk drives with an advertised capacity of 400 kB. The encoding technique used by these drives {{was known as}} GCR, or Group Coded Recording (similar recording methods were used by Commodore on its 5¼-inch drives and Sirius Systems Technology in its Victor 9000 non-PC-compatible MS-DOS machine). Somewhat later, PC-compatible machines began using single-sided 3½-inch disks with an advertised capacity of 360 kB (the same as a <b>double-sided</b> 5¼-inch <b>disk),</b> and a different, incompatible recording format called MFM (Modified Frequency Modulation). GCR and MFM drives (and their formatted disks) were incompatible, although the physical disks were the same. In 1986, Apple introduced <b>double-sided,</b> 800 kB <b>disks,</b> still using GCR, and soon after, IBM began using 720 kB <b>double-sided</b> double-density MFM <b>disks</b> in PCs like the IBM PC Convertible. IBM PC compatibles adopted it too, whilst the Amiga used MFM encoding on the same disks to give a capacity of 1 MB (880 KB available once formatted).|$|R
5000|$|Later, {{double-sided}} drives, {{with heads}} to read {{both sides of}} the disk, became available from third-party companies. (Apple only produced <b>double-sided</b> 5.25" [...] <b>disks</b> for the Lisa 1 computer).|$|R
50|$|Very early {{machines}} {{included the}} OS on a floppy disk due to it not being {{ready to be}} burned to ROM (like the Amiga 1000 had). This early version of TOS was bootstrapped from a very small core boot ROM, but this was quickly replaced with (expanded capacity) ROM versions of TOS 1.0 when it was ready. (This change was also greatly welcomed as older ST machines with memory below 512 kB suffered, as GEM loaded its entire 192 kB code into RAM when booting the desktop). Having the OS loaded from disk was due to Atari trying to rush the machines to market without ironing out all the bugs in the OS. Soon after this change, most production models became STFs, with an integrated single- (520STF/512 kB RAM) or double-sided (1040STF/1024 kB RAM) double density floppy disk drive built-in, but no other changes. The next later models used an upgraded version of TOS: 1.02 (also known as TOS 1.2). Another early addition (after about 6 months) was an RF Modulator that allows the machine to be hooked to a color TV when run in its low or medium resolution (525/625 line 60/50 Hz interlace, even on RGB monitors) modes, greatly enhancing the machine's saleability and perceived value (no need to buy a prohibitively expensive, even if exceptionally crisp and clear, monitor). These models were known as the 520STM (or 520STM). Later F and FM models of the 520 had a built in <b>double-sided</b> <b>disk</b> drive instead of a single-sided one.|$|E

50|$|North Star later updated {{the disk}} drive to support double-density disks with 180 kB, and later still <b>double-sided,</b> double-density <b>disks</b> with 360 kB of storage.

5000|$|The Apple Disk II stored 140 kB on single-sided, [...] "single-density" [...] floppy disks, but it {{was very}} common for Apple II users to extend the {{capacity}} of a single-sided floppy disk to 280 kB by cutting out a second write-protect notch {{on the side of the}} disk using a [...] "disk notcher" [...] or hole puncher and inserting the <b>disk</b> flipped over. <b>Double-sided</b> <b>disks,</b> with notches on both sides, were available at a higher price, but in practice the magnetic coating on the reverse of nominally single-sided disks was usually of good enough quality to be used (both sides were coated in the same way to prevent warping, although only one side was certified for use). Early on, diskette manufacturers routinely warned that this technique would damage the read/write head of the drives or wear out the disk faster, and these warnings were frequently repeated in magazines of the day. In practice, however, this method was an inexpensive way to store twice as much data for no extra cost, and was widely used for commercially released floppies as well.|$|R
