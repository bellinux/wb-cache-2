40|$|Little {{information}} concerning the genome of either Campylobacter jejuni or Campylobacter coli is available. Therefore, we constructed genomic maps of C. jejuni UA 580 and C. coli UA 417 by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The genome sizes of C. jejuni and C. coli strains are approximately 1. 7 Mb, as determined by SalI and SmaI digestion (N. Chang and D. E. Taylor, J. Bacteriol. 172 : 5211 - 5217, 1990). The genomes of both species are represented by single circular DNA molecules, and maps were constructed by partial restriction digestion and hybridization of DNA fragments extracted from low-melting-point agarose gels. <b>Homologous</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>probes,</b> encoding the flaAB and 16 S rRNA genes, as well as heterologous <b>DNA</b> <b>probes</b> from Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Haemophilus influenzae, were used to identify the locations of particular genes. C. jejuni and C. coli contain three copies of the 16 S and 23 S rRNA genes. However, they are not located together within an operon but show a distinct split {{in at least two}} of their three copies. The positions of various housekeeping genes in both C. jejuni UA 580 and C. coli UA 417 have been determined, and there appears to be some conservation of gene arrangement between the two species...|$|R
40|$|The hyperthermophilic {{bacterium}} Thermotoga species strain RQ 7 harbors an 846 -bp plasmid, pRQ 7, with {{a single}} open reading frame. Previously published analyses of the DNA sequence of pRQ 7 suggested that it may replicate by a rolling-circle (RC) replication mechanism, and this report provides experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis. Single-stranded pRQ 7 DNA accumulates in strain RQ 7, {{as evidenced by the}} facts that this DNA bound to nitrocellulose membranes under nondenaturing conditions, was sensitive to S 1 nuclease digestion, and hybridized to only one of two <b>homologous</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>probes</b> specific for each strand of the plasmid. The DNA encoding the open reading frame was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and gave a protein with a molecular mass of 26 kDa, similar to that deduced by sequence analysis. This protein bound to a fragment of pRQ 7 that contains a putative double-stranded replication region in a magnesium-dependent reaction and made this fragment sensitive to S 1 nuclease activity. It did not cause this same S 1 nuclease sensitivity in the remainder of pRQ 7. This activity on pRQ 7 DNA suggests that this protein plays a role in plasmid replication...|$|R

By using different bacteriophage <b>DNA</b> <b>probes,</b> the diversity of the bacteriophage population in sewage was estimated to be higher than that in other natural samples. The indication that transducing phages and prophages are widely distributed in the Pseudomonas populations investigated has considerable implications for the frequency of natural gene transfer by transduction and of lysogenic conversion of host bacteria in natural ecosystems...|$|R

These experiments indicate that a stretched unwound DNA locally denatures to alleviate the force-driven increase in torsional stress. This is detected by hybridization with 1 kb of <b>homologous</b> single-stranded <b>DNA</b> <b>probes.</b> The stretching force involved (â‰ˆ 2 pN) is small compared with those typically developed by molecular motors, suggesting that this process may be relevant to DNA processing in vivo.

40|$|Summary Recent {{molecular}} {{genetic data}} suggest that cellu-lose synthase (CesA) genes coding for the enzymes that cata-lyze cellulose biosynthesis (CESAs) in Arabidopsis and other herbaceous plants belong to a large gene family. Much less is known about CesA genes from forest trees. To isolate new CesA genes from tree species, discriminative but easily obtainable <b>homologous</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>probes</b> are required. Hypervariable regions (HVRII) of CesA genes represent highly divergent DNA se-quences {{that can be used}} to examine structural, expressional and functional relationships among CesA genes. We used a re-verse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) -based technique to identify HVRII regions from eight types of CesA genes and two types of CesA-like D (CslD) genes in quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.). Comparison of these aspen CESA/CSLD HVRII regions with the predicted proteins from eight full-length CesA/CslD cDNAs available in our laboratory and with searches for aspen CesA/CslD homologs in the recently released Populus trichocarpa Torr. & A. Gray. genome confirmed the utility of this approach in iden-tifying several CesA/CslD gene members from the Populus ge-nome. Phylogenetic analysis of 56 HVRII domains from a variety of plant species suggested that at least six distinct classes of CESAs exist in plants, supporting a previous pro-posal for renaming HVRII regions as class-specific regions (CSR). This method of CSR cloning could be applied to other crop plants and tree species, especially softwoods, for which the whole genome sequence is unlikely to become available in the near future because of the large size of these genomes...|$|R
40|$|The DNA {{hybridization}} assay for genes encoding for Escherichia coli enterotoxins {{was used to}} examine water specimens in Thailand. In a reconstruction experiment, the DNA {{hybridization assay}} was 10 (4) times more sensitive than testing random E. coli in the Y- 1 adrenal and suckling mouse assays in identifying enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) in water. Drinking and bathing water collected from 2 of 10 different homes of individuals with ETEC-associated diarrhea and 6 % (5 of 78) and 11 % (11 of 78) of drinking and bathing water samples collected from homes of individuals with diarrhea without ETEC infections, as well as 6 % (5 of 77) and 8 % (6 of 77) of drinking and bathing water collected from homes in which no inhabitants had diarrhea, were <b>homologous</b> with the <b>DNA</b> <b>probes.</b> Ten E. coli from each of the 31 water specimens which contained bacteria which were <b>homologous</b> with the <b>DNA</b> <b>probes</b> were tested in the Y- 1 adrenal and suckling mouse assay. In only 2 of these 31 specimens could ETEC be identified with the standard assays. The DNA hybridization assay is a much more sensitive means of detecting organisms carrying genes coding for enterotoxin production than testing 10 individual colonies in the Y- 1 adrenal and suckling mouse assays. This novel application of recombinant DNA technology provides a sensitive method of detecting organisms carrying genes coding for enterotoxin, and this method will be useful in defining the epidemiology of ETEC...|$|R

40|$|Yersinia enterocolitica is a {{heterogeneous}} group of organisms {{with more than}} 50 serotypes and several biotypes. Only {{a few of these}} serotypes cause gastrointestinal disease in otherwise healthy hosts; these serotypes are the pathogenic serotypes. Although Y. enterocolitica requires a high-molecular-weight plasmid to cause disease, chromosome-encoded determinants are required for the full expression of virulence. The ability of Yersinia spp. to invade eucaryotic cells is thought to be a virulence factor, because nonpathogenic serotypes are noninvasive in animals and in tissue culture cell models. Current evidence indicates that invasion ability is chromosome encoded. We recently reported cloning two loci, inv and ail, from Y. enterocolitica O 8 strain 8081 c that allow Escherichia coli to invade tissue culture cells. We investigated the link between invasion in an in vitro tissue culture invasion (TCI) model and hybridization to probes derived from the two invasion loci, inv and ail. We examined 177 Yersinia strains. Strains of serotypes and species associated with disease were TCI+, whereas strains of serotypes and species not associated with disease were TCI-. Only TCI+ strains had <b>DNA</b> <b>homologous</b> to <b>probes</b> derived from ail. All strains (TCI+ and TCI-) had <b>DNA</b> <b>homologous</b> to <b>probes</b> derived from inv, but there were certain restriction fragment-linked polymorphisms that were associated primarily with TCI+ strains. These observations held true for strains epidemiologically associated with disease. Both the inv and ail loci were found to be clearly located on the chromosome. No other genera, including other invasive organisms, had <b>DNA</b> <b>homologous</b> to inv or ail. These data support the hypothesis that the ail locus encodes a Y. enterocolitica invasion factor that may be involved in pathogenesis...|$|R

The organisms with homology to the <b>DNA</b> <b>probe</b> included two human and six nonhuman A. viscosus, three human and three nonhuman A. naeslundii, and two A. bovis isolates. <b>Homologous</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences were not detected in strains of A. odontolyticus and A. israelii examined in this study. Northern (RNA) blot analysis revealed expression of a transcript from each of the A. viscosus and A. naeslundii strains and from one A. bovis strain that was comparable in size to that detected from A. viscosus T 14 V. Cell surface fimbriae were observed on a majority of the strains that expressed the transcript. Various degrees of cross-immunoreactivities between these strains and antibodies specific for type 1 fimbriae of A. viscosus T 14 V were also observed by colony immunoassay. Thus, the data clearly demonstrate the existence in, and expression by, divergent Actinomyces groups of genomic sequences that are closely related to the type 1 fimbriae of A. viscosus T 14 V...|$|R
40|$|Phage phi W- 14 DNA (in which {{one-half}} of the thymine residues are replaced by alpha-putrescinyl thymine) was taken up by competent Bacillus subtilis cells at a rate threefold higher than the rate of <b>homologous</b> <b>DNA</b> uptake. In contrast to other types of heterologous DNA, the amount of phi W- 14 DNA taken up in 15 min exceeded the amount of <b>homologous</b> <b>DNA</b> taken up {{by a factor of}} two to three, as measured in terms of acid-precipitable material. The amount of phi W- 14 DNA taken up was even greater than this analysis indicated if allowance was made for the fact that phi W- 14 DNA was degraded more rapidly after uptake than <b>homologous</b> <b>DNA.</b> Competition experiments showed that the affinity of phi W- 14 <b>DNA</b> for <b>homologous</b> <b>DNA</b> receptors was lower than the affinity of <b>homologous</b> <b>DNA</b> and was similar to the affinities of other types of heterologous DNA. The more rapid and more extensive uptake of phi W- 14 DNA appeared to occur via receptors other than the receptors for <b>homologous</b> <b>DNA,</b> and these receptors (like those for <b>homologous</b> <b>DNA)</b> were an intrinsic property of competent cells. Uptake of phi W- 14 DNA was affected by temperature, azide, EDTA, and chloramphenicol, as was uptake of <b>homologous</b> <b>DNA.</b> This was consistent with entry of both DNAs by means of active transport. After uptake, undegraded phi W- 14 [3 H]DNA was found in the cells in a single-stranded form, whereas a portion of the label was associated with recipient DNA, presumably as a result of incorporation of monomers resulting from degradation. Acetylation of the amino groups of the putrescine side chains in phi W- 14 DNA decreased the affinity of this DNA for its receptors without affecting its ability to compete with <b>homologous</b> <b>DNA...</b>|$|R

The frequencies of Hg(r) bacteria in the total cultivable populations were 0. 05 (SB), 0. 69 (SO), 4. 8 (SE), and 25 (T 2). Between 35 and 100 of the isolates from the four sites contained <b>DNA</b> sequences <b>homologous</b> to a <b>DNA</b> <b>probe</b> from the mercury resistance (mer) operon of the Tn 501 Hg(r) determinant. The mer sequences of 10 Tn 501 -homologous Hg(r) determinants from each site were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, with primers designed to consensus sequences of the mer determinants of Tn 501, Tn 21, and pMJ 100, and were classified {{on the basis of}} the size of the amplified product and the restriction fragment length polymorphism pattern. Two main groups of amplification product were identified. The first, represented by the T 2 and SB isolates and one SE isolate, gave an amplification product indistinguishable in size from that amplified from Tn 501 (~ 1, 010 bp). The second group, represented by the SO isolates and the majority of the SE isolates, produced larger amplification products of 1, 040 or 1, 060 bp.

40|$|Bordetella bronchiseptica is a ureolytic {{mammalian}} respiratory pathogen. We {{have investigated}} the regulation of urease in B. bronchiseptica and the potential role of this enzyme in eukaryotic invasion and intracellular survival. Our results indicate urease is a bordetella virulence repressed gene. Urease activity in virulent B. bronchiseptica BB 7865 is up-regulated from basal levels by 5 gl 1 magnesium sulphate at 37 degrees C. At 30 degrees C, urease activity remained at basal levels, even in the presence on magnesium sulphate, suggesting a second temperature dependent mechanism of urease regulation was also operating. Urease was not inducible by 10 mM urea nor up-regulated in nitrogen limiting conditions. To evaluate the role of urease in intracellular invasion and survival urease-negative mutants of B. bronchiseptica BB 7865 and B. bronchiseptica BB 7866 were created by transposon mutagenesis, and compared to the urease-positive parental strains in a HeLa cell invasion assay. We demonstrate that increasing the concentration of urea in the assay increased survival of the urease-positive but not urease-negative strains after 24 h, suggesting that urease does {{have a role in}} intracellular survival. Partial DNA sequence analysis of an 11. 0 kb EcoRI DNA fragment encoding urease activity revealed an open reading frame containing 50 %, 45 %, 45 %, and 41 % homology to the UreA urease subunit protein of Klebsiella aerogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Helicobacter pylori and Proteus mirabilis respectively.

The sensitivity and specificity of the <b>DNA</b> <b>probe</b> were 93. 9 and 97. 4 %, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of direct immunofluorescence were 68. 9 and 99. 6 %, respectively. The low specificity of the <b>DNA</b> <b>probe</b> resulted in an unacceptable positive predictive value (60. 8 %). False-positive <b>DNA</b> <b>probe</b> tests were not due to nonspecific binding of the probe or to technical problems but were associated with one lot of probe reagent.
