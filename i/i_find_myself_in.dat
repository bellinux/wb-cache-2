500|$|In 1931 Friedrich Hayek {{extensively}} critiqued Keynes's 1930 Treatise on Money. After reading Hayek's The Road to Serfdom, Keynes {{wrote to}} Hayek [...] "Morally and philosophically <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> agreement with virtually {{the whole of}} it", but concluded the letter with the recommendation: [...] On the pressing issue of the time, whether deficit spending could lift a country from depression, Keynes replied to Hayek's criticism in the following way: ...|$|E
500|$|Xhinovci {{is unable}} to return to Germany because of his appearance, as the country has a series of laws which {{prohibit}} Nazi symbols, uniforms, slogans and forms of greeting. He has expressed a great dislike of Serbs, and says {{that he would have}} to carry a concealed handgun every time he wished to visit the Serb-held section of Mitrovica. Xhinovci says that he is greatly disappointed with post-war Kosovo, as he believed that reconciliation between Albanians and Serbs would have occurred after the conflict. When asked if it was difficult to portray Hitler, Xhinovci responded: [...] "It is easy. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> Hitler's character because he fought against my enemy. The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Yes, Serbs are my enemies." [...] About his physical similarity to Hitler, he says: [...] "I am not a dictator like him, but it is of great financial benefit that I resemble him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Adams {{described}} himself as a [...] "radical atheist", adding [...] "radical" [...] for emphasis so he would not be asked if he meant agnostic. He told American Atheists that this conveyed the fact that he really meant it. He imagined a sentient puddle who wakes up one morning and thinks, [...] "This is an interesting world <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> – an interesting hole <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> – fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!" [...] to demonstrate his view that the fine-tuned Universe argument for God was a fallacy.|$|E

6000|$|... "That {{was some}} time ago. Things are {{changing}} around us every day. It {{is possible that}} within {{a very short time}} <b>I</b> may <b>find</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> such a position here that I am forced to know exactly who are my friends and who my enemies." ...|$|R
2500|$|... {{imagine a}} puddle waking {{up one morning}} and thinking, 'This is an {{interesting}} world <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in,</b> an interesting hole <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in,</b> fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact, it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!' This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and as, gradually, the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it's still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be all right, because this World was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise. I think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for.|$|E
2500|$|John Maynard Keynes said of it: [...] "In {{my opinion}} it {{is a grand}} book...Morally and philosophically <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> {{agreement}} with virtually the whole of it: and not only in agreement with it, but in deeply moved agreement." [...] However, Keynes did not think Hayek's philosophy was of practical use; this was explained later in the same letter, commenting: [...] "What we need therefore, in my opinion, is not a change in our economic programmes, which would only lead in practice to disillusion {{with the results of}} your philosophy; but perhaps even the contrary, namely, an enlargement of them. Your greatest danger ahead is the probable practical failure of the application of your philosophy in the United States." ...|$|E
2500|$|Whittlesey {{worked her}} entire adult life, {{including}} when pregnant and {{after her husband}} died in 1974. She canvassed door-to-door for her 1972 legislative race while pregnant with her third child, William. In 1985, {{when looking at the}} trendline that showed that half of all pre-school children had mothers in the workforce, she assured Reagan that once the economy picked up [...] "all those women can go home and look after their own children". [...] As a long-time working mother herself, Whittlesey asserted this statement was taken out of context and did not reflect her intent of actively expanding choices, professional and personal, for women. The statement continued, [...] "They could care for their children themselves if they wished to do so because their husbands would have opportunities again in a thriving economy." [...] She emphasized Reagan's pledge to create more jobs for working people. Whittlesey was the only woman on Reagan's Senior White House Staff during her service there. According to David Broder, [...] "Whittlesey asserted in 1980 her position on women's rights and her fight as a woman to be effective politically, 'I sympathize with some of the goals of the women's movement, but they choose not to associate with me, so that's where we are. [...] <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>myself</b> <b>in</b> many closed rooms filled with men, but I'm rarely invited to women's movement's functions, because I am pro-life and do not endorse feminist ideology of victimhood.'

60|$|Mr. Carlyle {{introduced}} {{a style of}} thinking about Knox which may be called platonically Puritan.
