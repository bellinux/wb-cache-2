A total of 41 species belonging to 19 genera and 12 families have been identified. Three assemblages have been established that could be linked to environmental factors such as water depth, bottom salinities, water mass circulation and sea-ice transportation. The species-rich and abundant assemblages of the western and central Laptev Sea {{were related to the}} Atlantic waters occupying the upper continental slope. These include relatively deep-water forms that show clear affinities to North Atlantic and Arctic Ocean assemblages (Cytheropteron biconvexa, C. testudo, C. simplex, C. nodosoalatum, C. inflatum, C. porterae, Krithe glacialis, K. minima, Pseudocythere caudata, Polycope punctata, P. orbicularis). In the eastern middle shelf region, the assemblage is comprised of Acanthocythereis dunelmensis together with other normal marine species (Semicytherura complanata, Elofsonella concinna, Cluthia cluthae). This assemblage seems connected to the winter <b>flaw</b> <b>polynya</b> which {{is believed to be the}} main area of sediment entrainment into sea ice. The inner shelf assemblage of the southern Laptev Sea is dominated by shallow-water euryhaline species (Paracyprideis pseudopunctillata and Heterocyprideis sorbyana) with admixture of the brackish-water species Roundstonia macchesneyi. The unusual occurrence of a number of shallow-water ostracod species on the upper continental slope may be explained by ice-rafting which these ostracods are probably able to survive...|$|E

40|$|A {{faithful}} {{simulation of}} the sea ice drift in a coupled sea ice-ocean model {{is one of the}} key prerequisites for a reliable simulation {{of the sea}} ice, ocean and atmosphere interactions. To achieve this goal we should continue improving model physics and constructing parameterizations for relevant sub-gird processes. Also a validation of the simulations against the observational data is essential. The main aim of this work is to demonstrate the importance of the sea ice motion for the underlaying ocean. In the scope of the ongoing and anticipated Arctic climate change it has been demonstrated that the changes in the atmosphere and ocean have large impacts on the sea ice cover. At present, it is still unclear if the changes in the sea ice motion itself can also have a feedback effect on the ocean. In this work we hypothesize that a change in the sea ice motion can cause significant changes in the ocean properties and circulation. To test the hypothesis we use two sensitivity studies that help to isolate sea ice motion processes and quantify the contribution of the process to the Arctic climate system. Our main results show that the immobile landfast ice in the model simulation shifts the <b>flaw</b> <b>polynya,</b> location of strong winter sea ice and brine production away from the coast in the more saline ocean waters and more brine reaches the Arctic halocline. This strengthens the halocline that shields cold surface waters and sea ice from the warm Atlantic Water layer underneath. In addition we find that a general change in the sea ice internal strength leads to substantial changes in the ocean properties and circulation. Under weaker and more mobile sea ice Atlantic Water layer temperatures are reduced by 0. 2 K. The Eurasian basin circulation in the Atlantic Water layer is increased and this leads to the volume transports adjustments at the Arctic Straits. This effect shows that the Arctic sea ice properties and motion are not only important for the Arctic ocean, but may have consequences also for the global ocean circulation...|$|E
40|$|Arctic <b>flaw</b> <b>polynyas</b> are {{considered}} to be highly productive areas for the formation of sea-ice throughout the winter season. Most estimates of sea-ice production are based on the surface energy balance equation and use global reanalyses as atmospheric forcing, which are too coarse {{to take into account the}} impact of polynyas on the atmosphere. Additional errors in the estimates of polynya ice production may result from the methods of calculating atmospheric energy fluxes and the assumption of a thin-ice distribution within polynyas. The present study uses simulations using the mesoscale weather prediction model of the Consortium for Small-scale Modelling (COSMO), where polynya area is prescribed from satellite data. The polynya area is either assumed to be ice-free or to be covered with thin ice of 10 cm. Simulations have been performed for two winter periods (2007 / 08 and 2008 / 09). When using a realistic thin-ice thickness of 10 cm, sea-ice production in Laptev polynyas amount to 30 km 3 and 73 km 3 for the winters 2007 / 08 and 2008 / 09, respectively.

A climatology of synoptic systems is calculated for the whole Arctic. A low cyclone track density is found for eastern Siberia and the Pacific part of the Arctic. Cyclonic and anticyclonic track density decreases from the first half to {{the second half of}} the 30 -year investigation period in large parts of the Arctic. A detailed study is performed for the Laptev Sea area of the Siberian Arctic, whis is an active area for sea ice production in <b>flaw</b> <b>polynyas.</b> The reaction of the Laptev polynya system to tracks of cyclones and anticyclones is investigated by selecting favourate track directions. The Anabar-Lena Polynya is affected by cyclones moving eastwards across the Laptev Sea. These cyclones cause an opening of the polynya on the day before the cyclone passage and a closing on the day after. The West-New-Siberian Polynya (WNS) is affected by cyclone tracks moving northwards along the western flank of the Laptev Sea.

While developed to simulate large-scale sea-ice conditions, both models are analysed here in terms of polynya simulation. The main modification of both models {{in this study is}} the implementation of a landfast-ice mask. Simulated sea-ice fields from different model runs are compared with emphasis placed on the impact of this prescribed landfast-ice mask. We demonstrate that sea-ice models are not able to simulate <b>flaw</b> <b>polynyas</b> realistically when used without fast-ice description. Our investigations indicate that without landfast ice and with coarse horizontal resolution the models overestimate the fraction of open water in the polynya. This is not because a realistic polynya appears but due to a larger-scale reduction of ice concentrations and smoothed ice-concentration fields. After implementation of a landfast-ice mask, the polynya location is realistically simulated but the total open-water area is still overestimated in most cases. The study shows that the fast-ice parameterization is essential for model improvements. However, further improvements are necessary in order to progress from the simulation of large-scale features in the Arctic towards a more detailed simulation of smaller-scaled features (here polynyas) in an Arctic shelf sea...|$|R
40|$|We present {{investigations}} of Arctic polynya dynamics {{for the period}} 2002 / 2003 to 2011 / 2012. Thin ice thicknesses were calculated from MODIS ice surface temperatures, combined with ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis atmospheric data in an energy balance model. Regions of interest include the North Water Polynya, located between Ellesmere Island (Canada) and Greenland, and the Laptev Sea <b>flaw</b> <b>polynyas.</b> Based on calculated thin ice thicknesses, associated quantities like polynya area and total ice production were derived for all regarded regions and compared to recent studies using passive microwave remote sensing data. Calculated ice production reaches mean values of 223 km 3 for the North Water Polynya and 79 km 3 for the Laptev Sea. They underline {{the importance of the}} two coastal polynya systems {{in the context of the}} Arctic sea ice budget, although their individual contribution seems to be overestimated in other satellite-based studies. For both regions, obtained polynya areas and ice production clearly exceeded the corresponding values from passive microwave studies, despite a good agreement in the overall seasonal development. Possible reasons include a hidden effect of undetected clouds and the applied parametrizations in the polynya area retrieval. The application of a simple cloud coverage-correction scheme yielded reasonable adjustments for the polynya area and accumulated ice production, while open questions originating from inherent cloud effects have to be addressed in future studies. Noticeably, the sea ice cover in both regarded polynya regions shows signs of a delayed fall freeze-up over the 10 year-period...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} between polynyas and the atmospheric boundary layer is {{examined in the}} Laptev Sea using the regional, non-hydrostatic Consortium for Small-scale Modelling (COSMO) atmosphere model. A thermodynamic sea-ice model is used to consider the response of sea-ice surface temperature to idealized atmospheric forcing. The idealized regimes represent atmospheric conditions that are typical for the Laptev Sea region. Cold wintertime conditions are investigated with sea-ice ocean temperature differences of up to 40 K. The Laptev Sea <b>flaw</b> <b>polynyas</b> strongly modify the atmospheric boundary layer. Convectively mixed layers reach heights of up to 1200 m above the polynyas with temperature anomalies of more than 5 K. Horizontal transport of heat expands to areas more than 500 km downstream of the polynyas. Strong wind regimes {{lead to a more}} shallow mixed layer with strong near-surface modifications, while weaker wind regimes show a deeper, well-mixed convective boundary layer. Shallow mesoscale circulations occur in the vicinity of ice-free and thin-ice covered polynyas. They are forced by large turbulent and radiative heat fluxes from the surface of up to 789 W m- 2, strong low-level thermally induced convergence and cold air flow from the orographic structure of the Taimyr Peninsula in the western Laptev Sea region. Based on the surface energy balance we derive potential sea-ice production rates between 8 and 25 cm d- 1. These production rates are mainly determined by whether the polynyas are ice-free or covered by thin ice and by the wind strength. ...|$|R

This area is characterized by <b>flaw</b> <b>polynyas</b> which occur {{at the edge of the}} fast ice surrounding the coastal zones during wintertime. Due to large turbulent atmospheric heat fluxes, polynyas are strong sea ice producers. However, estimates of sea ice production in the Laptev Sea polynyas are arguable since high resolution and high quality atmospheric data is not available for that area. Previous estimations of ice production rely on global reanalyses as atmospheric forcing, such as NCEP with about 280 km horizontal resolution, which is too coarse to take polynyas into account. In our study, we use the limited area model COSMO with a prescribed sea ice coverage by daily AMSR-E satellite data. Runs with 15 and 5 km horizontal resolution (nested in global GME model data) are performed for the two winter periods (Nov-May) 2007 / 08 and 2008 / 09. The net energy loss of the polynya surface is used to determine ice production. COSMO is run in a forecast mode for overlapping daily 30 h runs. We use a thermodynamic sea ice module for COSMO and varied the ice thickness in the polynya area from 0 to 10 cm. This allows for a new approach for estimating the ice production in the Laptev Sea polynyas. The total polynya ice production is calculated as 51. 25 km 3 in 2007 / 08 and 126. 87 km 3 in 2008 / 09 for the assumption of ice free polynyas.

40|$|Global Change and its {{predicted}} key {{impact on}} the Arctic bring the Laptev Sea to the centre of climate-related polar research. This Shelf Sea is known as being a highly productive area {{for the formation of}} new ice throughout the winter season. A main part of the ice production occurs in <b>flaw</b> <b>polynyas</b> which appear recurrently {{at the edge of the}} fast ice surrounding the coastal zones during wintertime. This work attempts to provide a method to reliably estimate the ice production in the Laptev Sea polynyas from model result s of the numerical weather prediction model COSMO. Our modeling approach contains the use of COSMO with 15 and 5 km horizontal resolution nested in global GME/ERA-Interim data to calculate ice production in polynyas. To account for realistic polynya representation polynya area is prescribed to the COSMO model by daily AMSR-E satellite data. The potential volume ice production is calculated from atmospheric net radiation fluxes. In contrast to preceding studies our new COSMO-based method takes into account the effect of polynyas on the atmosphere. Over open water, warmer 2 m temperatures (COSMO in comparison to NCEP) lead to lower ice production. Over thin ice, surface temperature depends on air temperature and reduced air surface temperature gradients cause lower heat fluxes and less ice production than over open water. As warm-biased NCEP values are balancing the effects of our improvements the comparison of ice production retrieval based on NCEP data with our results show minor total differences only. Both methods are leading to results in same order of magnitude if the polynya is assumed to be covered with 10 cm of thin-ice. This supports the thesis that either of them leads to feasible ice production values if thin ice within the polynya is accounted for in the calculation. In case of an open water polynya, however, our study underlines the impact of the atmospheric data on the ice production. Thus we conclude that it is of major importance to choose a validated ice thickness parameterization for the model...|$|R

Algae were able to maintain relatively high rates of C fixation despite low light at the SCM, particularly in the large (> 5 µm) size fraction at open water sites. This may substantially impact biogenic C drawdown if species composition shifts in response to future climate change. Our results suggest that phytoplankton in this region are well acclimated to existing environmental conditions, including sea ice cover, low light, and nutrient pulses.

Our objective was to determine the activities and trophic relationships of planktonic microorganisms during winter. Chlorophyll a decreased during the fall and early winter as expected. In middle February, however, chlorophyll started to increase exponentially despite the low light levels. This could be attributed to small flagellates, particularly Micromonas. We determined grazing rates on these algae that were of the same order of magnitude as the in situ net decrease rates in January. This grazing was mostly due to relatively large nanoflagellates (non bacterivorous). Heterotrophic bacteria increased in numbers about a month later than the algal bloom and bacterivory by small pico and nanoflagellates followed. Thus, the first trophic chain to become active after the total darkness period was autotrophic picoflagellates (mostly Micromonas) to large nanoflagellates.

Our objective was to determine the activities and trophic relationships of planktonic microorganisms during winter. We observed that chlorophyll a decreased during the fall and early winter as expected. In middle February, however, chlorophyll started to increase exponentially despite the low light levels. This could be attributed to small flagellates, particularly Micromonas. This growth was followed by an increase in large flagellates that likely fed on these algae. Heterotrophic bacteria increased in numbers about a month later than the algal bloom and bacterivory by small pico and nanoflagellates followed. Thus, the first link of the trophic chain to become active after the total darkness period was autotrophic picoflagellates (mostly Micromonas) to large nanoflagellates.

We did 96 -hour incubations with the in situ predator-prey community and an external alive Micromonas culture (RCC 497 strain) as a tracer. The fascinating thing was that the grazing rates on Micromonas obtained were of the same order of magnitude as the in situ net death rates of the algae during December and January. This suggests that the decrease in chlorophyll a was not due to lack of light but to grazing. That is, the algae were able to subsist for a few months despite the absence of light.

Observations within the Churchill River estuary {{and away from the}} direct influence of the river plume (Button Bay), between March and May 2005, show that both sea ice (production and melt) and river water influence the region's freshwater budget. In Button Bay, ice production in the <b>flaw</b> lead or <b>polynya</b> of NW Hudson Bay result in salinization through winter until the end of March, followed by a gradual freshening of the water column through April-May. In the Churchill Estuary, conditions varied abruptly throughout winter-spring depending on the physical interaction among river discharge, the seasonal landfast ice, and the rubble zone along the seaward margin of the landfast ice. Until late May, the rubble zone partially impounded river discharge, influencing the surface salinity, stratification, flushing time, and distribution and abundance of nutrients in the estuary. The river discharge, in turn, advanced and enhanced sea ice ablation in the estuary by delivering sensible heat. Weak stratification, the supply of riverine nitrogen and silicate, and a relatively long flushing time (~ 6 days) in the period preceding melt may have briefly favoured phytoplankton production in the estuary when conditions were still poor in the surrounding coastal environment. However, in late May, the peak flow and breakdown of the ice-rubble zone around the estuary brought abrupt changes, including increased stratification and turbidity, reduced marine and freshwater nutrient supply, a shorter flushing time, and the release of the freshwater pool into the interior ocean. These conditions suppressed phytoplankton productivity while enhancing the inventory of particulate organic matter delivered by the river.

[...] 27 pages, 12 figures, 7 tablesMajor {{pathways}} of {{biogenic carbon}} (C) flow are resolved for the planktonic food web of the <b>flaw</b> lead <b>polynya</b> {{system of the}} Amundsen Gulf (southeast Beaufort Sea, Arctic Ocean) in spring-summer 2008. This period was relevant to study the effect of climate change on Arctic marine ecosystems as it was characterized by unusually low ice cover and warm sea surface temperature. Our synthesis relied on a mass balance estimate of gross primary production (GPP) of 52. 5 ± 12. 5 g C m− 2 calculated using the drawdown of nitrate and dissolved inorganic C, and a seasonal f-ratio of 0. 64. Based on chlorophyll a biomass, we estimated that GPP was dominated by phytoplankton (93. 6 %) over ice algae (6. 4 %) and by large cells (> 5 μm, 67. 6 %) over small cells (< 5 μm, 32. 4 %). Ancillary in situ data on bacterial production, zooplankton biomass and respiration, herbivory, bacterivory, vertical particle fluxes, pools of particulate and dissolved organic carbon (POC, DOC), net community production (NCP), as well as selected variables from the literature were {{used to evaluate the}} fate of size-fractionated GPP in the ecosystem. The structure and functioning of the planktonic food web was elucidated through inverse analysis using the mean GPP and the 95 % confidence limits of every other field measurement as lower and upper constraints. The model computed a net primary production of 49. 2 g C m− 2, which was directly channeled toward dominant calanoid copepods (i. e. Calanus hyperboreus 20 %, Calanus glacialis 10 %, and Metridia longa 10 %), other mesozooplankton (12 %), microzooplankton (14 %), detrital POC (18 %), and DOC (16 %). Bacteria required 29. 9 g C m− 2, a demand met entirely by the DOC derived from local biological activities. The ultimate C outflow comprised respiration fluxes (82 % of the initial GPP), a small sedimentation (3 %), and a modest residual C flow (15 %) resulting from NCP, dilution and accumulation. The sinking C flux at the model limit depth (395 m) supplied 60 % of the estimated benthic C demand (2. 8 g C m− 2), suggesting that the benthos relied partly on other C sources within the bottom boundary layer to fuel its activity. In summary, our results illustrate that the ongoing decline in Arctic sea ice promotes the growth of pelagic communities in the Amundsen Gulf, which benefited from a ∼ 80 % increase in GPP in spring-summer 2008 when compared to 2004 – a year of average ice conditions and relatively low GPP. However, 53 % of the secondary production was generated within the microbial food web, the net ecological efficiency of zooplankton populations was not particularly high (13. 4 %), and the quantity of biogenic C available for trophic export remained low (6. 6 g C m− 2). Hence {{it is unlikely that the}} increase in lower food web productivity, such as the one observed in our study, could support new harvestable fishery resources in the offshore Beaufort Sea domainThe CFL system study is a project of the International Polar Year 2007 – 2008 funded by the Government of Canada (IPY # 96).
