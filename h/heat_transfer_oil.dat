However, a maximum of 82 % thermal conductivity enhancement is observed for Fe 3 O 4 /Kerosene magneto nanocolloid for the same concentration but relatively at low magnetic field (600 G). Thereby, a strong effect of fluid as well as particle physical properties on the chain formation propensity, leading to enhanced conduction, in such systems is observed. Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles show insignificant effect on the thermal conductivity enhancement of MNCs due to their minimal magnetic moment. An analytical approach has been proposed to understand the mechanism and physics behind the thermal conductivity enhancement under external applied magnetic field, in tune with near field magnetostatic interactions as well as Neel relaxivity of the magnetic nanoparticles. Furthermore, the analytical model is able to predict the phenomenon of enhanced thermal conductivity as a function of physical parameters such as chain length, size and types of nanoparticles, fluid characteristics, magnetic field intensity, saturation magnetic moment, nanoparticle concentration etc. and good agreement with the experimental results has been observed.

40|$|Solar thermal-to-electric {{power plants}} have been tested and {{investigated}} at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) since the late 1970 s, and thermal storage {{has always been an}} area of key study because it affords an economical method of delivering solar-electricity during non-daylight hours. This paper describes the design considerations of a new, single-tank, thermal storage system and details the benefits of employing this technology in large-scale (10 MW to 100 MW) solar thermal power plants. Since December 1999, solar engineers at Sandia National Laboratories' National Solar Thermal Test Facility (NSTTF) have designed and are constructing a thermal storage test called the thermocline system. This technology, which employs a single thermocline tank, has the potential to replace the traditional and more expensive two-tank storage systems. The thermocline tank approach uses a mixture of silica sand and quartzite rock to displace {{a significant portion of the}} volume in the tank. Then it is filled with the <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> fluid, a molten nitrate salt. A thermal gradient separates the hot and cold salt. Loading the tank with the combination of sand, rock, and molten salt instead of just molten salt dramatically reduces the system cost. The typical cost of the molten nitrate salt is $ 800 per ton versus the cost of the sand and rock portion at $ 70 per ton. Construction of the thermocline system will be completed in August 2000, and testing will run for two to three months. The testing results will be used to determine the economic viability of the single-tank (thermocline) storage technology for large-scale solar thermal power plants. Also discussed in this paper are the safety issues involving molten nitrate salts and other <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> fluids, such as synthetic <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>oils,</b> and the impact of these issues on the system design...|$|R

40|$|The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) is {{developing}} a novel process to produce titanium metal {{at a lower cost}} than the current Kroll process used commercially. The technology initiated by the CSIR will benefit South Africa in achieving the long-term goal of establishing a competitive titanium metal industry. A bubble column reactor is one of the suitable reactors that were considered for the production of titanium metal. This reactor will be operated with a molten salt medium. Bubble columns are widely used in various fields of process engineering, such as oxidation, hydrogenation, fermentation, Fischer–Tropsch synthesis and waste water treatment. The advantages of these reactors over other multiphase reactors are simple construction, good mass and heat transfer, absence of moving parts and low operating costs. High heat transfer is important in reactors when high thermal duties are required. An appropriate measurement of the heat transfer coefficient is of primary importance for designing reactors that are highly exothermic or endothermic. An experimental test facility to measure wall heat transfer coefficients was constructed and operated. The experimental setup was operated with tap water, <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>oil</b> 32 and lithium chloride–potassium chloride (LiCl–KCl) eutectic by bubbling argon gas through the liquids. The column was operated at a temperature of 40 oC for the water experiments, at 75, 103 and 170 oC for the <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>oil</b> experiments, and at 450 oC for the molten salt experiments. All the experiments were run at superficial gas velocities in the range of 0. 006 to 0. 05 m/s. Three heating tapes, each connected to a corresponding variable AC voltage controller, were used to heat the column media. Heat transfer coefficients were determined by inducing a known heat flux through the column wall and measuring the temperature difference between the wall and the reactor contents. In order to balance the system, heat was removed by cooling water flowing through a copper tube {{on the inside of the}} column. Temperature differences between the column wall and the liquid were measured at five axial locations. A mechanistic model for estimating the kinematic turbulent viscosity and dispersion coefficient was developed from a mechanism of momentum exchange between large circulation cells. By analogy between heat and momentum transfer, these circulation cells also transfer heat from the wall to the liquid. There were some challenges when operating the bubble column with molten salt due to leakages on the welds and aggressive corrosion of the column. The experimental results were obtained when operating the column with water and <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>oil.</b> It was found that the heat transfer coefficient increases with superficial gas velocity. The values of the heat transfer coefficient for the argon–water system were higher than those for the argon–heat transfer oil system. The heat transfer coefficients were also found to increase with an increase in temperature. Gas holdup increased with the superficial gas velocity. It was found that the estimated axial dispersion coefficients are within the range of those reported in the literature and the ratios of dispersion coefficients are in agreement with those in the literature. The estimated kinematic turbulent viscosities were comparable with those in the literature. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2015. tm 2015 Chemical EngineeringMEngUnrestricte...|$|E

Heat was added to the ammonia-water through a thin wall, above which flowed <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>oil</b> in a separate branching fractal-like microchannel array. Such arrays have been shown to utilize the increased heat transfer coefficients seen in parallel channel arrays; however, they do so with a lower pressure drop. An experimental flow loop consisting of ammonia-water and <b>heat</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>oil</b> sub-loops was instrumented along with a test manifold for global measurements to be taken. Temperature, pressure, density and mass flow rate measurements permitted calculation of desorption and heat transfer characteristics. Parameters included oil mass flow rate, oil inlet temperature, and strong solution flow rate, while strong solution concentration, temperature, and weak solution pressure were kept constant. The desorber was assumed to achieve equilibrium conditions between the vapor and weak solution in the separation chamber. The exit plenum was large and acted as a flash chamber, making the assumption reasonable. The vapor mass fraction was determined from knowledge of the weak solution saturation temperature. Heat exchanger analyses (LMTD and ε-NTU) were done to determine the heat transfer characteristics of the desorber. Calculated values of UA are shown to be as high as 5. 0 W/K, and desorber heat duties were measured as high as 334 W.
