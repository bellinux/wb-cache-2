I pass over my troubles with the Customs, if such they could be called. Suffice {{it to say that}} ultimately I succeeded in landing my goods, on which the <b>duty</b> <b>chargeable</b> was apparently enormous. This I did by distributing twenty-five English sovereigns among various officials, beginning with the acting-governor and ending with a drunken black sweep who sat in a kind of sentry box on the quay.|$|R

Sir Robert Peel had imposed 1s. per gallon on Irish spirits in 1842, but was defeated by the smuggler, and repealed the duty in consequence of the failure. In 1842 the duty was levied by a separate revenue police. I abolished this separate police, and handed the duty to the constabulary force, which raised it, and without difficulty.|$|R
