500|$|On July 29, 1966, Dylan crashed his Triumph {{motorcycle}} {{near his}} home in Woodstock, New York, suffering cracked vertebrae and a mild concussion. The concerts he was scheduled to perform had to be cancelled. Biographer Clinton Heylin wrote in 1990 on the significance of the crash: [...] "A quarter of a century on, Dylan's motorcycle accident is still viewed as the pivot of his career. As a sudden, abrupt moment when his wheel really did explode. The great irony is that 1967—the year after the accident—remains his most prolific year as a songwriter." [...] In a 1969 Rolling Stone interview with Jann Wenner, Dylan said, [...] "I had a dreadful motorcycle accident which put me away for a while, and I still didn't sense the importance of that accident till at least a year after that. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a real accident. I mean I thought that I was just gonna get up and go back to doing what I was doing before ... but I couldn't do it anymore." ...|$|E
2500|$|Herzog's {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Aguirre was actor Klaus Kinski. The two had met many years earlier when the then-struggling young actor rented a room in Herzog’s family apartment, and Kinski’s often terrifying and {{deranged}} antics during the three months he lived there left a lasting impression on the director. Years later, Herzog remembered the volatile actor and knew that he was the only possible man who could play the mad Aguirre, and he sent Kinski a copy of the screenplay. [...] "Between three and four in the morning, the phone rang," [...] Herzog recalled. [...] "It took me {{at least a couple of}} minutes before <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was Kinski who was the source of this inarticulate screaming. And after an hour of this, it dawned on me that he found it the most fascinating screenplay and wanted to be Aguirre." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some of the diary's {{passages}} are unflinching in {{exposing the}} behavior at the imperial court, particularly that of drunken courtiers who seduced the ladies-in-waiting. As Keene describes it, {{the court was}} a place where the courtiers were [...] "drunken men who make obscene jokes and paw at women". Murasaki complained about drunk courtiers and princes who behaved badly, such as the incident when at a banquet court poet Fujiwara no Kintō joined a group of women asking whether Murasaki was present– alluding to the character in The Tale of Genji. Murasaki retorted that none of the novel's characters lived at this tawdry and unpleasant court, so unlike the court in her novel. She left the banquet when [...] "Counsellor Takai... started pulling at Lady Hyōbu's robes and singing dreadful songs, but His Excellency said nothing. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was bound to be a terribly drunken affair this evening, so... Lady Saishō and I decided to retire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I do care. But <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> isn't fair to {{be major}} all the time. I'm willing {{to step down}} and give the other fellows a show." ...|$|R
6000|$|I journey home: {{the pattern}} grows [...] Of moonshades on the way: [...] "Soon the first quarter, I suppose," [...] Sky-glancing {{travellers}} say; <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it,</b> for those, [...] Has been a common day.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{there is}} nothing to do but to {{investigate}} this as far as we can. Of course, <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would cut you to have everybody in the school know of your sleep-walking habit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did--for {{a minute}} or two," [...] Frank confessed with an embarrassed smile. [...] "Then, of course, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was impossible." ...|$|E
60|$|It was Mary! She had returned. The thongs {{no longer}} hurt me. The pangs of hunger and thirst disappeared. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had been {{loneliness}} from which I suffered most.|$|E
60|$|As my machine sank {{among them}} <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was fight or die, with good chances of dying in any event, and so I struck {{the ground with}} drawn long-sword ready to defend myself as I could.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{see that}} I {{can do nothing}} by {{ordinary}} methods. <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is useless to make a public outcry. There is only my own conviction that Margaret came to a violent end, and I cannot expect anyone to pay heed to that.' ...|$|R
500|$|... "I don't like {{violence}}. I never condone hitting anyone, and I {{never thought}} that any violence should have taken place. But on the other hand, I understood Sean's anger and believe me, I have wanted to hit them [...] many times. I never would, you know, because <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would just make things worse." ...|$|R
5000|$|In Starbucks The Way I See It No 233 {{she said}} [...] "I {{used to think}} that going to the jungle made my life an adventure. However, after years of unusual work in exotic places, <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is not how far off I go, or how deep into the forest I walk that gives my life meaning. I see that living life fully is what makes life - anyone’s life, no matter where they do or do not go - an adventure." ...|$|R
60|$|With the {{approach}} of night <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was necessary to make arrangements for the girl's comfort. With {{the aid of a}} couple of upright poles I stretched a grey blanket across the raft so as to make a complete partition.|$|E
6000|$|... "One moment, sir," [...] I said, as <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a pink bald head, {{and not a}} red face, {{which was}} {{fronting}} me. [...] "I am not very clear yet why I am to interview this gentleman. What has he done?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fred Arnold {{was in the}} {{battalion}} and I felt dreadfully about him, for <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was because of {{me that he was}} going away with such a sorrowful expression. I couldn't help it but I felt as badly as if I could.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, not at all. <b>I</b> merely <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was possible, {{from your}} story, for Monsieur Lawrence {{to go to}} the poison cupboard. The {{possibility}} had to be confirmed, or eliminated." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{now that}} I've {{captured}} the creature, I don't {{know what to}} do with her," [...] went on Mister Woodchuck; [...] "although I believe, of course, she should be punished in some way, and made to feel as unhappy as her people have made us feel. Yet <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> a dreadful thing to hurt any living creature, and as far as I'm concerned I'm quite willing to forgive her." [...] With these words he wiped his face with a red silk handkerchief, as if really distressed.|$|R
60|$|Yes, man is strangely and wonderfully made. Now that I coolly {{consider}} the matter, <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was {{essentially the same}} spirit with which I enjoyed beating up Tom Spink, that I {{have in the past}} enjoyed contests of the mind in which I have out-epigrammed clever opponents. In the one case, one proves himself top-dog of the mind; in the other, top-dog of the muscle. Whistler and Wilde were just as much intellectual bullies as I was a physical bully yesterday morning when I punched Tom Spink into lying down and staying down.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she desolately asserted, [...] "that is so! Something {{has been}} hanging over me {{ever since we}} came, and {{suddenly}} <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was {{the absence of the}} brides. But--but--down at the hotels--Didn't you see anything bridal there? When the omnibuses arrived, was there no burst of minstrelsy? Was there--" ...|$|E
60|$|So great was my fear as to {{what the}} future might have in store for us that I had failed to hear the hum of voices, until my {{attention}} was thus attracted, and then <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was yet quite early in the evening, instead of well toward morning, as I had supposed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Naturally not, monsieur," [...] I cried, {{somewhat}} heated by {{this seemingly}} studied ignoring of important facts, [...] "because <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was Monsieur de Castelroux's mission to arrest {{and not to}} judge me. Monsieur de Castelroux was an officer, not a Tribunal, and to have denied this or that to him {{would have been so}} much waste of breath." ...|$|E
40|$|As I {{consider}} {{what it is}} I most want to say in this brief essay, <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is almost February and, essay marking aside, the winter term of teaching {{has come to an}} end. Already, after only four months in Tokyo, it is with some difficulty that I recall the first impressions of a stranger in a strange land; but the sense of achievement when I negotiated my way in, through and out of Shibuya station on my own is still palpable (and faintly ridiculous – I am after all a fully grown adult) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Always have I {{been taught}} differently," [...] replied Ghek; [...] "but since I have known {{this woman and}} you, of another race, I {{have come to believe}} that there may be other {{standards}} fully as high and desirable as those of the kaldanes. At least I have had a glimpse of the thing you call happiness and <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> may be good even though I have no means of expressing it. I cannot laugh nor smile, and yet within me is a sense of contentment when this woman sings--a sense that seems to open before me wondrous vistas of beauty and unguessed pleasure that far transcend the cold joys of a perfectly functioning brain. I would that I had been born of thy race." ...|$|R
60|$|HYPATIA. No it wouldnt. If you all sat in silence, as if {{you were}} waiting for {{something}} to happen, then there would be hope even if nothing did happen. But this eternal cackle, cackle, cackle about things in general is only fit for old, old, OLD people. I suppose it means something to them: theyve had their fling. All I listen for is some sign of it ending in something; but just when it seems to be coming to a point, Johnny or papa just starts another hare; and it all begins over again; and <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> never going to lead anywhere and never going to stop. Thats when I want to scream. I wonder how you can stand it.|$|R
60|$|The {{photograph}} was certainly very off-colored. An unkind critic might easily have misinterpreted that dim surface. It was a dull gray landscape, and as I gradually deciphered {{the details of}} it <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> represented a long and enormously high line of cliffs exactly like an immense cataract seen in the distance, with a sloping, tree-clad plain in the foreground.|$|E
60|$|I was come by {{then to the}} Garonne. I drew rein {{beside the}} swiftly flowing stream, winding itself like a flood of {{glittering}} silver between the black shadows of its banks. A little while I sat there listening, and surveying the stately, turreted chateau that loomed, a grey, noble pile, beyond the water. I speculated what demesne this might be, and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was probably Lavedan.|$|E
60|$|My Riz Diane duly arrived, but was served, I noticed, by a {{different}} waiter. It looked very tempting, and it was indeed a dish of which I was particularly fond, but <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had been specially ordered by Louis, and with a sigh I pushed it on one side. I finished my luncheon with rolls and butter, and took care to procure my coffee before Louis returned.|$|E
500|$|In March 2006, Liukin placed {{first in}} the {{all-around}} at the American Cup. At the 2006 Pacific Alliance Championships, Liukin tied with teammate Memmel for {{first in the}} all-around, won the uneven bars title and a silver medal on beam, {{and contributed to the}} U.S. team's gold-medal performance. She competed at the 2006 U.S. Classic as the defending all-around champion, but falls on the uneven bars and floor resulted in a fourth-place finish. However, she scored extremely well on the balance beam and was the only competitor in the meet, junior or senior, to earn a score over 16.00 on this event. After that when she was interviewed on ABC television show Dancing with the stars, she said,"After <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> not all about winning. It's about the journey." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{know not}} whether I shall be understood, but <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is finally from what I learn'd {{personally}} mixing in such scenes that I am now penning these pages. One {{night in the}} gloomiest period of the war, in the Patent-office hospital in Washington city, as I stood by the bedside of a Pennsylvania soldier, who lay, conscious of quick approaching death, yet perfectly calm, and with noble, spiritual manner, the veteran surgeon, turning aside, said to me, that though he had witness'd many, many deaths of soldiers, and had been a worker at Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, &c., {{he had not seen}} yet the first case of man or boy that met the approach of dissolution with cowardly qualms or terror. My own observation fully bears out the remark.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have tried}} to tell {{nothing but the truth}} about myself. But <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> cannot be the whole truth. For while so engaged (just as when one peers into a looking-glass in the moonlight) a {{something}} has at times looked out of some secret den or niche in me, and then has vanished. Supposing, then, my dear Sir W., my story convinces you that all these years you have unawares been harbouring in your friendship not a woman, scarcely a human being, but an ASP! Oh dear, and oh dear! Well, there are three and-thirty ingredients (ingrediments as I used to call them, when I was a child) in that sovran antidote, Venice Treacle. Scatter a pennyweight of it upon my tombstone; and so lay my in-fi-ni-te-si-mal ap-pa-ri-ti-on! ...|$|R
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{was more}} than {{possible}} we might never come out from beneath these timbers alive because of having been killed by our own friends. The triumph which had been mine was sadly marred by the timorousness which came over me, as I understood that death might be nearer at hand than {{when we were in}} old Mary's cabin, with Abel Hunt roaming around the village in search of us.|$|E
60|$|I {{sat up in}} bed, heavy, unrefreshed, {{and with}} a {{splitting}} headache. The clock on the mantelpiece was striking three o'clock; from below I could hear the clatter of vehicles in the courtyard, and the distant roar of traffic from the streets beyond. Slowly <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was {{three o'clock in the}} afternoon; the events of the night before re-formed themselves in my mind. I rang the bell for the valet and sprang out of bed.|$|E
60|$|General Ward {{had issued}} orders that the lads be {{committed}} to the earth with all the ceremony of a military funeral, and we Minute Boys {{who were able to}} march, acted as guard of honor. It was all very imposing; {{but at the same time}} solemn, and my heart grew chill with fear as to the future, when <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was more than probable others of our company would give up their lives before we had won out in this fight against the king.|$|E
30|$|This {{is exactly}} the point where <b>I</b> {{suddenly}} <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is sort of not quite fitting how I was using those symbols previously.

2500|$|After touring {{for nearly}} two years, the Wallflowers took a short break before {{returning}} to the studio to record their third album, (Breach). [...] Dylan approached the songwriting process differently this time than he had for the Wallflowers' two previous albums, explaining that he didn't want to avoid the subject of his personal life, as he had done in the past: [...] "(Breach) was the first record <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> necessary and <b>I</b> have a right to write about anything that I want to write about. [...] I'm not going to dance around these subjects anymore [...] [...] [...] I don't have any interest in writing songs that are defensive or that address anything that don't come naturally to me but <b>I</b> also <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> needed to stop this nonsense of pretending that hiding any of this information counts to anybody; it just doesn't really matter anymore." ...|$|R
40|$|Becoming a {{university}} {{president is a}} fairly risky thing to do. At least at various moments I'm very convinced of that. As I was putting together my thoughts for this speech, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that,</b> in agreeing to give the keynote address I was embarking on a fairly dangerous course. First of all, because I have not even been through a full promotion and tenure cycle at this university. Although I {{know a lot of}} the history (because many of you have shared a lot of the stories with me), I would not purport to fully understand scholarship and faculty load at CSUN. That's another element of danger in talking about this topic with you today. Also, <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a little dangerous to talk about this with all of you, because there are certainly many of you in the audience who are still being evaluated using our current promotion and tenure standards...|$|R
