40|$|A {{test area}} close to Philadelphia, USA, has been flown with an UltraCamX from the extreme low flying {{elevation}} of 310 m above ground. This leads to images with 22 mm ground sampling distance (GSD). The required <b>end</b> <b>lap</b> of 60 % corresponds just to 84 m. The imaging {{sequence of the}} UltraCamX with 1. 6 sec enables with the minimal flying speed of 220 km/hour only a base of 98 m, by this reason each flight line was flown twice {{in the same direction}} at 20 % <b>end</b> <b>lap.</b> In this way combining the 2 flights per strip a 60 % <b>end</b> <b>lap</b> was achieved. The area is covered also at 60 % lateral overlap. 44 targeted ground control points {{with a standard deviation of}} the coordinate components of 1. 5 cm and better are available in the 210 used images. An automatic aerial triangulation with LPS has been made. Detailed analysis with the Hannover program for bundle block adjustment BLUH showed systematic image errors requiring an improvement of the UltraCam-specific additional parameters. Finally by bundle adjustment with self calibration a standard deviation of the horizontal check point coordinates of approximately 14 mm corresponding to 0. 6 GSD and in Z up to 26 mm corresponding to 1. 2 GSD has been reached for the check points measured in the average in 6 images. This extreme accuracy is limited by the identification and the accuracy of the ground control and check points. The TDI was able to compensate the very fast forward motion; no obvious reduced image quality in flight direction could be seen. Radiometric image quality for these high resolution images were also conducted by assessing the image quality in terms of edge analysis. This allows the determination of the effective resolution for the panchromatic and the pan-sharpened images. 1...|$|E
50|$|A further day's {{recuperation}} {{continued to}} aid Anstey {{prior to the}} Senior TT. Following a delayed start due to poor visibility, Anstey was lying in 4th place by the <b>end</b> of <b>lap</b> 1 having lapped at an average speed of 131.086 mi/h km/h. With the retirement of Peter Hickman, Anstey moved up to 3rd place at the pit stop at the <b>end</b> of <b>lap</b> 2, until he was displaced by John McGuinness at the <b>end</b> of <b>lap</b> 3. Anstey was then overtaken on corrected time by Dean Harrison following {{the second round of}} pit stops at the <b>end</b> of <b>lap</b> 4, holding 5th place {{until the end of the}} 6 laps.|$|R
50|$|By {{this stage}} Schumacher was 15 seconds {{further down the}} road, until he swept into the pits at the <b>end</b> of <b>lap</b> 37. Coulthard drove aggressively to try to cut {{down some of the}} advantage. Schumacher was {{underway}} in 10.7 seconds and rejoined behind Barrichello, some 15 seconds behind Coulthard.Barrichello was in at the <b>end</b> of <b>lap</b> 39 for his stop. Traffic, a full fuel load and the cold tires on Schumacher's Ferrari saw Coulthard's lead open to 18.1 seconds before he came in for his stop at the <b>end</b> of <b>lap</b> 41. He had done enough to keep ahead of Barrichello.|$|R
50|$|Räikkönen {{made his}} second stop {{of the race}} at the <b>end</b> of <b>lap</b> twenty nine, rejoining in {{eleventh}} place, behind Webber. On lap thirty one, he moved past Webber, and into tenth place, behind David Coulthard. One lap later, the McLarens swapped positions, as Räikkönen moved into ninth. However, Räikkönen had to make yet another pit stop at the <b>end</b> of <b>lap</b> thirty four due to an electronics problem on his car. The stop lasted fifteen seconds and he rejoined last. Montoya made his first pit stop at the <b>end</b> of <b>lap</b> thirty five, rejoining in sixth.|$|R
40|$|Due {{to legal}} restrictions, the German hard coal mining company Deutsche Steinkohle AG (DSK) {{is obliged to}} conduct a {{monitoring}} on surface changes (subsidence) caused by mining activity (e. g. topographic surface, groundwater, water, flora and fauna, soil). To fulfill legal demands and to do this effectively, process chains by use of Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Geo Information Systems (GIS) have been established. Photogrammetric methods are used to generate high resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEM) from which in combination with subsidence data geometric changes at the topographic surface are deduced. For mine site areas from about 100 km to 200 km DEMs have to be handled on digital photogrammetric stereo workstations with a height standard deviation of ± 10 cm. This accuracy up to now could be obtained with analogue wide angle cameras at an image scale of 1 : 4000 and 80 % <b>end</b> <b>lap</b> together with {{a high number of}} ground control points (GCP). More and more digital aerial frame cameras like Intergraph DMC and Vexcel UltraCamD are available for mapping application. DSK decided to order photo flights with the Vexcel UltraCamD because only this camera is able to take images at 80 % <b>end</b> <b>lap</b> with a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 10 cm. A vertical accuracy of about ± 8 to 9 cm should be reached. Since 2004 three digital photo flights have been made for DSK with the same camera, no. 8. In December 2004 for the stereo plotting of a site plan for a coking plant, in August 2005 a test flight covering 20 km has been made to evaluate the potential of color-infrared images for environmental monitoring purposes and in March 200...|$|E
40|$|In this {{contribution}} {{the geometric}} {{characteristics of a}} digital photogrammetric aerial camera are discussed for the generation of digital elevation models (DEM) and stereo plotting. Due to legal restrictions the German hard coal mining company RAG Aktiengesellschaft (RAG), successor of the Deutsche Steinkohle AG, is obliged to conduct a monitoring on earth surface changes caused by mining activity. To fulfil legal demands in effective manner process chains using photogrammetry, remote sensing and Geo Information Systems (GIS) have been established. Photogrammetric methods are used to generate high resolution DEMs from which- in combination with subsidence information- geometric changes to the topographic surface are deduced.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for dense point cloud matching and aero triangulation {{based on the}} well-known scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) technique. The modern digital cameras can take high resolution aerial images with high <b>end</b> <b>lap</b> between contiguous images in a strip and, if needed, also with high side lap between images on neighboring strips. Therefore, automation on image matching for generation of high density of 3 D object points becomes applicable. A new method is thus developed to perform the processing. Moreover, it can do an aero triangulation and automatic tie point measurement without the need on the input data such as block and strip data for providing image overlap information. In order to increase {{the effectiveness of the}} method for simultaneously processing a large number of aerial images with large image format in a block area, both schemes of Quality Filtering (QF) and Affine Transformation Prediction (AFTP) are proposed for automatic tie point extraction and measurement with a better and satisfactory efficiency. Tests are done by using aerial images taken with the RMK DX camera in Taiwan. Also, high precision ground check points are adopted to evaluate the quality of the results. They show that a high density of 3 D object points are extracted and determined. Furthermore, the automatic tie point selection and measurement is done efficiently even under the circumstance that no priori-knowledge on image overlap is available. Also, ground check points show that the accuracy of photo coordinates is 0. 21 pixels, namely it reaches a subpixel level...|$|E

40|$|Z/I Imaging {{introduced}} {{with the}} DMC II 140, 230 and 250 digital aerial cameras {{with a very}} large format CCD for the panchromatic channel. The CCDs have with 140 / 230 / 250 mega pixel a size not available in photogrammetry before. CCDs in general {{have a very high}} relative accuracy, but the overall geometry has to be checked as well as the influence of not flat CCDs. A CCD with a size of 96 mm x 82 mm must have a flatness or knowledge of flatness in the range of 1 mu m if the camera accuracy in the range of 1. 3 mu m shall not be influenced. The DMC II cameras have been evaluated with three different flying heights leading to 5 cm, 9 cm and 15 cm or 20 cm GSD, crossing flight lines and 60 % side lap. The optimal test conditions guaranteed the precise determination of the object coordinates as well as the systematic image errors. All three camera types show only very small systematic image errors, ranging in the root mean square between 0. 12 mu m up to 0. 3 mu m with extreme values not exceeding 1. 6 mu m. The remaining systematic image errors, determined by analysis of the image residuals and not covered by the additional parameters, are negligible. A standard deviation of the object point heights below the GSD, determined at independent check points, even in blocks with just 20 % side lap and 60 % <b>end</b> <b>lap</b> is standard. Corresponding to the excellent image geometry the object point coordinates are only slightly influenced by the self calibration. For all DMCII types the handling of image models for data acquisition must not be supported by an improvement of the image coordinates by the determined systematic image errors. Such an improvement up to now is not standard for photogrammetric software packages. The advantage of a single monolithic CCD is obvious. An edge analysis of pan-sharpened DMC II 250 images resulted in factors for the effective resolution below 1. 0. The result below 1. 0 is only possible by contrast enhancement, but this requires with low image noise, demonstrating the very good radiometric image quality...|$|E
