According to FAA (Federal American Aviation) regulations, aircraft {{should be able}} to land safely following specified types of bird impact on components such as radomes, windshields, engines leading edge structures and other <b>exposed</b> <b>components.</b> Thus <b>exposed</b> <b>components</b> are required to be certified for bird impact. In order to evaluate whether the aircraft is compliant to FAA requirements, several experimental tests and numerical simulations of bird impact on components need to be preformed. This paper presents an experimental and numerical investigation of bird impact on radome, a structural waterproof component that protects the radar system in aircraft and also nearby personnel from being accidentally struck by rotating antennas. In aircraft, randome structure {{is one of the most}} exposed component for bird impact. In this paper, numerical simulation of bird impact on radome component is considered, using new development of multi-material formulation and fluid structure interaction developed in LSDYNA.

Besides physical and chemical sputtering processes, high heat quasi-stationary fluxes during normal and intense thermal transients are of serious concern for the engineers who develop reliable wall components. In addition, the material and component degradation due to intense fluxes of energetic neutrons is another critical issue in D-T-burning fusion devices which requires extensive R&D.

40|$|In {{a period}} where the {{evolution}} of the space environment is causing increasing concerns for the future of space exploitation and sustainability, the design-for-demise philosophy has gained an increased interest. However, building a spacecraft such that most of it will demise through design-for-demise strategies may lead to designs that are more vulnerable to space debris impacts, thus compromising the reliability of the mission. Demisable designs will tend to favour lighter materials, thinner structures, and more <b>exposed</b> <b>components,</b> whereas survivability oriented designs will favour denser materials, thicker structures, and more protected components. Given the competing nature of the demisability and the survivability, we developed a multi-objective optimisation framework to evaluate the effect of preliminary design choices on the survivability and demisability of spacecraft components since {{the early stages of the}} mission design. Such method is applied to the representative test case of tank assemblies of Earth observation and remote sensing missions...|$|E

5000|$|CLC {{was first}} studied as way to produce [...] from fossil fuels, using two {{interconnected}} fluidized beds. Later it was proposed {{as a system}} for increasing power station efficiency. The gain in efficiency is possible due to the enhanced reversibility of the two redox reactions; in traditional single stage combustion, {{the release of a}} fuelâs energy occurs in a highly irreversible manner - departing considerably from equilibrium. In CLC, if an appropriate oxygen carrier is chosen, both redox reactions can be made to occur almost reversibly and at relatively low temperatures. Theoretically, this allows a power station using CLC to approach the ideal work output for an internal combustion engine without <b>exposing</b> <b>components</b> to excessive working temperatures.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{investigators}} {{have demonstrated that}} a sialic acid residue {{is added to the}} terminal galactose moiety of gonococcal lipooligosaccharide (LOS) when incubated with 5 '-CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid. When this in vitro sialylation occurs, gonococci become resistant to the bactericidal activity of normal human serum. This is believed to result because the added sialic acid residue blocks the binding of bactericidal anti-LOS antibodies present in normal human serum. We extend these studies by demonstrating that sialylated gonococci also become resistant to the bactericidal effect of immune sera containing antibodies that recognize <b>exposed</b> <b>components</b> of the outer membrane besides LOS. Prevention of antibody binding to the organism was not the cause, since the same percentage of bactericidal antibodies to the major outer membrane protein, Protein I, can be absorbed with sialylated organisms as with wild-type organisms. In addition, gonococcal sialylation prevents opsonophagocytosis by antigonococcal antisera. The negative effect of sialic acid on the complement pathway might be the reason for the findings in this study...|$|E

40|$|The concept, design, and {{features}} are described of a lightweight, high strength, modular robot manipulator being developed for space and commercial applications. The manipulator has seven fully active {{degrees of freedom}} and is fully operational in 1 G. Each of the seven joints incorporates a unique drivetrain design which provides zero backlash operation, is insensitive to wear, and is single fault tolerant to motor or servo amplifier failure. Feedback sensors provide position, velocity, torque, and motor winding temperature information at each joint. This sensing system is also designed to be single fault tolerant. The manipulator consists of five modules (not including gripper). These modules join via simple quick-disconnect couplings and self-mating connectors which allow rapid assembly and/or disassembly for reconfiguration, transport, or servicing. The manipulator is a completely enclosed assembly, with no <b>exposed</b> <b>components</b> or wires.

However it is often unclear how the results of these analyses can help to generate new solutions and thus be truly beneficial for innovation in sustainable architectural design. Recent developments in open source applications that allow links between energy simulation engines and 3 D modeling environments open a new layer of understanding. The possibility to better understand the dynamic interaction between incident solar radiation and building envelopes allows the synthesis of new architectural design-schemes. This paper presents the results of a series of experiments based on the case-study of a mid-latitude single-family house in Taiki-Cho, Japan. The first experiment describes how the incident solar energy interacts with the <b>exposed</b> <b>components</b> of the envelope. The second experiment describes how the energy demand of the building can be partially reduced through the design of passive interventions that are based on the dynamics of the demand.

Three main features were observed: a) Although platelets form a pavement on the <b>exposed</b> <b>components</b> of the aortic intima, platelet thrombi do not {{form on the}} denuded surface. b) During the first weeks after injury, a temporary false endothelial lining is formed by modified intimal smooth muscle cells. While the modified smooth muscle cells do not constitute a continuous cell layer, they are like true endothelial cells in that platelets do not adhere to the cell membrane of either cell type. c) A continuous layer of true endothelial cells is formed within 2 months after the original injury. Even after reestablishment of a continuous endothelium, however, abnormalities persist {{in the form of}} incompletely formed intercellular junctions. This abnormal endothelium is associated with areas of intimal smooth muscle cell proliferation. These observations are compatible with two alternative interpretations of the role of endothelial injury in the intimal proliferation seen following injury to the vessel wall: a) persistent defects in the endothelium may result in proliferation of underlying arterial smooth muscle cells or b) the proliferation, in converse, may in some manner delay the healing process of the overlying endothelium...|$|E

40|$|Android apps could <b>expose</b> their <b>components</b> for cooperat-ing {{with other}} apps. This convenience, however, makes apps {{susceptible}} to the <b>exposed</b> <b>component</b> vulnerability (ECV), in which a dangerous API (commonly known as sink) in-side its component can be triggered by other (malicious) apps. In the prior works, detecting these ECVs use a set of sinks pertaining to the ECVs under detection. In this paper, we argue that a more comprehensive and effective approach should start by a systematic selection and classification of vulnerability-specific sinks (VSinks). The set of VSinks is much larger than those used in the previous works. Based on these VSinks, our sink-driven approach can detect dif-ferent kinds of ECVs in an app in two steps. First, VSinks and their categories are identified through a typical forward reachability analysis. Second, based on each VSinkâs cate-gory, a corresponding detection method is used to identify the ECV via a customized backward dataflow analysis. We also design a semi-auto guided analysis and validation ca-pability for system-only broadcast checking to remove some false positives. We implement our sink-driven approach in a tool called ECVDetector and evaluate it with the top 1 K Android apps. Using ECVDetector we successfully identify a total of 49 vulnerable apps across all four ECV categories we have defined. To our knowledge, {{most of them are}} previ-ously undisclosed, such as the very popular Go SMS Pro and Clean Master. Moreover, the performance of ECVDetector is high, requiring only 9. 257 seconds on average to process each component. 1...|$|R

Bovine rotavirus was found to possess at least six structural polypeptides, three of them associated with the inner capsid (p 102 K, p 9 lK and p 45 K) and the others with the outer capsid (p 84 K, p 37 K and p 34 K). The most abundant polypeptide of the inner capsid was p 45 K, which accounted for approx. 80 % of the protein mass, followed by p 91 K (approx. 20 % of the protein mass) and pl 02 K (approx. 1 % of the protein mass). Polypeptide 45 K is not readily available for iodination, indicating that it is partially covered by p 91 K, {{which is the most}} exposed polypeptide of the inner capsid. The number of polypeptide molecules per single capsid particle (calculated on the basis of an RNA content of 16 %) was estimated to be approx. 6 molecules of pl 02 K, 140 of p 91 K and 989 of p 45 K.

40|$|The {{electron}} optical analog of immunofluorescence microscopy combines three developments: (i) photo-electron microscopy {{to produce}} a high-resolution image of <b>exposed</b> <b>components</b> of the cell, (ii) site-specific antibodies, and (iii) photoemissive markers coupled to the antibodies to make the distribution of sites visible. This approach, in theory, provides a way to extend the useful immunofluorescence microscopy technique to problems requiring much higher resolution. The resolution limit of fluorescence microscopy is limited to about 200 nm by the wavelength of the light used to form the image, whereas in photoelectron microscopy the image is formed by electrons (current resolution: 10 - 20 nm; theoretical limit: 5 nm or better depending on the electron optics). As a test system, cytoskeletons of CV- 1 epithelial cells were prepared under conditions that preserve microtubules, and the microtubule networks were visualized by both indirect immunofluorescence and immunophotoelectron microscopy using colloidal gold coated with antibodies. Colloidal gold serves as a label for immunophotoelectron microscopy, providing enhanced photoemission from labeled cellular components so that they stand out against the darker background of the remaining unlabeled structures. In samples prepared for both immunofluorescence and immunophotoelectron microscopy, individual microtubules in the same cells were visualized by both techniques. The photoemission of the colloidal gold markers is sufficiently high that the microtubules are easily recognized {{without reference to the}} immunofluorescence micrographs, indicating that this approach can be used, in combination with antibodies, to correlate structure and function in cell biological studies...|$|E
