5|$|In {{preparation}} for the cyclone, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for the Big Island. A tropical storm warning was subsequently issued for the same location, The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) sent 20 transportation, public works, and <b>health</b> <b>experts</b> to the region. Many schools were closed, including the University of Hawaii at Hilo and Hawaii Community College; as a result, an estimated 26,000 college students were sent home. As a weakening cyclone, Flossie produced light precipitation {{on the island of}} Hawaii. Large waves impacted south-facing beaches while the maximum sustained wind observed reached 39mph (63km/h) at South Point. No fatalities were reported.|$|E
5|$|The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) {{dispatched}} 20 transportation, {{public works}} and <b>health</b> <b>experts</b> to the region. Emergency shelters were opened, though were used little. The {{threat of the}} storm led to the closure of schools, including the University of Hawaii at Hilo and Hawaii Community College, forcing an estimated 26,000 college students to remain home. Some libraries, parks, private schools, banks and other businesses were also closed. Non-essential state employees were advised to remain at home, and emergency workers were mobilized to quickly assist {{in the aftermath of}} the storm. In advance of the storm, many tourists canceled reservations.|$|E
5|$|WHO first {{recommended}} {{destruction of}} the virus in 1986 and later set the date of destruction to be 30 December 1993. This was postponed to 30 June 1999. Due to resistance from the U.S. and Russia, in 2002 the World Health Assembly agreed to permit the temporary retention of the virus stocks for specific research purposes. Destroying existing stocks would reduce the risk involved with ongoing smallpox research; the stocks are not needed {{to respond to a}} smallpox outbreak. Some scientists have argued that the stocks may be useful in developing new vaccines, antiviral drugs, and diagnostic tests; however, a 2010 review by a team of public <b>health</b> <b>experts</b> appointed by WHO concluded that no essential public health purpose is served by the U.S. and Russia continuing to retain virus stocks. The latter view is frequently supported in the scientific community, particularly among veterans of the WHO Smallpox Eradication Program.|$|E

25|$|The World Health Organization {{considers}} smoking bans to have {{an influence}} to reduce demand for tobacco by creating an environment where smoking becomes increasingly more difficult and to help shift social norms away from the acceptance of smoking in everyday life.

25|$|Christopher Nolan's {{psychological}} crime film Memento (2000) {{contains a}} distinguished depiction of anterograde amnesia, {{in that the}} character Leonard Shelby is trying to identify and kill the man who raped and murdered his wife, and does so through a system of writing crucial details related to the search on his body and on the blank spaces of Polaroid photographs. Mental <b>health</b> <b>experts</b> have described Memento {{as one of the}} most accurate depictions of amnesia in film history, an accuracy that was enhanced by the film's fragmented, non-linear structure that mimics the protagonist's memory problems.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, legislators, <b>health</b> <b>experts</b> and {{consumer}} advocates are considering levying higher {{taxes on the}} sale of soft drinks and other sweetened beverages to help curb the epidemic of obesity among Americans, and its harmful impact on overall health. Some speculate that higher taxes could help reduce soda consumption. Others say that taxes should help fund education to increase consumer awareness of the unhealthy effects of excessive soft drink consumption, and also help cover costs of caring for conditions resulting from overconsumption. The food and beverage industry holds considerable clout in Washington, DC, as it has contributed more than $50 million to legislators since 2000.|$|E
25|$|WHO has the {{broadest}} health mandate under the UN system, including setting priorities, coordinating global health surveillance, and emergency {{assistance in the}} event of disease outbreaks. <b>Health</b> <b>experts</b> give WHO credit for major successes, such as the eradication of smallpox, near eradication of polio, and substantial progress in controlling childhood diseases, and in expanding primary health care in developing countries. WHO defenders blame continued member state parsimony that has kept WHO's regular biennial budget to roughly $850 million for several years and forced it to rely more on voluntary contributions that often come with strings attached as the cause of its shortcomings. This situation led to lack of focus at the top level as well as overly optimistic forecasts.|$|E

25|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of European {{settlers}} in the 18th century, the Anacostia River was a fast-flowing and relatively silt-free river with very few mudflats or marshes. White settlers cleared much of the surrounding forest for farmland, however, and extensive soil erosion led to a heavy load of silt and effluent in the Anacostia. The construction of the Pennsylvania Avenue, Benning, and other bridges and the diversion of inflowing streams to agricultural use also slowed the river's current, allowing much of the silt to settle and be deposited. Between 1860 and the late 1880s, large mudflats ("the Anacostia flats") formed on both banks of the Anacostia River due to this deforestation and runoff. At this time, the city allowed its sewage to pour untreated into the Anacostia. Marsh grass began growing in the flats, trapping the sewage and leading public <b>health</b> <b>experts</b> to conclude that the flats were unsanitary. Health officials also feared that the flats were a prime breeding ground for malaria- and yellow fever-carrying mosquitoes.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, the Duchess {{launched}} the Big Bone walk campaign, leading 90 children and osteoporosis sufferers for a 10-mile walk and climb around Loch Muick at the Balmoral Estate in Scotland {{to raise money}} for the charity. The campaign raised £200,000 and continues almost every year as one of the fundraisers for the charity. In 2011, she appeared in the BBC Radio drama The Archers, playing herself, to raise the profile of the disease, and in 2013 teamed up with the television series Strictly Come Dancing to raise funds for the National Osteoporosis Society. By 2006 she had spoken at more than 60 functions on the disease in the UK and around the world and had also opened bone scanning units and osteoporosis centres to help sufferers of the disease. Almost every year, the Duchess attends and partakes in World Osteoporosis Day, by attending events around the UK on 20 October.

2500|$|Once these federal habeas {{proceedings}} had ended, {{the state}} trial judge, Steven Ables, set an execution date of February 5, 2004. At this point, Panetti {{claimed that he}} was incompetent to be executed. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied Panetti's appeal, and Panetti filed another federal habeas petition. [...] On February 4, 2004, the federal district court stayed Panetti's execution {{in order to allow}} the state courts to adjudicate Panetti's claim of mental incompetence. The state trial court, in turn, appointed two mental <b>health</b> <b>experts</b> to evaluate Panetti. Lawyers defending Panetti were given a one-week notice to also acquire mental <b>health</b> <b>experts</b> to also evaluate Panetti. Both of the experts for the state concluded that Panetti was malingering in order to avoid execution. Panetti responded by arguing that the trial court's procedures did not comply with the procedures set forth in Ford v. Wainwright. The state trial court responded by closing the case, ruling that Panetti did not show he was incompetent to be executed. [...] He did not appeal to either the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals or the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E
