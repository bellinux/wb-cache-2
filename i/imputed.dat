5|$|Fine-mapping {{requires}} all variants in {{the associated}} region {{to have been}} genotyped or <b>imputed</b> (dense coverage), very stringent quality control resulting in high-quality genotypes, and large sample sizes sufficient in separating out highly correlated signals. There are several different methods to perform fine-mapping, and all methods produce a posterior probability that a variant in that locus is causal. Because the requirements are often difficult to satisfy, there are still limited examples of these methods being more generally applied.|$|E
5|$|Two {{versions}} {{of the events that}} {{led to the creation of}} the new archdiocese appear in the form of an exchange of letters in 798 between Coenwulf and Pope Leo III. Coenwulf asserted in his letter that Offa wanted the new archdiocese created out of enmity for Jaenberht, the Archbishop of Canterbury at the time of the division; but Leo responded that the only reason the papacy agreed to the creation was because of the size of the kingdom of Mercia. The comments of both Coenwulf and Leo are partisan, as each had his own reasons for representing the situation as they did: Coenwulf was entreating Leo to make London the sole southern archdiocese, while Leo was concerned to avoid the appearance of complicity with the unworthy motives Coenwulf <b>imputed</b> to Offa. Coenwulf's desire to move the southern archbishopric to London would have been influenced by the situation in Kent, where Archbishop Æthelheard had been forced to flee by Eadberht Præn. Coenwulf would have wished to retain control over the archiepiscopal seat, and at the time he wrote to the pope Kent was independent of Mercia.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} Greek {{thought about}} poetry considered the theogonies {{to be the}} prototypical poetic genre—the prototypical mythos—and <b>imputed</b> almost magical powers to it. Orpheus, the archetypal poet, also was the archetypal singer of theogonies, which he uses to calm seas and storms in Apollonius' Argonautica, and to move the stony hearts of the underworld gods in his descent to Hades. When Hermes invents the lyre in the Homeric Hymn to Hermes, {{the first thing he}} does is sing about the birth of the gods. Hesiod's Theogony is not only the fullest surviving account of the gods, but also the fullest surviving account of the archaic poet's function, with its long preliminary invocation to the Muses. Theogony also was the subject of many lost poems, including those attributed to Orpheus, Musaeus, Epimenides, Abaris, and other legendary seers, which were used in private ritual purifications and mystery-rites. There are indications that Plato was familiar with some version of the Orphic theogony. A silence would have been expected about religious rites and beliefs, however, and that nature of the culture would not have been reported by members of the society while the beliefs were held. After they ceased to become religious beliefs, few would have known the rites and rituals. Allusions often existed, however, to aspects that were quite public.|$|E

40|$|Genotype {{imputation}} {{is increasingly}} employed in genome-wide association studies, particularly for integrative and cross-platform analysis. Several imputation algorithms use reference panels {{with a larger}} set of genotyped markers to infer genotypes at ungenotyped marker locations. Our objective was to assess which method and reference panel was more accurate when carrying out imputation. We investigated the influence of choice of two most popular imputation methods, <b>IMPUTE</b> and MACH, on two reference panels from the HapMap and the 1000 Genomes Project. Our results indicated that for the HapMap, MACH consistently yielded more accurate imputation results than <b>IMPUTE,</b> while for the 1000 Genomes Project, <b>IMPUTE</b> performed slightly better. The best imputation results were achieved by <b>IMPUTE</b> with the combined reference panel (HapMap + 1000 Genomes Project). <b>IMPUTE</b> with the combined reference panel is a promising strategy for genotype imputation, which should facilitate fine-mapping for discovery as well as known disease-associated candidate regions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Multiple {{imputation}} (MI) is a practical, principled {{approach to}} han-dling missing data. When used to <b>impute</b> missing values in covariates of regression models, imputation models may be mis-specified {{if they are}} not compatible with the substantive model of interest for the outcome. In this article we introduce the smcfcs command, which <b>imputes</b> covariates by substantive model compati-ble fully conditional specification (SMC–FCS). This modifies the popular FCS or chained equations approach to MI by <b>imputing</b> each covariate compatibly with a user-specified substantive model. The smcfcs command is illustrated through application to data from a study investigating time to tumour recurrence in breast cancer...|$|R

Cittas (awareness events) are never experienced on their own, but are always intentional and hence accompanied by various mental factors (cetasikas), in a constantly flowing stream of experience occurrences.|$|E
