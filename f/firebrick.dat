25|$|Rockets first firebox was {{of copper}} sheet {{and of a}} {{somewhat}} triangular shape from the side. The throatplate was of <b>firebrick,</b> possibly the backhead too. When rebuilt around 1831, this {{was replaced by a}} wrought iron backhead and throatplate, with a drum wrapper (now missing), presumed to be of copper, between them. This gave a larger internal volume and encouraged better combustion within the firebox, rather than inside the tubes. These early fireboxes formed a separate water space from the boiler drum and were connected by prominent external copper pipes.|$|E
25|$|In 1863, {{development}} {{along the}} banks of Potrero Point consisted of two powder magazines on the southern side of the steep peninsula, located so as to keep dangerous commodities away from populated areas. Heavy industry first located on the point in 1866 when six wealthy San Francisco industrialists came together to organize the Pacific Rolling Mills with the plan to roll iron from scrap, in the hope of producing homegrown iron products, including railroad iron. Access to deep water was a necessity for delivering coal from Australia to fuel the mills, <b>firebrick</b> and clay from Liverpool and scrap iron from around the Pacific Rim and as far away as England.|$|E

50|$|Pindi Pindi Brickworks is a heritage-listed former brickworks off the Bruce Highway, Pindi Pindi, Mackay Region, Queensland, Australia. It {{was built}} in 1933.

50|$|Crucial for the {{durability}} {{and efficiency of}} reverberatory furnaces was construction by skilled bricklayers and good quality <b>firebricks</b> - {{both of which were}} in short supply in Australia at the time. The furnaces at Adolphus William were constructed from <b>firebricks</b> made in Cumbernauld, Dunbartonshire, Scotland by the Cumbernauld Fire-Clay Company.|$|R
25|$|The Woolnough {{design was}} used by Sentinel for their larger railway locomotives. It resembled most other three-drum designs, having almost-straight tubes. Its {{distinguishing}} feature was a <b>firebrick</b> wall {{two-thirds of the way}} down the furnace. The furnace grate was on the longer side of this, with the combustion gases passing out through the tube bank, along inside a steel outer casing, then back within the shorter tube bank. Coiled tube superheaters were placed in the gas flow outside the tubes. The combustion gases thus passed through the tube bank twice, once outwards and then again inwards. A single central chimney exhausted from the centre of the far end, not as usual from outside the tubes. The relative temperature difference between gas passage through the two sections of the bank led to a circulation current that was upwards through the first, hotter, part of the bank and downwards through the further, less hot, bank. Circulation was also controlled by an internal weir plate within the upper water drum, so as to keep a depth of water above the ends of the hotter tubes, thus avoiding overheating of dry tubes.|$|E
25|$|This {{was in part}} {{facilitated}} by improved transportation in the area. The Crane and Thomas Iron Companies wanted a railroad to bring local ore to their furnaces, but faced strong local opposition when attempting to gain a charter. As a compromise, the Catasauqua and Fogelsville Plank Road corporation was chartered on July 2, 1853, to build a plank road from the ore pits to the furnaces. A short section of plank road was constructed, but the exceptional weight of the ore wagons quickly destroyed it. Renewed efforts to palliate the local farmers were successful, and the plank road was renamed and rechartered on April 20, 1854 as the Catasauqua and Fogelsville Railroad. The C began hauling ore from the mines near Fogelsville in 1857. In 1864, it was further extended to a connection with the East Pennsylvania Railroad at Alburtis and in 1865, to the magnetite mines at Rittenhouse Gap. Improvements to the physical plant also occurred, building No. 6 stack in 1868. The company survived the Panic of 1873 and the subsequent poor iron market, and No. 5 stack was rebuilt in 1877, introducing new <b>firebrick</b> heat exchangers (stoves) to heat the blast, rather than the iron pipes heretofore used. No. 3 stack collapsed in 1879 while out of blast, and Nos. 1 and 2 were subsequently demolished. A new No. 1 and 3 were built, and the site of No. 2 used for stoves for the new furnaces, which were built in 1880 and put in service in 1881. Joshua Hunt resigned the superintendency on January 1, 1882, {{six months before the}} death of his father-in-law, David Thomas.|$|E

This is an O-type boiler with a single lower water drum and curved tubes, rather than the triangular arrangement with two drums used by the Admiralty. The first boiler design suffered from poor circulation and so external cold downcomers were added, making the reworked boiler 10% heavier. The boiler was well-regarded in service as it reduced the amount of potentially troublesome refractory <b>firebrick</b> usually used for {{the base of the}} furnace.|$|E

50|$|Local {{shareholders}} in the Mackay area {{invested in}} the establishment of the works, with the brickworks trading under the name of Evans <b>Firebricks</b> Ltd. In 1934, the works employed 18 local workers, three of whom quarried the material at the clay pit and fifteen employed in the works environment. 78 000 bricks were produced during this time. Increasing demand for building bricks, as well as for <b>firebricks,</b> necessary for the sugar industry in North Queensland, saw the continued expansion of the brickworks.|$|R
50|$|The former Pindi Pindi Brickworks, {{established}} in 1933, is important as an industrial in North Queensland, demonstrating industrial {{processes of the}} inter-war period. The establishment of the Brickworks resulted from the demand for the supply of building materials in North Queensland, {{as well as being}} the source of production for the supply of <b>firebricks</b> for the local sugar milling industry. It was the first brickworks to be established outside Brisbane capable of producing refactory <b>firebricks,</b> supplying these by contract to Queensland Railways.|$|R
500|$|The Leader had a [...] "dry lining" [...] firebox. It was not {{surrounded}} on top {{and sides}} by a [...] "jacket" [...] of water as in normal practice, but was constructed of welded steel and used firebricks instead of water for insulation, a novel but troublesome solution. Using firebricks reduced the grate area from [...] to [...] and concentrated the fire in a smaller area. The firehole door was offset {{to the left of}} the boiler backhead, which created difficulties for the fireman when adding coal to the fire. The firebox was not initially equipped with a <b>firebrick</b> arch, although one was retro-fitted during the summer of 1950. The arch was problematic because it led to a tendency for flames to enter the cab at high outputs, a situation made worse by the narrowing of the firebox area.|$|E
500|$|Throughout No. 36001's trials, the <b>firebrick</b> lining {{provided}} a constant problem by continually collapsing into the fire. The firebricks were then replaced with cast iron substitutes that melted in the intense {{heat of the}} firebox, which were in turn replaced by thicker [...] firebricks. Some of the firemen allotted to the Leader complained about cramped conditions in the centre cab of the locomotive, a situation made worse by flames entering the cab from the firebox at high outputs. It was an enclosed space that was constantly hot and the single fireman's entrance door {{on the side of}} the locomotive was left open during travel to promote ventilation. The door into the fireman's cab also attracted criticism, as it would have been blocked in the event of the locomotive overturning on that side, preventing the fireman's escape, so that members of the railway trade union ASLEF threatened to stop their crews from operating the Leader.|$|E
2500|$|For {{a period}} of 130 years from 1784 the common was in private hands and was an area of mining and quarrying, with coal and {{ganister}} being mined and sandstone quarried for building. There were two drift mines on the common, the Bower mine and the Top mine. The Bower mine was owned by the Oughtibridge Silica <b>Firebrick</b> Company and operated between 1890 and 1940 while the Top mine probably ceased production in 1943.|$|E

2500|$|The metal stove was a {{technological}} development concurrent with the industrial revolution. [...] Stoves were manufactured or constructed {{pieces of equipment}} that contained the fire on all sides and provided a means for controlling the draftthe amount of air allowed to reach the fire.

[...] Metal stoves are often lined with refractory materials such as <b>firebrick,</b> since the hottest part of a woodburning fire will burn away steel {{over the course of several}} years' use.|$|E
2500|$|Firing {{was with}} coal, at just one end through a {{conventional}} locomotive single firedoor, {{and a single}} manual fireman. Owing to the single-ended firing and the predominantly longitudinal gasflow, compared to the Yarrow's normal through-bank gasflow, there was a pronounced temperature difference between {{the front and back}} of the boiler. This led to the water circulation currents, especially in the second section, to be longitudinal through the water drums, like the Woolnough, rather than the usual Yarrow. [...] The first section, which included some water-tubes to the rear wall, was radiant heated and effectively a water-wall furnace, without any gas flow through the tube bank. Despite this, it still used four rows of tubes. The second section had its gasflow arranged by steel and <b>firebrick</b> baffles so that the combustion gases entered through the centre and passed through the tube banks into the side flues, giving better convective heat transfer.|$|E

50|$|Fusibility is {{the quality}} of objects of being fusible or {{convertible}} especially to heat.Materials such as solder require a relatively low melting point so that when heat is applied to a joint, the solder will melt before the materials being soldered together melt, i.e. high fusibility.

Materials that only melt at very high temperatures are called refractory materials.|$|R
