The {{performance}} of a packed-bed reactor typically used in Gas-to-Liquid (GTL) or Biomass-to-Liquid (BTL) technologies in producing liquid fuels was affected by unfavorable high pressure drop, flow and temperature maldistributions which in turn could cause severe catalyst deactivation, and result in inefficient reaction etc. A certain types of <b>fluid</b> <b>mixers</b> such as Kenics TM or Mixing & Stirring type static mixers had been suggested to improve the {{performance of}} this type of reactor. In order to design a proper modified reactor by mean of an installation of such mixing structures for the pilot plant in liquid fuel production via Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) conducted at the RCC research center, this study had to characterize the hydrodynamics and heat transfers within a packed-bed modified by Kenics TM and Mixing & Stirring type static mixers.

40|$|Laminar {{gas flow}} {{in a nuclear}} fuel {{assembly}} is of interest for complete loss-of-coolant accident scenarios in spent fuel pools and for performance analyses of dry storage casks. For this study, velocity profiles were measured across the bundle of a prototypic pressurized water reactor (PWR) fuel assembly using a laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV). The results for two containment cells representative of values spanning pool and cask cells available in industry are reported here. The apparatus was tested in what is traditionally considered the laminar regime for Reynolds numbers equal to 100 and 900, based on the average assembly velocity and hydraulic diameter. Mixing vanes present in the spacers and intermediate <b>fluid</b> <b>mixers</b> were observed to impart long-lived wake disturbances into the flow as evidenced by non-zero root-mean-square fluctuations in the flow.

40|$|We {{present a}} new {{technique}} for 3 -D position sensing and active magnetic levitation of a steel ball {{for use in a}} levitating ball viscometer. In order to achieve a stable levitation, a very sensitive positioning measurement system is mandatory. For this task the differential transformer principle was chosen to realize a 3 -D position measurement. This leads to a purely magnetic sensor and actuator system without the need for other transducer types such as optical readout. The actuation utilizes power efficient switch-mode electronic circuitry which opens the possibility of upscaling the device, if demanded, for future applications. It is shown that this switch-mode actuation can be combined directly with the position measurement when special switching patterns are applied. A position resolution of [*]∼[*]  100  µm in all three axial directions at a sample rate of 476. 19  Hz is achieved. For viscosity sensing, the steel ball is magnetically driven to orbital movements of variable revolution frequency of up to 2. 5  Hz within a fluid chamber. The frequency response is analyzed and related to the shear viscosity of the fluid under test. As a proof of concept, measurements in various viscous liquids were performed with the prototype, showing promising results in the range of 1 – 10  mPa s. The principle may also be of interest for applications beyond viscosity sensing, such as <b>fluid</b> <b>mixers,</b> or as actuators in microfluidic devices...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, mixing {{between two}} liquid streams {{of the same}} flow rate in a planar mixing channel {{enhanced}} by means of three lateral synthetic jet pairs is examined using PLIF and PIV at net flow Reynolds numbers of Ren= 2, 10 and 83. The changes in the flow Reynolds numbers are produced {{with the use of}} fluids with different dynamic viscosities. The synthetic jet pairs are operated 180 o out-of-phase and at a range of actuation frequencies (characterized by the dimensionless Strouhal number Str) and displacements (characterized by the dimensionless stroke length L). It is found that at a sufficiently high frequency or dimensionless stroke length, a homogenous mixing can be achieved. Our experimental evidence shows that the synthetic jet pairs enhance mixing via two key mechanisms, i. e. vortex interaction and entrainment; tearing and stretching of liquid interface. A functional relationship among Ren, Str and L to ensure a nearly homogenous mixing is also obtained by best fitting the experimental data. It can be used for selecting the synthetic jet operating conditions to ensure a good mixing for a scaled version of this <b>fluid</b> <b>mixer.</b> This correlation indicates that the effectiveness of mixing has a weak dependence on Ren, implying that the fluid mixers of such a design can be effective over a wide range of net flow Reynolds numbers and for fluids of different viscosities...|$|E

We find that chaotic mixing is suitable for shear-thickening fluids for which we observe a clear enhancement of the thermal mixing (heat extraction and homogenization).

This work {{was performed to}} verify experimentally {{the effectiveness of the}} extractor at mixing viscous fluids of both Newtonian and non-Newtonian rheology representative of Hanford single- and double-shell wastes, respectively. Developing the computational models and validating their results by comparing them with experimental results would enable simulations of the mixing process for a range of fluid properties and mixing speeds. Five tests were performed with a full-scale, optically transparent model extractor to provide the data needed to compare mixing times for <b>fluid</b> rheology, <b>mixer</b> rotational direction, and mixing speed variation. The computer model was developed and exercised to simulate the tests. The tests demonstrated that rotational direction of the pitched impeller blades was not as important as fluid rheology in determining mixing time. The Newtonian fluid required at least six hours to mix at the hot cell operating speed of 3 rpm, and the non-Newtonian fluid required at least 46 hours at 3 rpm to become significantly mixed. In the non-Newtonian fluid tests, stagnant regions within the fluid sometimes required days to be fully mixed. Higher-speed (30 rpm) testing showed that the laminar mixing time was correlated to mixing speed. The tests demonstrated that, using the RGS extractor and current procedures, complete mixing of the waste samples in the hot cell should not be expected. The computer simulation of Newtonian fluid mixing gave results comparable to the test while simulation of non-Newtonian fluid mixing would require further development.

40|$|Abstract—Positron {{emission}} particle tracking (PEPT) is {{a technique}} in which a single radioactive tracer particle can be accurately tracked as it moves. A limitation of PET is {{that in order to}} reconstruct a tomographic image it is necessary to acquire a large volume of data (millions of events), so it is difficult to study rapidly changing systems. By considering this fact, PEPT is a very fast process compared with PET. In PEPT detecting both photons defines a line and the annihilation is assumed to have occurred somewhere along this line. The location of the tracer can be determined to within a few mm from coincident detection of a small number of pairs of back-to-back gamma rays and using triangulation. This can be achieved many times per second and the track of a moving particle can be reliably followed. This technique was invented at the University of Birmingham [1]. The attempt in PEPT is not to form an image of the tracer particle but simply to determine its location with time. If this tracer is followed for a long enough period within a closed, circulating system it explores all possible types of motion. The application of PEPT to industrial process systems carried out at the University of Birmingham is categorized in two subjects: the behaviour of granular materials and viscous fluids. Granular materials are processed in industry for example in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, ceramics, food, polymers and PEPT has been used {{in a number of ways}} to study the behaviour of these systems [2]. PEPT allows the possibility of tracking a single particle within the bed [3]. Also PEPT has been used for studying systems such as: fluid flow, viscous <b>fluids</b> in <b>mixers</b> [4], using a neutrally-buoyant tracer particle [5]...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study four {{problems}} with potential biological and industrial applications which rely on fluid mixing and transport. The problem of simultaneous ultrafiltration, diffusion and osmosis across a membrane separating two fluids is studied, numerically and asymptotically, {{as a model}} for an artificial kidney dialyser. Couplings between the different transport mechanisms prove significant in determining overall transport rates. Our model appears {{to be the first to}} treat the three transport mechanisms in a spatially structured framework, and shows that previous, spatially averaged models can overestimate transport rates. Our results can be used to optimise dialyser geometry and to profile dialysis sessions. The remainder of this thesis concerns some fundamentals of <b>fluid</b> mixing and <b>mixer</b> design. Techniques for assessing the quality of fluid mixing are reviewed, and applied to a two-dimensional laminar chaotic flow. We find no outright optimum mixing method across the range of measures, suggesting that `sieving' a collection of mixing methods according to increasingly complicated mixing measures may fail to identify a global optimum. `Topological chaos' appears to allow good mixing stretch rate to be built-in to batch mixer design, avoiding the need to tune the mixer parameters, provided a correct flow topology is created. We show that the theoretical stretch rate predictions are achieved quite tightly, in practice in a significant fraction of the flow domain; we investigate the practicalities of topologically chaotic mixers. Finally, we discuss whether topological chaos may also apply to three-dimensional static mixer design, in a braided pipe mixer, in which pipe flow is mixed around carefully designed twisted inner pipes. We expect such a device to mix well if the inner pipes have appropriate topology. However, we demonstrate how three-dimensional flow features can undermine mixing performance.

In the 80 s a new device called the Cavity Transfer Mixer (CTM) was invented and patented by Gale at Rapra Technology Limited, as an add-on to be mounted downstream of existing extruders, {{in order to improve}} distributive mixing. The CTM consists of two concentric cylinders, the rotor and the stator, both provided with staggered rows of hemispherical cavities. The inner cylinder (rotor) rotates, while the outer (stator) remains still. At the same time, the pressure load imposed upstream, pushes the <b>fluid</b> through the <b>mixer.</b> The result of the interaction between the moving geometry, the imposed pressure load and the rheology of the fluid is the complex flow field driving the mixing mechanisms inside the device.

In this context, the present work proposes a full three dimensional model of the CTM, able to accurately simulate the device operations. A finite element solver provides the transient velocity field, which is used in the mapping method implementation in order to compute the concentration field evolution. A broad range of simulations is run assessing the impact on mixing of several geometrical and functioning parameters, such as the number of cavities per row, the number of rows, the size of the mixer, the rheology of the fluid and the ratio between the rotation speed and the fluid throughput.
