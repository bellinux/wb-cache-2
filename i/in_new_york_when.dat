5|$|The {{entirety}} of modern-day NY164 was originally designated as NY312 in the 1930 renumbering of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>When</b> the NY312 designation was shifted south {{to its current}} location {{in the town of}} Southeast , its former routing in Patterson became part of an extended NY216, which connected with its current routing by way of modern NY311, NY292 and NY55. NY216 was truncated to its current length on January1, 1970. The portion of its former alignment between NY311 and NY22 was then redesignated as NY164.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} NY812 {{date back to}} the 1930 {{renumbering}} of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> <b>when</b> the portion of modern NY812 from Lowville to Croghan became part of NY26A and the segment of modern NY812 between De Kalb and Ogdensburg was designated as the northernmost portion of New York State Route87. NY87 originally extended as far south as Harrisville; however, it was truncated north to Edwards in the 1940s and farther north to De Kalb in the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|Arthur {{was born}} in Fairfield, Vermont, grew up in upstate New York, and practiced law in New York City. He served as {{quartermaster}} general in the New York Militia during the American Civil War. Following the war, he devoted more time to Republican politics and quickly rose in the political machine run by New York Senator Roscoe Conkling. Appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant to the lucrative and politically powerful post of Collector of the Port of New York in 1871, Arthur was an important supporter of Conkling and the Stalwart faction of the Republican Party. In 1878, the new president, Rutherford B. Hayes, fired Arthur {{as part of a}} plan to reform the federal patronage system <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>When</b> Garfield won the Republican nomination for president in 1880, Arthur, an eastern Stalwart, was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket.|$|E
5|$|Brady {{was born}} on April 9, 1815, in New York City, the eldest son of Thomas S. Brady and his wife. Later, Brady would have seven siblings, two boys and five girls. The senior Brady had emigrated from Ireland to the United States while the War of 1812 was ongoing, and started a boys school <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>When</b> James was seven, he {{attended}} his father's school. In 1831 James's father had left teaching to become a lawyer, and he helped his father in his practice and in trials. In his father's office, James studied legal material tirelessly, and soon operated most of the firm's managerial affairs.|$|E
5|$|Cagney {{remained}} in retirement for 20 years, conjuring {{up images of}} Jack L. Warner every time he was tempted to return, which soon dispelled the notion. After he had turned down an offer to play Alfred Doolittle in My Fair Lady, he {{found it easier to}} rebuff others, including a part in The Godfather Part II. He made few public appearances, preferring to spend winters in Los Angeles, and summers either at his Martha's Vineyard farm or at Verney Farms <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>When</b> in New York, Billie Vernon and he held numerous parties at the Silver Horn restaurant, where they got to know Marge Zimmermann, the proprietress.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, the New York State Legislature created Route46, an {{unsigned}} legislative route {{extending from}} Coopers Plains in Steuben County to Trumansburg in Tompkins County via Watkins Glen. East of Watkins Glen, Route46 proceeded generally northeastward through Burdett, Reynoldsville and Mecklenburg {{on its way}} to Trumansburg. On March1, 1921, the Route46 designation was reassigned to another highway in Allegany and Steuben counties as part of a partial renumbering of the legislative route system. The section of pre-1921 Route46 between Mecklenburg and Perry City went unnumbered until the 1930 renumbering of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> <b>when</b> it became part of NY79.|$|E
5|$|In Tompkins County, {{the road}} was reconstructed {{as part of a}} project {{contracted}} out on August24, 1916. Work on the highway was completed in the early-to-mid-1920s, and the improved road was added to the state highway system as SH1433. The Groton–Cortland state highway did not have a posted route number until the 1930 renumbering of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> <b>when</b> hundreds of state-maintained highways were assigned a designation for the first time. SH446, SH996, and SH1433 were collectively designated as NY222, which continued east into downtown Cortland by way of locally maintained streets. The alignment of NY222 has not been changed since that time.|$|E
5|$|Jesse is Jewish and {{was brought}} up in a secular Jewish family that {{originated}} in Poland and Ukraine. He attended the East Brunswick Public Schools at Frost School, Hammarskjold Middle School, Churchill Junior High School, and spent his sophomore year at East Brunswick High School. Eisenberg then transferred to the High School of Performing Arts <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>When</b> he was a senior, he received his breakthrough role in the independent comedy-drama film Roger Dodger. His work in the film prevented Eisenberg from enrolling at New York University. Instead, Eisenberg would go on to study anthropology and contemporary architecture at The New School in Greenwich Village, where he majored in liberal arts, with a concentration in democracy and cultural pluralism.|$|E

5|$|NY3 {{remained}} {{on what is}} now NY31 between Middleport and Medina until the 1930 renumbering of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>when</b> it was realigned between the two villages to use what is now NY31E. U.S. Route104 was assigned to all of Ridge Road , replacing then-NY31 west of Rochester. As a result, NY31 was shifted southward onto most of NY3 from Niagara Falls to Rochester, including between Middleport and Medina. NY31 was realigned on January1, 1949, to follow its current alignment between the two villages. The former routing of NY31 was redesignated as NY31E, a northerly alternate route of NY31.|$|E
5|$|The north–south highway {{connecting}} Crompond Road to {{the hamlet}} of Shrub Oak {{was acquired by}} the state of New York in the mid-1920s. It did not have a posted route number until the 1930 renumbering of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>when</b> it became part of NY132, a new route extending from US6 in Shrub Oak to NY22 near the hamlet of Katonah. The highway went southeast from Shrub Oak to Yorktown Heights on Crompond Street and Crompond Road, from where it traveled generally eastward to Katonah on Hallocks Mill, Saw Mill River, Amawalk, and Woods Bridge roads. In Katonah, NY132 used Woods Bridge Road, Bedford Road, and Jay Street to connect to NY22.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the route date back to 1914 when its routing was {{included}} {{as part of a}} spur route of Route30, a cross-state, unsigned legislative route. The spur route was eliminated in 1921, and the road went unnumbered until 1930 renumbering of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>when</b> it became part of NY3. Most of NY3 west of Rochester was replaced by NY31 in the mid-1930s, and NY31 was realigned onto its present, more southerly alignment between Middleport and Medina in 1949. Its former canalside alignment became NY31E at this time. Most of NY31E is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT); however, two sections in Niagara County and Medina are locally maintained.|$|E

5|$|After James was deposed by William III and Mary II in the Glorious Revolution in late 1688, Massachusetts rose up in {{rebellion}} against Andros, arresting {{him and other}} dominion leaders in Boston. The revolt rapidly spread through the dominion, and the New England colonies quickly restored their pre-dominion governments. When news of the Boston revolt reached New York a week later, Nicholson took no steps to announce news of it, or of the revolution in England, for fear of raising prospects of rebellion <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>When</b> word of the Boston revolt reached Long Island, politicians and militia leaders became more assertive, and by mid-May dominion officials had been ousted {{from a number of}} communities. At the same time, Nicholson learned that France had declared war on England, bringing the threat of French and Indian attacks on New York's northern frontier. In an attempt to mollify panicked citizenry over rumored Indian raids, Nicholson invited the militia to join the army garrison at Fort James.|$|E
5|$|Mikoyan {{supported}} Stalin, whom he {{had first}} met in 1919, in the power struggle that followed Lenin's death in 1924; {{he had become a}} member of the Bolshevik Central Committee in 1923. As People's Commissar for External and Internal Trade from 1926, he imported ideas from the West, such as the manufacture of canned goods. In 1935 he was elected to the Politburo, and was among one of the first Soviet leaders to pay goodwill trips to the United States in order to boost economic cooperation. Mikoyan spent three months in the United States, where he not only learned more about its food industry but also met and spoke with Henry Ford and inspected Macy's <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> <b>When</b> he returned, Mikoyan introduced a number of popular American consumer products to the Soviet Union, including American hamburgers, ice cream, corn flakes, popcorn, tomato juice, grapefruit, and corn on the cob.|$|E
5|$|SH1290 was not {{assigned}} a signed designation until the 1930 renumbering of state highways <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>when</b> it {{became part of}} NY250, a new route that extended south over SH1836 to NY15 (now NY96) in Perinton and north over SH574A and SH574 to Lake Road in Webster. When NY33B—the predecessor to NY31F—was assigned , it entered Fairport on Church Street and turned north at NY250, following the route across the Erie Canal to High Street, where NY33B turned to the east. The overlap with NY33B was replaced with a concurrency with NY31F after the latter route largely replaced the former in the late 1940s. The overlap was eliminated on April1, 1984, when NY31F was rerouted out of the village along East Church Street and Turk Hill Road {{as the result of}} a highway maintenance swap between the state of New York and the village of Fairport.|$|E

5|$|The {{high winds}} knocked down trees and power lines across Long Island, New York, leaving roughly 170,000residents without electricity. Power crews from Pennsylvania {{were called in}} to assist in {{restoring}} electricity. Damage across the island reached $8million, of which $3million stemmed from erosion at Rockaway Beach. One person was killed <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>when</b> a branch snapped off a tree due to high winds and fell on her. An estimated 36,000residents in the lower Hudson Valley lost power. President Ford later declared Nassau, Suffolk, and Rensselaer counties major disaster areas. Effects were similar in Connecticut where approximately 247,000people lost electricity. Commuter train service along Conrail's New York–New Haven line was canceled due to power outages. A portion of the Merritt Parkway was closed due to downed trees. High winds in Bridgeport toppled many trees and power lines, shattered windows, and sparked two house fires. Five boats in the city's harbor sustained damage. Flooding in and around Danbury prompted evacuations of an apartment complex and motel. One fatality took place in Barkhamsted due to slippery roads. Overall damage in Connecticut was far less than expected, according to state police, with losses reaching $7.1million and mostly stemming from Fairfield and New Haven counties. Power companies brought in additional personnel to expedite the restoration process, though many remained in the dark days after the storm. A couple and their two dogs in Vernon died from carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator on August14.|$|E
