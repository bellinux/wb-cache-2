In the metal and plastic industry, deep drawing is after bending one of the famous method for reshaping of sheet metals and polymers.

The hydroxyapatite structure influences bone ingrowth {{as well as its}} resorption. In particular, pore size must exceed 100 microm to allow new bone ingrowth. Because of its brittleness, highly porous hydroxyapatite is difficult to handle without causing damage, and, therefore, its mechanical performance has to be improved placing the material on a dense hydroxyapatite substrate. Dense/porous hydroxyapatite laminates can be obtained by slip casting technology. The method starts with the preparation of a ceramic powder-binder-solvent system. This slurry produces, after solvent evaporation, a soft <b>green</b> <b>tape,</b> that is successively baked at 300 degrees C to remove all organic component, and finally sintered at high temperature (1200 degrees C). The material porosity cannot be significantly modified by changes in the slurry composition and sintering temperature; therefore, the macroporous hydroxyapatite layer must be obtained using a porous hydroxyapatite powder. The powder is prepared by grinding of <b>green</b> <b>tape</b> pieces and the resulting coarse material is successively baked at 300 degrees C. Such material is mixed with a polymer solution and cast on a <b>green</b> <b>tape</b> substrate.

According to xi potential measurements, the LZSA glass powder particles showed acid surface characteristics and an IEP of around 4 when in aqueous media. The critical volume fraction of solids was about 72 wt% (27 vol%), which hindered the processability of more concentrated slurries. The glass particles also showed an anisometric profile, which contributed to an increase in the interactions between particles during flow.

Green density increases with increasing thermocompression pressure. Sintered densities, however, depend more on the macroscopic uniformity in the <b>green</b> <b>tapes.</b> When density gradients develop within the individual <b>green</b> <b>tapes</b> (because of improper drying), sintering is constrained in two dimensions and densities remain low.

The use of a revised thermocompression process involving shear deformation results in higher sintered densities and complete densification after HIPing. Sintered densities increase with the degree of shear strain during green-state deformation processing. Thus, green-state deformation can improve homogeneity in laminates.
