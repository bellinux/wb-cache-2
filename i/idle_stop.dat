25|$|In {{order to}} control costs, Honda {{decided not to}} include the electric-assist air {{conditioning}} compressor used in the Civic Hybrid. The Civic Hybrid's electric-assist allows the air conditioning compressor to continue running (using battery pack power) to maintain cabin temperature when the engine is shut off in <b>Idle</b> <b>Stop</b> mode. Instead, the Insight limits {{the duration of the}} <b>Idle</b> <b>Stop</b> mode during air conditioning use and restarts the engine, when needed, to maintain cabin temperature. However, when the Insight's ECON function is engaged, a longer <b>Idle</b> <b>Stop</b> time is invoked for improved fuel efficiency at the expense of rapid cabin cooling. In other words, the air conditioning stops whenever the car stops, as in stop-and-go traffic. During <b>Idle</b> <b>Stop</b> the blower continues to run albeit at a low speed.|$|E
25|$|The {{rack-and-pinion}} steering uses electric assist {{and allows the}} Insight to steer normally even when the engine is shut off in <b>Idle</b> <b>Stop</b> mode.|$|E
25|$|The {{braking system}} {{includes}} four-channel ABS, electronic brake distribution, and a creep aid system {{to prevent the}} car from rolling on a hill. A brake booster pressure monitoring system monitors vacuum when the engine is shut off during <b>Idle</b> <b>Stop</b> mode. Traction control and vehicle stability assist are also included. The front brakes are single-piston sliding caliper with a one-piece ventilated rotor. Drum brakes {{are used in the}} rear.|$|E

25|$|Before 1628, much of {{the area}} through which the River Torne now passes was waterlogged, and the river system was quite different. The River Don flowed across Hatfield Chase from Stainforth to Adlingfleet. The River Idle flowed northwards from the point later called <b>Idle</b> <b>Stop,</b> and joined the Don near to Sandtoft, while the Torne formed two {{channels}} {{to the west of}} Wroot, both of which joined the Idle.|$|E

2500|$|The River Idle is a {{river in}} Nottinghamshire, England. [...] Its source is the {{confluence}} of the River Maun and River Meden, near Markham Moor. [...] From there, it flows north through Retford and Bawtry before entering the River Trent at Stockwith near Misterton. The county boundary with South Yorkshire follows the river for a short distance near Bawtry, and the border with Lincolnshire does the same at <b>Idle</b> <b>Stop.</b> Originally, it flowed northwards from <b>Idle</b> <b>Stop</b> to meet the River Don on Hatfield Chase, but was diverted eastwards by drainage engineers in 1628.|$|E
50|$|Micra's new-generation Xtronic CVT {{features}} a new structure combining a belt-operated CVT with an auxiliary two-speed transmission. The CVT raises the transmission ratio {{by more than}} 20% compared to other CVTs in its class, providing enhanced responsiveness on starting and acceleration and improved quietness during high-speed driving. With the auxiliary transmission, the size and weight of the CVT unit is significantly reduced. Friction is reduced by about 30% compared to other CVTs in its class, achieved by the increased transmission ratio, reduced pulley size and weight, and reduced oil agitating resistance - helping improve fuel economy. An electric oil pump is adopted in vehicles equipped with <b>Idling</b> <b>Stop.</b> Quicker oil pressure response improves startup performance and thus contributes to an improvement in fuel economy. While <b>Idling</b> <b>Stop</b> is in operation, pulley rotation is temporarily locked inside the CVT and is slowly unlocked when the engine starts again. This prevents reverse movement during a hill start and enables smooth startup.|$|R

Later in February 2003 Toyota achieves dramatic fuel efficiency improvements through its Intelligent <b>Idling</b> <b>Stop</b> System developed by adding an electronic oil pump to the K210 belt-type CVT, ensuring excellent startup performance during engine restarts and producing class-leading fuel efficiency.|$|R
50|$|The global {{version of}} the Honda PCX is {{equipped}} with an <b>idling</b> <b>stop</b> system, which automatically shuts off the engine after few seconds of idle. This feature is not included on the US model due to safety concerns. To prevent excess wear on a separate starter motor, the Honda PCX uses its alternator by supplying power to the stator (see Brushless DC electric motor). As a result, engine start is completely muted.|$|R
2500|$|In 1626, Cornelius Vermuyden {{was given}} the task of {{draining}} Hatfield Chase, and he radically altered the rivers. The Don was routed northwards from Stainforth, to join the River Aire near Turnbridge, while the Idle was dammed at <b>Idle</b> <b>Stop,</b> and routed eastwards to join the Trent at West Stockwith. This left the Torne with no outfall, and a completely new channel was constructed for it, which was embanked on both sides. It ran in a north-easterly direction from Wroot for , crossing the Isle of Axholme, {{and then turned to}} the east for , where it entered the Trent at a sluice near Althorpe. At the same time, a drain was constructed which ran northwards from <b>Idle</b> <b>Stop</b> in a straight line for [...] to Dirtness. It passed under the new channel of the Torne at Tunnel Pits. At Dirtness it was joined by another new drain, some [...] long, flowing in from the west, and the combined flow was carried to the east for a further , to enter the Trent at another sluice at Althorpe. The Torne sluice was [...] wide, and the sluice on the drain was [...] wide.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the north}} side of the river, {{drainage}} is managed by the Finningley Internal Drainage Board, who are responsible for the maintenance of [...] of drains and ditches, which feed surplus water to four pumping stations. Hunters Hill, which is just above Haxey Gate bridge, and <b>Idle</b> <b>Stop</b> pumping stations are situated on the banks of the Idle, while Austerfield pumping station is set further back on the Austerfield Drain. The fourth pumping station is at Langholme, on the northern edge of the IDB area, and feeds into the Warping Drain, which joins the River Trent at Owston Ferry.|$|E
2500|$|Above <b>Idle</b> <b>Stop,</b> {{the river}} flows through {{an area where}} {{drainage}} {{is the responsibility of}} the Rivers Idle and Ryton Internal Drainage Board. The IDB was re-formed in 1987, its responsibilities having previously been performed by the Severn Trent Water Authority, and manages [...] of watercourses. Those to the west of the Idle drain into the river by gravity at a number of locations, but the region to the east of the river and to the north of Retford drains to a single outfall at Wiseton, where a pumping station pumps the water into the river when river levels are too high for gravity flow.|$|E
50|$|In August 2012, Nissan added {{their newly}} {{developed}} simple hybrid system called Smart Simple Hybrid or S-HYBRID. The Nissan Serena C26 S-HYBRID has its regeneration capacity and output {{power of the}} Eco Motor, which is an alternator that is used for Nissan's Serena having an <b>idling</b> <b>stop</b> mechanism and capable of restarting an engine, upgraded. Nissn added a lead sub-battery in the engine room for extended energy regeneration capacity. The Serena has a fuel economy of 15.2 km/L (approx 35.8mpg) under the JC08 test mode. In Malaysia, Tan Chong launched Nissan Serena S-Hybrid in July 2013.|$|R
50|$|The 1NR-FKE is {{a variant}} of the 1NR-FE {{introduced}} {{in the second quarter of}} 2014. Toyota claims it will have a maximum thermal efficiency of 38 percent.Major feature, this 1.3-liter gasoline engine is employing the Atkinson cycle like hybrid-dedicated Toyota engines. The maximum torque is lesser, but, this time, the maximum output is not reduced. Valves are driven with Variable Valve Timing-intelligent Electric VVT-iE. The intake port has a new shape that generates a strong vertical tumble flow.Combustion is improved, and loss reduced. Toyota says that with <b>idling</b> <b>stop</b> and other functions, it will lead to fuel efficiency gains of approximately 15 percent.|$|R

The piston {{stopping}} position after engine shutdown {{is the key}} factor for <b>idling</b> <b>stop</b> technology, the next starting process of the engine is decided by the piston position. The piston stop position detecting system is designed based on the gasoline direction injection 4 G 15. The system is composed of a high-speed data acquisition card, two optical sensors, an encoder, a cylinder pressure sensor, an amplifying circuit and an industrial computer. The state signals of the crankshaft and the camshaft are collected by the detecting system, the distribution probability of piston position is obtained.

2500|$|The Insight’s IMA {{includes}} a high-efficiency, lightweight, low-friction 1.3-liter SOHC i-VTEC 4-cylinder engine rated for [...] at 5800 rpm and [...] of torque from 1000–1700 rpm. The high torque at low rpm {{is made possible}} by the electric motor which contributes up to [...] at 1500 rpm and [...] of torque at 1000 rpm to the powertrain, assisting in acceleration and some steady state cruising situations at low-to-mid vehicle speeds. The motor acts as a generator during braking, steady cruising, gentle deceleration and coasting in order to recharge the IMA battery. The motor also serves as the engine starter, quickly spinning the engine to idle speed after <b>Idle</b> <b>Stop</b> and during normal vehicle starting. The system will automatically switch to a back-up, conventional 12-volt starter to start the engine if the IMA system is disabled or if the car is started at extreme cold temperatures. As an additional safety feature, Honda’s hybrid configuration allows the car to operate like a conventional, petrol-engine vehicle even if the IMA hybrid-electric motor system is completely disabled.|$|E
2500|$|A {{drainage}} channel called the New Idle River {{was constructed in}} a straight line from <b>Idle</b> <b>Stop</b> to Dirtness, crossing the Torne by a tunnel at Tunnel Pits, about halfway along its course. From Dirtness, it was routed to the east to Hirst, where it was joined by the new course of the Torne, and the two channels ran parallel to an outfall at Althorpe on the Trent. There {{was a great deal of}} dissatisfaction with the drainage scheme, which resulted in claims and counter-claims in the courts. A petition brought to the Privy Council by several local authorities from Nottinghamshire, alleging that the Participants had caused damage, was judged in their favour. The Commission of Sewers decided that a new cut was needed, to carry water from Misterton, Gringley and Everton to the Trent, and so relieve the Idle, but only about [...] was constructed before landowners objected and the work was not completed. During the English civil war, much of the scheme was damaged. The Participants supported the King, while commoners on the Isle of Axholme supported the Parliamentarians. Alleging that the Royalists would invade Axholme from the south, they broke down Misterton sluice and the Snow Sewer flood gates in 1642 or 1643, causing widespread flooding and damage estimated at £20,000. The Sheriff of Lincoln repaired both structures, but a band of 400 villagers destroyed them again. Legal action and rioting continued for some years. Nathaniel Reading, acting for the Participants, raised an 'army' in 1656, and fought a total of 31 pitched battles, including several against the men of Misterton and Gringley. It was not until 1719 that the issues were finally settled and peace returned to the area.|$|E
2500|$|Until the 17th century, {{the river}} flowed northwards {{from a place}} which {{subsequently}} became known as 'Idle Stop', across Hatfield Chase. To the west of Wroot, the River Torne formed two channels, both of which joined the Idle {{to the east of}} Wroot, and the Idle continued to join the River Don to the north west of Sandtoft. From Dirtness, the Don flowed to the north east, to Adlingfleet, where it joined the River Trent near to its confluence with the River Ouse. However, in 1626 the Dutch drainage engineer Cornelius Vermuyden was appointed by King Charles I to drain Hatfield Chase. Vermuyden brought over a number of Walloon partners, known as the Participants, who took shares and performed the drainage work, which was completed two years later. The Idle was affected by this work. Its course was blocked by a dam constructed at <b>Idle</b> <b>Stop,</b> and its waters were diverted along the Bycarrs Dyke, a Roman navigation channel, which joined the River Trent at West Stockwith. In order to isolate the river from Hatfield Chase, a barrier bank was constructed along the northern edge of this channel, for [...] from the dam to Stockwith. A navigable sluice was built about [...] from the river mouth at Misterton Soss by Vermuyden's nephew, John Liens, between 1629 and 1630, to prevent water from the Trent flooding the land to the south of Bycarrs Dike. The construction was of timber, with high banks running to the Trent {{on both sides of the}} channel. Lifting gates gave access to a lock chamber , which could be used when the Trent was not in flood. Liens was compelled to carry out the work by the Court of Sewers, to prevent the flooding of Misterton and Haxey Commons.|$|E

40|$|Study objective: {{the aim of}} {{the study}} was to analyse the victims and {{circumstances}} in carbon monoxide suicides from car exhausts in order to find strategies for mitigation of the suicide risk. Design: necropsy, police and hospital records were scrutinized for 194 victims who committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning from car exhausts during a four-year period in Sweden. Setting and participants: the State Institutes of Forensic Medicine in Umeå and Stockholm. Results: a higher incidence (24. 2 /million population) was seen in the rural region than in the urban region (14. 9). Males dominated (88 %), most of them middle aged. Most victims committed suicide in a car outdoors. A vacuum cleaner tube connected to the compartment was most commonly used. Severe disease, mostly psychiatric, was seen in 61 % of the victims. Drugs were detected in 8 % of the victims under psychiatric treatment. In 37 %, earlier suicide behaviour was documented. Suicide notes were found in 40 %. Blood alcohol was detected in 51 % of the victims and other drugs in 7 %. Conclusions: environmental changes may reduce the number of carbon monoxide suicides from car exhausts, e. g. introduction of a law requiring catalyst exhaust, of automatic <b>idling</b> <b>stop,</b> and of exhaust pipes incompatible with vacuum cleaner tubes.
