40|$|After a {{seagrass}} beds (Zostera noltii) colapse in 2008 of the Mira estuary (SW {{coast of}} Portugal) symptoms of early recovery were observed. The principal {{goal of this}} study is to assess the evolution and resilience of the benthic nematodes assemblages during the natural recovery of the seagrass beds through analysis of the spatial and temporal differences in structural and functional characteristics of the communities. The horizontal macroscale (km) and small scale (m) variability was evaluate. We hypothesize that the new environmental conditions of the early recovery, with sparsely distributed and small-sized seagrass patches, will increase the spatial heterogeneity of nematode communities and significantly affect community diversity, both taxonomic and functional. The sampling design was follows: Samples were collected in five “occasions”, (February, June, September, December 2010 and February 2011), at randomly “stations” located over a distance 50 m, at two “sites”, 2 km distance. To test the hypothesis that the composition of nematodes assemblages changes spatially and seasonally a two–way PERMANOVA analysis was performed. Mean nematode densities varied between 1416 ± 107 ind. 10 cm- 2 (Site A) and 2611 ± 230 ind. 10 cm- 2 (Site B), and a total of 89 species were identified. The PCO ordination based on abundance and composition of nematode genera do not shown the discrimination of the two sampling sites. However densities and trophic groups showed significant differences across <b>macroscale</b> (<b>sites</b> A and B), the increase of spatial heterogeneity was clear identified in small scale. No significant differences was observed between the temporal variation. The response of the nematode assemblages after the collapse, both in terms of density and diversity, showed a substantial potential of resilience and recovery...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{utilised}} the River Frome, Dorset, as a study catchment {{within which}} to examine the seasonal effects of large aquatic plants, or 'macrophytes', on hydraulic roughness, water velocity, river stage and fine sediment distribution. The thesis formed part of LOCAR, a NERC thematic research programme, and was motivated {{by the need to}} provide empirical data to improve river management and to help achieve a compromise between vegetation management for flood control and for maintaining and maximising biodiversity. The thesis employed a hierarchical research design with linked data collection at macro-, meso-, and microscales. (<b>i)</b> <b>Macroscale</b> research employed archival River Habitat Survey data and primary river surveys to place the more detailed meso- and microscale work in context. The analyses revealed the existence of a distinct chalk river group and examined the place of the River Frome within this. This provided contextual information to aid extrapolation of the current findings and facilitates comparisons with previous and future research. (ii) Mesoscale research focused upon stage and discharge measurements, and grid-based measurements of hydraulic variables. The analyses showed that macrophytes can have demonstrable and quantifiable effects on hydraulic roughness and sediment storage, which causes seasonal change in the stage/discharge relationship. However, this effect varies according to channel morphology and riparian land use and is subject to the attainment of a critical biomass. (iii) Microscale analyses employed high-frequency turbidity probes to investigate sediment processes within macrophyte beds. Each vegetation patch acted as a unique sediment filter, the characteristics of which changed over the growing season, and varied with distance along the patch. The results also suggested that retention of fine sediment is size selective and varies according to plant architecture and in-channel location. The thesis findings imply that vegetation management must be approached with greater sensitivity to reach scale and sub-reach characteristics.

40|$|Carbon Emissions Pinch Analysis (CEPA) is {{a recent}} {{extension}} of traditional thermal and mass pinch analysis {{to the area of}} emissions targeting and planning on a <b>macroscale</b> (<b>i.</b> e. economy wide). This paper presents a carbon pinch analysis of the New Zealand electricity industry and illustrates some of the issues with realising meaningful emissions reductions. The current large proportion of renewable generation sources (~ 67 % in 2007) complicates wholesale emissions reductions. The biggest growth in renewable generation is expected to come from geothermal energy followed by wind and hydro. A four fold increase in geothermal generation capacity is needed in addition to large amounts of new wind generation to reduce emissions to around 1990 levels and also meet projected demand. The expected expansion of geothermal generation in New Zealand raises issues of GHG emissions from the geothermal fields. The emissions factors between fields can vary by almost two orders of magnitude making predictions of total emissions highly site specific...|$|R

Long-term disease control will, however, require extensive, longitudinal surveillance systems capable of detecting (and dealing with) reinvasion-reinfestation of insecticide-treated dwellings by non-domiciliated triatomines. Sound surveillance design calls for reliable data on vector ecology, and these data must cover different spatial scales. We conducted a multi-scale assessment of ecological and evolutionary trends in members of the tribe Rhodniini, including (<b>i)</b> a <b>macroscale</b> analysis of Rhodniini species richness and composition patterns across the Americas, and (ii) a detailed, mesoscale case-study of ecological and behavioural trends in Rhodnius neglectus and R. nasutus. Our macroscale overviewprovides some comprehensive insights about key mechanisms/processes probably underlying ecological and genetic diversification in the Rhodniini. These insights translate {{into a series of}} testable hypotheses about current species distributions and their likely causes. At the landscape scale, we used geometric morphometrics to identify dubious specimens as either R. neglectus or R. nasutus (two near-sibling species), and studied palm tree populations of these two vector taxa in five geographical areas. The data suggest that deforestation and the associated loss of habitat and host diversity might increase the frequency of vector???human contact (and perhaps Trypanosoma cruzi infection rates in vectors). Surveillance in central-northeastern Brazil should prioritise deforested landscapes where large palm trees (e. g., Attalea, Mauritia, Copernicia, Acrocomia or Syagrus) occur near houses. We anticipate that, by helping define the distribution patterns and ecological preferences of each species, multi-scale research will significantly strengthen vector surveillance systems across Latin Americ...|$|R
40|$|Elastic wave {{scattering}} at {{grain boundaries}} in polycrystalline media {{can be quantified}} to determine microstructural properties. The amplitude drop observed for coherent wave propagation (attenuation) as well as diffuse-field scattering events (such as the single-scattering response) have been extensively studied. In all cases, the scattering shows a clear dependence on grain size, grain geometric morphology, and material texture (<b>i.</b> e., <b>macroscale</b> anisotropy). Scattering models used to quantify such scattering experiments are often developed under the assumption of a single effective grain diameter implying a very narrow distribution of grain size throughout the sample. However, several microscopy studies suggest that most metals have a log normal distribution of grain sizes with distribution widths as large as σ = 0. 75, where eσ represents the standard deviation of the distribution. In this presentation grain size distribution is discussed {{within the context of}} previous attenuation and single scattering response models. Results are presented for several example metals using reported experimental values of distribution means and widths assuming spherically-shaped grains and no material texture. The longitudinal and shear attenuations are shown to vary with respect to their frequency dependence for varying distribution widths even when the mean grain size is held constant. A similar effect is observed for diffuse ultrasonic backscatter (DUB) predictions. These results suggest that grain size estimates based on DUB can have large errors if the distribution is neglected. A multi-frequency analysis approach is discussed based on a log normal distribution in order to reduce grain size estimate errors. This work is anticipated {{to play an important role}} in microstructural characterization research associated with ultrasonic scattering...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Biology is {{becoming}} one of the most attractive fields of application of mathematics. The discoveries that have characterized the biological sciences in the last decades have become the most fertile matter for application of classical mathematical methods, while they offer a natural environment where new theoretical questions arise. Mathematical Biology has born many years ago and has developed along directions that now constitute its traditional background: population dynamics and reaction–diffusion equations. Nowadays Mathematical Biology is differentiating into several branches, es-sentially depending on the specific spatial scale size under consideration: molecular scale, i. e., DNA transcription, protein folding and cascades, cellular scale, i. e., motility, aggre-gation and morphogenesis, and <b>macroscale,</b> <b>i.</b> e., tissue mechanics. Currently one of the most attractive scientific topics is the mathematics of growth and remodelling of soft biological tissues. This area, located at the crossroads of biology, mathematics and con-tinuum mechanics, concerns the statement and analysis of the equations that characterize the mechanics, growth and remodelling of systems like arteries, tumors and ligaments, studied at the macroscopic scale. These are open continuous systems that pose new chal...|$|R
40|$|The size-specific {{burrowing}} {{capacity of}} Olivella semistriata, an extremely abundant surfing gastropod of exposed sandy beaches {{in the tropical}} East Pacific, was investigated in terms of sediment grain size. For all investigated sand classes, {{there was a significant}} increase in burial time with size. Burrowing was fastest in sand with grain size between 150 and 355 µm, as well as in native sediment (median grain size µm) and in field conditions (median grain size 223 µm). Values of the burrowing rate index (BRI) were found to be between 3 and 7, rating the burrowing capacity of O. semistriata to be fast to very fast. Data from previous qualitative and quantitative sampling campaigns were used to identify the <b>macroscale</b> (<b>i.</b> e., between beaches) distribution of O. semistriata in terms of sediment grain size and swash conditions. Swash period was shorter than burial time, excluding this as a factor limiting the distribution. Swash standstill time (the time between uprush and backwash), however, was just long enough on the beaches, where O. semistriata was present to allow for securing firm anchorage. On reflective beaches, the swash standstill time is as short as 1 or 2 s, denying O. semistriata the time to burry itself before being swept away by the backwash. As such, swash standstill time is advocated as a valuable part of the swash exclusion hypothesis. A survey of the available literature on the burrowing of surfers shows that mole crabs are by far the fastest burrowers and the only surfers that burrow sufficiently fast to withstand the extremely short swash standstill time on reflective beaches. Burrowing ability of surfing gastropods is found in the same range as surfing bivalves, both being insufficient to cope with coarse sediment on steep beaches. Finally, we suggest that neither burial time nor BRI, yet rather the minimal burial time-the time needed to anchor securely in a certain sand at a given swash velocity-should be used to judge the limitations of burial in terms of sediment and swash conditions...|$|R

Biodegradable polymers, such as poly-lactic acid (PLA), can degrade and erode upon hydrolysis. We aim to {{characterize}} these phenomena looking in particular at the mass transport. To this aim, {{we focus on}} the analysis of the diffusivity of water into the mixture and we model this phenomenon through two coupled modeling approaches. The macroscale method deals with the development of an advection-diffusion-reaction model for hydrolytic polymer degradation and erosion while the nanoscale method concerns the analysis of molecular diffusion of water into homogeneous polymer mixtures. First part (of two) - Macroscale Modeling. We introduce a general class of mixture models suitable to describe water-dependent degradation and erosion of biodegradable polymers in conjunction with drug release from such matrices. The model is based on a finite number of constituents describing the polydisperse polymeric system, each representing chains of an average size, and two additional constituents, water and drug. Hydrolytic degradation of individual chains occurs at the molecular level and mixture constituents diffuse individually accordingly to Fick's 1 st law at the bulk level. A shift between two different types of behavior, each identified to surface or bulk erosion, is observed with the variation of a single nondimensional parameter measuring the relative importance of the mechanisms of reaction and diffusion. Mass loss follows a sigmoid decrease in bulk eroding polymers, whereas decreases linearly in surface eroding polymers. Polydispersity influences degradation and erosion of bulk eroding polymers and drug release from unstable surface eroding matrices is dramatically enhanced in an erosion controlled release. Diffusion and reaction are the only physical mechanisms that need constitutive specification and once known, the model is closed and can be solved. Proposed constitutive relationships should depend on the particular polymeric system in question, and their specific forms must be asserted either from carefully designed experiments or from additional models. In the second part of this work, we carefully address the latter option. Second part (of two) - Nanoscale Modeling. We applied a protocol based on atomistic simulations in order to predict the water diffusion in PLA {{as a function of the}} swelling and degradation degree of the polymeric matrix. We generated atomistic models of PLA matrix with different degree of swelling (from â 0 % to 90 %) and different levels of degradation (from a degree of polymerization of 600 to a degree of polymerization of 1). We equilibrated and analyzed these models over molecular dynamics simulations of 7 ns. Finally the water diffusion coefficients was then obtained by tracking the mean square displacement of the water molecules and by applying the Einstein relation. Our preliminary results are in agreement with similar computational studies. The diffusion coefficient obtained at different swelling and degradation states of the matrix will be passed to the macroscale model, which in turn will model the degradation dynamics. Conclusions. The long term goal of this work is to set up the basis for a fully consistent regression-free multiscale model that combines nanoscale and macroscale methods in order to provide quantitative information about the physical properties of degradable polymeric systems, which will be useful in applications where the polymer represents the substrate for controlled drug release devices...|$|R
40|$|Waste heat {{recovery}} from the human body provides opportunities to power electronics with a source that is cheap and readily available. Thermoelectrics utilize the Seebeck effect to recover useable electrical energy from this waste heat, but are limited due to material parameters being inversely coupled in the bulk. We investigate the role of novel physics at interfaces {{in order to develop}} new fundamental understanding of thermoelectrics. The goal is to discover systems where the Seebeck coefficient and the electrical conductivity are not inversely correlated. We investigate thermoelectric transport in organic-organic systems such as scanning tunneling microscope molecular break junctions on the nanoscale, gold nanocrystal arrays on the mesoscale and polymeric ion and mixed conductors at the macroscale. The STM molecular junctions studied in this work can provide design rules to positively couple the Seebeck coefficient and the electrical conductance. Since STM molecular junctions are one-dimensional systems, by minimizing the gap between the molecular orbital energy level and the electrode Fermi energy, the power factor S 2 σ can be optimized. I built a toolbox of chemical structures by first understanding the role of the interface coupling to alkylthiol binding groups of thiophene-based molecules. With this understanding, I designed small molecules based on the monomer unit of donor-acceptor polymers and other conductive polymers. Molecules with very high HOMO levels or low LUMO levels were studied, and the corresponding energy levels were examined using spectroscopic techniques. I then present our work on scaling these molecular junctions to the macroscale using ligand-exchanged gold nanocrystal arrays. Beginning with a model system of alkanethiols and alkanedithiols, I show that the electrical conductivity scales with ligand length exactly as observed in single molecule junctions, and the Seebeck coefficient follows a similar trend. By showing that gold nanocrystal arrays are a good model platform to scale molecular junctions to the <b>macroscale,</b> <b>I</b> aim to bring the same Landauer transport physics observed in single molecule junctions to <b>macroscale</b> devices. <b>I</b> further investigate the role of different binding groups, where I find that the character of the ligand binding group directly affects whether the sign of the Seebeck coefficient of the overall array. Finally, I elaborate on our work with conductive polymers as thermoelectric materials, and specifically investigate the thermoelectric effect in polymers that are solely ion conductors or are capable of both ions and electrons transport. I demonstrate that thermoelectrics based ionic or mixed conduction can be well-described using the developed fundamental equations, and by using these rules we develop positive or negative Seebeck coefficient materials. I present our work on the newly developed thermoelectric AFM technique and how we use the thermoelectric response of different domains to understand the morphology of PEDOT:PSS. By fully understanding the thermoelectric properties of organic-inorganic hybrids from the monomer level, we can extend this same understanding to develop polymer thermoelectrics...|$|R
