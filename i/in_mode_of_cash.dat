40|$|This article {{discusses}} shifts <b>in</b> <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> governance <b>in</b> the Brazilian oil sector over a 60 -year period. On {{the basis}} of Driessen et al. 's (2012) framework, we discuss {{the impact of these}} shifts on sustainable development. Our results suggest that changes <b>in</b> <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> governance were driven by regulation and mostly associated with shifts in both actors and institutional features but that the underlying rationale of prioritising economic outcomes remained unaffected. The results also confirm that a central governance structure remained in place over time and co-existed <b>in</b> different <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> governance. Petrobras was the backbone of this structure and instrumental in empowering and disempowering non-state actors. This article stresses that a <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> governance furthering sustainable development should promote interactions of large numbers of actors and may require active participation of Petrobras to encourage rationales that support improvements in social and environmental domains...|$|R

Actually, because the generalized force <b>in</b> certain <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> the plate depends on the characteristic <b>of</b> the <b>mode</b> shape, the effective span of the cantilever pate could not be measured as plate side L_b but the wavelength <b>of</b> the <b>mode</b> shape <b>of</b> the track. It is noted from Eq. (13) that the wavelength <b>of</b> the <b>mode</b> shape <b>of</b> the track deceases with the increase <b>in</b> <b>mode</b> number n. As a result, no matter how long the plate side L_b is, the effective span of the plate, namely the wavelength of the modal shape, will become small enough <b>in</b> higher <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> vibration. Thus, significant periodical generalized exciting forces and resonance responses may occur <b>in</b> some higher <b>modes</b> <b>of</b> vibration of the cantilever deck.|$|R

We explore how transitions from a high uncertainty environment (reciprocal exchange) to lower-uncertainty environments (nonbinding or binding negotiated exchange) affect the level of trust among exchange partners. Our results show that if cooperation rates are high before and after a change <b>in</b> <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> exchange, trust declines when the uncertainty created by the <b>mode</b> <b>of</b> exchange decreases. Furthermore, we find that trust depends on both the amount of uncertainty inherent {{in the form of the}} exchange and the level of cooperation before and after the transition...|$|R
