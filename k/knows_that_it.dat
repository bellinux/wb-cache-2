5|$|In Katherine Buetow's {{guide to}} the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar {{makes the point that}} while people think of dog {{training}} as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll over, the dog already knows how to do these things. Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that {{it is a good idea}} to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do, and <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.|$|E
5|$|This rockfowl usually lives either {{alone or}} in pairs, {{although}} small flocks of three to ten birds are not uncommon. It normally moves through its habitat {{in a series of}} runs and long, springing hops on the ground and in low branches. It uses its tail for balance while hopping and running. When in a flock, rockfowl hop almost in unison. In the unusual occurrences when the species does fly, it is fast and is capable of navigating through the trees and rocks well. When it is standing still, the rockfowl has its tail down and its head looking up. Typically, it silently evades any unusual movements in their forest. However, if these birds know that they have been sighted, they can become quite inquisitive and occasionally approach observers. This is not a shy species once it <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> has been seen, and often studies things of interest, including humans, from an open location. When this species is suspicious, it raises the small crown on its head and the ruff on its neck while uttering a muffled groan. It is most active in the early morning and late evening, and from 10:30 am to 7:00 pm remains perched with little activity either in liana-tangled areas or in caves away from the nests. To scratch its head, the species lifts its foot over its head. It bathes in small pools. While its lifespan in the wild is unknown, it has lived up to 25 years in captivity.|$|E
25|$|To {{ensure that}} AED is working {{properly}} at all times, the D-Box telemetry device can be used.

In a situation when an AED has stopped working, the D-Box sends notifications {{and lets you}} discover problems before it’s too late.|$|E

After losing contact with Sephy, he works for the LM and helps them kidnap her. He, however, gets his old feelings back and ends up sleeping with her and then letting her escape. Callum is the father of Sephy's child, but he is hanged for his involvement in Sephy's kidnap before Callie Rose is born.|$|E
25|$|After World War II ended, and the Republic of China {{took over}} Taiwan, Lee {{enrolled}} in the National Taiwan University, where in 1948 he earned a bachelor's degree in agricultural science. Lee joined the Communist Party of China (CPC) for two stints, in September 1946 and October or November 1947, both times briefly. Lee began the New Democracy Association with four others. This group was absorbed by the CPC, and Lee officially left the party in September 1948. In a 2002 interview Lee himself {{admitted that he had}} been a Communist. In that same interview Lee said that he has strongly opposed Communism for a long time because he understands the theory well and <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is doomed to fail. Lee stated that he joined the Communists out of hatred for the KMT.|$|E
25|$|Asher's scars are {{hesitant}} {{around the}} face and groin, noted by Anita that {{it was as if}} the Priests flinched at the destruction of such beauty. The Priests (never said which denomination, but it is assumed Catholic) used Holy Water in an attempt to save Asher's soul (from what is never said, either). Asher is moody with a sadistic mean streak, lashing out at everyone in his fits of melancholic pain. He wants most to be loved and devoted by Jean-Claude, more a lover of men than women. Asher <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is through Anita's attraction to him combined with Jean-Claude's that Jean-Claude returns the love. Without Anita's acceptance, Jean-Claude could never bring himself to nearly be consumed for want of Asher again. That coupled with the incident of Asher nearly bleeding Anita to death during their first and only exclusive sexual experience leads to Asher's emotional neglect. Neither Anita nor Jean-Claude trust themselves alone with Asher, but as a trio, they live in nearly perfect love.|$|E

25|$|The {{moment of}} epiphany comes {{late in the}} play. At the {{beginning}} of Scene III, Oedipus is {{still waiting for the}} servant to be brought into the city, when a messenger arrives from Corinth to declare that King Polybus of Corinth is dead. Oedipus, when he hears this news, feels much relieved, because he believed that Polybus was the father whom the oracle had destined him to murder, and he momentarily believes himself to have escaped fate. He tells this all to the present company, including the messenger, but the messenger <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is not true. He is the man who found Oedipus as a baby in the pass of Cithaeron and gave him to King Polybus to raise. He reveals, furthermore that the servant who is being brought to the city as they speak is the very same man who took Oedipus up into the mountains as a baby. Jocasta realizes now all that has happened. She begs Oedipus not to pursue the matter further. He refuses, and she withdraws into the palace as the servant is arriving. The old man arrives, and it is clear at once that he knows everything. At the behest of Oedipus, he tells it all.|$|E
500|$|There {{are special}} cases, {{particularly}} {{when dealing with}} copying by third parties. If the person doing the copying {{is not the one}} doing the research, different rules apply; a publisher cannot use it to justify printing parts of other publishers works, as in Sillitoe v McGraw Hill, but in order to uphold the exception's justification, the courts do recognise that it can cover a research assistant making photocopies on behalf of a student or researcher. However, as a limitation, Section 29(3)(b) provides that the copying cannot be fair dealing if the person doing it <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> will result in [...] "copies of substantially the same material being provided to more than one person at substantially the same time and for substantially the same purpose". In other words, an academic cannot print off multiple copies of a work for students and then rely on the fair dealings exception.|$|E

[...] On the other hand, Republican Senator Karl Mundt called the story [...] "a filthy maneuver by left-wingers, fellow travelers, and former communists". Nixon issued a written statement explaining that the fund was to pay political expenses, in lieu of charging them to the taxpayer. Newspapers printed increasingly lurid accounts of the Fund and its beneficiary. The Sacramento Bee termed Nixon [...] "the pet protégé of a special interest group of rich southern Californians... their front man, if not, indeed, their lobbyist." [...] The Pasadena Star-News, meanwhile, reported that one contributor had been appealed to {{on the grounds that the}} Nixon family needed a larger home and could not afford a maid.|$|E

500|$|... "I Stay in Love" [...] is a [...] "beat-driven" [...] and [...] "piano-laced" [...] ballad, that is {{influenced}} by pop and R music genres. The song's instrumentation is derived from a piano melody, and is backed by a strong computerized drum-beat. It is composed in the key of D major, with Carey's vocals spanning from the low note of D3 to the high note of G5. The song moves at a slow tempo of 65 beats per minute in cut time, and it follows a chord progression of D–Bm7–G–A. [...] The song features a [...] "double voice" [...] effect during its final chorus, where Carey's normal singing tone {{throughout the rest of}} the song is combined with her raised pitch. She raises the pitch one octave, and layers it over her normal tone. Lyrically, the song finds Carey getting [...] "her cry on with the connect-the-dots break-up track." [...] She describes the old time she shared with her lover. She also admits that even though they did attempt to save their relationship, and that she <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is definitely over, she still [...] "stays in love with him".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Isaac Hempstead-Wright, who portrays Bran Stark in the series, Wright {{was asked about the}} significance of Bran witnessing the scene at the Tower of Joy, saying [...] "I don't think Bran knows why this is significant, but he <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is significant because he wouldn't have seen it if it wasn't earth-shattering, because everything we've learned so far during his visions has been pretty big and important, from the creation of the first White Walker to the origins of Hodor. This is clearly another important milestone in the history of Westeros. For Bran, he sat there sitting, 'This isn't my brother. This is my cousin somehow, but who's the dad? And why have I been shown this? If I find out who the dad is and why I need to know who the dad is, then let Jon know quick.'" [...] The scene reveals neither Lyanna Stark's son's name nor his father's, with the transition between the newborn's face and Jon Snow's visually conveying the identity. HBO released an infographic shortly after the episode aired, confirming Ned Stark as Jon's guardian, and Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen as his parents.|$|E
500|$|Sir Joseph {{comes on}} board, {{accompanied}} by his [...] "admiring crowd of sisters, cousins and aunts". He recounts how he rose from humble beginnings to be [...] "ruler of the Queen's Navee" [...] through persistence, although he has no naval qualifications. He then delivers a humiliating lesson in etiquette, telling the Captain that he must always say [...] "if you please" [...] after giving an order; for [...] "A British sailor is any man's equal" [...] – excepting Sir Joseph's. Sir Joseph has composed a song to illustrate that point, and he gives {{a copy of it}} to Ralph. Shortly afterwards, elated by Sir Joseph's views on equality, Ralph decides that he will declare his love to Josephine. This delights his shipmates, except Dick Deadeye, who contends that [...] "when people have to obey other people's orders, equality's out of the question". Shocked by his words, the other sailors force Dick to listen to Sir Joseph's song before they exit, leaving Ralph alone on deck. Josephine now enters, and Ralph confesses his love in terms surprisingly eloquent for a [...] "common sailor". Josephine is touched, but although she has found Sir Joseph's attentions nauseating, she <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is her duty to marry Sir Joseph instead of Ralph. Disguising her true feelings, she [...] "haughtily rejects" [...] Ralph's [...] "proffered love".|$|E

500|$|Music portal Dance Charts was {{positive}} towards the music video, although expressing that viewers may neglect the music when watching it. Echoing this thought, Hitfire further wrote {{that it is}} [...] "surely a contender for the hottest video of the year". While German magazine Klatsch-Tratsch noticed [...] "much charm, naked skin and great moves" [...] in the visual, Kevin Apaza of Direct Lyrics pointed out Inna [...] "flaunting that smokin' hot body of hers as she soaks up the sun at the beach, [...] wet in a lake and [...] sensual choreographies." [...] Website MuuMuse wrote that the visual is [...] "quite important for showcasing Inna's ferocious moves and luscious assets, including her Coca-Cola shape — and especially her Coca-Cola shake", and French publications Purebreak and Pure People noticed Inna's [...] "suggestive" [...] and [...] "lascivious" [...] posing in bathing suits. Portal Cosmopolitan Staragora compared the music video to Inna's previous material, as the singer [...] "appears little dressed in paradisiac landscapes: ocean blue lagoon, sunset, fine white sand, pretty girls [...] ". Spanish website Jukebox wrote that the singer [...] " [...] the similarity between her curvilinear forms and those of a bottle of Coca-Cola. It is not clear if it is an advertising for the drink or not, {{but there is no}} doubt that this fresh and summery video promotes the consumption of the soft drink", alongside stating that Inna [...] "shines in trikini" [...] and [...] "dances in purest Latin style". Music portal Musicserver was more negative towards the clip; although stating that it [...] "probably will please the male fanbase", the website concluded that, [...] "Everyone already <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is sexy, so why offering the same for the tenth time?" [...] The music video received a nomination for Best Video at the Romanian Music Awards gala in 2014.|$|E
500|$|Hitchens writes [...] "the biggest fake miracle {{staged in}} human history was {{the claim that the}} Soviet Union was a new {{civilisation}} of equality, peace, love, truth, science and progress. Everyone <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a prison, a slum, a return to primitive barbarism, a kingdom of lies where scientists and doctors feared offending the secret police, and that its elite were corrupt and lived in secret luxury". He then cites Walter Duranty's denying the existence of the great Ukrainian famine, and Sidney and Beatrice Webb's [...] acceptance that the 1937 Moscow show trials were [...] "genuine criminal prosecutions". Hitchens then examines Lenin's suppression of religion in the Soviet Union, which included making the teaching of religion to children punishable by the death penalty and the creation of an antireligious organisation of Soviet workers. Hitchens begins Chapter 13 by quoting William Henry Chamberlin: [...] "In Russia, the world is witnessing the first effort to destroy completely any belief in supernatural interpretation of life", and then examines some consequences of this, including intolerance of religion, terror, and the persecution of priests and bishops at the Solovetsky concentration camp. Hitchens asserts that in the Soviet Union [...] "the regime's institutional loathing for the teaching of religion, and its desire to eradicate it, survived every doctrinal detour and swerve". In the final chapter, Hitchens analyses a number of his brother's arguments, and contends that [...] "the coincidence in instinct, taste, and thought between my brother and the Bolsheviks and their sympathisers is striking and undeniable". He then records how his brother nominated the [...] "apostle of revolutionary terror" [...] Leon Trotsky for an edition of the BBC radio series Great Lives; praised Trotsky for his [...] "moral courage"; and declared that one of Lenin's great achievements was [...] "to create a secular Russia". Hitchens speculates that his brother remained sympathetic towards Bolshevism and is still hostile towards the things it extirpated, including monarchy, tradition, and faith. He ends the chapter by claiming a form of militant secularism is becoming established in Britain, and that [...] "The Rage Against God is loose".|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Smile" [...] is a bubbly, mid-tempo {{tune with}} [...] "a barroom piano lick", subdued horns and a reggae beat, {{singing in a}} light falsetto, while the organ riff {{contains}} a sample of Jackie Mittoo playing keyboards on the 1960s rocksteady song [...] "Free Soul" [...] by The Soul Brothers, also written by Mittoo. He and Clement Dodd received credit on the song as co-writers. It was described to have a [...] "cod-reggae groove that smoulders like a barbecue", as a guitar and piano {{were used for the}} background music, following the notes Gm—F as its basic chord progression. It is set in the time signature of common time, having a metronome of 96 beats per minute, and is played in the key of F major. Lyrically, the song describes Allen's satisfaction in her former lover's suffering, being in a vengeful mood: [...] "At worst / I feel bad for a while, / But then I just smile / I go ahead and smile," [...] thus creating a contrast between [...] "the peppy melody and brassy lyrics". The inspiration for the song came from a real life experience, when Allen broke up with her then boyfriend, Lester Lloyd, resulting in a drug overdose and hospitalization for her depression. The singer claimed [...] "I started to get depressed and anyone who suffers from depression <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> can soon get so bad that you can't get out of bed. It was then that I checked into the Priory. That was really tough as I was an emotional mess. [...] The lyrics are definitely bitter-sweet". Allen said she later regretted the direct approach of her lyrics: I'm now less inclined to do that, because everything that I do say gets repeated in a way that I haven't said it, or taken out of context and spun in some negative way — and it makes me really sad. I'm not, like, a negative person. I'm actually quite positive, but this industry has really made me feel angry and negative recently. I'm not enjoying it at the moment.|$|E
