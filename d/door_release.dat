However Village Roadshow Theme Parks, owner of competitor Wet'n'Wild Gold Coast, attempted to negotiate an exclusivity agreement with the manufacturer. Three months later in February 2010, it was announced that WhiteWater World would build an alternative attraction built by ProSlide before the April school holidays. The Wedgie, the first ProSlide Superloop, opened on 1 April 2011. It was the first ride in Australia to feature a trap <b>door</b> <b>release</b> and was marketed as Australia's first looping water slide.|$|E
5|$|When the glider was {{carrying}} tanks or other vehicles, common practice was that their engines would be {{started in the}} air, usually {{just prior to the}} glider casting off from the tug; special exhaust ducts were fitted to the glider to expel exhaust fumes. The Tetrarch and M22 Locust light tanks were so large that they barely fit inside the glider, and as such their crews stayed inside the tank {{for the duration of the}} flight. Once the glider landed, the anchorages keeping the vehicle stationary would be released by the driver pulling a lanyard within his reach, and the driver would then drive the tank forward, which automatically pulled a line that operated the swing <b>door</b> <b>release.</b> Universal Carriers and other vehicles relied on one of the pilots operating the door line manually. This was achieved by the pilot sliding down the fuselage and then dropping to the ground. They would then go to each undercarriage leg and release the valves there, which would expel hydraulic fluid and allow the shock absorbers struts to deflate, and then enter the glider and operate the <b>door</b> <b>release</b> line. If the swing door was jammed after the glider had landed, it was possible for tanks to break through the unopened forward fuselage and drive straight out of the glider, which occurred in both airborne operations where Hamilcars transported tanks.|$|E

25|$|All DT3 {{units are}} {{equipped}} with passenger intercom panels near every door {{in addition to the}} standard emergency brakes and emergency <b>door</b> <b>release</b> handles. Controllers can access CCTV cameras in every unit from the control centre through a Wireless LAN link installed in all tunnels that are used by DT3 trains. Flame-retardant materials are used wherever possible. Temperature sensors and smoke detectors are spread throughout every unit in the passenger space and in every underfloor machinery compartment to detect possible fires as early as possible. Circuit integrity retaining electrical cables (cables that can keep their insulation for a certain time in the presence of fire) are used to allow a unit to proceed to the next station in case of a fire. German regulations mandate that all subway trains must not stop inside a tunnel after the emergency brake has been pulled or if any other hazard like a fire is detected, but instead should proceed to the next station if possible to ease rescue operations. Since the longest travel time between two stations on the Nuremberg U-Bahn is about 3 Minutes (between Ziegelstein and Flughafen) and most stations are less than 60 seconds apart, this is deemed a superior option to stopping inside a tunnel, where evacuation, rescue and firefighting attempts would be much more difficult than on a station platform.|$|E

50|$|The entire train {{composition}} from was designed {{the beginning to}} be operated by one man. Therefore, all doors are equipped with a pneumatic door locking feature that can be operated from the cab (side selective <b>door</b> <b>release).</b> The doors have push button pre-selection keys adjacent to them. They also have a door closure system that closes the doors automatically when the vehicle starts moving, and keeps them closed while driving.|$|E
50|$|When first introduced, the T {{sets were}} fitted with {{passenger}} <b>door</b> <b>release</b> handles to prevent loss of air conditioning at stations. These were later disconnected (and later removed) due to passengers not {{getting used to}} opening the doors for themselves when needed. The seats originally had fabric upholstery, but this was gradually replaced by blue vinyl. They were also fitted with front destination displays although these have rarely worked.|$|E

In other markets, manual transmission models retained a swing axle independent suspension which would continue until the end of German Beetle production.|$|E
50|$|The {{doors were}} {{extremely}} heavy, and when opening them great care {{had to be}} taken that the latch engaged the top of the door. The doors were spring-loaded and if the springs were strong the doors would close immediately. On the inside, the driver and passenger both had <b>door</b> <b>release</b> pads located above the door openings. All one had to do to close the door was hit the pad and the door would slam shut.|$|E
50|$|Rescue {{workers who}} {{attended}} the scene were impeded from accessing the trapped passengers on the train {{because they did not}} have the keys required to open the emergency exit doors. Emergency exit mechanisms have all been modified, to allow them to be used without requiring a key. RailCorp has installed internal emergency <b>door</b> <b>release</b> mechanisms on all the new trains. However many passengers found their own way out since the train was broken into 3 pieces during the accident.|$|E

50|$|A {{mechanical}} {{fusible link}} is a device {{consisting of two}} strips of metal soldered together with a fusible alloy {{that is designed to}} melt at a specific temperature, thus allowing the two pieces to separate. Mechanical fusible links are utilized as the triggering device in fire sprinkler systems and mechanical automatic <b>door</b> <b>release</b> mechanisms that close fire doors in warehouses, etc. Some high-security safes also utilize fusible link-based relockers as a defense against torches and heat-producing tools. Mechanical fusible links {{come in a variety of}} designs and different temperature ratings.|$|E
50|$|As built, {{the sliding}} doors were opened by the passengers. Once {{the driver had}} stopped the train and the guard had {{activated}} the master <b>door</b> <b>release,</b> a passenger could move the door handle gently sideways which operated a switch controlling the individual door opening circuit. Many people did not wait for the guard's release and gave the handle a much harder tug, which could open the door even if the train had not stopped. Concerns over passenger safety led to the handles being replaced by push-buttons from March 1977.|$|E
