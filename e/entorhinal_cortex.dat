5|$|The {{input to}} the {{hippocampus}} (from varying cortical and subcortical structures) {{comes from the}} <b>entorhinal</b> <b>cortex</b> via the perforant path. The <b>entorhinal</b> <b>cortex</b> (EC) is strongly and reciprocally connected with many cortical and subcortical structures {{as well as with}} the brainstem. Different thalamic nuclei, (from the anterior and midline groups), the medial septal nucleus, the supramamillary nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus of the brainstem all send axons to the EC, so that it serves as the interface between the neocortex and the other connections, and the hippocampus.|$|E
5|$|The perforant path is {{the main}} output pathway of the <b>entorhinal</b> <b>cortex</b> (EC). The flow of {{information}} in the hippocampus is largely unidirectional. Axons from the pyramidal cells (in EC layer II) perforate the subiculum to project mainly to the granular layer in the dentate gyrus (first synaptic connection). Some axons project to CA3 and a lesser number project to CA1. The dentate granule cell axons, called mossy fibers, pass on the information, to the dendrites of CA3 pyramidal cells (second synaptic connection). From there, CA3 axons called Schaffer collaterals leave the deep part of the cell body and loop up to the apical dendrites and then extend to CA1. Axons from CA1 then project back to the <b>entorhinal</b> <b>cortex</b> (third synaptic connection) completing the trisynaptic loop or circuit.|$|E
5|$|The term hippocampal {{formation}} {{is used to}} refer to the hippocampus proper and its related parts. However, there is no consensus as to what parts are included. Sometimes the hippocampus is said to include the dentate gyrus and the subiculum. Some references include the dentate gyrus and the subiculum in the hippocampal formation, and others also include the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and <b>entorhinal</b> <b>cortex.</b> The neural layout and pathways within the hippocampal formation are very similar in all mammals.|$|E
40|$|The {{hippocampus}} receives two {{streams of}} information, spatial and nonspatial, via major afferent inputs from the medial (MEC) and lateral <b>entorhinal</b> <b>cortexes</b> (LEC). The MEC and LEC projections in the temporoammonic pathway are topographically organized along the transverse-axis of area CA 1. The potential for functional segregation of area CA 1, however, remains relatively unexplored. Here, we demonstrated differential novelty-induced c-Fos expression along the transverse-axis of area CA 1 corresponding to topographic projections of MEC and LEC inputs. We found that, while novel place exposure induced a uniform c-Fos expression along the transverse-axis of area CA 1, novel object exposure primarily activated the distal half of CA 1 neurons. In hippocampal slices, we observed distinct presynaptic properties between LEC and MEC terminals, {{and application of}} either DA or NE produced a largely selective influence on one set of inputs (LEC). Finally, we demonstrated that differential c-Fos expression along the transverse axis of area CA 1 was largely abolished by an antagonist of neuromodulatory receptors, clozapine. Our results suggest that neuromodulators can control topographic TA projections allowing the hippocampus to differentially encode new information along the transverse axis of area CA 1...|$|R
40|$|Functional {{roles of}} the {{cortical}} backward signal in long-term memory formation were studied in monkeys performing a visual pair-association task. Before the monkeys learned the task, the anterior commissure was transected, disconnecting the anterior temporal cortex of each hemisphere. After training with 12 pairs of pictures, single units were recorded from the inferotemporal cortex of the monkeys as the control. By injecting a grid of ibotenic acid, we unilaterally lesioned the <b>entorhinal</b> and perirhinal <b>cortex,</b> which provides massive direct and indirect backward projections ipsilaterally to the inferotemporal cortex. After the lesion, the monkeys fixated the cue stimulus normally, relearned the preoperatively learned set (set A), and learned a new set (set B) of paired associates. Then, single units were recorded from the same area as for the prelesion control. We found that (i) {{in spite of the}} lesion, the sampled neurons responded strongly and selectively to both the set A and set B patterns and (ii) the paired associates elicited significantly correlated responses in the control neurons before the lesion but not in the cells tested after the lesion, either for set A or set B stimuli. We conclude that the ability of inferotemporal neurons to represent association between picture pairs was lost after the lesion of <b>entorhinal</b> and perirhinal <b>cortex,</b> most likely through disruption of backward neural signals to the inferotemporal neurons, while the ability of the neurons to respond to a particular visual stimulus was left intact...|$|R

In the social transmission of food preference test, 3 x Tg-AD mice presented severe deficits in odor-based memory, without gross changes in general odor-ability. A beta and tau immunoreactivity {{was not observed}} in the primary processing regions for odor, the olfactory bulbs (OBs), whereas marked immunostaining was present in the piriform, <b>entorhinal,</b> and orbitofrontal <b>cortex,</b> {{as well as in}} the hippocampus.

40|$|Four emotionally arousing stimuli {{were used}} to probe the {{behavior}} of monkeys with bilateral ablations of the <b>entorhinal</b> and perirhinal <b>cortex.</b> The animals' behavioral changes were then contrasted with those observed earlier (Meunier et al., 1999) in monkeys with either neurotoxic or aspiration lesions of the neighboring amygdala. Rhinal cortex ablations yielded several subtle behavioral changes, {{but none of them}} resembled any of the disorders typically seen after amygdalectomies. The changes produced by rhinal damage took mainly the form of heightened defensiveness, and attenuated submission and approach responses, that is, just the opposite {{of some of the most}} distinctive symptoms following amygdala damage. These findings raise the possibility that the rhinal cortex and amygdala have distinct, interactive, functions in normal behavioral adaptation to affective stimuli...|$|R
40|$|Research {{in humans}} and monkeys has {{demonstrated}} {{a system of}} anatomically related structures in the medial temporal lobe that is important for memory function. This system is comprised of the hippocampal region (i. e., the dentate gyrus, hippocampus proper and subicular complex) and the entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices. While the hippocampal region has long been thought {{to be important in}} memory, there are few systematic studies in primates of the effects on memory of damage limited to the hippocampal region. We have used magnetic resonance imaging techniques, together with a stereotaxic approach, to produce bilateral lesions limited to the hippocampal region (the H lesion). Damage to the adjacent perirhinal, <b>entorhinal,</b> and parahippocampal <b>cortex</b> was minimal. Monkeys with the H lesion exhibited significan...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{hippocampus}} {{is assumed}} to retrieve memory byÂ reinstating patterns of cortical activity that were observed during learning. To test this idea, we monitored the activity of individual cortical neurons while simultaneously inactivating the hippocampus. Neurons that were active during context fear conditioning were tagged with the long-lasting fluorescent protein H 2 B-GFP and the light-activated proton pump ArchT. These proteins allowed us to identify encoding neurons several days after learning and silence them with laser stimulation. When tagged CA 1 cells were silenced, we found that memory retrieval was impaired and representations in the <b>cortex</b> (<b>entorhinal,</b> retrosplenial, perirhinal) and the amygdala could not be reactivated. Importantly, hippocampal inactivation did not alter {{the total amount of}} activity in most brain regions. Instead, it selectively prevented neurons that were active during learning from being reactivated during retrieval. These data provide functional evidence that the hippocampus reactivates specific memory representations during retrieval...|$|R
25|$|The <b>entorhinal</b> <b>cortex</b> {{contributes}} to the processing and integration of geometric properties and information in the environment. Lesions to this region impair the use of distal but not proximal landmarks during navigation and produces a delay-dependent deficit in spatial memory that {{is proportional to the}} length of the delay. Lesions to this region are also known to create retention deficits for tasks learned up to 4 weeks but not 6 weeks prior to the lesions.|$|E
25|$|The {{orbitofrontal cortex}} (OFC) {{represents}} the main neocortical target of primary olfactory cortex. In non-human primates, the olfactory neocortex is situated along the basal {{surface of the}} caudal frontal lobes, encompassing agranular and dysgranular OFC medially and agranular insula laterally, where this latter structure wraps onto the posterior orbital surface. Direct afferent inputs arrive from most primary olfactory areas, including piriform cortex, amygdala, and <b>entorhinal</b> <b>cortex,</b> {{in the absence of}} an obligatory thalamic relay.|$|E
25|$|Neural oscillations, in {{particular}} theta activity, are extensively linked to memory function. Theta rhythms {{are very strong}} in rodent hippocampi and <b>entorhinal</b> <b>cortex</b> during learning and memory retrieval, and they {{are believed to be}} vital to the induction of long-term potentiation, a potential cellular mechanism for learning and memory. Coupling between theta and gamma activity is thought to be vital for memory functions, including episodic memory. Tight coordination of single-neuron spikes with local theta oscillations is linked to successful memory formation in humans, as more stereotyped spiking predicts better memory.|$|E
40|$|To {{test whether}} the rhinal <b>cortex</b> (i. e., <b>entorhinal</b> and perirhinal <b>cortex)</b> plays a time-limited role in {{information}} storage, eight rhesus monkeys {{were trained to}} criterion on two sets of 60 object discrimination problems, one set at each of two different time periods separated by 15 weeks. After the monkeys had learned both sets, two groups balanced for preoperative acquisition rates were formed. One group received bilateral ablation of the rhinal cortex (n ï¿½ 4), {{and the other was}} retained as an unoperated control group (n ï¿½ 4). After a 2 week rest period, monkeys were assessed for retention of the object discrimination problems. Retention was significantly poorer in monkeys with removals of the rhinal cortex relative to the controls (68 vs 91 %).

40|$|Cortical fast-spiking (FS) neurons {{generate}} high-frequency action potentials (APs) without apparent frequency accommodation, {{thus providing}} fast and precise inhibition. However, the maximal firing frequency {{that they can}} reach, particularly in primate neocortex, remains unclear. Here, by recording in human, monkey and mouse neocortical slices, we revealed that FS neurons in human association cortices (mostly temporal) could generate APs at a maximal mean frequency (Fmean) of 338 Hz and a maximal instantaneous frequency (Finst) of 453 Hz, and they increase with age. The maximal firing frequency of FS neurons in the association cortices (frontal and temporal) of monkey was even higher (Fmean 450 Hz, Finst 611 Hz), whereas in the association <b>cortex</b> (<b>entorhinal)</b> of mouse it was much lower (Fmean 215 Hz, Finst 342 Hz). Moreover, FS neurons in mouse primary visual cortex (V 1) could fire at higher frequencies (Fmean 415 Hz, Finst 582 Hz) than those in association cortex. We further validated our in vitro data by examining spikes of putative FS neurons in behaving monkey and mouse. Together, our results demonstrate that the maximal firing frequency of FS neurons varies between species and cortical areas...|$|R
40|$|Adult neonatally y-irradiated rats were {{compared}} with control animals in a non-spatial olfactory associative task using two different procedures. Irradiation induced a clear reduction in the total mean area of the olfactory bulbs and hippocampus but not of the orbital prefrontal cortex, diagonal band and cell layers of the <b>entorhinal</b> and piriform <b>cortex.</b> The y-irradiation affected the granule cells of the olfactory bulbs and differentially altered the cell layers of the subfields of the ammonic fields and the dorsal and ventral blades of the dentate gyrus. In the CA 1 arnmonic field, dorsal and ventral blades of the dentate gyrus, the cellular loss was significant in comparison with control adult rats. The behavioural data indicated that irradiated rats were deeply disturbed in learning the odour-reward association, and substantially impaired in a reversal experiment, {{but not in the}} discrimination of the odours per se. The cellular loss in the olfactory bulbs, in the CA 1 and in the ventral blade of the gyrus dentatus was positively correlated with the deficit in behavioural performance. The data support the findings that the hippocampal system participates in the odour-reward associations and facilitates the long-term storage of associations after learning is achieved in this olfactory associative task...|$|R
25|$|Impairments in impulse {{control in}} binge drinkers, {{which is more}} {{prominent}} in female binge drinkers, is due to dysfunction of the frontal lobe. The findings in humans have been largely concordant with animal studies. Such animal studies find that heavy and regular binge drinking causes neurodegeneration in corticolimbic brain regions areas {{that are involved in}} learning and spatial memory, such as the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, perirhinal cortex, <b>entorhinal</b> <b>cortex,</b> and the hippocampal dentate gyrus. A study in rats found that a heavy 2-day drinking binge caused extensive neurodegeneration in the <b>entorhinal</b> <b>cortex</b> with resultant learning deficits. While brain damage from binge drinking is known to occur as a result of binge drinking patterns, it is unclear how long drinking sessions last and how regular binge drinking is done to cause brain damage in humans. One study found that humans who drank at least 100 drinks (male) or 80 drinks (female) per month (concentrated to 21 occasions or less per month) throughout a 3-year period had impaired decision making skills compared to non-binge drinkers. Repeated acute withdrawal from alcohol, which occurs in heavy binge drinkers, has been shown in several studies to be associated with cognitive deficits as a result of neural kindling; neural kindling due to repeated withdrawals {{is believed to be the}} mechanism of cognitive damage in both binge drinkers and alcoholics. Neuronal kindling also leads to each subsequent acute withdrawal episode being more severe than previous withdrawal episodes.|$|E
25|$|Spatial cues such as {{geometric}} boundaries or orienting landmarks {{are important}} examples of metric input. Place cells mainly rely on set distal cues rather than cues {{in the immediate}} proximal environment. Movement can also be an important spatial cue. The ability of place cells to incorporate new movement information is called path integration, {{and it is important}} for keeping track of self-location during movement. Path integration is largely aided by grid cells, which are a type of neuron in the <b>entorhinal</b> <b>cortex</b> that relay information to place cells in the hippocampus. Grid cells establish a grid representation of a location, so that during movement place cells can fire according to their new location while orienting according to the reference grid of their external environment. Visual sensory inputs can also supply important contextual information. A change in color of a specific object can affect whether or not a place cell fires in a particular field. Thus, visuospatial sensory information is critical to the formation and recollection of place field.|$|E
25|$|Sensory {{information}} {{received by}} place cells {{can be categorized}} as either metric or contextual information, where metric information corresponds to where place cells should fire and contextual input corresponds {{to whether or not}} a place field should fire in a certain environment. Metric sensory information is any kind of spatial input that might indicate a distance between two points. For example, the edges of an environment might signal the size of the overall place field or the distance between two points within a place field. Metric signals can be either linear or directional. Directional inputs provide information about the orientation of a place field, whereas linear inputs essentially form a representational grid. Contextual cues allow established place fields to adapt to minor changes in the environment, such as a change in object color or shape. Metric and contextual inputs are processed together in the <b>entorhinal</b> <b>cortex</b> before reaching the hippocampal place cells. Visuospatial and olfactory inputs are examples of sensory inputs that are utilized by place cells. These types of sensory cues can include both metric and contextual information.|$|E
40|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is {{characterized}} by deposits of aggregated proteins. Accumulation of aggregation-prone proteins activates protein quality control mechanisms, such as the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We previously reported upregulation of the UPR marker BiP in AD brain. In this study, we investigated the small GTPase Rab 6, which is involved in retrograde Golgi-ER trafficking and may function as a post-ER quality control system. Using immunohistochemistry and semiquantitative Western blotting, the expression of Rab 6 was analysed in hippocampus, <b>entorhinal</b> and temporal <b>cortex</b> of 10 AD patients and six nondemented control subjects. Rab 6 is upregulated in AD temporal cortex from Braak stage 3 / 4, the same stage that UPR activation is found. We observe increased neuronal Rab 6 immunoreactivity in all brain areas examined. Although some neurones show colocalization of immunoreactivity for Rab 6 and hyperphosphorylated tau, strong Rab 6 staining does not colocalize with tangles. We find a highly significant correlation between the Rab 6 and BiP levels. In vitro data show that Rab 6 is not upregulated {{as a result of}} UPR activation or proteasome inhibition indicating an independent regulatory mechanism. Our data suggest that ER and post-ER protein quality control mechanisms are activated early in the pathology of A...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the {{structural}} organisation of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) {{is an important}} step towards determining its functional organisation. Here we investigated the organisation of PFC using different neuronal tracers. We injected retrograde (Fluoro-Gold, 100 nl) and anterograde (Biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) or Fluoro-Ruby, 100 nl) tracers into sites within PFC subdivisions (prelimbic, ventral orbital, ventrolateral orbital, dorsolateral orbital) along a coronal axis within PFC. At each injection site one injection was made of the anterograde tracer and one injection was made of the retrograde tracer. The projection locations of retrogradely labelled neurons and anterogradely labelled axon terminals were then analysed in the temporal cortex: area Te, <b>entorhinal</b> and perirhinal <b>cortex.</b> We found evidence for an ordering of both the anterograde (anterior-posterior, dorsal-ventral and medial-lateral axes: p< 0. 001) and retrograde (anterior-posterior, dorsal-ventral and medial-lateral axes: p< 0. 001) connections of PFC. We observed that anterograde and retrograde labelling in ipsilateral temporal cortex (i. e. PFC inputs and outputs) often occurred reciprocally (i. e. the same brain region, such as area 35 d in perirhinal cortex, contained anterograde and retrograde labelling). However, often the same specific columnar temporal cortex regions contained only either labelling of retrograde or anterograde tracer, indicating that PFC inputs and outputs are frequently non-matched...|$|R
40|$|The medial {{temporal}} lobe is indispensable for normal memory processing in {{both human and}} non-human primates, as is shown {{by the fact that}} large lesions in it produce a severe impairment in the acquisition of new memories. The widely accepted inference from this observation is that the medial temporal cortex, including the hippocampal, <b>entorhinal</b> and perirhinal <b>cortex,</b> contains a memory system or multiple memory systems, which are specialized for the acquisition and storage of memories. Nevertheless, there are some strong arguments against this idea: medial temporal lesions produce amnesia by disconnecting the entire temporal cortex from neuromodulatory afferents arising in the brainstem and basal forebrain, not by removing cortex; the temporal cortex is essential for perception as well as for memory; and response properties of temporal cortical neurons make it impossible that some kinds of memory trace could be stored in the {{temporal lobe}}. All cortex is plastic, and {{it is possible that the}} same rules of plasticity apply to all cortical areas; therefore, memory traces are stored in widespread cortical areas rather than in a specialized memory system restricted to the temporal lobe. Among these areas, the prefrontal cortex has an important role in learning and memory, but is best understood as an area with no specialization of function...|$|R
500|$|There {{are several}} navigational {{cells in the}} brain that are either in the {{hippocampus}} itself or are strongly connected to it, such as the speed cells present in the medial <b>entorhinal</b> <b>cortex.</b> Together these cells form a network that serves as spatial memory. The first of such cells discovered in the 1970s were the place cells, {{which led to the}} idea of the hippocampus acting to give a neural representation of the environment in a cognitive map. When the hippocampus is dysfunctional, orientation is affected; people may have difficulty in remembering how they arrived at a location and how to proceed further. Getting lost is a common symptom of amnesia. Studies with animals have shown that an intact hippocampus is required for initial learning and long-term retention of some spatial memory tasks, in particular ones that require finding the way to a hidden goal. Other cells have been discovered since the finding of the place cells in the rodent brain that are either in the hippocampus or the <b>entorhinal</b> <b>cortex.</b> These have been assigned as head direction cells, grid cells and boundary cells.

Males demonstrated increased leftward asymmetry within Heschlâs gyrus and PT compared to females. There was no significant interaction between asymmetry and handedness and no main effect of handedness. There was a significant main effect of sex on brain morphology, even after accounting for the larger global volumes of grey and white matter in males. Females had increased grey matter volume adjacent to the depths of both central sulci and the left superior temporal sulcus, in right Heschlâs gyrus and PT, in right inferior frontal and frontomarginal gyri and in the cingulate gyrus. Females had significantly increased grey matter concentration extensively and relatively symmetrically in the cortical mantle, parahippocampal gyri, and in the banks of the cingulate and calcarine sulci.

40|$|Neurodegenerative {{diseases}} such as Parkinson's disease (PD), frontal lobe dementia (FLD) and Diffuse Lewy-Body dementia (DLBD) have diverse neuropathologic features. Here we report that serotonin fibers are dystrophic in the brains of individuals with these three diseases. In neuropathologically normal (control) brains (n= 3), serotonin axons immunoreactive (IR) with antibodies against the serotonin transporter (5 -HTT) protein were widely distributed in <b>cortex</b> (<b>entorhinal</b> and dorsolateral prefrontal), hippocampus and rostral brainstem. 5 -HTT-IR fibers of passage appeared thick, smooth, and un-branched in medial forebrain bundle, medial lemniscus and cortex white matter. The terminal branches were fine, highly branched and varicose in substantia nigra, hippocampus and cortical gray matter. In the diseased brains, however, 5 -HTT-IR fibers in the forebrain were reduced in number and were frequently bulbous, splayed, tightly clustered and enlarged. Morphometric analysis revealed {{significant differences in the}} size distribution of the 5 -HTT-IR profiles in dorsolateral prefrontal area between neurodegenerative diseases and controls.

Using quantitative image analysis of coronal phosphotyrosine-immunostained sections, transgene-positive 10 - to 16 -month-old, hemizygous, hybrid Tg 2576 (APPsw) animals showed significantly increased microglial density and size in plaque-forming areas of hippocampus and frontal, <b>entorhinal,</b> and occipital <b>cortex.</b> Quantitative analysis of microglia as a function of distance from the center of plaques (double labeled for A beta peptide and microglia) revealed highly significant, two- to fivefold elevations in microglial number and area within plaques compared with neighboring regions. Tg 2576 beta-amyloid-plaque-forming mice should be a useful system for assessing the consequences of the microglial-mediated inflammatory response to beta-amyloid and developing anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease.

However, these observations do not indicate where permanentmemory is stored, nor do they clarify whether the hippocampus normally remains involved in a nonessential way. Evidence from multiple neural imaging studies indicate the time-limited role of the hippocampus and suggest that the anterior cingulate cortex is a critical storage site {{of different types of}} long-term memory. However, each of the previous studies examined spatial memory, leaving open the question of whether different cortical areas support long-term memory for other types ofmaterial. We characterized the course of involvement of cortical and hippocampal areas in animals trained in an explicitlynonspatial task. First, we confirmed previous findings that hippocampal damage produces temporally graded retrogradeamnesia for the social transmission of a food preference (STFP) within our experimental protocol. Damage to thehippocampal region 1 d, but not 21 d, after training impaired subsequent recall of STFP. Then, we characterized theanatomical patterns of activation of the immediate early gene c-fos during retrieval of STFP immediately and 1, 2, and 21 dafter training. The ventral subiculum was activated during retrieval shortly after learning, but the level of activation declined at successive times. In contrast, olfactory recipient regions including piriform, <b>entorhinal,</b> and orbitofrontal <b>cortex</b> showed the opposite pattern, increasingly greater activation in successively later retrieval tests.

40|$|The neural {{networks}} that putatively modulate aspects of normal emotional behavior have {{been implicated in}} the pathophysiology of mood disorders by converging evidence from neuroimaging, neuropathological and lesion analysis studies. These networks involve the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and closely related areas in the medial and caudolateral orbital cortex (medial prefrontal network), amygdala, hippocampus, and ventromedial parts of the basal ganglia, where alterations in grey matter volume and neurophysiological activity are found in cases with recurrent depressive episodes. Such findings hold major implications for models of the neurocircuits that underlie depression. In particular evidence from lesion analysis studies suggests that the MPFC and related limbic and striato-pallido-thalamic structures organize emotional expression. The MPFC {{is part of a}} larger âdefault systemâ of cortical areas that include the dorsal PFC, mid- and posterior cingulate cortex, anterior temporal <b>cortex,</b> and <b>entorhinal</b> and parahippocampal <b>cortex,</b> which has been implicated in self-referential functions. Dysfunction within and between structures in this circuit may induce disturbances in emotional behavior and other cognitive aspects of depressive syndromes in humans. Further, because the MPFC and related limbic structures provide forebrain modulation over visceral control structures in the hypothalamus and brainstem, their dysfunction can account for the disturbances in autonomic regulation and neuroendocrine responses that are associated with mood disorders. This paper discusses these systems together with the neurochemical systems that impinge on them and form the basis for most pharmacological therapies...|$|R
40|$|The {{crucial role}} of the medial {{temporal}} lobe (MTL) in episodic memory is well established. Although {{there is little doubt}} that its anatomical subregionsâthe hippocampus, peri-, <b>entorhinal</b> and parahippocampal <b>cortex</b> (PHC) âcontribute differentially to mnemonic processes, their specific functions in episodic memory are under debate. Data from animal, human lesion, and neuroimaging studies suggest somewhat contradictory perspectives on this functional specialization: a general participation in declarative memory, an exclusive involvement in associative mnemonic processes, and a specific contribution to spatial memory are reported for the hippocampus, adjacent cortices, and the PHC. A functional lateralization in humans dependent on the verbalizability of the material is also discussed herein. To further elucidate the differential contributions of the various MTL subregions to encoding, we employed an object-location association memory paradigm. The memory for each of the studied associations was tested twice: by the object, and by the location serving as retrieval cue. The memory accuracy in response to both cue types was also assessed parametrically. Brain activity during encoding which leads to different degrees of subsequent memory accuracy under the two retrieval conditions was compared. We found the bilateral posterior PHC to participate in encoding of both the object associated with a location and the location associated with an object. In contrast, activity in an area in the left anterior PHC and the right anterior MTL was only correlated with the memory for the location associated with an object...|$|R
