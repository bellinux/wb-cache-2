However unlike directives, {{framework decision}}s were not capable of direct effect, they were only subject to the optional jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and enforcement proceedings could not be taken by the European Commission for any <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>transpose</b> a framework decision into domestic law.|$|E

The European normative act that establishes the general cooperation norms in this matter is the Council’sDecision Frame 2005 / 214 /JAI on February 24, 2005 on the application of the principle of mutual recognition of financial penalties. This European normative act has been transposed in the internallegislation through Law no. 302 / 2004, according to the international judicial cooperation in criminal matters, with the subsequent amendments and completions, the latter being represented by Lawno. 222 / 2008. The amendments and completions instituted by the abovementioned normative act establish the procedure of transmitting the decision, the procedures for recognition and execution ofsuch a decision by the competent Romanian judicial authorities, the grounds of non recognition and non execution, the definition of used terms, as well as other aspects referring to the recognition andexecution of such decisions. Commenting refers to a number of provisions in the law under both European and domestic in the special law, comments aimed in particular the replacement of terms ofrecognition or non-performance reasons, the procedure of identification of persons convicted when they are evade the enforcement of financial obligations and <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>transpose</b> into national law of subsequent changes to European law...|$|E
40|$|The Time-Limit Prescription: A Difficult Dialogue {{between the}} Court of Justice of the European Union and the National Judge This article aims to {{underline}} the uncertainties and ambiguities surrounding {{the application of}} European Court’s case law principles into the national legal system. More specifically, {{the issue of the}} time-limits for bringing an action based on EC/ EU law in a domestic court is an emblematic example of how different could be the judicial protection of individual rights in the Member States, and how difficult could be “to transfer” the addresses marked by the Court of Justice in national codes. 71 Cass., sez. lavoro, sentenza dell’ 8 febbraio 2012, n. 1850. Il difficile dialogo in tema di decorrenza del termine di prescrizione 83 In its first part the article points out the efforts of the ECJ in balancing the rules of national procedural laws (the so called principle of procedural autonomy of Member States) with the effectiveness of European Union law. Therefore it illustrates the origin and evolution of case law on time limit prescription starting from the Emmott case up to Danske Slagterier. In the second part the article deals with the national limitation periods applicable to claims based on Directives not fully implemented before the Italian courts: the case that led to a paradigm of uncertainty of interpretations (on the issue of the limitation period) of EU law is related to the Italian medical trainees. The main problem has been the exact classification of the legal basis of the State’s responsibility for late or non-faithful transposition of the Directive referred to medical trainees: at the beginning the Italian Supreme Court 7630 / 2003 addressed the responsibility under Article 2043 of the Italian civil code (with the consequent application of the limitation period of five years for claims). Then starting from the judgment of Cassazione 9147 / 2009, up to the most recent decisions Cassazione 17350 / 2011, and Cassazione 10813 / 2011 the State’s responsibility (for late or non-faithful transposition of the Directive) has been described as contractual liability (with the consequent application for claims of the limitation period of ten years). Finally it is remarked that all the efforts of the Italian courts to achieve a reasonable balance with the rulings of ECJ have been wiped out by law no. 183 / 2011 (the so-called Law of Stability, of November 12, 2011) : under Article 43 it is stated that “the prescription of the right to compensation for damage caused by <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>transpose</b> into the State the Directives or other binding European measures follows the rules laid down in Article 2947 of the Civil Code” (it means the application for claims of a limitation period of five years). All the reasons that make the provision atypical are illustrated in this articl...|$|E
