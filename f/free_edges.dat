[...] Firstly, the hypothesis assumes that two peptide groups can be crosslinked by a cyclol reaction (Figure 1); these crosslinks are covalent analogs of non-covalent hydrogen bonds between peptide groups. [...] These reactions have been observed in the ergopeptides and other compounds. [...] Secondly, it assumes that, under some conditions, amino acids will naturally make the maximum possible number of cyclol crosslinks, resulting in cyclol molecules (Figure 2) and cyclol fabrics (Figure 3). [...] These cyclol molecules and fabrics have never been observed. [...] Finally, the hypothesis assumes that globular proteins have a tertiary structure corresponding to Platonic solids and semiregular polyhedra formed of cyclol fabrics with no <b>free</b> <b>edges.</b> [...] Such [...] "closed cyclol" [...] molecules have not been observed either.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} labiaplasty {{technique was}} simple resection of tissues at the free {{edge of the}} labia minora. One resection-technique variation features a clamp placed across the area of labial tissue to be resected, {{in order to establish}} hemostatis (stopped blood-flow), and the surgeon resects the tissues, and then sutures the cut labium minus or labia minora. This procedure is used by most surgeons because it is easiest to perform. The technical disadvantages of the labial-edge resection technique are the loss of the natural rugosity (wrinkles) of the labia minora <b>free</b> <b>edges,</b> thus, aesthetically, it produces an unnatural appearance to the vulva, and also presents a greater risk of damaging the pertinent nerve endings. Moreover, there also exists the possibility of everting (turning outwards) the inner lining of the labia, which then makes visible the normally hidden internal, pink labial tissues. The advantages of edge-resection include removal of the hyper-pigmented (darkened) irregular labial edges with a linear scar. Another disadvantage of the trim or [...] "amputation" [...] method, is that it is unable to excise redundant tissues of the clitoral hood, when present. Complete amputation of the labia minora is more common with this technique, which often requires additional surgery to correct. In addition, the trim method does not address the clitoral hood. Clitoral hood deformities are common with this approach, again requiring additional corrective surgery. Some women complain of a [...] "small penis" [...] when the trim procedure is performed, owing to the un-addressed clitoral hood tissue and completely removed (amputated) labia minor. Most plastic surgeons do not perform this procedure, and instead favor the extended wedge approach, which is technically more demanding, but produces a more natural result and is able to create a natural and proportioned appearance to the vulva. Reconstructive procedures are often required after the trim (amputation) labiaplasty.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{studies the}} {{interaction}} of Lamb waves with the <b>free</b> <b>edge</b> of a plate. The reflection coefficients of a Lamb mode at a plate <b>free</b> <b>edge</b> are calculated using a semi-analytical method, {{as a function of}} frequency and angle of incidence. The conversion between forward and backward Lamb modes is thoroughly investigated. It is shown that, at the zero-group velocity (ZGV) frequency, the forward $S_ 1 $ Lamb mode fully converts into the backward $S_{ 2 b}$ Lamb mode at normal incidence. Besides, this conversion is very efficient over most of the angular spectrum and remains dominant at frequencies just above the ZGV-point. This effect is observed experimentally on a Duralumin plate. Firstly, the $S_ 1 $ Lamb mode is selectively generated using a transducer array, secondly the $S_{ 2 b}$ mode is excited using a single circular transducer. The normal displacement field is probed with an interferometer. The <b>free</b> <b>edge</b> is shown to retro-focus the incident wave at different depths depending on the wave number mismatch between the forward and backward propagating modes.

50|$|For the shear {{strengthening}} of a beam, the FRP is applied {{on the web}} (sides) of a member with fibres oriented transverse to the beam's longitudinal axis. Resisting of shear forces is achieved {{in a similar manner}} as internal steel stirrups, by bridging shear cracks that form under applied loading. FRP can be applied in several configurations, depending on the exposed faces of the member and the degree of strengthening desired, this includes: side bonding, U-wraps (U-jackets), and closed wraps (complete wraps). Side bonding involves applying FRP to the sides of the beam only. It provides the least amount of shear strengthening due to failures caused by de-bonding from the concrete surface at the FRP <b>free</b> <b>edges.</b> For U-wraps, the FRP is applied continuously in a 'U' shape around the sides and bottom (tension) face of the beam. If all faces of a beam are accessible, the use of closed wraps is desirable as they provide the most strength enhancement. Closed wrapping involves applying FRP around the entire perimeter of the member, such that there are no free ends and the typical failure mode is rupture of the fibres. For all wrap configurations, the FRP can be applied {{along the length of the}} member as a continuous sheet or as discrete strips, having a predefined minimum width and spacing.|$|E
