40|$|A heated Torch Integrated Sample Introduction System (hTISIS) {{has been}} applied to the {{analysis}} of petroleum products and biofuels through Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Three elements have been determined because of their importance in the petroleum industry: V, Ni and Mn. Sample injection has been accomplished by means of the introduction of a low sample volume (2. 5 μl) into an air carrier stream. A peak has been thus obtained. Two sets of samples have been selected: five solvents (xylene, kerosene, nonane, undecane and hexadecane) and five real samples (biodiesel, diesel, kerosene, superethanol and gasoline). The chamber temperature has been varied when introducing either solvents or real samples. In both cases it has been found that sensitivity peaked at 110 °C heating temperature. However, non-spectral interferences caused by differences in the matrix composition became less severe as this variable was increased and they were virtually eliminated at temperatures of 150 °C (alkanes) and 200 °C (real samples). When comparing with a default spray chamber (i. e., conical chamber with an <b>impact</b> <b>bead)</b> 3 to 6 times lower LODs were obtained. At 150 °C, this parameter has taken values of approximately 80 ng l− 1 for V and Ni to 140 ng l− 1 for Mn. At 200 °C heating temperature it has been possible to carry out accurate ICP-MS determinations by applying external calibration. Additional advantages of the present approach were that no oxygen was required to avoid soot deposition at the sampler cone and that nickel, instead of platinum cones, was used...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} is to present the in vitro characterization and detailed drug-loading procedure for DC Bead, a microsphere product that can be loaded with chemotherapeutic agents for embolization. MATERIALS AND METHODS DC Bead is an embolic microsphere product {{that is capable of}} being loaded with anthracycline drugs such as doxorubicin just before administration in a transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) procedure. Beads can be loaded from solutions prepared from doxorubicin powder or the doxorubicin HCl formulation. In this evaluation, bead sizes were measured by optical microscopy with video imaging. Gravimetric analysis demonstrated the effect of drug loading on bead water content, and its consequent impact on bead compressibility was determined. The subsequent deliverability of the beads was assessed by mixing the beads with contrast medium and saline solution and passing the beads through an appropriately sized microcatheter. A T-cell apparatus was used to monitor the in vitro elution of the drug from the beads over a period of 24 hours in various elution media. RESULTS DC Bead spheres could be easily loaded with doxorubicin to a recommended level of 25 mg/mL of hydrated beads by immersion of the beads in the drug solution for 10 – 120 minutes depending on microsphere size. Other commercial embolic microspheres were shown not to load doxorubicin to the same extent or release it in the same fashion and were considered unsuitable for local drug delivery. Maximum theoretic capacity for DC Bead was approximately 45 mg/mL. Increase in doxorubicin loading resulted in a concomitant decrease in water content and consequential increase in bead resistance to compression force. Drug loading also resulted in a decrease in the average size of the beads, which was dependent on bead size and drug dose. This did not <b>impact</b> <b>bead</b> delivery at any drug loading level to a maximum of 37. 5 mg/mL. Beads 100 – 700 μm in size could be delivered through 2. 7 -F microcatheters, whereas the 700 – 900 -μm range required 3 -F catheters. Modeling of the kinetics of drug elution from the beads in vitro at a loading dose of 25 mg/mL yielded calculated half-lives of 150 hours for the 100 – 300 -μm range to a maximum of 1, 730 hours for the 700 – 900 -μm size range, which was dependent on the ionic strength of the elution medium. For comparison, there was a rapid loss of drug from an unstable Lipiodol emulsion with a half-life of approximately 1 hour. CONCLUSIONS DC Bead can be loaded with doxorubicin to provide an accurate dosage of drug per unit volume of beads. Drug elution is dependent on ion exchange with the surrounding environment and is controlled and sustained, unlike the rapid separation of the drug from Lipiodol. Drug loading has no impact on the handling and deliverability of the beads, making them suitable for superselective TACE. ...|$|E

40|$|Spherules {{of glass}} varying {{in size from}} a few micrometres to a few millimetres are common in the lunar regolith. While some of these glass beads are {{products}} of pyroclastic fire fountains others originate as impact melt ejected from the target that breaks into small droplets and solidifies as spherical particles while raining back to the lunar surface. These glasses preserve information about the chemical composition of the target and often contain sufficient amount of radioactive nuclides such as 40 K to enable Ar- 40 -Ar- 39 dating of individual beads.

We then particularise this theoretical framework to the case of forcing slightly below the Faraday instability threshold. Among others, this theory yields a rationale for the dependence of the wave amplitude to the phase of impact, as well as the characteristic timescale and length scale of viscous damping.

Olive mill wastewater (OMW) has environmental impacts {{due to its}} high organic load and contents in phenols, lipids and organic acids. The project Oleico +, supported by the European Program LIFE, brought together 4 Institutions from 4 European Member States to seek and select a set of environmental friendly technologies for the remediation or valorization of olive mill wastes, and to raise the awareness of olive oil stakeholders for an environmental sustainable olive mill waste management. The OLEICO + project selected eight technologies to manage olive mill wastes that may be applied to different olive mill systems and amounts of waste generated.

40|$|International audienceThe seismic signals {{generated}} by rockfalls can {{provide information on}} their dynamics and location. However, the lack of field observations {{makes it difficult to}} establish clear relationships between the characteristics of the signal and the source. In this study, scaling laws are derived from analytical impact models to relate the mass and the speed of an individual impactor to the radiated elastic energy and the frequency content of the emitted seismic signal. It appears that the radiated elastic energy and frequencies decrease when the impact is viscoelastic or elasto-plastic compared to the case of an elastic impact. The scaling laws are validated with laboratory experiments of <b>impacts</b> of <b>beads</b> and gravels on smooth thin plates and rough thick blocks. Regardless of the involved materials, the masses and speeds of the impactors are retrieved from seismic measurements within afactor of 3. A quantitative energy budget of the impacts is established. On smooth thin plates, the lost energy is either radiated in elastic waves or dissipated in viscoelasticity when the impactor is large or small with respect to the plate thickness, respectively. In contrast, on rough thick blocks, theelastic energy radiation represents less than 5 % of the lost energy. Most of the energy is lost in plastic deformation or rotation modes of the bead owingto surface roughness. Finally, we estimate the elastic energy radiated during field scale rockfalls experiments. This energy is shown to be proportional to the boulder mass, in agreement with the theoretical scaling laws...|$|R

40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) at the Savannah River Site vitrifies High Level Waste for {{repository}} internment. The process {{consists of}} three major steps: waste pretreatment, vitrification, and canister decontamination/sealing. The HLW consists of insoluble metal hydroxides (primarily iron, aluminum, magnesium, manganese, and uranium) and soluble sodium salts (carbonate, hydroxide, nitrite, nitrate, sulfate). The pretreatment process acidifies the sludge with nitric and formic acids, adds the glass formers as glass frit, then concentrates the resulting slurry to approximately 50 weight percent (wt%) total solids. This slurry is fed to the joule-heated melter where the remaining water is evaporated followed by calcination of the solids and conversion to glass. The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) is currently assisting DWPF efforts to increase throughput of the melter. As part of this effort, SRNL has investigated methods to increase the solids content of the melter feed to reduce the heat load required to complete the evaporation of water and allow more of the energy available to calcine and vitrify the waste. The process equipment in the facility is fixed and cannot process materials with high yield stresses, therefore increasing the solids content will require that the yield stress of the melter feed slurries be reduced. Changing the glass former added during pretreatment from an irregularly shaped glass frit to nearly spherical beads was evaluated. The evaluation required a systems approach which included evaluations {{of the effectiveness of}} beads in reducing the melter feed yield stress as well as evaluations of the processing impacts of changing the frit morphology. Processing <b>impacts</b> of <b>beads</b> include changing the settling rate of the glass former (which effects mixing and sampling of the melter feed slurry and the frit addition equipment) as well as impacts on the melt behavior due to decreased surface area of the beads versus frit.

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{engineering}} friendly one-step {{process has been}} used to prepare zirconium titanium mixed oxide beads with porosity on multiple length scales. In this facile synthesis, the bead diameter and the macroporosity can be conveniently controlled through minor alterations in the synthesis conditions. The precursor solution consisted of poly(acrylonitrile) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to which was added block copolymer Pluronic F 127 and metal alkoxides. The millimeter-sized spheres were fabricated with differing macropore dimensions and morphology through dropwise addition of the precursor solution into a gelation bath consisting of water (H 2 O beads) or liquid nitrogen (LN 2 beads). The inorganic beads obtained after calcination (550 °C in air) had surface areas of 140 and 128 m 2 g− 1, respectively, and had varied pore architectures. The H 2 O-derived beads had much larger macropores (5. 7 μm) and smaller mesopores (6. 3 nm) compared with the LN 2 -derived beads (0. 8 μm and 24 nm, respectively). Pluronic F 127 was an important addition to the precursor solution, as it resulted in increased surface area, pore volume, and compressive yield point. From nonambient XRD analysis, it was concluded that the zirconium and titanium were homogeneously mixed within the oxide. The beads were analyzed for surface accessibility and adsorption rate by monitoring the uptake of uranyl species from solution.

Macro-scale effects of the laser factors and matrix properties were evaluated with ICP-MS detection.

By operating in a tapping mode, the AFM is capable of sub-nanometer resolution in three dimensions and can distinguish between substances of different compositions by employing phase-contrast imaging. Phase imaging is an extension of tapping-mode AFM that provides nanometer-scale information about surface composition not revealed in the topography. Phase imaging maps the phase of the cantilever oscillation during the tapping mode scan, hence detecting variations in composition, adhesion, friction, and viscoelasticity. Because phase imaging highlights edges and is not affected by large-scale height differences, it provides for clearer observation of fine features, such as grain edges, which can be obscured by rough topography. To prepare for the Mars 01 mission, we are testing the AFM on a lunar soil and terrestrial basaltic glasses to determine the AFMOs ability to define particle shapes and sizes and grain-surface textures. The test materials include the Apollo 17 soil 79221, which is a mixture of agglutinates, <b>impact</b> and volcanic <b>beads,</b> and mare and highland rock and mineral fragments. The majority of the lunar soil particles are less than 100 microns in size, comparable to the sizes estimated for Martian dust. The terrestrial samples are millimeter size basaltic glasses collected on Black Pointe at Mono Lake, just north of the Long Valley caldera in California. The basaltic glass formed by a phreatomagmatic eruption 13, 000 years ago beneath a glacier that covered the Mono Lake region. Because basaltic glass formed by reworking of pyroclastic deposits may represent a likely source for Martian dunes, these basaltic glass samples represent plausible analogs to the types of particles that may be studied in sand dunes by the 01 lander and rover. We have used the AFM to examine several different soil particles at various resolutions.
