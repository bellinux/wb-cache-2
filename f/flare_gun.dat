5|$|Prior {{to a new}} hotel {{opening on}} Amity Island, an {{enormous}} great white shark ambushes and kills two divers who are photographing {{the wreck of the}} Orca. A couple of days later, their camera is recovered, and the shark goes after a female water skier and speedboat driver, killing the skier, while the driver fends off the shark using a gas tank and <b>flare</b> <b>gun,</b> causing the boat to explode, which kills her and severely burns the shark's face.|$|E
5|$|Mulder and Ludwig {{venture into}} the {{volcanic}} caves to find Trepkos. When they find Firewalker, Trepkos shoots Ludwig {{in the back with}} a <b>flare</b> <b>gun,</b> killing him. He then burns Ludwig's body, as he was infected with the spore as well. Trepkos tells Mulder that after Firewalker returned from its first descent, Erickson pulverized a rock in one of its samples, resulting in his death and the infection of all the scientists immediately surrounding him. Trepkos says that the spore is parasitic in nature, making its hosts pass itself on to others. Meanwhile, in the lab, an infected O'Neil handcuffs herself to Scully to expose her to the spore, forcing Scully to use a hammer to split the chains but to no avail, so she instead protects herself by throwing O'Neil into a sealed chamber and closing the door. A protrusion then bursts out of O'Neil's throat, killing her without spreading the spore to Scully.|$|E
5|$|Following David and Shaw's exodus for the Engineer home world, {{they arrive}} at a temple {{surrounded}} by scores of Engineers. David carpet bombs them with the mutagen, resulting in the extinction of all non-floral life on the planet, as well as mutations in the flora that can infect and impregnate organisms with Neomorphs. The Engineer ship crashes afterwards and Shaw dies from unknown means, though David preserves and utilizes her body in his eugenics experiments. Ten years later, a team from the colony ship Covenant is attacked by two Neomorphs that burst from two of their bodies. David intervenes by frightening them away with a <b>flare</b> <b>gun.</b> He urges the survivors to follow him to the temple, where he has established his laboratory. Sporting overgrown hair, David introduces himself and offers them shelter, while learning about the 2,000 colonists and hundreds of embryos in stasis aboard Covenant. He takes {{a special interest in}} the successor model from his own synthetic line, Walter, and tells him that Shaw died when the Engineer ship crashed. David claims to have loved Shaw and compares it to Walter's attachment to the terraforming expert Daniels, which Walter dismisses as being impossible. David attempts to bond with Walter by teaching him to play the flute. They recognize that while Walter is more advanced, he has been inhibited from creating, due to disturbances caused by David models with that feature.|$|E

25|$|During {{the fight}} the Bertram was {{severely}} damaged {{but did not}} sink. The Israelis were only able to sink it by firing a 25mm <b>Flare</b> <b>gun,</b> which ignited the Bertram, causing it to explode.|$|E
25|$|U-181 {{surfaced}} and intercepted {{the four}} remaining lifeboats, interrogating them as to cargo and destination. Although the crew {{refused to answer}} any questions, the U-boat’s skipper gave the Fort Lee crew a <b>flare</b> <b>gun</b> and flares, some blankets, food, and medicine, and allowed the boats to go on their way.|$|E
25|$|Following the battle, three Israeli crewmen {{were awarded}} the Medal of Distinguished Service: Zvi Shahak, who {{commanded}} the operation; 2nd Lt. Ami Segev, an officer on Shahak's Dabur who kept fighting even after being severely wounded; and Staff-Sergeant Shalom Nachmani, Shahak's Dabur chief mechanic. Able to patch the boat's damaged engines and restart them, Nachmani {{was in fact}} the one responsible for the boat's recovery after it ran aground. A fourth member of the crew, 2nd Lt. Nimrod Erez, who had fired the <b>flare</b> <b>gun</b> at the Bertram, was awarded the Chief Of Staff Citation.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s Röhm GmbH of Sontheim/Brenz, which was {{traditionally}} {{focused on the}} production of chucking tools, diversified its product line and began to produce gas alarm <b>guns,</b> <b>flare</b> <b>guns</b> and handguns. Röhm's product line of firearms was primarily established under the brand name RG.|$|R

25|$|Jones' age notwithstanding, he was {{recalled}} in August 1939 as Chief Signals Officer, Training Command Headquarters. By July, acting Wing Commander Jones was OC No. 7 Bombing and Gunnery School, RAF Porthcawl. It {{was here that}} one of his most famed actions occurred when, whilst flying an unarmed Hawker Henley near Swansea, he attacked a Junkers Ju 88 bomber with a Very pistol, a type of <b>flare</b> <b>gun.</b> His actions were enough to fight off the Junkers which returned to its base. On 1 September, he was promoted to the temporary rank of wing commander, with the service number 04084. After a spell in charge of 57 OTU at Hawarden in January 1941, Jones was tasked with forming No 59 OTU at Turnhouse, near Edinburgh, and then sent to command No 53 OTU Heston, Middlesex. He reportedly flew several unofficial operations in a Spitfire, taking part in several fighter sweeps over Europe.|$|E
25|$|The {{students}} {{pass the}} hours by talking, arguing, and, at one point, smoking marijuana that Bender retrieves from his locker. Gradually, they {{open up to}} each other and reveal their deepest personal secrets: Allison is a compulsive liar; Andrew cannot easily think for himself; Bender comes from an abusive household; Brian was planning suicide with a <b>flare</b> <b>gun</b> due to the inability to cope with a bad grade; and Claire is a virgin who feels constant pressure from her friends to be a certain way. They also discover that they all have strained relationships with their parents, which are a key cause for their personal issues as well: Allison's parents ignore her due to their own problems; Andrew's father constantly criticizes his efforts at wrestling and pushes him as hard as possible; Bender's father verbally and physically abuses him; Brian's overbearing parents put immense pressure on him to earn high grades; and Claire's parents use her to get back at each other during frequent arguments. The students realize that, even with their differences, they face similar pressures and complications in their lives.|$|E
25|$|Despite Osborne's {{suspicious}} and apprehensive feelings towards him, {{they form a}} relationship. McSwain is caught accepting payoffs in an Internal Affairs sting, and Osborne has the burden of prosecuting him. With the assistance of fellow officers within the police force, the evidence is destroyed and suppressed. McSwain is cleared of the charges, at which point Anne, now clued in, is faced with the conflict of her personal feelings for Remy and her duty to uphold the law. It is later revealed that Jack Kellom (Ned Beatty), Remy's boss and the two detectives De Soto (John Goodman) and Dodge (Ebbe Roe Smith) are behind the murder, and a stash of heroin is hidden at a boat yard. Kellom goes to the boat and is confronted by De Soto and Dodge. Kellom suggests {{getting rid of the}} drugs, but De Soto shoots Kellom. Remy and Anne arrive and are confronted by De Soto and Dodge, and a shootout starts, resulting in De Soto being shot by a fatally wounded Kellom, and Dodge being shot with a <b>flare</b> <b>gun</b> by Remy, which starts a fire, and Remy and Anne make a run for it {{in the nick of time}} just before the boat explodes.|$|E

500|$|The {{developers}} {{intended to}} require the players to employ more tactical approaches to maps, in their introduction of such units as the <b>Flare</b> <b>Gun,</b> a vehicle that could reveal parts of the map hidden by fog of war, and the commanding officers, who have had their [...] "CO Powers" [...] reduced in importance from the previous titles. However, the developers added that {{one does not have}} to be a [...] "master strategist" [...] to play the game, commenting that the <b>Flare</b> <b>Gun</b> could be used by a casual gamer to quickly move across a map covered in fog of war, while a more advanced player may use it for more strategic means. This unit was added as a means to speed up stages with fog of war. Other new units include the Bike, which was a means of achieving a faster tempo to the game. When asked why the Duster, a modification of a crop duster, was added in favor of the stealth jet from Advance Wars: Dual Strike, the developers commented that the Duster was an inexpensive aerial unit that was not only easy-to-use, but could attack ground units as well. The unit was also added to be a throwback to an older era, as well as demonstrating how people in this world use anything they can as a means of survival.|$|E
500|$|Cliff {{flies to}} and boards the airship, {{but during the}} ensuing showdown, Jenny accidentally sets the bridge on fire using a <b>flare</b> <b>gun.</b> Sinclair holds Jenny hostage, forcing Cliff {{to give him the}} rocket, but not before he {{secretly}} removes the chewing gum patch, allowing fuel to leak near the jet pack's exhaust. Sinclair dons the rocket pack and flies off, but the leaked fuel causes the rocket pack to catch on fire, causing Sinclair to plummet to his death near the [...] "HOLLYWOODLAND" [...] sign; the resulting explosion destroys the LAND part of the sign. Lothar is engulfed in flames as the airship explodes, but Cliff and Jenny are rescued at the last moment by Hughes and Peevy flying an autogyro.|$|E
500|$|While snorkelling, Bond meets Domino. Later, at a casino, he {{encounters}} Domino and Largo, who {{has taken}} Domino as his mistress. Bond enters a game against Largo and wins, and subsequently takes Domino to a dance. Bond and Largo recognise each other as adversaries and begin a tense cat-and-mouse game of attempting to gain advantage over each other while still pretending ignorance of their adversary's true nature. Bond meets Felix Leiter and Q, and is issued various gadgets, including an underwater infrared camera, a distress beacon, underwater breathing apparatus, a <b>flare</b> <b>gun,</b> and a Geiger counter. Diving under Largo's ship, the Disco Volante, Bond fails to find the atomic bomb, but detects an underwater hatch; Bond narrowly escapes Largo's henchmen. The next day, Bond visits Largo at his estate, Palmyra.|$|E
50|$|In World War II, Germany {{manufactured}} grenades {{designed to}} be fired from adapted <b>flare</b> <b>guns</b> known as the Kampfpistole, or Sturmpistole in its final form. The weapon was designed to function as an anti-tank weapon but failed to perform to expectations due to the minuscule amount of TNT carried in the hollow charge projectiles.|$|R

500|$|In 1970, Jagger bought [...] "Stargroves", a {{manor house}} and estate in Hampshire. The Rolling Stones {{and several other}} bands {{recorded}} there using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Led Zeppelin, used the mobile studio to record material for the albums Physical Graffiti and Houses of the Holy. Dire Straits, Lou Reed, Bob Marley, Horslips, Fleetwood Mac, Bad Company, Status Quo, Iron Maiden and Wishbone Ash all recorded within the mobile studio. The Who recorded [...] "Won't Get Fooled Again" [...] in Stargroves itself. The Rolling Stones mobile studio was also used to record the Deep Purple song, [...] "Smoke on the Water". The lyrics to the song, which they had not intended to release, mention the mobile studio and were intended as a joke about it almost being {{burned to the ground}} by a nearby fire. In order to rescue the mobile from the first started by a <b>flare</b> <b>gun,</b> the Stones crew had to smash a window and release the parking brake to roll it out of the way. Deep Purple referred to it as the [...] "Rolling truck Stones thing" [...] in the song, stating previously in the song [...] "We all came out to Montreux ... to make records with a mobile." [...] The mobile is currently owned by the National Music Centre in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.|$|E
500|$|After {{finishing}} the story, Peter carelessly aims a <b>flare</b> <b>gun</b> through an air vent, causing the sprinklers to come on. Meanwhile, Meg {{is trying to}} persuade the burglars to attack her {{but they are not}} interested. The rest of the family, still trapped in the panic room, are preparing to potentially drown from the sprinklers filling the room up with water. Peter tells the story of his ancestor, Willie [...] "Black-Eye" [...] Griffin, who was a silent film star in the 1920s, but whose career later faltered due to his vo(much like Bobcat Goldthwait's) not being cut out for talking pictures. Peter then tells his family about his great uncle, Peter Hitler, who was able to provide Adolf Hitler with success at his Munich speech, although annoying Adolf greatly. As the water from the sprinklers almost reaches its peak, Peter admits to the family that he did not care for The Godfather and a heated debate ensues, ending with Peter declaring his love for The Money Pit. At the last minute Joe rescues them, draining the water out of the room, thus saving their lives. Joe informs the family he has arrested the burglars, but they are pressing harassment charges against Meg. Joe warns that they will need a lawyer to combat the charges, but the family ignores him, and Joe finally gives up and takes Meg away while the family ignores her cries for help.|$|E
500|$|The Marsh {{family is}} {{spending}} Stan's ninth birthday {{at a public}} aquarium in Denver. As the Marshes enjoy interacting with the trained bottlenose dolphins, Japanese armed with spears suddenly storm the dolphinarium and kill all the dolphins. The Japanese perform similar attacks at several other aquariums, and at an NFL game, where they kill members of the Miami Dolphins football team. Stan asks his friends Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny to help him take on the cause of saving the dolphins and whales from the Japanese. Kyle declines, feeling they can't change Japan's views on the issue. Cartman and Kenny are {{much more interested in}} playing the video game Rock Band, professing they [...] "don't give two shits about stupid-ass whales". Eventually, Butters (who is also too busy) informs Stan about the television show Whale Wars, stating that they can take volunteers to help them. Seeing this as his chance, Stan takes Butters' advice and joins host Paul Watson and his crew aboard the Sea Shepherd, but is underwhelmed by their method of throwing [...] "stinky butter" [...] at Japanese whalers in an effort to deter them. After the Japanese whalers kill Watson with a harpoon, Stan destroys their ship by igniting their fuel barrels with a <b>flare</b> <b>gun.</b> Stan becomes the new captain and leads a more successful campaign in impeding the Japanese whaling effort by employing more aggressive methods. The crew ends up getting interviewed by Larry King, who describes Paul Watson as an [...] "incompetent media whore" [...] and questions Stan on his intentions of increasing ratings with violence. Stan dismisses the charge and contends he is only interested in saving the whales, not ratings.|$|E
50|$|While not {{intended}} as weapons, <b>flare</b> <b>guns</b> can {{and have been}} weaponized in some situations. In 1942, at Pembrey Airfield in Wales, a German pilot mistakenly landed at the field. The duty pilot, Sgt. Jeffreys, {{did not have a}} conventional weapon; he grabbed a Very pistol and used that to capture the German pilot, Oberleutnant Armin Faber.|$|R
50|$|From 1941 to 1944, {{the company}} made all the scope mounts for the Zf-41 sniper scope. In 1944-45 it was 1 of 2 only {{manufacturers}} to make mounts for the ZF4 sniper scope. From 1936-1940, BLM supplied many parts for field armourers using the 'duv' identification code. On a small scale, {{the company made}} M1928 <b>flare</b> <b>guns</b> and MG34 bolt parts and barrels.|$|R
50|$|<b>Flare</b> <b>guns</b> {{may be used}} {{whenever}} {{someone needs}} to send a distress signal. The flares must be shot directly above, making the signal visible {{for a longer period}} of time and revealing the position of whoever is in need of assistance. There are four distinct flare calibers; 12ga, 25mm, 26.5mm, and 37mm. The first three being the most popular for boaters.|$|R
500|$|The Germans {{knew the}} {{invasion}} was imminent {{if not the}} exact location; Major Schmidt, {{in command of the}} bridges, had been told that they were {{one of the most critical}} points in Normandy. The defenders however were not on full alert and only two sentries were on duty when the gliders landed. The sound of a gunshot alerted the two sentries on the canal bridge. As Brotheridge's platoon attacked, one ran off shouting [...] "paratroops" [...] while the second fired a <b>flare</b> <b>gun</b> to alert nearby defenders. Brotheridge shot him while other members of his platoon cleared the trenches and pillbox with grenades. Alerted by the flare, the German machine gunners opened fire at the men on the bridge, wounding Brotheridge as he threw a grenade. The grenade silenced one of the machine gun positions and another was taken out by Bren gun fire. Number One Platoon crossed the bridge to take up a defensive position on the west bank. The Royal Engineers from number one glider searched for explosive charges and cut the fuse wires when they found any. Smith's platoon crossed the bridge next, exchanging fire with the German defenders, whereupon Smith was wounded by a grenade. Using grenades and sub-machine gun fire, the platoons cleared the trenches and bunkers. By 00:21 German resistance on the west bank of the canal bridge was over. Checking the area, the men of Brotheridge's platoon now realised that their leader was wounded. He failed to recover and soon died of his wounds, becoming the first Allied soldier killed by enemy action during the invasion. On the east bank, Wood's platoon cleared the trenches and bunkers with little opposition. Woods was hit in the leg by machine-gun fire as he ordered the platoon to storm the German defences. All three platoon commanders at the canal bridge were now either dead or wounded.|$|E
2500|$|Flare guns {{have also}} been {{converted}} to firearms. This may be accomplished by replacing the (often plastic) barrel of the <b>flare</b> <b>gun</b> with a metal pipe strong enough to chamber a shotgun shell, or by inserting a smaller-bore barrel into the existing barrel (such as with a caliber conversion sleeve) to chamber a firearm cartridge, such as a [...]22 Long Rifle.|$|E
2500|$|McVeigh's anti-government rhetoric {{became more}} radical. He began to sell Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) hats riddled with bullet holes and a <b>flare</b> <b>gun,</b> which, he said, could shoot down an [...] "ATF helicopter". He {{produced}} videos detailing the government's actions at Waco and handed out pamphlets {{with titles like}} [...] "U.S. Government Initiates Open Warfare Against American People" [...] and [...] "Waco Shootout Evokes Memory of Warsaw '43." [...] He began changing his answering machine greeting {{every couple of weeks}} to various quotes by Patrick Henry such as [...] "Give me liberty or give me death." [...] He began experimenting with pipe bombs and other small explosive devices. The government also imposed new firearms restrictions in 1994 that McVeigh believed threatened his livelihood.|$|E
50|$|A flare, also {{sometimes}} called a fusee, {{is a type}} of pyrotechnic that produces a brilliant light or intense heat without an explosion. Flares are used for signalling, illumination, or defensive countermeasures in civilian and military applications. Flares may be ground pyrotechnics, projectile pyrotechnics, or parachute-suspended to provide maximum illumination time over a large area. Projectile pyrotechnics may be dropped from aircraft, fired from rocket or artillery, or deployed by <b>flare</b> <b>guns</b> or handheld percussive tubes.|$|R
25|$|Occasionally, {{a fishing}} trawler will foul another's nets, or the {{sensitive}} border {{areas in the}} middle of the English Channel will be the focus of a dispute between trawlers. These disputes can escalate to attempted rammings, disruption of each other's fishing, shining searchlights into bridges and even firing <b>flare</b> <b>guns</b> at other trawlers. In these circumstances ships of the squadron are required to separate the trawlers and act as an informal arbitrator in the dispute to prevent further conflict or injury. Their rules of engagement reflect this role.|$|R
50|$|A small {{firearms}} carry permit (Kleiner Waffenschein) {{was introduced}} in 2002. It can be obtained without having to demonstrate expert knowledge, necessity or a mandatory insurance. The only requirements are that the applicant be of legal age, trustworthy and personally adequate. It entitles the licensee to publicly carry gas pistols (both of the blank and irritant kind) and <b>flare</b> <b>guns.</b> These types of firearms are freely available to adults; only the actual carrying on public property requires the permit. Similar to the full permit, carrying at public events is prohibited.|$|R
