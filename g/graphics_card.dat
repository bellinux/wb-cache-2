5|$|Lost Coast was {{released}} on October 27, 2005, as a free download from Valve's Steam content delivery service to anyone who purchased Half-Life 2. People who received Half-Life 2 as a gift from Valve's online store were not eligible to download the level. Valve announced on May 30, 2007 that Lost Coast, along with , would be made available for free to owners of ATI Radeon cards. It was later released without charge to Nvidia <b>graphics</b> <b>card</b> owners along with Half-Life 2: Deathmatch, Peggle Extreme, and the first eleven levels of Portal.|$|E
5|$|On March 9, 2015, the 13-inch {{model was}} updated with Intel Broadwell processors, Iris 6100 graphics, faster flash storage, {{increased}} battery life, and a Force Touch trackpad. On May 19, 2015, the 15-inch model was also updated with similarly fast flash storage, increased battery life, the Force Touch trackpad, and an AMD Radeon R9 discrete <b>graphics</b> <b>card</b> on the higher-end model. The higher-end 15-inch model also added support for dual-cable output to 5120×2880 displays. The 15-inch models were released {{with the same}} Intel Haswell processors and Iris Pro graphics as the 2014 models due to a delay in shipment of newer Broadwell quad-core processors.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{commented that}} the imaginative {{character}} designs and use of advanced graphics technology, such as hardware transform and lighting, and bump mapping, made the graphics of the game unrivaled in its time; ActionTrip was so impressed by the game's visuals that they thought their <b>graphics</b> <b>card</b> was supporting the complex hardware environmental bump mapping it was incapable of. The animation of Kabuto's antics such as elbow dropping onto tiny enemies, and tossing up and catching food with his mouth, in particular, won the praises of reviewers. Many critics, however, were disappointed that the computer versions of the game could not run smoothly at full details on the recommended system specifications.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, Nvidia {{launched}} the GTX Titan, a consumer <b>graphics</b> <b>card</b> {{that uses the}} same GPU die as the K20X GPUs in Titan. Titan underwent acceptance testing in early 2013 but only completed 92% of the tests, short of the required 95%. The problem was discovered to be excess gold in the female edge connectors of the motherboards' PCIe slots causing cracks in the motherboards' solder. The cost of repair was borne by Cray and between 12 and 16 cabinets were repaired each week. Throughout the repairs users were given access to the available CPUs. On March 11, they gained access to 8,972 GPUs. ORNL announced on April 8 that the repairs were complete and acceptance test completion was announced on June 11, 2013.|$|E
5|$|On October 20, 2009, Apple {{released}} a MacBook that {{introduced a new}} polycarbonate (plastic) unibody design, faster DDR3 memory, a multi-touch trackpad, an LED-backlit display, and a built-in seven-hour battery. The polycarbonate unibody MacBook, like its aluminum predecessor, lacks FireWire and, like the 13-inch MacBook Pro, has a combined audio in/out port. There is no infrared port and the Apple Remote is not included. On May 18, 2010, the MacBook was refreshed with a faster processor, a faster <b>graphics</b> <b>card,</b> improved battery life, {{and the ability to}} pass audio through the Mini DisplayPort connector. On July 20, 2011, the MacBook was discontinued for consumer purchases, but was still available to educational institutions until February 2012.|$|E
50|$|Gainward {{traditionally}} offers overclockable <b>graphic</b> <b>cards</b> that {{deviate from}} the reference specifications {{set forth by}} Nvidia, such as their Golden Sample range of <b>graphics</b> <b>cards.</b> These cards are overclocked past their stock speeds and tested before they are sold, to ensure quality for customers.

5|$|One {{reviewer}} {{criticized the}} decision to underclock the ATI Mobility Radeon X1600 <b>graphics</b> <b>card</b> by about 30percent its original speed. The notebook was also noted for running hot. Users complained that upgrading system memory was harder than in older Apple notebooks. Since the dimensions for the 15-inch MacBook Pro were tweaked slightly from the 15-inch PowerBook G4, older accessories such as notebook sleeves did not work with the new models. Some users noted a slight flickering when the screen was on lower brightness settings. Apple increased the battery capacity by 10 Wh, going from 50 in the PowerBook G4 to 60, but the more powerful Core Duo CPU required more power. Battery life therefore remained {{about the same as}} in previous models, at three-plus hours.|$|E
5|$|Rage Software, {{developers}} of Incoming, were {{known for their}} cutting-edge graphics and effects. Incoming was no exception. The game utilized the 3dfx technology, and was included in some retail versions of the Voodoo2 <b>graphics</b> <b>card.</b> Critics were praising the game's visuals on its 1998 PC release. In particular, the explosions, similar special effects and cut scenes using the main game engine were noted for their quality. The Dolby Surround-encoded sound was a further source of acclaim. The reception, however, was less positive when the game was ported to the Dreamcast. A release title for Sega's console, critics complained that the graphics were not top-of-the-range {{at the time of}} its late 1999 release, with the draw distance being cited as a specific hindrance on gameplay. An arcade version followed in 2003, running on the Vortek V3 Global VR arcade board, utilising the system's unique virtual reality hardware interface.|$|E
25|$|Supreme Commander {{is heavily}} reliant on raw {{processing}} {{power from the}} CPU and is less dependent on rendering power from the <b>graphics</b> <b>card.</b> When using a high-end <b>graphics</b> <b>card</b> the CPU {{is likely to become}} the main bottleneck.|$|E

25|$|Following the Open Graphics Project, {{an effort}} to design, implement, and {{manufacture}} a free and open 3D graphics chip set and reference <b>graphics</b> <b>card,</b> Timothy Miller suggested {{the creation of an}} organization to safeguard the interests of the Open Graphics Project community. Thus, Patrick McNamara founded the Open Hardware Foundation (OHF) in 2007.|$|E
50|$|The SLI {{bridge is}} used to reduce {{bandwidth}} constraints and send data between both <b>graphics</b> <b>cards</b> directly. It is possible to run SLI without using the bridge connector {{on a pair of}} low-end to mid-range <b>graphics</b> <b>cards</b> (e.g. 7100GS or 6600GT) with Nvidia's Forceware drivers 80.XX or later. Since these <b>graphics</b> <b>cards</b> do not use as much bandwidth, data can be relayed through just the chipsets on the motherboard. However, if there are two high-end <b>graphics</b> <b>cards</b> installed and the SLI bridge is omitted, the performance will suffer severely as the chipset does not have enough bandwidth.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{computing}} power of <b>graphics</b> <b>cards</b> has increased significantly. Indeed, {{the growth in the}} computing power of these <b>graphics</b> <b>cards</b> is now several orders of magnitude greater than the growth in the power of computer processor units. Thus these <b>graphics</b> <b>cards</b> are now beginning to be used by the scientific community as low cost, high performance computing platforms. Traditional genetic programming is a highly computer intensive algorithm but due to its parallel nature it can be distributed over multiple processors to increase the speed of the algorithm considerably. This is not applicable for single processor architectures but <b>graphics</b> <b>cards</b> provide a mechanism for developing a data parallel implementation of genetic programming. In this paper we will describe the technique of general purpose computing using <b>graphics</b> <b>cards</b> and how to extend this technique to genetic programming. We will demonstrate the improvement in the performance of genetic programming on single processor architectures which can be achieved by harnessing the computing power of these next generation <b>graphics</b> <b>cards...</b>|$|R
