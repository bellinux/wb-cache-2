500|$|I think that's bullshit. The word {{police can}} fuck off. I don't {{want to be}} policed! I'm not {{interested}} in political correctness. The word [...] "bitch" [...] means {{a lot of different}} things. Everything is about context. When I first moved to England and heard the word [...] "cunt", <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrified.</b> People were calling each other cunts! And then I realized that, in that culture, it was different—they slapped each other on the back and said, [...] "Who's the cunt, right, you're my best mate!" [...] The word [...] "fuck" [...] doesn't just mean sexual intercourse. I mean, [...] "You're a stupid fuck," [...] "Are you going to fuck with me?" [...] "Fuck off!"... Sex {{has nothing to do with}} any of those expressions, and the same goes for [...] "bitch". If I say to you, [...] "I'm a badass bitch," [...] I'm owning myself, I'm saying, [...] "I'm strong, I'm tough, and don't mess with me." [...] If I say, [...] "Why are you being such a bitch to me?," [...] well, that means something else.|$|E
500|$|Controversy {{was first}} {{reported}} by Australian music site Undercover.com.au on December 5, 2008, {{after the release}} of the album. Leonie Barsenbach, a housewife from Sydney, said, [...] "I was astonished and totally taken aback when I heard my 5 and 7 year old kids walking around the house singing 'F-U-C-K'... When I asked them what it was, they told me it was Britney Spears. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrified.</b> I got them the Circus album but there was no warning on it... It is extremely offensive. I feel deceived." [...] Rolling Stone writer Daniel Kreps defended Spears, arguing that parents should have been aware of the singer's musical themes. After the song was announced as the third single from the album, American radio stations were unsure about playing the track due to its double entendre in the chorus. Program directors of Z100 and KIIS-FM compared the issues to be faced by their radio stations to the release of the 2005 The Black Eyed Peas single, [...] "Don't Phunk with My Heart", saying that [...] "listeners thought it was the other word, and so we had to change it to 'mess'". Program director Patti Marshall of Q102 said [...] "It's ok to put in on an album, have fun with it, but we're publicly owned, you know? [...] It's not about us. It's about the mom in the minivan with her 8-year-old." [...] WFLZ's Tommy Chuck said his station produced their own edit of the song that replaced [...] "seek" [...] with [...] "see", with the station's disc jockeys referring to it as [...] "If U See Amy".|$|E
2500|$|John Petts died in 1991 {{at the age}} of 77. In a 1987 {{interview}} focusing {{upon his}} recollections of the bombing, Petts recollected: [...] "Naturally, as a father, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrified</b> by the deaths of those children." [...] Petts then elaborated that the inspiration for the stained-glass image was a verse from the Gospel of Matthew: [...] "Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me." [...] The Welsh Window bears the inscription, [...] "Given by The People of Wales".|$|E

6000|$|But {{the lady}} only shivered again. [...] "No! no! I have tried it--for Dora's sake--but I cannot do it! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>horrified</b> at his influence, but I cannot {{withstand}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, when I {{tell you}} that Lady Carnaby's Memories are simply not to be {{compared}} with your uncle's Recollections, you will understand my state of mind. And father appears in nearly every story in the book! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>horrified</b> at {{the things he did}} {{when he was a young}} man!" ...|$|R
2500|$|Waldheim {{called the}} {{allegations}} [...] "pure lies and malicious acts". In a telex to Bronfman, {{he said that}} his past had been “deliberately misinterpreted.” Nevertheless, he admitted that he had known about German reprisals against partisans: [...] "Yes, I knew. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrified.</b> But what could I do? I had either to continue to serve or be executed." [...] He said that he had never fired a shot or even seen a partisan. His former immediate superior at the time stated that Waldheim had [...] "remained confined to a desk".|$|E
2500|$|Greene {{is married}} to former ABC {{producer}} Tracy Day. Greene has been vegetarian since he {{was nine years old}} when he realized, [...] "...the connection between the meat and the animal from which it came direct; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrified</b> and declared I'd never eat meat again. And I never have." [...] He became vegan in 1997 after touring Farm Sanctuary in Watkins Glen, New York, where he learned, [...] "...about the dairy industry which was so disturbing that I could not continue to support it. Within days I gave up all dairy." ...|$|E

His former immediate superior at the time stated that Waldheim had [...] "remained confined to a desk". Former Austrian chancellor Bruno Kreisky, of Jewish origin, denounced the actions of the World Jewish Congress as an [...] "extraordinary infamy", adding that Austrians would not [...] "allow the Jews abroad to ... tell us who should be our President." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{so sorry}} to have kept you all this time!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Lady Anne has just told me the time and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>horrified.</b> <b>I</b> meant to walk here {{for an hour and}} we have been here for two. Stop that taxi for me, please. I cannot spare the time even to walk home." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Queen {{said she}} was [...] "utterly shocked" [...] and her [...] "thoughts were with all those affected". Her son and heir to the New Zealand throne, The Prince of Wales, also said to New Zealand's governor-general and prime minister: [...] "My wife and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>horrified</b> when we heard the news early this morning... The scale of the {{destruction}} all but defies belief when we can appreciate only too well how difficult {{it must have been}} struggling {{to come to terms with}} last year's horror ... Our deepest sympathy and constant thoughts are with you and all New Zealanders." ...|$|R
50|$|Tammy <b>I</b> <b>is</b> <b>horrified</b> at Ron's {{recordkeeping}} {{and demands}} access to {{every part of}} his life for the audit. Tammy I's strict maternal nature intimidates everyone into following her orders, which impresses April. Over {{the course of the next}} week, Tammy I moves back in with Ron and assumes complete control over him. Ron shaves off his moustache, becomes kind, and refuses to do anything without Tammy I's approval. Leslie needs Ron to be his usual gruff self for the battle royale and confronts Tammy I about the audit, which she admits is fake - she decided to take Ron back after learning about all the gold he had.|$|R
2500|$|From first grade, Bow {{preferred}} {{the company of}} boys, stating, [...] "I could lick any boy my size. My right arm was quite famous. My right arm was developed from pitching so much... Once I hopped a ride on behind a big fire engine. I {{got a lot of}} credit from the gang for that." [...] A close friend, a younger boy who lived in her building, burned to death in her presence after an accident. In 1919, Bow enrolled in Bay Ridge High School for Girls. [...] "I wore sweaters and old skirts...didn't want to be treated like a girl...there was one boy who had always been my pal... he kissed me... I wasn't sore. I didn't get indignant. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrified</b> and hurt." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We started class, {{and in the}} Groundlings curriculum, one of {{the first}} {{exercises}} you do is the cliched 'trust' game. I made everyone stand in a circle, with me in the center, and I said, being onstage, you have to trust your fellow actors, especially when you're an improviser. You're {{going to be there for}} each other, and they're going to be there for you. For example, I'm going to fall back, knowing that you'll catch me. Then I let myself fall backward, and sure enough, I was caught. Everyone gets out some nervous laughter, and then they all took turns doing it. By the time it got around to Mariska Hargitay, we'd already done it with ten or eleven students, and they had clearly gotten the point. Then it was Mariska's turn. 'Okay, Mariska, cross your arms in front of you and gently fall back,' I said. She fell back and nobody caught her. She fell flat on her ass. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrified.</b> This had never happened in one of my classes before." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1977 Fleetwood and Nicks began {{having an}} affair. It would {{continue}} sporadically {{for the next}} two years during the fallout from the end of Fleetwood's relationship with Boyd, until the pair mutually decided to end the affair. [...] "Never in a million years could you have told me that [...] would happen," [...] Nicks later stated. [...] "Everybody was angry, because Mick was married to a wonderful girl and had two wonderful children. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrified.</b> I loved these people. I loved his family. So it couldn't possibly work out. And it didn't. I just couldn't." [...] Boyd and Fleetwood had in fact begun living together once more in 1976, and would remarry temporarily to assist their children with emigration to the United States. However they quickly divorced for the second time some months later. In November 1978 Fleetwood moved into a Bel Air home with Sara Recor, mutual friend of Fleetwood and Nicks who was at the time married to another music producer. Meanwhile, Fleetwood began working on a charity project to get Fleetwood Mac to tour the Soviet Union, however the Soviet War in Afghanistan later made the tour untenable.|$|E
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{shocked by}} Ruth Herschberger's {{malicious}} account of my play Benito Cereno[...] [...]It is perfectly clear that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>horrified</b> by the American tendency to violence when in panic, {{and that is}} what the ending of my play--the killing of the slaves and their leader on the mutinied ship--means[...] [...]Ruth Herschberger's notion that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> Captain Delano and wish to put down the present Negro revolt either by guns or by anything else is slanderous. In my poem [...] " [...] the Union Dead" [...] I lament the loss of the old abolitionist spirit; the terrible injustice, in the past and in the present, of the American treatment of the Negro is of the greatest urgency to me as a man and as a writer.|$|R
60|$|You may {{imagine that}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> no unmoved spectator of these proceedings; {{to all the}} others it was a thing to {{which they had been}} {{accustomed}} from their youth up; but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so <b>horrified</b> that <b>I</b> could not help telling the king how it struck me.|$|R
5000|$|I try {{to catch}} the seagull with a silken cord but I find that the soft cord becomes a fagged iron chain which tears my hands. The gull flies out to sea where it sits brooding. I see it fly back to the beach to join a lazy crowd of gulls where it is fed on human flesh by tanks and guns. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>horrified</b> by the greedy eagerness of the {{speckled}} young birds. I find I cannot escape from the chain unless I have to offer my flesh to the gulls. I wait ... thinking of death and living death. I decide that out of living death I may see the gull dive into the sea once more.|$|R
60|$|And {{there they}} were fast again. I heard my master {{mounting}} the stairs--the cold sweat ran from my forehead: <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrified.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrified</b> by his words, but, after all, {{there are}} no ladies on the high seas, and what did it matter? He rang for the steward.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrified</b> for I {{had heard}} nothing of his illness. I need {{not say that}} I rushed for my coat and my hat. As we drove back I asked for the details.|$|E
60|$|I {{must never}} deny that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> greatly <b>horrified</b> by so much baseness, and much {{unmanned}} by the immediacy and ugliness of my danger. Mr. Simon had already gloried in the changes of my hue; I make no doubt <b>I</b> <b>was</b> now no ruddier than my shirt; my speech besides trembled.|$|R
5000|$|Rey later reminisced: [...] "When I {{saw that}} he {{outlined}} my head entirely in green (he had only two main colors, red and green), that he painted my hair and my mustache--I really did not have red hair--in a blazing red on a biting green background, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> simply <b>horrified</b> ..." ...|$|R
6000|$|She stood {{a minute}} irresolute, {{and then she}} began again: [...] "Mr. Chung, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> too <b>horrified</b> to know what I ought to do. I can't grasp it and {{take it all in}} so quickly. If you had money of your own, would you be able to run away and live somehow?" ...|$|R
60|$|My first {{concern was}} with Perry. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrified</b> {{at the thought}} that upon the very {{threshold}} of salvation he might be dead. Tearing open his shirt I placed my ear to his breast. I could have cried with relief--his heart was beating quite regularly.|$|E
6000|$|I shrugged my shoulders. [...] "I am {{bound to}} believe it was for the same reason. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrified,</b> at any rate, by the whole story. I was {{extremely}} shocked at the Countess's want of dignity in continuing to see the man by whose hand her husband had fallen." ...|$|E
60|$|Once {{they were}} below {{much longer than}} usual, and {{when they came to}} the surface <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrified</b> to see that one of the girl's arms was gone--gnawed {{completely}} off at the shoulder--but the poor thing gave no indication of realizing pain, only the horror in her set eyes seemed intensified.|$|E
5000|$|In {{response}} to outrage to the campaign, Jonathon Van Maren, {{spokesperson for the}} group said: “Frankly, <b>I</b> hope (people) <b>are</b> shocked. <b>I</b> hope they <b>are</b> <b>horrified.</b> What our pictures do is show that while choice is obviously a precious liberty, some choices are wrong.” ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1964, Ruth Herschberger wrote a {{controversial}} review of [...] "Benito Cereno" [...] in The Village Voice {{in which she}} accused Lowell of racism (a charge that has also been aimed at Herman Melville regarding his novella Benito Cereno), and she interpreted his play as being a statement against the Civil Rights Movement. Lowell <b>was</b> <b>horrified</b> by the accusation and responded with the following letter to the editors of The Village Voice: [...] <b>I</b> <b>am</b> shocked by Ruth Herschberger's malicious account of my play Benito Cereno[...] [...]It is perfectly clear that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>horrified</b> by the American tendency to violence when in panic, {{and that is what}} the ending of my play--the killing of the slaves and their leader on the mutinied ship--means[...] [...]Ruth Herschberger's notion that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> Captain Delano and wish to put down the present Negro revolt either by guns or by anything else is slanderous.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> so {{innocent}} {{that only}} Dora's passion {{with her brother}} revealed to me his meaning, and then <b>I</b> <b>was</b> inexpressibly <b>horrified</b> and angry, for I did not think Harold could have broken his own word or the faith on which I had taken up my abode with them, and the disappointment in him, embittered, I fear, by the sense of personal injury, was almost unbearable.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrified</b> by {{my first}} glimpse of Holmes next morning, for he sat by the fire holding his tiny {{hypodermic}} syringe. I associated that instrument with the single weakness of his nature, and I feared the worst when I saw it glittering in his hand. He laughed at my expression of dismay and laid it upon the table.|$|E
60|$|I made {{no reply}} for some time. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrified</b> at my comrade's levity in such circumstances. Then, as I heard him {{continue}} to chuckle and remark in an undertone on the surprise the serpent would get on discovering the exceeding toughness of his toe, {{it for the}} first time flashed across my mind that his sufferings had deranged my dear companion's intellect.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I was," [...] I {{answered}} {{on the spur}} of the moment, and I now think wisely. [...] "Shocked is hardly the word. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>horrified</b> beyond anything that words can convey that you--you should have to so endure! I did not like to return, for I feared lest my doing so might set some barrier between us. But in due time I did return on another day." ...|$|E
5000|$|The bloodiest {{events of}} the battle have been {{recorded}} by Johann Dietz of Brandenburg, an army doctor in the besieging army:" [...] [...] [...] Not even the babies in their mother's wombs were spared. All were sent to their deaths. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> quite <b>horrified</b> by what <b>was</b> done here. Men were far more cruel to each other than wild beasts (Bestien)." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I ought, no doubt, to {{have waited}} to see you at Windygates, and to have told you at once of what had happened. But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> weak and ill and the shock of hearing what I heard fell so heavily on me that I fainted. After I came to myself <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so <b>horrified,</b> when <b>I</b> thought of you and Blanche that a sort of madness possessed me. I had but one idea--the idea of running away and hiding myself.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{too much}} <b>horrified</b> to do {{anything}} but hide my eyes and pray. I thought I did not do so obviously, but Hester saw or guessed, stamped at me, and said, [...] "Don't; I will not have it done. It is mockery!" ...|$|R
