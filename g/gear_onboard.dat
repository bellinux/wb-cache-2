40|$|Este trabalho teve por objetivo desenvolver subsídios para propor um procedimento alternativo para aquisição de dados, telemetria, monitoramento e georeferenciamento das atividades agrícolas, por meio da acoplagem de equipamentos eletrônicos a um Veículo Aéreo Não-Tripulado (VANT). Para tal, foi desenvolvido um VANT na Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, no qual foram acoplados equipamentos para a coleta de imagens e a aquisição de pontos de referência. O equipamento desenvolvido mostrou imenso potencial para ser utilizado como ferramenta auxiliar na localização de áreas com falhas de germinação, na infestação de invasoras e no mapeamento de área. O maior entrave a um melhor emprego deste equipamento refere-se à baixa qualidade das imagens geradas, mostrando a necessidade de reavaliações do aparato utilizado. The aim of {{this study}} {{consisted}} in developing and testing an alternative procedure for data acquisition, telemetry, monitoring and geo-referencing in agricultural fields. The proposed approach was implemented by placing dedicated electronic <b>gear</b> <b>onboard</b> Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). For this purpose an UAV was assembled at the Federal University in Santa Maria, Brazil and equipped with the required hardware for image and control points acquisition. Tests have shown that the proposed approach can be regarded as a valuable tool to detect areas affected by faulty germination, weed infestation and mapping in general. The tests have also shown that poor quality of the acquired image data was the main drawback in the equipment onboard the UAV, pointing to the need to reevaluate the system with regard to this particular aspect...|$|E

40|$|Technical {{efficiency}} (TE) {{measures the}} relationship between a vessel's inputs to the fishing process and its outputs, with full efficiency being achieved when outputs are maximised from a given set of inputs. Inputs can be fixed (e. g. the vessel, <b>gear,</b> engine, <b>onboard</b> equipment, etc.) or variable (e. g. time spent fishing, size of crew). Fixed inputs may also be intangible, such as skipper skill and quality differences between technologies. TE scores can be calculated using the econometric stochastic production frontier (SPF) or the non-stochastic, linear-programming data envelopment analysis (DEA) methodologies. This paper compares the results of both techniques for segments of the English Channel fisheries. The influence of factors most affecting technical efficiency is analysed using an SPF inefficiency model and tobit regression of DEA-derived scores. Such factors include vessel and skipper characteristics. It is argued that DEA can be used as an alternative to SPF techniques when there is difficulty in specifying the correct SPF model. There is general consistency between SPF and DEA analyses in regard to the factors affecting TE...|$|R

Inputs can be physical (e. g. the vessel, <b>gear,</b> engine, <b>onboard</b> equipment, etc.), flexible (time spent fishing, size of crew) and also heavily influenced by skipper skill. Finally, there will always be an element of luck and other unaccountable factors involved.

5000|$|A {{number of}} {{theories}} {{suggest that the}} disappearance {{may have been the}} result of a cockpit, cargo compartment, landing <b>gear,</b> or other <b>onboard</b> fire. [...] In an earlier incident involving a Boeing 777, on 29 July 2011, EgyptAir Flight 667 suffered an intense oxygen-fed cockpit fire while still on the ground which destroyed the flight controls and instruments and burnt a hole through the skin of the aircraft. Despite the arrival of firefighters within three minutes, the fire took 90 minutes to extinguish. Malaysia Air's maintenance records for the 777 aircraft are required to include information on whether the FAA-mandated fix to the wiring near the co-pilot's oxygen hose and replacement of the oxygen hose with one with no metallic components was performed.|$|R
40|$|Modern wild-capture marine {{fisheries}} are underpinned {{by energy}} derived from fossil fuels. This energy {{is required for}} vessel propulsion and <b>gear</b> operation, <b>onboard</b> processing, freezing and refrigeration, and producing electricity for ancillary services. Fuel use is the primary driver of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from marine fisheries, and the second highest cost to fishers globally after labour. Fuel consumption has received increased attention from industry, consumers, governments, and environmental organizations in response to higher and more unpredictable energy prices {{and the need to}} reduce GHG emissions to mitigate climate change. A large and growing amount of research has been undertaken {{since the beginning of the}} 21 st century to measure, characterize, and reduce energy use and GHG emissions in fishing fleets. This thesis provides an overview of the magnitude of fuel consumption in marine wild-capture fisheries, assesses how and why fuel consumption and GHG emissions vary between vessels, fleets, and national industries, and discusses the environmental and economic implications of energy use in fisheries at global, regional, and local scales. The global-scale research here involved the synthesis and analysis of data pertaining to fuel use in fisheries. Data from all available primary and secondary sources were compiled in a global fisheries and energy use database (FEUD). Observed rates of fuel inputs to global fisheries were characterized by target species, primary gear type, and region. Fuel use rates were then used as a proxy to estimate GHG emissions from national and global fishing fleets, assess the relative emissions from different sectors of the global fishing fleet, and track emissions from the industry from 1990 to 2011. World fisheries in 2011 consumed 40 billion litres of fuel and emitted 168 million tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent GHGs to the atmosphere. Energy performance varied between fisheries by three orders of magnitude, with crustacean fisheries consuming vastly more fuel than fisheries targeting small pelagic forage fish. Regional-scale research applied cost and revenue data to estimate the fuel use intensity (FUI) of a range of Australian fisheries and compare environmental (emissions) and economic (costs) roles of fuel use. Australian fisheries followed similar patterns to global fisheries, with all of the more fuel-intensive fisheries targeting rock lobsters and prawns, while the more efficient fisheries targeted small pelagics. The economic role of fuel also varied markedly, although fuel costs as a percentage of fishing revenue did not consistently correlate with consumption rates. Fuel expenditures in Australian fisheries ranged from 2...|$|R
