A novel method of shaping <b>sheet</b> <b>glass</b> is presented. This method reduces the surface waviness of a <b>glass</b> <b>sheet</b> and changes its shape while it is in its hot state and without contacting its surface. A <b>sheet</b> of <b>glass</b> is inserted between two parallel porous mandrels such that it is at a predefined distance from the two. A thin layer of pressurized gas flows through each mandrel and out against the glass surfaces. The resulting viscous flow against the heated soft <b>glass</b> <b>sheet</b> changes its surface topography. By using flat mandrels and controlled pressurized gas at temperatures close to 600 °C, the outcome is a flat <b>sheet</b> of <b>glass</b> with its original immaculate optical qualities. The flow in porous mandrels and the resulting pressure distribution along the surfaces of a <b>glass</b> <b>sheet</b> inserted between two porous mandrels is modeled. The design and manufacturing of an apparatus used to reduce the surface waviness of <b>glass</b> <b>sheets</b> at elevated temperatures is described. (cont.) The apparatus designed addresses individual sheets; however, guidelines on how to incorporate this method of shaping glass in a continuous <b>glass</b> <b>sheet</b> manufacturing facility are provided.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Sheet</b> <b>glass</b> powder (SGP) used in {{concrete}} making leads to greener environment. In shops, near by Chidamba-ram many <b>sheet</b> <b>glass</b> cuttings go to waste, {{which are not}} recycled at present and usually delivered to landfills for disposal. Using SGP {{in concrete}} is an interesting possibility for economy on waste disposal sites and conservation of natural re-sources. This paper examines {{the possibility of using}} SGP as a replacement in fine aggregate for a new concrete. Natural sand was partially replaced (10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 % and 50 %) with SGP. Compressive strength, Tensile strength (cubes and cylinders) and Flexural strength up to 180 days of age were compared with those of concrete made with natural fine aggregates. Fineness modulus, specific gravity, moisture content, water absorption, bulk density, %voids, % porosity (loose and compact) state for sand (S) and SDA were also studied. The test results indicate {{that it is possible to}} manufac-ture concrete containing <b>Sheet</b> <b>glass</b> powder (SGP) with characteristics similar to those of natural sand aggregate concrete provided that the percentage of SGP as fine aggregate is limited to 10 - 20 %, respectively...|$|R
