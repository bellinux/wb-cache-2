40|$|The {{weld metal}} {{produced}} {{from a series}} of high productivity welds of 316 LN austenitic stainless steel plate was examined to evaluate the effects of the use of a higher heat input process (> 2. 5 kJ/mm). This high heat input process was aimed at maximising single sided weld metal penetration in a single pass using simple square <b>edge</b> <b>preparations</b> and minimising time consuming handling operations. The evaluation was undertaken by correlating the local microstructure with the local toughness and microhardness of the cap, middle and root of the weld. It was established that the intermetallic phases / carbides present did not appear to have a significantly adverse effect on either corrosion or toughness. The phases observed and confirmed by the use of SAED were predominantly chi (χ) with some sigma(σ). No identifications were made of M 23 C 6 which was observed in other studies of 316 LN welds. A series of impact tests with variations in the notch positions showed that the thickness of the delta ferrite had an effect on the weld metal toughness. As a result of this work it was established that similar volume fractions of delta ferrite did not necessarily produce similar levels of weld metal toughness, but ferrite thickness did appear to have a contributory effect. Welding of 316 LN stainless steel with a single sided single pass submerged arc welding process was satisfactorily undertaken up to 20 mm plate thickness without preheat or post weld heat treatment.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} the influence of welding on microstructure, mechanical properties, and stress corrosion cracking resistance of dissimilar stainless steels butt welded joints. Design/methodology/approach: Duplex 2205 and austenitic 316 L steels were used. Butt joints of plates 15 mm in thickness were performed with the use of submerged arc welding (SAW) method. The heat input was in the range of 1. 15 – 3. 2 kJ/mm. Various plates’ <b>edge</b> <b>preparations</b> were applied. Microstructure examinations were carried out. Mechanical properties were evaluated in tensile tests, bending tests and Charpy-V toughness tests. Susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking was determined with the use of slow strain rate tests (SSRT) performed in inert (glycerin) and aggressive (boiling 35 % MgCl 2 solution) environments. Findings: All tested joints showed acceptable mechanical properties. Metallographic examinations did not indicate the excessive ferrite contents in heat affected zones (HAZ) of the welds. It was shown that area of the lowest resistance to stress corrosion cracking is heat affected zone at duplex steel side of dissimilar joins. That phenomenon is connected with undesirable structure of that zone consisted of greater amounts of coarse ferrite grains and acicular austenite precipitates. High heat inputs do not deteriorate mechanical properties as well as stress corrosion cracking resistance of welds. Practical implications: All tested joints showed acceptable mechanical properties.

Analysis of the production of machine parts of various branches of engineering have shown that various types of finishing processing is subjected to 85 - 95 % of parts produced, the complexity of these operations is 10 - 20 % of the overall complexity of manufacturing. Today, one of the ways engineering is a manufacturer of machine parts high quality, durability and reliability which largely depend on the accuracy of their production, the optimal physical and mechanical properties of surface layers of the mating surfaces. This, in turn, requires improved methods of finishing, especially in the finishing operations, expansion of production capabilities, introducing them to new technological processes. Among the productive methods of performing finishing (and grinding) operations, there is a vibration processing method, which is characterized by providing high quality machined surfaces and wide versatility of the vibration machine. However, when vibration processing small flat parts, there is uneven treatment of their surfaces from sticking together in the package and buildup {{on the walls of the}} vibrating container. All this requires exploration of new technological opportunities of the vibration treatment, characterized by higher intensity and performance, high quality, new methods, contributing to the elimination of build-up detail on the sides of the container and sticking them together in the process.
