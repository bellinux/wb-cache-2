5|$|With a {{population}} of 4.29million in 2011, Croatia ranks 125th {{in the world by}} population. Its population density is 75.8 inhabitants per square kilometre. The overall life expectancy in Croatia at birth is 78 years. The total fertility rate of 1.50 children per mother is one of the lowest in the world. Since 1991, Croatia's death rate has nearly continuously exceeded its birth rate. The Croatian Bureau of Statistics forecast that the population may even shrink to 3.1million by 2051, depending on the actual birth rate and the level of net migration. The population of Croatia rose steadily from 2.1million in 1857 until 1991, when it peaked at 4.7million, with the exception of censuses taken in 1921 and 1948, i.e. following two world wars. The natural growth rate of the population is negative. Croatia started advancing from the first stage of the <b>demographic</b> <b>transition</b> in the late 18th and early 19th centuries (depending on where in Croatia is being discussed). Croatia is in the fourth or fifth stage of the <b>demographic</b> <b>transition.</b>|$|E
5|$|More recently, Taylor (1992) pointed {{that the}} {{relatively}} high dependency ratio and the slow <b>demographic</b> <b>transition</b> in Argentina led to a reliance on foreign capital to offset the resulting low savings rate. From the 1930s onwards, the accumulation of capital was hampered by {{the relatively high}} prices of (mostly imported) capital goods, which {{was caused by the}} industrial policy of import substitution, in contrast with the export-led growth favoured by Canada. Other distorting factors behind the high relative prices of capital goods include the multiple exchange rates, the black market for foreign currencies, the depreciation of the national currency and high customs tariffs. This resulted in a lower capital intensity, which led to lower rates of labour productivity.|$|E

40|$|This lecture {{explores the}} {{connection}} between <b>demographic</b> <b>transitions,</b> mass migrations and international capital flows. It reviews how <b>demographic</b> <b>transitions</b> influence the size of age cohorts, and then how these changes in age distribution influence excess demands in receiving regions and excess supplies in sending regions. The lecture offers four examples - two from the first global century and two from the second global century - where shocks generated by <b>demographic</b> <b>transitions</b> have had {{an enormous impact on}} factor flows: European mass migrations to the New World before 1914; African mass migrations to the OECD over the past two decades; British capital export to the New World before 1914; and capital flows across East Asian borders after 1950 and before the melt down of the 1990 s. The lecture concludes with an assessment of the demographic contribution to the East Asian miracle (and slowdown) over the past half century.

5|$|The {{demographic}} characteristics of the population of Croatia are known through censuses, normally conducted in ten-year intervals and analysed by various statistical bureaus since the 1850s. The Croatian Bureau of Statistics has performed this task since the 1990s. The latest census in Croatia was performed in April 2011. The permanent population of Croatia at the 2011 census had reached 4.29 million. The population density is 75.8 inhabitants per square kilometre, and the overall life expectancy in Croatia at birth was 78 years in 2012. The population rose steadily (with the exception of censuses taken following the two world wars) from 2.1 million in 1857 until 1991, when it peaked at 4.7 million. Since 1991, Croatia's death rate has continuously exceeded its birth rate; the natural growth rate of the population is negative. Croatia is in the fourth or fifth stage of the <b>demographic</b> <b>transition.</b> In terms of age structure, the population is dominated by the 15‑ to 64‑year‑old segment. The median age of the population is 41.4, and the gender ratio of the total population is 0.93 males per 1 female.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Wales doubled from 587,000 in 1801 to 1,163,000 in 1851 and had reached 2,421,000 by 1911. Most {{of the increase}} came in the coal mining districts, especially Glamorganshire, which grew from 71,000 in 1801 to 232,000 in 1851 and 1,122,000 in 1911. Part of this increase {{can be attributed to}} the <b>demographic</b> <b>transition</b> seen in most industrialising countries during the Industrial Revolution, as death rates dropped and birth rates remained steady. However, there was also large-scale migration into Wales during the Industrial Revolution. The English were the most numerous group, but there were also considerable numbers of Irish and smaller numbers of other ethnic groups, including Italians, who migrated to South Wales. Wales also received immigration from various parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations in the 20th century, and African-Caribbean and Asian communities add to the ethno-cultural mix, particularly in urban Wales. Many of these self-identify as Welsh.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Compared {{to other}} factors, {{the role of}} the age {{distribution}} of the population as a key endogenous determinant of economic growth trajectories has traditionally been overlooked. This is unrealistic, especially when dealing with major epochs of structural change, such as <b>demographic</b> <b>transitions.</b> We set up a model combining a simple representation of the economy, based on the neoclassical growth model of Solow, with a comprehensive representation of population dynamics. The model is used to investigate the structure of balanced growth states of the population and the economy in the presence of <b>demographic</b> <b>transitions.</b> The analysis shows that proper inclusion of age structure enriches the spectrum of the long-run equilibria of the neoclassical model, allowing up to five states of balanced growth, and shows the onset of “poverty” and “low-fertility” traps as different facets of fertility transitions. The role of different timing of fertility, mortality and savings transitions, and of more realistic demography of capital, is also considered...|$|R
25|$|The <b>demographic</b> <b>transition</b> model, in isolation, can {{be taken}} to predict that birth rates will {{continue}} to go down as societies grow increasingly wealthy; however, recent data contradicts this, suggesting that beyond a certain level of development birth rates increase again. In addition, in the very long term, the <b>demographic</b> <b>transition</b> should be reversed via evolutionary pressure for higher fertility and higher mortality.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} extent and policy {{implications}} of linkages between demographic changes and international factor mobility. Evidence is found of significant demographic effects on both migration and the current account, but for different reasons neither increased migration nor international transfers of savings is expected to offer much assistance in digesting the variety of <b>demographic</b> <b>transitions</b> expected over the next fifty years. The paper also examines more briefly the effects of demography on the factor content of international trade, as exemplified by offshore provision of back-office and other services previously provided closer to home. When considering the consequences of using international capital movements and especially migration to mediate international differences in demographic patterns, I broaden the focus from the usual economic variables, such as the size and distribution of incomes and employment, to consider explicit measures of well-being, which {{have been shown to}} depend on far more than economic variables. This has implications for a whole range of policies, both domestic and international, that might help deal with national and global <b>demographic</b> <b>transitions.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|OVER THE PAST century {{virtually}} all countries have made rapid progress through their <b>demographic</b> <b>transitions,</b> {{as reflected in}} large declines in birth and death rates. Population growth has been rapid, because reductions in death rates preceded declines in birth rates.

The populations of the industrialized world (the “North”) have essentially completed their transitions, 1 and, even including immigration, the average rate of population growth in the North is only a fraction of one percent per year. In contrast, in much of the developing world (the “South”), population growth continues at a high pace, despite substantial reductions in fertility over the past several decades.

25|$|The {{existence}} {{of some kind}} of <b>demographic</b> <b>transition</b> is widely accepted in the social sciences because of the well-established historical correlation linking dropping fertility to social and economic development.
