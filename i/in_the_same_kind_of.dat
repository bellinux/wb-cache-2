The verb typically occurs {{at the end of}} a clause (after the subject and direct object, in that order), and main clauses typically follow dependent clauses. The possessor precedes the possessum.

The words that correspond to prepositions in languages like English are usually constrained to appear before the verb; in noun phrases they appear following their complement.|$|E
25|$|Humanity {{discovered}} {{the ruins of}} one alien technological civilization, and encountered one {{that at the time}} of the story is alive and thriving, the Ashiyyur. The sphere of Ashiyyur worlds is described by the author as abutting the worlds of human civilization along the Perimeter – first contact was made at least several hundred years before the time in which the back-story is set. McDevitt conceives the Ashiyyur as being at approximately the same technological level as humans, and in fact humanoid – bi-laterally symmetrical, bipedal, larger than average for human, of two genders, descended from predators, and interested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> real estate as humans. Most significantly for the story, they are also incapable of audible speech without mechanical aids, and are nicknamed “Mutes” by humans as a result. The Ashiyyur are telepathic and have evolved a society based on that form of communication. They have the ability, with some difficulty, to “read” human minds and emotions. Ashiyyur civilization is described as being much older than human civilization (approximately 75,000 years versus perhaps 15,000) but as having developed much more slowly. It is important to the back-story that to the Ashiyyur, human dynamism and exuberance appear threatening and humans are aggressive, untrustworthy, and unethical.|$|E

David McGrath, emeritus professor of English, College of DuPage, discussed his own decision to attend Chicago State University in the 24 July 2007 Chicago Tribune article, Ode to a fourth-tier college. Of this decision, he noted that, [...] "I qualified for admission elsewhere, but CSU was close to my part-time job, and it was cheap [...] I never required a student loan since I earned enough as a grocery bagger to pay tuition and fees in 1970 that totaled $300 per year. All told, a pretty good value, even for a fourth-tier school." [...] McGrath considered it a [...] "good value," [...] because, [...] "CSU eventually led to a teaching career, and my working alongside professors from Princeton, Northwestern, and the University of Chicago.

2500|$|During the 2012 presidential {{election}} campaign, Romney took positions on agricultural subsidies that some media reports characterized as vague and somewhat contradictory. In May 2011, {{just days after}} rival Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty had declared that federal subsidies {{for the production of}} ethanol fuel should be phased out, Romney said that he was a supporter of ethanol subsidies. Five months later, while speaking on agricultural subsidies at a roundtable discussion with Iowa farmers and business leaders, Romney said, “I’m not running for office based on making promises of handing out money.... We’re {{going to have to live}} within our means.” He also said that while he had supported ethanol subsidies in the past in order to help the ethanol fuel industry become established, and that he continued to believe that ethanol should play a role in meeting the nation’s energy needs, he agreed with the discontinuation of the tax credit for production of ethanol from corn that was scheduled to occur two months later. On the subject of agricultural subsidies more generally, Romney wrote in response to a 2012 questionnaire from the American Farm Bureau Federation that [...] "other nations subsidize their farmers, so we [...] must be careful not to unilaterally change our policies in a way that would [...] disadvantage agriculture here in our country." [...] He made similar remarks on the campaign trail in August 2012, without explicitly referring to subsidies: [...] "We don't want to find ourselves with regards to our food supply <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> position we are in with our energy supply, so it's important for us to make sure that our farmers are able to stay on the farm and raise the crops that we need to have a secure source of food.

These proteins have been characterised as major regulators of lamellipodia formation downstream of Rac activation and as members of large protein complexes. Results We have investigated the interactions of the three human Scar/WAVE isoforms with several previously described binding partners for Scar/WAVE 1 or 2. We find that all three Scar/WAVE isoforms behave similarly {{and are likely to}} participate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>kinds</b> of protein complexes that regulate actin assembly.
