5|$|Around 1670, {{the church}} was refurbished, a gallery was built at {{the western end of}} the nave, and the carved reredos and a large wooden Royal coat of arms, now at the west end of the nave, were {{acquired}} at the same time. An <b>inspection</b> <b>report</b> {{at the end of the}} 18th century commented on the dirty transept walls, and the need to install the equivalent of a cattle grid to keep pigs out of the churchyard. Rich crimson hangings in the church had earlier attracted the attention of a thief. The increasing congregation led to the replacement of the pews and the construction of galleries down both sides of the building in 1829, but a more extensive rebuilding was undertaken in 1878–80, by James Piers St Aubyn. The galleries were removed and the two outer aisles were added during this period, a chapel was converted to a vestry and improvements were made to the Hastings Chapel. The cost of these works has been estimated as between £16,000 and more than £18,000. Later developments included the expenditure of £13,000 between 1963 and 1968 to combat deathwatch beetles found during rewiring, improvements to the heating system, and a rededication in 1974, the quincentenary of the church.|$|E

Over {{the next three years}} there was much talk of the need for a single note-issuing bank and for a reduction in the note circulation.

Examination of the wreckage showed electrical arcing on the basket {{and one of the}} four propane cylinders, consistent with a power line strike. Details about the maintenance and record-keeping of the balloon were released. The most recent inspection had occurred on 14 September 2011, with several errors made in the records and inspection. The <b>inspection</b> <b>report</b> erroneously recorded the type certificate as B2GL, which is applicable to Cameron Balloons United States for serial numbers 5000 and higher – ZK-XXF was manufactured in the United Kingdom and was serial number 4300, so the correct type certificate was BB12. It also recorded the basket and burners as being of Cameron Balloons, not as being of Thunder and Colt. Anomalies were also identified in the maintenance logbook, including incorrect identification of the basket and burners, no record of four airworthiness directives, and no entry regarding the use of the gas bottles. The maintenance provider was also found to be using outdated versions of the Flight and Maintenance Manuals, using the 1992-released Issue 7 rather than the current Issue 10, and that the maintainers had tested the strength of the envelope by hand, rather than the prescribed method of using a spring gauge to measure actual strength.|$|E

500|$|John Vaizey (The Spectator) spotlighted the book's {{emphasis}} on [...] "the innate goodness of children" [...] {{and how the}} progressive school movement's {{emphasis on}} freedom had spread into the public schools. Vaizey put Neill's Summerhill in a disappearing lineage of post-World War I experimental schools that focused on freedom from directed games, classics curriculum, and prudery. He wrote in 1962 that [...] "Summerhill is clearly one of England's greatest schools" [...] and that the decline of this experimental school tradition was a tragedy. Still, Deutsch (Journal of Individual Psychology) wrote that Summerhill had not been [...] "duplicated" [...] in the four decades since its creation. The Booklist noted Neill's [...] "scant credit" [...] awarded to prior progressive and experimental schools, and added that {{the addition of a}} British <b>inspection</b> <b>report</b> added objective credibility to the book.

Grunsfeld and Feustel suited up {{with the assistance of}} their EVA counterparts, Massimino and Good, and the spacewalk officially began when the two switched their suits to battery power at 12:52 UTC. At the start of the spacewalk, Feustel provided managers on the ground with a visual <b>inspection</b> <b>report</b> on the particulate matter seen earlier around the WFC3 box, reporting to the ground team that [...] "I don't really see any of those particles...It's almost imperceivable. I can see some few particles {{on the front of the}} W-SIPE, little, whitish, grey looking, real small. It's low density, too." [...] After getting their tools and equipment for the EVA set up, Grunsfeld and Feustel removed the old Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2, which was installed in 1993 during the telescope's first servicing mission, and replaced it with the new Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3). Feustel initially had trouble removing the bolts from the old camera, which after over fifteen years in space required more torque to remove than expected. After multiple attempts, managers on the ground decided to have Grunsfeld get a contingency torque limiter from the airlock, which would allow Feustel to apply more force without exceeding a specific point, but the bolt would still not release. The concern was that the bolt would shear, and the camera would be unable to be removed should that happened. Finally, managers approved Feustel to remove the limiter, and apply as much force as he safely thought it would take to release the bolt, which was successful.|$|E
