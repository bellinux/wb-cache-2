5|$|However, {{the retreat}} went awry. The Allied contingents in the centre missed their {{appointed}} position {{and ended up}} scattered in front of Plataea itself. The Athenians, Tegeans and Spartans, who had been guarding {{the rear of the}} retreat, had not <b>even</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> retreat by daybreak. A single Spartan division was thus left on the ridge to guard the rear, while the Spartans and Tegeans retreated uphill; Pausanias also instructed the Athenians to begin the retreat and if possible join up with the Spartans. However, the Athenians at first retreated directly towards Plataea, and thus the Allied battle line remained fragmented as the Persian camp began to stir.|$|E
25|$|MSF {{first set}} up a field mission in Côte d'Ivoire in 1990, but ongoing {{violence}} and the 2002 division of the country by rebel groups and the government led to several massacres, and MSF teams have <b>even</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> suspect that an ethnic cleansing is occurring. Mass measles vaccinations, tuberculosis treatment and the re-opening of hospitals closed by fighting are projects run by MSF, {{which is the only}} group providing aid in much of the country.|$|E
25|$|There, in May 1850, he {{once again}} took up Siegfried's Tod. He {{prepared}} a third fair {{copy of the}} libretto (Viertschrift des Textbuches) for publication, which, however, did not take place, and by July he had <b>even</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> compose music for the prologue. Of this music a sheet of preliminary sketches survives and a more detailed composition draft, which extends about {{one quarter of the}} way into the duet between Brünnhilde and Siegfried. Having reached this point, however, Wagner abandoned the work.|$|E

25|$|The {{public in}} Boston and Lowell {{continued}} to attribute Kinney and Freeman's deaths to Hanson despite the court declaring her not guilty, and rumors had <b>even</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> attribute {{the death of}} Freeman's father to Hanson as well. Hanson's father-in-law, Mr. Freeman had died suddenly while Hanson and Freeman had been visiting him following their wedding. In 1841, Kinney published her autobiography, A Review of the Principal Events of the Last Ten Years in the Life of Mrs. Hannah Kinney: Together with Some Comments upon the Late Trial, Written by Herself to combat rumors of her guilt. In response, her ex-husband Ward Witham, published a biography of Hannah, entitled Life of Mrs. H. Kinney, for Twenty Years in 1842. He accused her of adultery and slander, but publicize an opinion on the murder trial.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} period of {{exploration}} and development of ideas, premature conference presentations and individual seminars were given by {{various members of the}} Cambridge group in other archaeological departments in England and abroad. Individual scholars who were invited to talk to us in Cambridge in that period often felt, understandably, obliged to maintain a distinct opposition. While it is certainly the case that these presentations had occurred before our views had <b>even</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> settle down, and that they were excessively aggressive, they {{played an important role in}} the process of enquiry and reformulation. In particular, the contrasts which were set up by us and by outside scholars allowed the views of the seminar group, and the differences of viewpoint within the group, to be clarified. The opposition highlighted our own opinion but also threw the spotlight on the blind alleys down which there was a danger of straying. Our aggression resulted from the conviction that we were doing something new. This, too, was important. In the initial period there was a clear idea of what was wrong with existing approaches and there was a faith that something else could be done.|$|E
500|$|Politically, the Austrian Netherlands {{comprised}} {{a number}} of federated and autonomous territories, inherited from the Spanish, which could trace their lineage to the Middle Ages. These territories, known collectively as the Provincial States, retained much of their traditional power over their own internal affairs. The states were dominated by the wealthy and prominent Estates of Brabant and Flanders. The Austrian Governors-General were forced to respect {{the autonomy of the}} provincial states and could only act only with some degree of consent. Within the states themselves, the [...] "traditional" [...] independence was considered extremely important and figures such as Jan-Baptist Verlooy had <b>even</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> claim the linguistic unity of Flemish dialects as a sign of national identity in Flanders.|$|E

Six years after receiving Kawasaki's license to produce Shinkansen E2, CSC Sifang can produce the CRH2A without Japanese input, and Kawasaki has ended cooperation with Sifang on high-speed rail.|$|E

Han Purple was first synthesized over 2,500 years ago, but we have only recently discovered how exotic its magnetic behavior is.

A more extensive prose draft was completed by 1 June, and by 24 June this had {{been transformed into a}} verse draft. By August the fair copy of this verse libretto was finished and Wagner had <b>even</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> set it to music. These efforts, however, never amounted to anything {{more than a handful of}} sketches, which were later used in the composition of Siegfried.|$|E
2500|$|A six-foot five-inch [...] "Blond Giant", Rorke was {{the fastest}} Australian bowler and accused of {{throwing}} by the English press, but this paled beside his excessive dragging. With his gigantic seven-foot stride and dragging his rear foot a yard over the crease {{he could be}} only eighteen yards from the batsman when he finally delivered the ball and at times seemed impossible to score from. Fred Trueman was no balled for dragging his foot {{a couple of inches}} over the crease and wrote [...] "It was really annoying as this umpire seemed to allow Gordon Rorke to bowl with both his feet over the front line!". One picture showed him with his rear foot past the bowling crease before he had <b>even</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> drag. Colin Cowdrey joked [...] "I was frightened that he might tread on my toes".|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the success}} of Holy Grail, reporters asked {{for the title of}} the next Python film, {{despite the fact that the}} team had not <b>even</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> {{consider}} a third one. Eventually, Idle flippantly replied [...] "Jesus Christ – Lust for Glory", which became the group's stock answer once they realised that it shut reporters up. However, they soon began to seriously consider a film lampooning the New Testament era in the same way Holy Grail had lampooned Arthurian legend. Despite them all sharing a distrust of organised religion, they agreed not to mock Jesus or his teachings directly. They also mentioned that they could not think of anything legitimate to make fun of about him. Instead, they decided to write a satire on credulity and hypocrisy among the followers of someone who had been mistaken for the [...] "Messiah", but who had no desire to be followed as such. Chapman was cast in the lead role of Brian.|$|E
