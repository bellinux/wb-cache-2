The division between craft and industry is not so wide as might at first be imagined. It is interesting to observe that the main problems faced by the mass-production bookbinder are the same as those that confronted the medieval craftsman or the modern hand binder. The first problem is still <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> together the pages of a book; secondly is how to cover and protect the gathering of pages once they are held together; and thirdly, how to label and decorate the protective cover.|$|E

His half-sister, Erica, stages an intervention with his friends to have him confront his problems. They practice a tough love-policy that has Mark admit to the addiction. The informative episode showed <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> an intervention, and the stages to go through for a successful confrontation. On March 18, 1985, the episode of All My Children included the scene while Erica Kane (Susan Lucci) met and became friends with Stephen J.

25|$|In recent years, Sacred Harp singing has {{experienced}} a resurgence in popularity, as it is discovered by new participants who did not {{grow up in the}} tradition. New singers typically strive to follow the original southern customs at their singings. Traditional singers have responded to this need by providing help in orienting the newcomers. For instance, the Rudiments section of the 1991 Denson edition includes information on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> a singing; this information would be superfluous in a traditional context, but is important for a group starting up on its own. The tradition of the singing master is still carried on today, and singing masters from traditional Sacred Harp regions often travel outside the South to teach. In recent years an annual summer camp has been established, at which newcomers can learn to sing Sacred Harp.|$|E

500|$|According to Carter, it {{was evident}} that The X-Files was a [...] "series in making" [...] during this episode. The episode was {{inspired}} by common ufology. Believers in aliens have long thought that Nevada's Area 51 and Nellis Air Force Base have alien technology captured during 1947's Roswell UFO incident. The name Ellens Air Force Base was derived from the name of Carter's college girlfriend, whose last name was Ellens. The story's military project was inspired by a rumor that the United States Air Force had started a project named the Aurora Project. Carter said he remembered people talking about this rumor and that its inclusion in the story was a [...] "nod" [...] to it. The surname for the two guest characters, Budahas, came from a high school friend of Carter. Duchovny and Anderson had never used a gun or held one before, so they were trained on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> them properly.|$|E
500|$|With this [...] "the public, {{press and}} {{political}} parties quickly {{turned their attention to}} the case", with the Republican State Committee of Pennsylvania (supported by their Democratic counterparts) and several prominent politicians intervening. They moved to expedite an appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. In a unanimous opinion, the Court of Appeals (consisting of Sloviter, Greenberg and Seitz) confirmed that there was no restriction of any fundamental right, and therefore that the strict scrutiny process {{did not need to be}} applied. In the absence of this process, they held that the Seventeenth Amendment did not require primary elections to fill vacancies, and more broadly gave state legislatures wide discretion as to <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> elections; as such, the statute did not violate the constitution. In December 1991 the Supreme Court denied a writ of certiorari, presumably because the special election had already taken place in November and the issue was thus moot.|$|E

The show has a book by Bill Oakes and is directed by Tamara Harvey, with choreography by Javier De Frutos, orchestrations by David White, set and costume design by Soutra Gilmour, lighting design by Bruno Poet and sound design by Mick Potter. The musical features an original score, with music by Stuart Brayson and lyrics by Tim Rice. The musical adaption marked Rice's first entirely new show since Aida and Brayson's first West End musical. Former US Marine Ray Elliott, also head of the James Jones literary society, was hired to ensure an accurate picture of military life for the era. Elliott read the script to ensure it was realistic, ran military drills, taught the cast how to salute all ranks and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> rifles correctly. The show received its first public outing as part of West End Live in June 2013, with star Robert Lonsdale singing [...] "Fight the Fight".|$|E

500|$|Soderbergh {{found the}} task of researching such a popular {{historical}} figure as Guevara a daunting one: [...] "If you go to any bookstore, you'll find an entire wall of Che-related material. We tried {{to go through all}} of it, we were overwhelmed with information. He means something different to everyone. At a certain point we had to decide for ourselves who Che was". The original source material for these scripts was Guevara's diary from the Cuban Revolution, Reminiscences of the Cuban Revolutionary War, and from his time in Bolivia, Bolivian Diary. From there, he drew on interviews with people who knew Guevara from both of those time periods and read every book available that pertained to both Cuba and Bolivia. Bickford and Del Toro met with Harry [...] "Pombo" [...] Villegas, Urbano and Benigno—three men who met Guevara during the Cuban Revolution, followed him to Bolivia, and survived. They interviewed them individually and then Pombo and Benigno together about their experiences in Cuba and Bolivia. Urbano was an adviser while they were filming in Spain and the actors often consulted with him and the others about specific details, like <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> their guns in a certain situation, and very specific tactical information.|$|E
500|$|According to Joseph, [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] is thematically {{similar to}} [...] "Bills, Bills, Bills" [...] (1999) and [...] "Say My Name" [...] (2000), from the Destiny's Child era. Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times noted that [...] "Freakum Dress" [...] celebrates showing off. Jon Pareles of The New York Times viewed {{the concept of}} the song as not merely having a nice {{wardrobe}} to entice men, but it also serves as [...] "a means of self-assertion." [...] In the song, the female protagonist pulls out her best dress to remind her potentially wandering mate of what he is leaving at home. Jody Rosen of Entertainment Weekly added that Beyoncé also seemingly gives professional advice to women on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> a man's attention in a long-term relationship. She sings: [...] "I think I'm ready/ Been locked up in the house way too long / It's time to get it, cause once again he's out doing wrong [...] Wear very skimpy clothes...". Joseph commented that in the song, Beyoncé is capable of wearing anything to keep her man by her side rather than dumping him. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe added that after having skirted her best dress, Beyoncé eyes other guys in dance clubs to make her own man jealous, in the hope of regaining his attention but she also makes sure that he really pays when he does her wrong. Beyoncé later refers to her [...] "freakum dress" [...] in [...] "Jealous", a track from her fifth studio album Beyoncé (2013).|$|E
500|$|Although Salman Khan was {{initially}} signed {{for the lead}} role, he later withdrew due to creative differences with the director. Shah Rukh Khan (who had originally declined due to a scheduling conflict with Karan Johar's Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna) was later confirmed as Kabir Khan. Khan accepted the role partly because he used to play hockey in college: [...] "I feel hockey as a sport has been monstrously neglected in our country. I used {{to play the game}} during college. In fact, I was quite a good hockey player. So the role was a lot like going back to my past." [...] Some media sources called the actor's role offbeat, since it departed from his usual romantic image and included neither lip synched songs nor a single female lead. Casting of the 16 actresses as the hockey players took over six months. Amin described the process as [...] "very, very difficult" [...] and [...] "very strenuous because the requirement was they had to play – and act". A four-month training camp was held where the girls learned the rules of the game, took acting lessons and followed a strict diet; safety precautions were also taken. According to Amin, [...] "Learning hockey is very tricky unlike, say, football. You have to know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the stick, how to manoeuvre it, so it doesn't look fake on screen ... For those who were originally players, we had {{to make sure they were}} able to act as well. The dialogue was weighty; it isn't frivolous. It has to be delivered with a certain tone, in a certain manner". The actors, including Khan and the rest of the supporting cast, participated in a number of rehearsals and script readings before principal photography began.|$|E
