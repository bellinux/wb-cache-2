40|$|The {{hypoid gear}} has had wide-spread use in {{industrial}} fields, {{but there has}} been no discussion about accurate design methods. for obtaining a satisfactory hypoid tooth form, some kinds o f cutting machines have been made, with individual hypoid design and production system. On the other hand, hypoid <b>gear</b> <b>dimensions</b> cannot be confirmed in the production, and the measuring systems are just their running test with the mating gear. sometimes, plant engineers are quite confused by the hypoid noise trouble. This paper discusses the relationships between the hypoid dimensions and depthwise tooth taper for duplex cutting, and makes it possible to design accurate enough <b>gear</b> <b>dimensions</b> for designing and gear cutting...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} explores the {{validity}} of a recent stages of change (SoC) measure and algorithm among a sample of late adolescents. MANOVA and structural equation modeling are {{used to assess the}} relationship between five SoC groups (precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance) and a set of dependent measures including physical activity level, physical activity motivation, physical self-concept, and flow. Findings are based on 705 Australian adolescents, using scale score and latent variable approaches, provided support for the construct validity of the SoC measure and algorithm. Specifically, findings reveal that participants in the upper SoC (action and maintenance) score significantly higher on positively <b>geared</b> <b>dimensions</b> (e. g., physical self-concept, flow, etc.) and significantly lower on negatively <b>geared</b> <b>dimensions</b> (e. g., maladaptive behavior).

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the properties of}} the Extended Fock Basis (EFB) of Clifford algebras [1] with which one can replace the traditional multivector expansion of Cl(g) with an expansion in terms of simple (also: pure) spinors. We show that a Clifford algebra with 2 m generators is the direct sum of 2 m spinor subspaces S characterized as being left eigenvectors of Γ; furthermore we prove that the well known isomorphism between simple spinors and totally null planes holds only within one of these spinor subspaces. We also show a new symmetry between spinor and vector spaces: similarly to a vector space of <b>dimension</b> 2 <b>m</b> that contains totally null planes of maximal <b>dimension</b> <b>m,</b> also a spinor space of <b>dimension</b> 2 <b>m</b> contains "totally simple planes", sub-spaces made entirely of simple spinors, of maximal <b>dimension</b> <b>m...</b>|$|R

In {{this note}} we give {{examples}} in every <b>dimension</b> <b>m</b> ≥ 9 of piecewise linearly homeomorphic, closed, connected, smooth m-manifolds which admit two smoothness structures with differing spans, stable spans, and immersion co-dimensions. In dimension 15 the {{examples include the}} total spaces of certain 7 -sphere bundles over S 8. The construction of such manifolds {{is based on the}} topological variance of the second Pontrjagin class: a fact which goes back to Milnor and which was used by Roitberg to give examples of span variation in <b>dimensions</b> <b>m</b> ≥ 18. We also show that span does not vary for piecewise linearly homeomorphic smooth manifolds in dimensions {{less than or equal to}} 8, or under connected sum with a smooth homotopy sphere in any dimension.
