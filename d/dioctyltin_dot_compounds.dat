40|$|Organotin {{compounds}} (OTs) are {{ubiquitous in}} the marine environment and high concentrations (mu g g(- 1) range) in sediments from different coastal areas {{around the world have}} been reported. However, few reports have described the OTs contamination status in the offshore and deep sea environment. This work investigated organotin levels in Nazare canyon for the first time. Levels of monobutyltin (MBT), dibutyltin (DBT), tributyltin (TBT), diphenyltin (DPT), triphenyltin (TPT), <b>dioctyltin</b> (<b>DOT)</b> and trioctyltin (TOT) were quantified in sediment samples from the upper flanks of the canyon and from the adjacent coastal area. TBT levels detected in the canyon flanks are about two to three orders of magnitude lower than those found in the coastal area. Nevertheless, when quantifiable. TBT levels in the canyon samples were higher than the Environmental Assessment Criteria set for TBT in sediments by the OSPAR Commission indicating that at those locations negative ecological impacts are likely to occur.

40|$|Organotin (OT) {{compounds}} {{have been}} used as biocide agents in antifouling paints since the mid 1960 s and are now ubiquitous in the marine environment. Due to their high toxicity to non-target species they were banned from antifouling paints in the European Union in 2003 (2002 / 62 /EC directive). The aim of the present work is to assess any obvious decline of the OT environmental levels at Ria de Aveiro (NW Portugal) after the ban. The organotins – monobutyltin (MBT), dibutyltin (DBT), tributyltin (TBT), monophenyltin (MPT), diphenyltin (DPT), triphenyltin (TPT), monoctyltin (MOT), <b>dioctyltin</b> (<b>DOT)</b> and trioctyltin (TOT) – were quantified in the gastropod Nassarius reticulatus, in the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis and in sediments. Imposex (imposition of male characters on females of gonochorist gastropods) in N. reticulatus was additionally used as a biomarker of TBT pollution. Time comparisons show a slight decrease of imposex between 2003 and 2005 probably {{as a consequence of the}} EU ban, though in some cases this trend seems to have started earlier since 2000. The fraction of TBT relatively to its metabolites has been decreasing over the last years but still remains high suggesting that there are still recent inputs of this compound into the study area...|$|R
40|$|Concentrations of tin were {{measured}} in six different brands of disposable baby diapers by using radioisotope (americium) excited energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence. Top sheet and adhesive tape system {{were measured}} separately. The concentrations found in top sheet and tape system were < 1. 5 to 23. 1 mg/kg and < 1. 5 to 22. 4 mg/kg, respectively. Almost all diapers contained tin in the adhesive tape system (four of five) {{and two of}} six samples contained tin in top sheet. Tin found in diapers may be an organotin substance: tributyltin (TBT), dibutyltin (DBT), monobutyltin (MBT) and/or <b>dioctyltin</b> (<b>DOT),</b> which are widely used in industrial processes as catalysts or as PVC heat stabilizers. Organotin substances have toxic effects which include neurotoxicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, immunotoxicity, and endocrine disruption. The measured concentrations were less than EU regulatory levels of 0. 1 % by weight of tin prescribed by REACH Annex XVII No 20. However, the same regulation completely bans the use of organotin substances as biocides in antifouling paints. While effects of TBT on marine organisms from antifouling paints are well known, the effects of organotin compounds in childcare products and other commercial articles receive much less attention.

40|$|Organotin {{compounds}} (butyl-, phenyl-, octyl- and tributylmonomethyltin) and {{inorganic tin}} were quantified in sea-water and sediments from two harbours and several locations on the southeast coast of India using highly sensitive and selective gas chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (GC-ICP-MS), adopting new extraction and analytical techniques with extremely low detection limits (water, 0. 019 – 0. 85 pg l 21; sediment, 0. 23 – 0. 48 ng g 21). The concentrations of monobutyltin (MBT), dibutyltin (DBT) and tributyltin (TBT) in sea-water from Tuticorin harbour varied from 0. 64 to 4. 97, 3. 0 to 26. 8 and 0. 3 to 30. 4 ng Sn l 21, respectively. MBT, DBT and TBT in sediments from harbour areas ranged from 1. 6 to 393, 1. 3 to 394 and ND (not detected) to 1280 ng Sn g 21 (dry weight), respectively. Natural methylation in both harbours {{was established by}} quantifying tributylmonomethyltin (TBMMT) residues (sea-water, ND– 0. 19 ng Sn l 21; sediment, ND– 765 ng Sn g 21 dry weight). In sea-water, octyltins were also determined as monooctyltin (MOT) w <b>dioctyltin</b> (<b>DOT)</b> w trioctyltin (TOT). Butyltin contamination in commercial harbours is evident, but other coastal waters are not contaminated with organotin residues. The high concentration of inorganic tin in estuarine sediment indicates an elevated rate of debutylation in the estuarine environment. Both methylation and debutylation of TBT in Chennai harbour were greater than in Tuticorin harbour. A significant correlation (r 2 ~ 0. 75) between total butyltin and organic carbon contents in sediment was found.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Boron and boron {{compounds}} {{have been}} long used for pressure treatment, dip-diffusion, and remedial treatments of wood {{because of their}} proven efficacy against fungi and insects. These materials are especially attractive because their high water solubility promotes deeper penetration into wood. Other useful properties of boron include its neutral pH, non-corrosiveness, lack of color or odor, and little or no effect on wood strength. Boron also has low-mammalian toxicity and minimal environmental effects. However, high water solubility limits outdoor applications because the boron will leach from the wood when it is exposed to rain or is in direct soil contact. Boron is widely used as a component in external remedial pastes, primarily as disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (<b>DOT).</b> This boron <b>compound</b> has higher water solubility and only remains in wood 3 to 7 years after application.

For the molecular dynamics simulations, we used an A beta(42) pentameric model where the compounds were docked using a blind docking technique. To analyze the dynamic behaviour of the complexes, extensive molecular dynamics simulations were carried out in explicit water. We also measured parameters or descriptors that allowed us to quantify {{the effect of these}} compounds as potential inhibitors of A beta aggregation. Thus, significant alterations in the structure of our A beta(42) protofibril model were identified. Among others we observed the destruction of the regular helical twist, the loss of a stabilizing salt bridge and the loss of a stabilizing hydrophobic interaction in the beta 1 region. Our results may be helpful in the structural identification and understanding of the minimum structural requirements for these molecules and might provide a guide in the design of new aggregation modulating ligands.

So a quintuplet (quintolet or pentuplet [...] ) indicated with the numeral 5 means that five of the indicated note value total the duration normally occupied by four (or, as a division of a <b>dotted</b> note in <b>compound</b> time, three), equivalent to the second higher note value; for example, five quintuplet eighth notes total the same duration as a half note (or, in [...] or compound meters such as , , etc. time, a dotted quarter note). Some numbers are used inconsistently: for example septuplets (septolets or septimoles) usually indicate 7 notes in the duration of 4—or in compound meter 7 for 6—but may sometimes be used to mean 7 notes in the duration of 8 (Read 1964, 183-84).

However, association patterns of weak {{hydrogen bonds}} are generally difficult to characterize, and yet the identification of such patterns is of interest, especially in high throughput work or where single crystal X-ray analysis is difficult or impossible. To obtain structural information on such assemblies, we describe here a five step IR spectroscopic method that identifies supramolecular synthons in weak hydrogen bonded dimer assemblies, bifurcated systems, and p-electron mediated synthons. The synthons studied here contain C-H groups as hydrogen bond donors. The method involves: (i) identifying simple compounds/cocrystals/salts that contain the hydrogen bonded dimer synthon of interest or linear hydrogen bonded assemblies between the same functionalities; (ii) scanning infrared (IR) spectra of the compounds; (iii) identifying characteristic spectral differences between dimer and linear; (iv) assigning identified bands as marker bands for identification of the supramolecular synthon, and finally (v) identifying synthons in compounds whose crystal structures are not known.

The findings were applied to the for. mulation of the'steroid prednisolone, in an attempt to produce elevated more uniform plasma drug levels by enhancing lymphatic absorption. The rank order for total DOT absorption from 1 m! Volumes of different vehicles was arachis oil > Miglyol 812 = water containing 6 % Tween 80 > liquid paraffin. The concentration of DDT in lymph collected via thoracic duct cannblae in anaesthetised rats was greatest in the presence of arachis oil, there being no difference between Miglyol 812 and liquid paraffin. Using a gamma camera the gastric emptying rate and total intestinal transit of 9 ~c-sulphur colloid, an oil phase marker, was shown to be faster in the presence of 1 ml liquid paraffin than the other two oils. The oral absorption of 3 H-prednisolone was independent of the nature of the oily vehicle (30 pl volumes) and was not selectively absorbed into the lymph. Esterification to 3 H-prednisolone- 21 -palmitate increased the lipophilicity of the drug but did not stimulate selective lymphatic absorption and reduced oral absorption following administration in arachis oil. Lymphatic absorption of the ester was not promoted by administration in 1 ml arachis oil. Only the lymphatic absorption of compounds exhibiting selective uptake into the lymph may be enhanced by the presence of a suitable lipid vehicle. Altered gastro-intestinal motility in the presence of lipids may have greater potential for enhancing the absorption of a wider variety of compounds...|$|R

Through synergistic combination of computational modeling and experimental studies, the thesis addresses the thermodynamics and kinetics that are relevant during synthesis and processing and their resulting impact on the properties of silicon thin films and ternary quantum <b>dots</b> (TQDs) of <b>compound</b> semiconductors. ^ The thesis presents a computational study of the growth mechanisms of plasma deposited a-Si:H thin films based on kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations according to a transition probability database constructed by first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Based on the results, a comprehensive model is proposed for a-Si:H thin-film growth by plasma deposition under conditions that make the silyl (SiH 3) radical the dominant deposition precursor. It is found that the relative roles of surface coordination defects are crucial in determining the surface composition of plasma deposited a-Si:H films and should be properly accounted for. The KMC predictions for the temperature dependence (over the range from 300 K to 700 K) of the surface concentration of SiHx(s) (x = 1, 2, 3) surface hydride species, the surface hydrogen content, and the surface dangling-bond coverage are in agreement with experimental measurements. ^ In addition, the thesis details a systematic analysis of equilibrium compositional distribution in TQDs and their effects on the electronic and optoelectronic properties. Formation of hetero-nanostructures, such as core/shell-like structures, through atomic-scale assembly driven by equilibrium surface segregation is studied {{as a function of}} nanocrystal size, composition, and temperatures for TQD morphologies that include faceted equilibrium nanocrystal shapes for ZnSe 1 -xTex and InxGa 1 -xAs TQDs; the results are based on coupled compositional, structural, and volume relaxation of the nanocrystals according to Monte Carlo and conjugate-gradient methods employing a DFT-parameterized description of interatomic interactions. A phenomenological species transport theory also is developed that explains the concentration profiles due to surface-segregation-induced ordering of constituent and dopant atoms in the dilute limit. The nm-scale diffusion lengths in nanocrystals introduce an interesting interplay between the kinetic and thermodynamic stability of interfaces. The thermodynamic stability of such interfaces in ZnSe 1 -xSx TQDs are investigated based on DFT calculations combined with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of TQDs that are synthesized and annealed using colloidal methods. The results demonstrate the possibility of compositional redistribution that causes degradation over time of core/shell TQD electronic properties, with far reaching implications for the use of such nanostructures in devices. Electronic structure calculations of ZnSe 1 -xSx (type-I) and ZnSe 1 -xTe x (type-II) TQDs elucidate the impact of composition and compositional distribution on the electron density distribution, density of states, and band gap of the TQDs. The resulting relationships with respect to the distributions in the TQDs of constituent/dopant/impurity atoms (core/shell vs. alloyed TQDs) provide an interpretation for the key features observed in the PL spectra, as well as useful guidelines for improving the design and device performance of TQDs. ...|$|R
