5|$|After Cimon's ostracism, Pericles {{continued}} {{to promote a}} populist social policy. He first proposed a decree that permitted the poor to watch theatrical plays without paying, with the state covering {{the cost of their}} admission. With other decrees <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> property requirement for the archonship in 458–457 BC and bestowed generous wages on all citizens who served as jurymen in the Heliaia (the supreme court of Athens) some time just after 454BC. His most controversial measure, however, was a law of 451 BC limiting Athenian citizenship to those of Athenian parentage on both sides.|$|E
25|$|On October 27 {{while still}} in Memphis, he set two world records within 45 minutes of each other. In the first, <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> record for the half mile from 57 seconds to 56 seconds flat. In the second, he lowered his own record for a mile pacing to wagon from 1:59 to 1:57.|$|E
25|$|Brown’s {{reaction}} to the great 2008 banking crisis was much more pro active than France or Germany, {{and in many ways}} resembled the Bush policies in Washington. Brown's goals were to provide more liquidity to the financial system, to recapitalise the banks and to guarantee bank debt. <b>He</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> VAT to encourage consumer spending and to keep the economy from sinking.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Scalper succumbs to {{the train}} of thought {{suggested}} and gives an illustration of how moderation to excess may be avoided, after which <b>he</b> <b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> bottle to Policeman Hogan with a cheery exchange of greetings.|$|R

50|$|In Viva Cuba, a road movie fairy tale, Cremata tackles {{localized}} Cuban {{problems from}} the literal {{point of view}} of <b>the</b> country’s children. <b>He</b> <b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> camera to the eye level of the film’s protagonists, Malú (Malú Tarrau Broche) and Jorgito (Jorgito Miló Ávila).|$|R
25|$|First Officer David Kelly, who {{was flying}} the USAir 1493 during the {{accident}} leg, {{reported that he}} did not see SkyWest 5569 until <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> nose of his aircraft onto the runway after landing. Kelly also said that he applied the brakes, but did not have enough time for evasive action. Statements made by passengers who survived the crash were consistent with this testimony.|$|E
25|$|In February 1841, Talbot {{obtained}} an English {{patent for}} his developed-out calotype process. At first, he sold individual patent licences for £20 each; later, <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> fee for amateur use to £4. Professional photographers, however, {{had to pay}} up to £300 annually. In a business climate where many patent holders were attacked for enforcing their rights, and an academic world that viewed the patenting of new discoveries as a crass hindrance to scientific freedom and further progress, Talbot's behaviour was widely criticised. One reason Talbot later gave for vigorously enforcing his rights {{was that he had}} spent, according to his own reckoning, about £5,000 on his various photographic endeavours over the years and wanted to at least recoup his expenses.|$|E
500|$|St Stephen's Chapel {{remained}} largely unchanged until 1692 when Sir Christopher Wren, {{at the time}} the Master of the King's Works, was instructed to make structural alterations. <b>He</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> roof, removed the stained glass windows, put in a new floor and covered the original gothic architecture with wood panelling. He also added galleries from which the public could watch proceedings. The result was described by one visitor to the chamber as [...] "dark, gloomy, and badly ventilated, and so small... when an important debate occurred... the members were really to be pitied". When the future Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone remembered his arrival as a new MP in 1832, he recounted [...] "What I may term corporeal conveniences were... marvellously small. I do not think that in any part of the building it afforded the means of so much as washing the hands." [...] The facilities were so poor that, in debates in 1831 and 1834, Joseph Hume, a Radical MP, called for new accommodation for the House, while his fellow MP William Cobbett asked [...] "Why are we squeezed into so small a space that it is absolutely impossible that there should be calm and regular discussion, even from circumstance alone... Why are 658 of us crammed into a space that allows each of us no more than {{a foot and a half}} square?" ...|$|E
5000|$|In The Muppet Movie, while Kermit and Fozzie are driving. Kermit {{looks at}} the map and says they need to turn at the fork in the road. At this point <b>he</b> <b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> map and they see a giant fork (the cutlery) {{in the middle of}} the road.|$|R
50|$|His {{hatred for}} his mother began when he {{purchased}} Thredson's taped confession to her online, and Thredson begging Lana not to abort the pregnancy. He puts a gun to her head, but she convinces him {{that he is not}} a killer like his father. As <b>he</b> <b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> gun and starts sobbing, Lana takes the gun from him and shoots him in the head, killing him.|$|R

2500|$|It was a {{high wing}} aircraft; the wing had {{constant}} chord out to rounded tips and had a wooden structure with plywood skinning. The Villiers XXIV {{had been the first}} French aircraft maker to use Handley Page slats and the Villiers 26 reconnaissance seaplane used a combination of automatically opening slats on the leading edge in front of the ailerons and another set which the pilot opened as <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> flaps. [...] The Type 31 had a similar combination of automatic and commanded slats.|$|E
2500|$|Dan Patch {{made two}} further {{appearances}} in 1903. At Birmingham, Alabama on November 10, <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> {{record for a}} mile on a half mile track to 2:03, even though his pacemaker had plunged wildly ahead. The conditions in Macon, Georgia on November 30 were cold and windy but Dan Patch still set two world records {{within an hour of}} each other. In the first, he was attached to an old-fashioned high-wheeled sulky and lowered the existing record by [...] seconds. In the second, he paced two miles in 4:17, lowering the existing record by two seconds.|$|E
2500|$|Scottish chemist and {{physicist}} James Dewar and the Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes took on {{the challenge}} to liquefy the remaining gases hydrogen and helium. In 1898, after 20 years of effort, Dewar was first to liquefy hydrogen, reaching a new low temperature record of [...] However Onnes, his rival, {{was the first to}} liquefy helium, in 1908, using several precooling stages and the Hampson–Linde cycle. <b>He</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> temperature to the boiling point of helium [...] By reducing the pressure of the liquid helium he achieved an even lower temperature, near 1.5 K. These were the coldest temperatures achieved on earth at the time and his achievement earned him the Nobel Prize in 1913. Onnes would continue to study the properties of materials at temperatures near absolute zero, describing superconductivity and superfluids for the first time.|$|E

2500|$|Rowland Hill {{continued}} at the Post Office until the Conservative Party won the 1841 General Election. Sir Robert Peel returned to office on 30 August 1841 and served until 29 June 1846. Amid rancorous controversy, Hill was dismissed in July 1842. However, the London and Brighton Railway named him a director and later {{chairman of the}} board, from 1843 to 1846. <b>He</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> fares from London to Brighton, expanded the routes, offered special excursion trains, and made the commute comfortable for passengers. In 1844 Edwin Chadwick, Rowland Hill, John Stuart Mill, Lyon Playfair, Dr. Neill Arnott, and other friends formed a society called [...] "Friends in Council," [...] which met at each other's houses to discuss questions of political economy. Hill also {{became a member of}} the influential Political Economy Club, founded by David Ricardo and other classical economists, but now including many powerful businessmen and political figures.|$|E
2500|$|The contests, too, were an illusion. Útgarða-Loki {{reveals that}} Loki had {{actually}} competed against wildfire itself (Logi, Old Norse [...] "flame"), Þjálfi had raced against thought (Hugi, Old Norse [...] "thought"), Thor's drinking horn had actually reached {{to the ocean}} and with his drinks <b>he</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> ocean level (resulting in tides). The cat that Thor attempted to lift was in actuality the world serpent, Jörmungandr, and everyone was terrified when Thor was able to lift the paw of this [...] "cat", for Thor had actually held the great serpent up to the sky. The old woman Thor wrestled was in fact old age (Elli, Old Norse [...] "old age"), {{and there is no}} one that old age cannot bring down. Útgarða-Loki tells Thor {{that it would be better}} for [...] "both sides" [...] if they did not meet again. Upon hearing this, Thor takes hold of his hammer and swings it at Útgarða-Loki but he is gone and so is his castle. Only a wide landscape remains.|$|E
2500|$|Eddie {{reported}} {{that he intended to}} fly to the Pacific coast and back on July 30, 1930. On August 25, 1930 he set the round-trip transcontinental air speed record for pilots under the age of twenty-one years in his Cessna using a Warner Scarab engine. The trip was sponsored by Richfield Oil. He flew from Westfield, New Jersey on August 14, 1930 to Los Angeles, California in 4days with a combined flying time of 29 hours and 55 minutes. <b>He</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> East to West record by 4 hours and 22 minutes. He then made the return trip from Los Angeles to Roosevelt Airfield in New York in 27 hours and 19 minutes, lowering the West to East record by 1hour and 36 minutes. His total elapsed time for the round trip was 57 hours and 14 minutes, breaking the preceding record for the round trip. Frank Herbert Goldsborough held the previous record which was 62 hours and 58 minutes. When Eddie landed in New York on August 25, 1930, his first words were to his father: [...] "Hello Pop, I made it." [...] He was carrying letters from the Mayor John Clinton Porter of Los Angeles, to Mayor Frank Hague of Jersey City. Combined he set three records.|$|E
50|$|Conversely, if {{the amount}} {{proposed}} for sale is higher, <b>he</b> must <b>lower</b> <b>the</b> price. This {{will have the}} exact opposite effects from above, {{increasing the number of}} proposed purchases and decreasing the number of proposed sales.|$|R
5000|$|... 18. Leslie: Leslie can't {{figure out}} what to do with her toes since she thinks they're useless. She tries to sell them to Louis for 5¢ each (a total of 50¢), but then <b>he</b> <b>lowers</b> <b>the</b> offer price on her three {{smallest}} toes (on each foot) to 3¢ each (a total of 38¢). When Leslie won't sell the small toes at that price, Louis offers her 10¢ total for the two big ones; she refuses to sell her toes unless as a complete set, thus losing the deal.|$|R
60|$|Isaac's {{hand was}} still extended. This time <b>he</b> had <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> muzzle of his pistol. The {{inspector}} was only human and he paused, {{for he was}} looking straight {{into the mouth of}} it. Isaac slowly backed toward the door.|$|R
2500|$|The {{church was}} listed as Grade II*, number 1149449, on 18 July 1949 {{on the grounds that}} the tower and chancel {{constitute}} a medieval element of the dressed and coursed sandstone structure. It has graded-slate roofs. The chancel is lower and narrower than the nave, and was built in the 14thcentury, the east window tracery dates from 1350. Parts of the chancel may be remnants of the earlier 13th-century stone church. The tower was added at the west end in the 15th or 16thcentury. During the ministry of William Raper and after becoming derelict, the nave was rebuilt in 1772 with Georgian elements in the churchwarden style, including [...] "rounded Georgian windows with amber glass, a plaster ceiling with a decorated cornice, box pews and a three-decker pulpit (all now gone). It was restored during the ministry of Mark Rowntree in 1882 to 1884 while the church was closed. He replaced the box pews with pitch pine ones and removed the three-decker pulpit. <b>He</b> <b>lowered</b> <b>the</b> nave floor by [...] and raised the chancel floor and ceiling to create the Bentley's burial crypt below. It was probably at this time that the present arch braced truss ceiling was installed. Before Rowntree's work, the nave floor was higher than those of the tower and chancel. The same section was remodelled again in 1929 when the ceiling and some oak roof beams were replaced, and electric light installed. In 1930 perpendicular windows replaced the Georgian ones. In 1934 the church acquired an organ loft in the tower arch and the ground floor of the tower became a vestry. On the south side a porch and choir vestry were added in 1952, the glazed and polygonal chapter house was built in 1977 and the parish meeting rooms and kitchen in 1988 or 1999.|$|E
