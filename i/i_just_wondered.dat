5000|$|Writing in Patheos, author Samya {{notes that}} {{there is a lack of}} balance [...] "when certain {{concepts}} are discussed", and that [...] "they tend to lack balance in their presentation...the film talks about female genital mutilation, a practice that is neither advocated in Islam nor appears in Quran, but has been adopted by some Muslim societies, as mentioned in the film by Qanta Ahmed...the film presents a Muslim preacher, Sheikh Yussuf Al Badri, from Al Azhar Islamic University in Cairo, saying: “circumcision is the reason why Muslim women are virtuous, unlike Western women who run after their sexual appetite in any place with any man.” When considering this example, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wonder</b> why filmmakers have chosen to play up the views of this scholar rather than the anti-circumcision views advocated by the film...For me, it gives the impression that “Islam” supports such actions, rather than acknowledging the many Muslim communities and individuals that don’t practice it or that advocate against it." ...|$|R
