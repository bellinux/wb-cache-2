2500|$|Rhino hired Terry Gilliam and {{was granted}} an {{extension}} from Thompson {{but only with}} the stipulation that the director made the film. Rhino {{did not want to}} commit to Gilliam in case he didn't work out. Thompson remembers, [...] "They just kept asking for more [...] I <b>got</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> agitated about it, because I thought they were trying to put off doing it. So I began to charge them more... I wanted to see the movie done, once it got started." [...] The studio threatened to make the film with Cox and without Depp and del Toro. The two actors were upset when producer Laila Nabulsi told them of Rhino's plans. Universal Pictures stepped in to distribute the film and Depp and Gilliam were paid $500,000 each but the director still did not have a firm deal in place. In retaliation, Depp and Gilliam locked Rhino out of the set during filming.|$|E
