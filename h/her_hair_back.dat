5|$|The video {{begins on}} a city {{sidewalk}} where Scherzinger walks into a telephone booth as several men in black suits pass by the booth. As Scherzinger begins to undress, the men stop to stare as she begins taking off her glasses and shaking <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>back.</b> The video then moves to Scherzinger in a dress walking past four men mopping the floor to a supply closet where she enters and reappears moments later, {{dressed in a black}} body suit with a cape. As the chorus begins, the situation rapidly switches back-and-forth from Scherzinger in her good-girl persona shown fighting escaped jail prisoners dressed in striped suits (and Beagle Boys masks) to Scherzinger in her bad-girl persona fighting with police. As the song progresses, Scherzinger is shown in a classic looking automobile and riding a BMW motorcycle, with a streaking white and black background. Several shots of her bad-girl persona alone in a room with two prisoners are then shown. As the bridge begins, she is shown in her good-girl ego standing by a podium, talking to a group of reporters while waving her hands in the air. As the bridge ends, she brings her hands down, blowing back all of the reporters, who then begin dancing and pumping their arms to the song. The video moves to Scherzinger dancing with the police and prisoners before ending with her blowing away the two men who were in the room with her and walking away.|$|E

A teaser for the video surfaced and was quickly removed online in October 2010, to later appear again in early 2011. In the video, Lopez acts as a beauty school teacher. Whipping <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> and forth, she instructs a classroom of students on [...] "Fierceology" [...] and [...] "Work It Out 101". These scenes are, in an alternative video, intercut with behind the scenes footage from the Love? photoshoot. The clip was noted for its sex appeal, in which Lopez and her students were dressed in Dolce & Gabbana.|$|E

[...] "I don't feel like me unless I have my hair shaved. So even when I'm an old lady, I'm going to have it." ...|$|E

Weatherly improvised during the audition by brushing <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> and commenting, [...] "You remind me of Salma Hayek." [...] De Pablo, who was initially upset by the departure from the script, stayed in character and [...] "dismissed him completely". She later said in an interview, [...] "He totally did it with the other [...] One other girl sort of flirted back with him, and she was sort of open. Which is what actors do! They're sort of open. But I got lucky and got the part because I responded the way they felt was right." ...|$|E
2500|$|By this point, however, Empress Wang {{was facing}} a major threat from another romantic rival. [...] When Emperor Gaozong was crown prince, he {{had an affair with}} one of Emperor Taizong's concubines, Consort Wu. [...] After Emperor Taizong's death, all of his concubines who did not bear sons, which {{included}} Wu, were housed at Ganye Temple (感業寺) to be Buddhist nuns. [...] In either 650 or 651, Emperor Gaozong was visiting Ganye Temple to offer incense to Buddha when he saw Consort Wu. [...] Both of them wept. [...] When Empress Wang heard this, she, wanting to divert Emperor Gaozong's favor from Consort Xiao, secretly instructed Consort Wu to grow <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>back,</b> while suggesting to Emperor Gaozong that he take her as a concubine. [...] Consort Wu was intelligent and full of machinations, and therefore, when she first returned to the palace, she acted humbly and flattered Empress Wang, who trusted her greatly and recommended her to Emperor Gaozong. [...] Soon, Emperor Gaozong became enamored with Consort Wu.|$|E

2500|$|According to the EastEnders Handbook by Hilary Kingsley, casting babies for {{roles in}} EastEnders is usually done locally, so that {{children}} and their parents do not have to travel far when they are called into the studios at BBC Elstree. Because of the strict laws dictating the number of hours babies are permitted to work, occasionally dolls or understudies have to be used if the child runs out of time. This occurred with Steven’s original actor, Edward Farrell, in 1990. The baby had been scripted to appear at a Guy Fawkes Night party; however, actress Michelle Collins, who played his screen mother Cindy, has since revealed that they used another baby for those scenes: [...] "Not only was she a girl, she also had bright red hair whereas Edward was fair. I had to keep pushing <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> under her hat but lots of [...] still spotted it". Young Farrell was also the reason viewers never saw Cindy wearing her red wedding dress on-screen again following its next outing at Steven’s christening in February 1990. It was a dress that Michelle Collins particularly disliked. She has commented, [...] "When Edward was sick over it, I knew it wouldn’t recover and I kissed him for it." ...|$|E

2500|$|A Phoenix toy {{was created}} {{based on the}} first X-Men movie. Three {{different}} variants were released. The first had her with an open top, no bra, and <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> down.

60|$|It had all {{happened}} so suddenly that no one--least of all Licinia--could guess {{what it was}} that had so angered my lady.

60|$|But she {{was here}} {{with him in the}} car, close to him, and the wind was rushing on her lifted, eager face, blowing <b>back</b> the <b>hair.</b> He turned and looked at her, at her face clean as a chiselled thing, <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> chiselled <b>back</b> by the wind, her fine nose keen and lifted.|$|R

60|$|Then Mr. Rusper married, and {{he married}} very inconsiderately {{a woman who}} was totally uninteresting to Mr. Polly. A coolness grew between them from the first intimation of her advent. Mr. Polly couldn't help {{thinking}} when he saw her that she drew <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> from her forehead a great deal too tightly, and that her elbows were angular. His desire not to mention these things in the apt terms that welled up so richly in his mind, made him awkward in her presence, and that gave her an impression that he was hiding some guilty secret from her. She decided he must have a bad influence upon her husband, and she {{made it a point to}} appear whenever she heard him talking to Rusper.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know that}} I was ever {{introduced}} to him," [...] continued Mr. Maule, [...] "and I shall always regret it. I was telling Madame Goesler how profound a reverence I {{had for the}} Duke's character." [...] Phineas bowed, and Madame Goesler, who was becoming tired of the Duke as a subject of conversation, asked some question as to what {{had been going on}} in the House. Mr. Maule, finding it to be improbable that {{he should be able to}} advance his cause on that occasion, took his leave. The moment he was gone Madame Goesler's manner changed altogether. She left her former seat and came near to Phineas, sitting on a sofa close to the chair he occupied; and as she did so she pushed <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> from her face in a manner that he remembered well in former days.|$|E

Or shall I defy Sydney and lead a life of dread? If he menaced my life, I should not fear; but he menaces that which is dearer than life--my good name. A look, a word can tarnish it; a scornful smile, a {{significant}} shrug can do me more harm than any blow; for I am a woman--friendless, poor, and at the mercy of his tongue.

6000|$|Before this remonstrance was finished, Maggie {{was already}} out of hearing, making her way toward the great attic that run under the old high-pitched roof, shaking the water from her black locks as she ran, like a Skye terrier escaped from his bath. This attic was Maggie's {{favorite}} retreat on a wet day, when the weather was not too cold; here she fretted out all her ill humors, and talked aloud to the worm-eaten floors and the worm-eaten shelves, and the dark rafters festooned with cobwebs; and here she kept a Fetish which she punished for all her misfortunes. This was {{the trunk of a}} large wooden doll, which once stared with the roundest of eyes above the reddest of cheeks; but was now entirely defaced by a long career of vicarious suffering. Three nails driven into the head commemorated as many crises in Maggie's nine years of earthly struggle; that luxury of vengeance having been suggested to her by the picture of Jael destroying Sisera in the old Bible. The last nail had been driven in with a fiercer stroke than usual, for the Fetish on that occasion represented aunt Glegg. But immediately afterward Maggie had reflected that if she drove many nails in she would not be so well able to fancy that the head was hurt when she knocked it against the wall, nor to comfort it, and make believe to poultice it, when her fury was abated; for even aunt Glegg would be pitiable when she had been hurt very much, and thoroughly humiliated, so as to beg her niece's pardon. Since then she had driven no more nails in, but had soothed herself by alternately grinding and beating the wooden head against the rough brick of the great chimneys that made two square pillars supporting the roof. That was what she did this morning on reaching the attic, sobbing all the while with a passion that expelled every other form of consciousness,--even the memory of the grievance that had caused it. As at last the sobs were getting quieter, and the grinding less fierce, a sudden beam of sunshine, falling through the wire lattice across the worm-eaten shelves, made her throw away the Fetish and run to the window. The sun was really breaking out; the sound of the mill seemed cheerful again; the granary doors were open; and there was Yap, the queer white-and-brown terrier, with one ear turned back, trotting about and sniffing vaguely, as if he were in search of a companion. It was irresistible. Maggie tossed <b>her</b> <b>hair</b> <b>back</b> and ran downstairs, seized her bonnet without putting it on, peeped, and then dashed along the passage lest she should encounter her mother, and was quickly out in the yard, whirling round like a Pythoness, and singing as she whirled, [...] "Yap, Yap, Tom's coming home!" [...] while Yap danced and barked round her, as much as to say, if there was any noise wanted he was the dog for it.|$|E
