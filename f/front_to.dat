5|$|The ARVN III Corps commander, General Toan, {{organized}} five {{centers of}} resistance {{for the defense}} of the city. These fronts were so connected as to form an arc enveloping the area west, north, and east of the capital. The Cu Chi <b>front,</b> <b>to</b> the northwest, was defended by the 25th Division; the Bình Dương <b>front,</b> <b>to</b> the north, was the responsibility of the 5th Division; the Biên Hòa <b>front,</b> <b>to</b> the northeast, was defended by the 18th Division; the Vũng Tàu and 15 Route <b>front,</b> <b>to</b> the southeast, was held by the 1st Airborne Brigade and one battalion of the 3rd Division; and the Long An front, for which the Capital Military District Command was responsible, was defended by elements of the re-formed 22nd Division. South Vietnamese defensive forces around Saigon totaled approximately 60,000 troops. However, as the exodus made its way into Saigon, along with them were many ARVN soldiers, causing the number of men under arms in the city to exceed 250,000. Unfortunately, these units were mostly battered and leaderless, which threw the city into further anarchy.|$|E
5|$|During the High Middle Ages, the {{majority}} of Poland's castles were still made of wood, so uncut stone was frequently added to the <b>front</b> <b>to</b> improve their fire defences.|$|E
50|$|Half-blind {{dovetails}} {{are commonly}} used <b>to</b> fasten drawer <b>fronts</b> <b>to</b> drawer sides. This is {{an alternative to the}} practice of attaching false <b>fronts</b> <b>to</b> drawers constructed using through dovetails.|$|R

5|$|Hurricane Audrey {{directed}} moisture up to a <b>front</b> <b>to</b> {{its north}} across the Midwest during late June 1957 as it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Heavy rains fell across central Illinois, {{leading to the}} wettest known event {{to be associated with}} a tropical cyclone or its remains across Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Independent slinger {{units are}} not attested in the epigraphic {{record of the}} Principate. However, slingers are portrayed on Trajan's Column. They are shown unarmoured, wearing a short tunic. They carry a cloth bag, slung in <b>front,</b> <b>to</b> hold their shot (glandes).|$|E
5|$|On Bermuda, the {{combination}} of the storm and a cold <b>front</b> <b>to</b> its north produced 2.19inches (55.6mm) of rainfall in the first two days of October, which was about half of the monthly rainfall total.|$|E

5|$|The single known molar is high-crowned (hypsodont) and flat-crowned (planar) and is {{distinctive}} in {{lacking the}} ridge {{that connects the}} <b>front</b> <b>to</b> the middle part of the molar, the anterior mure, and in the configuration of another ridge, the mesoloph. Carletonomys was probably herbivorous and lived in a wet habitat.|$|E
5|$|A {{modified}} version of the standard MP 40 (sometimes erroneously called MP 40/II) with a dual side-by-side magazine holder (for a theoretical ammunition total of 64 rounds), designed for special operations troops on the Eastern <b>Front</b> <b>to</b> compensate for the enemies' PPSh-41 larger magazine capacity. However, the design proved unsuccessful due to weight and reliability issues.|$|E
5|$|A regimental {{group of}} the 7th SS Division was to advance west from the area of Mrkonjić Grad, break through Partisan {{resistance}} east of the Sana and then advance on a wide <b>front</b> <b>to</b> block escape routes east out of Drvar. Part of this group was to advance from Jajce along the rail line and roads through Savici to reach their objective, the area around Mliniste power station.|$|E

5|$|A second {{competing}} {{theory for}} extratropical cyclone development over the oceans is the Shapiro-Keyser model, developed in 1990. Its main {{differences with the}} Norwegian Cyclone Model are the fracture of the cold front, treating warm-type occlusions and warm fronts as the same, and allowing the cold <b>front</b> <b>to</b> progress through the warm sector perpendicular to the warm front. This model was based on oceanic cyclones and their frontal structure, as seen in surface observations and in previous projects which used aircraft to determine the vertical structure of fronts across the northwest Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|A second {{method of}} rear delay array {{combines}} end-fire topology with polarity reversal, using two subwoofers positioned <b>front</b> <b>to</b> back, the drivers spaced one-quarter wavelength apart, the rear enclosure inverted in polarity and delayed {{by a few}} milliseconds for maximum cancellation on stage of the target frequency. This method has the least output power directed toward the audience, compared to other directional methods.|$|E
5|$|A single tooth, MACN Pv-RN 248, is {{currently}} {{identified as a}} Ferugliotherium upper molariform. In 1992, Krause and colleagues labeled it as a right MF1, but Gurovich identifies it as a left MF1 or possibly even a right mf1. LACM 149371, an enigmatic tooth from the Paleogene of Santa Rosa, Peru, may represent an upper molar of an animal related to Ferugliotherium. Like the latter, it has cusps that are compressed from <b>front</b> <b>to</b> back and that {{are connected to the}} center of the crown by low crests.|$|E

5|$|According to Ian Smith's memoirs, Van der Byl {{organised}} {{a meeting}} between Ian Smith and Lieutenant-General Peter Walls, Commander of the Rhodesian Army, shortly before the first Zimbabwean elections in February 1980, where they agreed a strategy to prevent Robert Mugabe winning. They met again on 26 February the day before polling began in the Common Roll election. The consensus at this meeting was that Abel Muzorewa's interim government would win enough seats, when put together with the 20 seats reserved for whites which were all Rhodesian <b>Front,</b> <b>to</b> deny Mugabe victory. However, the early election results in March dented this confidence.|$|E
5|$|After 1728, Hylton's second son, John Hylton, de jure 18th Baron Hylton added a {{complementary}} south wing (its foundation wall still extant), crenellations to both wings {{and removed the}} door on the north wing. He also changed the circular bartizan on {{the north end of the}} west <b>front,</b> <b>to</b> an octagonal turret and removed the portcullis from the west entrance.|$|E
5|$|After the Attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the Screen Writers Guild {{set up on}} December 8, 1941, the Hollywood Writers Mobilization, a body to {{organize}} writers for the war effort. Rossen served as the body's chairman until 1944 and advocated {{the opening of a}} Second <b>Front</b> <b>to</b> support West European resistance against the Nazis. His earnings were much greater than in 1937. However, his work for Hollywood Writers Mobilization and for the Communist Party forced him to abandon some partly developed film projects, including The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, which John Huston eventually directed in 1948.|$|E

5|$|After {{the battle}} of Stalingrad in February 1943, Himmler {{realised}} that Germany would likely lose the war, and ordered the formation of Sonderkommando 1005, a special task force under SS-Standartenführer Paul Blobel. The unit's assignment was to visit mass graves on the Eastern <b>Front</b> <b>to</b> exhume bodies and burn them {{in an attempt to}} cover up the genocide. The task remained unfinished {{at the end of the}} war, and many mass graves remain unmarked and unexcavated.|$|E
5|$|After {{three days}} of intense fighting, the corps-sized 1st Polish Army under General Franciszek Latinik managed to repel a direct assault by six Red Army rifle {{divisions}} at Radzymin and Ossów. The struggle for control of Radzymin forced General Józef Haller, commander of the Polish Northern <b>Front,</b> <b>to</b> start the 5th Army's counterattack earlier than planned. Radzymin was recaptured on August 15, and this victory proved {{to be one of}} the turning points of the battle of Warsaw. The strategic counteroffensive was successful, pushing Soviet forces away from Radzymin and Warsaw and eventually crippling four Soviet armies.|$|E
5|$|Agathaeromys is {{characterized}} {{mainly on the}} basis of features of the molar teeth. As usual in muroid rodents, there are three molars {{on both sides of the}} upper jaw (referred to as M1, M2, and M3 from <b>front</b> <b>to</b> back) and lower jaw (referred to as m1, m2, and m3). Agathaeromys is generally similar to other oryzomyines, but differs from other genera in a variety of details of the molar crowns. Agathaeromys donovani (M1 length 2.03–2.84 mm) is substantially larger than A.praeuniversitatis (M1 length 1.77–1.94 mm).|$|E
