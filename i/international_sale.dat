25|$|Honda's {{automotive}} manufacturing ambitions can {{be traced}} back to 1963, with the Honda T360, a kei car truck built for the Japanese market. This was followed by the two-door roadster, the Honda S500 also introduced in 1963. In 1965, Honda built a two-door commercial delivery van, called the Honda L700. Honda's first four-door sedan was not the Accord, but the air-cooled, four-cylinder, gasoline-powered Honda 1300 in 1969. The Civic was a hatchback that gained wide popularity internationally, but it wasn't the first two-door hatchback built. That was the Honda N360, another Kei car that was adapted for <b>international</b> <b>sale</b> as the N600. The Civic, which appeared in 1972 and replaced the N600 also had a smaller sibling that replaced the air-cooled N360, called the Honda Life that was water-cooled.|$|E

The first chapter deals with {{the definition of the}} term <b>international</b> <b>sales</b> contract in view of the practical and theoretical understanding, because the definition of an <b>international</b> <b>sales</b> contract has its own specifics in contrast to the definition of a sales contract in Czech law. The second chapter discusses the basic approaches of legal regulation in private international law and outlines the basic advantages and disadvantages of specific approaches of legal regulation in private international law in view of the <b>international</b> <b>sales</b> contract in this section. I put this chapter into my work for the better understanding and orientation of reader in issue of general regulation of <b>international</b> <b>sales</b> contract.

2500|$|Whilst early {{rules of}} trade and barter have existed since ancient times, modern laws of {{contract}} in the West are traceable from the industrial revolution (1750 onwards), when increasing numbers worked in factories for a cash wage. [...] In particular, the growing strength of the British economy and the adaptability and flexibility of the English common law led to a swift development of English contract law, while the more rigid civil law in Europe lagged behind. Colonies within the British empire (including the USA and the Dominions) would adopt {{the law of the}} mother country. [...] Civil law countries (especially Germany) later developed their own brand of contract law. [...] In the 20th century, the growth of export trade led to countries adopting international conventions, such as the Hague-Visby Rules and the UN Convention on Contracts for the <b>International</b> <b>Sale</b> of Goods, to promote uniform regulations.|$|E
2500|$|To apply one {{national}} legal system as against another {{may never be}} an entirely satisfactory approach. The parties' interests may always be better protected by applying a law conceived with international realities in mind. The Hague Conference on Private International Law is a treaty organization that oversees conventions designed to develop a uniform system. [...] The deliberations of the conference have recently {{been the subject of}} controversy over the extent of cross-border jurisdiction on electronic commerce and defamation issues. There is a general recognition {{that there is a need}} for an international law of contracts: for example, many nations have ratified the Vienna Convention on the <b>International</b> <b>Sale</b> of Goods, the Rome Convention on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations offers less specialized uniformity, and there is support for the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts, a private restatement, all of which represent continuing efforts to produce international standards as the internet and other technologies encourage ever more interstate commerce. But other branches of the law are less well served and the dominant trend remains the role of the forum law rather than a supranational system for Conflict purposes. Even the EU, which has institutions capable of creating uniform rules with direct effect, has failed to produce a universal system for the common market. Nevertheless, the Treaty of Amsterdam does confer authority on the Community's institutions to legislate by Council Regulation in this area with supranational effect. Article 177 would give the Court of Justice jurisdiction to interpret and apply their principles so, if the political will arises, uniformity may gradually emerge in letter. Whether the domestic courts of the Member States would be consistent in applying those letters is speculative.|$|E

International market involvement is defined as the various international business activities that generate sales from foreign markets (Alexander 1990; Vida et al. 2000).

Our main hypotheses are tested on a sample of 342 Norwegian firms via regression analysis. The results from this study show the existence, in both in family and non-family businesses, of a positive and significant relationship between foreign investors’ ownership and the level of <b>international</b> <b>sales.</b> Furthermore, the relationship between CEO ownership impacts negatively on <b>international</b> <b>sales</b> in both family and non-family businesses. While board strategic involvement contributes positively to <b>international</b> <b>sales</b> in non-family businesses it becomes not significant when we only look at family businesses.

However, innovations that present a mediating variable between <b>international</b> <b>sales</b> experience in the past and future sales are only significant in boosting domestic (and total sales), but not future <b>international</b> <b>sales.</b> In contrast, domestic sales experience in the past actually reduces the probability of firms developing innovations...|$|R
