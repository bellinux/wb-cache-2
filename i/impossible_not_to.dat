Jessica Suarez of Spin magazine compared [...] "Ooh La La" [...] with Black Cherrys [...] "Strict Machine", saying that the song sounds [...] "so simplistic that [...] minimalist repetition occasionally teeters over into redundancy".

500|$|Mark Kermode {{writing for}} The Observer awarded the film {{four out of}} five stars, lauding Thompson's {{performance}} as [...] "impeccable", elaborating that [...] "Thompson dances her way through Travers' conflicting emotions, giving us a fully rounded portrait of a person who is hard to like but <b>impossible</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> love." [...] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune felt similarly, writing: [...] "Thompson's the show. Each withering put-down, every jaundiced utterance, lands with a little ping." [...] In regard to the screenplay, he wrote that [...] "screenwriters Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith treat everyone gently and with the utmost respect." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone also gave the film three out of four stars and equally commended the performances of the cast.|$|E
500|$|The game's {{weapons were}} very well received. Edge praised their weight, stating that each weapon {{encourages}} strategic {{play with their}} secondary functions. Critics generally agreed that the roll and cover system worked well and {{that they did not}} feel overpowered, but some criticised the fact that players need to be in a specific spot to use the cover mode. Reviewers considered the story and voice acting to be weak. IGN said that it is almost <b>impossible</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> notice how [...] "laughably bad it is", and that many plot twists are presented then never resolved, but also admitted that it does not really factor into the gameplay. GameCritics reviewer Mike Bracken commented, [...] "It's always sad when there's voice acting in a game and I find myself being embarrassed for the voice actors." [...] Nevertheless, GameSpot added that the game's weapon fire and musical score [...] "easily drown this out." ...|$|E
500|$|Beddard {{explains}} in his preface {{that the book}} grew from his 1890 Davis Lectures given for the public at London Zoo. The book [...] "contains hardly anything novel, but professes to give some account of the principal phenomena of coloration exhibited by animals." [...] He also notes that since Poulton's recent book [...] "deal with colour almost entirely {{from the point of}} view of natural selection, I have attempted to lay some stress upon other aspects of the question." [...] Similarly, because Poulton treated insects in some detail, Beddard chooses to give more attention to other groups, though [...] "it is <b>impossible</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> devote a good deal of space to insects". The examples are mainly from Beddard's own observation of [...] "animals that may be usually seen in the Zoological Society's Gardens", though he also introduces and quotes the work of other scientists, including Henry Walter Bates and Alfred Russel Wallace.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} was not devoid of criticism. Charlotte O'Sullivan from the London Evening Standard gave a more negative assessment of Elsa, {{saying that she}} [...] "resembles one of those brittle mentors on The X Factor. Purple eyeshadow, tiny waist, kitten heels". Anna Smith of The Guardian disliked that both Elsa and Anna were drawn with slender figures and large eyes as is typical of Disney princesses. Slate's Dana Stevens wrote that [...] "it's <b>impossible</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> thrill to Elsa's surging sense of power" [...] but criticized the choice to illustrate her growing confidence by changing her appearance; Stevens further {{expressed concern that the}} switch from the character's modest coronation gown to [...] "a slinky, slit-to-the-thigh dress with a transparent snowflake-patterned train and a pair of silver-white high heels" [...] and a hairstyle that suggested [...] "come-hither bad-girl seduction" [...] was overly sexual. [...] Christy Lemire compared Elsa to Carrie White, another well-known fictional female who unleashes magical powers when agitated.|$|E
500|$|Keith DeCandido, {{writing for}} Tor.com, said that Garak {{could have been}} a [...] "walking, talking cliché", and that Robinson [...] "imbues him with such charm that it’s <b>impossible</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> love the character". He said that it was an {{excellent}} episode, {{due in part to the}} way that the character's dynamics are formed. He gave it a rating of eight out of ten. Zack Handlen in his review for The A.V. Club, said that Garak was [...] "striking" [...] from his first appearance, and it was immediately apparent that he was an important character. He compared Kira's problem of loyalty to those experienced by Ro Laren in The Next Generation episode [...] "", however it didn't work as well since the show would have to maintain the status quo by the end of the episode since Kira was a main character. He summarised, saying that it was a good episode but not great.|$|E
500|$|Scarface {{provoked}} outrage {{mainly because}} of its unprecedented violence, but also for its shifts of tone from serious to comedic. Dave Kehr, writing in the Chicago Reader, stated that the film blends [...] "comedy and horror {{in a manner that}} suggests Chico Marx let loose with a live machine gun." [...] In one scene, Camonte is inside a cafe while a torrent of machine-gun fire from the car of a rival gang is headed his way; when the barrage is over, Camonte picks up one of the newly released tommy guns the gangsters dropped and exhibits childlike wonder and unrestrained excitement over the new toy. Civic leaders became furious that gangsters like Capone (who was also the inspiration for Little Caesar) were being applauded in movie houses all across America. The screenplay, adapted by Ben Hecht who was a journalist in Chicago, contained biographical details for Muni's character in Scarface that were so obviously taken from Capone, and the detail so close, that it was <b>impossible</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> draw the parallels.|$|E

500|$|Glee {{received}} a Metacritic score of 78 out of 100 {{in its first}} season, based on reviews by eighteen critics, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". It was praised by several critics in year-end [...] "best of" [...] reviews in 2009. James Poniewozik of Time ranked it the eighth best television show of the year, commenting: [...] "when Glee works—which is often—it is transcendent, tear-jerking and thrilling like nothing else on TV." [...] Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker ranked it ninth, calling it [...] "Hands down the year's most novel show [...] also its least likely success", Lisa Respers France of CNN wrote that while ordinarily Glee premise would have been [...] "a recipe for disaster", the show has [...] "such quirky charm and bravado that it is <b>impossible</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> get swept up". Reviews for subsequent seasons on Metacritic, reflecting their initial episodes, were not quite as good—the second season's score was 76 out of 100 from eleven reviews, and the fourth season {{received a}} score of 73 out of 100 from six reviews. Even with these stellar reviews from a multitude of critics, Glee's later seasons lost millions of viewers.|$|E
500|$|While critics praised Morgan for his {{performance}} in the role, their reaction to the character has generally been mixed. Don Williams of BuddyTV felt that John is a [...] "rather divisive character", with some fans not understanding John's motivation for keeping his sons in the dark. However, Williams himself found the character to be [...] "completely fascinating". He chose [...] "In My Time of Dying" [...] as the second best episode of the series, mainly because of John's contributions, stating, [...] "Even if you're not {{a huge fan of}} Poppa Winchester, I think it's <b>impossible</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be moved by the final ten minutes of this episode... John's final speech to Dean, where he finally tells his son that he's proud of him, is one hell of a tear-jerker, and both Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Jensen Ackles knock that scene out of the park." [...] Williams praised Matt Cohen's performance of a younger version of the character in the time-travel episode [...] "In the Beginning", believing that he [...] "did an excellent job at portraying a more innocent John Winchester than we've ever seen before".|$|E

500|$|Charles Onyett from IGN applauded Gravity Bone, {{saying that}} it is [...] "a game that appears to toy with the notions of heroism and villainy, and the ways the player {{identifies}} with, and is directed toward, both roles." [...] He praised all aspects of the game, commenting, [...] "the cohesiveness of its striking visual presentation, soundtrack and effects, and almost entirely incomprehensible story combine to create an atmosphere of peculiar strength." [...] Onyett concluded his preview of the game by stating, [...] "it's a pleasure to experience, and never ceases to delight and surprise over its short run." [...] Anthony Burch from Destructoid gave a positive review, stating that it [...] "is so stylistically unified, so consistently cool and weird and imaginative, that it's damn near <b>impossible</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> fall in love with—even as the game ends and you're wondering what the hell happened, and why." [...] He also applauded several technical and design aspects of the game, expressing appreciation for the game's [...] "stylistic choices", as well as the [...] "nigh unbelievable" [...] bloom effects featured in the game. Burch concluded that Gravity Bone is [...] "a great ride", and that the [...] "atmosphere and style alone will barrel you through to the journey's end, which comes all too soon." ...|$|E

Combine it with production by Mark Ronson that references four decades worth of soul music without once ripping it off, and you've got the best song of 2007." [...] The album's second single and lead single in the US, [...] "You Know I'm No Good," [...] was released in January 2007 with a remix featuring rap vocals by Ghostface Killah. It ultimately reached number 18 on the UK singles chart.

500|$|Days after announcing Raimi's departure, {{the studio}} {{announced}} that Webb, whose previous film (500) Days of Summer was his directorial debut, would direct the reboot. Tolmach, {{now president of}} Columbia Pictures and Amy Pascal, co-chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, said they looked for a director who could give sharp focus to Parker's life. Webb said he [...] "was a little sceptical at first—you feel the presence of those other movies. But then I was like, 'How could I walk away from this? What an opportunity!'" [...] Webb said in the press release announcing him that, [...] "Sam Raimi's virtuoso rendering of Spider-Man is a humbling precedent to follow and build upon.

That would be <b>impossible.</b> <b>Not</b> <b>to</b> mention arrogant.
