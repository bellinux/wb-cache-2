However, her personal letters reveal that she could be strongheaded, sometimes at odds with her husband, and had a life of her ownâ€”albeit somewhat restricted. In a letter written on 2 May 1845 she stated: [...] "I wait for the moment when we will meet, good Pedro, and seek forgiveness for all that I <b>did</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> during these days." [...] In another letter of 24 January 1851, she acknowledged her difficult temperament: [...] "I am not irritated at you [...] and you should forgive me because this is my character." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Hiyya {{taught that}} the words of [...] "You shall do no unrighteousness in {{judgment}}," [...] apply to judgment in law. But a Midrash noted that [...] already mentioned judgment in law, and questioned why [...] would state the same proposition again and why [...] uses the words, [...] "in judgment, in measures." [...] The Midrash deduced that [...] teaches {{that a person who}} measures is called a judge, and one who falsifies measurements is called by the five names [...] "unrighteous," [...] "hated," [...] "repulsive," [...] "accursed," [...] and an [...] "abomination," [...] and is the cause of these five evils. Rabbi Banya said in the name of Rav Huna that the government comes and attacks that generation whose measures are false. The Midrash found support for this from [...] "A false balance is an abomination to the Lord," [...] which is followed by [...] "When presumption comes, then comes shame." [...] Reading [...] "Shall I be pure with wicked balances?" [...] Rabbi Berekiah said in the name of Rabbi Abba that it is impossible for a generation whose measures are false to be meritorious, for [...] continues, [...] "And with a bag of deceitful weights" [...] (showing that their holdings would be merely illusory). Rabbi Levi taught that Moses also hinted to Israel that a generation with false measures would be attacked. [...] warns, [...] "You shall not have in your bag diverse weights [...] [...] [...] you shall not have in your house diverse measures." [...] But if one does, one will be attacked, as [...] reports, [...] "For all who do such things, even all who do unrighteously, are an abomination to the Lord your God," [...] and then immediately following, [...] says, [...] "Remember what Amalek <b>did</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> (attacking Israel) by the way as you came forth out of Egypt." ...|$|E
