At first the work was done to supplement the income of local farmers and their families. The cloth woven in Leigh was fustian, a sort of rough corduroy, and by {{the end of the}} 17th century middlemen, fustian masters, were dealing directly with weavers and selling the finished cloth in Manchester.|$|E

High and stable removal of COD and TKN was achieved in the reactor, which can easily be setup in <b>dairy</b> <b>industries.</b> An active nitrifying population was selected during reactor operation and maintained relatively stable, while the heterotrophic (total and denitrifying) communities were more unstable and susceptible to changes in the operating conditions...|$|R
