Before spinning, the polymer flakes were first milled into powders and dried under vacuum. Viscosity-average molecular weight of PLLA following the fabrication process was monitored. Tensile properties of as-spun and hot-drawn fibers were investigated. Morphology of the PLLA fibers was viewed under a scanning electron microscope. Crystallinity of these fibers was assessed by thermogram analysis of differential scanning calorimetry. Results showed that the extent of decrease in the viscosity-average molecular weight of PLLA dropped sharply by 13. 1 - 19. 5 % during pulverization and by 39. 0 - 69. 0 % during melt-extrusion.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 3 rd Southern African Solar Energy Conference, South Africa, 11 - 13 May, 2015. Sanitary hot water production make up to over 50 % of the monthly electrical energy consumption in South Africa residential sector. Employing an effective and efficient mechanism for sanitary hot water heating {{can lead to a}} substantial energy saving and demand reduction as well as creating a benign environment owing to the decrease of the carbon dioxide emission. Most of the renewable energy devices for sanitary hot water heating utilized the free and abundant solar energy. Domestic air source heat pump (ASHP) water heater is one of the renewable energy device used for sanitary hot water production. In this study, a data acquisition system (DAS) was constructed to measure the predictors (E, electrical energy consumed) and (, average product of ambient temperature and relative humidity) and relevant parameters to compute the COP during the vapor compression refrigerant cycle (VCRC) of the ASHP unit. The coefficient of performance (COP) of an ASHP water heater under two different heating up cycle scenarios were critically examined. Modelling and simulation of the COP of the system provided a distinctive opportunity for optimization and prediction of its performance under different operational conditions. It was depicted that the mean COP in the both scenarios of the heating up cycles (firstly, where there was no successive <b>hot</b> water <b>draw</b> off and secondly, with simultaneous <b>hot</b> water <b>draw</b> off) was on average 2 and above. Finally, using the mathematical models in the both scenarios, it was revealed that increases in both predictors (E and ) can result to decrease in the COP. The one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test showed, the mean COP of 1. 96 and 2. 14 for the heating up scenario of simultaneous <b>hot</b> water <b>drawn</b> off and without a successive <b>hot</b> water <b>drawn</b> off. Predictors’ weight ranking demonstrated that the contribution from the input parameters was 100 times more during the heating up scenario whereby successive <b>hot</b> water <b>drawn</b> off occurred. The modelled equations were used in the mathematical blocks of the Simulink to design the simulation application of the COP of an ASHP water heater. We therefore concluded that the COP of an ASHP water heater during simultaneous <b>hot</b> water <b>drawn</b> off was higher than without successive <b>hot</b> water <b>drawn</b> off. cf 201...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSuperplastic-like forming is {{a recent}} {{developed}} sheet-forming process that combines <b>hot</b> <b>drawing</b> (mechanical pre-forming) with gas forming. It is {{an efficient way to}} form sheet metals into complex parts for automotive and aerospace industries. In comparison with conventional superplastic forming process, the forming time for superplastic-like forming can be significantly shortened as the hot-drawing step would have produced a pre-formed component before gas forming. The other advantage of the superplastic-like forming is its capacity for lower temperature forming, for which superplasticity is not possible. Non-superplastic grade Ti- 6 Al- 4 V sheets were successfully formed by superplastic-like forming at 800 °C in 16 min. The maximum percentage thinning of 54 % occurred at the outward corners. In this paper, electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) was used to examine the microstructure evolution of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V at different forming stages during superplastic-like forming process. Some small equiaxed grains, regarded as newly recrystallized grains, were observed near the deformed area after <b>hot</b> <b>drawing.</b> Grains became more randomly distributed as the recrystallization continued during gas forming stage.

40|$|Carbon nanofibers, though {{radially}} more homogeneous {{compared to}} carbon fibers, currently {{do not possess}} mechanical properties as high as carbon fibers. By principles of size effect, carbon nanofibers are expected to possess considerably higher strengths than carbon fibers. Theoretically, CNFs {{are expected to have}} strengths as high as 14 GPa. However, at present, CNFs possess strengths much lower than expected. The gap in theoretical and experimental work points to three main reasons: graphitic alignment in the nanofiber, radial structure of the nanofiber and presence of surface defects. The work presented in this dissertation aims at closing the gap via relating the microstructure and mechanical properties of carbon nanofibers. Graphitic alignment in carbon nanofibers imparts high modulus and strength to the fibers. This alignment of graphitic domains arises from the induced molecular alignment in precursor fiber. The precursor is polyacrylonitrile (PAN) fiber obtained from electrospinning of PAN in Dimethylformamide (DMF) solution. Limited molecular alignment is achievable with electrospinning, which creates the need to use other methods to improve molecular alignment. The research uses a method for <b>hot</b> <b>drawing,</b> which takes place at temperatures above the Tg of the polymer. The temperature aids chain mobility in the fiber, allowing it to stretch. The molecular alignment obtained in the <b>hot</b> <b>drawing</b> process facilitates the improvement in graphitic alignment in the carbon nanofiber formed. The effect of this enhanced alignment on single carbon nanofibers is studied via mechanical tests performed on single carbon nanofibers, with diameters of 250 nm- 700 nm, using a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) device in conjunction with digital image correlation (DIC). It has been observed that improvement in the molecular alignment of the precursor fiber leads to improvement in strength and modulus of carbon nanofibers. This increase can be related to improvement in graphitic orientation and size of crystallites in the CNF. In summary, it has been observed that molecular alignment in the PAN fiber prior to the stabilization stage is crucial in the evolution of graphitic domains, which was achieved via <b>hot</b> <b>drawing.</b> This effort presents a systematic study of molecular alignment and its effect on the mechanical properties of CNFs.
