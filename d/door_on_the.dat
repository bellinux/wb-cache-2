5|$|After 1728, Hylton's second son, John Hylton, de jure 18th Baron Hylton added a {{complementary}} south wing (its foundation wall still extant), crenellations to both wings {{and removed the}} <b>door</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> north wing. He also changed the circular bartizan on {{the north end of}} the west front, to an octagonal turret and removed the portcullis from the west entrance.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the tower is divided by iron floors and spiral stairways into four stories. The ground floor was originally used for oil store, and it now houses the light equipment, including a generator. Access to the tower was originally through the ramped stone steps on the north, entering the first floor. This entrance was since sealed, and a steel <b>door</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground level is now used.|$|E
5|$|On {{each side}} on the entry of the cathedral is a stone {{crucifix}} and a holy water font. High {{on the left side}} there is a brick from the Lateran Basilica, and on the right side a jubilee 2000 medal. The crypt is accessed through the door in the right wall of the vestibule, then up to the organ matroneum and finally down through the <b>door</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> left wall. In the crypt, there is an oratory, as well as Catechism rooms and the office of the Caritas charity.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{with the}} {{delivery}} of the F-28s and 737s, all planes were named after Norwegian kings. The last three F-27s were also given such names. During the 1970s, Braathens SAFE took delivery of eleven 737s, supplementing the four F-28s. The third delivered, LN-SUA, had a cargo <b>door</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side, making it ideal for cargo flights. The three planes delivered in 1979 had extended range tanks making direct flights to the Canary Islands possible. In 1979, the company started looking into possible replacements for their fleet, considering larger aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The McCanns' {{children}} {{slept in}} a bedroom next to the front door, which the McCanns kept locked. The bedroom had one waist-high window with curtains and a metal exterior shutter, the latter controlled by a cord inside the window; the McCanns kept the curtains and shutter closed throughout the holiday. The window overlooked a narrow walkway and residents' car park, which was separated by a low wall from the street. Madeleine {{slept in a}} single bed next to the bedroom <b>door,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{opposite side of the}} room from the window, while the twins were in travel cots {{in the middle of the}} room.

5|$|The north-west corner {{tower is}} 14 feet by 10 feet 6 inches (4.3 by 3.20 m) across on the inside, with an {{entrance}} <b>door</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east side, and originally had a loft floor. It remains uncertain {{if there was}} a second corner tower built in the south-east corner of the castle complex; excavations in 1978 in one possible location failed to find any traces, and a geophysical survey in 1998 proved inconclusive.|$|E

5|$|The {{single storey}} 1855 {{refractory}} block {{is on the}} same axis as the main cell block to its east. It consists of twelve punishment cells and six dark cells with no light. The gallows chamber, built in 1888, is between this and the main cell block and relates to the colonial use of the prison. The gallows operated via a rope tied around a beam, over a trap <b>door,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper level. Opening the trap door would cause the condemned prisoner fall, and thus be hanged.|$|E
5|$|As the {{combined}} Texian force prepared for battle, they sent a messenger to instruct the alcalde {{of the city}} to surrender. At 11pm, the alcade responded that the town would remain neutral, neither surrendering nor fighting. Several of the locals did, however, supply axes to the Texian militia. The Texians divided themselves into four groups, each assigned a different approach to the presidio. In the pre-dawn hours of October 10, the Texians attacked. The lone sentinel managed to give the alarm but was immediately shot dead. The Texians quickly hacked through a <b>door</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> north wall of the fortress and ran to the interior courtyard. Hearing the commotion, the Mexican soldiers had lined the walls to defend the fort.|$|E
5|$|In the 15th {{century the}} {{clerestory}} {{was added to}} the nave, along with the Perpendicular two-storied south porch; these reconstruction works necessitated the repositioning of the <b>door</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> south aisle, and the building of the present-day western wall of the nave, with a great window and door also in the Perpendicular style. Stained glass windows were installed in the clerestory, but their contents were not recorded, and only small fragments of the mediaeval glass survive today: the arms of the Cheyne family, a human figure, and a shield with fragments of coloured glass, possibly the impaled arms of Woburn and Leicester. A staircase in the porch led to a parvise above; local tradition holds that Thomas Harding was held in the parvise prior to his execution in 1532. The porch also contains a stoup dating from the late 14th century, which although much damaged has survived all subsequent restorations and remodellings unaltered.|$|E

5|$|On {{the western}} end of the chapel is the narthex, which has entrances on the north, west, and south walls. An {{additional}} <b>door</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> chapel's north side opens onto the Hibben Garden, named in recognition of John Grier Hibben's role in the chapel's construction and dedication. The garden of evergreens was designed by H. Russell Butler, Jr. On the chapel's south side are an additional door at ground level to the east and an exterior pulpit, designed after one at Magdalen College, Oxford, and named Bright Pulpit, in honor of John Bright. The chapel is connected on its eastern side to Dickinson Hall by the Rothschild arch, symbolizing a connection between religion and scholarship. Cram resigned as Princeton's supervising architect over the inclusion of the arch, which he disliked; nonetheless, he participated in the chapel's 1928 dedication ceremony. Nearby is the Mather Sundial, a replica of the Turnbull Sundial in the courtyard of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. A statue of a pelican, a religious symbol associated with Corpus Christi, sits atop the sundial, which was presented to Princeton in 1907 by William Mather, then the governor of Victoria University of Manchester.|$|E
5|$|The Anderson Street Station had a wood {{siding with}} a {{shingled}} roof, two brick chimneys {{off the roof}} and two asphalt platforms in both directions. The station also had a garage <b>door</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> southern side of the building. No official style of architecture was mentioned for Anderson Street in the 1920 Final Engineering Report {{due to lack of}} design. Nearby, a wooden watchman's shanty was constructed near the team track. The station had two tracks run through it (one main track and a team track) and had a rail crossing between tracks. By 1870, the tracks had been extended northward to Hillsdale, and public service began on the line on March 4 of that year. Trains terminated at Hillsdale with fare of only $0.75 (1870 USD), but just one year later, the extension northward. The service was extended northward to the community of Haverstraw, New York, and in 1896, the rail line was leased by the private company to the Erie Railroad.|$|E
5|$|The trams are bidirectional, with a driver's cab at each end. These cabs {{are built}} so the {{motorman}} can also sell tickets. The cab's have {{a door to}} close them off, so the riders cannot access rear cab. There are four doors on both sides; the front door is single while the three back doors are double. In addition to the front door, there is one door in each section. To operate the doors on the left side, the motorman must engage a security switch. It is also possible to open each individual <b>door</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right side from the driver's cab. Half the length is low-floor, with an entry height at , including {{three of the four}} doors. There are 88 seats, of which 64 are on the high-floor section, giving a total capacity of 212 riders.|$|E
