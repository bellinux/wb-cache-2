40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} the present study was to analyze the effect of perches and footpad {{dermatitis}} on stress and fear levels of chickens. In experiment 1 hetero-phil to lymphocyte ratio and tonic immobility duration were measured in 36 -wk-old hens (36 birds) from 2 Span-ish breeds of chickens (Black Menorca and Quail Castellana) housed in pens with or without perches from 20 wk of age. There was a significant difference in the heterophil to lymphocyte ratio between perch treatments (P < 0. 05), the ratio of <b>hens</b> with <b>perches</b> being lower than that of <b>hens</b> without <b>perches.</b> <b>Hens</b> with <b>perches</b> had significant lymphophilia (P < 0. 05). There was no signifi-cant difference for the duration of tonic immobility be-tween hens with or without <b>perches.</b> Thus, <b>hens</b> with <b>perches</b> were less stressed than <b>hens</b> without <b>perches,</b> as indicated by the heterophil to lymphocyte ratio. Hetero-phil to lymphocyte ratio and heterophil number for Black Menorcas were significantly smaller (P < 0. 001) than for Quail Castellanas, whereas lymphocyte number wa...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine minimum horizontal distance (HD) between <b>perches</b> for laying <b>hens</b> using qualitative and quantitative behavioral analysis. A real-time monitoring system was developed to record henâ€™s perching behaviors, such as the number of <b>perching</b> <b>hens,</b> <b>perching</b> duration, perching trips, and the pattern of perch occupancy. Three groups of sixteen W- 36 laying hens (68 weeks old at test onset) with prior perching experience were used. For each group, hens were kept in an enriched wire-mesh floor pen (1. 2 Ã— 1. 2 Ã— 1. 2 m) equipped with two parallel perches (15 cm perch space/hen). The HD between the perches were varied sequentially at 60, 40, 30, 25, 20, and 15 cm; then varied again in a reversed order. The minimum HD that led to no significant change in henâ€™s perching behavior was determined. Results showed that reduction of HD to 25 cm did not significantly restrain henâ€™s perching behavior; however, HD 3 ̆c 25 cm significantly reduced the proportion of <b>perching</b> <b>hens.</b> When HD was insufficient, more perching trips occurred during the 45 min prior to dark period, indicating increase in <b>perching</b> competition. Meanwhile, <b>hens</b> <b>perched</b> interlacing with one another and tended to perch outwards from the opposite <b>perch</b> or <b>hens</b> during dark period, which might be a strategy to use the perch more efficiently. Horizontal distance of 60 cm increased the perching duration and reduced the perching trips during light period; however these two behavioral responses were not affected by HD 3 ̆c 60 cm. Therefore, 25 cm is suggested as the minimum HD between laying-hen perches, 30 cm being preferable, and large HDâ€™s such as 60 cm not advisable...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine if thermally cooled <b>perches</b> improve <b>hen</b> immu-nity during hot summer. White Leghorn pullets at 16 week of age were randomly assigned to 18 cages of 3 banks at 9 hens per cage. Each bank was assigned to 1 of the 3 treatments up to 32 week of age: 1) thermally cooled perches, 2) perches with ambient air, and 3) cages without <b>perches.</b> <b>Hens</b> were exposed to natural ambient temperatures from June through September 2013 in Indiana with a 4 h acute heat episode at 27. 6 week of age. The packed cell volume, heterophil to lymphocyte (H/L) ratio, plasma concentrations of total IgG, and cytokines of interleukin- 1 β and interleukin- 6, plus lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-α factor were measured at both 27. 6 and 32 week of age. The mRNA expressions of these cytokines, toll-like receptor- 4, and inducible nitric oxide synthase were also examined in the spleen of 32 week-old hens. Except for H/L ratio, thermally cooled perches did not significantly improve currently measured immunological indicators. These results indicated that the ambient temperature of 2013 summer in Indiana (24 °C, 17. 1 to 33. 1 °C) was not high enough and the 4 h heat episode at 33. 3 °C (32 to 34. 6 °C) was insuffi-cient in length to evoke severe heat stress in <b>hens.</b> However, cooled <b>perch</b> <b>hens</b> had a lower H/L ratio than both air <b>perch</b> <b>hens</b> and control hens at 27. 6 week of age and it was still lower compared to control hens (P < 0. 05, respectively) at 32 week of age. The lowered H/L ratio of cooled <b>perch</b> <b>hens</b> may suggest that they were able to cope with acute heat stress more effectively than control hens. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of thermally cooled <b>perches</b> on <b>hen</b> health under higher ambient temperatures...|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} model for welfare assessment in laying hens was constructed. This model, named FOWEL (fowl welfare), uses {{a description of}} the production system as input and produces a welfare score as output. To assess the welfare status a formalized procedure based on scientific knowledge is applied. In FOWEL the production system is described using 25 attributes (space per hen, beak trimming, free range, etc.), each with two or more levels, together defining the characteristics of a production system. A weighting factor is used for each attribute, based on the available scientific knowledge {{of the effects of the}} attribute levels on the welfare aspects. The welfare score of a production system results from the attribute levels combined with the weighting factors. The results show that feeding level, space per <b>hen,</b> <b>perches,</b> water availability and nests were the most important attributes. The attribute free range was of minor importance. FOWEL includes a description of 22 production systems. The welfare score of cage systems was low, of barn and aviary systems medium, and of organic systems high. The presence of a free range resulted only in a small improvement in the welfare score...|$|R

40|$|High {{prevalence}} of keel bone fractures in laying hens is reported in all housing systems. Keel fractures {{have been associated}} with pain and restricted mobility in hens in loose housing. The objective was to determine whether keel fractures were associated with activity of hens in furnished cages. Thirty-six pairs of LSL Lite hens (72 wk) were enrolled in the study. One hen with a fractured keel and one hen without were identified by palpation in each of 36 groups of hens housed in either 30 or 60 -bird cages stocked at 750 cm 2 /hen. Behavioral activity of each hen was recorded by four observers blind to keel status using focal animal sampling for 10 min within a 2 hr period in the morning (08 : 00 - 10 : 00), afternoon (12 : 00 - 14 : 00), and evening (17 : 00 - 19 : 00). All hens were observed during each of the three sample periods for three days totaling 90 min, and individual hen data was summed for analysis. Hens were euthanized 48 hr after final observations, dissected, and classified by keel status: F 0 (no fracture, N= 24); F 1 (single fracture, N= 17); F 2 (multiple fractures, N= 31). The percentages of time hens performed each behavior were analyzed using a mixed procedure in SAS with fracture severity, body weight, cage size, rearing environment, and tier in the model. Fracture severity affected the duration of perching (P= 0. 04) and standing (P= 0. 001), bout length of standing (P< 0. 0001), and location (floor vs perch) of resting behaviors (P= 0. 01). F 2 <b>hens</b> <b>perched</b> longer than F 0 hens, 20. 0 % ± 2. 9 and 11. 6 % ± 3. 2. F 2 hens spent less time standing, 15. 2 % ± 1. 5, than F 0 and F 1 hens, 20. 7 % ± 1. 6 and 21. 6 % ± 1. 8. F 2 hens had shorter standing bouts (22. 0 sec ± 4. 2) than both F 0 and F 1 hens, 33. 1 sec ± 4. 3 and 27. 4 sec ± 4. 4. Non-fractured hens spent 80. 0 % ± 6. 9 of total resting time on the floor whereas F 1 and F 2 hens spent 56. 9 % ± 12. 4 and 51. 5 % ± 7. 7, resting on the floor. Behavioral differences reported here provide insight into possible causes of keel damage, or alternatively, indicate a coping strategy used to offset pain or restricted mobility caused by keel fractures...|$|R
40|$|Feather pecking (FP) {{can cause}} feather loss, {{resulting}} in physical injuries, which {{may lead to}} cannibalism. FP {{appears to be a}} redirection of foraging behavior, which intensifies when hens have difficulty coping with stress and fear. Dynamic environmental enrichment (EE) may allow expression of natural foraging behavior thus reducing conspecific pecking behavior and alleviating hen injury. Three treatments (plastic box: BOX; hay bale: HAY; and no enrichment: CON) were randomly applied to 30 identical floor pens (10 hens/pen; 10 pens/trt). At the pen level, hen behavior, and the number of severe FP (SFP), gentle FP (GFP), aggressive pecks (AP), and enrichment pecks (EP) were recorded from video prior to (21 wk) and after (24 wk) treatment implementation, and when hens were 27, 32, and 37 wk of age. A manual restraint test (MR) was performed immediately after behavioral observations and levels of blood serotonin (5 -HT) and glucocorticoids (GC) measured. Short-term (ST) and long-term (LT) analyses identified the impact of EE over the ST (21 vs. 24 wk of age) and LT (21 vs. all other ages) at the pen level. At the pen level, HAY (3. 18 ± 0. 33) tended to reduce GFP compared to CON (4. 10 ± 0. 34) over the ST (P = 0. 15) and LT (P = 0. 09), but did not impact the number of SFP, or AP over the ST or LT. More EP was observed in HAY (3. 56 ± 0. 14) than BOX (1. 61 ± 0. 18) throughout the study (P < 0. 0001). More HAY <b>hens</b> <b>perched</b> (P = 0. 05) at 24 wk (0. 28 ± 0. 12) compared to 21 wk (0. 19 ± 0. 11), and more HAY hens (3. 69 ± 0. 25) performed dust bathing compared to CON (4. 14 ± 0. 22, P = 0. 05) throughout the study. CON performed more struggles (1. 13 ± 0. 04, P = 0. 04) and were quicker to vocalize (4. 87 ± 0. 07 s, P = 0. 05) during MR than HAY (latency to vocalize(s) : 5. 16 ± 0. 05; number of struggles: 0. 96 ± 0. 05), counter-intuitively suggesting CON were less fearful. Treatment did not affect 5 -HT or GC. HAY appears to be a promising EE for mitigating GFP in non-cage laying hens. Future studies should examine the impact of EE on individual, rather than group-level responses. These results suggest that the presence of a hay bale is stimulating and may reduce GFP while encouraging hens to redirect pecking towards a dynamic and manipulable EE...|$|R
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{studied the}} effects of perches in furnished cages on behaviour and feed consumption of laying hens. The study used 352 Lohmann Selected Leghorn (LSL) hens. The hens were housed at 16 weeks of age in furnished cages in groups of 8 birds. The experiment lasted for 205 days. The treatments were: perches present from 16 weeks of age (P 16), perches present from 19 weeks of age (P 19), and no perches present (NP). Feed consumption and egg production were measured over the pre-laying period and six 4 -week laying periods. The number of <b>hens</b> on <b>perch,</b> in nest and litter box was recorded at various ages. The behaviour of 3 hens per treatment was observed using instantaneous sampling at every 5 minutes, so that the observations of each hen covered one light period (14. 5 hours). The treatments had no significant effects on feed consumption after the pre-laying period. Feed conversion ratio (kg feed kg- 1 eggs) was favourable in P 16 in comparison to NP during the periods 2 – 4. During the observations after the lights-out NP birds {{tended to be more}} frequently in nests, than P 16 birds. NP birds spent more time on the cage floor, were recumbent more often, and sitting more rarely in comparison to P 16 birds. Based on the results of this study, perches may have advantageous effect on feed conversion ratio in furnished cages...|$|R
50|$|Commandos were {{a product}} of the First Boer War during which the {{fiercely}} independent Boers had no regular army. When danger threatened, all the men in a district would form a militia organised into military units called commandos and would elect officers. Being civilian militia, each man wore what they wished, usually everyday neutral or earthtone khaki farming clothes such as a jacket, trousers and slouch hat. Each man brought his own weapon, usually a hunting rifle, and his own horses. The average Boer citizens who made up their commandos were farmers who had spent almost all their working life in the saddle, and because they had to depend on both their horse and their rifle for almost all of their meat, they were skilled hunters and expert marksmen. Most of the Boers had single-shot breech-loading rifles such as the Westley Richards, the Martini-Henry, or the Remington Rolling Block. Only a few had repeaters like the Winchester or the Swiss Vetterli. As hunters they had learned to fire from cover, from a prone position and to make the first shot count, knowing that if they missed the game would be long gone. At community gatherings, target shooting was a major sport and competitions used targets such as <b>hens</b> eggs <b>perched</b> on posts 100 yards away. The commandos became expert light cavalry, making use of every scrap of cover, from which they could pour an accurate and destructive fire at the British with their breech-loading rifles which could be rapidly aimed, fired, and reloaded.|$|R
40|$|AbstractConventional ‘battery’ cages for laying <b>hens</b> without <b>perches,</b> nests and litter {{areas have}} been banned by law {{throughout}} the European Union since 1 January 2012. As an alternative solution, enriched cage systems were introduced. Our aim was to investigate how many applications of litter substrate per day are necessary to motivate laying hens to perform dust bathing behaviour, {{and to what extent}} the hens use these offered litter areas in a species-appropriate manner. Each of the two consecutive experiments was conducted for 12 months, during which 20 (experiment 1) and 40 (experiment 2) laying hens of the strains Lohmann Selected Leghorn (LSL) and Lohmann Brown Classic (LB) were housed in 10 units of the enriched cage system HÜK 125 / 80 (2 hens/unit [(experiment 1], 4 hens/unit [experiment 2], same strain per unit). In defined daily application frequencies from one to four times (11 : 00 a. m., 1 : 00 p. m., 3 : 00 p. m. and 5 : 00 p. m.) over the laying period, 50 g conventional feed per application were applied as litter substrate onto each 925 cm 2 sized mat. The hens were recorded weekly by digital video systems. Results showed that the mean duration of dust bathing behaviour lasted 05 : 58 min in experiment 1 and 04 : 59 min in experiment 2. Litter application frequency had a significant effect on the dust bathing duration as well in experiment 1 (P< 0. 05) as experiment 2 (P< 0. 01). For both experiments the number of dust baths increased with the maximum number of litter applications per day and this linear trend is significant for experiment 2 (P< 0. 001). A high percentage of interrupted and early terminated dust bathing bouts were observed, mostly induced by a conspecific. The mean interruption duration was 00 : 18 min for experiment 1 and 00 : 45 min for experiment 2. The daily litter application frequency had no significant effect on the duration of interruptions for neither experiment but on the number of interruptions. According to the results of this study, litter applications at least twice a day can be recommended, and sufficiently sized dust bathing mats should be offered to laying hens housed in cage systems. Even with generously provided resources, the hens showed deficits in species–specific behaviour...|$|R

During a period of 5 weeks each group was exposed to 4 different perch arrangements: a single straight perch of 60 cm (P 60), a 30 cm perch crossing the middle of another perch of 30 (P 30 + 30), 45 (P 45 + 30) or 60 cm (P 60 + 30) long. 2. Perch arrangement influenced perch use. Perch occupancy (the mean number of <b>hens</b> using the <b>perches)</b> was lowest in the P 30 + 30 treatment during daytime, evening and night. Perch occupancy was lower for P 45 + 30 as compared both with P 60 + 30 during daytime and with P 60 during evening and night. Perch occupancy did not differ between P 60 and P 60 + 30. 3. Perch utilization (perch use per unit of total perch length provided) was lower for the three cross-wise perch arrangements as compared to P 60 indicating that the area near the crossing was not used optimally. 4. There were indications {{that the process of}} taking roosting positions was more disturbed with cross-wise perches. 5. Legislation and guidelines about the minimal <b>perch</b> length per <b>hen</b> should be refined {{to take into account the}} arrangement of the perches. A perch of 30 cm cross-wise to another perch should not be included in the total amount of perch length provided to the hens.
