5|$|Saltwater fish tend to lose water {{because of}} osmosis. Their <b>kidneys</b> return {{water to the}} body. The reverse happens in {{freshwater}} fish: they tend to gain water osmotically. Their <b>kidneys</b> produce dilute urine for excretion. Some fish have specially adapted <b>kidneys</b> that vary in function, allowing them to move from freshwater to saltwater.|$|E
5|$|In {{the male}} frog, the two testes are {{attached}} to the <b>kidneys</b> and semen passes into the <b>kidneys</b> through fine tubes called efferent ducts. It then travels on through the ureters, which are consequently known as urinogenital ducts. There is no penis, and sperm is ejected from the cloaca directly onto the eggs as the female lays them. The ovaries of the female frog are beside the <b>kidneys</b> and the eggs pass down a pair of oviducts and through the cloaca to the exterior.|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} are {{surrounded}} by a fatty capsule and lie within the renal fascia, which also surrounds the <b>kidneys.</b> A weak wall of connective tissue called septum separates the glands from the <b>kidneys.</b> The adrenal glands are directly below the diaphragm, and {{are attached to the}} crura of the diaphragm by the renal fascia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Kidney</b> failure can {{be divided}} into two categories: acute <b>kidney</b> injury or chronic <b>kidney</b> disease. The type of renal failure is {{differentiated}} by the trend in the serum creatinine; other factors that may help differentiate acute <b>kidney</b> injury from chronic <b>kidney</b> disease include anemia and the <b>kidney</b> size on sonography as chronic <b>kidney</b> disease generally leads to anemia and small <b>kidney</b> size.|$|R
50|$|<b>Kidney</b> disease, {{also known}} as {{nephropathy}} or renal disease, is damage to or disease of a <b>kidney.</b> Nephritis is inflammatory <b>kidney</b> disease. Nephrosis is noninflammatory <b>kidney</b> disease. <b>Kidney</b> disease usually causes <b>kidney</b> failure to some degree, with the amount {{depending on the type}} of disease. In precise usage, disease denotes the structural and causal disease entity whereas failure denotes the impaired <b>kidney</b> function. In common usage these meanings overlap; for example, the terms chronic <b>kidney</b> disease and chronic renal failure are usually considered synonymous. Acute <b>kidney</b> disease has often been called acute renal failure, although nephrologists now often tend to call it acute <b>kidney</b> injury. About 1 in 8 Americans suffer from chronic <b>kidney</b> disease.|$|R
50|$|Renal {{physiology}} is {{the study}} of <b>kidney</b> function, while nephrology is the medical specialty concerned with <b>kidney</b> diseases. Diseases of the <b>kidney</b> are diverse, but individuals with <b>kidney</b> disease frequently display characteristic clinical features. Common clinical conditions involving the <b>kidney</b> include the nephritic and nephrotic syndromes, renal cysts, acute <b>kidney</b> injury, chronic <b>kidney</b> disease, urinary tract infection, <b>kidney</b> stones, and urinary tract obstruction. Various cancers of the <b>kidney</b> exist. The most common adult renal cancer is renal cell carcinoma. Cancers, cysts, and some other renal conditions can be managed with removal of the <b>kidney.</b> This is known as nephrectomy. When renal function, measured by the glomerular filtration rate, is persistently poor, dialysis and <b>kidney</b> transplantation may be treatment options. Although they are not normally harmful, <b>kidney</b> stones can be extremely painful.|$|R
5|$|The {{adrenal glands}} may not develop at all, {{or may be}} fused in the midline behind the aorta.

5|$|At the hospital, {{the family}} learns that Peter's {{condition}} {{has a big}} chance of suddenly failing and thus killing him. They learn that the only other option besides the daily procedures is that one must give up one of their <b>kidneys</b> to Peter. Lois volunteers to give up one of hers, but is informed that she isn't a match. Brian then also volunteers, and they discover {{that he has the}} same kidney type as Peter. However, as dog <b>kidneys</b> are smaller than human's, the donation requires both <b>kidneys.</b> If the procedure was successful, Brian would lose his life. Brian decides {{to go along with the}} procedure to save Peter's life. Reluctant to lose Brian, Stewie kidnaps him and takes him to the local playground, in hopes of staying there the rest of their lives. Brian convinces Stewie to let him go, stating that Stewie needs his father more than he needs his dog. The next day, Brian and Peter prepare to undergo the kidney transfer. However, Dr. Hartman reveals that he is also a match and has decided to donate one of his own <b>kidneys.</b> He also points that it was unlikely Peter would survive the surgery either, as there were doubts that using dog <b>kidneys</b> would work, meaning that Brian would have died for nothing. Thus, Brian's life is spared.|$|E
5|$|Henoch–Schönlein purpura is a small-vessel {{vasculitis}} {{in which}} complexes of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and complement component 3 (C3) are deposited on arterioles, capillaries, and venules. As with IgA nephropathy, serum levels of IgA {{are high in}} HSP and there are identical findings on renal biopsy; however, IgA nephropathy has a predilection for young adults while HSP is more predominant among children. Further, IgA nephropathy typically only affects the <b>kidneys</b> while HSP is a systemic disease. HSP involves the skin and connective tissues, scrotum, joints, gastrointestinal tract and <b>kidneys.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} {{manifestations of}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are controlled in different ways. The fibrofolliculomas {{can be removed}} surgically, through curettage, shave excision, skin resurfacing, or laser ablation; however, {{this is not a}} permanent solution as the tumors often recur. The renal and pulmonary symptoms are managed preventatively: CT scans, ultrasounds, or MRIs of the <b>kidneys</b> are recommended regularly, and family members are advised not to smoke. MRIs are the preferred method for surveillance of the <b>kidneys</b> in people with BHD because they do not carry the same risk of radiation complications as CT scans and are more sensitive than ultrasounds. Smokers with Birt–Hogg–Dubé have more severe pulmonary symptoms than non-smokers. Though nephrectomy is sometimes indicated, kidney tumors in cases of Birt–Hogg–Dubé are often removed without taking the whole kidney, in a procedure called partial nephrectomy. Knockout mouse studies have shown that administration of rapamycin may mitigate the effects of FLCN mutations on <b>kidneys</b> and improve renal cancer prognoses because of folliculin's interaction with the mTOR pathway.|$|E

40|$|Information about {{growth of}} <b>kidney</b> {{structures}} in early life is limited. In a population-based prospective cohort study, from foetal life onwards, we constructed reference curves for <b>kidney</b> growth {{from the third}} trimester of pregnancy until early childhood, using data from 1, 158 healthy children. <b>Kidney</b> size, defined as length, width, depth and volume, was measured in the third trimester of pregnancy and at the postnatal ages of 6 months and 24 months. Analyses were based on more than 2, 500 <b>kidney</b> measurements. In the third trimester of pregnancy and at 6 months of age all <b>kidney</b> measurements were larger in boys than in girls. At 24 months of age, these gender differences were only significant for left <b>kidney</b> structures and right <b>kidney</b> length. Both groups showed trends towards smaller left <b>kidney</b> measurements than right <b>kidney</b> measurements at all ages. Gender-specific reference curves based on post-conceptional and postnatal ages were constructed for left and right <b>kidney</b> length, width, depth and volume.
