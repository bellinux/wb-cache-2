The theatre originally seated 1,250 people and was constructed of two balconies with two boxes {{on each side of}} the stage. The theatre consisted of two parts: a 3,360 square-foot auditorium and a 2,220 square-foot stage area. Perhaps the greatest spectacle of the Opera House was its intricate design work. The 596 seats were upholstered with Turkish Morocco and velvet, and each box included its own hat rack, cane and umbrella holder. There were 250 gaslights, 37 sets of scenery and a drop curtain. The stage development was undoubtedly progressive and featured innovations such as the Edison light board and a series of trap doors to enable animals to be used during productions.

5000|$|The {{increasing}} number of caravan users in turn stimulated development of caravan parks. Private developers {{were the first to}} offer caravan parks from the late 1930s with modern facilities and structured layout. However, in the early 1950s, relatively few sites in Queensland offered the necessary infrastructure to accommodate caravanning needs. Calls for improvements to sites and facilities accompanied increased caravan usage. Advocates looked to the United States and the United Kingdom for examples of best practice in caravan parks. Caravanning guides and journals offered suggestions for layout and features. The publication Modern Caravan Parks offered advice to local authorities and others interested in establishing caravan parks. Suggestions included a more formal arrangement of space than camping required, characterised by grid or circular layouts and landscaped grounds. Features of caravan parks became a location near a main road, a prominent entrance, recreation room, brick amenities block, levelled concrete slabs, landscaping, <b>hose</b> <b>connections,</b> hot showers and electricity. They also had on-site caretakers/proprietors. Many parks offered on-site vans for rental. [...] "Tradespeople" [...] called to deliver essentials like bread and milk.

5000|$|Water damage can {{originate}} {{by different}} {{sources such as}} a broken dishwasher hose, a washing machine overflow, a dishwasher leakage, broken/leaking pipes, and clogged toilets. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, 13.7% of all water used in the home today {{can be attributed to}} plumbing leaks. [...] On average that is approximately 10,000 gallons of water per year wasted by leaks for each US home. A tiny, 1/8-inch crack in a pipe can release up to 250 gallons of water a day. According to Claims Magazine in August 2000, broken water pipes ranked second to hurricanes in terms of both the number of homes damaged and the amount of claims (on average $50,000 per insurance claim) costs in the US. Experts suggest that homeowners inspect and replace worn pipe fittings and <b>hose</b> <b>connections</b> to all household appliances that use water at least once a year. This includes washing machines, dishwashers, kitchen sinks and bathroom lavatories, refrigerator icemakers, water softeners and humidifiers.

50|$|A third {{test method}} to {{determine}} if ductwork is leaking to the outside {{is to use a}} pressure pan, which is a register cover with a pressure tap for a <b>hose</b> <b>connection.</b> With the house pressurized (or depressurized) to 50 Pa (-50 Pa) using a blower door, a pressure gauge is attached to the pressure pan by means of a hose. If the pressure difference is near zero, this indicates that the ductwork associated with that particular register is not connected to the outside. A pressure 5 Pa or above indicates that the duct work is connected to or leaking to the outside. A smaller pressure difference indicates greater leakage. This method does not quantify duct leakage, but serves to identify locations of ductwork runs that are leaking to the outside. It is more of a qualitative measure, used for fault isolation.|$|E
50|$|Alterations in {{thermoregulation}} {{in association}} with spaceflight could significantly affect a variety of spaceflight-associated activities including exercise as a countermeasure to muscle atrophy, cardiac deconditioning, and bone loss; extravehicular activity (EVA); and vehicle landing and egress. EVA suits and launch and entry or advanced crew escape suits (ACES) worn by ISS and Shuttle crewmembers are designed to provide an impermeable barrier between the wearer and the external environment. To compensate for lack of heat exchange through the fabrics of these suits, the EVA suit provides both liquid (conductive) and air (convective) cooling, while a liquid cooling garment is worn under the ACES {{in addition to a}} <b>hose</b> <b>connection</b> to forced orbiter cabin air. Thus, crewmembers with altered thermoregulatory capabilities are at even greater risk should failure of the cooling systems of these garments occur.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Accidents involving commercial vehicles have disastrous consequences; most of the times they result in human fatalities, environmental damage, traffic congestion leading to fuel wastage and associated productivity losses. Moreover, with the rapid increase in the commercial vehicles traffic over the past few years, improved preventive and active measures are necessary to minimize commercial vehicle accidents and to enhance the safety of our roadways. The brake system is one of the critical components in ensuring the safety of the vehicle on the road. In a recent National Traffic Safety Board's (NTSB) heavy truck inspection survey, {{it was found that the}} defects in brakes/brake adjustment account for an average 56 percent of the trucks being declared out of service. Worn brake pads and tires, air leaks at <b>hoses,</b> <b>connections,</b> valves and brake chambers of the airbrake system along with the significant time delay in the actuation of tractor and trailer brakes degrade the vehicle braking and handling performance thereby increasing the potential for fatal accidents. As a result, there is a need for the advanced diagnostic system that monitors the health of air brakes and thus aiding in preventing the accidents. Therefore, the research is to develop a diagnostic algorithm that enhance the preventive safety of the vehicle. This could be accomplished by developing a mathematical model for the air brake system of a commercial vehicle and then utilizing the fault detection algorithms using analytical redundancy in a dynamic system. This could be done by predicting the redundant measurements using some of the reliable sensors and comparing with that of the values from the model. Using the mismatch between these, error residuals can be generated that carry the signature of the health of the airbrake system. The algorithm could also be experimentally implemented and verify their efficacy on an air brake system in the laboratory. The focus of the work that is presented here is to develop a mathematical model of the air brake systems that suits the development of the diagnostic algorithm and also to set up a test bench for the experiments...|$|R
5000|$|Three Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs) were {{mounted on}} the orbiter's aft {{fuselage}} {{in the pattern of}} an equilateral triangle. These three liquid-fueled engines could be swiveled 10.5 degrees vertically and 8.5 degrees horizontally during the rocket-powered ascent of the orbiter in order to change the direction of their thrust. Hence, they steered the entire Space Shuttle, as well as providing rocket thrust towards orbit. The aft fuselage also housed three auxiliary power units (APU). The APUs chemically converted hydrazine fuel from a liquid state to a gas state, powering a hydraulic pump which supplied pressure for all of the hydraulic system, including the hydraulic sub-system that pointed the three main liquid-fueled rocket engines, under computerized flight control. The hydraulic pressure generated was also used to control all of the orbiter's [...] "flight control surfaces" [...] (the elevons, rudder, speed brake, etc.), to deploy the landing gear of the orbiter, and to retract the umbilical <b>hose</b> <b>connection</b> doors located near the rear landing gear, which supplied the orbiter's SSMEs with liquid hydrogen and oxygen from the external tank.|$|E
50|$|A {{young boy}} named Jimmy is devastated after {{learning}} {{of the death of}} famed train engineer Casey Jones with whom he was good friends. In the following years, he grows up to be a train engineer, too. One morning, as Jimmy is piloting his train the brakes lose their air pressure, and the train roars along unable to be slowed or stopped. Jimmy tells the mechanic to fix it, but knowing that there is a sharp curve coming up soon and that the train will go off the tracks the mechanic jumps off the train instead. Jimmy then grabs a wrench and climbs out onto the side of the engine to try to fix it himself, but while stretching to reach the loose <b>hose</b> <b>connection</b> he is jostled and falls off the train just moments before it goes off the tracks at the curve. Unfortunately, gossip around town is that Jimmy jumped off his train two and a half miles before the curve, which was untrue, and he is branded a coward. Worse, he did not let other trains know, and as a result he is let go as engineer. The fact that Jimmy did not sign up and volunteer for army duty, as many other boys did at the time, also rankled many and added heavily to the idea that he was a coward. Actually, he had planned to sign up but his mother had a heart attack and the doctor told him if he did his mother would likely have another heart attack and it would be fatal this time. One of Jimmy's closest coworkers, who trusts him implicitly and doesn't believe the gossip, convinces the railroad to rehire him, though they will not make him an engineer again. The best they offer is a position as fireman on the train engineered by his friend (who humbly denies to Jimmy that he {{had anything to do with}} getting him back in).|$|E

50|$|In West Manila, Maynilad {{initiated}} early {{attempts to}} connect the poor in slums {{through the construction of}} piped networks by a small local company called IWADCO (Inpart Waterworks and Development Company) using its own funds and buying water in bulk from the utilities. Local banks initially refused to lend to the company even when it already had 25,000 paying customers. A NGO called Streams of Knowledge, which is associated with the Philippine Center for Water and Sanitation and was supported by UNDP, helped to set up the arrangement together with the local government and Maynilad which provides water at a discounted bulk rate. Users pay their water bills to water coordinators from the respective communities, which in turn pay Streams, which in turn pays a salary to the coordinator, pays the bulk water bill and returns part of the funds to the community. Maynilad built the piped network only to supply points at the entry of narrow alleys, from where residents distributed it among themselves with rubber <b>hoses.</b> A <b>connection</b> fee of 5000 Pesos (about US$90) was paid in instalments, resulting in monthly payments of about 200 Pesos (US$3.70) per household. This was about four times less than what the poor had paid to water vendors before. Maynilad pursued an approach to connect poor communities that included laying pipes in slums, which made it difficult to control theft. Indeed, non-revenue water even increased in West Manila.|$|R
