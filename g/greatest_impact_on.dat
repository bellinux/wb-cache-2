5|$|Besides the {{architecture}} encompassing the oldest artworks in Croatia, {{there is a}} long history of artists in Croatia reaching to the Middle Ages. In that period the stone portal of the Trogir Cathedral was made by Radovan, representing the most important monument of Romanesque sculpture from Medieval Croatia. The Renaissance had the <b>greatest</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the Adriatic Sea coast since the remainder of Croatia was embroiled in the Hundred Years' Croatian–Ottoman War. With the waning of the Ottoman Empire, art flourished during the Baroque and Rococo. The 19th and the 20th centuries brought about affirmation of numerous Croatian artisans, helped by several patrons of the arts such as bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer. Croatian artists of the period achieving worldwide renown were Vlaho Bukovac and Ivan Meštrović.|$|E
5|$|It was not Burr, but the Romantic {{poet and}} writer Percy Bysshe Shelley {{who had the}} <b>greatest</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> Imlay and her sisters' lives. Impressed by Godwin's Political Justice, Shelley wrote to him and the two started corresponding. In 1812, Shelley asked if Imlay, then 18 and the {{daughter}} {{of one of his}} heroes, Mary Wollstonecraft, could come live with him, his new wife, and her sister. Having never actually met Shelley and being sceptical of his motivations (Shelley had eloped to marry his wife, Harriet), Godwin refused. When Shelley finally came to visit the Godwins, all three girls were enamoured of him, particularly Imlay. Both Shelley and Imlay were interested in discussing radical politics; for example, Shelley liked to act as if class were irrelevant, but she argued that it was significant in daily affairs.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} {{began with}} an isolated F2 over the Florida Keys on August26; no tornadoes were recorded the following day as the storm traversed the Gulf of Mexico. Four weak tornadoes were observed on August28 as the hurricane approached land, each causing little damage. Coincident with Katrina's landfall, activity began in earnest on August29 with numerous tornadoes touching down across Gulf Coast states. Georgia suffered the <b>greatest</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> this day, with multiple F1 and F2 tornadoes causing significant damage; one person died in Carroll County, marking the first known instance of a tornado-related death in the state during August. A record 18tornadoes touched down across Georgia on August29, far exceeding the previous daily record of just 2tornadoes for the month throughout the state. Activity diminished over the subsequent two days as the former hurricane moved northward. Several more tornadoes touched down across the Mid-Atlantic states before the cessation of the outbreak just after midnight local time on August31.|$|E

Based on {{the results from this}} study, it is proclaimed that interactive read-alouds have a <b>greater</b> <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> student comprehension than non-interactive read-alouds. The use of interactive read-alouds in a classroom setting will lead to higher levels of participation and engagement among students and eventually lead to student independence...|$|R
