50|$|The ALE-47 {{consists}} of a cockpit control <b>unit,</b> <b>sequencer</b> <b>units,</b> countermeasure dispensers and an optional programmer. The cockpit control unit provides an interface with the pilot. A programmer {{can be added to}} add extra features, such as advanced threat evaluation. It {{can also be used to}} fully integrate the system with an aircraft's glass cockpit eliminating the need for the cockpit control <b>unit.</b> The <b>sequencer</b> <b>units</b> control the dispensers, and are automatically capable of detecting misfires and correcting them. The sequencers are built into the dispenser units on the rotary-wing version. Each dispenser can hold five different types of countermeasures for a total of 30. The whole system can accommodate up to 32 dispensers on fixed-wing aircraft and 16 on rotary-wing aircraft.|$|R
50|$|However, the IMP {{would become}} crucial if manual {{retrorocket}} activation became compromised by failure {{of either the}} <b>flight</b> <b>sequencer</b> or communications with mission control, as did happen on Voskhod 2. Furthermore, given the scarcity of Soviet communication stations on Earth, the cosmonauts {{spent most of their}} time out of range with ground control and needed instruments to assess their position relative to the ground.|$|R

[...] The pitch program was provided by a cam device located in the Servo Loop Amplifier Box. The sequence of events was controlled by a program device that was also used on Jupiter missiles. This was a 6-track tape recorder that sent pulses {{to a set of}} relays (the <b>flight</b> <b>sequencer)</b> to activate and deactivate various circuits in a precisely timed sequence.|$|R
50|$|The chip was {{designed}} to suit a wide variety applications and had support for external L2 cache and symmetric multiprocessing. It had four functional units, including a floating point unit, an integer unit, a branch <b>unit</b> and a <b>sequencer</b> <b>unit.</b> The processor also included a memory management unit. The integer pipeline was four stages long, the branch pipeline two stages long, the memory pipeline five stages long, and the floating-point pipeline six stages long.|$|R

This computer is optimized for {{the activities of the}} flight and contains very little human interface hardware and software. The computer system provides the technicians testing of Spartan ACS with a convenient command-oriented interface to the flight ACS computer. The system also decodes and time tags data automatically sent out by the flight computer as key events occur. The duration and magnitude of all system maneuvers is also derived and displayed by this system.

50|$|The Russian early {{missions}} {{were mostly}} automated and controlled from the mission control center (the TsUP). The spacecraft essentially controlled itself, and the cosmonauts {{were expected to}} initiate maneuvers or corrections only after approval from the MCC and according to its data and parameters. Therefore, the instrumentation available to the pilot was minimal and its operational relevance was limited to contingency scenarios as much as possible. The readings from the IMP were primarily intended to help cosmonaut pilots confirm that the automated <b>flight</b> <b>sequencer</b> was operating normally. The data would also keep the crew aware of their position when they were orbiting over the nighttime part of the Earth, or when the spacecraft's viewports and Vzor periscope couldn't be pointed toward the ground.|$|R
50|$|The RSC {{operated}} at {{frequencies of}} 33 and 45 MHz. It has three execution units: a fixed point unit, floating point unit and branch processor; and an 8 KB unified instruction and data cache. Like the POWER1, the memory controller and I/O was tightly integrated, with the functional units {{responsible for the}} functions: a memory interface <b>unit</b> and <b>sequencer</b> unit; residing on the same die as the processor. The RSC contains nine functional units: fixed-point execution unit (FXU), floating-point execution unit (FPU), the memory management unit (MMU), memory interface <b>unit</b> (MIU), <b>sequencer</b> <b>unit,</b> common on-chip processor unit (COP), instruction fetch unit, and instruction queue and dispatch unit.|$|R
50|$|Prior to launch, {{latitude}} and longitude were adjusted to the precalculated coordinates of entering orbit. Right after the launch phase, once the orbit was established, its parameters were precisely measured by radar and radio telemetry from the ground. Revised settings for the IMP were then computed {{on the ground and}} communicated to the crew, which reset the instrument's three orbital Correction parameters, the equatorial longitude and the present point in the orbit using the two КОРРЕКЦИЯ knobs, the Э knob and the О knob. After this, the cosmonauts toggled the activation switch on the left-side Control panel. This last action connected the <b>flight</b> <b>sequencer</b> system's impulses to the instrument's solenoid actuator. These impulses were then converted into a slow, regular mechanical advance which cascaded through the mechanical components, effecting the computations needed to move the globe and other indicators.|$|R

40|$|Stereo PIV {{measurements}} on a 2 - and 4 -vortex system {{have been performed}} in a large tow tank of SVA (Schiffbau-Versuchsanstalt Potsdam GmbH). The considered 4 -vortex system consists of two counter-rotating vortex pairs with a span width ratio of b 2 /b 1 = 0. 3 and a circulation ratio of Γ 2 /Γ 1 = - 0. 3. For comparisons also the corresponding 2 -vortex system is measured. A submersible Stereo PIV system attached to a vertical traversing system was employed. Cross-sectional velocity fields are obtained of the descending wake vortex system to access the vortex dynamics well into the wake far field. The SVA provided the necessary measurement equipment consisting of a submersible Stereo PIV system, a vertical traversing system and a six component force balance. DLR provided the vortex generator (F 13 model), a programmable <b>sequencer</b> <b>unit</b> enabling an adaption of the PIV recording system to the high dynamic range of the velocity fields and defined the test program of the measurement campaign...|$|R

40|$|The {{flow field}} {{characteristics}} of a two-pass cooling system with an engine-similar lay-out have been investigated experimentally using the non-intrusive Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). It consists of a trapezoidal inlet duct, a nearly rectangular outlet duct, and a sharp 180 degree turn. The system has been investigated with smooth and ribbed walls. Ribs are applied on two opposite walls in a symmetric orientation inclined with an angle of 45 degrees to the main flow direction. The configuration was analyzed with the planar two component PIV technique (2 C PIV), which is capable of obtaining complete maps of the instantaneous {{as well as the}} averaged flow field even at high levels of turbulence. In the past, slip between motor and channel rotation causes additional not negligible uncertainties during PIV measurements due to unstable image position. These were caused by the working principle of the standard programmable <b>sequencer</b> <b>unit</b> used in combination with unsteady variations of the rotation speed. Therefore, a new sequencer was developed using FPGA-based hardware and software components from National Instruments which revealed a significant increase of the stability of the image position. Furthermore, general enhancements of the operability of the PIV system were achieved. The presented investigations of the secondary flow were conducted in stationary and, with the new sequencer technique applied, in rotating mode. Especially in the bend region vortices with high local turbulence were found. The ribs also change the fluid motion as desired by generating additional vortices impinging {{the leading edge of the}} first pass. The flow is turbulent and isothermal, no buoyancy forces are active. The flow was investigated at Reynolds number of Re = 50, 000, based on the reference length d (see Fig. 3). The rotation number is Ro = 0 (non-rotating) and 0. 1. This investigation is aimed to analyze the complex flow phenomena caused by the interaction of several vortices, generated by rotation, flow turning or inclined wall ribs. The flow maps obtained with PIV are of good quality and high spatial resolution and therefore provide a test case for the development and validation of numerical flow simulation tools with special regard to prediction of flow turbulence under rotational flow regime as typical for turbomachinery. Future work will include the investigation of buoyancy effects to the rotational flow. This implicates wall heating which result from the heater glass in order to provide transparent models. ...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{demanding}} tasks that must be performed by the Space Shuttle flight crew is the process of determining whether, when and where to abort the vehicle should engine or system failures occur during ascent or entry. Current Shuttle abort procedures involve paging through complicated paper checklists to decide on the type of abort and where to abort. Additional checklists then lead the crew through a series of actions to execute the desired abort. This process is even more difficult and time consuming in the absence of ground communications since the ground flight controllers have the analysis tools and information that is currently not available in the Shuttle cockpit. Crew workload specifically abort procedures will be greatly simplified with the implementation of the Space Shuttle Cockpit Avionics Upgrade (CAU) project. The intent of CAU is to maximize crew situational awareness and reduce flight workload thru enhanced controls and displays, and onboard abort assessment and determination capability. SAFM was developed to help satisfy the CAU objectives by providing the crew with dynamic information about the capability of the vehicle to perform a variety of abort options during ascent and entry. This paper- presents an overview of the SAFM application. As shown in Figure 1, SAFM processes the vehicle navigation state and other guidance information to provide the CAU displays with evaluations of abort options, as well as landing site recommendations. This is accomplished by three main SAFM components: the Sequencer Executive, the Powered Flight Function, and the Glided <b>Flight</b> Function, The <b>Sequencer</b> Executive dispatches the Powered and Glided Flight Functions to evaluate the vehicle's capability to execute the current mission (or current abort), as well as more than IS hypothetical abort options or scenarios. Scenarios are sequenced and evaluated throughout powered and glided flight. Abort scenarios evaluated include Abort to Orbit (ATO), Transatlantic Abort Landing (TAL), East Coast Abort Landing (ECAL) and Return to Launch Site (RTLS). Sequential and simultaneous engine failures are assessed and landing footprint information is provided during actual entry scenarios as well as hypothetical "loss of thrust now" scenarios during ascent...|$|R
