In March 2008 the Express Group paid the fund £550,000 and £375,000 {{in the form}} of libel damages arising out of articles about the McCanns and Tapas Seven respectively. In 2011 Kate McCann's book, Madeleine, was serialized by The Sun and The Sunday Times, both owned by News International, for a payment to the fund of ₤500,000 to ₤1 million. In December 2015 the fund stood at around ₤750,000. As of February 2017 it had seven directors, including the McCanns.|$|E

Between May 2007 and March 2008, the Fund received £1,846,178, including £1.4 million through the bank, £390,000 online, and £64,000 from merchandise. Donations included £250,000 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>News</b> of the World, £250,000 from Sir Philip Green, $50,000 from Simon Cowell, and $25,000 from Coleen Rooney. J. K. Rowling and Richard Branson made large donations; Branson donated £100,000 to a legal fund for the McCanns. The fund did not cover the couple's legal costs arising from their status as arguidos, but it was criticized in October 2007 for having made two of the McCanns' mortgage payments, before they were made arguidos.|$|E

25|$|The Journal {{editorial}} pages and columns, run separately <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> pages, are highly influential in American conservative circles.

Pat was eventually brought to trial and acquitted. She then fell in love with and married her lawyer, John Randolph (Michael M. Ryan).

25|$|Hearing rumours that Moguy {{wished to}} surrender, both Stockwell and Beaufre left their command ship HMS Tyne for Port Said. Upon landing, they learned the rumours were not true.

However, 35 minutes before the new channel went on air, a power failure spread through most of London, affecting BBC Television Centre, where BBC2's programme control was based. BBC1 and BBC News were unaffected as they were still based at Alexandra Palace. The first signs of the new identity were slides containing the BBC2 box logo with the caption 'Will start shortly'. The first night's transmission consisted of this slide interspersed with new bulletins, presented by Gerald Priestland, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> room at Alexandra Palace, which featured the new logo in the background. At 22.00, the launch night was abandoned and the programme line-up was aired the following evening. The first programme aired was Play School at 11am.|$|E

25|$|In the study, {{researchers}} created {{two versions}} of the same news story – one with compelling negative images and one without. Participants were asked to watch a 20 minute news video (half of the participants saw the negative images and the other half did not) and an additional ten-minute video. They were instructed to pay attention because they would be tested afterwards. A follow up survey was sent 6 to 7 weeks later to measure memory and recall <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> video. The results support the idea that people better remember information that comes after a negative event. Respondents who viewed the negative images better remembered {{the second half of the}} newscast than the part preceding the negative images. The findings of this study further support the media equation assumption that mediated experiences are the same as natural experiences.|$|E
25|$|A {{nationwide}} county-by-county {{breakdown of}} Bahá'í populations ranks some counties in South Carolina {{as among the}} highest in the nation, (with a few in Georgia and South Dakota also notable): Marion at 10%, Williamsburg at 7.2%, and Dillon at about 6.3% in 2010, though the area of the county of Colleton where levels of activity had been high, were less than a third and closer to the statewide average. The fact that the Bahá'ís formed the second largest percentage of the religious in the whole of South Carolina made the news in 2014 even convincing a skeptic - Mark Silk, and avowed atheist Herb Silverman, finding leader of Secular Coalition for America, took the opportunity <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> to check out the local Charleston Bahá'ís - and was favorably disposed. Coverage by WMBF News in eastern South Carolina occurred in February 2016.
