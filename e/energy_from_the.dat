5000|$|In quantum chemistry, {{calculations}} using finite basis {{sets are}} susceptible to basis set superposition error (BSSE). As the atoms of interacting molecules (or of {{different parts of the}} same molecule - intramolecular BSSE) approach one another, their basis functions overlap. Each monomer [...] "borrows" [...] functions from other nearby components, effectively increasing its basis set and improving the calculation of derived properties such as energy. If the total energy is minimised {{as a function of the}} system geometry, <b>the</b> short-range <b>energies</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mixed basis sets must be compared with <b>the</b> long-range <b>energies</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> unmixed sets, and this mismatch introduces an error.|$|R

5|$|Certain {{patterns}} of reflectivity are important clues for the meteorologist as well. The three body scatter spike is an example. This {{is the result}} of <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> radar hitting hail and being deflected to the ground, where they deflect back to the hail and then to the radar. The energy took more time to go from the hail to the ground and back, as opposed to the energy that went direct from the hail to the radar, and the echo is further away from the radar than the actual location of the hail on the same radial path, forming a cone of weaker reflectivities.|$|E
5|$|Chemolithotrophy {{is a type}} of {{metabolism}} {{found in}} prokaryotes where energy is obtained from the oxidation of inorganic compounds.

5|$|Storm petrels use {{a variety}} of {{techniques}} to aid flight. Most species will occasionally feed by surface pattering, holding and moving their feet on the water's surface while holding steady above the water. They remain stationary by hovering with rapid fluttering or by using the wind to anchor themselves in place. This method of feeding flight is more commonly used by Oceanitidae storm petrels however. Northern storm petrels also use dynamic soaring, gliding across wave fronts gaining <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> vertical wind gradient.|$|E

5|$|The {{aerodynamics}} of a {{wind turbine}} are not straightforward. The air flow at the blades {{is not the}} same as the airflow far away from the turbine. The very nature of the way in which energy is extracted from the air also causes air to be deflected by the turbine. In addition the aerodynamics of a wind turbine at the rotor surface exhibit phenomena that are rarely seen in other aerodynamic fields. The shape and dimensions of the blades of the wind turbine are determined by the aerodynamic performance required to efficiently extract <b>energy</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wind, and by the strength required to resist the forces on the blade.|$|E
