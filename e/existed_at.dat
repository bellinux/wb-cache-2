5|$|A manor had <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> Ashby-de-la-Zouch from {{at least}} 1086, when the {{location}} was known as Ascebi. The lands were acquired by Robert de Beaumont, the Count of Meulan and later Earl of Leicester, in 1100. He established the Belmeis family there as his tenants and, after the Belmeis family line died out in 1160, the earls of Leicester reassigned the estate to the le Zouch family, from whom the manor took its later name.|$|E
5|$|A {{supporter}} of nine-man baseball teams, Adams favored a measure in 1856 which allowed for players {{from outside the}} Knickerbockers to join their intrasquad games when 17 or fewer team members appeared. No rules <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> the time regarding team size, but official games between clubs were typically played with nine men per club. The proposal was defeated by a 13–11 vote, {{in favor of a}} rule forbidding non-club members to play if there were 14 players (seven per team).|$|E

The highway ran north along Harrison Road next to campus and across the Red Cedar River. North of the river, the trunkline terminated at the junction with Michigan Avenue (then M-39, now the unsigned M-143).|$|E
5|$|Carboniferous Period (359–299 {{million years}} ago) rocks are {{represented}} by the Carboniferous Limestone that forms the Mendip Hills, rising abruptly out of the flat landscape of the Somerset Levels and Moors. The limestones are very fossiliferous, and contain evidence of the abundant marine life that <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> {{the time of their}} creation, including fossil crinoids (sea-lilies), corals and brachiopods.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{also pointed}} out that the index could allow the city to reach lethally high levels of carbon {{monoxide}} without any alert if the levels of other pollutants remained low. However, the department had to contend with the fact that no universally accepted standards for recording smog <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> that time, and many of the flaws existed {{for lack of a better}} alternative. During the 1966 smog, one of the former commissioners said he would have readily adopted a better system, if one existed.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1980s, several sets of {{communication}} protocols emerged {{to fill the}} gaps between the data-link layer and the application layer of the OSI reference model. These included Appletalk, IPX, and NetBIOS with the dominant protocol set during the early 1990s being IPX due to its popularity with MS-DOS users. TCP/IP <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> this point, but it was typically only used by large government and research facilities.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} {{that at the time}} of the Norman Domesday book, {{settlements}} <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> Burnham and Huntspill, their common boundary running along what is now the Westhill Rhyne. The church at Burnham and its lands were given to Gloucester Abbey in the 12th century, later transferred to Wells Cathedral along with up to 50houses surrounding the church. Burnham was part of the hundred of Bempstone.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{breeding}} {{experiments with}} it and other Omphalotus species have revealed {{a low level of}} compatibility (ability to breed and produce fertile hybrids), suggesting it is genetically distinct and has been isolated for a long time. It is particularly poorly compatible with O.illudens, the authors of the study suggesting the separation may have been as long ago as the Late Carboniferous separation of Gondwana from Laurasia but conceding the lack of any fossil record makes it impossible to know whether the genus even <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> the time.|$|E

5|$|One of the adaptations made to Palladianism in America {{was that}} the piano nobile now tended {{to be placed on}} the ground floor, rather than above a service floor, as was the {{tradition}} in Europe. This service floor, if it <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> all, was now a discreet semi-basement. This negated the need for an ornate external staircase leading to the main entrance as in the more original Palladian designs. This would also be a feature of the neoclassical style that followed Palladianism.|$|E
5|$|Reconstruction of the {{historical}} development of Vithoba worship has been much debated. In particular, several alternative theories have been proposed regarding the earliest stages, as well as the point at which he came to be recognised as a distinct deity. The Pandurangashtakam stotra, a hymn attributed to Adi Shankaracharya of the 8th century, indicates that Vithoba worship might have already <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> an early date.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea for}} a tunnel under Loveland Pass <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> least since the 1940s. Serious {{discussion}} began when the state of Colorado lobbied for the Interstate Highway System to route a transcontinental highway across Colorado. After a round of negotiations with Utah officials, it was decided the best option was to follow the U.S. Route 6 corridor. Engineers recommended to tunnel under the pass, rather than attempt to build a route across it that conformed to Interstate Highway standards.|$|E
5|$|The small Asian {{mongoose}} (Herpestus javanicus) {{was introduced}} to Hawaii {{in order to control}} the rat population. However the mongoose was diurnal, and the rats emerged at night; so it preyed on the endemic birds of Hawaii, especially their eggs, more often than it ate the rats, and now both rats and mongooses threaten the birds. This introduction was undertaken without understanding the consequences of such an action. No regulations <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> the time, and more careful evaluation should prevent such releases now.|$|E
5|$|A 24-million-year-old fossil {{belonging}} to Triturus, perhaps a marbled newt, {{shows that the}} genus already <b>existed</b> <b>at</b> that time and contradicts the earlier estimate of 8.3 million years ago (mya) for the split between the crested and marbled newts and their sister genus, the European brook newts (Calotriton). An age calibration study based on this and other fossils places that divergence much earlier, at around 39 mya in the Eocene, with an uncertainty range of 47 to 34 mya. Based on this estimation, authors have investigated diversification within the genus and related it to paleogeography: The crested and marbled newts split between 30 and 24 mya, and the two species of marbled newts have been separated for 4.7–6.8 million years.|$|E
