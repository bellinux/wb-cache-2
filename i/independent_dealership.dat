50|$|Carter Machinery, {{founded in}} Virginia in 1952, is a {{producer}} of lubricants for engines and other mechanical purposes. By the 1980s, it also became the largest dealer in Caterpillar equipment in the United States, and it was acquired by Caterpillar, Inc. in 1988. Carterpillar contended that the acquisition, breaking its tradition of having only <b>independent</b> <b>dealerships,</b> was necessary to protect its right to dictate who could sell and service their product {{in the state of}} Virginia. Carter was bought out by its management in 2011, again becoming an independent dealer for Caterpillar.|$|R
50|$|The {{difficult}} {{economic situation}} in South America {{in the eighties}} due to astronomic inflation rates forced manufacturers to look into options that would help to save money. The Brazilian and Argentine subsidiaries of Ford and Volkswagen decided to merge into a new holding, named AutoLatina, in 1987. Volkswagen held 51% of the shares, and Ford the remaining 49%. Each brand maintained their own corporate image, the marketing and sales structures, as well as <b>independent</b> <b>dealerships</b> and service shops. All other departments were consolidated, allowing significant cost cutting, but also cutting the workforce almost in half.|$|R

50|$|Landmates {{existed in}} the Appleseed {{universe}} well before the events depicted even in the first book of the manga, The Promethean Challenge. While the industrial nation of Poseidon is credited with inventing them in the late 21st century, their extensive refinement and widespread public adoption {{is largely due to}} private-sector efforts in Olympus. Starting in 2124, first-generation handbuilt models were produced by automotive specialists and marketed as high-end personal transport or niche market construction machinery, and often sold alongside motorbikes and luxury automobiles at <b>independent</b> <b>dealerships.</b> Akechi Motors {{remains one of the most}} famous early dealers and promoters of the powered armor suits, as it was here that some of the very first Landmates designed for squad-based law enforcement and counter terrorism were designed, the brainchild of talented mechanic and engineer Yoshitsune Miyamoto.|$|R
2500|$|However, {{the biggest}} change was the {{decision}} to keep the MSRP (manufacturer's suggested retail price) of the base two-door model to within US$200 of the Volkswagen Beetle. The domestic Big Three automakers {{did not respond to}} this strategy, thus giving AMC a big price differential over the competing domestic models. Sales of the Rambler American increased and the showroom traffic boosted morale among AMC's <b>independent</b> <b>dealerships.</b> This was backed up by a marketing campaign stating, [...] "Either we're charging too little for our cars or everyone else is charging too much." [...] The promotion and lower prices were designed to rekindle the Rambler American as a practical and economical car in customers' minds. Advertisements by AMC's new agency, Wells, Rich, and Greene, headed by Mary Wells Lawrence violated the accepted rule of not attacking the competition.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) certification of automotive service technicians in <b>independent</b> <b>dealerships</b> enhanced job performance. Descriptive survey methodology was used to gather information for 100 automotive technicians (50 ASE-certified and 50 non-certified technicians) located in 50 different work sites. Each site’s service manager was asked to complete a questionnaire and a rating scale for two technicians, one ASE certified and one non-certified. The questionnaire was designed using expert opinions of automotive service managers and community college automotive instructors in the Triad area of North Carolina. The 28 -item Minnesota Satisfactoriness Scales (MSS) were used to assess job satisfactoriness. Responses to 95 completed questionnaires and accompanying MSS were included in statistical analyses. The role of these variables in predicting ratings of job performance was further examined by including the regression analyses of only those who had four or less years of on-the-job experience. Among certified technicians, higher scale scores and longer years of experience positively predicted ratings of job performance, as well as decreased numbers of customer complaints. Overall, certified technicians had higher mean job performance ratings than non-certified technicians...|$|R

5000|$|In 1970s, a {{traveling}} salesman {{by the name}} of Richard Peck worked as a sales and product manager for companies in Pennsylvania. His work took him from city to city and as he drove through these towns, he was saddened by the number of dead pets lying along highways and city streets. As an animal lover and an inventor he enjoyed searching for an effective solution to this apparent problem. The solution involved preventing pets from straying from their yards. An idea developed from the concept creating a type of [...] "Invisible Fence". In 1973, he received a patent for the concept to go about building the first invisible fence concept. Peck worked out the technology and formed a company called Stay-Put Sales Co. to market his product mainly through direct mail and magazines.Peck in the middle of marketing his invention realized that nationwide sales and distribution was beyond his interest. So in 1976, Peck sold the marketing and patent rights to John Purtell. He took his idea and created a company named Invisible Fence Co. Over his tenure with the company, he employed over 100 people directly and another 2,500 through its <b>independent</b> <b>dealerships</b> in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Europe.|$|R

[...] Model homes were erected in several locations around the country, including midtown Manhattan, where 60,000 visitors toured it in two weeks. Deluxe editions included several pieces of built-in steel furniture, and a combination washing machine and dishwasher in the kitchen. The company boasted of their minimal maintenance, imperviousness to fire, flood, decay and vermin, and advertised them as [...] "The House America's Been Waiting For" [...] and [...] "The House of Tomorrow". It sold homes through <b>independent</b> <b>dealerships</b> {{in a manner similar to}} automobile manufacturers. One was established in Albany; it is not clear if this was owned by Upstate or not. Dealers were required to pay Lustron in cash for the houses, then bear the costs of shipping themselves. The houses arrived on a truck specially designed for the purpose by Lustron on which the parts were stored in the order they would be unloaded for assembly. A trained crew of workers could put one up within a week.|$|R

50|$|Towards {{the west}} of Garston is the main A41 trunk road from London which intersects St Albans Road at {{what is known as}} the Dome Roundabout. In 2016 this site is home to a Sainsbury's and an ASDA {{supermarket}} both with Petrol Stations, a Pizza Hut restaurant, numerous small shops within the Asda site, a take away and a Shell Petrol Station with a Waitrose shop inside. Previously this roundabout was home to the Bungalow Stores, an <b>independent</b> car <b>dealership,</b> gas holder and gas showroom, a Mobil petrol station and Odeon Motors, a circular car showroom overlooking the roundabout from that current Shell location.

40|$|Any {{decentralized}} retail or wholesale {{system of}} competing entities requires a benefit sharing arrangement when competing entities collaborate after their demands are realized. For instance, consider a distribution system {{similar to the}} observed behavior of <b>independent</b> car <b>dealerships.</b> If a dealership does not have in stock the car requested by a customer, it might consider acquiring it from a competing dealer. Such behavior raises questions about competitive procurement strategies that achieve system optimal outcomes. This dissertation consists of three main bodies of work contained respectively in chapters 2, 3, and 4. In the first work [...] chapter 2, we examine a decentralized system that adopts an ex-post agreed transfer payment approach proposed by Anupindi et al. (Manuf. Serv. Oper. Manag. 4 (3) : 349 - 368, 2001). In particular, we state a set of conditions on cost parameters and distributions that guarantee uniqueness of pure strategy Nash equilibrium. In the second work [...] chapter 3, we introduce a multilevel graph framework that links decentralized inventory distribution models as a network of stochastic programming with recourse problems. This framework depicts independent retailers who maximize their individual expected profits, with each retailer independently procuring inventory in the ex-ante stage in response to forecasted demand and anticipated cooperative recourse action of all retailers in the system. The graph framework clarifies the modeling connection between problems in a taxonomy of decentralized inventory distribution models. This unifying perspective links the past work and shades light on future research directions. In the last work [...] chapter 4, we examine and recast the biform games modeling framework as two-stage stochastic programming with recourse. Biform games modeling framework addresses two-stage games with competitive first stage and cooperative second stage without ex-ante agreement on profit sharing scheme. The two-stage stochastic programming view of biform games is demonstrated on examples from all the known examples regarding operational decision problems of competing firms from the literature. It allows an “old” mathematical methodology to showcase its versatility in modeling combined competitive and cooperative game options. In short, this dissertation provides important insights, clarifications, and strategic limitations regarding collaborations in decentralized distribution system...|$|R
