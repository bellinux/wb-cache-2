5|$|The three-cent nickel piece {{initially}} circulated well, {{but became}} less popular when the five-cent nickel {{was introduced in}} 1866, a larger, more convenient coin, with a value of five cents better fitting the decimal system. After 1870, most years saw low annual mintages for the three-cent nickel, and in 1890 Congress abolished it. The last were struck in 1889; many were melted down to coin more five-cent pieces.

25|$|Athens {{is built}} around a number of hills. Lycabettus {{is one of the}} tallest hills of the city proper and {{provides}} a view of the entire Attica Basin. The geomorphology of Athens is deemed {{to be one of the}} most complex in the world because its mountains cause a temperature inversion phenomenon which, along with the Greek Government's difficulties controlling industrial pollution, was responsible for the air pollution problems the city has faced. This <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> unique to Athens; for instance, Los Angeles and Mexico City also suffer from similar geomorphology inversion problems.|$|E

25|$|In March 1856 the Post Office {{issued the}} first postage stamp to feature Thomas Jefferson. The exact date of <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> clear. Scott Specialized Catalogue of United States Stamps and Covers {{establishes}} the release date {{with the first}} known use of this issue, March 24, 1856. The first issue of this stamp was in imperforate form, engraved and printed by Toppan, Carpenter, Casilear & Co. The Jefferson issue saw postal duty from the spring of 1856 to the summer of 1857. The engraving of Jefferson was modeled after {{a portrait of the}} President by Gilbert Stuart. By mid-1857 the stamps were issued with the top and bottom design projections omitted and with perforations. This printing was issued in at least six major color variations.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} trial, however, the <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> whether John {{tried to kill}} Monica but rather whether the officer's entry into the home was lawful. Here, the {{statement}} is not being offered to prove that John tried to kill Monica, but it instead is being offered {{to prove that the}} officer had probable cause to enter the home. Whether John was actually trying to kill Monica is irrelevant to the issue at hand; what matters is whether the officer believed that Monica was in danger and whether it had been necessary to kick down the door to investigate further. Monica's statement is evidence to that effect because a reasonable person, having heard Monica's cries for help, would fear for her safety.|$|E
25|$|Most {{scholars}} {{believe that}} Brahmi was likely derived from or {{influenced by a}} Semitic script model, with Aramaic being a leading candidate. However, the <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> settled {{due to the lack}} of direct evidence and unexplained differences between Aramaic, Kharoṣṭhī, and Brahmi. Virtually all authors accept that regardless of the origins, the degree of Indian development of the Brahmi script in both the graphic form and the structure has been extensive. It is also widely accepted that theories about the grammar of the Vedic language probably had a strong influence on this development. Some authors – both Western and Indian – suggest that Brahmi was borrowed or inspired by a Semitic script, invented in a short few years during the reign of Ashoka and then used widely for Ashokan inscriptions. In contrast, some authors reject the idea of foreign influence.|$|E

25|$|Though his {{paternal}} ancestors remained {{loyal to}} the Isabelinos, it was Enrique’s mother who influenced him towards Carlism, the leaning reinforced during the university years. According to himself always a Carlist, he joined the movement in 1869, the same year founding also the affiliated Juventud Catolica. As conde de Villalobos he unsuccessfully ran for the Cortes in 1871 from Ciudad Rodrigo, but obtained the mandate in the successive elections of 1872 from Ledesma. His service lasted only 2 months, since before the planned insurgency the claimant ordered his deputies to resign. There {{is no evidence that}} Enrique de Aguilera took part in the Third Carlist War and that he was exiled, though the <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> entirely clear. In 1876 in Paris, already as marqués, he was introduced to Carlos VII. The two developed cordial relationship bordering personal friendship; de Cerralbo turned out - along Solferino - one of two grandees who sided with Carlism and automatically became one of its most distinguished figures.|$|E
25|$|A French {{scientist}} {{notable for}} his anti-GM perspective, Gilles-Eric Seralini, {{raised concerns about}} some of the differences between feeding trials using the genetically modified and unmodified brinjal, and criticized some of the testing protocols. The EC-II responded to the concerns raised by Seralini and other scientists in their report, New Zealand epidemiologist Lou Gallagher also criticised the feeding trials saying that the raw data indicated toxic effects were associated with the rats fed Bt Brinjal. Concerns have also been raised about a possible conflict of interest, with some of the scientists appointed to the GEAC being involved in developing their own GM products, that the decision by the EC-II was not unanimous, and about the reliability of safety data originating from Mahcyo run trials. The imposed moratorium has been criticized by some scientists as not being based on any compelling scientific evidence and potentially setting Indian biotechnology back decades. Others feel the critical <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the safety of the GM technology, but its corporatization and there are claims that India’s crop protection industry was a major player in preventing the commercialization of the Bt brinjal. India's National Biodiversity Authority is probing the crop scientists involved in developing the Bt brinjal for allegedly violating India's Biological Diversity Act, 2002 by using local cultivars and foreign technology without their permission.|$|E

500|$|The {{traditional}} Taw Cheng Kong rational nexus test {{is inappropriate}} where the <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{the existence of}} discriminatory classification in a statute, but discriminatory application of a neutral statute. [...] This is because the statute would inevitably pass the test {{as the answer to}} whether the legislation in question differentiates between different classes of persons (stage 1 of the Taw Cheng Kong test) will always be in the negative. In Eng Foong Ho v. Attorney-General (2009), Judge of Appeal Andrew Phang, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, applied a modified form of the Taw Cheng Kong test, holding that [...] "he question is whether there is a reasonable nexus between the state action and the objective to be achieved by the law".|$|E
500|$|Other reviewers {{were more}} cautionary; the New York Times wrote that [...] "the {{aim of the}} filmmaker seems unclear, with Magdalena at first celebrated for her humanness and then exalted for her sudden saintliness" [...] and {{describing}} the story as [...] "wearyingly eventful". The Manila Bulletin noted that while the film is about belief (or lack thereof) in miracles, [...] "the effort to explore this <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> brought into fulfilling fruition. We keep on hoping something else more significant would happen later in the film to invoke the viewers own feelings about faith and an all-seeing, all-merciful God, but this never comes".

500|$|As {{described}} above, {{there are}} arguments about whether {{these and other}} early bands truly qualify as [...] "heavy metal" [...] or simply as [...] "hard rock". Those closer to the music's blues roots or placing greater emphasis on melody are now commonly ascribed the latter label. AC/DC, which debuted with High Voltage in 1975, is a prime example. The 1983 Rolling Stone encyclopedia entry begins, [...] "Australian heavy-metal band AC/DC". Rock historian Clinton Walker writes, [...] "Calling AC/DC a heavy metal band in the seventies was as inaccurate as it is today.... were a rock 'n' roll band that {{just happened to be}} heavy enough for metal". The <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> only one of shifting definitions, but also a persistent distinction between musical style and audience identification: Ian Christe describes how the band [...] "became the stepping-stone that led huge numbers of hard rock fans into heavy metal perdition".|$|E

[...] He was also critical of the Scientology organization leadership, including its head David Miscavige: [...] "I think that there are probably things of Scientology that are valuable and that can help people - my main <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> with Scientology per se, it is with Scientology the organization - it is a corrupt I believe and probably a criminal endeavor, and that has to do with people who are in charge of Scientology mainly David Miscavige..." ...|$|E

500|$|Defenders of {{the current}} usage often state their {{intention}} to honor Native Americans by referring to positive traits, such as fighting spirit and being aggressive, brave, stoic, dedicated, and proud; while opponents see these traits as being based upon stereotypes of Native Americans as savages. In general, the social sciences recognize that all stereotypes, whether positive or negative, are harmful because they promote false or misleading associations between a group and an attribute, fostering a disrespectful relationship. The injustice of such stereotypes is recognized with regard to other racial or ethnic groups, thus mascots are morally questionable regardless of offense being taken by individuals. Defenders {{of the status quo}} also state that the <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> important, being only about sports, and that the opposition is nothing more than [...] "political correctness", which change advocates argue ignores the extensive evidence of harmful effects of stereotypes and bias. Although there has been a steady {{decline in the number of}} teams doing so, Native American images and nicknames nevertheless remain fairly common in American and Canadian sports, and may be found in use at all levels, from youth teams to professional sports franchises.|$|E

500|$|On December 24, Khánh {{issued a}} {{declaration}} of independence from [...] "foreign manipulation", and condemned [...] "colonialism", explicitly accusing Taylor of abusing his power. At the time, Khánh was also secretly negotiating with the communists, hoping {{to put together a}} peace deal so he could expel the Americans from Vietnam, although this effort did not lead anywhere in the two months before he was forced out of power. For his part, Taylor privately told Americans journalists that Khánh was expressing opposition to the US merely because he knew he had lost Washington's confidence. Taylor said Khánh was completely unprincipled and was stirring up anti-American sentiment purely to try to shore up his political prospects, not because he thought US policy was harmful to South Vietnam. The US media were generally very critical of Khánh's actions and did not blame Taylor for the disharmony. Peter Grose of The New York Times said [...] "It almost seems as if Viet Cong insurgents and the Saigon government conspired to make the United States feel unwelcome." [...] The Chicago Tribune lampooned Khánh's junta, calling it a [...] "parody of a government" [...] and saying it would not survive for a week without US support and describing the generals as [...] "remittance men on the United States' payroll". However, the New York Herald Tribune said it was dangerous to pressure South Vietnam too much, citing the instability that followed the American support for the coup against Diệm, who had resisted US advice so often. It said [...] "The <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> General Khánh versus General Taylor. It is whether the Vietnamese still have the will to exist as an independent state."
