5|$|The scandal was {{followed}} by a number of attempts to adopt campaign finance reform—spearheaded by U.S. Sen. David Boren (D-OK)—but most attempts died in committee. A weakened reform was passed in 1993. Substantial campaign finance reform was not passed until the adoption of the McCain-Feingold Act in 2002. Bennett would later write that the Keating Five investigation <b>did</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> difference, as members of Congress were afterward far less likely to intercede with federal investigations on behalf of contributors.|$|E
5|$|Yamashiro was {{completed}} on 31 March 1917 and {{assigned to the}} 1st Division of the 1st Fleet in 1917–18, though she had no combat role in World War I. Like her sister, she patrolled {{off the coast of}} China during the war and assisted during the Great Kanto Earthquake. Little detailed information is available about her activities during the 1920s, although she <b>did</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> port visit to Port Arthur, China, on 5 April 1925 and also conducted training off the coast of China. Yamashiro became flagship of the Combined Fleet in 1935. In early 1941, the ship experimentally launched radio-controlled Kawanishi E7K2 floatplanes.|$|E

5|$|Gallaher {{retired from}} playing after the All Blacks' tour, but {{remained}} {{involved in the}} sport as a coach and selector. He coached at age group level for Ponsonby and in 1906 succeeded Fred Murray as sole selector of the Auckland provincial team. He was Auckland selector until 1916; over this time Auckland played 65 games, won 48, lost 11 and drew 6. Gallaher <b>did</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> brief comeback as a playertravelling as the selector of an injury depleted Auckland team, he turned out against Marlborough at Blenheim in 1909; Marlborough won 8–3. He also played against the Maniapoto sub-union just over a week later. Auckland held the Ranfurly Shield from 1905 to 1913, successfully defending it 23 times. The team struggled to retain the shield during 1912 and 1913 and eventually lost it to Taranaki in a 14–11 defeat. During Gallaher's tenure as selector Auckland inflicted a 11–0 defeat of the touring 1908 Anglo-Welsh side, defeated the New Zealand Māori in 1910, and beat Australia 15–11 in 1913.|$|E
5|$|Yamashiro, {{named for}} Yamashiro Province, the former {{province}} of Kyoto, was laid {{down at the}} Yokosuka Naval Arsenal on 20 November 1913 and launched on 3 November 1915. She was completed on 31 March 1917 with Captain Suketomo Nakajima in command, and {{was assigned to the}} 1st Division of the 1st Fleet in 1917–18. She did not take part in any combat during World War I, as there were no longer any forces of the Central Powers in East Asia {{by the time she was}} completed, but she did patrol off the coast of China briefly during the war. On 29 March 1922, a Gloster Sparrowhawk fighter successfully took off from the ship. She aided survivors of the 1923 Great Kantō earthquake, in September 1923. Little detailed information is available about Yamashiros activities during the 1920s, although she <b>did</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> port visit to Ryojun Guard District, in Manchuria, on 5 April 1925 and also conducted training off the coast of China.|$|E
5|$|Sussex {{began their}} run-chase well; Barclay and Gehan Mendis scored 93 runs together, {{surviving}} a spell of attacking fast bowling from Garner and Dredge early on. Mendis had broken his thumb {{shortly before the}} final, and in the third over, it was fractured again, but he continued to bat. When Somerset <b>did</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> breakthrough, after 24 overs, they collected four wickets for the addition of seventeen runs. Mendis was the first man out, caught by Marks off the bowling of Graham Burgess, followed by Barclay who was caught hooking a delivery from Botham. Miandad was dismissed without scoring, and shortly thereafter, Imran was caught and bowled by Botham for three. Rose then chose to replace his bowlers, and against the less incisive bowling of Keith Jennings and Burgess, Parker and Paul Phillipson were able to establish a 97-run partnership, which brought Sussex to within five runs of their winning target, before Phillipson was by caught by the wicket-keeper, Derek Taylor off the bowling of Dredge. Woodcock thought that Botham in particular bowled too short against Phillipson, who he suggested would have been susceptible to a yorker. In Wisden, Eric Hill opined that Botham's short-pitched bowling, which was a feature of his play late in the season, was due to him being overused by England and Somerset through the year. Parker scored the winning runs to secure a five-wicket victory for Sussex with 41 deliveries remaining.|$|E

25|$|Buffalo's miscue {{on their}} final drive was {{particularly}} noteworthy {{in that it}} came after they had called a timeout, making a subsequent delay of game penalty highly unusual.
