The existence of weeds significantly decreases rate of production and quality of herbage. Physically weed control by defoliation {{could be expected to}} sustain quality and production of herbage, and able to control weeds expansion. The aims of the study were to find the effect of interval defoliation of B. humidicola that was invaded by C. odorata and its effect on production, crude protein, phosphor, calcium contents of B. humidicola herbage, production and population dynamic of C. odorata. The treatments were nine different planting methods and different defoliation intervals, namely: B. humidicola was defoliated <b>every</b> 30 <b>days</b> without C. odorata (P 1); B. humidicola was defoliated <b>every</b> 60 <b>days</b> without C. odorata (P 2); B. humidicola was defoliated <b>every</b> 90 <b>days</b> without C. odorata (P 3); B. humidicola were defoliated <b>every</b> 30 <b>days,</b> C. odorata were not defoliated (P 4); B. humidicola were defoliated <b>every</b> 60 <b>days,</b> C. odorata were not defoliated (P 5); B. humidicola were defoliated <b>every</b> 30 <b>days,</b> C. odorata were not defoliated (P 6); B. humidicola and C. odorata were defoliated <b>every</b> 30 <b>days</b> (P 7); B. humidicola and C. odorata, were defoliated <b>every</b> 60 <b>days</b> (P 8); B. humidicola and C. odorata were defoliated <b>every</b> 90 <b>days</b> (P 9). Two experiment designs namely Completely Randomized Block Design and Split Plot Design in Time were used in the field experiments. The result of the experiments showed that dry matter production of B. humidicola which were defoliated <b>every</b> 90 <b>days</b> were not significantly different than those defoliated <b>every</b> 60 <b>days,</b> but it was significantly higher than those defoliated <b>every</b> 30 <b>days.</b> Crude protein, phosphor, and calcium content of herbage which were defoliated <b>every</b> 30 <b>days</b> were significantly higher than those defoliated <b>every</b> 60 <b>days</b> and 90 days.
