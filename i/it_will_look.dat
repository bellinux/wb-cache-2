5|$|Estimates of {{how long}} Surtsey will survive {{are based on the}} rate of erosion seen up to the present day. Assuming that the current rate does not change, the island will be mostly at or below sea level by 2100. However, the rate of erosion is likely to slow as the tougher core of the island is exposed: an {{assessment}} assuming that the rate of erosion will slow exponentially suggests that the island will survive for many centuries. An idea of what <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> like in the future is given by the other small islands in the Vestmannaeyjar archipelago, which formed {{in the same way as}} Surtsey several thousand years ago, and have eroded away substantially since they were formed.|$|E

On being {{inspired by the}} classic, Karan quoted, [...] "What appealed to me {{was the fact that}} the love story stretched out across generations. It began with youth and went on as the people grew older. You could say that Kabhi Kabhie is the starting point for my new film, that I am inspired by it. But the film, I am sure, will be very different. <b>It</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> different, feel different." [...] Similarly, Karan added an extra [...] "e" [...] to the second Kabhi in the title of his film, due to numerological reasons. In an interview with The Times of India, Karan dispelled comparisons with Kuch Kuch Hota Hai and said that while his debut film was [...] "frothy and bubble-gummish", this one was [...] "more classy and sophisticated". He added that there would be [...] "plenty of drama" [...] in this film too, but handled more maturely.|$|E

While filming a scene with Chris Hemsworth, who plays Thor, the film's director, Joss Whedon told the fighting duo that the scene did not look real enough, so Hiddleston told Hemsworth to really hit him for the fight scene. [...] "I said to Chris, 'Dude, just hit me. Just hit me because I'm protected here and it's fine.' He's like, 'Are you sure?' I was like, 'Yeah, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>look</b> great.

Jocelyn Herbert, famous designer of the British theatrical scene, comments that Harrison {{is aware of the}} dramatic visual impact of his ideas: [...] "The idea of satyrs jumping out of boxes in Trackers is wonderful for the stage.
