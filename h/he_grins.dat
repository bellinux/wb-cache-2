2500|$|As {{the music}} {{transitions}} from [...] "What I see" [...] to [...] "Behind the Barrier", Artemus is shown {{emerging from the}} cage section of [...] "The Healer" [...] ("Le Thérapeute", a figure appearing in many works by Belgian surrealist artist René Magritte, e.g., ref) He then finds himself in a surreal scene populated with what Lovece describes as [...] "ragged waifs" [...] crowded into the tall Barrier that encloses the Zone, with skeleton soldiers patrolling the ground. Artemus witnesses three identical girls emerging from a shell, one at a time, apparently having been cloned. He then sees himself emerging as a clone from a similar shell, and <b>he</b> <b>grins</b> at himself. (No such episode is described in the album's lyrics. This {{is one of several}} instances of artistic license employed by the video's director, Roger Lyons.) The video ends with Artemus shown content among the masses of [...] "ragged waifs" [...] gathered within the Barrier.|$|E

60|$|Spike looked {{somewhat}} embarrassed. <b>He</b> <b>grinned</b> apologetically, {{and shuffled}} his feet.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>grinned</b> vindictively, and the {{correspondent}} {{seemed to}} lose all interest.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>grinned,</b> {{and said}} that it was an {{establishment}} without dogs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Felix, [...] "he IS like a dog--very honest; <b>he</b> <b>grins</b> {{and runs}} about the city, {{and might be}} {{inclined}} to bay the moon." ...|$|E
6000|$|But now for authors nobler palms remain; Room for my lord! three jockeys in his train; Six huntsmen with a shout precede his chair: <b>He</b> <b>grins,</b> {{and looks}} broad {{nonsense}} with a stare. His honour's meaning Dulness thus express'd, 'He wins this patron, who can tickle best.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Vanine, {{that looked}} {{on all the}} danger past, [...] Because he 'scaped so long, is seized at last; [...] By p----, by hunger, and by Dryden bit, [...] <b>He</b> <b>grins</b> and snarls, and, in his dogged fit, [...] Froths at the mouth, a certain sign of wit." ...|$|E
60|$|The word {{seemed to}} {{electrify}} Svangvsk. <b>He</b> <b>grinned</b> wider than ever.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>grinned</b> at this pleasantry {{until his}} face {{looked like a}} cracked mask.|$|R
60|$|He did {{raise his}} face; his eyes lighted on the baby, and <b>he</b> <b>grinned.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 23. Oh! {{why is the}} Father of Hell in such glee, As <b>he</b> <b>grins</b> {{from ear}} to ear? Why does he doff his clothes joyfully, [...] 110 As he skips, and prances, and flaps his wing, As he sidles, leers, and twirls his sting, And dares, as he is, to appear? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't bother. When you're on the trail, you're {{occupied}} {{about the}} horses and how far you can go. Nothing else matters, and Jake, of course, never bothers at all. <b>He</b> <b>grins.</b> But I insisted on coming and when {{the man at the}} hotel wanted to buy you off I made you refuse. You know I did. You were hesitating." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "God's will be done!" [...] murmured {{the young}} man, {{as he walked}} sorrowfully away from the beach, {{entering}} again beneath the arches of the wood. [...] "God's will be done, on 'arth {{as it is in}} heaven! I did hope that my days would not be numbered so soon, but it matters little a'ter all. A few more winters, and a few more summers, and 'twould have been over, accordin' to natur'. Ah's! me, the young and actyve seldom think death possible, till <b>he</b> <b>grins</b> in their faces, and tells 'em the hour is come!" ...|$|E

60|$|Grin:--Your true diddler {{winds up}} {{all with a}} grin. But this nobody sees but himself. <b>He</b> <b>grins</b> when his daily work is done--when his allotted labors are accomplished--at night in his own closet, and {{altogether}} for his own private entertainment. He goes home. He locks his door. He divests himself of his clothes. He puts out his candle. He gets into bed. He places his head upon the pillow. All this done, and your diddler grins. This is no hypothesis. It {{is a matter of}} course. I reason a priori, and a diddle would be no diddle without a grin.|$|E
60|$|The {{photographs}} {{of him that}} present him from three to six show him developing into a round-eyed, flaxen-haired youngster with a truncated nose and a friendly stare. There lurks about his lips that never very remote promise of a smile that all the {{photographs of}} the early giant children display. In summer he wears loose garments of ticking tacked together with string; there is usually one of those straw baskets upon his head that workmen use for their tools, and he is barefooted. In one picture <b>he</b> <b>grins</b> broadly and holds a bitten melon in his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sady, come here! Confound you!" [...] shouts Master George. (Again the {{recording}} angel is in requisition, {{and has to}} be off on one of his endless errands to the register office.) [...] "Come directly, mas'r," [...] says Sady, and resumes his conversation with his woolly brethren. <b>He</b> <b>grins.</b> He takes the pistols out of the holster. He snaps the locks. He points them at a grunter, which plunges through the farmyard. He points down the road, over which he has just galloped, and towards which the woolly heads again turn. He says again, [...] "Comin', mas'r. Everybody a-comin'." [...] And now, the gallop of other horses is heard. And who is yonder? Little Mr. Dempster, spurring and digging into his pony; and that lady in a riding-habit on Madam Esmond's little horse, can it be Madam Esmond? No. It is too stout. As I live it is Mrs. Mountain on Madam's grey! ...|$|E
60|$|Fresno {{stared at}} her. <b>He</b> <b>grinned.</b> The idea evidently {{surprised}} and flattered him; {{yet it was}} perplexing.|$|R
60|$|Twiddling a small object, a door-key of {{peculiar}} make, in his hand, <b>he</b> <b>grinned</b> stolidly at me.|$|R
60|$|A broad grin spread itself {{across the}} other's face. There was {{something}} singularly engaging about him when <b>he</b> <b>grinned.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Time for rain! {{for your}} long hot dry Autumn [...] Had net-worked with brown [...] The white skin of each grape on the bunches, [...] Marked like a quail's crown, [...] Those creatures you make such account of, [...] Whose heads--speckled white [...] Over brown {{like a great}} spider's back, [...] As I told you last night-- [...] 20 [...] Your mother bites off for her supper. [...] Red-ripe as could be, [...] Pomegranates were chapping and {{splitting}} [...] In halves on the tree: [...] And betwixt the loose walls of great flintstone, [...] Or in the thick dust [...] On the path, or {{straight out of the}} rockside, [...] Wherever could thrust [...] Some burnt sprig of bold hardy rock-flower [...] Its yellow face up, [...] 30 [...] For the prize were great butterflies fighting, [...] Some five for one cup. [...] So, I guessed, ere I got up this morning, [...] What change was in store, [...] By the quick rustle-down of the quail-nets [...] Which woke me before [...] I could open my shutter, made fast [...] With a bough and a stone, [...] And look thro' the twisted dead vine-twigs, [...] Sole lattice that's known. [...] 40 [...] Quick and sharp rang the rings down the net-poles, [...] While, busy beneath, [...] Your priest and his brother tugged at them, [...] The rain in their teeth. [...] And out upon all the flat house-roofs [...] Where split figs lay drying, [...] The girls took the frails under cover: [...] Nor use seemed in trying [...] To get out the boats and go fishing, [...] For, under the cliff, [...] 50 [...] Fierce the black water frothed o'er the blind-rock. [...] No seeing our skiff [...] Arrive about noon from Amalfi, [...] --Our fisher arrive, [...] And pitch down his basket before us, [...] All trembling alive [...] With pink and grey jellies, your sea-fruit; [...] You touch the strange lumps, [...] And mouths gape there, eyes open, all manner [...] Of horns and of humps, [...] 60 [...] Which only the fisher looks grave at, [...] While round him like imps [...] Cling screaming the children as naked [...] And brown as his shrimps; [...] Himself too as bare to the middle [...] --You see round his neck [...] The string and its brass coin suspended, [...] That saves him from wreck. [...] But to-day not a boat reached Salerno, [...] So back, to a man, [...] 70 [...] Came our friends, with whose help in the vineyards [...] Grape-harvest began. [...] In the vat, halfway up in our houseside, [...] Like blood the juice spins, [...] While your brother all bare-legged is dancing [...] Till breathless <b>he</b> <b>grins</b> [...] Dead-beaten in effort on effort [...] To keep the grapes under, [...] Since still when he seems all but master, [...] In pours the fresh plunder [...] 80 [...] From girls who keep coming and going [...] With basket on shoulder, [...] And eyes shut against the rain's driving; [...] Your girls that are older,-- [...] For under the hedges of aloe, [...] And where, on its bed [...] Of the orchard's black mould, the love-apple [...] Lies pulpy and red, [...] All the young ones are kneeling and filling [...] Their laps with the snails [...] 90 [...] Tempted out by this first rainy weather,-- [...] Your best of regales, [...] As to-night will be proved to my sorrow, [...] When, supping in state, [...] We shall feast our grape-gleaners (two dozen, [...] Three over one plate) [...] With lasagne so tempting to swallow, [...] In slippery ropes, [...] And gourds fried in great purple slices, [...] That colour of popes. [...] 100 [...] Meantime, see the grape bunch they've brought you: [...] The rain-water slips [...] O'er the heavy blue bloom on each globe [...] Which the wasp to your lips [...] Still follows with fretful persistence: [...] Nay, taste, while awake, [...] This half of a curd-white smooth cheese-ball [...] That peels, flake by flake, [...] Like an onion, each smoother and whiter; [...] Next, sip this weak wine [...] 110 [...] From the thin green glass flask, with its stopper, [...] A leaf of the vine; [...] And end with the prickly-pear's red flesh [...] That leaves thro' its juice [...] The stony black seeds on your pearl-teeth. [...] Scirocco is loose! [...] Hark, the quick, whistling pelt of the olives [...] Which, thick in one's track, [...] Tempt the stranger to pick up and bite them, [...] Tho' not yet half black! [...] 120 [...] How the old twisted olive trunks shudder, [...] The medlars let fall [...] Their hard fruit, and the brittle great fig-trees [...] Snap off, figs and all, [...] For here comes the whole of the tempest! [...] No refuge, but creep [...] Back again to my side and my shoulder, [...] And listen or sleep. [...] O how will your country show next week, [...] When all the vine-boughs [...] 130 [...] Have been stripped of their foliage to pasture [...] The mules and the cows? [...] Last eve, I rode over the mountains, [...] Your brother, my guide, [...] Soon left me, to feast on the myrtles [...] That offered, each side, [...] Their fruit-balls, black, glossy and luscious,-- [...] Or strip from the sorbs [...] A treasure, or, rosy and wondrous, [...] Those hairy gold orbs! [...] 140 [...] But my mule picked his sure sober path out, [...] Just stopping to neigh [...] When he recognized down in the valley [...] His mates on their way [...] With the faggots and barrels of water; [...] And soon we emerged [...] From the plain, where the woods could scarce follow; [...] And still as we urged [...] Our way, the woods wondered, and left us, [...] As up still we trudged [...] 150 [...] Though the wild path grew wilder each instant, [...] And place was e'en grudged [...] 'Mid the rock-chasms and piles of loose stones [...] Like the loose broken teeth [...] Of some monster which climbed there to die [...] From the ocean beneath-- [...] Place was grudged to the silver-grey fume-weed [...] That clung to the path, [...] And dark rosemary ever a-dying [...] That, 'spite the wind's wrath, [...] 160 [...] So loves the salt rock's face to seaward, [...] And lentisks as staunch [...] To the stone where they root and bear berries, [...] And... what shows a branch [...] Coral-coloured, transparent, with circlets [...] Of pale seagreen leaves; [...] Over all trod my mule with the caution [...] Of gleaners o'er sheaves, [...] Still, foot after foot like a lad [...] Till, round after round, [...] 170 [...] He {{climbed to the top of}} Calvano, [...] And God's own profound [...] Was above me, and round me the mountains, [...] And under, the sea, [...] And within me my heart to bear witness [...] What was and shall be.|$|E

5000|$|Its first {{appearance}} in literature was in the 18th century. A classical dictionary of the vulgar tongue (1788) by Francis Grose (The Second Edition, Corrected and Enlarged, London) contains the following entry: [...] "CHESHIRE CAT. <b>He</b> <b>grins</b> like a Cheshire cat; said of any one who shows his teeth and gums in laughing." ...|$|E

50|$|David is {{dreaming about}} the night that he murdered his wife and her lover, in which <b>he</b> <b>grins</b> an insane smile, one which resembles the monster Grice's.
