For residential equipment, SEER reflects {{performance at}} moderate temperatures, and is largely independent of high temperature efficiency and high latent heat removal capability. The test procedure gives too little credit for advanced air handlers that reduce air conditioning load and facilitate adaptive humidity control through automatic fan speed adjustment. DC permanent magnet variable speed motors have much lower market share than less efficient {{permanent split capacitor}} designs: changing saves 15 % - 25 % at high fan speed, and at least 50 % at lower speeds (high latent cooling). <b>Humidistats</b> allow dynamic humidity control by reducing air flow, cooling the evaporator.

40|$|Two summer {{outbreaks}} of humidifier fever (HF) {{are described in}} a microprocessor factory (factory A) and a printing factory (factory B). The air in each factory was humidified intermittently and controlled by present <b>humidistats</b> operating to maintain a relative humidity of 45 % by an air handler incorporating a spray humidifier in factory A and two ceiling mounted spray humidifiers in factory B. Questionnaire data from each workforce suggested that although symptoms apparently occurred most commonly in both factories on return from holiday (41 / 57, 71. 9 %), many subjects (24 / 40, 60 %) in factory A also had intermittent symptoms of ill defined periodicity for some time before the disorder was recognised. Similar intermittent symptoms with no discernible pattern occurred in factory B in {{a smaller number of}} subjects (4 / 17, 23. 5 %), all of whom were night or rotating shift workers. Both episodes of humidifier fever after return from summer holiday developed when nocturnal air temperatures were unseasonably low; not on the day of return to work but two days later (factory A) and one day later (factory B). Symptoms were most common in most workers who had circulating serum IgG antibody measured by ELISA to humidifier sludge in factory B (14 / 17, 82. 9 %) but were most common in IgG antibody negative subjects in factory A (27 / 40, 67. 5 %). A more classic form of humidifier fever redeveloped in factory B during winter when meteorological recordings suggested that humidification of intake air was more continuous. Humidifier fever in winter may have been the major influence on the formulation of the symptom pattern thought to be relevant for recognition of the disorder. A form of the illness, however, can occur during the summer which is camouflaged by intermittent humidification when the symptoms appear to be more closely associated with cool nocturnal air intake and unrelated to the pattern of attendance at work...|$|R

40|$|Thermally Activated Building Systems (TABS) is a {{recognized}} low-energy HVAC system. Sizing {{of these systems}} is complex due to their slow thermal response. Limited cooling capacity of these systems and inadequacy of conventional sizing method, that assumes high factor of safety, is preventing early adoption of these systems. TABS, however, is proven to be energy-efficient and capable of preserving comfort in several commercial buildings of Europe. There is, however no comprehensive case study report on comfort performance of TABS in the US. With this being the background, my dissertation aims to identify and recommend a design method for TABS that balances between accuracy of multivariable complex design models, high computational cost of models requiring an iterative approach and computational ease of simple single to bivariate linear design models. The dissertation work involved: 1) a systematic qualitative review of seven TABS design models from the literature, and 2) a simulation based quantitative comfort performance assessment of three shortlisted design models. I reviewed seven design and control models and characterized them systematically with an aim to investigate their applicability in various design scenarios and at different design stages. All of these models size water supply temperature (WST) as this parameter {{will be used for}} selection and sizing of the cooling plant or the condenser unit. The design scenarios include variable internal heat gain, different building thermal mass, varying pump operating hours and varying solar gain due to orientation. Other parameters affecting cooling load and thermal performance of TABS that were held constant in this study included window-to-wall area ratio, zone volume, construction insulation, supply air temperature and volume flow rate of the ventilation system, external shading, location, TABS mass flow rate, pipe layout, active surface configuration and TABS thermal properties. I considered three design stages: feasibility study, early design decisions, and detailed design sizing and the selection criteria are reliability and ease of implementation. Results of the qualitative analysis indicated that based on the above-mentioned criteria, a hybrid model recommended by ISO 11855 is the best candidate for detailed design and sizing of the cooling plant. An outdoor temperature (Toa) compensated model, a zone operative temperature (OT) feedback based model and the hybrid model from ISO 11855 were isolated for transient simulation based quantitative evaluation in terms of a novel comfort exceedance metric. This metric accounts for both duration and severity of discomfort and is weighted by instantaneous occupancy. For comfort analysis in terms of zone OT, zone RH was maintained using <b>humidistats.</b> TABS was the only cooling system in the building. Twelve simulations were carried out in a standard 5 zone small office building for CZ 03 in EnergyPlus v 7. 0 under 2 different heat gains and 2 construction types.  Results of the simulation study indicated that both the Toa compensated model and zone operative temperature feedback based model provided equally good comfort in 14 out of 20 design scenarios including zone orientation. However, the zone OT feedback model responded better to the heat gain and thermal mass conditions as expected, and is therefore recommended as a more robust model for early and detailed design phase implementation.  The hybrid model recommended by ISO 11855 resulted in comfort exceedance of 10 % to 48 %, while the recommended threshold exceedance for this study was 3 - 5 %. This model also resulted in significantly reduced discomfort using 24 hours hydronic cooling energy of TABS instead of the design day 24 hours cooling energy of convective system...|$|R

50|$|In-storage drying methods {{refers to}} those grain is dried {{and stored in}} the same container. Low-temperature drying, also known as near-ambient drying, is one of in-storage drying methods. There are four major factors which {{influence}} low temperature drying: the variability of weather, the harvest moisture content, the air flow in the storage bin {{and the amount of}} heated air. Most low-temperature dryers are built to dry grain as slowly as possible, while in the same time less spoilage on the grain. It is suggested that low temperature drying system is better operated when the average daily temperature is between 30 °C and 50 °C. Rather than control the drying air temperature, the low-temperature drying focuses on the relative humidity in order to achieve equilibrium moisture content (EMC) in all grain layers. Low-temperature drying process usually takes 5 days to several months depends on several important variables: weather, airflow, initial moisture content and amount of heat used. Among which, airflow is the key factor. Without appropriate airflow rate, spoilage will occur before drying is completed. By using heated air (LP heat, electric heat and solar heat), the relative humidity of the drying air is better controlled to achieve the desired moisture content. Usually, heated air dryer is used when the relative humidity larger than 70%. In electric heat dryers, an electrical resistant heater is usually placed before the fan to heat the airstream. In some case, a <b>humidistat</b> is employed to control the heater. In solar heat dryers, the drying air passes through the solar collector first to be heated (usually 10 to 12 °F rise), then enters the bin through the fan and motor. The advantages of in-storage low temperature drying are quick filling, high quality product, less equipment requirement; while the disadvantages are long drying time, electrical demand if using electric heat, high management skills and uncertain harvest moisture content.|$|E
40|$|In a hot {{and humid}} climate such as Florida, ?snowbirds? that leave their homes for {{extended}} summer periods need guidance on effective and energy efficient methods of humidity control. Experiments were performed in seven residences to evaluate various approaches to humidity control, including providing no mechanical system control. A humidity target was identified to maintain indoor relative humidity (RH) at 65 % or lower most of the time. Providing no mechanical conditioning (letting the building ?float?) yields relative humidity at 65 % or below during hot and sunny weather in some homes, but not during cloudy weather. Setting the AC system thermostat at 85 ?F or 83 ?F yielded lower than required RH during hot and sunny weather, but it yielded insufficient RH control during cloudy weather. Furthermore, AC energy use peaks during the utility?s peak demand period. Running the AC system for {{two hours a day}} (3 - 5 AM) yielded effective and energy efficient RH control. Operation of a dehumidifier on timer control or <b>humidistat</b> control provided good results with the lowest overall energy use. Operation of the space heating system to maintain 89 ?F (which yields 65 % RH when the outdoor dew point temperature is 75 ?F) provides reliable RH control, with good energy efficiency during hot weather (assuming a heat pump as the heating system). However, during cooler weather, the space heating approach consumed considerably more energy. Operation of the space heating system based on <b>humidistat</b> control provides reliable RH control and eliminates the excessive energy use which occurs during cooler weather with the constant 89 ?F setting...|$|E
40|$|Many {{manufactured}} {{homes have}} lower natural ventila tion rates {{than those in}} site-built houses. This, combined with high occupancy levels, may lead to moisture problems, which can cause structural damage and health problems. The objectives {{of this study were}} to (1) obtain information on the moisture behavior of manufactured houses and moisture release from occupants and other sources and (2) evaluate the effect of mechanical ventilation. We measured the ventilation and indoor humidity in six manufactured houses during winter. The measurements indicate that ventilation in manufactured homes is often less than recom mended. Using a mathematical model, the average moisture release and moisture storage rates were determined and the effect of mechanical ventilation with controls on humidity and comfort, condensation, and energy consumption during winter was analyzed. Results show that the average mois ture release is similar to documented rates and that manu factured houses appear to store less moisture than site-built houses. However. moisture storage in manufactured houses is enough to reduce the potential for condensation during winter. To prevent significant condensation, natural ventila tion is usually sufficient and mechanical ventilation is needed only in we of high occupancy and moisture loads or in an airtight house with negligible natural ventilation. ASHRAE’s minimum ventilation requirements usually exceed the level needed to prevent condensation. and in cold winter climates. these minimum ventilation levels without humidifi cation will cause the indoor air to be uncomfortably dry. To improve ventilation, manufactured houses should be supplied with balanced mechanical ventilation with an automatic control and manual override. In the absence of a better inexpensive alternative, a <b>humidistat</b> control may be used during winter lo prevent condensation without exces sive heat or comfort loss. However, a <b>humidistat</b> control does not ensure that ASHRAE minimum ventilation levels will be achieved...|$|E

40|$|For the {{conservation}} of an important museum collection in a historic building a better controlled indoor climate may be necessary. One {{of the most important}} factors is controlling relative humidity. Museum collections often are part of the interior of a historic building. In most cases the installation of an expensive airconditioning system may cause damage to the building and its historic authenticity. Furthermore humidifying may lead to dramatic indoor air conditions with mould and condensation effects on the cold indoor surfaces or even internal condensation in the construction. One way to overcome this problem is to make use of so-called ‘conservation heating’. A <b>humidistat</b> to limit relative humidity controls the heating system. Conservation heating control was tested in an experimental set-up in the laboratory and experience was gained in a historic building in the Netherlands. Control strategies and regimes were tested both by experiment and by simulation. The simulation model is validated by measurements. In the historic building the indoor climate was monitored during a long period. The preservation conditions of the indoor climate on the collection and the monumental building were evaluated. The indoor climate for preservation of a monumental building and its monumental interior may be improved by conservation heating. The human comfort however may decline. Furthermore it is a simple and energy efficient system which requires low maintenance...|$|E
40|$|A {{biosphere}} model {{based on}} the Biosphere-Atmosphere Transfer Scheme (BATS) and the Saltzman-Vernekar (SV) statistical-dynamical climate model is developed. Some equations of BATS are adopted either intact or with modifications, some are conceptually modified, and still others are replaced with equations of the SV model. The model is designed {{so that it can}} be run independently as long as the parameters related to the physiology and physiognomy of the vegetation, the atmospheric conditions, solar radiation, and soil conditions are given. With this stand-alone biosphere model, a series of sensitivity investigations, particularly the model sensitivity to fractional area of vegetation cover, soil surface water availability, and solar radiation for different types of vegetation, were conducted as a first step. These numerical experiments indicate that the presence of a vegetation cover greatly enhances the exchanges of momentum, water vapor, and energy between the atmosphere and the surface of the earth. An interesting result is that a dense and thick vegetation cover tends to serve as an environment conditioner or, more specifically, a thermostat and a <b>humidistat,</b> since the soil surface temperature, foliage temperature, and temperature and vapor pressure of air within the foliage are practically insensitive to variation of soil surface water availability and even solar radiation within a wide range. An attempt is also made to simulate the gradual deterioration of environment accompanying gradual degradation of a tropical forest to grasslands. Comparison with field data shows that this model can realistically simulate the land surface processes involving biospheric variations...|$|E
40|$|In most applications, heating, ventilating, and air {{conditioning}} (HVAC) equipment is controlled to maintain an indoor dry-bulb set point temperature. Moisture removal by the HVAC system {{is considered to be}} an operational byproduct. During summer months, the operation of the HVAC system is usually sufficient to meet both the sensible and latent cooling loads. However, during other times of the year when sensible loads are reduced, the moisture load can be significantly higher than the available moisture removal capacity of the {{air conditioning}} system. This can lead to elevated indoor relative humidity levels and an uncomfortable indoor environment. In many cases, designers, engineers and building occupants combat high indoor relative humidity and associated comfort problems with the use of additional dehumidification equipment for both commercial and residential applications. The use of extra dehumidification equipment can be expensive in terms of first cost and annual operating costs. First costs associated with this type of equipment may include additional electrical circuits, condensate drainage, and additional air distribution systems. The loss of usable floor area, localized noise, and zonal ?hotspots? can also be considered a cost penalty. As an alternative to using separate equipment for meeting both the sensible and latent components of a building?s cooling load, off-the- shelf products were used to construct a self-contained air handler. The air handler is controlled using a low-cost thermostat and <b>humidistat.</b> The dehumidification element of the system is completely independent from the air conditioner and works nearly the same as conventional dehumidification equipment. At times, both the dehumidification equipment and the air conditioner operate in unison when the need arises. The use of dehumidification equipment integrated with a conventional AC system provides a unique solution for moisture control applications. This paper describes the development and testing of this integrated equipment. Although this technology is not new, the integration of a dehumidification system with a standard air conditioner is an innovative strategy {{that can be used to}} address moisture control in buildings. This new HVAC configuration would provide a low-cost solution for building owners and a more comfortable indoor environment for building occupants...|$|E
