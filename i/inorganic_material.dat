5|$|Several egg {{clutches}} of C. dughii are known, containing {{as many as}} 25 fossilized eggs. Unfortunately, taphonomical alterations (changes during the fossilization process) {{make it difficult to}} determine the original structure of the nest. Cousin (2002) hypothesized that Cairanoolithus eggs were laid {{on the surface of the}} ground, possibly buried beneath a mound of plant matter. Tanaka et al. (2015) noted that the shell had a high rate of water vapor conductance. Therefore, they concluded that Cairanoolithus nests were covered by organic or <b>inorganic</b> <b>material,</b> similar to modern eggs with high vapor conductance.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted hyena}} is very {{efficient}} at eating its prey; {{not only is}} it able to splinter and eat the largest ungulate bones, it is also able to digest them completely. Spotted hyenas can digest all organic components in bones, not just the marrow. Any <b>inorganic</b> <b>material</b> is excreted with the faeces, which consist almost entirely of a white powder with few hairs. They react to alighting vultures more readily than other African carnivores, {{and are more likely to}} stay in the vicinity of lion kills or human settlements.|$|E
5|$|Cementum is a {{specialized}} bone like substance covering {{the root of}} a tooth. It is approximately 45% <b>inorganic</b> <b>material</b> (mainly hydroxyapatite), 33% organic material (mainly collagen) and 22% water. Cementum is excreted by cementoblasts within {{the root of the}} tooth and is thickest at the root apex. Its coloration is yellowish and it is softer than dentin and enamel. The principal role of cementum is to serve as a medium by which the periodontal ligaments can attach to the tooth for stability. At the cementoenamel junction, the cementum is acellular due to its lack of cellular components, and this acellular type covers at least ⅔ of the root. The more permeable form of cementum, cellular cementum, covers about ⅓ of the root apex.|$|E

5|$|Connective tissues are fibrous {{and made}} up of cells {{scattered}} among <b>inorganic</b> <b>material</b> called the extracellular matrix. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. The main types are loose connective tissue, adipose tissue, fibrous connective tissue, cartilage and bone. The extracellular matrix contains proteins, the chief and most abundant of which is collagen. Collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues. The matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body. An exoskeleton is a thickened, rigid cuticle which is stiffened by mineralization, as in crustaceans or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in insects. An endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed animals, {{as well as in}} many of those less developed.|$|E
25|$|In {{this early}} stage of {{hydrogen}} stable isotope study, most isotope compositions or fractionations were reported as bulk measurements of all organic material or all <b>inorganic</b> <b>material.</b> Some exceptions include cellulose and methane, as these compounds are easily separated. Another advantage of methane for compound specific measurements {{is the lack of}} hydrogen exchange. Cellulose has exchangeable hydrogen, but chemical derivatization can prevent swapping of cellulose hydrogen with water or mineral hydrogen sources. Cellulose and methane studies in the 1970s and 1980s set the standard for modern hydrogen isotope geochemistry.|$|E
25|$|Under ISO 3632, {{determination}} of non-stigma content ("floral waste content") and other extraneous matter such as <b>inorganic</b> <b>material</b> ("ash") are also key.

ISO 3632 deals exclusively with saffron and establishes three categories: III (poorest quality), II, and I (finest quality). Formerly there was also category IV, which was below category III. Samples are assigned categories by gauging the spice's crocin and picrocrocin content, revealed by measurements of specific spectrophotometric absorbance. Safranal is treated slightly differently and rather than there being threshold levels for each category, samples must give a reading of 20–50 for all categories.|$|E

25|$|The mythological {{name was}} revived in 1979 by James Lovelock, in Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth; his Gaia {{hypothesis}} {{was supported by}} Lynn Margulis. The hypothesis proposes that living organisms and <b>inorganic</b> <b>material</b> {{are part of a}} dynamical system that shapes the Earth's biosphere, and maintains the Earth as a fit environment for life. In some Gaia theory approaches, the Earth itself is viewed as an organism with self-regulatory functions. Further books by Lovelock and others popularized the Gaia Hypothesis, which was embraced to some extent by New Age environmentalists as part of the heightened awareness of environmental concerns of the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Vitalism is {{the belief}} that the life-principle is non-material. This {{originated}} with Georg Ernst Stahl (17th century), and remained popular until the middle of the 19th century. It appealed to philosophers such as Henri Bergson, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Wilhelm Dilthey, anatomists like Marie François Xavier Bichat, and chemists like Justus von Liebig. Vitalism included the idea that there was a fundamental difference between organic and <b>inorganic</b> <b>material,</b> and the belief that organic material can only be derived from living things. This was disproved in 1828, when Friedrich Wöhler prepared urea from inorganic materials. This Wöhler synthesis is considered the starting point of modern organic chemistry. It is of historical significance because for the first time an organic compound was produced in inorganic reactions.|$|E

40|$|Materials with {{exceptional}} nonlinear {{optical properties}} {{are critical to}} the continuing development of photonic and electro-optical devices, such as those used in optical communications, networking, optical computation for signal processing and data storage equipments. Currently, there exists {{a wide range of}} <b>inorganic</b> non-linear optical <b>materials</b> with varied wavelengths, damage thresholds and optical characteristics. Most technologies are based on <b>inorganic</b> <b>materials</b> with the appropriate optical properties. Using <b>inorganic</b> <b>materials</b> has some major drawbacks. Primarily, <b>inorganic</b> <b>materials</b> used in optical systems are difficult and expensive to process. In addition, <b>inorganic</b> <b>materials</b> have a high dielectric constant, requiring larger poling voltages and often suffering from changes in the material’s refractive index. Finally, <b>inorganic</b> <b>materials</b> have a low electro-optic coefficient, which is less suitable for electro-optic modulation. The present best practice in Photonics technology is the usage of organic materials/dyes that exhibit exceptional nonlinear optical properties. These organic materials/dyes are easy to prepare in solution or solid form. The resulting organic material has a low dielectric constant, eliminating the need for poling while maintaining the refractive index. However, these organic materials have few of the drawbacks inherent in the processing of comparable <b>inorganic</b> <b>materials</b> like of intense light induced degradation or bleaching and aggregation at higher dye concentration. In order to overcome these drawbacks and for effective use of highly nonlinear dyes, the strategic idea for the next practice is doping the dye molecules in polymer matrix. This idea of dye-doped polymer material matrix may increase the concentration of absorptive or fluorescence centers as well as the opto-chemical and opto-physical stability. In this paper we have discussed the strategic advantages of dye-doped polymer nonlinear materials in comparison with organic and <b>inorganic</b> nonlinear <b>materials</b> for future photonics technology by considering an example of an organic dye 4 -[4 -(Dimethylamino) styryl]- 1 - docosyl pyridinium bromide, doped in a polymer matrix Polymethyl methacrylate methacrylic acid (PMMA-MA) ...|$|R

[...] The inhabitants hoped eventually to create a complex ecology; all human-settled planets in the Galaxy [...] except Earth [...] had simple ecologies. [...] The inhabitants of Gaia were all tied together into a telepathic group consciousness when it was founded; this consciousness was eventually extended to the non-human life, and later to the <b>inorganic</b> <b>material</b> of the planet.

50|$|Another type of {{contamination}} in UPW is dissolved <b>inorganic</b> <b>material,</b> primarily silica. Silica {{is one of}} the most abundant mineral on the planet and is found in all water supplies. Any dissolved <b>inorganic</b> <b>material</b> has the potential to remain on the wafer as the UPW dries. Once again this can lead to a significant loss in yield. To detect trace amounts of dissolved <b>inorganic</b> <b>material</b> a measurement of non-volatile residue is commonly used. This technique involves using a nebulizer to create droplets of UPW suspended in a stream of air. These droplets are dried at a high temperature to produce an aerosol of non-volatile residue particles.
