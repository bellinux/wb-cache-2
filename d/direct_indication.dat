5|$|This led to Hanbury Brown's {{work on the}} Mark IVA, which {{differed}} from the Mk. IV primarily by having an additional display unit {{in front of the}} pilot. The radar operator had an additional control, the strobe, which could be adjusted to pick out returns at a particular range. Only those returns were sent to the pilot's display, resulting in much less clutter. Unlike the operator's display, the pilot's showed the target's location as a single dot in a bore-scope like fashion; if the dot was above and {{to the right of the}} centre of the display, the pilot had to turn to the right and climb to intercept. The result was what was known as a flying spot indicator, a single selected target showing a <b>direct</b> <b>indication</b> of the target's relative position.|$|E

Following the expulsion of Jews from Judea after 135 CE, Tiberias and its neighbor Sepphoris (Hebrew name: Tzippori) became the major Jewish cultural centres, competing within the Jewish world for status and recognition with Babylon, Alexandria, Aleppo and the Persian Empire.|$|E
25|$|The Buddy-Watcher is a wrist mounted buddy alert device which sends an {{ultrasonic}} signal when a key is pressed, for {{at least}} 20m through the water to the matching unit on the dive buddy, which will produce a silent vibratory and visual signal alerting the diver that their buddy wants attention. There is no <b>direct</b> <b>indication</b> to the sender whether the signal has been received and no indication of distance or direction to the buddy. The device is waterproof to 40m, therefore is suited for recreational scuba diving use, but not technical diving.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to determine which information cues related to quality and origin really attract consumer interest, specified as the level of attention paid to and perceived importance attached to label cues. The focus is (1) on indications of quality through quality marks, (2) on indications referring to the mandatory European beef labelling regulation, and (3) on indications reflecting origin. Data are collected from a sample of 278 beef consumers in Belgium. Ordered probit models are specified and estimated to assess the impact of household characteristics and a beef labeling information campaign. Findings reveal that consumer interest is generally low for traceability, moderate for origin and high for <b>direct</b> <b>indications</b> of quality. Interest in label cues is specifically low among younger males. Further, the publicity campaign had a measurable positive impact on consumer's attention to <b>direct</b> <b>indications</b> of quality and origin. Strategies including traceability for backing up on-label indications of quality are recommended. Agribusiness,...|$|R
25|$|In contrast, the spiral-can {{system was}} {{essentially}} a rotating version of a conventional A-scope display. In the A-scope, a time base generator pulls the CRT beam across the screen horizontally, and blips indicate the range to the target along the line the radar is currently pointed. For spiral-scan the only difference was that the line was no longer always horizontal, but was rotating around {{the face of the}} display at the same speed as the dish. Blips on the screen now indicated two values, the angle of the target relative to the centreline, and the range to the target represented by the distance from the centre. What was lost in this display was a <b>direct</b> <b>indication</b> of magnitude of the angle from the centre; a blip to the upper right indicated the target was in that direction but did not directly indicate if it was five, ten or twenty degrees off.|$|E

500|$|The {{black-and-white}} {{stripes on}} the prisoner's uniform {{in the first}} design reminded Fuse of the Forty-seven Ronin, who wore black and white; this led him to incorporate traditional Japanese clothing into the design. He called this the key to solving the problem, but still had further issues with the design: if he made the outfit too Japanese, Blackquill would not look like an Ace Attorney prosecutor, and {{he thought it would}} be strange if he gave him a katana like an actual ronin, since Blackquill is a convict, and even average citizens are not legally allowed to carry swords. He realized that he could use a combination of Japanese black-and-white clothes and prosecutorial Western clothes found in the Meiji era, when Japan was Westernized. As they needed the character to look [...] "sharp and stylish in Western clothing", the only <b>direct</b> <b>indication</b> of him being a convict in the end was his shackles. His messy ponytail was also used to convey a feeling of [...] "long incarceration", as well as evoke the image of a ronin. Blackquill's hawk, Taka, was initially just meant as a part of the Japanese elements of the design, being reminiscent of Japanese falconers. Taka's role was eventually extended to bringing documents and evidence to Blackquill, highlighting how Blackquill's movements are hindered by his shackles. Fuse described the final design as looking like a [...] "Meiji Restoration-era fighter".|$|E
500|$|Compounds {{containing}} {{one or more}} elements {{which can}} exist {{in a variety of}} charge/oxidation states will have a stoichiometry that depends on which oxidation states are present, to ensure overall neutrality. This can be indicated in the name by specifying either the oxidation state of the elements present, or the charge on the ions. Because of the risk of ambiguity in allocating oxidation states, IUPAC prefers <b>direct</b> <b>indication</b> of the ionic charge numbers. These are written as an arabic integer followed by the sign (..., 2−, 1−, 1+, 2+,...) in parentheses directly after the name of the cation (without a space separating them). For example, FeSO4 is named iron(2+) sulfate (with the 2+ charge on the Fe2+ ions balancing the 2− charge on the sulfate ion), whereas Fe2(SO4)3 is named iron(3+) sulfate (because the two iron ions in each formula unit each have a charge of 3+, to balance the 2− on each of the three sulfate ions). Stock nomenclature, still in common use, writes the oxidation number in Roman numerals (..., −II, −I, 0, I, II,...). So the examples given above would be named iron(II) sulfate and iron(III) sulfate respectively. For simple ions the ionic charge and the oxidation number are identical, but for polyatomic ions they often differ. For example, the uranyl(2+) ion, , has uranium in an oxidation state of +6, so would be called a dioxouranium(VI) ion in Stock nomenclature. An even older naming system for metal cations, also still widely used, appended the suffixes -ous and -ic to the Latin root of the name, to give special names for the low and high oxidation states. For example, this scheme uses [...] "ferrous" [...] and [...] "ferric", for iron(II) and iron(III) respectively, so the examples given above were classically named ferrous sulfate and ferric sulfate.|$|E

2500|$|The gold-leaf {{electroscope}} {{was one of}} the [...] instruments used {{to indicate}} electric charge. It is still used for science demonstrations but has been superseded in most applications by electronic measuring instruments. The instrument consists of two thin leaves of gold foil suspended from an electrode. [...] When the electrode is charged by induction or by contact, the leaves acquire similar electric charges and repel each other due to the Coulomb force. Their separation is a <b>direct</b> <b>indication</b> of the net charge stored on them. On the glass opposite the leaves, pieces of tin foil may be pasted, so that when the leaves diverge fully they may discharge into the ground. [...] The leaves may be enclosed in a glass envelope to protect them from drafts, and the envelope may be evacuated to minimize charge leakage. A further cause of charge leakage is ionizing radiation, so to prevent this, the electrometer must be surrounded by lead shielding. [...] This principle has been used to detect ionizing radiation, as seen in the quartz fibre electrometer and Kearny fallout meter.|$|E

40|$|The {{chemical}} {{structure of the}} CdS/Cu 2 ZnSnSe 4 (CZTSe) interface was studied {{by a combination of}} electron and X-ray spectroscopies with varying surface sensitivity.

We find <b>direct</b> <b>indications</b> for the presence of Cd–S, Cd–Se, and Cd–Se–Zn bonds at the buffer/absorber interface.
