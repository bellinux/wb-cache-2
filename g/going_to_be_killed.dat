25|$|Jacob Drucker and Irving Cohen {{were put}} on trial {{separately}} {{for the murder of}} racketeer Walter Sage in the Catskills. Sage was killed with an ice pick and had the frame of a slot machine tied to his body, which was found in Swan Lake on July 31, 1937. After the Sage murder, believing he was also <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed,</b> Cohen fled to California and managed to secure small roles in films. According to the chief prosecution witness, Abraham Levine, Sage was riding in a car with Cohen and Drucker when he was stabbed 32 times with an icepick as Levine and Harry Strauss were following in another car. During the assault and struggle, Drucker stabbed Cohen once in the arm as Sage had grabbed the steering wheel and wrecked the car. Levine also testified that he observed Drucker wiping the icepick clean before helping dispose of the body. Cohen testified in his own defense, stating that Levine had stabbed him with an icepick as he was walking home from a casino. Cohen stated that he was assaulted by Levine and another man on Drucker's orders since he refused to pay 25% profit on a game of chance that he operated. Cohen was acquitted on June 21, 1940. Drucker, who was a suspect in four murders in the Catskills, was a fugitive for over three years, until the FBI located him in Delaware. Drucker was convicted of second-degree murder on May 5, 1944, and received a sentence of 25 years to life. Drucker died in Attica prison in January 1962.|$|E

2500|$|Beatrice Sherman, The New York Times Book Review (February 27, 1949) — [...] "A Nero Wolfe Threesome" [...] is the {{subtitle}} for {{this collection of}} mysteries. The opening situation in each story {{is that of a}} man who feels sure he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> and wants to pay Wolfe handsomely to stave off the evil day — permanently, if possible. Wolfe refuses to set his nimble brain, his bulky body or his trusted aide, Archie, working on such cases. The odds against a determined murderer are too long. Mr. Wolfe would rather devote himself to his orchids. As it turns out, Wolfe and Archie are drawn into the thick of all three cases, and solve them by playing their usual fast-and-loose game of cooperation with the police. Lovely going all the way, but not the Nero Wolfe-Archie team at its best.|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} of Théoden {{was inspired by}} a concept of courage as found in Norse mythology, particularly in the Beowulf epos: the protagonist of a story shows perseverance while knowing that he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> defeated and <b>killed.</b> This <b>is</b> reflected in Théoden's decision to ride against Sauron's far superior army in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. There are also repeated references by Tolkien to a historic account of the Battle of the Catalaunian Fields by Jordanes. Both battles take place between civilizations of the [...] "East" [...] and [...] "West", and like Jordanes, Tolkien describes his battle as one of legendary fame that lasted for several generations. Another apparent similarity is the death of king Theodoric I on the Catalaunian Fields and that of Théoden on the Pelennor. Jordanes reports that Theodoric was thrown off by his horse and trampled to death by his own men who charged forward. Théoden also rallies his men shortly before he falls and is crushed by his horse. And like Theodoric, Théoden is carried from the battlefield with his knights weeping and singing for him while the battle still goes on.|$|R

2500|$|... “It {{was night}} of the 17th to 18thJuly, 1918. When we were sure the whole town was asleep, we quietly stole through the window into the school building. Nobody there noticed our presence, they were already all asleep. We entered through the {{unlocked}} door into the building where the women were sleeping, and woke them up, telling them quietly to get dressed at once, as {{they were to be}} taken to a safe place because of the possibility of an armed attack. They obeyed silently. We tied their hands behind their backs there and then, blindfolded them, and let them out to the cart, which was already waiting by the school, sat them in it, and sent them off to their destination. After that, we went into the room occupied by the men. We told them the same story as we had told the women. The young princes Konstantinovich (KR's sons) and Prince Paley also obeyed meekly. We took them out into the corridor, blindfolded them, bound their hands behind their backs, and put them in another cart. We had earlier decided that the carts should not go together. The only one to try to oppose us was Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich. Physically he was stronger than the rest. We had to grapple with him. He told us categorically {{that he was not going}} anywhere, as he knew they all were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed.</b> He barricaded himself behind the cupboard and our efforts to get him out were in vain. We lost precious time. I finally lost my patience and shot at the Grand Duke. However, I only fired with the intention of wounding him slightly and frightening him into submission. I wounded him in the arm. He did not resist further. I bound his hand and covered his eyes. We put him in the last cart and set off. We were in a great hurry: already the dawn was heralding morning. Along the way, Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich again repeated that he knew they were all <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed.</b> “ Tell me why? He asked. “ I have never been involved in politics. I loved sports, played billiards, and was interested in numismatics. “ I reassured him as best as I could. although I was very agitated myself by everything I have been through that night. Despite his wounded arm, the Grand Duke did not complain. At last, we arrived at the mine. The shaft was not very deep and as it turned out had a ledge on one side that was not covered by water.” ...|$|E
60|$|Another {{element of}} comfort {{may have been}} the fact, that in the rough {{education}} of the forest, only the strong and healthy children lived, while the weakly died off young, and so the labour-market, as we should say now, was never overstocked. This is the case with our own gipsies, and with many savage tribes--the Red Indians, for instance--and accounts for their general healthiness: the unhealthy being all dead, in the first struggle for existence. But then these gipsies, and the Red Indians, do not increase in numbers, but the contrary; while our forefathers increased rapidly. On the other hand, we have, at least throughout the middle ages, accounts of such swarms of cripples, lepers, deformed, and other incapable persons, as to make some men believe that there were more of them, in proportion to the population, than there are now. And it may have been so. The strongest and healthiest men always <b>going</b> off <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> in war, the weakliest only would be left at home to breed; and so an unhealthy population might spring up. And again--and this is a curious fact--as law and order enter a country, so will the proportion of incapables, in body and mind, increase. In times of war and anarchy, when every one is shifting for himself, only the strongest and shrewdest can stand. Woe to those who cannot take care of themselves. The fools and cowards, the weakly and sickly, <b>are</b> <b>killed,</b> starved, neglected, or in other ways brought to grief. But when law and order come, they protect those who cannot protect themselves, and the fools and cowards, the weakly and sickly, are supported at the public expense, and allowed to increase and multiply as public burdens. I do not say that this is wrong, Heaven forbid! I only state the fact. A government is quite right in defending all alike from the brute competition of nature, whose motto is--Woe to the weak. To the Church of the middle age is due the preaching and the practice of the great Christian doctrine, that society <b>is</b> bound <b>to</b> protect the weak. So far the middle age saw: but no further. For our own times has been reserved the higher and deeper doctrine, that it is the duty of society to make the weak strong; to reform, to cure, and above all, to prevent by education, by sanitary science, by all and every means, the necessity of reforming and of curing.|$|R
2500|$|The {{salmonella}} {{attack was}} noted {{as the first}} confirmed instance of chemical or biological terrorism to {{have occurred in the}} United States. Rajneesh stated that because he was in silence and isolation, meeting only with Sheela, he was unaware of the crimes committed by the Rajneeshpuram leadership until Sheela and her [...] "gang" [...] left and sannyasins came forward to inform him. A number of commentators have stated that they believe that Sheela was being used as a convenient scapegoat. Others have pointed to the fact that although Sheela had bugged Rajneesh's living quarters and made her tapes available to the US authorities as part of her own plea bargain, no evidence has ever come to light that Rajneesh had any part in her crimes. Nevertheless, Gordon (1987) reports that Charles Turner, David Frohnmayer and other law enforcement officials, who had surveyed affidavits never released publicly and who listened to hundreds of hours of tape recordings, insinuated to him that Rajneesh [...] as guilty of more crimes than those for which he was eventually prosecuted. Frohnmayer asserted that Rajneesh's philosophy was not [...] "disapproving of poisoning" [...] and that he felt he and Sheela had been [...] "genuinely evil". Nonetheless, US Attorney Turner and Attorney General Frohnmeyer acknowledged that [...] "they had little evidence of (Rajneesh) being involved in any of the criminal activities that unfolded at the ranch". According to court testimony by Ma Ava (Ava Avalos), a prominent disciple, Sheela played associates a tape recording of a meeting she had had with Rajneesh about the [...] "need to kill people" [...] in order to strengthen wavering sannyasins resolve in participating in her murderous plots: [...] "She came back to the meeting and [...] began to play the tape. It was a little hard to hear what he was saying. [...] And the gist of Bhagwan's response, yes, it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> necessary <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> people to stay in Oregon. And that actually killing people wasn't such a bad thing. And actually Hitler was a great man, although he could not say that publicly because nobody would understand that. Hitler had great vision." [...] Sheela initiated attempts to murder Rajneesh's caretaker and girlfriend, Ma Yoga Vivek, and his personal physician, Swami Devaraj (Dr. George Meredith), because she thought that they <b>were</b> a threat <b>to</b> Rajneesh. She had secretly recorded a conversation between Devaraj and Rajneesh [...] "in which the doctor agreed to obtain drugs the guru wanted to ensure a peaceful death if he decided to take his own life".|$|R

Prater answered her call for help. She gasped, [...] "Virgil's dead", then collapsed. Prater shot a rifle in the air to summon another neighbor, Elmer Taylor. Prater called to Taylor to bring his car because Mr. and Mrs. Starks had been shot.

But it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a larger canvas, many more {{characters}} than in The Marriage Plot. Again, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> respond to a very small directive. It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> written, well, I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> say — but I know how it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> written and what the structure's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> and it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> quite different than The Marriage Plot." ...|$|R
2500|$|According to an {{interview}} executive producer Shawn Ryan gave to The Futon Critic [...] " [...] Mamet and I and our writers, {{we came up with}} a lot of great stuff," [...] Ryan said about his pitch to CBS executives for a potential fifth season. [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a whole new show in the sense that we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> training some young people, Bob <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> training some people for a whole new organization. Jonas <b>was</b> finally <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seeing his run end......The final season <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> I figured the fifth season <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the last... It <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a long, sort of final mission for Jonas. He's not medically cleared, Mack has to go in and sort of change the medical records so that Jonas can keep on [...] We had a whole thing planned, it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> good." [...] Jonas would eventually leave the army due to his injuries coupled with combat stress and reunite with Molly. Mack would take over the team but at the end of the series would also leave for a training post after Tiffy becomes pregnant with their third child. Bob would be badly injured in a parachuting accident and join the CIA as their Unit liaison. Ryan would take a demotion to regain control of The Unit whilst Bridget Sullivan would <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> on a mission halfway through the season. Charles Grey would take over as team leader with Sam McBride as his deputy training replacements for the personnel they have lost.|$|R

60|$|Besides these general matters, I had {{questions}} {{of my own}} to consider during those days of imprisonment--for instance, that of my own safety, though of this, to be honest, I thought little. If I were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed,</b> I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed,</b> {{and there was an}} end. But my knowledge of Dingaan {{told me that he had}} not massacred Retief and his companions for nothing. This would be but the prelude to a larger slaughter, for I had not forgotten what he said as to the sparing of Marie and the other hints he gave me.|$|E
