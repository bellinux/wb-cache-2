5|$|Cave and archeological remains {{indicate}} that {{the range of the}} marsh rice rat has extended substantially further north and west earlier in the Holocene, into central Texas, eastern Nebraska, southwestern Iowa, central Illinois, southern Indiana, southern Ohio, West Virginia, and southwestern Pennsylvania. Most northern archeological sites date from about 1000CE and are associated with corn cultivation, but in some older cave sites the rice rat is found with the extinct giant armadillo Dasypus bellus, suggesting warm climatic conditions. Perhaps a warm period during the Quaternary enabled the rice rat to disperse northward and when the climate cooled, relict populations were able to survive in the north as commensals in corn-cultivating Native American communities. Some subfossil animals are slightly larger than living marsh rice rats, possibly because <b>environmental</b> <b>constraints</b> were relaxed in commensal populations.|$|E

40|$|We have {{previously}} reported an optimum operation decision method {{which would be}} economical and satisfy <b>environmental</b> <b>constraint.</b> In this report, we consider the constraints of transmission capacity. Using the same method used for <b>environmental</b> <b>constraint,</b> we can also satisfy the transmission capacity constraints. But if we use this method, we must {{be prepared for the}} increased kinds of the numbers of Lagrange’s multipliers. The decision of these multipliers generally becomes increasingly difficult as the numbers increase. In this proposed method, only two Lagrange’s multipliers are used. That is to say, as a first step we consider only two constraints : the power supply and demand balance <b>constraint</b> and the <b>environmental</b> <b>constraint.</b> The result obtained from the above step is modified to satisfy the transmission capacity constraints and also to minimize the increase in operating costs. In {{the first half of this}} report，we consider the deterministic system load. In the latter half, we consider the case in which a system load varies probabilistically.

5|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that as much as}} another 1.2 GW of capacity remains available to exploit, mostly in the form of micro and small-hydro developments such as the existing one in Knoydart and a system planned for Kingussie. In reality, <b>environmental</b> <b>constraints</b> and given that the most easily available catchment areas have already been exploited {{it is unlikely that the}} full 1.2 GW will exploited. The 100 MW Glendoe Project which opened in 2009 was the first large scale dam in Scotland for almost fifty years but is likely to be one of the last of its kind. There is also further potential for new pumped storage schemes (at present used to meet peak demand) that would work with intermittent sources of power such as wind and wave. Examples include the 440 MW Cruachan Dam and 300 MW Falls of Foyers schemes. A 2011 report calculated that pumped storage hydro capacity could supply 2.8 GW of electricity for 5 hours, then drop to 1.1 GW and run out of water in 22 hours. The report concluded that even with projected new schemes at Loch Ness and Loch Sloy, pumped storage would not be able to replace wind electricity during extended windless periods.|$|E

40|$|A {{scheduling}} {{method is}} reported to satisfy the reliability limit and the <b>environmental</b> <b>constraint</b> when a line fault is regarded as probabilistic. The reliability limit is satisfied by changing the thermal output power to probabilistically achieve every line’s capacity. NO_x emission from thermal stations is limited as a typical <b>environmental</b> <b>constraint.</b> These constraints are economically achieved. The LaGrange’s method and the Kuhn-Tucker conditions are used to satisfy both the line capacity and the emission constraint. The LaGrange’s multipliers are decided by solving the simultaneous equations. An economical method of achieving the reliability limit is described using the probability of the line fault and the increase of the operating cost. 　Simulating the proposed method by a model system, the results are variously investigated. The proposed method is concretely confirmed to estimate the optimum operation which can economically satisfy the reliability limits and the emission constraints at various values. It is also shown that the proposed method can improve reliability by more than 16 ％. ...|$|R

30|$|Based on genome {{comparisons}} (from prokaryotes and eukaryotes), {{it seems}} that the occurrence of a single duplication event is much more common (giving rise to di-domains) in protein genes than several duplication events (Apic et al. 2001; Björklund et al. 2005), except for protein genes that were already multi-domain. In this case the replication of several domains at once is usually the norm, producing domain repeats (Björklund et al. 2005). As for other metazoans, the domain duplication in Branchipolynoe could be an internal response to a specific <b>environmental</b> <b>constraint</b> (Apic et al. 2001). In Branchipolynoe’s case, the low levels of oxygen (hypoxia) that result from the mixing of the anoxic hydrothermal vent fluid with the deep-sea water could be the <b>environmental</b> <b>constraint</b> that favored the appearance of the multi-domain hemoglobin (Hourdez et al. 1999 b).

40|$|We {{report an}} optimum {{operation}} decision method when a system load varies probabilistically and NO_x emission is constrained at every time. We use an energy storage facility for economic operation and <b>environmental</b> <b>constraint.</b> We consider the energy input/output {{balance of the}} energy storage facility for the expected value of the system load, but neglect variation from the expected value. When we do not consider the energy input/output balance, discharging energy is assumed to have been stored at a suitable expected load. Meanwhile, when we must consider the energy input/output balance, we repeat infinitesimal increases and decreases of the stored energy in order to decide optimum operation, because the discharged energy depends on the stored energy, and economy depends {{on the amount of}} input/output energy, where, we also use the conveixty of operating cost with the variation of input/output energy. A similar repeated method is used for <b>environmental</b> <b>constraint</b> and probability constraint. Because every group of thermal units has each cost curve, the load level at which energy should be stored or discharged is different for each thermal group. Then we attend to incremental fuel cost.

2500|$|The {{theoretical}} frame at {{the heart}} of processual archaeology is cultural evolutionism. [...] Processual archaeologists are, in almost all cases, cultural evolutionists. [...] It is from this perspective that they believe they can understand past cultural systems through the remains they left behind. [...] This is because processual archaeologists adhere to Leslie White's theory that culture can be defined as the exosomatic (outside the body) means of environmental adaptation for humans. In other words, they study cultural adaptation to environmental change rather than the bodily adaptation over generations, which is dealt with by evolutionary biologists. This focus on environmental adaptation is based on the cultural ecology and multilinear evolution ideas of anthropologists such as Julian Steward. [...] As exosomatic adaptation, culture is determined by <b>environmental</b> <b>constraints.</b> The result of this is that processual archaeologists propose that cultural change happens within a predictable framework and seek to understand it by the analysis of its components. [...] Moreover, since that framework is predictable, then science is the key to unlocking how those components interacted with the cultural whole. What this all means to processual archaeologists is that cultural changes are driven by evolutionary [...] "processes" [...] in cultural development, which will be adaptive relative to the environment and therefore not only understandable, but also scientifically predictable once the interaction of the variables is understood. [...] Thus one should be able to virtually completely reconstruct these [...] "cultural processes." [...] Hence came the name [...] "processual archaeology".

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that people often feel crowded when the environment gets in their way. This suggests that suitable measures of <b>environmental</b> <b>constraint</b> may be predictive of perceived crowding and environmental satisfaction. This study tests the hypothesis that environments that constrain the activities of their inhabitants less will be perceived as having greater quality and their inhabitants will be more satisfied with them. An office environment is used as a test case. How the physical environment constrains worker movements is assessed with several new quantitative measures. These measures vary depending on the difference between {{the size and shape of}} space that workers require for their activities and the space that is available. The spatial requirements of office activities were estimated from videotaped records of the routine activities of workers. A computer program developed for this study computed values for the measures of constraint for each of 194 workstations. These estimates of <b>environmental</b> <b>constraint</b> were then used to explain some of the variance observed in worker attitudes about their environment.

In this report, the optimum operation is considered {{as that which}} economically satisfiers all line capacities and <b>environmental</b> <b>constraint.</b> This method is developed in order to extend another method whose schedule satisfies many of the constraints of a faulty state in an electric power system. The limit of NO_x pollution is considered as a typical <b>environmental</b> <b>constraint.</b> Kuhn-Tucker conditions are shown for this problem.

The cost function of the quadratic programming is constituted by the quadratic equations which are selected from Kuhn-Tucker conditions. The cost function is modified to a linear equation. The results of the model system simulations are compared with the quadratic programming method and LaGrange’s multipliers method.
