50|$|The earlier GSX750 and GSX1200 Inazuma (GSX750W and GSX1200W) {{were offered}} in Japan and Europe {{for a short}} time besides the GSF1200 Bandit to cater for a {{clientele}} that went for a more traditional styling and a somewhat <b>higher</b> <b>build</b> quality. When they proved sufficiently popular for overseas export, they were quickly developed into the current GSX 1400.|$|R
50|$|Around 1947, {{the company}} {{introduced}} their first amateur radio receiver, the 75A-1 (called the 75A). This set achieved excellent stability {{for the time}} due to <b>high</b> <b>build</b> quality {{and the use of}} a permeability tuned oscillator (PTO) in its second conversion stage. It {{was one of the few}} double conversion superheterodynes on the market and covered only the amateur bands.|$|R
50|$|The MX6 {{received}} generally positive reviews. Forbes {{praised the}} device for its good value for money, <b>high</b> <b>build</b> quality {{due to its}} metal unibody frame and the gesture feature in Flyme OS, noting that “the Meizu MX6 is the best bargain on the market”.Another review has stated that the rear camera represents a significant improvement {{in comparison to the}} previous generation.|$|R
50|$|Quantex {{computers}} were built {{to a high}} standard, and regularly won awards in many computer publications. Even {{up to the point}} that they filed for Chapter 11, the awards were still being dealt out. The attraction for many was that Quantex combined <b>high</b> <b>build</b> quality, great technical support (before the financial trouble), brand-name components and above all lower cost than most rivals.|$|R
50|$|ECTFE powder {{has been}} used for several decades in {{electrostatic}} powder coating. It has a good film forming characteristic, can be applied in certain cases directly to the metal without a primer and leads to a high coating thickness. ECTFE powder coatings have a typical thickness of 0,8 mm but can be applied up to 2 mm with a special grade for <b>high</b> <b>build</b> up.|$|R
50|$|<b>High</b> <b>Build</b> is {{a process}} which uses a type of varnish against a lower mesh count with many coats of {{emulsion}} or a thicker grade of emulsion (e.g., Capillex®). After the varnish passes through to the substrate, an embossed-appearing, 'raised' area of varnish is created. When cured {{at the end of}} the process, the varnish yields a Braille effect, hence the term 'High Build'.|$|R

50|$|Anhalt Apartments {{have been}} {{recognized}} both for their <b>high</b> <b>build</b> quality and for {{the speed with which}} they were constructed. Anhalt's company often completed construction of a building within fewer than three months, and usually constructed several buildings simultaneously. Anhalt achieved this balance through vertical integration and by taking advantages of efficiencies of scale—by centralizing design and construction within the same firm, and placing large orders with local suppliers of brick, tile and other building materials.|$|R
50|$|While well {{regarded}} for its <b>high</b> <b>build</b> {{quality and}} reliability {{in comparison to}} the rifles of the time, its marketability was limited, as it was not developed in time for use in World War II but later, as many militaries had already begun the switch to selective fire assault rifles. An unknown number of FN-49's were produced as selective fire automatic rifles, but the small 10 round box magazine limited the usefulness of the fully automatic feature.|$|R

50|$|A {{good quality}} cargo barrier should consist of rigid {{fabricated}} steel frame with welded mesh insert, tough coated finish (i.e. Nylon Powder coating), supports mounted {{to the vehicle}} C Posts or the vehicle frame (to transfer any impacted load onto the vehicle chassis rather than rear seats) and easy fitment and removal. Universal barriers generally are a poorer fit and install, are cheaper and allow for multi-vehicle installation. Whereas tailored / custom cargo barriers are generally of a much <b>higher</b> <b>build</b> quality, are more rigidly installed, and provide better long term security.|$|R

Before the {{acquisition}} of the extra power, the Mondial's performance was pleasant but not supercar-ish enough to please those who can be - and were - easily won over to other camps. Now it has the urge to please a wider area of buyers, coupled the refinement of suspension, ride quality noise suppression and drivetrain smoothness that makes it uncompromisingly modern. Plus a very <b>high</b> <b>build</b> quality and enough promise of real durability to set the sale on longevity..." [...] Car 1983 ...|$|R
5000|$|Because of the 2000s high {{production}} costs, Fiat was not {{in favor}} of putting the model into production, despite it being ready for production in 1969, which delayed its launch. But {{in the absence of any}} other new Lancia flagship models being ready, the 2000 was nonetheless launched in 1971. The 2000 was considered by many fans of the marque to be [...] "the last real Lancia" [...] due to the <b>high</b> <b>build</b> quality that the later models (Beta and Gamma) lacked. It was produced until 1974 with a total of 14,319 examples being made.|$|R
5|$|The serval {{is similar}} to the {{sympatric}} caracal, but has a narrower spoor, a rounder skull, and lacks its prominent ear tufts. The African golden cat is darker, with different cranial features. It resembles the cheetah in its <b>build</b> and <b>coat</b> pattern, though not in size. The serval shares its adaptations to its marshy habitat with the jungle cat; both cats have large and sharp ears that help in locating the prey efficiently, and their long legs raise them above muddy ground and water.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Wire+arc {{additive}} manufacture (WAAM) is a <b>high</b> <b>build</b> rate {{process for}} production of near-net shape components layer by layer. The performance {{and quality of}} the deposited metal are heavily affected by the properties of wires, which are the raw materials for WAAM. Therefore there may be higher requirements for the qualities and properties of wires for WAAM than for welding. External surface qualities, micro hardness, composition and microstructures of five ER 4043 aluminium wires were investigated in the present research. The results indicate that the internal and external properties of the wires exert great influence on the performance of the WAAM parts...|$|R

A lower-cost version, called the Export, with the power supply moved into the plinth was released in the late 1980s. The PT TOO {{was replaced by the}} PT Anniversary, with much <b>higher</b> <b>build</b> quality, and returned to a glass top plate and a DC motor mounted on a new composite subchassis, along with a new external power supply, some of which featured a rechargeable battery power source topped-up from the mains supply.|$|R
