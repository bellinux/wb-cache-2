This paper analyzesroll call votes {{from the third}} and fourthlegislatures (1989 – 1999) of <b>the</b> <b>EuropeanParliament</b> to test predictions from threetypes of theories of abstention: (1) decision-theoretic approach of RationalChoice theory, (2) game-theoretic approachof Rational Choice theory, and (3) theSwing Voter’s Curse theory. The resultsindicate that closeness significantlydecreases the rate of abstention. Thefindings also show that an increase in theprobability {{of being in the}} majorityincreases turnout. Overall, findings aresupportive of the decision-theoreticapproach of Rational Choice theory butnot of the game-theoretic approach toabstention or the Swing Voter’s Cursetheory.

40|$|This article {{introduces}} {{a model of}} policy preference formation in legislative politics. Emphasizing a dynamic relationship between structure, agent, and decision-making process, it ties the question of policy choice to the dimensionality of the normative and cognitive political space and the strategic actions of parliamentary agenda setters. The model proposes that structural factors, such as ideology, shape policy preferences {{to the extent that}} legislative actors successfully link them to specific policy proposals through the strategic provision of focal points. These ideas or images shift attention toward particular aspects of a legislative proposal, thus shaping the dominant interpretation of its content and consequences. This interpretation affects both individual-level policy preferences and policy outcomes. The propositions of the focal-point model are tested empirically in a detailed examination of European Union legislation on cross-border takeover bids, using both qualitative and quantitative methods. Recent literature on the politics of <b>the</b> <b>EuropeanParliament</b> (EP) has identified the dimensionalstructure of the European political space to be es-sentially two-dimensional. It suggests that Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) act {{on the basis of their}} posi-tions on a dimension ranging from support to opposition of the European integration process on the one hand, and of the traditional Left-Right divide on the other (Gabe...|$|R
