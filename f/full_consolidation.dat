40|$|Treatment of non-unions {{and delayed}} unions often {{requires}} osteogenic material. Recently, a biomimetic bone matrix that simulates the cellular environment of hard tissue, identified as P- 15, {{was introduced to}} the orthopaedic community. A total of 22 patients with mal-union or delayed union fractures was treated from June 2000 to October 2003 with P 15 - bone graft substitute (P 15 -BGS) in the site of fracture and mostly with internal fixation. Patients were examined by independent radiographic analysis. Assessment criteria included time elapsed until bone bridging and time to <b>full</b> <b>consolidation.</b> In addition, histological assessment of the callus was done at the time of recovery of metal implants in five patients. <b>Full</b> <b>consolidation</b> was achieved in 90 % (20 out of 22) of the patients treated with P 15 -BGS. The average time for <b>full</b> <b>consolidation</b> was 4. 2  months. Histological assessment of the fracture callus in five of the patients confirmed the positive clinical and radiographic results. P 15 -BGS appears to offer a safe, economical and clinically useful alternative to autograft in the repair of ununited fractures. These results compare favourably with those in the published literature as an alternative to autograft...|$|E

We find that a nonredistribu-tive tax is neutral. A progressive tax always impairs entrepreneurship while the effect on welfare can be positive or zero, depending on the specification of moral hazard. Some results may also depend on the concrete formulation of preferences. 1...|$|R

40|$|When {{multiple}} {{items are}} learned in sequential order, learning for one item {{tends to be}} disrupted by subsequently learned items. Such retrograde interference has been studied with paradigms conducted over a relatively short term. Resistance to interference is generally {{believed to be a}} measure of learning or consolidation. Here, we used a finger-tapping motor sequence paradigm to examine interference in prolonged motor learning. Three groups of 9 subjects participated in training sessions for 16 days, and practiced three different sequences in different orders and combinations. We found that a well-trained motor sequence was subject to a gradual interference when the subsequent learning was paired in a particular order. The results suggest that a well-learned motor memory is still susceptible to interference, and that resistance to interference in one condition does not necessarily imply <b>full,</b> permanent <b>consolidation...</b>|$|R

40|$|The author models {{the choice}} between credit cards and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) within a {{framework}} where consumers hold lines of credit as instruments of consumption smoothing across state and time. Flexible repayment schemes for lines of credit induce risk-averse consumers with sufficiently high discount rates to underinsure and hold lines of credit instead as a buffer, even when {{they have access to}} full and fair insurance markets. Weighing the fixed upfront fees and higher default costs of HELOCs against the advantages of low and income-tax-deductible interest payments, the author finds a threshold level of potential borrowing belowwhich consumers prefer to use credit cards exclusively. Above that threshold, consumers decide touse HELOCs and consolidate all outstanding credit card debt into them; however, a rising probability of default and the resulting loss of equity in the home will put an upper bound on the potential HELOC borrowing that will prevent <b>full</b> debt <b>consolidation.</b> Credit and credit aggregates...|$|R

Previous models have exhibited decreasing accuracy when applied to powders and porous materials of high initial porosity. This deficiency has been avoided in the present model. A special feature of this model is provision for a cold pressure loading relation which covers the <b>full</b> range of <b>consolidation</b> mechanics including relative particle movement, elastic and plastic deformation,fracture and bulk compression. This empirical cold loading relation is incorporated into a Mie–Grüneisen treatment of the shock process.

A limiting density ratio is prediced at high shock strengths. The accuracy of the model is demonstrated by comparison with previously published shock compaction data...|$|R

As a young region in <b>full</b> process of <b>consolidation,</b> the Danube Delta represents a very favourable place {{for the development of}} highly diverse flora and fauna, unique in Europe, with numerous rare species. It hosts 23 natural ecosystems, but due to the extent of wetlands an aquatic environment is prevalent; a terrestrial environment is also present on the higher grounds of the continental levees, where xerophile ecosystems have developed. Between the aquatic and terrestrial environments is interposed a swampy, easily flooded strip of original flora and fauna, with means of adaptation to water or land, depending on the season or hydrological regime. At the contact between freshwater and sea water, some special physical, chemical and biological processes take place, which have led biologists to consider this area as a very different ecosystem called beforedelta. Musura Gulf, north of Sulina, and Saint George Gulf are considered the most representative of this type of ecosystem.|$|R
