5000|$|The {{emergence}} of Iraqi Security Forces throughout Fallujah allowed the Marines {{to consider a}} Civil Affairs “hearts and minds” program that many thought Marines would be doing when they first returned to Iraq in 2004. In this operation, Marines conducted a two-day operation in Sheik Khamis’ area that included Civil Affairs Officers, Legal Officers, physicians and veterinarians. Van Opdorp said the physicians and veterinarians treated hundreds of Iraqis and herds of sheep and cattle. The Legal Officers, he said, made payments for various small claims that Iraqis in that area had against the American forces. The operation was a tremendous success. “When you {{do something like that}} [...] [...] [...] they come to realize more and more that these guys aren’t occupiers, they are <b>just</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>help</b> us so we can help ourselves.”Van Opdorp said, “I think that the transition of Fallujah to the 2nd Brigade the Iraqi Army and to the Iraqi Police was a tremendous accomplishment that 1/24 will look at.” He credited the 60% reduction in violent acts during his battalion’s tenure in Fallujah to the work his Marines did in creating conditions to return responsibility for certain functions to Iraqi control.|$|R

5000|$|Jesus first {{appears in}} the fifth episode of the season, [...] "Go Getters", where he {{attempts}} to comfort Maggie and Sasha (who are hiding in the Hilltop from Negan) on their lost loved ones. Gregory decides {{that the two of}} them must leave and when Jesus disagrees, Gregory states he is free to go with them. Sasha later tells Jesus that he should be in charge of the community, though he insists that he <b>just</b> <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>help,</b> Sasha tells him he might have to do more. When the Hilltop is attacked by walkers let in by the Saviors, Jesus helps Sasha fend them off (once again showing off his impressive skills in hand-to hand combat) while Maggie destroys the car system drawing them in. The next day, Jesus continues to argue with Gregory as he refuses to turn away Maggie (who is pregnant) as well as Sasha as the two helped save them. When Simon, one of the head Saviors, arrives at the Hilltop, Gregory attempts to turn over the two, but is foiled by Jesus hiding them elsewhere. When confronted about it, Jesus tells him they are all staying and though he doesn't want to be in charge, Gregory won't be either. The episode ends with Jesus sneaking aboard one of the Savior's trucks in order to find Negan where he discovers Carl Grimes already there, bent on killing Negan. Jesus briefly {{appears in the}} following episode [...] "Sing Me a Song", as he and Carl continue towards the Sanctuary. Jesus uses syrup from the supply shipment to mark a trail for them before suggesting they jump out and continue following on foot as [...] "it's not the fall that gets you. It's fighting it." [...] He then rolls from the truck only to see Carl did not follow him, much to Jesus's amusement. He is later seen on top of a truck as Carl leaves the Sanctuary. He is then seen in [...] "Hearts Still Beating" [...] where he finds Daryl inside the Sanctuary and helps him escape. Jesus is later seen watching Daryl and Maggie reunite with their friends and walks beside them as they go to plan for their fight against the Saviors. The following episode [...] "Rock in the Road" [...] shows Rick and Jesus failing to convince Gregory to fight the Saviors. They do find several members of the community who come forward <b>to</b> volunteer their <b>help.</b> As the group discusses strategies for beating the Saviors, Rick states they need more help, Jesus tells them he knows a group who can <b>help.</b> <b>To</b> this end he brings them to the Kingdom, a flourishing community that are also forced to serve the Saviors. Jesus is shown to be well known there and is on good terms with their leader, King Ezekiel. When Ezekiel refuses to join their fight, Jesus leaves with the others and later returns to the Hilltop with Sasha. [...] "The Other Side" [...] shows Jesus bonding with Maggie and revealing more of his past to her (including that he grew up in a corporal camp and that he is gay) and stating that she and Sasha help him feel more at home. He provides Sasha with a layout of the Sanctuary <b>to</b> <b>help</b> with her plans to kill Negan (though he disagrees with her decision). Jesus is later confronted by Gregory who states he has been shirking his scavenging/scouting duties and has too many people in his trailer. When Gregory mentions that he should show more respect or something may happen with the Saviors constantly coming around, Jesus quickly sees Gregory is threatening him. Gregory denies it, but also claims that he takes care of his friends and {{that the two of them}} are not friends. In [...] "Something They Need", Jesus is part of the group Rick takes to a community called Oceanside with the intent of stealing their weapons. Their plan succeeds, but Jesus appears to be conflicted about their actions.|$|R
