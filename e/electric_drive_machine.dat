40|$|This master’s thesis mainly {{focuses on}} the design {{requirements}} of an Electric drive for Hybrid car application and its control strategy to achieve a wide speed range. It also emphasises how the control and performance requirements are transformed into its design variables. A parallel hybrid topology is considered where an IC engine and an electric drive share a common crank shaft. A permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) is used as an <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> <b>machine.</b> Performance requirements are converted into Machine design variables using the vector model of PMSM. Main dimensions of the machine are arrived using analytical approach and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is used to verify the design and performance. Vector control algorithm was used to control the machine. The control algorithm was tested in a low power PMSM using an embedded controller. A prototype of 10 kW PMSM was built according to the design values. The prototype was tested in the laboratory using a high power converter. Tests were carried out to verify different operating modes. The results were {{in agreement with the}} calculations...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{focuses on}} direct torque control (DTC) for {{three-phase}} ac <b>electric</b> <b>drives.</b> A novel model predictive control scheme is proposed {{that keeps the}} motor torque, the stator flux, and (if present) the inverter’s neutral point potential within given hysteresis bounds while minimizing the switching frequency of the inverter. Based on an internal model of the drive, the con-troller predicts several future switch transitions, extrapolates the output trajectories, and chooses the sequence of inverter switch positions (voltage vectors) that minimizes the switching frequency. The advantages of the proposed controller are twofold. First, as underlined by the experimental results {{in the second part}} of this paper, it yields a superior performance with respect to the industrial state of the art. Specifically, the switching frequency is reduced by up to 50 % while the torque and flux are kept more accurately within their bounds. Moreover, the fast dynamic torque response is inherited from standard DTC. Second, the scheme is applicable to a large class of (three-phase) ac <b>electric</b> <b>machines</b> <b>driven</b> by inverters.

40|$|M. Sc. (Electrical & Electronic Engineering) The {{behaviour}} of {{alternating current}} machines being fed from an electronic commutator is investigated. The performance of compound power switches {{for use in}} <b>electric</b> vehicle <b>drives</b> are examined. A detailed study on switching losses and base current characteristics based upon experimental measurements was carried out. With further reference to power switches the merit, development and functioning of an electronic commutator is discussed. Because of the close association between this study and <b>electric</b> vehicle <b>drives,</b> a comparative study {{of the performance of}} different rotor types within the same machine was executed. Attention is paid to torque and efficiency characteristics in particular. The influence of voltage and current harmonics was established by comparative testing of the machine with sinusoidal and electronic commutator excitation. The study shows that the highest specific power was attained with the alternating current machine with a wound rotor (synchronous machine) while there seems to be merit in the use of permanent magnet rotors for <b>electric</b> <b>drives</b> as well. On the average the use of electronic commutator excitation resulted in an efficiency decrease of approximately 15 % for the a. c. machine with different rotor types. Efficiency and torque for an induction machine with solid rotor were disappointing so that there seems to be little application for solid steel rotors. A simple model for the synchronous machine with wound rotor was developed to explain the dependence of torque and efficiency upon speed of rotation and commutation angle.

40|$|Technology for the axial gap motor was {{developed}} by DOE with an investment of approximately $ 15 million. This development effort is for motor technologies of high power density and high efficiency. Such motors that are also small and light-weight are not available on the commercial market because high-power motors have typically been used in large industrial applications where small size and light weight are not requirements. AC Delco has been developing motors since 1918 and is interested in leveraging its research and development dollars to produce an array of motor systems for vehicles {{and to develop a}} future line of propulsion products. The DOE focus of the study was applied to machining applications. The most attractive feature of this motor is the axial air gap, which may make possible the removal of the motor`s stationary component from a total enclosure of the remainder of the machine if the power characteristics are adequate. The objectives of this project were to evaluate alternative <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> systems for <b>machine</b> tools and automotive <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> systems and to select a best machine type for each of those applications.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} {{parametric}} optimization of a flux-switching electrical machine customized for a wind tur-bine application with a typical operating range for average and low-power wind energy sites. Statistics of wind resources {{are taken into}} consideration for the machine design for definition of the turbine power envelope. Both copper and iron losses for three different machine designs are evaluated. A very important consideration taken in this design is the elimination of gearbox requirements for coupling to the turbine. Although the devel-oped approach makes the machine somewhat voluminous, the overall performance is highly improved because a direct-drive flux-switching electrical generator becomes very competitive for small-scale wind turbines.

40|$|A Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) utilises an <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> and a {{conventional}} {{internal combustion engine}} to achieve increased fuel economy and/or performance. The architecture of the vehicle, and the design focus, significantly affects the demands made on the <b>electric</b> <b>drive.</b> These demands are typically expressed as the <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> duty, in terms of motor speed and torque.

For any given vehicle, there is no simple <b>electric</b> <b>drive</b> rating calculation for the range of hybrid vehicle architectures possible.
