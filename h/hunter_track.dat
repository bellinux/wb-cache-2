50|$|Certain {{accessories}} for {{a flashlight}} allow {{the color of}} the light to be altered or allow light to be dispersed differently.

Such marshalling wands are frequently used for directing automobiles or aircraft at night. Colored lenses placed over the end of the flashlight are used for signalling, for example, in railway yards. Colored light is occasionally useful for <b>hunters</b> <b>tracking</b> wounded game after dusk, or for forensic examination of an area. A red filter helps preserve night vision after the flashlight is turned off, and can be useful to observe animals (such as nesting Loggerhead sea turtles) without disturbing them.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike Russian wolf hunts with hounds, which occur {{usually in}} the summer period when wolves have less {{protective}} fur and the terrain is more favourable for the hounds to give chase, Kazakhstani wolf hunts with hounds depend on favourable snow conditions. The hunts take place either in the steppes regions of the country, or in semi-deserts. The <b>hunters</b> <b>track</b> wolves on horseback, with their dogs in sleds. Once a wolf is spotted, the dogs are released from the sled, and give chase.There is Kazakh breed of such very big dog called Tobet. Anecdoticall evidence [...] says Kazakh used to feed puppies from a pot (it-ayak in Kazakh) made from wolves skin so they recognize the smell of wolves as food automatically from early age.|$|R

5|$|Mauna Kea's great {{elevation}} and the steepness of its flanks {{provide a}} better view and a shorter hike than the adjacent Mauna Loa. The high elevation with its risk of altitude sickness, weather concerns, steep road grade, and overall inaccessibility make the volcano dangerous and summit trips difficult. Until the construction of roads in the mid-20th century, only the hardy visited Mauna Kea's upper slopes; <b>hunters</b> <b>tracked</b> game animals, and hikers traveled up the mountain. These travelers used stone cabins constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s as base camps, and it is from these facilities that the modern mid-level Onizuka Center for International Astronomy telescope support complex is derived. The first Mauna Kea summit road was built in 1964, making the peak itself accessible to larger numbers of people.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Skalaar {{runs into}} trouble when a rival bounty <b>hunter</b> <b>tracks</b> {{him down and}} demands that he turn over Archer. Skalaar refuses, and the rival opens fire. In the battle, Archer convinces Skalaar to {{temporarily}} free him, {{and the two men}} land on a nearby planet to make repairs. As they work, Archer learns more about Skalaar's circumstances. Skalaar turns Archer over to the Klingons as planned, but ends up receiving only two-thirds of the promised reward. In revenge, he alerts Enterprise to the location of the Klingon ship, and Archer escapes in an escape pod. Enterprise arrives and retrieves Archer, damaging the Klingon ship enough to end the battle. Some time later, Skalaar contacts Archer and warns that the price on Archer's head will probably double. Grateful, Archer bids Skalaar farewell.|$|R
