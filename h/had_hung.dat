5|$|Fans gained {{national}} attention after giving a torrid time to David Beckham {{in his first}} away match of 1998–99 the season after the England midfielder was sent off for a petulant foul on Diego Simeone. Coinciding with the game, there were claims (and an image taken) that fans, organised by a hardcore, <b>had</b> <b>hung</b> an effigy of the player outside a local pub. Although it was later revealed that the pub was in South-East London, the heartland of West Ham's greatest rivals Millwall. The West Ham fans did, however, boo Beckham's every touch of the ball during the game.|$|E
5|$|Between 1996 and 1999, the {{administration}} added crucifixes to many classroom walls, {{a change that}} attracted national attention. Before 1996, crucifixes <b>had</b> <b>hung</b> only in hospital rooms and historic classrooms. Some of these crucifixes are historic works of art, and are noted as such. According to Imam Yahya Hendi, the school's on-campus Muslim cleric, pressure to remove the crucifixes comes from within the Catholic community, while he and other campus faith leaders have defended their placement. The Intercultural Center is an exception to this controversy, rotating displays of various faith and culture symbols in the lobby. In 2009, Georgetown's religious symbols were brought back to national attention after the university administration concealed the name of Jesus in preparation for President Barack Obama's speech on campus.|$|E
5|$|Finally, at the end, a bus {{shows up}} outside the Krusty Krab, despite Squidward {{claiming}} that the buses do not run this late at night. The bus then drops off a mysterious dark silhouette matching {{the description of the}} Hash-Slinging Slasher. SpongeBob and Squidward immediately realize that they are experiencing genuine supernatural events and panic. When the strange, unidentified figure enters the building, it is revealed he is simply a kid applying for a job, stating that he had tried calling the Krusty Krab by telephone earlier, but <b>had</b> <b>hung</b> up out of nervousness (the bus that he arrived in remains unexplained). However, Squidward then questions who was flickering the lights earlier. It is then revealed that the flickering lights are caused by doctored footage of Count Orlok from the 1922 silent film Nosferatu, with whom the characters are inexplicably familiar, flicking the light switch on and off.|$|E

5|$|Many of the family's {{extensive}} {{collection of}} paintings, most sourced from Spain by William, were {{donated to the}} Trust. In part {{this was due to}} their poor condition, which involved not just water but also ironically guano damage. The most important painting in the collection is the 17th-century work by Zambrano of St Lawrence, which hangs in the middle of one of the walls of the hall. It was cleaned and repaired by local art conservators Bush and Berry, who are based in a chapel William Gibbs built in the village of Flax Bourton. In 2011 the Trust bought the painting The Mater Dolorosa (Mother of Sorrows) by Bartolomé Esteban Murillo at Christie's auction in New York, which <b>had</b> <b>hung</b> at Tyntesfield since William purchased it until some time after 1910.|$|E

25|$|The {{book was}} not an {{enormous}} success, but has persisted. In 1965 a review by Bryan Magee for Encounter observed that the book <b>had</b> <b>hung</b> on in libraries as an adventure tale for children, but regretted that it was neglected by adults. The review recognised that perhaps its greatest interest was now the insight it gave as to Churchill's beliefs as a young man. The character of Savrola identified precisely with Churchill himself, with what he wished to be and what he later became.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the manager of the life preserver manufacturer placed iron bars inside the cork preservers to meet minimum weight requirements at the time. Many of the life preservers had been filled with cheap and less effective granulated cork and brought up to proper weight by the inclusion of the iron weights. Canvas covers, rotted with age, split and scattered the powdered cork. Managers of the company (Nonpareil Cork Works) were indicted but not convicted. The life preservers had been manufactured in 1891 and <b>had</b> <b>hung</b> above the deck, unprotected from the elements, for 13 years.|$|E

25|$|In 1748, the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, {{which ended}} the War of the Austrian Succession, {{restored}} Louisbourg to France {{in return for}} territory gained in the Austrian Netherlands and the British trading post at Madras in India. Maurepas, the ministre de la marine, was determined to have it back. He regarded the fortified harbour as essential to maintaining French dominance in the fisheries of the area. The disgust of the French in this transaction was matched by that of the English colonists. The New England forces left, taking with them the famous Louisbourg Cross, which <b>had</b> <b>hung</b> in the fortress chapel. This cross was rediscovered in the Harvard University archives only in the later half of the 20th century; it is now on long-term loan to the Louisbourg historic site.Having given up Louisbourg, Britain in 1749 created its own fortified town on Chebucto Bay which they named Halifax. It soon became the largest Royal Navy base on the Atlantic coast and hosted large numbers of British army regulars. The 29th Regiment of Foot was stationed there; they cleared the land for the port and settlement.|$|E
500|$|It is {{not clear}} whether the baby was Carrie or another baby of Laura's, or what became of the child. William Bittle and Gilbert Geis wrote in 1964 that Laura had been caring for a baby while in jail, and had the child with her when she was taken from her cell. They quoted a woman who had seen either the lynching or its aftermath, and who said that Laura had placed the baby on the ground: [...] "After they <b>had</b> <b>hung</b> them up, those men just walked off and left that baby lying there. One of my neighbors was there, and she picked the baby up and brought it to town, and we took care of it. It's all grown up now and lives here." ...|$|E
500|$|Returning to Singapore in 1979 after {{completing}} his undergraduate studies, Tang engaged in performance art, [...] {{works of art}} that are composed of actions performed by the artist at a certain place and time. The following year, he staged a work of [...] installation art called Earthworks at the National Museum Art Gallery. This comprised two works, The Product of the Sun and Me and The Product of the Rain and Me, which were made up of dishes of earth, lumps of soil, and pieces of soiled and water-stained linen which he <b>had</b> <b>hung</b> in gullies at Ang Mo Kio, a construction site {{in the process of}} being turned into a public housing estate. Installation art uses sculptural materials, and sometimes other media such as sound, video and performance, to modify the way a particular space is experienced.|$|E

500|$|Also on {{the first}} floor is the [...] "Chapel Drawing Room" [...] in the south wing, {{connected}} to the Drawing Room. The Copes created this room by reducing the size of the original chapel, which is entered through it. The current chapel has an altar reredos with paintings of the Virgin Mary, St. Stephen, St. Mary Magdalene and St. John the Evangelist, by Alexander Rowan and dated by Pevsner to about 1840. The tapestry in the chapel room is older than the house, and was assessed by an expert as dating to 1450 or earlier; in the early 19th century it <b>had</b> <b>hung</b> in the Red Drawing Room. When the chapel ceiling was restored by Sir William Cope, it was discovered that one section of the plaster work had previously been replaced with carved wood. The large window in the south wall of the courtyard was presumably moved from the original chapel.|$|E
500|$|While {{promoting}} the album, Cole said [...] "R, rock and pop {{has always been}} my forte" [...] and called the music something {{she wished she had}} recorded [...] "at least five years ago". She revealed her dissatisfaction with being labeled a jazz singer and her desire to showcase her versatility as an artist, saying she aimed to [...] "put out some music that we hadn't heard in a long time from anybody, really". The project was Cole's first collaboration with R producer Dallas Austin. Rashod Ollison of The Virginian-Pilot wrote the album represented how [...] " [...] <b>had</b> <b>hung</b> up the gowns and returned to her soul roots"; in past performances, Cole would wear gowns when singing jazz. During the production of the album, Verve Records stipulated that it must include original material. One of the two new songs [...] "Five Minutes Away" [...] was based on Cole's experiences with Austin and keyboard player Chanz Parkman. Prior to the album's release, CBS News Caitlin Johnson wrote that it was [...] "a sharp turn for a woman perhaps best known for singing jazz standards." [...] She connected the project to Cole's decision to reinvent herself, saying that its title represented [...] "leaving the past behind".|$|E
500|$|On November 3, 1945, American {{illustrator}} Norman Rockwell drew {{a picture}} {{of one of the}} Marshall Field's Building clocks {{on the cover of the}} famous [...] "Saturday Evening Post" [...] magazine, entitled [...] "The Clock Mender". [...] The Rockwell painting shows a man perched atop a ladder and adjusting one of the Marshall Field's clock to correspond with his own pocket watch. [...] The old Oriental Theatre in the background proves this depicts the matching [...] "Great Clock" [...] at the northwest corner of the building at State & Randolph Streets. In 1948, Rockwell donated the original painting, [...] "The Clock Mender", to the store, where it <b>had</b> <b>hung</b> on the seventh floor ever since. After Target Corporation sold Field's to the May Department Stores, which later merged with Federated Department Stores in 2005, the Federated officials discovered a reproduction copy on display. Federated removed the fake copy and asked Target to return the original. [...] The painting has since been donated to the Chicago Historical Society, which had from February 26, 2000 to May 21, 2000 been the second stop of the seven-city national tour of [...] "Pictures for the American People", the first comprehensive Rockwell career exhibition that had been organized by the High Museum of Art of Atlanta and the Norman Rockwell Museum of Stockbridge, Massachusetts and that had also visited the Solomon R.
