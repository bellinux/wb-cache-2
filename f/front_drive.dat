25|$|Eventually, {{spurred by}} bands such as Sunny Day Real Estate, the band began to {{experiment}} with slower tempos and more varied song structures. As they began writing songs and touring in the indie scene, the band encountered like-minded bands, such as Christie <b>Front</b> <b>Drive,</b> Sense Field, and Seven Storey Mountain, that were working on similar sounds.|$|E
25|$|After {{the closing}} of the 1933 World's Fair, in late winter 1935 the Century of Progress houses were moved from Chicago to Indiana. Robert Bartlett {{purchased}} the homes with the intent of using them to sell more properties in his new residential development called Beverly Shores. Owing to their lakefront location in Chicago and their future lakefront location in Indiana, it was determined the easiest way to transport the homes was by barge. The houses were rolled off the barge on telephone poles onto a heavy timber crib built out into the lake. There were a series of three steps used to raise the house to the level of Lake <b>Front</b> <b>Drive.</b>|$|E

25|$|In the 85D, {{the rear}} drive unit is {{replaced}} by a smaller one to save cost and weight, while the second motor of similar size is added to the front wheels. This results in an AWD car with comparable power and acceleration to the RWD version. Additionally, Tesla said the 85D has a 2% (5-mile) range increase and 11% increase in top speed over the 85. In the P85D, the high-power rear drive unit is retained, while a new <b>front</b> <b>drive</b> motor boosts the total power by about 50%. This results in a significant increase in acceleration and top speed. Deliveries of the P85D started in December 2014, with the 85D models starting in February 2015, and the 70D models starting in April 2015.|$|E

2500|$|Both the Century GS and {{the larger}} Riviera GS (which also had been {{continually}} produced since 1965) were discontinued after the 1975 model year due to sagging sales for high-performance cars following the 1973–74 energy crisis and subsequent trends toward smaller and more fuel-efficient cars.
