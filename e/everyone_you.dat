Jason Lipshutz of Billboard said [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] is [...] "a sunny pop track that finds Lea Michele and Cory Monteith railing against conformity and celebrating their individuality in their verses". Other cast member lyrics include the lyric [...] "You may think I'm a freak show", responded to by Naya Rivera with the spoken [...] "I don't care". The song features self-empowerment lyrics which revolve around revenge fantasies, such as in Monteith's lines - [...] "I could be a superstar / I'll see you when you wash my car". According to Melinda Newman of HitFix the song is about [...] "being a loser now, but turning in to a winner now who never, ever looks back". Aly Semigran of MTV News said the lyrics of the [...] "peppy pop ditty" [...] keep [...] "in tune with the themes of the show".|$|E
500|$|During {{its first}} run, Bringing Up Baby made $715,000 in the U.S. and $394,000 in foreign markets {{for a total}} of $1,109,000; its reissue in 1940 and 1941 made an {{additional}} $95,000 in the US and $55,000 in foreign markets. Following its second run, the film made a profit of $163,000. Due to its perceived failure, Hawks was released early from his two-film contract with RKO and Gunga Din was eventually directed by George Stevens. Hawks later said the film [...] "had a great fault and I learned an awful lot from that. There were no normal people in it. <b>Everyone</b> <b>you</b> met was a screwball and since that time I learned my lesson and don't intend ever again to make everybody crazy". The director went on to work with RKO on three films over the next decade. Long before Bringing Up Babys release, Hepburn had been branded [...] "box-office poison" [...] by Harry Brandt (president of the Independent Theatre Owners of America) and thus was allowed to buy out her RKO contract for $22,000. However, many critics marveled at her new skill at low comedy; Life magazine called her [...] "the surprise of the picture". Hepburn's former boyfriend Howard Hughes bought RKO in 1941, and sold it in 1959; when he sold the company, Hughes retained the copyright to six films (including Bringing Up Baby).|$|E

Edwards addressed his parents from the podium: [...] "You taught me the values that I carry in my heart: faith, family, responsibility, opportunity for <b>everyone.</b> <b>You</b> taught me that there's dignity and honor in a hard day's work.

2500|$|Lady Diana was {{the most}} famous of the group, which {{included}} Raymond Asquith (son of H. H. Asquith, the Prime Minister), Patrick Shaw-Stewart, Edward Horner, Sir Denis Anson and Duff Cooper. [...] Following the deaths at relatively young ages of Asquith, Horner, Shaw-Stewart, and Anson—the first three in the war; Anson by drowning—Lady Diana married Cooper, one of her circle of friends' last surviving male members, in June 1919. It was not a popular choice in the Manners household, since the bride's parents had hoped for a marriage to the Prince of Wales. As for Cooper, he once impulsively wrote a letter to Lady Diana, before their marriage, declaring, [...] "I hope <b>everyone</b> <b>you</b> like better than me will die very soon." [...] In 1929 she gave birth to her only child, John Julius (now known as John Julius Norwich), who became a writer and broadcaster.|$|E
2500|$|Another strong {{theme from}} {{the album is}} peer pressure, {{particularly}} due to the band's part-Christian-part-mainstream status. The song [...] "Gravity" [...] refers to the opposing influences of Heaven and the secular world pulling the band in opposite directions, whilst [...] "Metamorphis" [...] further explores [...] "the fact that out in the world, although {{everybody wants to be}} their own selves, we're pulled this way and that. <b>Everyone</b> <b>you</b> meet wants you to be something or another. The song asks God to help us to be our own true selves, as God sees us, not the way folk pressure us to be what they want us to be." [...] "Bliss" [...] deals with accusations of selling out; in the words of Stu G, [...] "we know exactly where we want to go, we want to take our music to the world and have it recognized as being as good as anything that's out there. But we're not going to compromise or back away from our integrity as Christians." ...|$|E

This was only released at the band's two night show at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery on June 14 and 15.

2500|$|In 2002, Executive Producer Louise Berridge {{decided to}} {{reintroduce}} the character 8 {{years after she}} had last appeared. Auditions were held to cast the role to a professional actor; however, auditionees were not informed which character they were auditioning for. The first audition was a group workshop of 30 auditionees, who were asked to perform improvisations. After whittling down potential actors from 500 to 4, {{the second stage of}} the audition process was an interview with EastEnders Casting Director. The auditionees were asked to perform a monologue {{in front of a camera}} and do a screen test with one of the actors already in the show, Christopher Parker, who played Spencer Moon. 17-year-old actress Scarlett Johnson was cast: [...] "At the second audition they gave me a monologue to read, but they'd been really careful about it. They hadn't said what the character's name was, they didn't give away anything in the monologue that might tell me who I was auditioning for. So I didn't know until I got the part who I was going to be playing--I'd been guessing for ages!" [...] Asked how she felt when she knew she was playing Vicki Fowler, a character linked to the show's early history who is the daughter of 2 prominent original characters, Johnson said: [...] "I felt very honoured, but it was quite scary. I knew there'd be a lot of people out there with expectations of what she'd be like. But it's good fun actually. It means you don't have to introduce yourself to <b>everyone.</b> <b>You</b> can really play with that [...] My family are EastEnders addicts, we've watched it our whole lives. I remember the first Vicki, I remember Michelle and I definitely remember Dirty Den! My knowledge of the show really helped a lot, because I didn't have to do any research into the character. When I joined the show, I felt like I was meeting the actors for a second time. I'd already met them in my home on TV, then I had to actually meet them in real life!" [...] The character made her reappearance in January 2003, turning up unexpectedly at her grandmother Pauline's (Wendy Richard) house.|$|E

60|$|It puzzled my aunt that I {{did not go}} westward, {{where it}} was country-side and often quite pretty, with hedgerows and fields and copses and flowers. But always I went eastward, where in a long valley industrialism smokes and sprawls. That was the stuff to which I turned by nature, to the human effort, and the {{accumulation}} and jar of men's activities. And in such a country as that valley social and economic relations were simple and manifest. Instead of the limitless confusion of London's population, in which no man can trace any but the most slender correlation between rich and poor, in which everyone seems disconnected and adrift from <b>everyone,</b> <b>you</b> can see here the works, the potbank or the ironworks or what not, and here close at hand the congested, meanly-housed workers, and at a little distance a small middle-class quarter, and again remoter, the big house of the employer.

6000|$|From {{that first}} day forth, however, {{in spite of this}} beginning, Lord Southminster almost persecuted me with his {{persistent}} attentions. He did all a fellah could possibly do to please me. I could not make out precisely what he was driving at; but I saw he had some artful game of his own to play, and that he was playing it subtly. I also saw that, vapid as he was, his vapidity did not prevent him from being worldly wise with the wisdom of the self-seeking man of the world, who utterly distrusts and disbelieves in all the higher emotions of humanity. He harped so often on this string that on our second day out, as we lolled on deck in the heat, I had to rebuke him sharply. He had been sneering for some hours. 'There are two kinds of silly simplicity, Lord Southminster,' I said, at last. 'One kind is the silly simplicity of the rustic who trusts everybody; the other kind is the silly simplicity of the Pall Mall clubman who trusts nobody. It is just as foolish and just as one-sided to overlook the good as to overlook the evil in humanity. If you trust <b>everyone,</b> <b>you</b> are likely to be taken in; but if you trust no one, you put yourself at a serious practical disadvantage, besides losing half the joy of living.' ...|$|E

Nobody gives me anything. When I was only an Archduchess, the English ambassador used to give me money whenever I wanted it--or rather whenever he wanted to get anything out of my sacred predecessor Elizabeth [the Court bows to the ground]; but now that I am Empress he never gives me a kopek.
