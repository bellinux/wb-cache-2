The model is based on an indicator framework for analysing Indigenous disadvantage developed by the Productivity Commission (2003), in which <b>headline</b> <b>indicators</b> identify multiple areas of disadvantage and strategic change indicators represent possible causes of disadvantage which can be targeted by policy makers. The impact on <b>headline</b> <b>indicators</b> of strategic change indicators and other possible causal variables is estimated by a system of simultaneous equations using data from the 2002 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey (NATSISS). A variety of econometric techniques have been employed including the use of replicate weights, due to the complex survey design of NATSISS, and bivariate probit and control function approaches to control for endogeneity bias. Estimation results are discussed in terms of the significance and marginal effects of explanatory variables on each <b>headline</b> <b>indicator</b> of Indigenous disadvantage. The results demonstrate the key causes of Indigenous disadvantage and the interdependence of indicators.

40|$|This paper, which {{represents}} the living standards domain of the new Canadian Index of Wellbeing, provides a comprehensive overview of trends {{in a number of}} indicators of living standards over the 1981 - 2008 period in Canada. Part one examines trends in average and median income and wealth indicators in Canada. Part two looks at the distribution of the income and wealth of Canadians over time, including trends in poverty. Part three discusses trends in income fluctuations or volatility. Part four analyzes trends in the economic security of Canadians, including labour market security, food security, housing security, and the security provided by the social safety net. The report also presents a synthesis of overall trends in living standards, discusses living standard measurement issues, and puts forward a set of <b>headline</b> <b>indicators</b> to capture the essentials of what has been happening to the living standards of Canadians. Finally, the report comments on the sustainability of current levels of living standards. The report provides a comprehensive examination {{of a large number of}} indicators of living standards in Canada over the last quarter century and has identified a number of these <b>indicators</b> as <b>headline</b> <b>indicators</b> for the new Canadian Index of Wellbeing. The bottom line is that Canada has become a much richer country, but the top quintile has received the lion’s share of rising income and wealth. Looking at the nine <b>headline</b> <b>indicators</b> for which time series are available, one can immediately see that living standards of Canadians have not unambiguously improved between 1981 and 2008. Indeed, Canadians experienced a widening of income and wealth inequalities. There have been poverty reductions, but the reductions were not nearly as large as the increase in wealth inequality. The unemployment rate is down to a record low for the 1981 - 2008 period, and yet the incidence of long-term unemployment is higher now than in 1981. Economic security measured by the CSLS index has also fallen, spurred by a significant decrease in economic security caused by the financial risk associated with illness. Since 1981, many dimensions of living standards in Canada have not improved, and that in spite of a 52. 6 per cent surge in gross domestic product per capita. Looking forward, the challenges for Canada’s policymakers are significant, but need to be tackled if Canada is to become a fairer, healthier and richer country.

40|$|The {{scientific}} community currently {{deals with the}} challenge of measuring sustainable development by using long lists of core set indicator. These are then used in one of two ways: either shortened sets of <b>headline</b> <b>indicators</b> are selected (these vary by sector or theme), or an aggregation procedure is adopted that allows the creation of unique integrated indices, such as the well known ISEW, HDI, PPI. Recent work has demonstrated that most countries prefer to develop their own approaches over and above the accepted international standards, in some cases adapting these standard approaches, whilst seeking to strike a delicate balance between, on the one hand, globally accepted environmental and socio-economic indicators and, on the other, national and local peculiarities. The imperative in such cases is to avoid losing international comparability. The choice must take account of the varying space and time scales of each country with regard to sustainable development, as well as the role of the national policymakers in selecting the approach to sustainability. This paper introduces the ISSI index which is based on three baskets: welfare, environmental quality and resource use each one defined by a limited set of <b>headline</b> <b>indicators.</b> A combination algorithm is then proposed which gives a global, integrated non-dimensional index, which allows comparisons between the Italian regions as well as between countries. A multidimensional vector presentation tool is introduced that allows the trends of each index component, as well as the index as a whole to be monitored.

40|$|Community {{indicators}} {{are used to}} assess the state of ecological communities and to guide management. They are usually calculated from monitoring data, often collected annually. Since any given community indicator provides a univariate summary of complex multivariate phenomena, different changes in the community may lead to the same response in the indicator. Sampling variation can also mask ecologically important trends. This study addresses these challenges for community indicators, with a focus on the large fish indicator (LFI), internationally used to report status of marine fish communities. The LFI expresses ‘large’ fish biomass as a proportion of total fish biomass and is calculated from species–size–abundance data collected on trawl surveys. We develop new methods to decompose the contributions of species, sampling locations and season to trends over time in the LFI, and highlight consequences for assessment and management. Our results showed that both species and locations made divergent contributions to overall trends in the LFI indicator, with contributions differing by several orders of magnitude and in sign. Only small proportions of species and locations drove overall LFI trends, and their contributions changed with season (spring and autumn surveys). To assess significance of component trends, a resampling method was developed. Our method can be generalized and applied to many other community indicators based on survey data. Synthesis and applications. Our new method for decomposing community indicators and generating confidence intervals makes it possible to extract much more information on what drives a ‘headline’ indicator, providing a solution to challenges arising from multiple possible interpretations of changes in the indicator and from sampling variation. Analysis of the effects of <b>indicator</b> components on <b>headline</b> <b>indicator</b> values is recommended, because the results allow assessors and managers to identify and interpret how divergent factors (e. g. species, sampling locations and seasons) contribute to the <b>headline</b> <b>indicator</b> value...|$|R
