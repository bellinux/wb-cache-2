5|$|Enrollment dropped {{every year}} since the program's {{inception}} such that, when compounded by dropouts, the program was below half-capacity three years later. UW President Glenn Frank had warned of decreased enrollment in August 1928 and of its consequences for the college. UW College of Letters and Science Dean George Sellery offered support conditional on codified discipline and uniform final exams, which Meiklejohn refused. Sellery later refused to allow transfer students into the college. Meiklejohn wrote letters to Wisconsin high schools in April 1929 that acknowledged the college's stereotypes and welcomed demographic change, but the campaign backfired. He sent an adviser to tour the state and solve {{what he saw as}} a communication issue. The adviser found <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>seniors</b> largely interested in vocational training, and that the prospect of traditional college excited students {{to the point where they}} did not consider improvements upon that model. The adviser found students uninterested in the Experimental College's prospects.|$|E
