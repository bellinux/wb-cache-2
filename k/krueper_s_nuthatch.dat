The {{position of the}} beautiful nuthatch within the genus was not established with certainty, having a far lower statistical association than others in the model. Nevertheless, under the findings the species appears closest evolutionarily to three clades of nuthatches: two nuthatches that prefer rocky environments, the western rock <b>nuthatch</b> (<b>S.</b> neumayer) and the eastern rock <b>nuthatch</b> (<b>S.</b> tephronota); species in the [...] "europaea" [...] group, including the Eurasian <b>nuthatch</b> (<b>S.</b> europaea), Siberian <b>nuthatch</b> (<b>S.</b> arctica), chestnut-vented <b>nuthatch</b> (<b>S.</b> nagaensis), Kashmir <b>nuthatch</b> (<b>S.</b> cashmirensis), Indian <b>nuthatch</b> (<b>S.</b> castanea), chestnut-bellied <b>nuthatch</b> (<b>S.</b> cinnamoventris) and the Burmese <b>nuthatch</b> (<b>S.</b> neglecta); {{as well as the}} white-tailed <b>nuthatch</b> (<b>S.</b> himalayensis), and therefore, the white-browed <b>nuthatch</b> (<b>S.</b> victoriae). These close relatives are generally all species that plaster the entrance to their nest with mud.|$|R

5000|$|Within {{the genus}} the Corsican {{nuthatch}} {{belongs to the}} canadensis group which also includes the red-breasted <b>nuthatch</b> (<b>S.</b> canadensis), the Chinese <b>nuthatch</b> (<b>S.</b> villosa), Krüper's <b>nuthatch</b> (<b>S.</b> krueperi) and the Algerian <b>nuthatch</b> (<b>S.</b> ledanti). [...] These six species usually excavate their own nests and all except the Algerian nuthatch specialize in extracting seeds from pine cones. All {{members of the group}} also exhibit sexually dimorphism in the colour of their head feathers. Analysis of ribosomal and mitochondrial DNA indicated that the Corsican nuthatch is most closely related to the Chinese nuthatch and that they diverged from a common ancestor around 0.96 million years ago. [...] The large distance separating the ranges of the two sister species is very unusual for Palaearctic passerines. The Yunnan nuthatch is a sister species to the canadensis group and has many common features.|$|R

The {{position of the}} blue nuthatch within the genus was not established with certainty, having a far lower statistical association than many others in the model.

These tropical Asian nuthatches are themselves a sister clade to one comprising the subgenus Sitta (Micrositta) (sometimes called the canadensis group), plus the brown-headed <b>nuthatch</b> (<b>S.</b> pusilla) and the pygmy <b>nuthatch</b> (<b>S.</b> pygmaea).|$|R
5000|$|The blue {{nuthatch}} {{was first}} described in 1830 under its current binomial name, Sitta azurea, by the French naturalist René Primevère Lesson (1794-1849). In 2006, ornithologist Edward C. Dickinson proposed {{a revision of}} the nuthatch genus, in which certain species would be split off into separate genera, based on distinct morphological traits. He suggested as candidates the velvet-fronted nuthatch (Sitta frontalis) and the blue nuthatch, the morphology of which he describes as [...] "rather aberrant ... {{in spite of a}} character trait (white edges to wing feathers) shared with Sitta formosa", and that doing so might, in turn, require S. Formosa (the beautiful nuthatch) to be split off as well. He stated, however, that a molecular study would be warranted prior to any re-classification. * Weakly-supported clade** *** **** Brown-headed <b>nuthatch</b> (<b>S.</b> pusilla)**** [...] Pygmy <b>nuthatch</b> (<b>S.</b> pygmaea)*** [...] canadensis group** *** Blue <b>nuthatch</b> (<b>S.</b> azurea)*** **** Velvet-fronted <b>nuthatch</b> (<b>S.</b> frontalis)**** [...] Sulphur-billed <b>nuthatch</b> (<b>S.</b> oenochlamys) ...|$|R
25|$|Three {{subspecies}} are distinguished: S. a. expectata, S. a. nigriventer and S. a. azurea, which vary chiefly in the coloring {{of their}} mantles, chests and bellies. The species' apparent closest relatives are the velvet-fronted <b>nuthatch</b> (<b>S.</b> frontalis), the yellow-billed <b>nuthatch</b> (<b>S.</b> solangiae) and the sulphur-billed <b>nuthatch</b> (<b>S.</b> oenochlamys).

5|$|Nuthatch {{taxonomy}} is complex, with geographically separated species sometimes closely resembling each other. The white-breasted nuthatch has {{an appearance}} and contact call {{similar to those}} of the white-cheeked nuthatch, Sitta leucopsis, of the Himalayas and was formerly considered to be conspecific with it. A study published in 2012 showed that four distinct lineages were genetically isolated from each other and could represent different species, recognizable by morphology and song. A molecular phylogeny published in 2014 and including all main species' lineages within nuthatches concluded that the white-breasted nuthatch was more closely related to the giant <b>nuthatch</b> (<b>S.</b> magna) than to S. przewalskii, formerly regarded as possibly conspecific with it; S. przewalskii turned out to be basal in the family.|$|R
5|$|The Eurasian, chestnut-vented, Kashmir and chestnut-bellied nuthatches form another {{superspecies}} {{and replace}} each other geographically across Asia. They are currently {{considered to be}} four separate species, but the south-Asian forms were once {{believed to be a}} subspecies of the Eurasian nuthatch. A recent change in this taxonomy is a split of the chestnut-bellied nuthatch into three species, namely the Indian nuthatch, Sitta castanea, found south of the Ganges, the Burmese nuthatch, Sitta neglecta, found in southeast Asia, and the chestnut-bellied <b>nuthatch</b> sensu stricto, <b>S.</b> cinnamoventris, which occurs in the Himalayas. Mitochondrial DNA studies have demonstrated that the white-breasted northern subspecies of Eurasian <b>nuthatch,</b> <b>S.</b> (europea) arctica, is distinctive, and also a possible candidate for full species status. This split has been accepted by the British Ornithologists' Union.|$|R
500|$|In 2014, Eric Pasquet, et al. {{published}} a phylogeny based on examination of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of 21 <b>nuthatch</b> species. Though <b>S.</b> leucopsis {{was not included}} in the study, it found that within the <b>nuthatch</b> group covered, <b>S.</b> przewalskii is basal—an ancestor at the base (or root)—to the nuthatch evolutionary family tree, and thus [...] "sister to all other nuthatches, without any close relatives". The findings resulted from phylogenetic analyses (employing Bayesian inference and the maximum likelihood methods). A biogeographical analysis (using the dispersal-extinction–cladogenesis model) was then performed. The cladogram drawn from the evidence indicates that the first clade and closest descendants of Przevalski's nuthatch are the North American white-breasted nuthatch and the giant <b>nuthatch</b> (<b>S.</b> magna), dispelling the hypothesis that S. przewalskii could belong to the same species as S. carolinensis.|$|R
40|$|This {{winter was}} {{generally}} unremarkable {{except for the}} occurrence of good numbers of several species at {{the western edge of}} the state, notably Clark 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> Nutcracker, Pygmy <b>Nuthatch,</b> and Bohemian Waxwing. There were a couple of sightings of Mountain Chickadee and one of Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Finch for good measure. All of the winter finches on the Nebraska list (except for Hoary Redpoll) appeared, most notably Pine Grosbeak, represented by two birds. One of these was in the southwest (Kansas had several reports) but the other was in the east, suggesting either multiple points of origin, or, as suggested by some in Kansas, northern rather than western origin. Also in good numbers were Red-breasted Nuthatches, but Harris 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrows were scarce. Black-capped Chickadees remained in very low numbers in southern Nebraska west of the Missouri River Valley. Of interest was the discovery of wintering Marsh and Winter Wrens along the central Niobrara Valley; perhaps this is a regular occurrence, but who 2 ̆ 7 s been looking? This phenomenon may be linked to other occurrences that would be expected in a warmer winter: several species of ducks that are generally not seen in midwinter were found on the Scottsbluff and Gering Sewage Lagoons, sapsuckers were in good numbers, catbirds and Brown Thrashers put in unexpected winter appearances, and a Loggerhead Shrike was far to the north. Notable sightings were several, ranging from huge counts to birds rare in winter but expected at other times to bona fide rarities, although the last is a matter of one 2 ̆ 7 s definition of rare. Best sightings in these categories were probably the 2, 000, 000 Snow Geese reported (half the North American population), 4 Barrow 2 ̆ 7 s Goldeneyes, a financially savvy Sharp-tailed Grouse, a first-documented Dec Osprey, 3 rd-latest Least Sandpipers, Great Black-backed and lceland Gulls, first winter record for White-winged Dove, 9568 crows and 10, 216 robins at Calamus Res, White-winged Crossbill, and, of course, 2 Pine Grosbeaks...|$|R
