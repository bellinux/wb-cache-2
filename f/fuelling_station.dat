40|$|Hydrogen {{produced}} from low-emission primary energy sources, particularly renewable energy, {{is a potential}} alternative transport fuel to gasoline and diesel that can contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving global energy security. Hydrogen <b>fuelling</b> <b>stations</b> {{are one of the}} most important parts of the distribution infrastructure required to support the operation of hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles and hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicles. If there is to be substantial market penetration of hydrogen vehicles in the transport sector, the introduction of commercial hydrogen vehicles and the network of <b>fuelling</b> <b>stations</b> to supply them with hydrogen must take place simultaneously. The present paper thus reviews the current state of the art and deployment of hydrogen <b>fuelling</b> <b>stations.</b> It is found that by 2013, there were 224 working hydrogen stations distributed over 28 countries. Some 43 % of these stations were located in North and South America, 34 % in Europe, 23 % in Asia, and none in Australia. The state of the art in the range of hydrogen production processes is briefly reviewed. The importance of producing hydrogen using renewable energy sources is emphasised for a transition to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles to contribute to greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. 2. 3 - 5. 8 /H 2 kg for SMR A classification of hydrogen refuelling stations is introduced, based on the primary energy source used to produce the hydrogen, the production process, and whether the hydrogen is made on site or delivered to the site. The current state of deployment of hydrogen <b>fuelling</b> <b>stations</b> in each major region of the world is then reviewed in detail. The costs of producing hydrogen vary from $ 1. 8 to 2. 9 /H 2 kg for Coal gasification, 2. 3 - 5. 8 /H 2 kg for SMR, $ 6 - 7. 4 /H 2 kg for wind power and $ 6. 3 - 25. 4 /H 2 kg depending on the cost of the PV system. The lowest cost of hydrogen is nearing competitiveness with petroleum fuels...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIf the 'Hydrogen Economy' is to progress, more {{hydrogen}} <b>fuelling</b> <b>stations</b> are required. In {{the short}} term {{and in the absence}} of a hydrogen distribution network, these <b>fuelling</b> <b>stations</b> will have to be supplied by liquid hydrogen (LH 2) road tankers. Such a development will increase the number of tanker offloading operations significantly and these may need to be performed in close proximity to the general public. The aim of this work was to determine the hazards and severity of a realistic ignited spill of LH 2 focussing on; flammability limits of an LH 2 vapour cloud, flame speeds through an LH 2 vapour cloud and subsequent radiative heat levels after ignition. The experimental findings presented are split into three phenomena; jet-fires in high and low wind conditions, 'burn-back' of ignited clouds and secondary explosions 7 post 'burn-back'. An attempt was made to estimate the magnitude of an explosion that occurred during one of the releases. The resulting data were used to propose safety distances for LH 2 offloading facilities which will help to update and develop guidance for codes and standards...|$|R

50|$|Initially named a coaling station {{due to the}} use of coal for steam {{generation}} a <b>fuelling</b> <b>station</b> was built for the purpose of replenishing coal supplies for ships or railway locomotives. The term is often associated with 19th and early 20th century seaports associated with blue water navies, who used coaling stations as a means of extending the range of warships. In the late 19th century steamships powered by coal began to replace sailing ships as the principal means of propulsion for ocean transport. Fueling stations transitioned to oil as boilers moved from being coal-fired to oil- or hybrid oil-and-coal-firing, coal being completely replaced as steam engines gave way to internal combustion and gas turbine power plants.|$|E
