50|$|Functional job {{analysis}} (FJA) {{is a classic}} example of a task-oriented technique. Developed by Fine and Cronshaw in 1944, work elements are scored in terms of relatedness to data (0-6), people (0-8), and things (0-6), with lower scores representing greater complexity. Incumbents, considered subject matter experts (SMEs), are relied upon, usually in a panel, to report elements of their work to the <b>job</b> <b>analyst.</b> Using incumbent reports, the analyst uses Fine's terminology to compile statements reflecting the work being performed in terms of data, people, and things. The Dictionary of Occupational Titles uses elements of the FJA in defining jobs.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} job {{analysis}} involves the analyst describing {{the duties of}} the incumbent, then the nature and conditions of work, and finally some basic qualifications. After this, the <b>job</b> <b>analyst</b> has completed a form called a job psychograph, which displays the mental requirements of the job. The measure of a sound job analysis is a valid task list. This list contains the functional or duty areas of a position, the related tasks, and the basic training recommendations. Subject matter experts (incumbents) and supervisors for the position being analyzed need to validate this final list in order to validate the job analysis.|$|E
30|$|The data {{contained}} in the DOT was collected by trained <b>job</b> <b>analysts</b> in ETA field offices across the United States based on their observations and interviews at selected <b>job</b> sites. <b>Job</b> <b>analysts</b> visited workplaces on a continuous basis and each new edition of the DOT replaced existing scores with the new scores collected in the intervening period.|$|R

40|$|Several {{methods for}} {{improving}} the job analysis process were examined using the Position Analysis Questionnaire (PAQ). Holistic ratings of PAQ dimensions for four jobs were obtained from 63 non-experts, nine graduate students who {{were familiar with the}} PAQ, and three professional <b>job</b> <b>analysts</b> who were very familiar with the PAQ. Holistic ratings were compared to a traditional score profile obtained from professional <b>job</b> <b>analysts.</b> For all groups, holistic ratings of the dimensions were not similar to the traditional score profiles; consequently, rating PAQ dimensions holistically is probably not a viable alternative to reducing the effort required in the job analysis process. Additionally, a comparison of three rating scales in the holistic condition showed that they were moderately correlated. Future research investigating rating scales that yield independent information should be conducted. The potential benefits of a detailed item training session for <b>job</b> <b>analysts</b> are also discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Position Analysis Questionnaire: The Position Analysis Questionnaire (PAQ) is a {{well-known}} job analysis instrument. Although it is labeled a questionnaire, the PAQ is actually designed {{to be completed by}} a trained <b>job</b> <b>analyst</b> who interviews the SMEs (e.g., job incumbents and their supervisors).2 The PAQ was designed to measure job component validity of attributes presented in aptitude tests. Job component validity is the relationship between test scores and skills required for good job performance. There are 195 behavior-related statements in the PAQ divided into six major sections: information input, mental process, work output, relationships with others, job context, and other job characteristics.|$|E
50|$|Task-oriented {{procedures}} {{focus on}} the actual activities involved in performing work. This procedure takes into consideration work duties, responsibilities, and functions. The <b>job</b> <b>analyst</b> then develops task statements which clearly state the tasks that are performed with great detail. After creating task statements, job analysts rate the tasks on scales indicating importance, difficulty, frequency, and consequences of error. Based on these ratings, {{a greater sense of}} understanding of a job can be attained. Task analysis, such as cognitively oriented task analysis (COTA), are techniques used to describe job expertise. For example, the job analysts may tour the job site and observe workers performing their jobs. During the tour the analyst may collect materials that directly or indirectly indicate required skills (duty statements, instructions, safety manuals, quality charts, etc.).|$|E
40|$|IDENTIFIERS *Air Force The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{evaluate}} and improve the job inventory method of job analysis as applied to officer positions. Seven utilization fields were analyzed and inventories were constructed for another three fields. The basic finding was that the inventory method can be used operationally in the analysis of officer jobs if job analysts use specific approaches to task statement construction and if more front-end research than is usually needed for airman job inventories is performed prior to the finalization of a job inventory. No magic formulas for the construction of task statements exist; however, after heavy front-end work, the <b>job</b> <b>analyst</b> will obtain enough information to resolve the issues of task specificity and breadth of coverage for each utilization field on an individual basis. The report contains 3...|$|E
30|$|Variables on the Abilities {{questionnaire}} {{seem particularly}} prone to this problem. Questions originally intended for completion by job incumbents carry names like “fluency of ideas”, “category flexibility”, “speed of closure” and “rate control”. The instrument contained so many technical terms {{that it was}} assigned to <b>job</b> <b>analysts</b> to complete rather than workers once final data collection began (Donsbach et al. 2003). The Skills questionnaire, which was completed by workers in O*NET’s first 5 -year cycle, was also transferred to <b>job</b> <b>analysts</b> in 2008 because of the cognitive difficulties its items created for respondents.|$|R
50|$|Patrick and Moore have {{revised the}} PAQ and {{developed}} a couple of changes called Job Structure Profile (JSP). JSP included item content style and new items to increase the discriminatory of the decision making dimension. This method {{is designed to be}} used more by <b>job</b> <b>analysts</b> than by <b>job</b> incumbents. Another alternative to the position analysis questionnaire, the Job Element Inventory (JEI), was developed by Cornelius and Hackel in 1978. It is very similar to the traditional PAQ, but is constructed to be easier to read for incumbents, <b>job</b> <b>analysts</b> and applicants.|$|R
3000|$|The first {{complete}} O*NET cycle {{produced a}} database of 239 items across seven surveys mailed to employers for workers to complete and an additional questionnaire assigned to <b>job</b> <b>analysts</b> because the questions proved too abstract for job incumbents to answer (U.S. Department of Labor 2005, pp. A- 4, A- 9). The incumbent questionnaires are titled Education and Training, Knowledge, Work Activities, Work Context, Work Styles, and Skills. A small sample of <b>job</b> <b>analysts</b> complete the Abilities questionnaire based on written job descriptions and in 2008 assumed responsibility for the Skills questionnaire from job incumbents, creating a break in this series. These questionnaires cover different but sometimes overlapping substantive domains. 1 [...]...|$|R
40|$|In general, well-educated people enjoy better {{mental health}} than those with less education. As a result, some wonder whether {{there are limits to}} the mental health {{benefits}} of education. Inspired by the literature on the expansion of tertiary education, this article explores marginal mental health returns to education and studies the mental health status of overeducated people. To enhance the validity of the findings we use two indicators of educational attainment - years of education and ISCED 97 categories - and two objective indicators of overeducation (the realised matches method and the <b>job</b> <b>analyst</b> method) in a sample of the working population of 25 European countries (unweighted sample N= 19, 089). Depression is measured using an eight-item version of the CES-D scale. We find diminishing mental health returns to education. In addition, overeducated people report more depression symptoms. Both findings hold irrespective of the indicators used. The results must be interpreted {{in the light of the}} enduring expansion of education, as our findings show that the discussion of the relevance of the human capital perspective, and the diploma disease view on the relationship between education and modern society, is not obsolete...|$|E
40|$|Although {{research}} {{has tried to}} lessen the cognitive burden for <b>job</b> <b>analysts</b> by decomposing the decision process, findings have been ambiguous. This ambiguity may stem from overlooking the idea that analyzing jobs involves intuitive processes that decomposing hinders, at least if the <b>job</b> <b>analysts</b> have much <b>job</b> experience (i. e., job incumbents). Furthermore, job incumbents’ intuition might be particularly advantageous if complex items are used. Focusing on the job of paramedics, we found that incumbents’ ratings were more accurate than laypersons’ ratings if the job was presented holistically, whereas laypersons were more accurate when the job was decomposed. Results also showed an analogous Job Experience × Item Complexity interaction. These findings indicate {{that the role of}} intuition for analyzing jobs deserves more attention...|$|R
30|$|Many of {{the items}} {{themselves}} are vague, overly complex, and jargon-laden. O*NET has recognized this fact implicitly in transferring responsibility for completing the Abilities and Skills questionnaires from incumbents to <b>job</b> <b>analysts,</b> who receive written information on the occupations they rate but do not make workplace site visits.|$|R
30|$|A third {{method is}} to define the norm by using job analysis. Professional <b>job</b> <b>analysts</b> {{determine}} the educational requirements for a job and the individual’s educational attainment is compared to this. A fourth method is worker self-assessment where workers are asked in surveys about the educational requirements of their job.|$|R
30|$|However, {{analyst and}} {{supervisor}} ratings also have potential problems, such as less {{intimate knowledge of}} jobs than the job-holders themselves, and biases such as halo effects or stereotyping. 6 In practice, <b>job</b> <b>analysts</b> themselves usually derive much of their data from interviews with incumbents, though they combine this information with their own and others’ observations and judgment, as well.|$|R
30|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{matching}} jobseekers to vacancies, skill requirements need {{to be far more}} detailed. This is usually done by professional <b>job</b> <b>analysts,</b> who analyse skill requirements in job advertisements, study realised job matches, or undertake company studies of required skills. However, this method typically addresses a selected set of occupations and does not cover all occupations in a national labour market, as the latter is a huge undertaking.|$|R
50|$|<b>Job</b> <b>analysts</b> are {{typically}} industrial-organizational (I-O) psychologists or human resource officers {{who have been}} trained by, and are acting {{under the supervision of}} an I-O psychologist. One of the first I-O psychologists to introduce job analysis was Morris Viteles. In 1922, he used job analysis in order to select employees for a trolley car company. Viteles' techniques could then be applied to any other area of employment using the same process.|$|R

30|$|Responding to methodological {{criticisms of}} the DOT {{and the costs of}} {{in-person}} job analysis, the Advisory Panel for the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (APDOT) was created in 1990 to consider alternatives. APDOT recommended {{the creation of a new}} system to replace the DOT, subsequently named the Occupational Information Network (O*NET), which would use standardized surveys of a representative sample of job incumbents instead of <b>job</b> <b>analysts</b> conducting workplace interviews and observations (U.S. Department of Labor 1993; Peterson et al. 1999, pp. 297 f.; Peterson et al. 2001).|$|R
30|$|Thus, {{information}} on job tasks {{are provided by}} <b>job</b> <b>analysts</b> instead of being based on self-reports of job holders, as in Gathmann and Schönberg (2010) and Spitz-Oener (2006). As argued by Handel (2016), job incumbents may overestimate their self-reports, whereas analysts usually have less close knowledge of jobs than do the employees themselves. This latter problem could be mitigated {{in the case of}} CBO, as panel members are themselves workers in the occupation, although they probably hold higher positions, as outstanding workers, which could also affect their evaluations.|$|R

Eighty-one taxi drivers, 18 taxi company managers, and 18 HRM students who acted as <b>job</b> <b>analysts</b> were randomly arranged in 3 -person group discussion directed by critical incident technique. ANOVA results indicated that: a) anchored clues made subjects provide less complete information; b) homogeneity of incumbents resulted in extremity shift then information incompleteness; and c) social desirability hypothesis was not supported.

50|$|The Dictionary of Occupational Titles or D-O-T (DOT) {{refers to}} a {{publication}} produced by the United States Department of Labor which helped employers, government officials, and workforce development professionals to define over 13,000 different types of work, from 1938 to the late 1990s. The DOT was created by <b>job</b> <b>analysts</b> who visited thousands of US worksites to observe and record {{the various types of}} work, and what was involved. Innovative at the time, the DOT included information still used today in settling EEO and Workers Comp claims, like the physical abilities required to perform that occupation, and the time and repetitiveness of those physical actions (i.e. standing, sitting, lifting 20 pounds or more, seeing at a distance, near vision, hearing quiet sounds, ignoring loud sounds).|$|R
30|$|O*NET resurveys occupations on a {{continuous}} basis in a 5 -year cycle so another completely {{new set of}} ratings became available in 2013. This has great potential utility for researchers interested in capturing within-occupation skill change, which was not possible with the DOT. However, researchers will need to exercise caution because the project is not organized specifically for research purposes and new ratings simply replace old ratings for each set of occupations {{on a rolling basis}} rather than updating all ratings for each new edition. In addition, one skills section previously completed by job-holders is now completed by <b>job</b> <b>analysts</b> who make judgment-based ratings using written job descriptions, rather than site visits. The values of these O*NET variables cannot be assumed to be comparable to prior values derived from incumbent self-reports.|$|R
3000|$|One {{potential}} {{limitation of}} the STAMP approach {{is that it is}} based on self-reports of job incumbents, which may be upwardly biased compared to trained job analysts’ judgments. Employees may inflate self-reports due to self-presentation motives and restricted frames of reference. When a worker rates their job’s level of autonomy, for example, {{they are more likely to}} be making comparisons to jobs relatively close to their own, rather than considering where their job falls relative to the entire spectrum of jobs in the economy. Indeed, research finds incumbents generally give their jobs more positive ratings than <b>job</b> <b>analysts</b> or other external observers, such as supervisors, though the two sets of ratings are usually, though not always, correlated and the differences between incumbents and observers are not always large. 5 [...]...|$|R

30|$|There are {{at least}} a dozen {{questions}} on general cognitive ability (α[*]=[*] 0.97), such as analytical thinking, critical thinking, analyzing data or information, deductive reasoning, and inductive reasoning. 2 Although distinctions among these concepts may be clear to psychologists who work with these constructs, they are likely lost on respondents and perhaps even some <b>job</b> <b>analysts</b> rating occupations on the Abilities instrument. Informal inspections of correlations between these items also suggests there may be survey effects, i.e., correlations seem lower between items from different surveys with relatively close meanings compared to correlations between items from the same survey with less similar meanings. In other words, there may be a tendency for respondents to respond in systematic ways to the items within a survey when they belong to the same domain, rather than responding to each item independently.|$|R

However, PAQ ratings in the Jones et al. study were not validated against an external standard, thereby making the unambiguous interpretation of their results impossible. To determine the convergent validity of the Jones et al. approach, we provided job-naive raters with varying amounts of job descriptive information and, in some cases, prior practice rating the job with another job analysis instrument; PAQ ratings were validated against those of <b>job</b> <b>analysts</b> who were also job content experts.

40|$|The {{first step}} in {{developing}} or updating a licensure or certification examination is to conduct a job or task analysis. Following completion of the job analysis, a survey validation study is performed to validate {{the results of the}} job analysis and to obtain task ratings so that an examination blueprint may be created. Psychometricians and <b>job</b> <b>analysts</b> have spent years arguing over the choice of scales that should be used to evaluate job tasks, as well as how those scales should be combined to create an examination blueprint. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the relationship between individual and composite rating scales, examine how that relationship varied across industries, sample sizes, task presentation order, and number of tasks rated, and evaluate whether examination blueprint weightings would differ based on the choice of scales or composites of scales used. Findings from this study should be used to guide psychometricians and <b>job</b> <b>analysts</b> in their choice of rating scales, choice of composites of rating scales, and how to create examination blueprints based upon individual and/or composite rating scales. A secondary data analysis was performed to help answer some of these questions. As part of the secondary data analysis, data from 20 survey validation studies performed during a five year period were analyzed. Correlations were computed between 29 pairings of individual and composite rating scales to see if there were redundancies in task ratings. Meta-analytic techniques were used to evaluate the relationship between each pairing of rating scales and to determine if the relationship between pairings of rating scales was impacted by several factors. Lastly, sample examination blueprints were created from several individual and composite rating scales to determine if the rating scales that were used to create the examination blueprints would ultimately impact the weighting of the examination blueprint. The results of this study suggest that there is a high degree of redundancy between certain pairs of scales (i. e., the Importance and Criticality rating scale are highly related), and a somewhat lower degree of redundancy between other rating scales; but that the same relationship between rating scales is observed across many variables, including the industry for which the job analysis was being performed. The results also suggest the choice of rating scales used to create examination blueprints does not have a large effect on the finalized examination blueprint. This finding is especially true if a composite rating scale is used to create the weighting on the examination blueprint...|$|R
30|$|Objections {{have been}} raised to all three methods. The first method is criticised because workers may be {{inclined}} to over- or understate the educational requirements of their job or simply to equate these requirements to their own level of education (Hartog and Jonker 1997). Furthermore, respondents may not always have a good insight into the level of education required to perform a job (Cohn and Khan 1995; Halaby 1994). The second method, the objective one, is criticised because skill requirements within a given occupation cannot vary (Halaby 1994). Based on a survey of school leavers, Van der Velden and van Smoorenburg (1997) conclude that <b>job</b> <b>analysts</b> systematically overestimate the level of required education, probably {{because they do not}} use the ‘real’ situation as the basis of their rating, but descriptions of the tasks and the nature and required level of knowledge and skills. The third method also ignores the variation in terms of educational requirements within an occupation. Additionally, the choice of the reference measure (mean, median or mode) and the choice of one standard deviation seem rather arbitrary (Halaby, 1994). Therefore, Hartog and Jonker (1997) and Verhaest and Omey (2006) conclude that this should be the least preferred method for determining overschooling.|$|R
