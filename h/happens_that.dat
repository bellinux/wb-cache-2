5|$|The Pandavas {{live under}} the guise of sadhus in a remote town. Bakasura is a very {{powerful}} monster who plagues the town. He blackmails them to send two oxen, a cartload of food and a human being everyday to quench his hunger. It so <b>happens</b> <b>that,</b> the house owners of the Pandavas get their turn to send the human being on that day. However, Kunti says that she would rather sacrifice her own son instead of their only one, since she has five children.|$|E
5|$|The vessels {{have four}} decks, upon {{which there are}} cabins and saloons for merchants. Several of these 'mysria' contain {{cupboards}} and other conveniences; they have doors which can be locked, and keys for their occupiers. (The merchants) take with them their wives and concubines. It often <b>happens</b> <b>that</b> a man can be in his cabin without others on board realizing it, {{and they do not}} see him until the vessel has arrived in some port. The sailors also have their children in such cabins; and (in some parts of the ship) they sew garden herbs, vegetables, and ginger in wooden tubs. The Commander of such a vessel is a great Emir; when he lands, the archers and the Ethiops (i.e. black slaves, yet in China these men-at-arms would have most likely been Malays) march before him bearing javelins and swords, with drums beating and trumpets blowing. When he arrives at the guesthouse where he is to stay, they set up their lances {{on each side of the}} gate, and mount guard throughout his visit.|$|E

25|$|Armstrong {{also argues}} that {{contradictory}} beliefs {{show that there is}} a connection between beliefs and knowledge. He gives the example of a woman who has learned her husband is dead but cannot bring herself to believe her husband is dead. She both believes and disbelieves her husband is dead: it just <b>happens</b> <b>that</b> one of her two beliefs is justified, true and satisfies some knowledge conditions.|$|E
25|$|However, chance plays a {{large role}} in Button Men; it is always {{possible}} for a 20-sided die to roll a 1 at an inopportune time. Among tournament legal buttons, at least, no match-up is impossible for either side to win. Inevitably it <b>happens</b> <b>that</b> a weaker Button Man or a less skilled player will claim some improbable victories due to lucky die rolls. This effect is offset somewhat, however, by the rule that a player must win three rounds to win a game.|$|E

25|$|The 'Ava Title {{is a name}} or names {{bestowed}} only {{on certain}} matai chiefs who also have an 'Ava Title inseparable from their chiefly title. The bestowal of an 'Ava title usually {{takes place at the}} same time a matai title is bestowed. It occasionally <b>happens</b> <b>that</b> the 'Ava title is bestowed first, but only after it has been determined that the chiefly title will follow and after it has been publicly announced that such an event will take place in the near future. In either event the procedure is the same.|$|E
25|$|This {{notation}} {{means that}} the corresponding Slater determinants have a clear higher weight in the configuration interaction expansion. The atomic orbital concept is therefore a key concept for visualizing the excitation process associated with a given transition. For example, one can say for a given transition that it corresponds to the excitation of an electron from an occupied orbital to a given unoccupied orbital. Nevertheless, one has {{to keep in mind}} that electrons are fermions ruled by the Pauli exclusion principle and cannot be distinguished from the other electrons in the atom. Moreover, it sometimes <b>happens</b> <b>that</b> the configuration interaction expansion converges very slowly and that one cannot speak about simple one-determinant wave function at all. This is the case when electron correlation is large.|$|E

25|$|On one stormy night, the landlord, Huang Shiren, {{and several}} of his other {{servants}} come to the temple to worship and provide offerings. Their trip is stopped by the thunderstorm. It just so <b>happens</b> <b>that</b> Xi'er is now in the temple too, and by the light of a flash of lightning, the landlord sees her—with her long white hair and shabby clothes that have been weathered to nearly white. He thinks it is the reincarnation of a goddess who has come to punish him for his mistreatment of Xi'er and other despotisms. He is so frightened that he is literally paralyzed. Xi'er recognizes that it is her arch-enemy and seizes the opportunity to take further revenge. She picks up the brass incense burner and hurls it against the landlord. The landlord and his gang flee.|$|E
25|$|Many {{mathematical}} objects, such as sets {{of numbers}} and functions, exhibit internal structure {{as a consequence of}} operations or relations that are defined on the set. Mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure; for instance number theory studies properties of the set of integers that can be expressed in terms of arithmetic operations. Moreover, it frequently <b>happens</b> <b>that</b> different such structured sets (or structures) exhibit similar properties, which makes it possible, by a further step of abstraction, to state axioms for a class of structures, and then study at once the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms. Thus one can study groups, rings, fields and other abstract systems; together such studies (for structures defined by algebraic operations) constitute the domain of abstract algebra.|$|E
25|$|More {{rarely a}} {{defect in the}} magnet can cause a quench. When this <b>happens,</b> <b>that</b> {{particular}} spot is subject to rapid Joule heating from the enormous current, which raises {{the temperature of the}} surrounding regions. This pushes those regions into the normal state as well, which leads to more heating in a chain reaction. The entire magnet rapidly becomes normal (this can take several seconds, {{depending on the size of}} the superconducting coil). This is accompanied by a loud bang as the energy in the magnetic field is converted to heat, and rapid boil-off of the cryogenic fluid. The abrupt decrease of current can result in kilovolt inductive voltage spikes and arcing. Permanent damage to the magnet is rare, but components can be damaged by localized heating, high voltages, or large mechanical forces.|$|E

25|$|Sheung Joi Sum – Sum is a {{peaceful}} 25-year-old girl {{and is a}} friend of Yan and On. She starts off the series as a poor, unconfident and struggling young woman trying to look after her father who suffers from Alzheimer's disease. On who had feelings for her was rejected by her because she loved another man, Ching Leung. It so <b>happens</b> <b>that</b> she manages to end up working with him in a lawyer firm. They would eventually develop a relationship, but because of their misunderstandings they would often argue and break up various times. Their final break up would be after Leung begins a third-party relationship with her best friend, Ha. Later on in the series she matures into a blooming young lady and becomes a confident emerging lawyer. On finally has a chance to confront her with a proposal after Leung's death.|$|E
25|$|All large {{businesses}} incur {{administrative costs}} {{in the process of}} delivering revenue collected from customers to the suppliers of the goods or services being purchased. Taxation is no different; the resource collected from the public through taxation is always greater than the amount which can be used by the government. The difference is called the compliance cost and includes (for example) the labour cost and other expenses incurred in complying with tax laws and rules. The collection of a tax in order to spend it on a specified purpose, for example collecting a tax on alcohol to pay directly for alcoholism-rehabilitation centres, is called hypothecation. Finance ministers often dislike this practice, since it reduces their freedom of action. Some economic theorists regard hypothecation as intellectually dishonest since, in reality, money is fungible. Furthermore, it often <b>happens</b> <b>that</b> taxes or excises initially levied to fund some specific government programs are then later diverted to the government general fund. In some cases, such taxes are collected in fundamentally inefficient ways, for example, though highway tolls.|$|E
25|$|According to this argument, {{the fact}} the Electoral College {{is made up of}} real people instead of mere numbers allows for human {{judgment}} and flexibility to make a decision, if it <b>happens</b> <b>that</b> a candidate dies or becomes legally disabled {{around the time of the}} election. Advocates of the current system argue that human electors would be in a better position to choose a suitable replacement than the general voting public. According to this view, electors could act decisively during the critical time interval between when ballot choices become fixed in state ballots until mid-December when the electors formally cast their ballots. In the election of 1872, losing Liberal Republican candidate Horace Greeley died during this time interval, which resulted in disarray for the Democratic Party, who also supported Greeley, but the Greeley electors were able to split their votes for different alternate candidates. A situation in which the winning candidate died has never happened. In the election of 1912, Vice President Sherman died shortly before the election when it was too late for states to remove his name from their ballots; accordingly, Sherman was listed posthumously, but the eight electoral votes that Sherman would have received were cast instead for Nicholas Murray Butler.|$|E
