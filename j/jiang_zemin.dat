5|$|When Hu Jintao succeeded <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin</b> as General Secretary in late 2002, Bo's {{career as}} a local {{official}} ended with his appointment to Minister of Commerce in Wen Jiabao's cabinet to replace Lü Fuyuan, who retired for health reasons. Bo also earned {{a seat on the}} 16th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.|$|E
5|$|On April 25, 1999, over 10,000 Falun Gong adherents {{demonstrated}} quietly {{near the}} Zhongnanhai government compound to request official recognition {{and an end}} to the escalating harassment against them. Security czar and politburo member Luo Gan was the first {{to draw attention to the}} gathering crowd. Luo reportedly called Communist Party general secretary <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin,</b> and demanded a decisive solution to the Falun Gong problem.|$|E
5|$|Lawyers {{acting on}} behalf of Falun Gong {{practitioners}} have filed dozens of largely symbolic lawsuits around the world against <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin,</b> Luo Gan, and other Chinese officials alleging genocide and crimes against humanity. According to International Advocates for Justice, Falun Gong has filed the largest number of human rights lawsuits in the 21st century and the charges are among the most severe international crimes defined by international criminal laws. As of 2006, 54 civil and criminal lawsuits were under way in 33 countries.|$|E
5|$|Although Falun Gong {{is practiced}} freely within Hong Kong, Falun Gong {{practitioners}} from abroad have also reported being blacklisted {{from entering the}} territory. In 2001, Hong Kong officials admitted that they had used a blacklist to deny entry to approximately 100 Falun Gong practitioners during a visit by then-Communist Party chief <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin.</b> In 2004, a Canadian Falun Gong practitioner on a book tour was denied entry to the territory, and in 2008, two Falun Gong practitioners from the United States and Switzerland were separately denied entry while on professional and research trips.|$|E
5|$|In June 2002, when <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin</b> visited Iceland, Icelandic {{authorities}} {{complied with}} requests from the Chinese government to deny entry to Falun Gong practitioners {{who sought to}} enter the country to protest. Using a blacklist provided by China, hundreds of Falun Gong practitioners were turned away by the national airline or detained if they managed {{to make it to}} the country. The blacklisting ignited protests by Icelandic citizens and members of parliament. In 2011, Iceland's foreign minister Össur Skarphéðinsson issued an apology for violating Falun Gong practitioners' freedom of expression and movement.|$|E
5|$|On 25 April 1999, {{more than}} ten {{thousand}} practitioners congregated outside Communist Party of China headquarters in Zhongnanhai to request legal recognition. That evening, then-Communist Party leader <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin</b> issued a decision to eradicate Falun Gong. At Jiang's direction, on 7 June 1999 a special leading group was established within the party's Central Committee to manage the persecution. The resulting organisation, called the 6-10 Office, {{assumed the role of}} coordinating the anti-Falun Gong media coverage in the state-run press, as well influencing other party and state entities such as the courts and security agencies. On 19 July, the Central Committee of the Communist Party issued a document effectively banning the practice of Falun Gong. The following day, hundreds of practitioners were detained by security forces.|$|E
5|$|For {{a case to}} be investigated, {{a person}} needs to {{petition}} the CCDI. Although the main petition office is the Complaints Office, petitions are usually sent to other offices and institutions (such as the Supreme People's Court, Supreme People's Procuratorate, the National People's Congress and party leadership {{as high as the}} PSC) as well. Petitions may also be filed on the CCDI website, and the commission receives cases through the Office for Circuit Inspection Work (which sends inspection teams throughout the country). In a case handled by former ODIS Third Division director and Case Hearing Office director Li Huiran, a petition was sent to all department heads in the ministry employing the petitioner, several offices of the CCDI and PSC members <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin,</b> Li Peng, Zhu Rongji and Wei Jianxing.|$|E
5|$|Early in September 1990, Vietnamese Prime Minister Đỗ Mười, General Secretary Nguyen Van Linh {{and former}} Prime Minister Pham Van Dong {{travelled}} to Chengdu, China, where {{they held a}} secret meeting with Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng and General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin.</b> On 17 September 1990, General Võ Nguyên Giáp also made a trip to China and thanked the Chinese Government for its past assistance. Despite outward signs of improvement in Vietnam's diplomatic relations with China, Vietnamese leaders were reluctant to endorse any peace plan which could weaken their client regime in Phnom Penh. However, as the four Cambodian factions reached an agreement on the power-sharing arrangement outlined at the Third Jakarta Informal Meeting in February 1990, Vietnam and China rapidly moved to re-establish formal diplomatic relations. In November 1991, newly elected Vietnamese Prime Minister Võ Văn Kiệt travelled to Beijing and met his Chinese counterpart, Li Peng, and they issued an 11-point communiqué re-establishing diplomatic ties {{between the two countries}} after 10 years without formal relations.|$|E
25|$|Much saber-rattling by the PRC {{has been}} done over this, with <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin,</b> after {{assuming}} the mantle of the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, becoming a leading voice.|$|E
25|$|Representing the People's Republic of China {{were the}} President, <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin,</b> the Premier, Li Peng, {{and the first}} Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa. The event was {{broadcast}} around the world.|$|E
25|$|Security czar and politburo member Luo Gan {{was less}} conciliatory, {{and called on}} <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin,</b> the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China to find a decisive {{solution}} to the Falun Gong problem.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the foreign}} {{leaders who have}} visited the Khatyn Memorial during their time in office are Richard Nixon of the US, Fidel Castro of Cuba, Rajiv Gandhi of India, Yasser Arafat of the PLO, and <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin</b> of China.|$|E
25|$|In July 2001, he was {{elevated}} {{to the post}} of Deputy Secretary and acting mayor of Yangzhou, and was confirmed as the city's mayor a year later. In 2004 he was named Party Secretary of Yangzhou. Yangzhou is the hometown of former Chinese president <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin.</b>|$|E
25|$|From 2002 to 2004, the {{paramount}} {{position of power}} in China were transferred from <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin</b> to Hu Jintao. Annual Falun Gong deaths in custody continued to grow through 2004, according to reports published by Falun Gong sources, but coverage of Falun Gong declined over the period.|$|E
25|$|During Tung's {{first term}} the {{government}} proposed {{a number of}} controversial infrastructure and reformation projects including technology park, a science park, a Chinese medicine centre and the Disney theme park. Tung's decisions were somewhat questioned by the central government, including <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin,</b> former General Secretary of the Communist Party of China.|$|E
25|$|The party's {{official}} stance {{towards the}} incident {{is that the}} use of force was necessary in order to control a 'political disturbance' and that it ensured the stability necessary for economic prosperity. Chinese leaders, including former paramount leaders <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin</b> and Hu Jintao, reiterate this line when questioned by foreign press.|$|E
25|$|Chinese premier Zhou Enlai visited Ethiopia in January 1964. The Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie visited Beijing in October 1971, {{where he}} was {{received}} by Mao Zedong. Qian Qichen, China's vice-premier and minister of foreign affairs, visited Ethiopia in July 1989, January 1991 and January 1994. Chinese president <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin</b> visited in May 1996.|$|E
25|$|According to {{numerous}} Chinese-language media outlets, Wang is {{the nephew of}} Wang Yeping, wife of former President and General Secretary <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin,</b> although some political insiders from Shenzhen have dismissed this as a baseless rumour. Nevertheless, he was widely {{considered to be a}} protege of Jiang, who is also from Jiangsu province.|$|E
25|$|Tensions {{continue}} to escalate over this period, {{culminating in a}} demonstration on 25 April 1999 near the Zhongnanhai government compound, where over ten thousand Falun Gong practitioners gather to request official recognition. Following the event, <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin,</b> then-General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, quietly prepares for the launch of a nationwide campaign to persecute the practice.|$|E
25|$|In November 1997 {{during a}} Harvard University speech, President <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin</b> praised Admiral Zheng He for {{spreading}} Chinese culture abroad. This may give an indication {{on how the}} present-day Chinese people perceive these historical events, namely that the voyages were conducted in accordance to Confucian ideals. In 2005, China commemorated the 600th anniversary of Zheng He's maiden voyage, characterizing it as {{the start of a}} series of peaceful seafaring explorations.|$|E
25|$|The {{newspaper}} counters what {{it considers}} to be Chinese Communist Party propaganda through its own opinion pieces and reporting. The newspaper covers causes and groups opposed to the CCP, including Falun Gong, dissidents, activists, and supporters of the Tibetan government-in-exile. The paper also reports on Falun Gong-related news, including the group's attempt to sue former Chinese leader <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin</b> under civil legislation for genocide, not covered by most other overseas Chinese-language newspapers.|$|E
25|$|Hu {{participated in}} the Communist Party {{for most of his}} career, notably as Party Committee Secretary for Guizhou {{province}} and the Tibet Autonomous Region, and then later First Secretary of the Central Secretariat and Vice-President under former leader <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin.</b> Hu is the first leader of the Communist Party without any significant revolutionary credentials. As such, his rise to the leadership represented China's transition of leadership from establishment communists to younger, more pragmatic technocrats.|$|E
25|$|Paulson {{has been}} {{described}} as an avid nature lover. He {{has been a member of}} The Nature Conservancy for decades and was the organization's board chairman and co-chair of its Asia-Pacific Council. In that capacity, Paulson worked with former President of the People's Republic of China <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin</b> to preserve the Tiger Leaping Gorge in Yunnan province. Paulson co-chairs a group called Risky Business that raises awareness of the projected economic impact of climate change.|$|E
25|$|Western {{observers}} attribute a {{sense of}} caution to Hu's philosophies, citing China's recent history of fallen heirs. Deng Xiaoping appointed three party General Secretaries, all designed to be successors, and {{was instrumental in the}} ousting of two of them, Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang. His third and final selection, <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin,</b> won Deng's continued, although ambiguous backing and was the only General Secretary in Communist Chinese history to voluntarily leave his post when his term ended.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1990s, however, Falun Gong became {{estranged from}} the state-run qigong {{associations}} in 1996, {{leading to a}} gradual escalation of tensions with Communist Party authorities that culminated in the Spring of 1999. Following a protest of 10,000 Falun Gong practitioners near the Zhongnanhai government compound on 25 April 1999 to request official recognition, then-Communist Party General Secretary <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin</b> ordered Falun Gong be crushed. A campaign of propaganda, large-scale extrajudicial imprisonment, torture and coercive reeducation ensued.|$|E
25|$|Falun Gong is a Chinese qigong {{discipline}} involving {{meditation and}} a moral philosophy rooted in Buddhist tradition. The practice rose to {{popularity in the}} 1990s in China, and by 1998, Chinese government sources estimated {{that as many as}} 70 million people had taken up the practice. Perceiving that Falun Gong was a potential threat to the Party’s authority and ideology, Communist Party leader <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin</b> initiated a nationwide campaign to eradicate the group in July 1999.|$|E
25|$|Falun Gong {{practitioners}} continued adopting more novel {{approaches to}} protesting, including {{the establishment of}} a vast network of underground ‘material sites’ that create and distribute literature, and tapping into television broadcasts to replace them with Falun Gong content. Practitioners outside China established a television station to broadcast into China, designed censorship-circumvention tools to break through Internet censorship and surveillance, and filed dozens of largely symbolic lawsuits against <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin</b> and other Chinese officials alleging genocide and crimes against humanity.|$|E
25|$|University {{students}} in Shanghai also {{took to the}} streets to commemorate the death of Hu Yaobang and protest against certain policies of the government. In many cases, these were supported by the universities' Party committees. <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin,</b> then-Municipal Party Secretary, addressed the student protesters in a bandage and 'expressed his understanding', as he was a former student agitator before 1949. At the same time, he moved swiftly to send in police forces to control the streets and to purge Communist Party leaders who had supported the students.|$|E
25|$|The Monument to the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet was {{unveiled}} in the Potala Square in May 2002 {{to celebrate the}} 51st anniversary of the Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet, and {{the work in the}} development of the autonomous region since then. The 37-metre-high concrete monument is shaped as an abstract Mount Everest and its name is engraved with the calligraphy of former president <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin,</b> while an inscription describes the socioeconomic development experienced in Tibet in the past fifty years.|$|E
25|$|On April 19, {{the editors}} of the World Economic Herald, a {{magazine}} close to reformists, decided to publish a commemorative section on Hu. Inside was an article by Yan Jiaqi, which commented favourably on the Beijing student protests, and called for a reassessment of Hu's 1987 purge. Sensing the conservative political trends in Beijing, <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin</b> demanded that the article be censored. Many newspapers were printed with a blank page. Jiang then suspended Qin Benli. His decisive action earned accolades from party elders, who praised Jiang's loyalty.|$|E
25|$|Many {{calls were}} made for the {{resignation}} of Tung Chee-hwa, a leader who was blessed by the Communist Party of China, <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin.</b> Tung remained in the office until 10 March 2005, 20 months after the march against Article 23. Hong Kong's Basic Law permitted Tung to serve another 3 years, many suspected Beijing forced him to resign due to widespread public disapproval and his perceived lacklustre leadership. The 2005 election filled the seat with Donald Tsang who was the No. 2 ranking official, Chief Secretary, and career civil servant during British colonial rule.|$|E
25|$|A renowned {{painter of}} the Lingnan School of Chinese art, He Xiangning was elected the third {{chairperson}} of the China Artists Association in July 1960. She particularly enjoyed painting plum blossoms, pine trees, tigers, and lions. A collection of her paintings was published in 1979 in Guangdong. On 18 April 1997, He Xiangning Art Museum was opened in Shenzhen. It was China's first national-level art museum named after an individual artist, and President <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin</b> wrote the calligraphy for the museum's name. In June 1998, China Post issued a set of three stamps (1998-15T) featuring her paintings.|$|E
25|$|After 1989 Bo intervened {{numerous}} times to support Deng's efforts to restart economic (but not political) liberalization, {{and to prevent}} economic hardliners from dominating Party politics. Even after completely retiring during the 1990s, his status meant that he remained an influential figure who still pulled strings behind the scenes and could make or unmake party officials. He used his influence to support the rise of <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin,</b> who became the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in the 1989. In 1993 he co-authored {{a book on the}} early history of the Chinese Communist Party.|$|E
25|$|During {{the speech}} former General {{secretary}} <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin</b> seemed very tired, was constantly yawning, {{and was not}} paying much attention. Jiang seldom talked to Wen Jiabao, who was sitting to his left. Wen was paying full attention to Hu's speech for its entire length. Hong Kong media noted that Jiang left the Great Hall without shaking anyone's hand, {{and that no one}} came up to shake his. Surprisingly, Mao's successor Hua Guofeng also attended the Congress as a delegate. All the surviving members of the 14th and 15th PSC's were present, including former Premiers Li Peng and Zhu Rongji, but with the exception of Jiang rival Qiao Shi.|$|E
25|$|On 12 August 1995, the Chinese head {{of state}} <b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin</b> {{travelled}} on board the ICE from Ludwigsburg (near Stuttgart) of Rolandseck (near Bonn). For this purpose, a special trainset had been coupled from two power cars and six intermediate cars, one {{of which had been}} converted to a palace car. The Guest of the State was accompanied by the Federal Minister of Transport Matthias Wissmann, DB chief of passenger operations Klaus Daubertshäuser and several board members of AEG and Siemens. The train reached a maximum speed of 280km/h. A visit to the cab that was scheduled for five minutes was extended to about 30 minutes by the Guest of the State. The companies involved hoped to sell ICE technology for the 1300km Beijing to Shanghai connection.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the opening}} of the 14th National Congress of the CPC in 1992, senior party leaders, {{including}} Deng and Chen Yun, were to select candidates for the Politburo Standing Committee to ensure a smooth transition of power from the so-called second-generation leaders (Deng, Chen, Li Xiannian, Wang Zhen, etc.) to third-generation leaders (<b>Jiang</b> <b>Zemin,</b> Li Peng, Qiao Shi etc.). Deng also proposed considering another candidate for a further future transition, preferably someone under fifty to represent the next generation of leaders. Song Ping, as the organization chief, recommended Hu as an ideal candidate for the prospect of a future leader. As a result, shortly before his 50th birthday, Hu Jintao became the youngest member of the seven-member Politburo Standing Committee, and one of the youngest PSC members since the Communist Party assumed power in 1949.|$|E
