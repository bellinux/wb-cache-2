500|$|... "Hello Kitty" [...] is a J-pop, dubstep, and EDM {{track that}} is three minutes and {{eighteen}} seconds long. [...] "Hello Kitty" [...] {{was written by}} Lavigne, Chad Kroeger, David Hodges and Martin Johnson, while the song was produced by Kroeger and Hodges. Brandon Paddock and Kyle Moorman became assistants in its production. The song was engineered by John Hanes, musical mixed by Serban Ghenea and additional programming was held by Paddock and Moorman. Lavigne described the lyrics while talking to Digital Spy, [...] "'Hello Kitty' was such an interesting topic and subject [...] It was really exciting for me. I didn't want it to sound like anything I'd done before. I wanted it to sound over the top so I ended up hiring a new producer to <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cheryl {{has named}} Britney Spears and Beyoncé {{as a few}} of her inspirations, {{performance}} and fashion-wise. She spoke on the reason Beyoncé was an influence on her, saying, [...] "I love Beyoncé, I just think she is such a beautiful person inside and out, apart from what she does on the stage which is obviously incredible and aspiration. I just like her as a woman. She's empowering." [...] She has cited Lisa [...] "Left Eye"' Lopes, a former member of American band TLC, as another influence saying, [...] "I wanted to be [...] – I used to wear baggy jeans and Timberlands like a tomboy." [...] Other influences she has cited are Rihanna, whom she described as [...] "a perfect pop star", and Mary J. Blige, saying, [...] "Mary's voice sounds so grown up and you can hear that she has experienced a lot in her life, her songs <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> every heartache." [...] Cheryl has influenced other artists, including Selena Gomez.|$|E
2500|$|Baker {{described}} {{working with}} Michael E. Knight (Tad Martin) and Eakes as a fun but somewhat intimidating experience. [...] "They are naturals at it!" [...] she stated. She said that Eakes helped her {{feel more comfortable}} during her first few weeks as Babe, {{and to get a}} better understanding of the character. [...] "She came up to me the first day we worked together and offered to go over lines together and <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> anything I needed. She is a sweetheart," [...] said Baker. Baker revealed that in her spare time in between takes as the character, she managed to find something to keep entertained by. [...] "It seems like there is always something to do when you have down time on the set," [...] she said. [...] "I either run lines with the other actors or hang out in the hair and makeup room. I love those ladies!" [...] Adding to Baker's enjoyment on the set was Young. [...] "He is always cracking jokes!" [...] stated Baker.|$|E

2500|$|On December 16, 2013, Newsted {{expanded}} upon previous statements {{regarding his}} departure from Metallica and cited that his project with Echobrain was being discouraged by James Hetfield because Metallica's management at Q Prime {{wanted to go}} ahead with promoting Echobrain but was forced to drop it by Hetfield's demands with the quote [...] "other arrangements can be made". Jason was sure that Echobrain would not affect Metallica as it was the pedigree that it already needed. Newsted continues, “And so they had told me, pretty convincingly, ‘This is a great record, we’ve been playing it around the office, that’s all I’ve been hearing, it’s fantastic, this kid has a great voice. Let’s do something with this.’ That’s what they told me, and then James Hetfield heard about it and was not happy. He was, I think, pretty much out to put the kibosh on the whole thing because it would somehow affect Metallica in his eyes, because now the managers were interested in something I was doing {{that had nothing to do}} with him. ”The bassist sums up the situation as follows: “I have no idea what [...] was thinking, other than just protecting what he valued, just like he does; that's his thing. He protects what he loves, squeezes it too hard, like he said himself. Squeeze it too hard, protecting it too much. That's where I was coming from. The people that I had counted on for 15 years to <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> my career, help Metallica, take care of my money, do all of those things, told me, 'Your new project is fantastic, we'd like to help you with it.' James heard about it, the manager calls me back a couple of days later – 'Sorry we're not going to be able to help you with that Echobrain thing.'” ...|$|E
