500|$|... "The Winds of Winter" [...] saw the {{departure}} of several cast members and recurring guest actors from the series. Notables included Dean-Charles Chapman, whose character, King Tommen Baratheon, committed suicide in the episode. Before appearing {{in the role of}} Tommen, which was originally portrayed by actor Callum Wharry, Chapman appeared in the third season of the series as Martyn Lannister, a minor character who was also killed off. Chapman stated that he found out about his character's death the night before the initial table read for the season, saying [...] "I was in my hotel, minding my own business, and I got a phone call. <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> and instantly, I knew it was coming. It was David Benioff and Dan Weiss, the two creators of the show, and they stated the facts. But they did it really nice. I couldn't have asked for a better way to have that news broken to me. Them telling me beforehand really helped me out, otherwise I would have been in a state when I read it in the scripts. I probably would have cried." ...|$|E
5000|$|For his part, Garfunkel had a {{different}} memory of the song's success: [...] We were in L.A. Our manager called us at the hotel we were staying at. We were both {{in the same room}}. We must have bunked in the same room in those days. <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> He said, 'Well, congratulations. Next week you will go from five to one in Billboard.' It was fun. I remember pulling open the curtains and letting the brilliant sun come into this very red room, and then ordering room service. That was good." ...|$|E
5000|$|Iron Butterfly {{was booked}} to appear, and is {{listed on the}} Woodstock poster for a Sunday performance, but could not perform because they were stuck at LaGuardia Airport. According to Production Coordinator John Morris, [...] "They sent me a {{telegram}} saying, 'We will arrive at LaGuardia. You will have helicopters pick us up. We will fly straight to the show. We will perform immediately, {{and then we will}} be flown out.' And <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and called Western Union... And telegram said: 'For reasons I can't go into / Until you are here / Clarifying your situation / Knowing you are having problems / You will have to find / Other transportation / Unless you plan not to come.'" [...] The first letter of each line in the telegram spelled out an acrostic making clear that Iron Butterfly was not welcome.|$|E

5000|$|Regarding {{the genesis}} of the project, Jimmy Webb wrote: I was sitting in my kitchen looking out into the {{backyard}} at the 100-year-old oaks that twer over our home, thinking back 50 years of the farm where the Cottonwoods grew and the tribe of young Webbs and Killingsworths who grew up like a tribe from Lord of the Flies, flinging flaming spears and digging caves in the banks of the creek. I thought about my own sons, {{and the fact that we}} are all rapidly growing older, including my father who is 86. As clear as day a voice spoke out of the heavens: 'You need to make an album with your boys.' <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> without hesitation and made the call to my son Justin. It was—without question—the best decision I ever let happen.|$|E
5000|$|This {{experiment}} was a landmark {{in the quest}} for energy, and it was typical of Fermi's approach. Every step was carefully planned, every calculation meticulously done. When the first self-sustained nuclear chain reaction was achieved, Compton made a coded phone call to James B. Conant, the chairman of the National Defense Research Committee. <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and called Conant. He was reached at the President's office at Harvard University."Jim," [...] I said, [...] "you'll be interested to know that the Italian navigator has just landed in the new world." [...] Then, half apologetically, because I had led the S-l Committee to believe that it would be another week or more before the pile could be completed, I added, [...] "the earth was not as large as he had estimated, and he arrived at the new world sooner than he had expected.""Is that so," [...] was Conant's excited response. [...] "Were the natives friendly?""Everyone landed safe and happy." ...|$|E

50|$|I {{came out}} and {{got a job in}} the WNEW radio station in New York, as what we called a {{continuity}} writer, which paid enough, I suppose, to eat. And at that time television was beginning, and I figured why not try it and see what I could do. I had a little story in my head and I wrote it. You know the phrase “throw it over the transom?” That’s what I did - to the slush pile over at NBC. “A Little Night Music,” it was called, and I think it was a Cameo Theatre. And, my God, the telephone rang one day when I was working at WNEW, and <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and listened very carefully, and she said, “We want to do your script.” I was stunned. I hung up, and everybody else in the office looked at me with vengeance. That’s where it began, professionally, where I was able to make some money out of the craft. After that happened, I began to figure out that if I did one television script a month, and they paid me at least $500 for that month, I could quit this job and live that way, doing one script a month for things like Cameo Theatre and other things that were around.|$|E
40|$|To the {{participants}} of this study, thank you! Thank you for giving of yourselves and your time. Thank {{you for your}} honesty and insights. Your caring and generosity made this dissertation possible. I am grateful to my co-advisors, Dr. Frances Lawrenz and Dr. Joan Garfield. Thank you for teaching me, supporting me, and believing in me through the years and through the completion of this dissertation. Frances, I cannot imagine what my time in graduate school {{would have been like}} without you, and I thank you for all you have done for me. Joan taught the first evaluation course I ever took, and the rest is history! Thank you to the remaining two members of my dissertation committee, Dr. Robert delMas and Dr. Norman Chervany. I remember meeting Bob for the first time, when I asked him a question about my MA paper. Thank you giving me sound advice then, and for your service on my committee. Norm, I’m infinitely happy that <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and called you out of the blue. That phone call led to you serving on my committee, and I cannot thank you enough. To the women at the Minnesota Center for Survey Research, Rossana Armson...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> glass, {{and held}} it before Ustane's eyes. She gazed, then felt at her hair, then gazed again, and then sank upon {{the ground with a}} sort of sob.|$|R

6000|$|Then suddenly: “Well, here he is—all of him I could see. Fair. Slight—slight enough. Look at that foot there. <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> legs first, {{one after}} another. He was that {{scattered}} you didn’t {{know where to}} begin.” ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> hatchets {{and swung}} {{them by their}} heads from the sling of my arm; turned Montgomery over; <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> his {{revolver}} still loaded in two chambers, and bending down to rummage, found half-a-dozen cartridges in his pocket.|$|R
5000|$|Other Manchester bands such as The Smiths and Oasis {{inspired}} Fray {{to write}} and form the band. [...] "Noel's <b>the</b> reason why <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> guitar when <b>I</b> was 11-years-old - trying to learn 'Wonderwall'," [...] admitted Fray.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Petie in triumph, and {{returned}} to the camp. There we skinned him and toasted his flesh over the fire. He just made a good meal for us, though we kept the hind legs for breakfast.|$|R
5000|$|Finally, {{the last}} three words of the book are {{adjusted}} in perhaps {{a nod to the}} fairy tale themes of the others: [...] "Smiling, <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> other two bundles and started after Shiara" [...] becomes [...] "...followed happily after".|$|R

60|$|Unobserved, <b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> wad. Right or wrong, I {{was bound}} {{to see what it}} contained.

Strange things had happened lately, and I was prepared for all sorts of surprises.|$|R
500|$|In early 2009, Leto told Billboard that he {{was excited}} by the song {{as soon as he}} wrote it.

50|$|<b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> first print. It was {{an outdoor}} scene. A lot like Walsmear's photos. There {{was a young}} girl, not nearly so pretty or angelic as the girls in Walsmear's photos. (Actually, I thought she looked a little cheap.) She was holding out her index finger. And {{standing}} on the index finger was - I couldn't believe my eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{tricks of}} the trade. I could take a funny idea and make a two-line joke of it, earning a dollar. With false {{whiskers}} on, it would serve up cold as a quatrain, doubling its producing value. By turning the skirt and adding a ruffle of rhyme you would hardly recognize it as vers de societe with neatly shod feet and a fashion-plate illustration.|$|R
