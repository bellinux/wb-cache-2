MOOCS have attracted student registration in hundreds of thousands per course in certain instances, as well as gaining acceptance across different societies. MOOCs present opportunities for learning in general and specifically learning towards <b>green</b> economy <b>transition</b> in Africa. Many MOOCs are currently hosted by {{institutions of higher education}} in the USA, with the first MOOC breakthrough entitled “Artificial Intelligence” having ‘exploded’ at Stanford University in California (USA) in summer 2011. The “Artificial Intelligence” enrolled 160, 000 students, 23, 000 of which graduated after 10 weeks. The question then is: are MOOCs feasible in educating African masses in the field of <b>green</b> economy <b>transition?</b> Born in 2008 and popularised throughout the years following the global financial crisis, world leaders confirmed from Rio+ 20 that <b>green</b> economy <b>transition</b> {{is the way to go}} if humanity is to remain sustainable on planet earth. This paper presents MOOCs as an emerging area with opportunities to enhance learning for <b>green</b> economy <b>transition</b> in general and specifically for Africa. The twin phenomena under discussion require massive roll outs of: firstly, learning management systems like MOOCs, and, secondly, the dissemination of massive appropriate content, knowledge and skills related to <b>green</b> economy <b>transition</b> that current formal education systems will not manage given the demand and urgency. The answer to the question raised is therefore a qualified ‘yes’ mainly due to limited e-readiness in the continent. Institute for Corporate Citizenshi...|$|R

40|$|The {{climate is}} changing, but the world’s states have not (yet) managed {{to reach an}} {{effective}} agreement on reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. What is needed is a <b>green</b> <b>transition</b> from the ‘logic of consequences’, the standard model of rational economic actors, to the ‘logic of appropriateness’. In this thesis, I identify {{the conditions under which}} an international transition towards the logic of appropriateness might occur in the field of climate change. To address this question, I develop an agent-based model that enables the dynamics of a <b>green</b> <b>transition</b> to be simulated computationally. My findings suggest that the possibility of distinguishing emitters from non-emitters increases the probability of a <b>green</b> <b>transition,</b> and that explicit pressure on those that do not punish others’ climate-harming behaviour is even more important. The simulation results also offer some insights concerning which individuals and states should be encouraged to compare themselves when assessing the appropriateness of their climate-harming behaviour. Finally, I consider the presence and absence of these mechanisms in the 2015 Paris Agreement, and offer some recommendations on how the most important mechanisms not embedded in the agreement could be implemented...|$|E

40|$|This project investigates {{whether the}} WTO, {{and the free}} trade {{obligations}} it upholds, creates sufficient policy space for states to undertake a transition to renewable energy. Initially, we examine Ontario’s <b>green</b> <b>transition</b> in 2009 through the Green Energy Act. This way, we {{gain an understanding of}} whether the Local Content Requirements, a trade discriminatory tool according to the WTO, was necessary in order to secure that the <b>green</b> <b>transition</b> would take place. LCRs and other discriminatory policy tools applied in China are then investigated, to achieve a better picture of the positive and negative consequences. Based on this understanding, we analyse whether the WTO's treatment of such conflicts are ideal for states to transition to RE. This leads us to analyse whether the interaction between the free trade rules of WTO, and the RE policies of states can be improved. We find that WTO rules to some extent are helpful for the <b>green</b> <b>transition</b> by encouraging competition, which can improve quality, lower prices and ensure innovation. However, it is necessary that this organisation is very clear about their rules, for states to conduct RE policies that comply with those. Under some circumstances, it is important that WTO rules create more policy space for protectionist measures, if this is crucial for the <b>green</b> <b>transition</b> of the energy sector. A few years of protection may contribute with certain potential benefits for the climate. Protectionist measures may be necessary for the limitation of greenhouse gas emissions in the country itself. It can also increase the supply of RE technology by allowing the creation of new globally competing players and thus achieve those exact benefits, which the free market is said to ensure...|$|E

The greening of transport, ie. {{the reduction of}} green-house gas emissions linked to transport, {{is a very important}} challenge. This can be done by reducing transport demand, by utilizing the transport system more efficiently and by using new technologies. The most important means are battery-driven, biofuel-driven and hydrogen-driven cars, buses, trucks and ships. Better city and transport planning is also important. The Nordic countries have a lot of strengths in private enterprises, in research and in the way public authorities have invested in the <b>green</b> <b>transition</b> of our transport systems.

40|$|The global {{movement}} promoting <b>green</b> growth <b>transition</b> {{is growing}} into one huge multi-dimensional game changer and evidence {{pointing to the}} death of the internal combustion engine (ICE) is growing. Green growth rests upon the need to convert economies from being resource-intensive to being low carbon and resource-efficient aimed at addressing, among key challenges, ecosystems decay, biodiversity loss, climate change, water stress, and energy security. To this end, the use of renewable energy as well as clean and energy efficient technologies is now inevitable. Among such clean and energy efficient technologies today are electric vehicles, especially battery electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. Could <b>green</b> growth <b>transition</b> be a game changer offering multiple tipping points against the ICE? This is a question the paper addresses. The paper presents arguments that contribute to current global debates regarding the role of renewable energy as well as clean and energy efficient technology in green growth, especially in the transport sector. The paper conclusion is that, yes, if there is global scaling up, green growth signals the inevitable death of the ICE in the not so distant future...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the case}} of {{technology}} transitions to low-carbon sources of energy, there is growing evidence that even in countries with a strong political consensus {{in favor of a}} transition, the pace has been slow in comparison with the need to reduce greenhouse gases. One factor that affects the slowness of the transition is political resistance from the incumbent industrial regime. Using data on the mobilization of resistance from the fossil-fuel industry in the United States, the study builds on the growing literature on the political dimensions of sustainability transitions by drawing attention to the role of incumbent regime coalitions, grassroots coalitions in support of <b>green</b> <b>transition</b> policies, and countervailing industrial power. Case studies of political coalitions for ballot propositions in the U.
