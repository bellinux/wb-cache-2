5|$|Early medieval gardens <b>in</b> <b>Islamic</b> Spain resembled botanic {{gardens of}} the future, an example being the 11th-century Huerta del Ray garden of {{physician}} and author Ibn Wafid (999–1075 CE) in Toledo. This was later {{taken over by}} garden chronicler Ibn Bassal (fl. 1085 CE) until the Christian conquest in 1085 CE. Ibn Bassal then founded a garden in Seville, most of its plants being collected on a botanical expedition that included Morocco, Persia, Sicily, and Egypt. The medical school of Montpelier was also founded by Spanish Arab physicians, and by 1250 CE, it included a physic garden, but the site was not given botanic garden status until 1593.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{following}} their repeated failures before Constantinople, {{and the continued}} resilience of the Byzantine state, the Muslims began to project the fall of Constantinople to the distant future. Thus the city's fall came {{to be regarded as}} one of the signs of the arrival of the end times <b>in</b> <b>Islamic</b> eschatology. The siege became a motif in Byzantine apocalyptic literature as well, with decisive final battles against the Arabs before the walls of Constantinople being featured in the early 8th-century Greek translation of the Syriac Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius and the Apocalypse of Daniel, written either at about the time of the siege or a century later.|$|E

5|$|Metal {{artefacts}} {{share the}} same geometric designs {{that are used in}} other forms of Islamic art. However, in the view of Hamilton Gibb, the emphasis differs: geometric patterns tend to be used for borders, and if they are in the main decorative area they are most often used in combination with other motifs such as floral designs, arabesques, animal motifs, or calligraphic script. Geometric designs <b>in</b> <b>Islamic</b> metalwork can form a grid decorated with these other motifs, or they can form the background pattern.|$|E
5|$|Narcissi {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular garden plants <b>in</b> <b>Islamic</b> culture. Prior to the Arab conquest of Persia, the Persian ruler Khosrau I is said to have not been able to {{tolerate}} them at feasts because they reminded him of eyes, an association that persists to this day, as described by the poet Ghalib. The eye imagery is also found in a number of poems by Abu Nuwas. Another poet who refers to narcissi, is Rumi. Even the prophet Mohammed is said to have praised the narcissus.|$|E
5|$|Prince Sadruddin's {{interest}} <b>in</b> <b>Islamic</b> art was sparked in {{his youth}} by his paternal grandmother's library of Persian books, mystical texts and astrological treatises.

He would bid regularly at Sotheby's and Christie's auctions in Europe and North America. For advice, he looked to his friend Stuart Cary Welch, a noted historian of Islamic art at Harvard University.|$|E

5|$|The Oran fatwa was a responsum fatwa, or an Islamic legal opinion, {{issued in}} 1504 {{to address the}} crisis that {{occurred}} when Muslims in the Crown of Castile (now part of Spain) were forced to convert to Christianity in 15001502. The fatwa sets out detailed relaxations of the sharia (Islamic law) requirements, allowing the Muslims to conform outwardly to Christianity and perform acts that are ordinarily forbidden <b>in</b> <b>Islamic</b> law, when necessary to survive. It includes relaxed instructions for fulfilling the ritual prayers, the ritual charity, and the ritual ablution, and recommendations when obliged to violate Islamic law, such as worshipping as Christians, committing blasphemy, and consuming pork and wine.|$|E
5|$|The {{altering}} of the qibla {{was precisely}} the reason the Rashidun caliph Umar, despite identifying the mosque which Muhammad used to ascend to Heaven upon his arrival at the Noble Sanctuary in 638, neither prayed facing it nor built any structure upon it. This was because {{the significance of that}} particular spot on the Noble Sanctuary was superseded <b>in</b> <b>Islamic</b> jurisprudence by the Kaaba in Mecca after the change of the qibla towards that site.|$|E
5|$|The {{geometric}} designs <b>in</b> <b>Islamic</b> art {{are often}} built on combinations of repeated squares and circles, {{which may be}} overlapped and interlaced, as can arabesques (with which they are often combined), to form intricate and complex patterns, including {{a wide variety of}} tessellations. These may constitute the entire decoration, may form a framework for floral or calligraphic embellishments, or may retreat into the background around other motifs. The complexity and variety of patterns used evolved from simple stars and lozenges in the ninth century, through a variety of 6- to 13-point patterns by the 13thcentury, and finally to include also 14- and 16-point stars in the sixteenth century.|$|E

5|$|A real {{physical}} tessellation is a tiling made {{of materials}} such as cemented ceramic squares or hexagons. Such tilings may be decorative patterns, or may have functions such as providing durable and water-resistant pavement, floor or wall coverings. Historically, tessellations were used in Ancient Rome and <b>in</b> <b>Islamic</b> art {{such as in the}} decorative geometric tiling of the Alhambra palace. In the twentieth century, the work of M. C. Escher often made use of tessellations, both in ordinary Euclidean geometry and in hyperbolic geometry, for artistic effect. Tessellations are sometimes employed for decorative effect in quilting. Tessellations form a class of patterns in nature, for example in the arrays of hexagonal cells found in honeycombs.|$|E
5|$|According to Ibn Kathir, Uzair lived {{between the}} times of King Solomon {{and the time of}} Zachariah, father of John the Baptist. Some Quranic {{commentators}} viewed Uzayr as a learned scholar who sought to teach the people the forgotten laws of God. He is sometimes identified as the protagonist in the Quranic story of the man who slept for a hundred years (2:259). Some Islamic scholars held Uzayr {{to be one of the}} prophets. However, Islamic tradition also reports that God expunged Uzayr from the list of prophets because he refused to believe in qadar (predestination). Ibn Hazm, al-Samaw'al and other scholars put forth the view that Uzair (or one of his disciples) falsified the Torah, and this claim became a common theme <b>in</b> <b>Islamic</b> polemics against the Bible. Many aspects of later Islamic narratives show similarity to Vision of Ezra, an apocryphal text which seems to have been partially known to Muslim readers.|$|E
