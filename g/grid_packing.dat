40|$|Edge Localized Modes (ELMs) are {{repetitive}} eruptions {{of particles}} and energy which occur in many high confinement mode plasmas. In present devices the power loads {{delivered to the}} divertor during an ELM do not pose a serious problem. However, extrapolations to the ITER tokamak suggest that divertor lifetimes maybe reduced below acceptable levels. The application of Resonant Magnetic Perturbations (RMPs) to the plasma has successfully demonstrated ELM mitigation and suppression, under a number of operating scenarios. However, the physical mechanism by which mitigation and suppression is achieved is still not well understood. Furthermore many questions remain concerning the threshold perturbation strength and perturbation spectrum required. Models and theory initially developed for error field analysis are increasingly being used, and developed, to explain the plasma response to RMPs. The BOUT++ code is tested against a selection of linear layer problems. This {{is the first step}} in applying the code to model the self consistent plasma response to RMPs. The code is demonstrated to be consistent with theory in all cases modeled. In addition for the first time the importance of radial <b>grid</b> <b>packing</b> is considered in obtaining accurate simulations to RMP experiments. A novel multi-surface model is developed, and a single and two surface model is applied to the neighborhood of the radial location at which the perpendicular electron rotation is zero. Bifurcation windows are produced which are in qualitative agreement with ELM suppression q 95 windows.

Point positions and normals in these runs are incrementally encoded.

40|$|The {{essence of}} this paper is to report the {{computational}} research conducted to further NASA 2 ̆ 7 s study of active flow control systems for a flush­-mounted inlet with significant boundary-­layer ingestion (BLI). In conjunction with a NASA-­sponsored research grant, the aim is to further accumulate knowledge and insight on the effectiveness of flow control devices in reducing circumferential distortion. Using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), this study seeks to validate wind tunnel results recorded by the NASA Langley Research Center. After numerically reproducing experimental data, the future goal is use CFD to simulate the interaction between the inlet and turbofan stage. This study focused on NASA 2 ̆ 7 s air jet flow control devices, specifically a 16 -­jet version referred to as “configuration­- 10 ”. The accuracy and validity of the numerical solutions was dependent on their ability to match the following experimental values: mass flow rate through the S-­duct, mass flow ratio, pressure measurements along the center line, and distortion coefficient at the aerodynamic interface plane. Three computational grids, containing 6. 5, 30. 5, and 36. 9 million nodes, were constructed for the numerical simulations. The three grids varied in solid modeling techniques and <b>grid</b> element <b>packing.</b> Time limitations prevented the inclusion of results for the largest computational grid. Yet for the two smaller computational grids, the “Tenasi” flow solver was able to calculate valid numerical solutions for the “baseline” case (no jet flow) as well as low jet mass flow rate cases. High jet mass flow rate cases noticeably strayed from the experimental distortion measurements. Even though the numerical solutions did not replicate the experimental values for all mass flow ratio cases, this research significantly contributed to the knowledge and understanding of vorticity, flow characteristics, and distortion reduction for the BLI flush­mounted inlet. The CFD results provide visual representations of the changing flow characteristics as the jet mass flow rate is increased, in addition to flow interaction with intrusive experimental measuring devices. It is felt that better agreement with high­mass flow rate experimental cases can be calculated by numerically refining the jet boundary conditions and jet flow parameters.

Results: The improved affinity functions show superior performance compared to their traditional counterparts in finding correct docking poses at higher ranks.

40|$|The ice accrued on {{airfoils}} {{can have}} enormously complicated shapes with multiple protruded horns and feathers. In this paper, several blocking topologies are proposed and evaluated {{on their ability}} to produce high-quality structured multi-block grid systems. A transition layer grid is introduced to ensure that jaggedness on the ice-surface geometry do not to propagate into the domain. This is important for grid-generation methods based on hyperbolic PDEs (Partial Differential Equations) and algebraic transfinite interpolation. A 'thick' wrap-around grid is introduced to ensure that grid lines clustered next to solid walls do not propagate as streaks of tightly <b>packed</b> <b>grid</b> lines into the interior of the domain along block boundaries. For ice shapes that are not too complicated, a method is presented for generating high-quality single-block grids. To demonstrate the usefulness of the methods developed, grids and CFD solutions were generated for two iced airfoils: the NLF 0414 airfoil with and without the 623 -ice shape and the B 575 / 767 airfoil with and without the 145 m-ice shape. To validate the computations, the computed lift coefficients as a function of angle of attack were compared with available experimental data. The ice shapes and the blocking topologies were prepared by NASA Glenn's SmaggIce software. The grid systems were generated by using a four-boundary method based on Hermite interpolation with controls on clustering, orthogonality next to walls, and C continuity across block boundaries. The flow was modeled by the ensemble-averaged compressible Navier-Stokes equations, closed by the shear-stress transport turbulence model in which the integration is to the wall. All solutions were generated by using the NPARC WIND code...|$|R
40|$|Computational {{simulation}} of protein-protein docking can expedite {{the process of}} molecular modeling and drug discovery. This paper reports on our new F(2) Dock protocol which improves {{the state of the}} art in initial stage rigid body exhaustive docking search, scoring and ranking by introducing improvements in the shape-complementarity and electrostatics affinity functions, a new knowledge-based interface propensity term with FFT formulation, a set of novel knowledge-based filters and finally a solvation energy (GBSA) based reranking technique. Our algorithms are based on highly efficient data structures including the dynamic <b>packing</b> <b>grids</b> and octrees which significantly speed up the computations and also provide guaranteed bounds on approximation error. The improved affinity functions show superior performance compared to their traditional counterparts in finding correct docking poses at higher ranks. We found that the new filters and the GBSA based reranking individually and in combination significantly improve the accuracy of docking predictions with only minor increase in computation time. We compared F(2) Dock 2. 0 with ZDock 3. 0. 2 and found improvements over it, specifically among 176 complexes in ZLab Benchmark 4. 0, F(2) Dock 2. 0 finds a near-native solution as the top prediction for 22 complexes; where ZDock 3. 0. 2 does so for 13 complexes. F(2) Dock 2. 0 finds a near-native solution within the top 1000 predictions for 106 complexes as opposed to 104 complexes for ZDock 3. 0. 2. However, there are 17 and 15 complexes where F(2) Dock 2. 0 finds a solution but ZDock 3. 0. 2 does not and vice versa; which indicates that the two docking protocols can also complement each other. The docking protocol has been implemented as a server with a graphical client (TexMol) which allows the user to manage multiple docking jobs, and visualize the docked poses and interfaces. Both the server and client are available for download. Server: [URL] Client: [URL]...|$|R
