50|$|A {{number of}} these banners survive. In some {{instances}} it is unclear if the surviving banner is an original or a copy, or even a later forgery.Well-preserved are the originals of Zurich (<b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the Swiss National Museum, Lucerne, Schwyz (<b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the Museum of the Swiss Charters of Confederation), Uri (<b>kept</b> <b>in</b> Rathaus Altdorf) and Obwalden.The Fribourg banner is damaged, about half of its cloth and the Zwickelbild survive, of the Bernese banner only the Zwickelbild.Also considered originals by Durrer (1907/8:352) are the damaged specimens of Biel, Saanen, St. Gallen (city), St. Gallen (abbey), Diessenhofen, Frauenfeld, Rothenburg.

5000|$|This fish {{is popular}} in reef aquariums and is {{resistant}} to diseases. These fish are relatively docile {{and will not}} attack tankmates where <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> a suitably sized aquarium; however, if <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> confined quarters these fish may squabble over territory. Firefish are commonly <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> nano reef aquariums.|$|R

50|$|This grouper is {{commonly}} <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> marine aquaria. Great {{care must be}} taken when purchasing this fish, as it can reach 50 cm (20 in), and is fast-growing.

40|$|The optimum {{salinity}} {{requirement of}} Macrobrachium rosenbergii brooders for better hatching andsurvival of hatchlings is studied. The berried females of M. rosenbergii were <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> different salinities (0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 ppt) during incubation period. Maximum hatching rate (98 % and 97 %) was recorded when theberried females were <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> 0 ppt and 5 ppt salinities respectively. The post larvae appeared at very shortperiods of 22 and 24 days where brooders <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> 0 and 5 ppt salinities. The larval cycle completed within 35 and 37 {{days when the}} brooders acclimatized in 0 and 5 ppt respectively. Survival percentages of 82 and 79 werealso high from the brooders <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> 0 and 5 ppt. Inferior hatching rate, extended larval batch and lower survivalrate is observed from brooders <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> 10, 15 and 20 ppt salinities. The hatchery technology proposed is quitesimple and {{can be applied to}} small-scale operations...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test whether {{environmental}} enrichment alters the status and responsiveness of pituitary-adrenocortical and sympathetic-adrenomedullary hormones in rats. Previous studies have shown that rats <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> an enriched environment differ from those <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> standard cages in dendritic branching, synaptogenesis, memory function, emotionality and behaviour. In male Wistar rats <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> an enriched environment for 40 days, we studied basal concentrations of hormones, endocrine responses to 5 -HT 1 A challenge and responsiveness and adaptation to repeated handling. Environmental enrichment consisted of large plexiglass cages with 10 rats per cage, which contained variety of objects exchanged three times a week. Rats <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> this enriched environment had higher resting plasma concentrations of corticosterone, larger adrenals and increased corticosterone release to buspirone challenge compared to controls. Lower adrenocorticotropic hormone, corticosterone and adrenaline responses to handling were noticed <b>in</b> rats <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> an enriched environment. Exposure to repeated handling led to a more rapid extinction of corticosterone responses <b>in</b> rats <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> an enriched environment. Thus, environmental enrichment leads to pronounced changes in neuroendocrine regulation, including larger adrenals and increased adrenocortical function, which are so far considered to be indication of chronic stress...|$|R

5|$|Newly hatched Aylesbury ducklings are timid {{and thrive}} best in small groups, so the duckers would divide them into {{groups of three}} or four ducklings, each {{accompanied}} by a hen. As the ducklings grew older and gained confidence, they would be <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> groups of around 30. Originally the ducks would be <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> every room in the ducker's cottage, but {{towards the end of the}} 19thcentury they were <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> outdoor pens and sheds with suitable protection against cold weather.|$|R
50|$|Pristella maxillaris is a small, {{adaptable}} {{fish that}} is often <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> a home aquarium and will eat most fish foods. It is tolerant {{of a range of}} water chemistry values (pH 6-8; hardness up to 20 dGH). As a shoaling species, it is usually <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> groups of at least six specimens and away from aggressive or predatory tankmates, but is otherwise easily <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the community tank. The minimum aquarium size is typically 60 x 30cm (15 Gallons).|$|R
50|$|The {{effect of}} choice of what pages to be <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> main memory (as {{distinct}} from being paged out to auxiliary storage) is important: if too many {{pages of a}} process are <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> main memory, then fewer other processes can be ready at any one time. If too few pages of a process are <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> main memory, then the page fault frequency is greatly increased {{and the number of}} active (non-suspended) processes currently executing in the system approaches zero.|$|R
