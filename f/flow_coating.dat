40|$|International audienceWe {{investigate}} <b>flow</b> <b>coating</b> processes, i. e., {{the formation}} of dry coatings starting from dilute complex fluids confined between a static blade and a moving substrate. In particular, {{we focus on the}} evaporative regime encountered at low substrate velocity, at which the coating flow is driven mainly by solvent evaporation in the liquid meniscus. In this regime, general arguments based on mass conservation show that the thickness of the dry film decreases as the substrate velocity increases, unlike the behavior in the well-known Landau–Levich regime. This work focuses on colloidal dispersions, which deserve special attention. Indeed, <b>flow</b> <b>coating</b> is expected to draw first a solvent-saturated film of densely packed colloids, which further dries fully when air invades the pores of the solid film. We first develop a model based on the transport equations for binary mixtures, which can describe this phenomenon continuously, using appropriate boundary conditions and a criterion to take into account pore-emptying in the colloidal film. Extensive numerical simulations of the model then demonstrate two regimes for the deposit thickness {{as a function of the}} process parameters (substrate velocity, evaporation rate, bulk concentration, and particle size). We finally derive an analytical model based on simplified transport equations that can reproduce the output of our numerical simulations very well. This model can predict analytically the two observed asymptotic regimes and therefore unifies the models recently reported in the literature...|$|E

40|$|Slot coating, one of pre-metered coatings, is an {{indispensable}} process in IT industries manufacturing flat panel displays, secondary batteries, etc. The final {{goal of this}} coating process, as in other coating processes, is to deposit thin uniform coating liquid layer on the web or the substrate with good mechanical and optical properties. Dynamics of this process has been elucidated by many experimenters and accounted for theoretically by analysts {{with the aid of}} appropriate approximations (Sartor, 1990; Gates, 1999; Chu et al., 2006). One of interesting topics is to incorporate polymeric coating liquids with non-Newtonian characteristics in this process.

Thus, this paper examined the conformation of single polymer chain in coating bead regime of slot coating by combining Brownian dynamics (BD) with the conventional computational flow dynamics (CFD) simulations. Recent developments in direct visualization methods, coupled with Brownian dynamics simulations, have allowed the dynamics of single DNA molecules in flow fields to be studied with unprecedented details (Larson, 2005; Shaqfeh, 2005).
