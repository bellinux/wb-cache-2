50|$|Craig Strong, a {{professional}} photographer from Portland Oregon, invented the first Lensbaby lens by combining {{a vacuum cleaner}} <b>hose</b> <b>body</b> and a large format speed graphic lens. Strong redesigned the original prototype. He then partnered with entrepreneur Sam Pardue to form Lensbabies, LLC. The Original Lensbaby was launched in 2004 at the WPPI tradeshow. Images taken with the Original Lensbaby featured a 'sweet spot' of sharp focus surrounded by directional blur. This effect was achieved {{through the use of}} a single element lens. The Original Lensbaby used interchangeable drop-in apertures held in by a rubber o-ring.|$|E
25|$|The Interior Minister Mohamed Ibrahim {{announced}} that police used water hoses to disperse the campers. Yet, all videos and {{photos from the}} scenes of the raids never showed water or <b>hoses.</b> Tents and <b>bodies</b> were on fire, and the main mosque of Rabaa Al-Adawiya was burned with hundreds of unidentified bodies.|$|R
5000|$|The cobbler {{referred}} to in the title is actually the nickname used for 'Cholera'. There was a particularly bad cholera epidemic in 1831-32 (and later in 1848-9 and 1853). There were 1,533 deaths in Newcastle in the 1853 outbreak. It was a plague and as was treated as such. Emergency hospitals were opened, places of leisure (such as theatres) closed, ships quarantined, the streets were cleansed by <b>hoses</b> from fire-engines, <b>bodies</b> of victims were excluded from places of worship and graves had to be increased to not less than six feet deep." ...|$|R

60|$|The day {{was very}} warm, and the sun, bright and unclouded, shone {{fiercely}} {{down upon the}} open lists. Perhaps few men nowadays could bear the scorching heat of iron plates such as Myles wore, from which the body was only protected by a leathern jacket and <b>hose.</b> But men's <b>bodies</b> in those days were tougher and more seasoned to hardships of weather {{than they are in}} these our times. Myles thought no more of the burning iron plates that incased him than a modern soldier thinks of his dress uniform in warm weather. Nevertheless, he raised the umbril of his helmet to cool his face as he waited the coming of his opponent. He turned his eyes upward to the row of seats on the scaffolding above, and even in the restless, bewildering multitude of strange faces turned towards him recognized those that he knew: the Prince of Wales, his companions of the Scotland Yard household, the Duke of Clarence, the Bishop of Winchester, and some of the noblemen of the Earl of Mackworth's party, who had been buzzing about the Prince for the past month or so. But his glance swept over all these, rather perceiving than seeing them, and then rested upon a square box-like compartment not unlike a prisoner's dock in the courtroom of our day, for in the box sat his father, with the Earl of Mackworth upon one side and Sir James Lee upon the other. The blind man's face was very pale, but still wore its usual expression of calm serenity--the calm serenity of a blind face. The Earl was also very pale, and he kept his eyes fixed steadfastly upon Myles with a keen and searching look, as though to pierce to the very bottom of the young man's heart, and discover if indeed not one little fragment of dryrot of fear or uncertainty tainted the solid courage of his knighthood.|$|R
