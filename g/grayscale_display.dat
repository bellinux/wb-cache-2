50|$|To promote {{identical}} <b>grayscale</b> image <b>display</b> {{on different}} monitors and consistent hard-copy images from various printers, the DICOM committee developed a lookup table to display digitally assigned pixel values.

50|$|All {{of the new}} PS/2 {{graphics}} systems (whether MCGA, VGA, 8514, {{or later}} XGA) used a 15-pin D-sub connector for video out. This used analog RGB signals, rather than four or six digital color signals as on previous CGA and EGA monitors. The digital signals limited the color gamut to a fixed 16 or 64 color palette with no room for expansion. In contrast, any color depth (bits per primary) can be encoded into the analog RGB signals so the color gamut can be increased arbitrarily by using wider (more bits per sample) DACs and a more sensitive monitor. The connector was also compatible with analog <b>grayscale</b> <b>displays.</b> Unlike earlier systems (like MDA and Hercules) this was transparent to software, so all programs supporting the new standards could run unmodified whichever type of display was attached. (On the other hand, whether the display was color or monochrome was undetectable to software, so selection between application displays optimized for color or monochrome, in applications that supported both, required user intervention.) These <b>grayscale</b> <b>displays</b> were relatively inexpensive {{during the first few}} years the PS/2 was available, and they were very commonly purchased with lower-end models.|$|R

Grayscale lithography {{is a common}} production method used to facilitate the forming of lenses with different curvatures and depths. However, this approach is time consuming and expensive. This study proposes a method for overcoming these obstacles by integrating a digital micromirror device and microscope to supplant the traditional physical grayscale mask. This approach provides a simple and practical maskless optical lithography system. According to the results, the two adjacent <b>grayscales</b> <b>displayed</b> substantial differences between the high grayscale and influence the low grayscale that ultimately affected photoresist formation. Furthermore, we show that change of up to 150 % in the slope {{can be achieved by}} changing the grayscale gradient in the central zone and the ring profile.

40|$|Consistent {{presentation}} of digital radiographic images at all locations within a medical center can help ensure {{a high level}} of patient care. Currently, liquid crystal displays (LCDs) are the electronic display technology of choice for viewing medical images. As the inherent luminance (and thereby perceived contrast) properties of different LCDs can vary substantially, calibration of the luminance response of these displays is required to ensure that observer perception of an image is consistent on all displays. The digital imaging and communication in medicine (DICOM) <b>grayscale</b> standard <b>display</b> function (GSDF) defines the luminance response of a display such that an observer’s perception of image contrast is consistent throughout the pixel value range of a displayed image. The main purpose of this work is to review the theoretical and practical aspects of calibration of LCDs to the GSDF.

Methods: We recruited 19 radiologists and residents to compare the image quality of four liquid crystal displays, including 3 -megapixel Barco®, Eizo®, and NEC® displays and a 6 -megapixel Barco display. The evaluators were blinded to the manufacturers&# 39; names. Technical assessments were based on acceptance criteria and test patterns proposed by the American Association of Physicists in Medicine. Radiological assessments were performed on images from the American Association of Physicists in Medicine Task Group 18. They included X-ray images of the thorax, knee, and breast, a computed tomographic image of the thorax, and a magnetic resonance image of the brain. Image quality was scored on an analog scale (range 0 – 10). Statistical analysis was performed with repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results: The Barco 3 -megapixel display passed all acceptance criteria. The Eizo and NEC displays passed the acceptance criteria, except for the darkest pixel value in the <b>grayscale</b> <b>display</b> function. The Barco 6 -megapixel display failed criteria for the maximum luminance response and the veiling glare. Mean radiological assessment scores were 7. 8 ± 1. 1 (Barco 3 -megapixel), 7. 8 ± 1. 2 (Eizo), 8. 1 ± 1. 0 (NEC), and 8. 1 ± 1. 0 (Barco 6 -megapixel). No {{significant differences were found}} between displays.

40|$|Medical images {{produced}} by x-ray detectors, computed tomography (CT) scanners, and other modalities typically contain between 12 – 16  bits/pixel, which corresponds to 4, 096 – 65, 536 shades of gray.

For a long time medical LCDs only supported 8  bits or 256 shades of gray per pixel. With the introduction of medical displays optimized for mammography, the available number of gray scales increased to 1, 024. Recently, several manufacturers announced new display systems with higher bit depth.
