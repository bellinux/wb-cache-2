40|$|The poorly {{understood}} movements of sea turtles during the “lost years” of their early life history have been {{characterized as a}} “passive drifter” stage. Biologging technology allows us to study patterns of dispersal, but the small body size of young life stages requires particular consideration that such tagging does not significantly impede animal movements. We tested the effect of instrument attachment methods for mobile acoustic tracking of hatchling sea turtles, including a design that would be suitable for leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea). We obtained 8 -week-old hatchery-reared green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) (n = 12 individuals) and examined the effect of attaching Vemco V 5 acoustic tags. Each animal's swim speed, swimming depth, and stroke frequency were determined under three scenarios: control, direct Velcro® attachment to the carapace, and <b>harness</b> <b>attachment,</b> {{to determine if there}} was a significant difference amongst treatments. Turtle swimming speed was significantly slower during the middle period of the trial for the <b>harness</b> <b>attachment</b> compared with the control. No significant change in swim speed was observed when the tag was attached directly with Velcro®, and no significant change in dive depth was observed for either treatment compared to the control. Stroke frequency was significantly greater compared to the control at the end of the trial for the Velcro® attachment only, although there was no corresponding increase in swimming speed. This information can be used to design effective approaches for actively tracking free-ranging hatchling sea turtles to understand dispersal and survival of these vulnerable marine species...|$|E

40|$|Three {{species of}} {{biennial}} breeding southern hemisphere albatrosses-Diomedea sanfordi from the Chatham Islands, D. antipodensis from Antipodes Island and D. exulans from South Georgia-were tracked using CLS-Argos satellite system during the 1990 s. <b>Harness</b> <b>attachment</b> and duty cycling of transmitters enabled long-term deployments covering both the breeding and non-breeding ranges. The feeding ranges for breeding birds of each species were different. D. sanfordi foraged over continental shelves to the shelf edge, whereas D. antipodensis and D. exulans ranged widely over deep {{water to the}} shelf edge. Mapping of satellite-determined locations for D. sanfordi and D. antipodensis showed that the demarcation was between the 1000 and 2000 m undersea contour. Non-breeding D. sanfordi wintered over the Patagonian shelf or over the Chilean' shelf. There they were virtually confined to seas over the continental shelves of 1000 m, and on less steep slopes to 200 m depth. These data provide the best evidence yet of habitat preference and segregation consistent across breeding and non-breeding seasons for closely related seabirds...|$|E

The aim of the current investigation was to examine the kinetics and kinematics of shoulder and waist <b>harness</b> <b>attachment</b> points in relation to the acceleration phase of ST. Fourteen trained males completed normal and ST trials, loaded at 10 % reduction of sprint velocity. Sagittal plane kinematics from the trunk, hip, knee and ankle were measured, together with stance phase kinetics (third foot-strike). Kinetic and kinematic parameters were compared between harness attachments using one-way repeated measures analysis of variance. The results indicated that various kinetic differences were present between the normal and ST conditions. Significantly greater net horizontal mean force, net horizontal impulses, propulsive mean force and propulsive impulses were measured (p> 0. 05). Interestingly, the waist harness also led to greater net horizontal impulse when compared to the shoulder attachment (p = 0. 000). In kinematic terms, ST conditions significantly increased peak flexion in hip, knee and ankle joints compared to the normal trials (p< 0. 05). Results highlighted that the shoulder harness had a greater impact on trunk and knee joint kinematics when compared to the waist harness (p< 0. 05). In summary, waist harnesses appear to be the most suitable attachment point for the acceleration phase of sprinting. Sled towing with these attachments resulted in fewer kinematic alterations and greater net horizontal impulse when compared to the shoulder harness. Future research is necessary, in order to explore the long-term adaptations of these acute changes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} the interrelationships of self-congruity, functional image, and emotional attachment and loyalty. Specifically, this study tested hypotheses of self-congruity theory in the Islamic banking sector. Much of the previous studies of self-congruity have examined product, brand, and retailers contexts and not much has been explored {{in the context of}} banking sector. Questionnaires were distributed to customers of Islamic bank in the city. Results showed that self-congruity has a significant influence on functional image as well as emotional attachment. Functional image is found to have a stronger effect on emotional attachment. Also, self-congruity, functional image, and emotional image have significant influence on loyalty. Interestingly, emotional attachment is a very strong predictor of loyalty and in turn, self-congruity is a strong factor influencing emotional attachment. The key management implication is that Islamic banks should focus on strategies to <b>harness</b> customers’ emotional <b>attachment</b> with the banks...|$|R
40|$|The nomadic or {{dispersive}} {{movements of}} many Australian waterfowl {{in response to}} irregular environmental cues make satellite telemetry studies the only means by which these long-distance movements can be tracked in real time. Unlike some large-bodied soaring species, attaching satellite transmitters to small-bodied waterfowl (< 1 kg) is not straightforward because ducks have high wing loadings and need to maintain active flapping to stay aloft. In the present paper, we detail one <b>harness</b> design and <b>attachment</b> method that enabled us to track grey teal (Anas gracilis) for up to 879 days. In addition, we detail rates of data loss, changes in data quality over time and variation in data quality from solar-powered satellite-tags deployed on ducks in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Up to 68 % of all locational fixes have a nominal accuracy of less than 1 km, and satellite-tags deployed on wild birds can provide up to 22 location fixes per day and store enough energy during the day to run continuously throughout the night...|$|R
40|$|We placed light-level geolocators on 17 Rusty Blackbirds (Euphagus carolinus) in 2009 {{to track}} their migrations from nest sites near Anchorage, Alaska to {{wintering}} areas and back. We recaptured {{three of these}} birds in 2010 and found they departed breeding areas {{during the first half}} of September, spent 72 – 84 days migrating to overwintering areas, but only 16 – 30 days on their northward migration to Alaska. Birds took similar Central Flyway routes on southward and northward migrations, which were not previously described for this species. The birds used a series of stopover sites across the prairie region from southern Saskatchewan to Iowa over a 4 to 5 week period on their southward migration to wintering areas that spanned from South Dakota to northern Louisiana. We found upon recapture in 2010, the geolocator <b>attachment</b> <b>harnesses</b> had abraded the surrounding feathers on all three birds. This coupled with the low return rate (18 %) for instrumented birds indicates a better harness method must be developed before this technology is more widely used on Rusty Blackbird...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use a}} social {{practice}} approach to explore men’s experience of Football Fans in Training (FFIT), a group-based weight management programme for men that <b>harnesses</b> men’s symbolic <b>attachment</b> to professional football clubs to engage them in lifestyle change. FFIT is delivered by community coaches in clubs’ stadia and is gender-sensitised in relation to context, content and style of delivery. Using a ‘toolkit’ of concepts {{from the work of}} Bourdieu, Goffman and Durkheim we analysed data from 13 focus group discussions with participants, and fieldwork notes from programme observations to investigate the appeal and success of FFIT, and how it worked to support change. Our analysis builds on our work on the importance of shared symbolic commitment to the football club and being with “men like me” to understand how the interaction context facilitated ‘effervescent’ experiences. These experiences encouraged men to make changes to their diet and physical activity, talk about them, practice performing them and implement them in their lives. Thus a social practice approach illuminated the social processes through which lifestyle change was achieved, and we argue that it can deepen and enrich both intervention design and evaluation...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{widespread}} and {{increasing use of}} solar-powered satellite transmitters to tag wild birds, there are few published articles that detail how transmitters should be attached to different species and even fewer assessments of the overall field success of telemetry projects. The scarcity of this information {{makes it difficult to}} plan and budget for telemetry projects effectively. In this paper we present relevant information from a study involving a total of 47 individual ducks of two Afrotropical anatid species, Egyptian Goose Alopochen aegyptiaca and Red-billed Teal Anas erythrorhyncha, using solar-powered GPS satellite transmitters of two different sizes (30 g and 22 g respectively) at three very different southern African sites (Strandfontein wastewater treatment works in the Western Cape Province of South Africa, Barberspan Nature Reserve in the North West Province of South Africa, and Lake Manyame in north-central Zimbabwe). We present a full description of <b>harness</b> design and <b>attachment</b> and a survivorship analysis of the transmitters. Our results suggest that the 30 g units last longer than the 22 g units, with approximately 60 % and 30 % respectively of these PTTs lasting longer than a year; 45 % and 5 % respectively lasting longer than two years; and 20 % and 0 % respectively lasting longer than three years. We strongly encourage the publication of comparable data sets so that future studies that rely on telemetry data can be planned with a realistic set of assumptions and limitations in mind...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2002 Avian {{movement}} behavior provides {{insight on}} patterns of {{regional and local}} fidelity, habitat and resource requirements, the scale at which individuals perceive the landscape, and the relative influence of the spatial array of resources. Shorebirds (suborder: Charadrii) are a diverse and mobile group of wetland associated species. Large numbers of shorebirds utilize seasonally flooded wetland habitats in the Willamette Valley of northwest Oregon; however, there is little information on fidelity and movements of birds in the region or at other inland sites. Thus, we quantified winter fidelity and movement patterns of radio-tagged Dunlin (Calidris alpina) and Killdeer (Charadrius vociferus) in the Willamette Valley in 1998 - 1999 and 1999 - 2000. Prior to field telemetry, we evaluated use of a leg-loop <b>harness</b> design for <b>attachment</b> of radio-transmitters. Comparisons between captive Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri) fitted with a harness package and a control group indicated {{no significant differences in}} behavior. In addition, observations of wild Killdeer and Dunlin indicated prolonged harness retention and no adverse effects on behavior. Therefore, we determined that the modified harness design was a suitable method for attachment of transmitters to shorebirds. Monitoring of radio-tagged Dunlin and Killdeer indicated interspecific differences in regional fidelity and residency patterns. Dunlin exhibited a high degree of regional fidelity and in most cases remained within the Valley {{for the duration of the}} winter. In contrast, Killdeer departed the study area throughout the winter and the population segment monitored was composed of winter residents (63...|$|R
50|$|In {{recent years}} {{there have been}} advancements in how the patient can {{increase}} the duration of therapy safely to make for more effective treatment. Body-weight support (BWS) systems or unweighting devices are starting to {{become more and more}} popular and {{have been the subject of}} much study.BWS systems can be used prior to the patient gaining adequate motor control or having sufficient strength to fully bear weight. The patient will wear a specialized trunk harness with adjustable straps, which attach to an overhead suspension system. The <b>harness</b> and its <b>attachments</b> support a certain amount of the patient’s body weight. Gait training techniques that utilize a BWS system appear to be promising in their ability to improve and possibly restore walking function, as demonstrated in individuals suffering from incomplete spinal cord injuries. A BWS system can be used on a treadmill or over ground for gait training. Body-weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT) enables individuals with motor deficits that have rendered them incapable of completely supporting their own body weight to practice and experience locomotion at physiological speeds. Depending on the severity of the person's impairment, one or more physiotherapists may be present to assist in maintaining the patient’s appropriate posture and moving their legs through as kinematically physiological a gait pattern as possible. Recently, electromechanical devices such as the Hocoma Lokomat robot-driven gait orthosis have been introduced with the intention of reducing the physical labour demands on therapists. This system uses a computer-controlled exoskeleton to repeatedly and consistently guide lower-limb movements, making BWSTT a more feasible option for long-term and widespread use.|$|R
40|$|Animal-borne logging or {{telemetry}} {{devices are}} widely used for measurements of physiological and movement data from free-living animals. For such measurements to be relevant, however, {{it is essential that}} the devices themselves do not affect the data of interest. A recent meta-analysis reported an overall negative effect of these devices on the birds that bear them, i. e. on nesting productivity, clutch size, nest initiation date, offspring quality, body condition, flying ability, foraging behaviours, energy expenditure and survival rate. Method of <b>attachment</b> (<b>harness,</b> collar, glue, anchor, implant, breast-mounted or tailmount) had no influence on the strength of these effects but anchored and implanted transmitters had the highest reported rates of device-induced mortality. Furthermore, external devices, but not internal devices, caused an increase in ‘device-induced behaviour’ (comfort behaviours such as preening, fluffing and stretching, and unrest activities including unquantifiable ‘active’ behaviours). These findings suggest that, with the exception of device-induced behaviour, external attachment is preferable to implantation. In the present study we undertake a meta-analysis of 183 estimates of device impact from 39 studies of 36 species of bird designed to explicitly compare the effects of externally attached and surgically implanted devices on a range of traits, including condition, energy expenditure and reproduction. In contrast to a previous study, we demonstrate that externally attached devices have a consistent detrimental effect (i. e. negative influences on body condition, reproduction, metabolism and survival), whereas implanted devices have no consistent effect. We also show that the magnitude of the negative effect of externally attached devices decreases with time. We therefore conclude that device implantation is preferable to external attachment, providing that the risk of mortality associated with the anaesthesia and surgery required for implantation can be mitigated. We recommend that studies employing external devices use devices that can be borne for long periods, and, wherever possible, deploy devices in advance of the time period of interest. Craig R.
