40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{different}} practical distributed schemes {{to solve the}} rank failure problem in the compute and forward (CMF) -based multi-user multi-relay networks without central coordinator, in which the relays have no prior information about each other. First, a new relaying strategy based on CMF, named incremental compute-and-forward (ICMF), is proposed that performs quite well {{in terms of the}} outage probability. We show that the distributed ICMF scheme can even outperform the achievable rate of centralized optimal CMF in strong enough <b>inter</b> <b>relay</b> links, with much less complexity. Then, as the second scheme, amplify-forward and compute (AFC) is introduced in which the equations are recovered in the destination rather than in the relays. Finally, ICMF and AFC schemes are combined to present hybrid compute-amplify and forward (HCAF) relaying scheme, which takes advantages of both ICMF, and AFC and improves the performance of the ICMF considerably. We evaluate the performance of the proposed strategies in terms of the outage probability and compare the results with those of the conventional CMF strategy, the Decode and Forward (DF) strategy, and also the centralized optimal CMF. The results indicate the substantial superiority of the proposed schemes compared with the conventional schemes, specially for high number of users and relays.

40|$|IRC (<b>Inter</b> <b>Relay</b> Chat) {{falls under}} the form of media called CMC (Computer-mediated communication); however, this form of media lacks such {{features}} as co-presence and simultaneity (Lark and Brennan, 1991). Therefore, CMC {{is said to be}} a limited form of media, compared to face-to-face communication (King, 1996). With regard to CMC, studies on turn-taking systems have been examined in the Western context. Hence, in this paper, I would like to argue that, to some extent, Japanese CMC has its own turn-taking system. One of the unique characteristics of the Japanese turn-taking system is the coconstruction of turns by more than two participants, in which one of the participants utters only the former part of the statement, anticipating that the latter part will be completed by the other participants (Mizutani, 1993). In Japanese, co-construction is possible partly because of the language 2 ̆ 7 s syntactic structures, in which syllables can easily be attached one after the other. This type of construction is called turn-projectability and the individual part of a sentence is called TCU (Turn Construction Unit; Szatrowski, 1993). Focusing on TCU, this paper studies how a turn is taken and examines how turn-taking in IRC is different from that in face-to face communication. On the basis of 3000 turns extracted from the IRC of “Yahoo Japan,” I first counted the frequency of turn-taking strategy by initiations, such as connectives, fillers, and responsive markers as discourse markers, and then compared it with the frequency of turn-taking strategy found in face-to-face communication. Consequently, it was clarified that the initiations in CMC are not as frequent as they are in face-to-face conversation. A further observation of the data showed that TCU tends to appear instead of initiation. Through a qualitative analysis of each TCU, it can be said that primer turn, which ends in the topical marker “wa,” draws a response from other participants in the cyber community and makes the community livelier. Furthermore, in the case of a narrative, a participant connects each turn by using the conjunctive suffix “-te,” in order to draw the other 2 ̆ 7 s response to the story, thus contributing to the vividness of communication in cyber space. In conclusion, TCU effectively compensates for the leanness of CMC, and the various TCU can be unique and powerful tools for turn-taking strategy in Japanese CMC...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a classic relay channel {{which consists of}} a source, a relay and a destination node and investigates the energy-spectral efficiency tradeoff under three different relay protocols: amplify-and-forward; decode-and-forward; and compress-and-forward. We focus on a cellular scenario where a neighbour base station can potentially act as the relay node to help on the transmissions of the source base station to its assigned mobile device. We employ a realistic power model and introduce a framework to evaluate the performance of different communication schemes for various deployments in a practical macrocell scenario. The results of this paper demonstrate that the proposed framework can be applied flexibly in practical scenarios to identify the pragmatic energy-spectral efficiency tradeoffs and choose the most appropriate scheme optimising the overall performance of <b>inter</b> base station <b>relaying</b> communications...|$|R
