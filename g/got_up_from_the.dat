5|$|When the {{two sides}} met in late-February, {{a week before the}} brawl game, during the third period, Flyers winger Mark Recchi was {{following}} Martin Havlat of the Senators when he crossed into the Philadelphia defensive zone. As this happened, Recchi hooked Havlat, causing both of the players to collide and fall into the boards. When Havlat <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ice, angered by Recchi's hook, he took his stick above him and slashed Recchi, hitting him in the face.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of February 25, 1855, Baker entered the Stanwix Hall saloon with Jim Turner and Paudeen McLaughlin to confront Poole having {{threatened}} Morrissey with a gun during an argument only hours before. Walking up to Poole, Baker spat {{in his face and}} then pulled a Colt revolver but accidentally shot himself in the arm as he stepped back to draw the weapon. Dropping to the floor, he did manage to fire a second shot hitting Poole in the leg and similarly incapacitating him. Both men eventually <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> floor, however Baker managed to get to Poole first and pistol whipped him back to the ground. Baker then shot Poole twice, once in the stomach and the second in his chest, and left the saloon.|$|E
500|$|Orr {{was also}} known for his mean streak. Former coach Don Cherry recounts an {{incident}} one night in Los Angeles during a game that the Bruins were losing. With a minute to go, Orr pulled one of the Bruins off the ice, left the bench and attacked a Los Angeles Kings player. Asked why, Orr said to Cherry [...] "He was laughing at us." [...] According to Cherry, he fought a lot. On another occasion in November 1967, Orr was clipped in the face by a stick from the Toronto Maple Leafs' Brian Conacher. Boston teammate Johnny McKenzie flattened Conacher from behind and started punching Conacher. Orr, cut and bleeding, <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ice, pulled MacKenzie off Conacher and started punching Conacher. Conacher, who was not fighting back, was also sucker-punched by the Bruins' Ken Hodge. Orr would be booed in Toronto from that date onwards. Orr was frequently compared to Brad Park, who played a similar style to Orr and later succeeded Orr as Boston's top defenceman, and the two often fought each other on-ice, fueling the bitter rivalry between the Bruins and New York Rangers. Park said [...] "I {{saw no reason to}} be upset because I was rated second to Bobby Orr. After all, Orr not only was the top defenceman in the game but he was considered the best player ever to {{put on a pair of}} skates. There was nothing insulting about being rated number two to such a super superstar".|$|E

2500|$|After the fight, Griffin <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> canvas, {{left the}} cage, and jogged {{out of the}} arena.

2500|$|Hill alleged lurid {{details about}} her time with Thomas at the Department of Education: [...] "He spoke about acts {{that he had}} seen in pornographic films {{involving}} such matters as women having sex with animals and films showing group sex or rape scenes...On several occasions, Thomas told me graphically of his own sexual prowess." [...] Hill also said that the following incident occurred later after they had both moved to new jobs at the EEOC: [...] "Thomas was drinking a Coke in his office, he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> table at which we were working, went over to his desk to get the Coke, looked at the can and asked, 'Who has put pubic hair on my Coke?'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Of several 299 {{games that}} were bowled on {{televised}} championships, {{the most memorable}} occurred on April 4, 1970 when Don Johnson defeated Dick Ritger to win the 1970 Firestone Tournament of Champions at Riviera Lanes in Fairlawn, Ohio. [...] With 11 strikes already down, he threw his 12th ball, stepped back and dropped to the floor. [...] The ball hit the pocket, but the 10-pin remained standing. [...] Johnson, still on the floor, briefly lowered his face into his hands, then stood up to a thunderous ovation. Johnson's wife Mary Anne was also crying prior to the shot, and crying even more after Johnson <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> floor. Along with the trophy and $25,000 check from Firestone, Johnson also received the 10-pin that denied him both an extra $10,000 and a new Mercury Cougar automobile for a perfect game (In the post-match interview with the Johnsons, Mary Anne was holding the pin). [...] The footage {{of this has been}} replayed many dozens of times in flashback segments on PBA telecasts. The online bowling channel Xtra Frame has named this the most memorable moment of the events history.|$|E

2500|$|In one of {{the most}} famous matches in {{professional}} wrestling history, Foley received numerous injuries and took two dangerous and highly influential bumps. The first one came as both wrestlers were brawling on top of the cell, and The Undertaker threw Mankind from the top of the cage from a height of (22ft [...] including angle of the fall) and sent him crashing through the Spanish announcers' table, prompting announcer Jim Ross to famously shout, [...] "Good God Almighty! Good God Almighty! That killed him! As God as my witness, he is broken in half!". Foley remained motionless underneath debris, while The Undertaker remained on top of the cell staring down. Terry Funk was the first person on the scene, followed by WWE's resident doctor, Fran√ßois Petit, and various others, including a concerned-looking Vince McMahon. Foley was placed on a stretcher and began to be wheeled out to the arena. While The Undertaker was still atop the cage, the cage actually had to be raised in order to make room for the stretcher to reach Foley as he was lying on the opposite side of the ring to the entrance aisle. Moments later, there was commotion on the entrance ramp as Foley <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> stretcher and proceeded to make his way back to the cage, climbing to the top of the cell, with The Undertaker doing likewise (this time they both climbed the cage surprisingly quickly despite Foley having suffered a dislocated shoulder due to the fall, and The Undertaker wrestling with a broken foot that night). With both men back on the top of the cell the match resumed.|$|E

Ulick shook himself, sat down quietly, filled a bumper, and pushed the bottle to me. 'There, you young donkey,' said he, 'sup that; and let's hear no more of your braying.' ...|$|R
60|$|One by one {{my companions}} sought their blankets, leaving the shadows, the dying embers, the slow-rising moan {{of the night}} wind to me. Old Moze <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> among <b>the</b> other hounds and limped into my tent, where I heard him groan as he lay down. Don, Sounder, and Ranger were fast asleep in well-earned rest. Shep, one of the pups, whined and impatiently tossed his short chain. Remembering {{that he had not}} been loose all day, I unbuckled his collar and let him go.|$|R

60|$|He <b>got</b> <b>up</b> rather early, {{but when}} he went out a big fire burned between the {{parallel}} hearth logs. Aromatic wood-smoke hung about the camp in a thin blue haze. There was an appetizing smell of cooking, and Carrie <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> beside <b>the</b> logs as he advanced. She gave him a cheerful glance, and then stood looking past him to the east. Mist streamed out of the deep valley and rolled across the climbing pines; in the distance, snow cut, softly blue, against the dazzling sky. Carrie looked fresh and vigorous. There was color in her face {{and her eyes were}} bright.|$|R

60|$|Oh, my poor darling! my {{innocent}} martyr! I {{understood it}} at last. The false name {{in which he}} had married me; the terrible words he had spoken when he had warned me to respect his secret; the still more terrible doubt that he felt of me at that moment--it was all intelligible to my sympathies, it was all clear to my understanding, now. I <b>got</b> <b>up</b> again <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sofa, strong in a daring resolution which the Scotch Verdict had suddenly kindled in me--a resolution at once too sacred and too desperate to be confided, in the first instance, to any other than my husband's ear.|$|R

Mr. Chapman began to talk in a loud voice about the {{situation}} in the House of Commons. He guffawed at his adversaries. The word doctrinaire--word full of terror to <b>the</b> British mind--reappeared <b>from</b> time to time between his explosions. An alliterative prefix served as an ornament of oratory. He hoisted the Union Jack on the pinnacles of Thought. The inherited stupidity of the race--sound English common sense he jovially termed it--was shown to be the proper bulwark for Society.|$|R
60|$|Job. He {{had to have}} a job. He <b>got</b> stiffly <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> iron bed, painfully drew on his shoes, after {{inspecting}} the hole in the sole of the left shoe and the ripped seam {{at the back of the}} right. He pulled tight the paper-thin overcoat which he had bought at a second-hand dealer's shop, and dared a Chicago blizzard, with needles of snow thundering by on a sixty-mile gale. Through a street of unutterably drab stores and saloons he plowed to the Unallied Taxicab Company's garage. He felt lonely, cold, but he observed with ceaseless interest the new people, different people, who sloped by him in the dun web of the blizzard. The American marveled at a recently immigrated Slav's astrachan cap.|$|R
5000|$|In August 2009, plate umpire Rapuano ejected Philadelphia Phillies {{center fielder}} Shane Victorino for arguing balls and strikes from his {{position}} in the outfield. After calling a Rodrigo L√≥pez pitch a ball, Rapuano claimed he then warned Victorino for gesturing with his arms. According to Rapuano, Victorino repeated the gesture, leading to the ejection. While Victorino did not admit to gesturing twice, he did say, [...] "I've got to hold myself accountable. It's not something {{that you should be}} doing, but I've done it 1,000 times this year. It's not the first time -- and I'm not trying to show anybody <b>up.</b> Just things <b>got</b> built <b>up</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> half-inning before that, and it's {{just one of those things}} I let my emotions get the best of me." ...|$|R

As soon as the {{platform}} was clear of the other passengers who had alighted, a respectably-dressed woman <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> one of <b>the</b> seats and came up to Fan. [...] "You are Miss Affleck," [...] she said, with a furtive glance at the girl's face. [...] "Miss Starbrow sent me to meet you. She is going to stay a few days with friends just outside of Twickenham. Will you please come this way?" ...|$|R
60|$|Foster got in {{and stood}} at the window until the porter went away. People were {{running up and down}} looking for places, but he had no time to lose.

He could not see the porter, and when two or three passengers ran <b>up</b> <b>got</b> down <b>from</b> <b>the</b> step. Next moment the whistle blew, the engine snorted, and the train rolled out of the station.|$|R
60|$|Stewart {{looked as}} if he had spared the horse his weight on many a mile of that rough ascent. His boots were {{evidence}} of it. His heavy flannel shirt, wet through with perspiration, adhered closely to his shoulders and arms, so that every ripple of muscle plainly showed. His face was black, except round the temples and forehead, where it was bright red. Drops of sweat, running off his blackened hands dripped to <b>the</b> ground. He <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>from</b> examining <b>the</b> lame foot, and then threw off the saddle. The black horse snorted and lunged for the watering-pool. Stewart let him drink a little, then with iron arms dragged him away. In this action the man's lithe, powerful form impressed Madeline with a wonderful sense of muscular force. His brawny wrist was bare; his big, strong hand, first clutching the horse's mane, then patting his neck, had a bruised knuckle, and one finger was bound up. That hand expressed as much gentleness and thoughtfulness for the horse as it had strength to drag him back from too much drinking at a dangerous moment.|$|R
