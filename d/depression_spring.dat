40|$|Determining {{sustainable}} {{water resource}} utilization rates {{is an important}} problem faced by regulatory agencies all around the world. One of the key parameters in determining accurate water budgeting schemes is the rate of water resource replenishment, or ‘recharge’ in groundwater systems. Fundamental questions regarding groundwater recharge include: What {{is the source of}} recharge? What is the spatial distribution of recharge? What is the annual average recharge rate, from potentially disparate sources in disparate areas? Answers to these questions can be gained through combining physical and chemical hydrogeological research tools, including stable isotopic compositions. Land-use intensification, including significant increases in dairying, has placed a priority on developing water resource management practices throughout New Zealand. Here we present the first compilation of delta oxygen- 18 and delta hydrogen- 2 values from individual precipitation events, local surface waters, <b>depression</b> <b>springs,</b> and groundwaters from the greater-Christchurch area. A variety of analytical methods were used in an effort to evaluate the potential use of stable isotopic compositions as tracers of surface-groundwater interaction in the local hydrologic cycle. The results of this thesis found the isotopic variability of Christchurch precipitation to be highly varied. Back-trajectory analysis of single precipitation events exhibit pathways arriving from three principal sources: the Southern Pacific Ocean, the Tasman Sea, and the Tropical Pacific Ocean. Separately, delta oxygen- 18 and delta hydrogen- 2 values values from these sources show three distinct local meteoric water lines, which are determined to be largely affected by the environmental conditions present in these areas at the time water vapour formation. Intra-storm variation of extra-tropical cyclones support these findings as significant changes in deuterium excess as moisture sources change with southward movement of the low pressure system. Three line-conditioned tests were subsequently developed to compare the relationship between monthly surface rainfall, surface water, and groundwater samples to the respective moisture origins. Surface rainfall, rainfall infiltration, surface waters, and groundwaters all exhibit the least amount of deviation from the Southern Pacific Ocean local meteoric water line. These observations suggest the principle moisture source to Christchurch to be from west-south westerly flow from the mid-latitudes. However, these similarities do not make partitioning their relative contributions to the groundwater system easy. Previous physical and isotopic investigations have shown the dominant sources of recharge to the Christchurch Groundwater System (CGS) are alpine rivers and local precipitation of which there is statistically significant difference with respect to delta oxygen- 18 values. A binary single-isotope mixing model allows for quantification of the relative contributions of alpine river and precipitation derived inputs to local <b>depression</b> <b>springs.</b> The isotopic model indicates that approximately 80 % of spring discharge was derived from alpine rivers, in good agreement with recently published physical mass balance model results. Deep groundwater flow paths however show groundwater to flow from the Central Canterbury Plains to the CGS. Potentially including losses from the upper Waimakariri River reaches. If included, this places a net recharge amount to the CGS water budget, which if using losses from only the lower Waimakariri River, there is a net loss. Losses from the upper reaches and subsequent groundwater flow into the CGS are likely as there have been no observed declines in groundwater levels even though there is currently a net loss by only using recharge components within the CGS. Ultimately, recharge from groundwater movement from the Central Canterbury Plains may play significant role; however, a much more sophisticated geochemical model is needed to test these theories and determine contributions. This research demonstrates the utility of stable isotopes as tracers of hydrogeological processes, particularly in shallow groundwater, and their potential contributions to the water resource allocation decision making process...|$|R

40|$|The {{origin of}} waters from small springs {{located at the}} hyper-arid {{northern}} coast of Chile, {{in the vicinity of}} Antofagasta, is discussed after hydrogeochemical and isotopic studies and supported by groundwater flow hydrodynamic considerations. Spring water is brackish to saline, with electrical conductivity ranging from 2 to 25 mS/cm. Chemical and water isotope data (O- 18 and H- 2) show that the rainfall events that produced part of the recharge could correspond to wetter conditions than at present. Their origin could be related to the emplacement of warm sea currents facing the coast of northern Chile, possibly associated to incursions of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Radiocarbon dating and preliminary groundwater hydraulic calculations indicate that these spring waters could be remnants of a more significant recharge in the Cordillera de la Costa than that produced today during the less arid period about 5, 000 to 3, 000 years ago.

40|$|It is {{suggested}} that in a localized remnant of Kalahari sand at Dufuya, central Zimbabwe, groundwater flows in an integrated pattern inherited from the paleochannel network of the underlying gneiss. Contact springs occur at discrete localities along the Kalahari sand/gneiss boundary and are associated with spring sapping and land surface subsidence. Subsidence is presumed {{to be due to}} preferential solute removal by leaching and dissolution as a result of concentration of groundwater flow within the buried paleochannel network and the location of the springs is presumed to occur where the paleochannel network intersects the Kalahari sand/gneiss boundary.

Type 72 has a telescopic carrying handle molded {{into the bottom of}} the mine and a large diameter filler plug on the side just above the handle position. The mine has a crimp around the top edge where the mine body meets the pressure plate. The mine contains 5.4 kg of 50:50 RDX/TNT and is actuated when pressure of 300 kg deforms the flexible plastic pressure plate long enough to release the cocked striker fuze. When the pressure plate is moved approximately 9 mm downwards it exerts pressure on the fuze. If fuzed with the T-72 clear plastic-cased blast resistant fuze, pressure on the top of the fuze will depress the casing which will revolve due to the <b>depression</b> of the <b>spring</b> which is attached to the casing. The revolution is controlled by lugs on the inner fuze assembly which fit in grooves in the fuze casing. When the fuze casing is revolved and depressed sufficiently, the two retaining balls to will fall away in groove in the outer casing, which releases the striker. The striker is driven down by the spring, initiating the detonator, which in turn initiates the booster and the main charge. The mine is blast resistant since rapid depression of the fuze will push the fuze casing straight down without any revolution. The lugs on the inner fuze assembly will then slide into vertical groves instead of the diagonal ones. The striker retaining balls will then be prevented from coming in line with the groves in the outer casing and the striker will not be released. Instead the pressure plate will bounce back into its original position.|$|R
40|$|Mickey Springs in the Alvord Desert, {{southeast}} Oregon, {{is analogous}} to other Basin and Range hydrothermal systems where the requisite conditions of heat source and permeable pathways are met through crustal thinning due to normal faulting. This study examines the morphology and lifespan of near-surface spring features through use of ground penetrating radar, thermoluminescence (TL) dating, and elevation modeling. Duration of hydrothermal activity at Mickey Springs has not previously been determined, and age determinations of sinter at the site are conflicting. The reason for and timing of this change in silica saturation in the hydrothermal fluid has not been resolved. Three morphologies of silica sinter deposition have been identified at Mickey Springs. These are (1) well-sorted, fine-grained sandstone with ripple marks, cross beds and preserved root casts, to poorly-sorted conglomerate of primarily basalt clasts, both cemented by coeval silica deposition, (2) large depressions (12 - 32 m diameter) rimmed with sinter, characterized by fine silt and clay blanketing a sinter apron and infilling the central depression, and (3) quaquaversal sinter mounds identified by outcropping pool-edge sinter typically surrounding a shallow depression of loose sediment. Silica-cemented sandstone and conglomerate were the first features formed by coeval hydrothermal processes at the site, and were emplaced prior to 30 kya as suggested by structural and stratigraphic relationships. Structure between two interacting fault tips may have constrained the extent of silica cementation. By 30 kya, a left-stepping fault oriented roughly north/south further constrained the near-surface permeable zone. TL dates from sediment stratigraphically below and above sinter aprons around mounds and <b>depressions</b> (former <b>spring</b> vents) indicate sinter deposition between 30 and 20 kya. Location of these features was dictated by development of the left-stepping fault. As pluvial Lake Alvord filled {{at the end of}} the Pleistocene, lake sediment filled most vents, which were largely inactive, with fine-grained silt and clay. Today, hydrothermal activity persists in two modes: (1) The current high-temperature springs, steam vents and mudpots concentrated in a 50 x 50 m area south of the sinter mounds and depressions, and (2) scattered springs and steam vents that exploit previous permeable pathways that once provided the hydrothermal fluid which precipitated the sinter aprons. Currently there is no active silica sinter deposition at Mickey Springs. Structures and stratigraphic relationships identified through this study favor a transport-limited and structurally controlled model of fluid transport. Sinter deposition is determined to have occurred before the most recent highstand of pluvial Lake Alvord. A climate driven model, where groundwater recharge from pluvial Lake Alvord circulates to a deep heat source and enhances spring discharge, is not supported by these findings, as no evidence was found for sinter precipitation after the drying of the lake. Future studies of other hydrothermal systems in the Basin and Range may reveal that permeable pathways along local structures are the primary drivers in this region...|$|R
40|$|The geology of the Victoria Range and the Maruia Upper Grey <b>depression</b> in <b>Springs</b> Junction {{district}} has been examined with {{particular emphasis on}} metamorphisms and structures. The 'Z?' sediments in the Victoria Range are correlated with the Aorere Group of NW Nelson {{on the basis of}} their consistency with Cooper's (1975) Lower Paleozoic sedimentary model, and Shelley's (1975) paired metamorphic belt model, These sediments have been deformed and metamorphosed twice, the first regional metamorphism is considered to be related to an Upper Ordovician Orogeny, and the second metamorphism thought to be associated with the Tuhua Orogeny. The latter metamorphism was at temperatures ranging from 400 ° to 550 ° C, and pressures not exceeding 2 to 3 kb. The volcanics and volcanogenic sediments of the Koura Formation are correlated with the Haupiri Group of NW Nelson also {{on the basis of their}} consistency with Cooperis (1975) sedimentary and shelley’ s (1975) paired metamorphic belt models. These rocks have been metamorphosed under P-T conditions of 350 ° to 450 ° C, and moderate to high pressure. This metamorphism is considered to be related to the Upper Ordovician Orogeny. The Lower Paleozoic (Cambrian? - Upper Ordovician) deposits in the Maruia-Upper Grey depression are correlated with the Mt. Arthur Group of NW Nelson. These rocks were regionally metamorphosed during the Tuhua Orogeny under conditions of 350 ° to 640 ° C, and not less than 4 to 6 kb. The deformation accompanying this metamorphism has generated three orders of folds. a) a NE-trending, gently plunging, and inclined major anticline, b) microscopic folds whose attitudes are similar to that of the major anticline, and c) microscopic crenulations whose axial planes are oriented parallel to the axial plane of the major anticline. The Koura Volcanics, the Victoria Range rocks, and the Lower Paleozoic sediments of the Maruia-Upper Grey depression were juxtaposed by movement(s) of the Koura Fault- a proposed Tuhuan major structure which coincided with the Tuhuan median boundary. The Lower Paleozoic rocks of the Maruia-Upper Grey Valley were again metamorphosed during the Rangitata Orogeny. The thermal metamorphism at 500 ° to 580 ° C, and 1. 5 to. 2. 5 kb was accompanied by an episode of deformation which resulted in the microscopic folding of one limb of the microscopic crenulations produced during the Tuhua Orogeny. The Rangitatan event was closely followed by dextral movement(s) along the Kaura Fracture System which resulted in the folding about a vertical axis of the Victoria Range meta-sediments and the Lower Paleozoic sequence bordering the major fracture. The deformed Victoria Range rocks were subsequently refolded about a gently plunging or horizontal axis. The formation of the Rahu Fault and sinistral movement(s) along this major structure during or subsequent to the Rangitata Orogeny has displaced the Mesozoic rocks in the Brown Grey Valley. The Lower Paleozoic sediments in the Maruia-Upper Grey depression were refolded about a gently plunging, N-S trending axis during the Kaikoura Orogeny. In addition, renewed activities of the Rahu Fault have displaced the Lower (?) Tertiary rocks west of Springs Junction...|$|R
40|$|Seasonal {{variations}} of mood, behavior and physiology {{have been of}} increasing interest. At least two different seasonal rhythms seem to exist: Descriptions of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) with increased weight, increased sleep and fatigue during winter have attracted attention in academic psychiatry and in the general public the last two decades. In addition to such a difference in mood, weight and sleep between summer and winter, many studies describe a spring and fall increase in frequency of suicides and of admissions to hospital for mood disorders. In searching for a possible etiology for these seasonal changes, the main {{focus has been on}} variations in length of day. The objective of this thesis was to study the existence and pattern of seasonal variation in some forms of behavior and of psychiatric illness among children and adults in Norway. Possible statistical connections between seasonal {{variations of}} behavior and changes in length of day and the influences of latitude, sex and age were also studied. The monthly numbers of incidents in different groups were studied: All suicides in Norway 1969 - 96 (N= 14. 503), admissions to hospital for depression and mania in some hospitals 1992 - 96 (N= 4. 341), all violent episodes recorded by the police in Norway 1991 - 97 (N= 82. 537), all patient-staff incidents in a psychiatric department 1990 - 97 (N= 502), all telephone calls to the Red Cross help-line for children and adolescents in Norway 1996 - 98 (N= 691. 787 calls, 220. 602 conversations) and in Trondheim, Norway 1991 - 97 (N= 80. 983 calls, 22. 698 conversations) were included in the thesis. The monthly frequencies of these incidents were compared to an expected equal daily frequency of incidents through the year. Changes with increasing age and increasing latitude were examined. Correlations between the monthly frequencies of incidents and the length of day, with maximum impact at midsummer, and correlations between the monthly frequencies of incidents and the speed of change in length of day, with maximum impact at the equinoxes, were also studied. In this thesis, an increased activity in April-June and in October-November is described for all the groups that were studied. In summer and winter there is less activity than {{in the rest of the}} year. Among children calling the help-line, a steady diminishing seasonal variation in number of calls with increasing age from 7 to 17 years of age and an increasing seasonal variation in number of calls with increasing latitude were found. Also the seasonal variation of violence increases with increasing latitude in Norway. Among men there is a correlation between the monthly number of suicides and the monthly number of admissions for mania and a correlation between the monthly number of suicides and the monthly number of admissions for depression. Among women there is a diminishing seasonal variation of admissions for depressions with increasing age. The monthly frequency of violence in Norway and the monthly frequency of calls to the Red Cross help-Line for children and adolescents correlated with a delay of 1 - 2 months with the monthly change in length of day with maximum impact at the equinoxes. The results in the thesis correspond with earlier studies describing an increase in the frequency of suicides and an increase in admissions for <b>depressions</b> in <b>spring</b> and fall. A corresponding rhythm for other forms of human behavior is described in the present thesis, indicating that the seasonal rhythm of psychiatric illness reflects a seasonal rhythm of behavior in greater parts of the population. The seasonal variation in behavior seems to increase with increasing latitude, to be more dramatic in the northern than in the southern parts of Norway. In this thesis results supporting a hypothesis of human behavior being influenced by changes in length of day are given. Changes in length of day may induce changes in sleep and other disturbances in the daily rhythm that could change mood and other emotional qualities in vulnerable individuals. The demands on our capability to adapt to changes in length of day are largest at the equinoxes...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship between somatic complaints and depression in a non-clinical adolescent population. Depressive symptoms and experiences were explored. Subjects were 434 ninth through twelfth graders from a Westchester School District. These students {{were part of a}} larger study of adolescent <b>depression</b> conducted in <b>Spring,</b> 1989. Somatic complaints were measured using the Achenback Youth Self Report (YSR) Somatic Complaint Scale. To provide greater dimensionality, groupings of selected somatic items from the broader study packet were also used. Depressive symptoms and behaviors were measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale for Children (CES-DC) and the Achenbach YSR Depressed Scale. Depressive experiences were measured using two scales of the Depressive Experiences Questionnaire (DEQ); the Dependency Scale, which has been theoretically linked to anaclitic depression and the Self-criticism Scale, which has been theoretically linked to introjective depression. There were two central theoretical hypotheses. The first was that subjects who have more somatic complaints are more depressed. The second was that anaclitic depression is characterized by more somatic complaints than introjective depression. Blatt (1974) has described anaclitic depression as primarily oral in nature and as characterized by feelings of dependence, helplessness, weakness and depletion. Introjective depression was described as at a higher developmental level and as characterized by self-criticism and feelings of worthlessness, guilt and a sense of having {{failed to live up to}} standards. Anaclitic depression has been theoretically linked to somatic complaints and the dependency scale has been positively correlated with somatic phenomena. Blatt does not view introjective depression as related to somatic complaints and the self-criticism scale has not been shown to be correlated with this variable. ^ Results of this study showed that all measures of depression, including the self-criticism scale of the DEQ, were significantly correlated with somatic complaints. When subjects were classified into nondepressed, moderately depressed and severely depressed groups using CES-DC cutoff scores, it was found that those subjects in the more depressed categories had significantly higher scores on somatic complaint items. When subjects were classified into nondepressed, anaclitic, introjective and mixed depression groups by applying a median split to the dependency and self-criticism DEQ scales, significant differences in somatic complaint scores were found. Post hoc analyses indicated that subjects in the anaclitic group had significantly higher somatic complaint scores than those in the introjective group. ^ A significant main effect for gender was obtained with higher scores for females on somatic complaint, depression and DEQ dependency measures. No gender x depressive category interactions were found, indicating that the effect of depressive category on amount of somatic complaints was similar for males and females. Theoretical and practical implications for the treatment, diagnosis and referral of depressed adolescents presenting with somatic complaints are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Life {{histories}} {{and distribution of}} mayflies (Insecta:Ephemeroptera) were investigated in 11 streams in south central Ontario that ranged from highly acidic to circumneutral. At least 29 mayfly species were recorded from the streams, with 16 common enough for life history analysis. Mayfly distribution and diversity were correlated with pH regime and stream size. No mayflies {{were found in the}} smallest, most acid stream, and numbers of mayfly species and their relative abundances generally increased with both increasing stream size and stream pH. Incorporation of life cycle information with distributional data enabled us to determine the precise stream-water pH range encountered by different mayfly life stages in the study streams. Generally, during the period of greatest acid stress in the streams (pH <b>depressions</b> associated with <b>spring</b> snowmelt) the mayflies were present in large or dormant stages, which are believed to be more tolerant of lowered pH.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} sub-harbour Waiwhetu Artesian Aquifer, and in {{particular}} the nature and characteristics of artesian leakage from submarine springs. This aquifer is a sheet of gravel and other coarse sediments which continues from the Lower Hutt Valley and extends beneath Wellington Harbour where it varies in thickness from approximately 70 m against the Wellington Fault scarp to just over 20 m thick against the eastern harbour margin. The water it contains is a valuable resource supplying approximately one third of Wellington's municipal water consumption. At present, there are plans to utilise this artesian water source to a greater extent in the future, to support a greater burden of the region's water requirements. However concerns over possible salt-water intrusion and contamination of the aquifer led to an interest in developing {{a better understanding of the}} characteristics of this artesian system, particularly beneath the harbour floor. Harbour floor depressions were selected as likely sources of artesian water leakage based on the presumption that they had been formed by the action of leaking artesian water from beneath. Eleven depression 'zones' were investigated by recording the salinity of the water within the depressions using a portable conductivity/temperature meter. SCUBA diver's observations and bathymetric mapping revealed that depressions ranged in width from 53 m to 369 m (at the harbour floor) and 12 m to 69 m (at the depression base), with depths ranging from 13. 3 m to 31. 3 m below sea level. Only a few depressions were found to be actively discharging significant amounts of artesian water. SCUBA diver investigations found this leakage to be typically concentrated at a number of small and discrete spring 'vents' located on the base of the active depression. Typical salinities recorded ranged from 28 - 33 ppt within a few centimetres of the discharge vents. Deployment of an S 4 current meter in two <b>depressions</b> showed that <b>spring</b> vent discharges vary with the pattern of abstraction from the pumping stations in the Lower Hutt Valley and as a consequence of the tidal cycle. High tides generate a greater load on the underlying aquifer, which in turn compresses the aquifer structure to a greater extent than at low tides, thus 'squeezing' out more water. Almost all of the recorded leakage was found to occur from a cluster of submarine springs within one of the depression zones, roughly 1100 metres from the Hutt River mouth. One other notable area of leakage was found close to Seaview Wharf. No significant leakage was observed or recorded from the two deep depressions south of Somes Island, which had previously been considered to be the major outlet of artesian leakage in the harbour. Lower than normal salinity values were also recorded in the harbour entrance. In this region the aquiclude is hypothesised to peter out, allowing artesian water to escape from the aquifer through a large area of the seabed in the form of widespread leakage as opposed to the concentrated, or discrete, form associated with spring vent discharge. Seismic profiles were used to map the extent of the sub-harbour Waiwhetu Artesian Aquifer and its upper confining aquiclude, the Petone Marine Beds. This work showed that the aquifer gravels extend across the entire harbour area. However, the water-bearing capacity of these deposits was found to be inconsistent. Preferential pathways, present as paleochannels (relic river channels), can be mapped within the aquifer. They concentrate the flow of groundwater through the aquifer and as such supply the submarine spring regions with much higher rates of water flow than the inter-paleochannel areas. The harbour floor depressions are thought to have formed as a consequence of the deformation of aquifer and aquiclude deposits during intense shaking associated with earthquakes leading to the removal of portions of the confining aquiclude. This typically occurs from a combination of raised piezometric pressures as a result of consolidation of the aquifer material during shaking, and from failure of the aquiclude by liquefaction. This rupture of the aquiclude results in the release of large volumes of artesian water through the aquiclude and to the sea. As this flow of water moves upward through the aquiclude, it erodes and transports away the fine sediment that forms this member. The features left behind are the characteristic harbour floor depressions we associate with submarine spring discharge. The abstraction of water from the Waiwhetu Artesian Aquifer (for the Wellington municipal water supply) lowers the piezometric pressure within the aquifer close to the abstraction zone. As such, the relocation of the abstraction focus (during 1980) to three kilometres inland from Petone Foreshore has greatly improved the 'health' of the subharbour aquifer and has similarly reduced the threat of salt-water intrusion. Data gathered during this study implies that while the two deep depressions south of Somes Island are unlikely to be a threat with regard to salt-water intrusion, the cluster of depressions off the Hutt River mouth could be a site of salt-water entry if piezometric pressures in the aquifer beneath them dropped low enough. Spring discharge velocities collected over one spring vent indicate that the presently set minimum piezometric Petone Foreshore level (below which abstraction must cease) needs to be revised...|$|R
