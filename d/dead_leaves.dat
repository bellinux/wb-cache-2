5|$|Mycena lanuginosa {{is known}} only from Kanagawa, in Honshu, Japan. Fruit bodies are found solitary or scattered, on <b>dead</b> <b>leaves</b> and twigs in lowland forests {{dominated}} by the oak species Quercus myrsinifolia and Q.serrata. Fruiting occurs from March to November.|$|E
5|$|Coccomyces dentatus is a {{saprobic}} species, {{and grows}} on <b>dead</b> <b>leaves</b> {{of a wide}} variety of angiosperms. It is frequently encountered on members of the heather (family Ericaceae), and the beech family (Fagaceae), such as oak (red, white, and live oak) and chestnut, and also on the exotic Castanea sativa from Chile. Other common substrates include leaves of trees in the genera Rhododendron, Lithocarpus, Berberis, Arbutus, Gaultheria, and Myrica.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{and birds}} {{associated}} with C.australis include lizards which forage among the flowers, including the gold-striped gecko which is well camouflaged for life among {{the leaves of}} the tree. New Zealand bellbirds like to nest under the <b>dead</b> <b>leaves</b> or among the flower stalks, and paradise shelducks commonly build their nests in the base of an old cabbage tree {{standing in the middle of}} a field. Red-crowned parakeets are often seen foraging in cabbage trees. In South Canterbury, long-tailed bats shelter during the day in the hollow branches, which would once have provided nesting holes for many birds.|$|E

2500|$|Others have {{suggested}} {{the practices of}} cannibalism (known also as anthrophagy), or excarnation, which is the practice of removing the flesh and organs of the <b>dead,</b> <b>leaving</b> only the bones. Romanian archaeologist Sergiu Haimovici writes about such a discovery: ...|$|R
5|$|Insects, {{including}} beetles, moths, wasps and flies, use the bark, {{leaves and}} flowers {{of the tree}} in various ways. Some feed or hide camouflaged in the skirt of <b>dead</b> <b>leaves,</b> a favourite dry place for weta to hide in winter. Many of the insect companions of C.australis have followed it into the domesticated surroundings of parks and home gardens. If the leaves are left to decay, the soil underneath cabbage trees becomes a black humus that supports a rich array of amphipods, earthworms and millipedes.|$|E
5|$|Lycoperdon echinatum can {{be found}} either solitary or in small groups. It {{typically}} grows {{on the ground in}} deciduous forests and grassy areas, glades and pastures, on moss, humus, or woody debris. The fungus has been noted to have a preference for beech woods. Fruit bodies may make their appearance anytime from the late spring to autumn. Older specimens {{are more likely to be}} overlooked, as their brown color blends into the surrounding environment of <b>dead</b> <b>leaves</b> and dead wood. The puffball is used by various species of scuttle flies (family Phoridae) as larval food.|$|E
5|$|There {{are nine}} species of insect only found on C.australis, {{of which the}} best known is Epiphryne verriculata, the cabbage tree moth, which is {{perfectly}} adapted to hide on a dead leaf. Its caterpillars eat large holes and wedges in the leaves. The moth lays its eggs {{at the base of}} the central spike of unopened leaves. The caterpillars eat holes in the surface of the leaves and leave characteristic notches in the leaf margins. They can infest young trees but seldom damage older trees, which lack the skirt of <b>dead</b> <b>leaves</b> where the parent moths like to hide.|$|E

5|$|Both {{the male}} and female are {{involved}} in the nest building. The male does most of the work, while the female perches on the shrub or tree where the nest is being built to watch for predators. The nest is built approximately three to ten feet above the ground. The outer part of the nest is composed of twigs, while the inner part is lined with grasses, <b>dead</b> <b>leaves,</b> moss, or artificial fibers. The eggs are a light blue or greenish color and speckled with dots. The female lays three to five eggs, and she incubates them for nearly two weeks. Once the eggs are hatched, both {{the male and}} female will feed the chicks.|$|E
5|$|The King Island emu was the {{smallest}} of all emus, and had darker plumage than the mainland emu. It was black and brown, and had naked blue skin on the neck, and its chicks were striped like those on the mainland. The subspecies was distinct from the likewise diminutive Kangaroo Island emu (D. n. baudinianus) {{in a number of}} osteological details, including size. The behaviour of the King Island emu probably did not differ much from that of the mainland emu. The birds gathered in flocks to forage and during breeding time. They fed on berries, grass and seaweed. They ran swiftly, and could defend themselves by kicking. The nest was shallow, and consisted of <b>dead</b> <b>leaves</b> and moss. Seven to nine eggs were laid, which were incubated by both parents.|$|E
5|$|The nectar of the ﬂowers {{is sought}} after by insects, bellbirds, tūī and stitchbirds. The leaves and the rough bark provide {{excellent}} homes for insects such as caterpillars and moths, small beetles, ﬂy larvae, weta, snails and slugs. Many {{of these are}} then eaten by birds such as saddlebacks and robins. The rough bark also provides opportunities for epiphytes to cling and grow, and lizards hide amongst the <b>dead</b> <b>leaves,</b> coming out to drink the nectar and to eat the insects. Good flowering seasons occur every few years only. While {{it is said that}} they foretell dry summers, it has been observed that they tend to follow dry seasons.|$|E
50|$|Louise Tiedemann {{died from}} a liver disease on March 24, 1895, {{at the age of}} fifty-seven.

25|$|Boki and {{his entourage}} were lost at sea and {{pronounced}} <b>dead,</b> <b>leaving</b> Liliha in administration as royal governor. On April 1, 1831 Kaahumanu heard rumors of a planned rebellion, so sent Hoapili to remove Liliha of her power, replacing her with Kaahumanu's own brother, John Adams Kuakini as governor of Oahu.|$|R
5|$|Wharanui grow to {{the west}} of the North Island's main divide. They have long, broad flaccid leaves, which may be an {{adaptation}} to persistent westerly winds. The wharanui type occurs in Wellington, Horowhenua and Whanganui, and extends with some modifications to the southern Taranaki coast. In Taranaki, cabbage trees generally have a compact canopy with broad straight leaves. In the South Island, wharanui is the most common form, but it is variable. The typical form grows, with little variation, from Cape Campbell to the northern Catlins, and from the eastern coast to the foothills of the Southern Alps. In Marlborough's Wairau Valley, cabbage trees tend to retain their old, <b>dead</b> <b>leaves,</b> lending them an untidy appearance. The climate there is an extreme one, with hot, dry summers and cold winters.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{three-quarters of}} all extant strepsirrhine species are nocturnal, {{sleeping}} in nests made from <b>dead</b> <b>leaves</b> or tree hollows during the day. All of the lorisoids from continental Africa and Asia are nocturnal, a circumstance that minimizes their {{competition with the}} simian primates of the region, which are diurnal. The lemurs of Madagascar, living {{in the absence of}} simians, are more variable in their activity cycles. The aye-aye, mouse lemurs, woolly lemurs, and sportive lemurs are nocturnal, while ring-tailed lemurs and most of their kin, sifakas, and indri are diurnal. Yet {{some or all of the}} brown lemurs (Eulemur) are cathemeral, which means that they may be active during the day or night, depending on factors such as temperature and predation. Many extant strepsirrhines are well adapted for nocturnal activity due to their relatively large eyes; large, movable ears; sensitive tactile hairs; strong sense of smell; and the tapetum lucidum behind the retina. Among the adapiforms, most are considered diurnal, with the exception of Pronycticebus and Godinotia from Middle Eocene Europe, both of which had large orbits that suggest nocturnality.|$|E
5|$|Caddisfly larvae can {{be found}} in all feeding guilds in {{freshwater}} habitats. Most early stage larvae and some late stage ones are collector-gatherers, picking up fragments of organic matter from the benthos. Other species are collector-filterers, sieving organic particles from the water using silken nets, or hairs on their legs. Some species are scrapers, feeding on the film of algae and other periphyton that grows on underwater objects in sunlight. Others are shredder-herbivores, chewing fragments off living plant material while others are shredder-detritivores, gnawing at rotting wood or chewing <b>dead</b> <b>leaves</b> that have been pre-processed by bacteria and fungi; most of the nutrients of the latter group come from consumption of the bacteria and fungi. The predatory species either actively hunt their prey, typically other insects, tiny crustaceans and worms, or lie in wait for unwary invertebrates to come too close. A few species feed opportunistically on dead animals or fish, and some Leptoceridae larvae feed on freshwater sponges.|$|E

PowerHouse ultimately won out and installed Octopus {{as one of his}} inner circle.|$|R
5|$|Cockroaches {{occupy a}} wide range of habitats. Many live in leaf litter, among the stems of matted vegetation, in rotting wood, in holes in stumps, in {{cavities}} under bark, under log piles and among debris. Some live in arid regions and have developed mechanisms to survive without access to water sources. Others are aquatic, living near the surface of water bodies, including bromeliad phytotelmata, and diving to forage for food. Most of these respire by piercing the water surface with the tip of the abdomen which acts as a snorkel, but some carry a bubble of air under their thoracic shield when they submerge. Others live in the forest canopy where they {{may be one of the}} main types of invertebrate present. Here they may hide during the day in crevices, among <b>dead</b> <b>leaves,</b> in bird and insect nests or among epiphytes, emerging at night to feed.|$|E
5|$|During extreme conditions, some frogs enter a {{state of}} torpor and remain {{inactive}} for months. In colder regions, many species of frog hibernate in winter. Those that live on land such as the American toad (Bufo americanus) dig a burrow and make a hibernaculum in which to lie dormant. Others, less proficient at digging, find a crevice or bury themselves in <b>dead</b> <b>leaves.</b> Aquatic species such as the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) normally sink {{to the bottom of}} the pond where they lie, semi-immersed in mud but still able to access the oxygen dissolved in the water. Their metabolism slows down and they live on their energy reserves. Some frogs can even survive being frozen. Ice crystals form under the skin and in the body cavity but the essential organs are protected from freezing by a high concentration of glucose. An apparently lifeless, frozen frog can resume respiration and the heart beat can restart when conditions warm up.|$|E
5|$|Péron {{stated that}} the nest was usually {{situated}} near water {{and on the ground}} under the shade of a bush. It was constructed of sticks and lined with <b>dead</b> <b>leaves</b> and moss; it was oval in shape and not very deep. He claimed that seven to nine eggs were laid always on 25 and 26 July, but the selective advantage of this breeding synchronisation is unknown. The female incubated the eggs, but the male apparently developed a brood patch, which indicates it contributed as well. The non-incubating parent also stayed by the nest, and the chicks left the nest two to three days after hatching. The eggs were preyed upon by snakes, rats, and quolls. Péron gave the incubation period as five or six weeks, but since the mainland emu incubates for 50 to 56 days, this may be too short. He stated a mother emu would defend its young from crows with its beak, but this is now known to be strictly male behaviour.|$|E
