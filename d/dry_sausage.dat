40|$|Actual healthy trends produce {{changes in}} the sensory {{characteristics}} of <b>dry</b> fermented <b>sausages</b> therefore, new strategies are needed to enhance their aroma. In particular, {{a reduction in the}} aroma characteristics was observed in reduced fat and salt <b>dry</b> <b>sausages.</b> In terms of aroma enhancing, generally coagulase-negative cocci were selected as the most important group from the endogenous microbiota in the production of flavour compounds. Among the volatile compounds analysed in <b>dry</b> <b>sausages,</b> ester compounds contribute to fruity aroma notes associated with high acceptance of traditional <b>dry</b> <b>sausages.</b> However, the origin of ester compounds in traditional <b>dry</b> <b>sausages</b> can be due to other microorganisms as lactic acid bacteria, yeast and moulds. Yeast contribution in <b>dry</b> fermented <b>sausages</b> was investigated with opposite results attributed to low yeast survival or low activity during processing. Generally, they affect sausage colour and flavour by their oxygen-scavenging and lipolytic activities in addition to, their ability to catabolize fermentation products such as lactate increasing the pH and contributing to less tangy and more aromatic sausages. Recently, the isolation and characterization of yeast from traditional <b>dry</b> fermented <b>sausages</b> made possible the selection of those with ability to produce aroma active compounds. Molecular methods were used for genetic typing of the isolated yeasts whereas their ability to produce aroma compounds was tested in different systems such as in culture media, in model systems and finally on <b>dry</b> fermented <b>sausages.</b> The results revealed that the appropriate selection of yeast strains with aroma potential may be used to improve the sensory characteristics of reformulated fermented sausages.

40|$|Traditional {{products}} {{are an interesting}} purchase option for the consumers confronted with the standardization of industrial products and the manufacture of these traditional products allows the producers to have more incomes in order to perpetuate their farm. The {{aim of this study}} is to identify and to characterise the diversity of traditional pure pork <b>dry</b> <b>sausages</b> of Massif Central, to know the perception of the consumers towards these products and to measure the impact of the sensory information on their perception. Firstly, the typology of manufacturing know-how on the overall traditional small scale facilities of Massif Central led to 6 groups of know-how which differed mainly by the choice of the raw materials used and by the techniques of drying. The link between the know-how and the organoleptic characteristics of the <b>dry</b> <b>sausages</b> was set up by canonical correlation analysis. Secondly, the organoleptic diversity of the <b>dry</b> <b>sausages</b> was characterised by sensory tools. The results confirmed that the factors driving the diversity are the raw materials used and the techniques of drying. The homogeneity and the regularity of the traditional <b>dry</b> <b>sausages</b> were demonstrated by the study of the composition of intra-dry sausage, of the batch of production and of the products through the year. These results allowed to check that the diversity observed on the small scale facilities is generally stable. Finally, the <b>dry</b> <b>sausages</b> representatives of the 6 know-how groups were presented to the consumers during an hedonic test in blind condition then with the information describing their sensory profile. The results showed that the traditional <b>dry</b> <b>sausages</b> are globally liked by the consumers. Moreover, the sensory information provided to the consumers oriented their preference. In fact, the sensory information allows the consumer to better analyse the organoleptic characteristics of the products. Thus, some producers with an innovative process offer to the consumers a larger diversity of traditional <b>dry</b> <b>sausages.</b> Contrary to the generally accepted idea, the traditional manufacturing is homogeneous and regular. Finally, these <b>dry</b> <b>sausages</b> have generally a good quality and are liked by the consumers of traditional products. L'objectif de cette étude est de caractériser la diversité des saucissons secs purs porc fermiers du Massif Central et de connaître la perception des consommateurs vis-à-vis de ces produits en présence ou non d'une information sensorielle. Premièrement, une typologie des savoir-faire de fabrication de l'ensemble des ateliers fermiers du Massif Central a conduit à 6 groupes de savoir-faire.
