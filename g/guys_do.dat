500|$|A scuffle {{broke out}} {{when a woman}} in {{handcuffs}} was escorted from {{the door of the}} bar to the waiting police wagon several times. She escaped repeatedly and fought with four of the police, swearing and shouting, for about ten minutes. Described as [...] "a typical New York butch" [...] and [...] "a dyke–stone butch", she had been hit on the head by an officer with a baton for, as one witness claimed, complaining that her handcuffs were too tight. Bystanders recalled that the woman, whose identity remains unknown (Stormé DeLarverie has been identified by some, including herself, as the woman, but accounts vary), sparked the crowd to fight when she looked at bystanders and shouted, [...] "Why don't you <b>guys</b> <b>do</b> something?" [...] After an officer picked her up and heaved her {{into the back of the}} wagon, the crowd became a mob and went [...] "berserk": [...] "It was at that moment that the scene became explosive." ...|$|E
500|$|Just Dance was {{developed}} by a small team of around 20 at Ubisoft Paris, and was only officially pitched six months prior to its eventual release. Poix explained that unlike the Raving Rabbids games, which he described as being a [...] "gamer's game", Just Dance was designed to contrast skill-based rhythm games with a concept and control scheme that would be accessible to a mainstream audience, encouraging them to [...] " [...] off the couch and [...] fun together". Ubisoft producer Florian Granger noted that Just Dance was designed to help players overcome their inhibitions and anxiety towards dance, helping them build a [...] "vocabulary" [...] of moves they can practice in a [...] "safe context", and with the game itself being {{the focal point of}} attention rather than themselves. He reminisced that [...] "everyone remembers going to a nightclub or school disco where it takes a couple of hours before anyone has the bottle to get up and dance. Most <b>guys</b> <b>do</b> the fix-placed-beer-bottle dance or neck-shake to the beat." ...|$|E

500|$|Terry Atkinson of Los Angeles Times {{viewed the}} album as {{offering}} [...] "an amazing variety of tones, moods, and topics and a consistently powerful level of expression". Although disliking [...] "Big Time", Atkinson concludes So is [...] "a great album, possibly Gabriel's best". Steve Hochman, also of Los Angeles Times, praised Gabriel's reinvention too, describing it as [...] "real progress" [...] {{compared to the}} contemporaneous work of other progressive rock acts such as Genesis, GTR and Marillion. Chicago Tribunes Lynn Van Matre praised the album's [...] "wave of funky rhythms" [...] and called for more appreciation of Gabriel's talent, but noted a lack of [...] "quirkiness" [...] and {{said there were no}} tracks as impactful as [...] "Biko", a single from his third eponymous album Peter Gabriel or [...] "Melt". Robert Christgau was also lukewarm in The Village Voice, writing that [...] "Gabriel's so smart he knows rhythm is what makes music go, which relieves him of humdrum melodic responsibilities but doesn't get him up on the one—smart <b>guys</b> <b>do</b> go for texture in a pinch." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a {{response}} to the controversy around the episode, Tony Fox, a spokesperson for Comedy Central, defended the episode, saying, [...] "The South Park <b>guys</b> <b>do</b> inappropriate things all the time...their goal is to make people laugh, not to offend people." [...] Additionally, another spokesperson for the network has said that [...] "South Park has offended people in the past and probably will again. Regular watchers would not be shocked." [...] Although rumors were spread about the episode not being broadcast in Australia due to the controversy, The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) announced the episode would be broadcast on SBS, but would be delayed 12 months due to programming issues.|$|E
2500|$|Speaking in January 2010 to noted UK soul writer Pete Lewis of {{the award-winning}} Blues & Soul, Fakir {{confirmed}} {{plans for the}} [...] "new" [...] Four Tops to release a new album, while revealing his personal feelings about the current line-up: [...] "To me the new group is like {{an extension of the}} family, because we've all been very close for so many years... Which makes it easier for ME, because I truly miss Lawrence, [...] "Obie" [...] AND Levi - I'd be lying if I said I didn't - and not one of them could EVER be replaced. But, you know, these new <b>guys</b> <b>do</b> perform well enough for the people to still enjoy the shows and still enjoy the music. So for me, it kinda makes it bittersweet. Because, {{at the end of the}} day, the legacy is still going on and I'm very pleased that it IS!" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Pip" [...] is a {{relatively}} unpopular episode of the series. According to creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, it is [...] "probably {{one of the least}} popular episodes of South Park" [...] they have ever produced, and that [...] "most people [...] pretty much hated it." [...] In 2004, Stone said that he considers the episode [...] "really cool" [...] and [...] "really good". In a 2011 Entertainment Weekly feature, the two named what they consider the best 15 episodes of South Park, along with the 53 worst. [...] "Pip" [...] was number 49 on the [...] "Worst" [...] list (following the first 48 spots which collectively consisted of every episode from the first three seasons). Parker said that [...] "Everyone, including us, hates 'Pip'", and Stone said [...] "I don't hate it. But it was like, 'Why did you <b>guys</b> <b>do</b> that?'" [...] The creators said that recreating Great Expectations in South Park style [...] "seemed like a decent enough idea, except that [...] kinda sucks", especially its ending. They have concluded that while they sometimes want to do an episode that is different in style and presentation to the other episodes, it is necessary to have it involve the regular characters, otherwise audiences will not like it.|$|E

2500|$|As Marla Heasley recounts in Bring Back... The A-Team (May 18, 2006), {{although}} sexism was not prevalent {{on the set}} per se, {{there was}} a sense that a female character was not necessary on the show. On her first day on set George Peppard took her aside and told her [...] "We don't want you on the show. None of the guys want you here. The only reason you're here is because the network and the producers want you. For some reason they think they need a girl." [...] The interview continues with Heasley noting that on her last day of work Peppard took her aside again, saying: [...] "I'm sorry that this is your last day, but remember what I said the very first day, that we didn't want a girl, has nothing to do with you. You were very professional, but no reason to have a girl." [...] In Bring Back... the A-Team, Dirk Benedict also remarked that: [...] "It was a guy's show. It was male driven. It was written by guys. It was directed by guys. It was acted by guys. It's about what <b>guys</b> <b>do.</b> We talked the way guys talked. We were the boss. We were the God. We smoked when we wanted. We shot guns when we wanted. We kissed the girls and made them cry... when we wanted. It was the last truly masculine show." ...|$|E
