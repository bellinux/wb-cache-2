25|$|The {{definition}} of phaser typically excludes such devices where the all-pass section is a delay line; such a device {{is called a}} <b>flanger.</b> Using a delay line creates an unlimited series of equally spaced notches and peaks. It is possible to cascade a delay line with another type of all-pass filter. This combines the unlimited number of notches from the <b>flanger</b> with the uneven spacing of the phaser.|$|E
25|$|For effects, Lifeson {{is known}} to use chorus, phase shifting, and flanging. Throughout his career, he has used {{well-known}} pedals such as the Electro-Harmonix Electric Mistress <b>flanger,</b> the BOSS CE-1 chorus, the Dunlop crybaby wah, among others.|$|E
25|$|Stoner doom, stoner {{metal or}} {{psychedelic}} doom describes doom metal that incorporates psychedelic elements, to varying degrees. Stoner doom is often bass-heavy and makes much use of guitar effects such as fuzz, phaser or <b>flanger.</b> Stoner doom {{could be viewed}} as the heavier and slower form of stoner rock, as the two styles emerged simultaneously. It was pioneered in the early–mid-1990s by bands such as Kyuss, Sleep, Cathedral, Acid King, Electric Wizard, Orange Goblin and Sons of Otis.|$|E
50|$|This EP employs mixing {{techniques}} such as backmasking, layering, <b>flangers,</b> noise and sudden time signature changes.|$|R
25|$|Creed uses a {{large number}} of effects on his voice and his guitar, {{including}} echoes, phase shifters, <b>flangers,</b> guitar synthesizers, fuzz, and octave dividers.|$|R
5000|$|By use {{of effects}} units such as <b>flangers,</b> phasers and chorus effects, that {{are able to}} {{modulate}} the pitch rather than just the volume.|$|R
25|$|In Lammy's storyline, {{starting}} stages 3 onward unlocks various sound morphers (<b>Flanger,</b> Harmonizer, Wah-Wah, Distortion, and Reverb) {{that can}} be selected with the Select button whilst playing as Lammy or Rammy. These morphers affect {{the sound of the}} guitar playing, while the Harmonizer can be further modified by using an analogue controller. The player may also use the back shoulder buttons (L2 and R2) to use the guitar's wammy bar. These modifiers are completely optional as they have no impact on points gained.|$|E
25|$|When Gallagher {{was with}} Taste, {{he used a}} single Vox AC30 with a Dallas Rangemaster treble booster plugged into the 'normal' input. Examples of this sound can be heard on the Taste albums, {{as well as the}} album Live in Europe. Brian May, of the band Queen, has {{admitted}} in interviews that as a young man, he was inspired to use a Vox AC30 and treble booster setup after meeting Gallagher and asking him how he got his sound. Gallagher also used Ibanez Tube Screamers, an MXR Dyna Comp, and various Boss effects, often using a <b>Flanger</b> and Octaver.|$|E
500|$|TISM's {{keyboard}} {{sound was}} provided by an Optigan which keyboardist Eugene Cester ran through a <b>flanger.</b> They mainly used standard tuning; however, Eb tuning and drop D were employed in some songs. Jock Cheese's bass was prominent in the songs {{to a degree that}} head of Festival Mushroom Records, Michael Parisi, described the sound as [...] "aggressive".|$|E
5000|$|Effects such as stereo chorus, phasers and <b>flangers,</b> which {{shift the}} pitch of the signal by a small and varying amount, {{creating}} swirling, shimmering and whooshing noises ...|$|R
50|$|The company offered {{traditional}} effects such {{as simple}} phase shifters, <b>flangers,</b> and foot-operated wah pedals as well. With George Merriman, former partner of guitarist and guitar and effect builder Dan Armstrong, Mutronics built the Octave Divider, and later made the Armstrong plug-in effects.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s, {{advances}} in solid-state electronics made flanging possible using integrated circuit technology. Solid-state flanging devices {{fall into two}} categories: analog and digital. The flanging effect in most newer digital <b>flangers</b> relies on DSP technology. Flanging can also be accomplished using computer software.|$|R
500|$|The spacey, electronic-sounding {{effect in}} [...] "Starship Trooper" [...] was {{achieved}} by running the guitar backing track through a <b>flanger.</b> Anderson wrote {{the bulk of the}} song, while Squire wrote the [...] "Disillusion" [...] section in the middle. The closing section, [...] "Würm" [...] is a continuous cadenza of chords (G-E-C) played ad lib. It evolved from a song called [...] "Nether Street" [...] by Howe's earlier group, Bodast.|$|E
500|$|The Stage's Effects Section expands on the Electro's effects selection. Included are the Electro's {{modulation}} effects (tremolo, auto-pan, ring modulation, auto-wah, and 2 manual wah algorithms), [...] "stomp box" [...] effects (2 algorithms each of phaser (effect), <b>flanger</b> and chorus). The Stage adds a delay module, amplifier modeling (Wurlitzer speaker, Fender Twin Reverb and Roland Jazz Chorus), overdrive, and {{expands the}} Electro's 2-band EQ to 3-band. Piano, Organ, and Synth sections can be independently routed through these groups. Two Master Effects are included – a simple compressor, and a 5 algorithm reverb.|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} was {{engineered by}} Jim Caruana and mixed by Jason Goldstein at Sony Music Studios in New York City. Goldstein was [...] hired to mix B'Day. He said: [...] "This song was really simple to mix. It {{was produced by}} Stargate and the sounds are really good and they all made sense, and {{there was lots of}} room for all the instruments." [...] Goldstein used a board equalizer for the drums' treatment. For the acoustic guitars, he used the analogue <b>flanger</b> of a TC 1210 spatial expander [...] "to sweeten the sound" [...] and to give them [...] "a little bit more spread". Goldstein thought [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] sounded [...] "a bit old-school"; an eighth note delay echo was placed on the song's lead vocal at 341ms, using the Echo Farm plug-in software. For the backing vocals, Goldstein used Echo Farm with a quarter note delay at 682ms and Sony's Oxford Dynamics compressor/limiter in dual-mono mode.|$|E
5000|$|A {{detailed}} gear {{diagram of}} Dean Garcia's 2002 Curve bass rig was documented by guitargeek.com, [...] In 2010, {{he said he}} used Eventide Ultra-Harmonizer, Akai 1100 samplers, Morley Wah pedal, many delay units and Boss pedals, a Zoom box, <b>Flangers,</b> EQs and a DigiTech.|$|R
5000|$|... “... {{the huge}} irony with the bands called ‚Shoegazing‘ {{was that a}} lot of those bands really were into the Cocteau Twins. And they all used choruses, <b>flangers</b> and other effects pedals to create a certain kind of sound.”- Kevin Shields, My Bloody Valentine ...|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} year saw {{the arrival of}} Univox's phase shifter and chorus effect. These pedals became favorite effects of guitarists like Jimi Hendrix and Robin Trower. By the mid-1970s a variety of solid-state effects pedals including <b>flangers,</b> chorus pedals, ring modulators and phase shifters were available.|$|R
500|$|Other {{themes were}} more general. [...] "Lady Killer" [...] {{has been cited}} as having a {{considerable}} thrash metal influence, and its topic of revenge against a serial killer is comparable to songs such as Iron Maiden's [...] "Murders in the Rue Morgue" [...] and Judas Priest's [...] "The Ripper". The song emerged when the band attempted to [...] "write a theme song for Jack the Ripper," [...] according to Heppner, and its distinctive intro was created by generating feedback on a 1976 Gibson SG run through a 1970s MXR rack <b>flanger.</b> [...] "The Gem" [...] portrays the apocalypse as being {{a good thing because}} it wipes humanity off the planet; whoever sets it in motion (Heppner explained as by [...] "open Pandora's Box") is hailed as a hero for having done the right thing. [...] "Communicating Via-Eyes" [...] is [...] "the werewolf song", as Heppner put it; he wrote much of that song while on tour with Megadeth in the UK. He later stated a song loosely inspired by An American Werewolf in London was written for the album, {{but it is not clear}} whether he was referring to a song already on the album or an outtake from it.|$|E
500|$|... "A Forest" [...] is {{performed}} in the key of A minor. Initially only the synth, guitar and drums are heard, followed {{by the introduction of}} the bass guitar and a second guitar part. The song initially follows an Am–C–F–Dm progression. Later on the track, its bridge contains a B–C–F#m–C–B–C sequence, which ends with a chromatic movement to the F chord before returning to Am. Following the echoing repetition of the word [...] "again", a guitar solo appears which avoids string bends and moving in a pentatonic manner. The single version of the song fades out at around four minutes, while on the longer (album) version the instruments exit one by one, concluding with the sound of the bass guitar at 4.46". The sound of Smith's guitar was a departure from that prevalent in the 1970s. Mike Hedges favored the use of flanging at the time, and he estimated that there were seven <b>flanger</b> devices used on [...] "A Forest". Rikki Rooksby said that the slow phase effect heard on the guitar in [...] "A Forest" [...] "almost became a Smith trademark for a while". Simon Gallup said that his playing on the track was intended to be reminiscent of the bass work in the music of The Stranglers, whose bassist Jean-Jacques Burnel was a major influence on him.|$|E
500|$|Loveless {{was largely}} {{recorded}} in mono sound, as Shields felt it {{important that the}} album's sound consisted of [...] "the guitar smack bang {{in the middle and}} no chorus, no modulation effect". Shields wavers his guitar's tremolo bar as he strums, which contributes, in part, to the band's distinctive sound. This technique—nicknamed [...] "Glide guitar"—causes the guitar strings to bend slightly in and out of tune. Shields said that due to his use of the tremolo bar, [...] "People were thinking it's hundreds of guitars, when it's actually got less guitar tracks than most people's demo tapes have." [...] The guitarist asserted that unlike other bands of the shoegazing movement of the early 1990s, My Bloody Valentine did not use chorus or <b>flanger</b> pedals. He insisted, [...] "No other band played that guitar like me [...] We did everything solely with the tremolo arm". Shields aimed to use [...] "very simple minimal effects" [...] which often were the result of involved studio work. He stated, [...] "The songs are really simply structured. A lot of them are purposely like that. That way {{you can get away with}} a lot more when you mess around with the contents". In a 1992 Guitar World interview, Shields described how he achieved a sound akin to a wah-wah pedal on [...] "I Only Said" [...] by playing his guitar through an amplifier with a graphic equaliser preamp. After recording the track, he then bounced it to another track through a parametric equaliser while he adjusted the EQ levels manually. The interviewer asked if Shields could have achieved the same effect more easily by simply using a wah-wah pedal, to which the guitarist replied, [...] "In attitude toward sound, yes. But not in approach." ...|$|E
5000|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine at AllMusic gave Black Swans and Wormhole Wizards {{three stars}} out of five, calling it [...] "a mature work {{from one of}} the great rock guitarists" [...] and [...] "pure guitar prog, filled with {{compressed}} boogies, sci-fi synths, exotic flourishes, and all of Satch's phasers and <b>flangers</b> in full-tilt overdrive." ...|$|R
5000|$|The large {{chrome plated}} housing was used through the 1970s as the Morley line grew {{to include all}} kinds of effects, {{including}} distortion units, <b>flangers,</b> phasers, and some unique devices such as the PKW [...] "Pik-A-Wah" [...] pedal. Morley produced many multi-function pedals such as the PFV [...] "Phaser Volume", the ECV [...] "Echo Chorus Vibrato", the WVO [...] "Wah Volume", the CFL [...] "Chorus Flanger", and the PWF [...] "Power Wah Fuzz".|$|R
5000|$|The hectic sound editing is most {{prevalent}} in the instrumental facet of the album, where, as Conrad Tao of Sputnikmusic explained, [...] "layers build upon one another and drop out without warning, beats appear out of nowhere, and <b>flangers</b> are employed liberally." [...] PopMatters critic Richard Elliott noted a [...] "stutter of the past" [...] in the album's drum parts which {{was a symbol of}} the [...] "general battle between analog and digital, “real” and synthesized, that occupied so much of that era’s aesthetics." ...|$|R

2500|$|Portland Company built 32 {{more cars}} before World War I. [...] Wedge {{snowplow}} #402 and <b>flanger</b> #202 {{were built in}} 1905. [...] Boxcars #65-74 were built in 1906. Flatcars #106–115 were built in 1907 and #116–125 were built in 1912. [...] All except the snowplow were on the heavy 30-foot underframe.|$|E
2500|$|A {{specific}} type of phasing, flanging is a similar effect, in which the notches are linearly spaced. In a <b>flanger</b> effect, the notches are created by mixing the signal with a delayed version of itself. Flangers tend to sound more pronounced and natural, like the [...] "jet plane whoosh" [...] effect, whereas phasers tend to sound more subtle and otherworldly. For comparison of the two effects, check flanging.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning {{with his}} work on Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001), he began to {{approach}} different chorus pedals, <b>flangers</b> and delays. Musically, he experimented with heavier guitar riffs on Box Car Racer (2002), while making greater use of pedals and loops. Blink-182 broke up in 2005 and DeLonge altered his equipment setup for his work from Angels & Airwaves' We Don't Need to Whisper to the present. He began pairing Voxes [...] and Fender '65 Twin Reverbs. DeLonge now uses the Vox AC30 with very little distortion.|$|R
50|$|Effects. An {{integral}} {{component of}} Ensoniq synths, the TS' effects were first-class and well specified, at 24-bit and 32 kHz engine. The effects block was arranged in several fixed algorithms, which allowed {{up to three}} simultaneous effects at once, plus a dry signal path. The effects list was comprehensive, including reverbs, <b>flangers,</b> chorus, compressors, delays. While adequate at single patch level, the effects block had to be shared by all instruments when the sequencer was used, meaning that only selected sounds could ported their effects to the mix.|$|R
50|$|In 1995, Belly {{released}} a second album, King, which progressed the avant folk-rock influences, power-pop jangle guitar sounds, and vocal harmonies {{of the first}} album into a direction driven more by vocals and driving rhythms, varying the pace within the songs to create tension. <b>Flangers</b> and chorus effects were evident in the guitar sounds. This album, produced by Glyn Johns, did not match the commercial success of Star. The band broke up in 1996, with Greenwood soon joining L7 and Donelly marrying former Juliana Hatfield bassist Dean Fisher in September.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{advantage}} of re-amping {{is that it}} enables producers and band members to have more options for remixing and redoing a recording {{a long time after}} the original recording. If the original recording of a song with electric guitar is done in 1985, and the electric guitarist's sound was only recorded with a mic in front of her/his combo amp or speaker cabinet, the recording will lock in the specific type of distortion, reverb, <b>flanger</b> processing and other effects that were used, which might sound [...] "dated" [...] several decades later. A producer who is tasked with doing a remix of this song 30 years later cannot [...] "undo" [...] or remove the distortion, reverb, chorus or <b>flanger</b> effects, and so there are limited options for remixing the guitar sound. On the other hand, if the engineering and production team in 1985 had simultaneously tracked (recorded) a [...] "dry", DI out signal from the electric guitar's pickups, a producer remixing the song 30 years later could take the dry guitar signal and re-amp it through 2000s-era digital effects and speaker systems, giving a new sound to this 1985 track.|$|E
2500|$|Construction {{started with}} a Porter 14-ton 0-4-4 Forney {{locomotive}} originally built for the Sandy River Railroad in 1883. [...] During construction, Portland Company provided the railroad {{with a number of}} 10-ton capacity cars 28 feet long. [...] They were flat cars #1-20, box cars #21-25, caboose #26, lowside coal gondolas #27-30, and box cars #31-36. [...] The Portland Company also built a wedge snowplow, a <b>flanger,</b> and two 19-ton 0-4-4 Forney locomotives #2-3. [...] Jackson and Sharp built four passenger cars 40 feet long. [...] These were clerestory-roofed baggage-express-RPO #1, clerestory-roofed coaches #2-3, and arch-roofed coach #4 designated a smoking car.|$|E
2500|$|... phaser - {{another way}} of {{creating}} an unusual sound; the signal is split, a portion is filtered with an all-pass filter to produce a phase-shift, and then the unfiltered and filtered signals are mixed. The phaser effect was originally a simpler implementation of the <b>flanger</b> effect since delays were difficult to implement with analog equipment. [...] Phasers are often used to give a [...] "synthesized" [...] or electronic effect to natural sounds, such as human speech. [...] The voice of C-3PO from Star Wars was created by taking the actor's voice and treating it with a phaser.|$|E
5000|$|The {{sound is}} psychedelic, churning, {{hypnotic}} — {{not at all}} frenetic or purely electronic. Metallic klangs glide over a slowed-down afro-percussion track. A train noise over a beat is mixed continuously with a funky guitar riff {{and then with a}} synthesizer composition (Jean-Michel Jarre?). <b>Flangers</b> and equalizer effects are applied, not like the overexcited tantrums of a modern DJ, but rather methodically and with deep feeling, changing the texture of entire passages, as if we are gently passing from a radio show through a train tunnel back to a great concert hall. Daniel Wang ...|$|R
5000|$|Maxon {{continues}} to expand its product line. Although they produced digital delays and reverbs during the 1980s and '90s, they now concentrate mostly on [...] "hard-to-find elsewhere" [...] vintage type effects such as analog delays, analog choruses and <b>flangers,</b> and classic overdrive and distortion units. Most of the old Ibanez Nine Series is available in Maxon form these days, but the Maxon pedals now include true-bypass switching and circuitry equal to or in many cases superior to the Ibanez originals. The company prides itself on a reputation of quality over quantity.|$|R
50|$|There are countless {{software}} plugins for DAW software, {{each one}} coming {{with its own}} unique functionality, thus expanding the overall variety of sounds and manipulations that are possible. Some of the functions of these plugins include digital effects units which can modify a signal with distortion, resonators, equalizers, synthesizers, compressors, chorus, virtual amp, limiter, phaser, and <b>flangers.</b> Each have their own form of manipulating the soundwaves, tone, pitch, and speed of a simple sound and transform it into something different. To achieve an even more distinctive sound, multiple plugins {{can be used in}} layers, and further automated to manipulate the original sounds and mold it into a completely new sample.|$|R
