In order to simplify the work and hold its power steady, 32 locomotives were converted to oil-firing by the DB in 1958 and 91 by the DR in 1963. With oil firing, the viscous fuel oil, almost solid when cold, is liquefied by a jet of steam, atomised and then combusted.

50|$|Since the 1920s, the ever-growing {{dissemination}} of sealed bearings throughout the manufacturing industries {{has made the}} use of grease fittings less common. Sealed bearings are lubricated for life at the factory, and are sealed such that the lubricant is not lost or dirtied. Grease fittings are far from obsolete, however, and much new machinery is built with them every year (e.g., tractors, lawnmowers, industrial plant equipment, and still a few car and truck parts). As long as maintenance is even minimally attended to (via occasional lube jobs where new <b>grease</b> is <b>pumped</b> into the bearing), this type of bearing and lubrication setup is cost-effective, simple, and long-lasting.|$|R

40|$|The {{formation}} of ice on wings and other control surfaces of airplanes {{is one of}} the oldest and most vexing problems that aircraft engineers and scientists continue to face. While no easy, comprehensive answers exist, the staff at NASAs Icing Research Tunnel (IRT) at the Glenn Research Center in Cleveland has done pioneering work to make flight safer for experimental, commercial, and military customers. The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) initiated government research on aircraft icing in the 1930 s at its Langley facility in Virginia. Icing research shifted to the NACA's Cleveland facility in the 1940 s. Initially there was little focus on icing at either location, as these facilities were more concerned with aerodynamics and engine development. With several high-profile fatal crashes of air mail carriers, however, the NACA soon realized the need for a leading research facility devoted to icing prevention and removal. The IRT began operation in 1944 and, despite renovations and periodic attempts to shut it down, has continued to function productively for almost 60 years. In part because icing has proved so problematic over time, IRT researchers have been unusually open-minded in experimenting with a wide variety of substances, devices, and techniques. Early icing prevention experiments involved <b>grease,</b> <b>pumping</b> hot engine exhaust onto the wings, glycerin soap, mechanical and inflatable "boots," and even corn syrup. The IRT staff also looked abroad for ideas and later tried a German and Soviet technique of electromagnetism, to no avail. More recently, European polymer fluids have been more promising. The IRT even periodically had "amateur nights" in which a dentist's coating for children's teeth proved unequal to the demands of super-cooled water droplets blown at 100 miles per hour. Despite many research dead-ends, IRT researchers have achieved great success over the years. They have developed important computer models, such as the LEWICE software, and made significant contributions to prevent ice buildup on turbine-powered commercial aircraft, helicopters, and military planes...|$|R

At the same time, the B-29 bombers and the battleships continued their bombing raids. Because of the naval gunfire and aerial bombardment, the Japanese commander, General Kuribayashi, mistakenly sensed that the Americans were coming in for a main invasion and opened fire. The infantry landing crafts and the enemy Japanese forces began exchanging fire from their 20 mm, 40 mm and 4.5-inch rockets over the combat swimmers (both the Marines and UDT) in the water.|$|R
5000|$|Tallow or lard {{was used}} as a {{lubricant}} to ease the insertion of muzzle loaded bullets. [...] Elongated rifle bullets were designed to be cast with grooves encircling the bullet to provide a reservoir for lubricant. These lubricants softened the black powder fouling for easier removal and reduced the tendency of bullets to leave deposits of lead in the barrel as they were fired. The latter advantage continued to be significant with smokeless powder. Attempts to obtain satisfactory high-velocity performance with cast bullets have included experimentation with a variety of lubricant mixtures including such things as beeswax, carnuba wax, Japan wax, bayberry wax, paraffin, petroleum jelly, sperm oil, castor oil, stearyl alcohol, lauryl alcohol, graphite, molybdenum disulphide, mica, zinc oxide, Teflon, cup grease, lithium soap, water <b>pump</b> <b>grease,</b> and a variety of more modern lubricating materials.|$|R

The excavator GJW 111 was taken example in this article, the measures of the Automated lubricate System based on {{the control of the}} testing of working states was studied, that is, the automated pouring grease, the working state test and the alarm when wrong of the every lubricating point on the machine is accomplished together by the control sub-system,lubricating system and some correlated components. The principle and the function of the system was described. The work condition was analyzed, and at last it was about the plan of the software and the hardware of the system. At present, the <b>pumping</b> <b>grease</b> lubrication of engineering machine are mostly done by manual work, which have disadvantages of long shut down maintaining time and low laboring productivity. In addition, the manual grease pouring quantity is difficult to be nicely controlled; the lubrication statuses of the lubricating points are difficult to check; and the labor load is heave too.

40|$|South East Water Limited is a {{state-owned}} company providing {{water and sewerage services}} to 1. 3 million {{customers in the}} south east region of Melbourne. One of the key management issues for South East Water was the control of blockages and spills due to build-up of fats and grease in the sewer system. In 1995 it was estimated that approximately 30 % of sewer blockages were caused by fats and grease, and that 80 % of these fats came from commercial businesses (that is, restaurants, fast food outlets, etc.). In order to reduce sewer blockages, South East Water implemented a three phase Greasy Waste Program in late 1995. The first phase involved putting all commercial premises on Trade Waste Consents. Over 4, 100 such consents were issued. The second phase was to ensure all commercial customers had an appropriately sized grease interceptor. Over 1, 650 new grease interceptors were installed. The third and final phase was to ensure that all <b>grease</b> interceptors were <b>pumped</b> out regularly. South East Water developed and implemented its Wastelog system in consultation with the Victorian Waste Management Association to monitor and enforce pump-outs. By 2001, the Greasy Waste Program had contributed to a 50 % reduction in sewer blockages caused by fats...|$|R
