A further cause of {{distress}} to Theobald was what he saw as the ingratitude of Becket, who did not visit the ailing archbishop.|$|E
5|$|Warren Jeffs' prison {{life has}} been tumultuous. At Utah's Purgatory Correctional Facility, he {{suffered}} from infected ulcers on his knees, which resulted from praying days on end during solitary confinement. He attempted to commit suicide by hanging himself at one point.

5|$|Following the 1896 tour, the English {{authorities}} realised action <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken.</b> Jim Phillips, an Australian-born umpire who journeyed {{each year}} between his native country and England, travelled to Australia with an English touring team in 1897–98. During {{two of the}} matches he umpired, Phillips no-balled Ernie Jones for throwing. Upon returning to England for the 1898 season, Phillips also called C. B. Fry, a prominent amateur cricketer and all-round sportsman, for throwing. This was the second of three occasions in 1898 that Fry was no-balled. Other umpires, following Phillips' lead, no-balled Fry and Frank Hopkins. Two further bowlers, albeit not famous cricketers, were called for throwing in 1899.|$|E

During the 2007 European Under-21 Football Championship, he made four appearances, scoring one goal in a 4–0 victory against Israel U21 in a group stage match on 16 June 2007, and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> off during the match after a right ankle injury.|$|E
5|$|SR209 was {{designated}} in the 1964 state highway renumbering. Plans for an interchange between I-5, I-8, SR 209, and SR 109 date from 1965, although several concerns <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> into account, including {{the preservation of}} historical Old Town and keeping traffic through the area moving during construction. The goal was to begin construction in 1966, and complete the interchange in 1969. There were concerns about a $3 billion shortfall in funding during May 1966, which caused the San Diego Chamber of Commerce Highway Committee to recommend the completion of SR 109 as a project.|$|E
5|$|Szigetvár {{was divided}} into three {{sections}} divided by water: the old town, the new town and the castle—each of which {{was linked to the}} next by bridges and to the land by causeways. Although it was not built on particularly high ground the inner castle, which occupied much of the area of today's castle, was not directly accessible to the attackers. This was because two other baileys <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> and secured before a final assault on the inner castle could be launched.|$|E

5|$|The {{matter of}} {{cooperation}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> {{up at the}} highest level. In September 1943, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, and President Roosevelt negotiated the Quebec Agreement, which reinstated cooperation between Britain, the United States and Canada. Chadwick, Oliphant, Peierls and Simon were summoned to the United States by the director of Tube Alloys, Sir Wallace Akers, {{to work with the}} Manhattan Project. The Quebec Agreement established a new Combined Policy Committee to direct the joint project. The Americans disliked Akers, so Chadwick was appointed technical advisor to the Combined Policy Committee, {{and the head of the}} British Mission.|$|E
5|$|The road {{over the}} pass was barely capable of {{handling}} the massive amounts of silver ore coming out of Aspen's mines. At first they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to Leadville by mule train to be smelted. Plants {{were built in the}} city soon afterwards, but it was still difficult and expensive to transport the silver obtained. The market was growing {{in the wake of the}} Sherman Silver Purchase Act, which required the U.S. government to buy the metal on a regular basis.|$|E
5|$|A {{long and}} winding route <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to reach topside; the steerage-class accommodation, located on C through G decks, {{was at the}} extreme ends of the decks, {{and so was the}} {{farthest}} away from the lifeboats. By contrast, the first-class accommodation was located on the upper decks and so was nearest. Proximity to the lifeboats thus became a key factor in determining who got into them. To add to the difficulty, many of the steerage passengers did not understand or speak English. It was perhaps no coincidence that English-speaking Irish immigrants were disproportionately represented among the steerage passengers who survived. Many of those who did survive owed their lives to third-class steward John Edward Hart, who organised three trips into the ship's interior to escort groups of third-class passengers up to the boat deck. Others made their way through open barriers or climbed emergency ladders.|$|E

5|$|At the Canning Dam {{and indeed}} all dams, care <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to prevent water seepage between the {{foundation}} rock {{and the structure}} of the dam. At the Canning in addition to cutting back the foundation to solid unfractured rock, a cut-off trench was sited near the upstream face of the dam, down stream which a rock filled drain containing open jointed pipes was provided to intercept any seepage between the rock face and the concrete of the dam. The inclusion of an internal drainage system was considered innovative at the period. Near vertical tubular 8 in (200mm) cut-off drains were provided at five-foot (1.52 m) intervals along the dam to relieve internal seepage through the concrete.|$|E
5|$|Baalham {{arrived on}} October 3, {{following}} a fruitless three-day search for survivors. The text of Geib's brief {{letter to the}} American consul appeared in that day's edition of the St John's Newfoundlander, while its rival newspaper The Public Ledger printed a more detailed account of the disaster provided by Baalham. Because St John's lacked a telegraph service, these reports <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> by the steamer Merlin to Halifax, Nova Scotia, {{where they could be}} wired to New York. Most of the Arctic party traveled on the same steamer; Geib remained in St John's, on the chance that further survivors might arrive. Merlin detoured to cover the area of the sinking, but discovered nothing; she then proceeded to Sydney, Nova Scotia and reached Halifax on October 11.|$|E

His {{photographs of}} the Taku Forts represent this approach on a reduced scale, forming a narrative recreation of the battle. The sequence of images shows the approach to the forts, the effects of bombardments on the exterior walls and fortifications, and finally the devastation within the forts, including the bodies of dead Chinese soldiers. The photographs were not taken in this order, as the photographs of dead Chinese <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> first—before the bodies were removed; only then was Beato free to take the other views of the exterior and interior of the forts.|$|E

Regular tickets went on sale on July 19. Pre-sale tickets <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> down early, as they were selling at such a fast rate that the tour was almost sold before regular tickets were available. Grande also was the opening act {{for the last three}} US dates of Justin Bieber's Believe Tour.

It was at these Listening Sessions that Grande discovered the album reached number one on US iTunes.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to similar measures passed in Milwaukee and Chicago, the Minneapolis Fair Employment ordinance gave the city's newly created Fair Employment Practices Commission (FEPC) authority {{to not only}} impose fines, but also prison sentences for employers who enacted job discrimination. Larger banks and department stores saw the value in civil rights and began to hire more African-Americans. Humphrey also recognized that city police officers operating under racial and ethnic prejudice were causing urban unrest, so he instructed the city's police chief to have officers in minority neighborhoods keep in contact with clergy, teachers, business owners, and other neighborhood leaders. This helped to redefine the issue of prejudice and got its attention as a problem that could be solved, not just {{a fact of life}} that <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> for granted.|$|E
5|$|The Eisenhower–Johnson Memorial Tunnel {{was known}} as the Straight Creek Tunnel during construction, named for the {{waterway}} that runs along the western approach to the tunnel. Before the tunnel was dedicated, it was renamed to honor Dwight D. Eisenhower and Edwin C. Johnson. Construction on the first bore of the tunnel was started on March 15, 1968. Construction efforts suffered many setbacks and the project went well over time and budget. One of the biggest setbacks was the discovery of fault lines {{in the path of the}} tunnel that were not discovered during the pilot bores. These faults began to slip during construction and emergency measures <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taken</b> to protect the tunnels and workers from cave-ins and collapses. Despite the best efforts of engineers, three workers were killed boring the first tube, and four in boring the second.|$|E
