500|$|The {{next morning}} saw {{the arrival of}} the {{follow-up}} force, six LSTs, each towing an LCM, escorted by the destroyers [...] and [...] and [...] and destroyer minesweepers [...] and [...] The LSTs entered Hyane Harbour and beached, coming under mortar fire as they did so. , manned by a United States Coast Guard crew, replied with 3 in (76mm) and Bofors 40 mm guns. The LSTs were unloaded over the next seven hours. In the process, ammunition, construction equipment, and stores piled up. To accommodate a proper dispersal of stores, General Chase ordered an attack to expand the perimeter. An air strike was requested. B-25s of the 345th U.S. Bomb Group were intercepted by an estimated fifteen Japanese fighters. These were driven off by eight escorting P-47 Thunderbolt fighters, which claimed eight Japanese aircraft shot down. Two B-17s of the 69thU.S. Troop Carrier Squadron on a supply dropping run were also attacked, and claimed to have shot one of their attackers down. Two of the four B-25 squadrons dropped bombs in areas occupied by American troops, two of whom were killed and four wounded before the 12th U.S. Air Liaison Party could correct the error. Both squadrons of the 5th Cavalry attacked at 15:00. All objectives were taken and a new, larger defensive perimeter was prepared. The 40th Naval Construction Battalion had landed expecting to work on Momote airstrip. Instead, they were ordered to use their equipment to clear fields of fire and construct fortifications, and were given a section of the perimeter to defend. Six trenches were dug out by a bulldozer and ten men stationed in each. Their <b>ditch</b> <b>digger</b> scooped out a [...] trench which formed a secondary line of defence. The airstrip's revetments were transformed into heavy machine gun posts.|$|E

Unlike the missions, the pobladores paid Indians for their labor. In exchange for their work as farm workers, vaqueros, <b>ditch</b> <b>diggers,</b> water haulers, and domestic help; they were paid in clothing and other goods as well as cash and alcohol. The pobladores bartered with them for prized sea-otter and seal pelts, sieves, trays, baskets, mats, and other woven goods.

According to the records of Political Commentator by the Eastern Han dynasty writer Cui Shi, the Louche consisted of three feet and thus was called three-legged Lou. The three legs had three <b>ditch</b> <b>diggers</b> under it used for sowing. The Louche was animal powered and was pulled by an ox and the leg of the Louche directly dug a ditch in the flattened soil, sowed the seeds, covered the seeds, and pressed the land flat at the same time. The machine was known for its utility and efficiency for serving several agricultural uses at the same time, while saving time and effort.|$|R

The English had built castles {{in the wake of}} the 1272 conflict, usually larger and more expensive than those of the local Welsh rulers, but the new fortifications were on a still grander scale. Carpenters, <b>ditch</b> <b>diggers</b> and stonemasons were gathered by local sheriffs from across England and mustered at Chester and Bristol, before being sent on to North Wales in the spring, returning home each winter. The number of workers involved was so great that it placed a significant strain on England's national labour force. The costs were huge: Caernarfon's castle and walls cost £15,500, Conwy's castle and walls came to around £15,000 and Harlech Castle cost £8,190 to construct.|$|R

50|$|After World War II they resumed making diesel engines, {{but with}} a {{completely}} new design this time with direct injection and toroidal cavity pistons. The 6.9 litre 4-cylinder unit gave 85 bhp at 1800rpm, and the 10.35 litre 6-cylinder unit developed 150 bhp at 1800rpm. These were aimed at both vehicle, marine, and stationary markets, {{and there was a}} horizontal version of the 6-cylinder unit for flat underfloor mounting. The same two engines were rated at 60 and 90 bhp for continuous marine use at 1600rpm, and a larger engine of similar design rated at 130 bhp and of 15.5 litres capacity was also listed. One of the unusual features of these engies is the ability to swap the utilities from side to side and from end to end, which also allows for making handed-engines for twin-engined marine craft. For marine use helical reduction gears of different ratios, and epicyclic reversing gears were also available. Many engines were supplied to their neighbour in Fallings Park, Guy Motors for use in their buses and trucks. A small number of diesel engines was supplied for British Rail Railbuses in 1958. They also powered the Fowler Challenger crawler tractors, the 6DC-630 in the Mk III, and the 6DJ-970 in the Mk IV. Meadows adverts show they were also used in plant like rock-crushers, <b>ditch</b> <b>diggers,</b> compressors and other equipment used in road building. They were also used to power military FV2502 27.5kVA generator sets.|$|R
5000|$|DJ Duncan Hines {{wanted to}} rap {{more on the}} group's songs but Motsi objected to this idea, Thinking that Hines should focus more on being a DJ instead of a rapper which would cause a rift in the group. Then, MC Hammer began showing {{interest}} in the group and wanted to sign them to his record label Bust It Records. However, group leader Motsi Ski turned down the offer citing a disapproval of Hammer's plans for the group which would have involved a name change and a toning down of the group's lyrical content [...] however, this didn't stop DJ Hines and MC Lee from accepting the offer and the two would leave Detroit's Most Wanted to form <b>Ditch</b> <b>Diggers</b> on Hammer's label, Leaving Motsi as the only remaining member left in the group. On March 29, 1993, DMW would release its third album and its final one as a group, Many Faces Of Death, Vol. III. The album was not as successful as the previous two albums as it did not chart {{on any of the}} Billboard charts but the album still sold pretty well locally in the city of Detroit. It would also be the final DMW album to be released through Ichiban Records. Now a solo project, Motsi would use the DMW name for the fourth album which was called Bow The F--- Down. It would be released on May 16, 1994. In the album, Motsi would diss his former partners DJ Duncan Hines and MC Lee in a remix to Legalize It as retaliation for them leaving taunting messages on his answering machine [...] and would also make fun of them in the album's liner notes by saying: Special shout out to them hoe niggas for going bootie i got tired of carrying yall hoes anyway bitch ass niggas. Despite this, the three always respected each other and still managed to keep in contact with each other after the break-up of the group. On November 15, 1994 a compilation entitled Early Days was released and it featured songs from DMW's first two albums. The final DMW album, Entitled Ghetto Drama, was released on January 9, 1996. Throughout the mid-90's, Motsi would begin experiencing legal troubles as he would find himself being incarcerated on separate occasions for Marijuana possession, Violating Probation, and carrying a firearm as a convicted felon. The DMW name was officially retired after Ghetto Drama and Motsi would re-surface with his own name as a solo artist in the 2000s.|$|R
40|$|The agronomic {{measures}} made obligatory by the cross-compliance Standard Temporary {{measures for}} runoff water control on sloping land {{included in the}} Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies (MiPAAF) decree on cross compliance until 2008, and by Standard 1. 1 Creation of temporary ditches {{for the prevention of}} soil erosion in the 2009 decree, certainly appear to be useful for the control of soil erosion and runoff. The efficacy of temporary drainage ditches and of grass strips in controlling runoff and erosion has been demonstrated in trials conducted in field test plots in Italy. When level temporary drainage ditches are correctly built, namely with an inclination of not more than 2. 5 % in relation to the maximum hillslope gradient, they allow the suspended sediment eroded upstream to settle in the ditches, retaining the material carried away on the slope and, as a result, reducing the quantity of sediment delivered to the hydrographic network. In particular, among all the results, the erosion and runoff data in a trial conducted in Guiglia (Modena) showed that in corn plots, temporary drainage ditches reduced soil erosion by 94 %, from 14. 4 Mg ha- 1 year- 1 (above the limit established by the NRCS-USDA of 11. 2 Mg ha- 1 year- 1) to 0. 8 Mg ha- 1 year- 1 (within the NRCS limit and also within the more restrictive limit established by the OECD of 6. 0 Mg ha- 1 year- 1). With respect to the grass buffer strips the most significant research was carried out in Volterra. This research demonstrated their efficacy in reducing erosion from 8. 15 Mg ha- 1 to 1. 6 Mg ha- 1, which is approximately 5 times less than the erosion observed on bare soil. The effectiveness of temporary drainage ditches was also assessed through the application of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) erosion model to 60 areas {{under the control of the}} Agency for Agricultural Payments (AGEA) in 2009, comparing the risk of erosion in these sample areas by simulating the presence and absence of drainage ditches at a distance of 80 metres from each other as required by the Standard. The results of the scenario analysis showed that the presence of ditches on average decreases erosion by 67 %. To sum up, the Standard was found to be effective from a hydraulic point of view, as the results have demonstrated the adequacy of temporary ditches for the control of runoff water. Another important result of this study was the production of a simple equation that can be directly used by farmers or, more realistically, by the farm advisory system to provide farmers with the information necessary for the realisation of temporary drainage ditches (depth and section that can be obtained with the most widespread types of <b>ditch</b> <b>diggers)</b> so that these ditches are effective and maintain their hydraulic efficacy throughout the entire cropping period. This equation would also be useful for cross-compliance control by the AGEA and regional control bodies...|$|R
