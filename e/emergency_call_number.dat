5000|$|Agentti 000 ja kuolema kurvit (English title Agent 000 and The Deadly Curves) was a 1983 Finnish spy comedy film {{directed}} by Visa Mäkinen and written by Ismo Sajakorpi. The film stars Ilmari Saarelainen as James Bond impersonator Joonas G. Breitenfeldt (Agent 000) and Tenho Saurén {{as a bank}} robber. English actor John Wood also makes an appearance as Agent 009, and his serious, wooden portrayal of the character stands {{in contrast to the}} outrageous antics of {{the other members of the}} cast contributing to further humour. Finnish actress Kielo Tommila stars as the reporter Ulla Salla and the main love interest of Agent 000.

" "Technical feasibility" in this context means that unlike in the United States, European regulators do not enforce the highest accuracy levels such as GPS for locating emergency cases. Although GPS allows a cell phone to be located accurately, European operators {{have the right to}} start out with the accuracy levels their mobile networks can provide right now. Because more than 80 % of European operators have implemented so-called Cell-ID technology [CI 03] for mobile positioning, only very low accuracy levels can be offered for now in emergency situations: 100 meters potentially in urban areas, but only up to 3 -kilometer accuracy in rural areas. A debate has started whether the latter is enough accuracy in the mid-term and ethically defendable by operators in case of life losse...|$|E
40|$|Aim. To analyze {{health care}} {{resource}} utilization and temporary disability in people of pre-retirement {{age in the}} Russian population. Material and methods. The analysis was carried out {{on the basis of}} the ESSE-RF study materials (13 regions of the RF). Standard epidemiological survey methods and evaluation criteria were used. The analysis included results of a survey of the ESSE-RF study participants about health care resource utilization and temporary disability (TD) during 12 months before the survey. The following characteristics were ascertained: a number and reasons of outpatient visits for medical assistance, hospital admissions (including duration of in-hospital treatment), emergency calls and temporary disability (a number of days and cases), their mean number per one study participant, mean number of cases and days of TD per 100 working participants, associations with social-demographic parameters, risk factors, chronic non-communicable diseases, stress and anxiety levels by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results. A total of 8334 people aged 50 - 64 years were examined: men – 2784 (33 %) and women – 5550 (67 %). A share of the hospitalized (at least one time) was 11 % in the age group of 50 - 54 years, 12 % – in the age group of 55 - 59 years and by the age of 60 - 64 this indicator increased to 15 %. 20 % of the participants at least one time were admitted to hospital and/or called an ambulance. A share of people who had utilized health care resources at least one time was increasing with age. Unemployed people were hospitalized more frequently than employed ones. Number of chronic non-communicable diseases correlated with the probability of hospitalization and/or emergency call. Categories 2 and 3 of disability, presence of diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease and hypertension were statistically significantly associated with the probability of hospitalization and/or emergency call. Smoking did not increase the probability of hospitalization and/or emergency call in comparison with absence of this risk factor, at that, people who had given up smoking were 1. 3 times more likely to be hospitalized than non-smokers. People with low and moderate alcohol consumption were hospitalized and called an ambulance significantly less often than those who abstained from alcohol. Clinically significant anxiety increased the probability of hospital admission and/or emergency call as compared to people without this factor by the HADS. Subclinical and clinically significant anxiety, mean and high levels of stress were associated with the probability of hospitalization and/or <b>emergency</b> <b>call.</b> <b>Number</b> of TD days turned out to be rather low - 0. 3 day per 1 working man and 0. 4 day - per 1 working woman, this index did not significantly differ with age. Conclusion. So, pre-retirement age (50 - 64 years) is characterized by increase in health care resource utilization due to health state worsening. At the same time significant share of people of this age (40 %) did not seek medical help. These 40 % of pre-retirement age people can be possible reserve for health state improvement by means of their active involvement in preventive activity of primary health care system (the study had been conducted before the preventive medical examination program starting).  </p...|$|E

40|$|This report {{considers}} {{the problems with}} positioning of <b>emergency</b> telephone <b>calls.</b> <b>Emergency</b> <b>calls</b> to the <b>emergency</b> <b>number</b> “ 112 ” answered by the emergency service in Sweden cannot always be positioned. That is, it cannot be decided where the call is coming from. The problem with positing of <b>emergency</b> <b>calls</b> is mainly caused by <b>emergency</b> <b>calls</b> coming from Internet Protocol (IP) telephones. Since the use of IP telephones are increasing the <b>number</b> of <b>emergency</b> <b>calls</b> coming from IP telephones will increase. For the emergency service to provide a secure and reliable service to the public {{it is crucial that}} all <b>emergency</b> <b>calls</b> can be positioned correctly. The report explains how <b>emergency</b> <b>calls</b> are connected towards the emergency service in Sweden, from the different types of telephones that support <b>emergency</b> <b>calls.</b> For the traditional fixed land line all <b>emergency</b> <b>calls</b> can be positioned, when using a mobile telephone 90 % of the <b>emergency</b> <b>calls</b> can be positioned. The IP telephones can be divided into two categories, fixed and nomadic. When a fixed IP telephone is used the <b>emergency</b> <b>call</b> can always be positioned correctly, the problem occurs when a nomadic IP telephone is used. Interviews have been held with the four largest IP telephone operators to get their views of the problem and whether they have an opinion on how to solve the problem. Practical tests have been performed to show the problem and when it occurs. To solve the problem with positioning of <b>emergency</b> <b>calls</b> coming from IP telephones an international standard must be set. New features needs to be implemented in the networks so that the calls coming from IP telephones can be positioned and utilize positioning features such as GPS. A lot of work still remains before an international standard can be set...|$|R
