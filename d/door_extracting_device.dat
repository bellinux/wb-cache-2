40|$|The {{presence}} of inhomogeneities in semiconductor materials used to fabricate solar cell devices {{may result in}} spatial non uniformities in the device properties which may affect current generation in these devices. Besides, current reducing defects such as inclusions, local shunts and optical blockages may be introduced during the various device manufacturing processes which may adversely affect the performance and overall efficiency of solar cells. Diagnostic techniques are therefore needed to identify these defects so as to improve the production technology. This thesis presents the Light Beam Induced Current (LBIC) technique for mapping spatial non uniformities in solar cell devices. The LBIC is a non destructive characterisation technique that uses a focused light beam to raster scan a solar cell surface as the photo-generated current is recorded {{as a function of}} position to generate a photo-response map. The technique was used to obtain photoresponse maps for a mc-Si, Back contact Back junction (BC-BJ) silicon solar cell and the InGaP/InGaAs/Ge concentrating triple junction (CTJ) solar cell from which various local current reducing defects were mapped. A reflection signal detector was incorporated into the LBIC measurement system to enable us distinguish between optical blockages on the cell surface and current reducing defects within the solar cell devices. By dynamically biasing the solar cell devices, the electrical activity of the identified defects was investigated and also point-by-point current-voltage (I-V) characteristics were obtained. An interval division algorithm was applied to the measured point-by-point I-V characteristics to <b>extract</b> <b>device</b> and performance parameters from which device and performance parameter uniformity of the devices were mapped. Dark and full cell solar illumination I-V characteristics were also measured to <b>extract</b> <b>device</b> parameters. Analysis of extracted parameters revealed differences between extracted dark and illuminated device parameters which was attributed to departure from the superposition principle due to non-linearity of the semiconductor device equations with respect to carrier concentration. An investigation into the effect of illumination intensity on the I-V parameters of a spot illuminated BC-BJ Si solar cell showed a linear increase and a logarithmic increase of the short circuit current and open circuit voltage respectively with intensity while the series resistance decreased with intensity, which was attributed to increase in conductivity of the active layer. The ideality factor and saturation current were observed to increase while the shunt resistance initially increased before decreasing at higher intensity levels. Under monochromatic illumination, the photo-response of the BC-BJ Si cell was higher at 785 nm than at 445 nm due to low absorption coefficient of Si for longer wavelength radiations, resulting in carrier generation within the bulk, where there is a higher probability of carriers being collected at the p-n junction before they recombine. Under solar illumination, as the spectral content was altered using long pass colour filters with cut off wavelengths of 610 nm and 1000 nm, the performance parameters were observed to decrease and this was mainly due to decrease in intensity. For the CTJ solar cell, however, blocking of radiations below 610 nm resulted in current mismatch that severely degraded the short circuit current (Isc). The current mismatch affected the <b>extracted</b> <b>device</b> and performance parameters. With a 1000 nm long pass filter, a dark I-V was obtained since only the bottom Ge subcell was activated...|$|R

Conversely, during uphill flows devices experience reduced thrust variation, as the velocity profile is more uniform due to the favourable pressure gradient.
