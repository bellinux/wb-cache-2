5|$|As intended, the Comanche {{was to be}} {{equipped}} with sophisticated avionics, including navigation and detection systems, which would have to enabled operations during nighttime and within challenging weather conditions. Its primary mission was to scout around using its advanced sensors, attempting to find and designate targets for attack helicopters, such as the AH-64 Apache, to strike. The Comanche was furnished with a digital <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> Each of the two crew members were to be provided {{with a pair of}} LCD multi-functional displays which would have functioned in addition to the Helmet-Integrated Display and Sight System (HIDSS) worn by the crew.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedSurvivability of military combat aircraft has received increased emphasis by the U. S. Armed Services in recent years. The primary {{objective of the}} U. S. Military Survivability Policy {{is to ensure that}} effective survivability enhancement features are incorporated in current and all future U. S. combat aircraft. Technology advances in <b>Fly-By-Wire</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Systems</b> have significantly enhanced the performance capabilities of modern fighter/attack aircraft. In consonance with the military services survivability policy. a series of survivability design guidelines for <b>Fly-By-Wire</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Systems</b> have been developed, and are herein presented. A recommendation for future survivability enhancement through the use of digital <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> technology, {{in a manner similar to}} artificial intelligence, is presented.

50|$|Having {{eliminated}} the mechanical transmission circuits in <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems,</b> {{the next step}} is to eliminate the bulky and heavy hydraulic circuits. The hydraulic circuit is replaced by an electrical power circuit. The power circuits power electrical or self-contained electrohydraulic actuators that are controlled by the digital <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> computers. All benefits of digital fly-by-wire are retained.|$|R
25|$|Embraer's {{timeline}} {{was delayed}} because software {{development for the}} <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> was running behind schedule. Supported by 800 engineers, the first Legacy 500 prototype (PT-ZEX) was rolled out on 23 December 2011 to begin ground testing and systems evaluation, prior to the aircraft’s first flight scheduled {{for the third quarter}} of 2012. The first engine run was completed on January 17, 2012.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} address the {{inherent}} flight instability of a flying wing aircraft, the B-2 uses a complex quadruplex computer-controlled <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> that can automatically manipulate flight surfaces and settings without direct pilot inputs {{in order to maintain}} aircraft stability. The flight computer receives information on external conditions such as the aircraft's current air speed and angle of attack via pitot-static sensing plates, as opposed to traditional pitot tubes which would negatively affect the aircraft's stealth capabilities. The flight actuation system incorporates both hydraulic and electrical servoactuated components, and it was designed {{with a high level of}} redundancy and fault-diagnostic capabilities.|$|E
25|$|Avionics {{include a}} triple-redundant digital <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> a head-up display system, and Full Authority Digital Engine Controls (FADEC). The cockpit has been {{designed}} so that the AW609 can be flown by a single pilot in instrument flight rules conditions. Several of the aircraft's controls, such as blade pitch, are designed to resemble and function like their counterparts on conventional rotorcraft, enabling helicopter pilots to transition to the type more easily. Elements of the aircraft's controls feature touchscreen interfaces. Shortly following AgustaWestland's full acquisition of the program, a substantial modernisation of the AW609's design was initiated in 2012; these changes included new engines and the redesigning of the cockpit. As part of the design refresh, new flight management systems, Northrop Grumman inertial and GPS navigation systems, and various other avionics from Rockwell Collins were adopted.|$|E
50|$|A newer <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> called {{intelligent}} <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> (IFCS), is {{an extension}} of modern digital <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems.</b> The aim is to intelligently compensate for aircraft damage and failure during flight, such as automatically using engine thrust and other avionics to compensate for severe failures such as loss of hydraulics, loss of rudder, loss of ailerons, loss of an engine, etc. Several demonstrations were made on a flight simulator where a Cessna-trained small-aircraft pilot successfully landed a heavily damaged full-size concept jet, without prior experience with large-body jet aircraft. This development is being spearheaded by NASA Dryden Flight Research Center. It is reported that enhancements are mostly software upgrades to existing fully computerized digital <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems.</b> The Dassault Falcon 7X and Embraer Legacy 500 business jets have flight computers that can partially compensate for engine-out scenarios by adjusting thrust levels and control inputs, but still require pilots to respond appropriately.|$|R
40|$|Highly {{reliable}} fault-tolerant {{computer systems}} are discussed {{for use in}} flight-critical avionic and <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> of future commercial transport aircraft. Such aircraft are envisioned to have integrated systems, to be terminally configured, and to be equipped with <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems,</b> all of which require highly reliable, fault-tolerant computers. Two candidate computer architectures are identified as having the potential of satisfying the commercial transport aircraft requirements...|$|R

500|$|On 26 June 1988, Air France Flight 296 {{crashed into}} {{trees at the}} end of runway at Mulhouse-Habsheim Airport, three out of 130 {{passengers}} were killed. In February 1990 another A320, Indian Airlines Flight 605, crash landed short of the airport runway in Bangalore, the ensuing fire contributed to the casualty count of ninety-two, out of 146 on board. The press and media later questioned the <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> but subsequent investigations by commission of inquiry found [...] "no malfunction of the aircraft or its equipment which could have contributed towards a reduction in safety or an increase in the crew's workload during the final flight phase... the response of the engines was normal and in compliance with certification requirement".|$|E
500|$|The project {{never went}} past the {{exploratory}} phase. It comprised two clean-sheet designs – the AE316 and the AE317. The AE316 {{would have had}} a length of , and the AE317, [...] The standard versions of both variants had a maximum take-off weight of [...] for the smaller version and [...] for the AE317, and would have been powered by either BMW Rolls-Royce, CFM International, or Pratt & Whitney turbofan engines. Range was settled at [...] for both standard variants, although there was a higher-gross weight version which had greater range and engine power. The AE316 and AE317 would have seated a maximum of 105 and 125 passengers in five-abreast seating, respectively. Both would share a flight deck and <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> {{similar to that of the}} A320 family.|$|E
500|$|Saab {{rolled out}} the first Gripen on 26 April 1987, marking its 50th anniversary. [...] Originally planned to fly in 1987, the first flight was delayed by 18 months due to issues with the flight control system. [...] On 9 December 1988, the first {{prototype}} (serial number 39-1) took its 51-minute maiden flight with pilot Stig Holmström at the controls. [...] During the test programme, concern surfaced about the aircraft's avionics, specifically the <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> (FCS), and the relaxed stability design. On 2 February 1989, this issue led to {{the crash of the}} prototype during an attempted landing at Linköping; the test pilot Lars Rådeström walked away with a broken elbow. [...] The cause of the crash was identified as pilot-induced oscillation, caused by problems with the FCS's pitch-control routine.|$|E
5|$|The first {{member of}} the A320 {{aircraft}} family was the A320, which first flew on 22 February 1987 after the program was launched in March 1984.

500|$|The {{aircraft}} was subsequently demonstrated at the Paris Air Show in 1997. The aircraft's {{arrival at the}} show was delayed by bureaucratic problems and the {{aircraft was}} only able to perform on {{last day of the}} show. However, the show's organisers recognised the Su-37 as the standout performer at the event. The aircraft thereafter participated in the MAKS air show in Moscow, the International Defence Exhibition in Dubai, and the FIDAE air show in Santiago, Chile, as authorities sought to export the aircraft. With the expiration of the engines' service lives, the aircraft later had the AL-37FUs replaced with standard production AL-31F engines that lacked movable nozzles. The loss of thrust vectoring was somewhat compensated for by an update to the <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> The aircraft's foreign avionics were also replaced with indigenous designs. It resumed test flights in October 2000.|$|E
500|$|Apart {{from the}} {{addition}} of thrust-vectoring nozzles, the Su-37 did not outwardly differ much from the canard-equipped Su-27M. Instead, engineers had focused on the aircraft's avionics. Unlike previous Su-27Ms, the Su-37 had a digital (as opposed to analogue) <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> which was directly linked to the thrust-vectoring control system. Together with the aircraft's overall high thrust-to-weight ratio and the engine's full authority digital engine control feature, the integrated propulsion and flight control systems rendered the aircraft extremely manoeuvrable at high angles of attack and low speeds. The aircraft's weapons-control system had also been improved, as it included the N011M Bars (literally [...] "Panther") pulse-Doppler phased-array radar that provided the aircraft with simultaneous air-to-air and air-to-ground capability. The radar was capable of tracking twenty aerial targets and directing missiles toward eight of them simultaneously; in comparison, the Su-27M's baseline N011 could only track fifteen aerial targets and engage six of them simultaneously. The aircraft retained from the Su-27M the N012 self-defence radar located in the rearward-projecting tail boom.|$|E
2500|$|According to Eine, the Lavi's {{main area}} of {{advancement}} over its contemporaries was {{the level of}} integration of avionics and onboard electronics; it was claimed that the Lavi was [...] "more computerised than any other system in the world". A key innovation {{was the use of}} a quadruplex-redundant digital <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> which was co-developed by Lear Siegler and IAI. If it had been brought into service, the Lavi may have become the first operational aircraft to employ fully digital flight controls.|$|E
2500|$|In 1981, USAF began forming {{requirements}} {{for a new}} air superiority fighter intended to replace the capability of the F-15 Eagle.

The F-15SA have a modern <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> {{in place of the}} hybrid electronic/mechanical system used by all {{previous}} F-15s. [...] The variant includes the APG-63(v)3 active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, digital electronic warfare systems (DEWS), infrared search and track (IRST) systems, and other advanced systems.

[...] The fly-by-wire system will allow the carriage of weapons on the previously unused outer wing weapon stations.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{aircraft}} require {{increased pressure}} on the rudder pedals {{to achieve the same}} amount of rudder control at a higher speed. The Airbus A300 and later Airbus A310 do not operate on a <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> but instead use conventional mechanical flight controls. The NTSB determined that [...] "because of its high sensitivity, the A300-600 rudder control system is susceptible to potentially hazardous rudder pedal inputs at higher speeds". The Allied Pilots Association, in its submission to the NTSB, argued that the unusual sensitivity of the rudder mechanism amounted to a design flaw which Airbus should have communicated to the airline. The main rationale for their position came from a 1997 report that referenced 10 incidents in which A300 tail fins had been stressed beyond their design limitation.|$|E
2500|$|The fighter {{plane is}} {{different}} from the MiG-29 flown by Indian Air Force. The aircraft has been modified for aircraft carrier operation by hardening the undercarriage. It also has much better 'over-the-nose' vision to make it easy to land aboard a carrier at a high angle of attack. Modifications made for Indian Navy requirement featured Zhuk-ME radar, RD-33MK engine, combat payload up to 5,500kg, 13 hardpoints (inclusive of the multi-lock bomb carriers), additional fuel tanks situated in dorsal spine fairing and wing LERXs, increased total fuel capacity by 50% comparing to first variant of MiG-29 and an updated 4-channel digital <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> With special coatings, the MiG-29K radar reflecting surface is 4–5 times smaller than of basic MiG-29. Cockpit displays consist of wide HUDs, 3 [...] colour LCD MFDs (7 on the MiG-29KUB), a French Sigma-95 satellite GPS module and Topsight E helmet-mounted targeting system compatible with the full range of weapons carried by the MiG-29M and MiG-29SMT.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, the top {{concern for}} computerized, digital, {{fly-by-wire}} systems is reliability, {{even more so}} than for analog electronic <b>control</b> <b>systems.</b> This is because the digital computers that are running software are often the only control path between the pilot and aircraft's <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> surfaces. If the computer software crashes for any reason, the pilot may be unable to control an aircraft. Hence virtually all <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> are either triply or quadruply redundant in their computers and electronics. These have three or four flight-control computers operating in parallel, and three or four separate data buses connecting them with each control surface.|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of highly reliable <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> {{makes it possible}} to consider a strong reliance on automatic <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> in the design optimization of future aircraft. This design philosophy has been referred to as the control configured vehicle approach or the application of active control technology. Several studies and flight tests sponsored by the Air Force and NASA have demonstrated the potential benefits of control configured vehicles and active control technology. The present status and trends of active control technology are reviewed and the impact it will have on aircraft designs, design techniques, and the designer is predicted...|$|R
50|$|Ohio University Avionics Engineering Center {{operates}} a controversial avionics test facility on Runway 9L, the north runway at Miami Executive Airport.

50|$|The {{trend of}} {{programmable}} electronic systems and datalinks {{is likely to}} continue with the possibility that ground based radar systems and processing systems will allow advanced training aircraft to function as if they truly had onboard radar systems, with the cockpit closely replicating {{the look and feel of}} an air forces more capable aircraft for maximum familiarity. Programmable engine management and <b>fly-by-wire</b> <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> will allow an aircraft to mimic the flight characteristics of frontline aircraft with actual performance being restricted to a pilot's level of ability, with more power and greater agility becoming available as a pilot's skill improves.|$|R
50|$|The Shuttle {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} craft to use a computerized <b>fly-by-wire</b> digital <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> This means no mechanical or hydraulic linkages connected the pilot's control stick to the control surfaces or reaction <b>control</b> <b>system</b> thrusters. The <b>control</b> algorithm, which used a classical Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) approach, was developed and maintained by Honeywell. The Shuttle's <b>fly-by-wire</b> digital <b>flight</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> was composed of 4 <b>control</b> <b>systems</b> each addressing a different mission phase: Ascent, Descent, On-Orbit and Aborts.
