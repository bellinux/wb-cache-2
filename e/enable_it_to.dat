5|$|The Australian Army is Australia's {{military}} land force. While the Australian Army is principally a light infantry force, it {{is currently}} being 'hardened and networked' and expanded to <b>enable</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> conduct higher-intensity operations.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the size}} of the Queen Elizabeth class would <b>enable</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> {{accommodate}} most current and projected carrier-based fixed-wing aircraft, the lack of arresting gear means that, as initially completed, it is only capable of operating either STOVL aircraft, such as the AV-8B Harrier or F-35B Lightning, tiltrotor aircraft such as the V-22 Osprey, or aircraft that do not require either catapult-assisted take-off or arrested recovery.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{these public}} functions, the {{pavilion}} is available, {{as is the}} entire park, as a venue for private events year-round. The stage's glass and steel doors <b>enable</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> provide indoor space protected from the elements when necessary. In addition, the pavilion has a Choral Rehearsal Room that can be rented.|$|E

5|$|The 'defects' of one organ are {{remedied}} by {{the structure}} of another. The elephant has, Paley argues, a short neck because its head is so heavy, but in compensation it has a long trunk, enabling it to reach out. Similarly the spider has no wings to <b>enable</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> chase its flying prey, but has a web, and organs adapted to produce it, which compensates for the lack.|$|E
5|$|The RNSB also {{operated}} the 118th Minesweeper Flotilla, composed of MMS-class minesweepers, from Harwich from 1943. The 118th {{served in the}} English Channel and North Sea clearing paths through German minefields. In November 1944, the flotilla was involved in clearing the Scheldt Estuary to the Belgian port of Antwerp to <b>enable</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> {{be used by the}} Allies.|$|E
5|$|The {{blackcurrant}} {{requires a}} number of essential nutrients to be present to <b>enable</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> thrive; nitrogen provides strong plant growth and stimulates the production of flower sprigs; phosphorus aids growth, the setting of fruit and crop yield; potassium promotes growth of individual shoots and increases the weight of individual fruits; magnesium is a constituent of chlorophyll and helps increase yields through interaction with potassium; calcium is required for cell division and enlargement and is particularly important for young plants and buds.|$|E

50|$|Several {{features}} {{shared with}} other basal cetaceans indicate the close affinities of Ambulocetus with these animals; {{it had an}} adaptation in the nose that <b>enabled</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> swallow underwater, and its periotic bone's structure was like those of whales, <b>enabling</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> hear well underwater. In addition, its teeth {{are similar to those}} of other early cetaceans.|$|R

5|$|The {{planners}} then examined {{whether a}} commando force was feasible {{to accomplish the}} task. An unusually high spring tide was due in March 1942 which would allow a light ship to pass over the sand banks in the estuary and approach the docks, bypassing the heavily defended dredged channel. The approach was too shallow for an infantry landing ship, but the planners believed if a destroyer could be lightened it might have a draft shallow enough to <b>enable</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> get through.|$|E
5|$|A {{range of}} {{applications}} were considered for Advanced Gemini missions, including military flights, space station crew and logistics delivery, and lunar flights. The Lunar proposals ranged from reusing the docking systems {{developed for the}} Agena target vehicle on more powerful upper stages such as the Centaur, which could propel the spacecraft to the Moon, to complete modifications of the Gemini to <b>enable</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> land on the Lunar surface. Its applications would have ranged from manned lunar flybys before Apollo was ready, to providing emergency shelters or rescue for stranded Apollo crews, or even replacing the Apollo program.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} marine animals possess active {{camouflage}} through {{their ability to}} change colour rapidly. Several bottom-living fish such as the flounder can hide themselves effectively against a variety of backgrounds. Many cephalopods including octopus, cuttlefish, and squid similarly use colour change, in their case both for camouflage and signalling. For example, the big blue octopus, Octopus cyanea, hunts during the day, and can match itself to the colours and textures of its surroundings, both to avoid predators and to <b>enable</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> approach prey. It can perfectly resemble a rock or a coral it is hiding beside. When necessary, in order to scare away a potential predator, it can display markings which resemble eyes.|$|E

In Eurosatory 2014, it was displayed with an Otokar designed, remotely controlled stabilized weapon station compromising of a 7.62mm/5.56mm machine gun designed for infantry fighting vehicles. Depending on configuration, it can carry up to 9 troops.|$|R
5000|$|A rolling ruler is a ruler that {{contains}} a cylinder much like a rolling pin inside, thereby <b>enabling</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> [...] "roll" [...] along {{a sheet of paper}} or other surface where it is being used. A rolling ruler can draw straight, parallel lines, and also has other instruments included, <b>enabling</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> do the jobs of a protractor and compass.|$|R

5|$|All banksias have {{developed}} proteoid or cluster roots {{in response to}} the nutrient poor conditions of Australian soils (particularly lacking in phosphorus). The plant develop masses of fine lateral roots that form a mat-like structure underneath the soil surface, and <b>enable</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> extract nutrients as efficiently possible out of the soil. A study of three co-occurring species in banksia woodland in southwestern Australia—Banksia menziesii, B. attenuata and B. ilicifolia—found that all three develop fresh roots in September after winter rainfall, and that the bacteria populations associated with the root systems of B. menziesii differ from the other two, and that they also change depending on the age of the roots.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians have a {{skeletal}} {{system that is}} structurally homologous to other tetrapods, though {{with a number of}} variations. They all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs. The bones are hollow and lightweight. The musculo{{skeletal system}} is strong to <b>enable</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> support the head and body. The bones are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes. The pectoral girdle is supported by muscle, and the well-developed pelvic girdle is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs. The ilium slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{that feed}} on the spiny scallop include starfish, {{particularly}} the ochre star (Pisaster ochraceus) and the sunflower star (Pycnopodia helianthoides), octopuses and sea otters. The scallop can swim and does so to escape from predators, repeatedly opening and shutting its valves in a clapping action. Each time the valves close, water is expelled through {{a gap in the}} mantle on the dorsal side of the hinge and the animal moves margin first, a form of jet propulsion. It has chemoreceptors on the mantle margins which detect the approach of a starfish and <b>enable</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> take evasive action. It also responds in this way to predators that feed on sponges, such as nudibranchs of the genus Archidoris spp..|$|E

5|$|During {{the threat}} display, any sudden {{movement}} by the intruder may provoke the mamba {{into a series}} of rapid strikes leading to severe envenomation. Also, the size of the black mamba, plus its ability to raise its head well off the ground, <b>enable</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> launch as much as 40% of its body length upwards, so mamba bites in humans quite often are on the upper body. This behaviour also permits the snake to land a strike at unexpectedly long range. The black mamba's reputed readiness to attack is often much exaggerated and usually is provoked by perceived threats, such as blocking its intended retreat, accidentally or otherwise.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 Sheffield City Council {{negotiated}} with Yorkshire Water and leased an unused {{part of the}} former sewage works for 99 years, at an annual rent of one peppercorn, to <b>enable</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be reclaimed {{and turned into a}} nature reserve. In order to manage the project, a consortium was formed, with representation from Sheffield City Council, Sheffield Wildlife Trust, South Yorkshire Forest and Yorkshire Water. It now provides habitat for migrating birds, for which it is an area of European significance. The Wildlife Trust run an active programme of school education visits. In 2005 the City Council exercised an option to increase the size of the reserve by taking over additional land from Yorkshire Water.|$|E
5|$|Repairs {{were made}} during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars with France, and the castle was modernised to <b>enable</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> hold 24-pounder (10.8kg) guns. Fresh fears of {{invasion}} followed in the 1850s, leading to heavier, 32-pounder (14.5kg) armament being installed and new gun batteries being laid out {{on both sides of}} the castle. Technological developments rapidly made these defences obsolete, however, and a fresh phase of work between 1861 and 1874 created sixty-one gun positions in two long, granite-faced batteries alongside the older castle. These held very heavy weapons, including massive 12.5 inch, 38 ton (317mm, 39,000kg) rifled muzzle-loading guns. As the century progressed, these too became outdated and lighter, quick-firing guns were installed at the castle to replace them.|$|E

5|$|Seldom observed, the {{frilled shark}} may capture prey by bending its body and lunging forward like a snake. The long, {{extremely}} flexible jaws <b>enable</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> swallow prey whole, while its many rows of small, needle-like teeth {{make it difficult}} for the prey to escape. It feeds mainly on cephalopods, leavened by bony fishes and other sharks. This species is aplacental viviparous: the embryos emerge from their egg capsules inside the mother's uterus, where they survive primarily on yolk. The gestation period may be as long as three and a half years, the longest of any vertebrate. Litter sizes vary from two to fifteen, and there is no distinct breeding season. Frilled sharks are occasional bycatch in commercial fisheries, but have little economic value.|$|E
5|$|The English had {{established}} a number of forts on the Leinster bank of the river, including Fort Frankford and, later, Fort Falkland (see Military History). The garrison at Fort Falkland was overrun {{by the forces of}} the Confederate Catholics in 1642 but was recaptured by Cromwell's army in 1650. The Cromwellians established a new fortification on the Connacht bank of the river leading up to the plantation of Connacht in 1654. The castle was modified in 1817 to <b>enable</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> mount artillery with a platform for a 24-pound traversing gun constructed on its roof. Its interior became a powder magazine and housed a garrison of 20 soldiers.|$|E
5|$|The broad, heavily calcified {{jaws and}} nearly {{terminal}} mouth, combined with robust, serrated teeth, enable the tiger shark {{to take on}} these large prey. In addition, excellent eyesight and acute sense of smell <b>enable</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> react to faint traces of blood and follow them to the source. The ability to pick up low-frequency pressure waves enables the shark to advance towards an animal with confidence, even in murky water. The shark circles its prey and studies it by prodding it with its snout. When attacking, the shark often eats its prey whole, although larger prey are often eaten in gradual large bites and finished over time.|$|E
