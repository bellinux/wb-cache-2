25|$|In {{response}} to the protests, foreign minister Nasser Judeh said the government had tried {{to respond to the}} opposition over the past year with the establishment of an <b>independent</b> <b>elections</b> <b>commission</b> before balloting set for January 2013 and the formation of a constitutional court, among other changes.|$|R
2500|$|The most {{problematic}} {{conflict of}} interest may be {{the fact that the}} country's <b>Independent</b> <b>Elections</b> <b>Commission</b> (IEC) that oversees the whole election is not [...] "independent" [...] of the Karzai administration at all. All seven of its members were appointed to the commission by Hamid Karzai, and its chairman, a former Karzai advisor in Herat province, has reportedly made no secret of his partisan support for the incumbent president.|$|R
25|$|Presidential {{candidate}} Mirwais Yasini, {{the deputy}} {{speaker of the}} lower house of parliament, lodged 31 complaints with Afghanistan's <b>Independent</b> <b>Election</b> <b>Commission</b> (IEC), telling the BBC that both main camps had engaged in widespread electoral fraud.|$|E
25|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the election, Karzai's main challenger, Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, denounced {{the chairman of the}} IEC as working for Mr. Karzai. Foreign election observers have also criticized the <b>Independent</b> <b>Election</b> <b>Commission</b> as being full of Karzai appointees.|$|E
25|$|The run-off {{campaign}} period formally {{opened on}} October 24.

40|$|Elections play {{a crucial}} role in {{political}} stability in post-democratization, and electoral administrations are the key to the electoral process. However, not all newly democratized countries have established reliable electoral administration. New democracies in Southeast Asia, such as the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand, have <b>independent</b> <b>election</b> <b>commissions</b> which have different characteristics, especially in terms of neutrality. Based on three cases, this paper claims that the stakes of politics are the major determinant of the variations in neutrality. The high stakes of politics in Thailand brought about the partisan <b>election</b> <b>commission,</b> while the low stakes in Indonesia made the electoral system relatively neutral. Like Thailand, the high stakes of politics in the Philippines also cause political intervention in the electoral administration...|$|R
25|$|The <b>Independent</b> <b>Election</b> <b>Commission</b> {{indicated}} {{that results from}} 447 polling stations, or 200,000 ballots, had already been quarantined and flagged to the ECC for investigation, and that the figure could rise to 660 polling stations {{and as many as}} 500,000 ballots.|$|E
25|$|With Karzai {{passing the}} 50 per cent {{threshold}} but confrontated with allegations of massive fraud, a crisis emerged when a recount of ballots was ordered. That demand was {{challenged by the}} Afghan-dominated <b>Independent</b> <b>Election</b> <b>Commission</b> (IEC), which went on to publish the results, effectively giving Karzai the victory.|$|E
25|$|According to an IEC {{official}} and a Western official in Afghanistan, the <b>Independent</b> <b>Election</b> <b>Commission</b> introduced {{a set of}} standards to exclude questionable votes on August 29, but when {{it appeared that the}} new exclusions would put Karzai's tally below 50%, the commission cast a second vote on September 7 to loosen the fraud standards.|$|E
50|$|Canada's ten {{provinces and}} Yukon {{use the same}} {{plurality}} voting system used in federal elections.

25|$|Ramazan Bashardost, the {{candidate}} likely to place {{third in the}} election, said the <b>Independent</b> <b>Election</b> <b>Commission</b> (IEC) officials were breaking electoral law by announcing results before the Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC) had completed its work.

25|$|Forty-four {{candidates}} had {{registered for}} the presidential election when the <b>Independent</b> <b>Election</b> <b>Commission</b> of Afghanistan (IEC) announced its official preliminary list of registered candidates on May 17, 2009.

Each presidential candidate ran with two vice-presidential candidates.|$|E
25|$|The {{day before}} the {{election}}, Afghan election officials ordered more than 440 polling stations to stay closed during the vote out of fears of election fraud. The <b>Independent</b> <b>Election</b> <b>Commission</b> (IEC) said Hamid Karzai's supporters were trying to keep open polling stations deep within insurgent-held regions where the army and police fear going and where voting could not be properly monitored by observers.|$|E
50|$|On 14 January 2016, a law {{was adopted}} {{creating}} a new electoral <b>commission,</b> the <b>Independent</b> National <b>Election</b> <b>Commission</b> (Commission nationale électorale indépendante, CNEI), replacing the National Commission for the Organisation of <b>Elections</b> (<b>Commission</b> nationale d’organisation des élections, CONEL).

The CNEI is composed of members of both government and opposition parties, as well as civil society, and unlike the CONEL it is set up to be independent and financially autonomous.|$|R

Later, introducing complete proportional representation to the House of Representatives in the 2016 parliamentary election, introducing decentralization in the 2017 local elections, and reforming the judiciary.|$|E
25|$|Under the 2004 constitution, {{elections}} {{should have}} been held no later than 60 days {{before the end of}} President Karzai's term in July 2009. The <b>Independent</b> <b>Election</b> <b>Commission</b> (IEC) originally recommended that the poll be held {{at the same time as}} the 2010 parliamentary balloting to save costs. However, politicians in the country were unable to agree to the details. Concerns about accessibility to mountainous areas in spring 2009 and the ability of getting adequate people and materials in place by then led the IEC to announce the elections would be delayed to August 2009.|$|E

50|$|When the province's final seat {{allotment}} is determined, an <b>independent</b> <b>election</b> boundaries <b>commission</b> in each province {{reviews the}} existing boundaries and proposes adjustments. Public input is then sought, which may then lead {{to changes in}} the final boundary proposal. For instance, the proposed boundaries may not accurately reflect a community's historical, political or economic relationship with its surrounding region; the community would thus advise the boundary commission that it wished to be included in a different electoral district.|$|R
