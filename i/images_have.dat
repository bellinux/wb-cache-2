5|$|Italian {{artist and}} {{engraver}} Agostino Aglio, starting in 1826, {{became the first}} to transcribe and illustrate the codex completely for Lord Kingsborough, who published it in his nine volumes of Antiquities of Mexico in 18311848. The codex then had some damage due to handling, sunlight, and moisture. It received direct water damage that was significantly destructive from being kept in a flooded basement during the bombing of Dresden in World War II. German historian G. Zimmerman noted that the damage was extreme on pages 2, 4, 24, 28, 34, 38, 71 and 72. Certain details of the glyph <b>images</b> <b>have</b> been lost because of this. This shows when the current codex is compared to the Kingsborough copies of 1831-1848 and the Förstemann facsimile editions of 1880 and 1892.|$|E
5|$|The {{depiction}} of Christ in pictorial form was highly controversial {{in the early}} church. From the 5th century onward, flat painted icons became popular in the Eastern Church. The Byzantine Iconoclasm acted {{as a barrier to}} developments in the East, but by the ninth century, art was permitted again. The Protestant Reformation brought renewed resistance to imagery, but total prohibition was atypical, and Protestant objections to <b>images</b> <b>have</b> tended to reduce since the 16th century. Although large images are generally avoided, few Protestants now object to book illustrations depicting Jesus. The use of depictions of Jesus is advocated by the leaders of denominations such as Anglicans and Catholics and is a key element of the Eastern Orthodox tradition.|$|E
5|$|The {{images of}} Uttararama follow a {{different}} style from {{the images of the}} previous Anuradhapura period, and show some significant differences. The identity of the standing image is subject to a certain amount of dispute among historians and archaeologists, some of whom argue that it depicts the monk Ananda rather than the Buddha. Each of the <b>images</b> <b>have</b> been carved in a way that uses a maximum possible area of the rock, and their heights seem to have been decided based on the height of the rock itself. Each statue appears to have had its own image house, as indicated by the remains of brick walls at the site. The Uttararama was where Parakramabahu I held a congregation of monks to purify the Buddhist priesthood, and later drew up a code of conduct for them. This code of conduct has been recorded in an inscription on the same rock face containing the images of the Buddha.|$|E
