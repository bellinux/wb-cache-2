This thesis presents a modular approach in reengineering existing upper-level ontologies to conceptualize specific domain knowledge. The aim of extending these upper-level ontologies is to tailor and transform the existing conceptual models into new ones designed for the use in a specific domain in the earth sciences. This thesis extends the upper-level Semantic Web for Earth and <b>Environmental</b> <b>Terminology</b> (SWEET) ontologies to develop ontologies {{for part of the}} hydrogeology domain.

Rob’s research at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory encompassed the fields of atmospheric science and GIScience. He was also interested in semantic interoperability and the development of common ontologies to foster sharing heterogeneous scientific data across knowledge communities. He founded the well-known Semantic Web for Earth and <b>Environmental</b> <b>Terminology</b> (SWEET), a modular and extensible set of upper-level ontologies for Earth system science. Rob was {{a founding member of the}} Spatial Decision Support (SDS) Consortium and a major contributor to the development to the SDS ontology.

RDF data reflect the use of entities, such as classes or properties {{of one or more}} appropriate ontologies. For enhanced interoperability, it is best to adopt existing ontologies when available. Domain ontologies such as the Semantic Web for Earth and <b>Environmental</b> <b>Terminology</b> SWEET ontology 60 from NASA or the Semantic Sensor Net SSN ontology 61 from W 3 C 62 are good starting points for the creation of an ontology for a particular domain. There are also terminological ontologies containing controlled vocabularies for the tagging and indexing of resources of the geo and space science domain, such as GEMET (General Multilingual Environmental Thesaurus GEMET 2012).|$|E

Working together is success. ” • “If everyone {{is moving forward}} together, then success takes care of itself. ” The First Step – A Plan. Environmental stewardship requires that an effective environmental management approach (i. e., plan or model) exists, is recognized, and is implemented for each environmental issue of concern. If each component of the turfgrass industry (golf courses, sod farms, athletic facilities, landscape areas, etc.) cannot define, articulate, and support an effective environmental management approach, then we cannot complain if others do the task for us – even {{in a manner that}} we may not like. Or, to put it is other terms, the critical first step in addressing any problem is to develop a plan that will truly address the problem. Without a unified plan rising out of the turfgrass industry, different components of the industry will likely develop diverse <b>environmental</b> management approaches, <b>terminology,</b> and regulatory approaches for different components of the turfgrass industry and each unique environmental issue. The net result will be diverse chaos and most likely, a strong tendenc...|$|R
40|$|Congenital corneal {{opacification}} (CCO) {{encompasses a}} broad spectrum of disorders that have different etiologies, including genetic and <b>environmental.</b> <b>Terminology</b> used in clinical phenotyping is commonly not specific enough to describe separate entities, for example both the terms Peters anomaly and sclerocornea have been ascribed to a clinical picture of total CCO, without investigating {{the presence or absence of}} iridocorneal adhesions. This is not only confusing but also unhelpful in determining valid genotype-phenotype correlations, and thereby revealing clues for pathogenesis. We undertook a systematic review of the literature focusing on CCO as part of anterior segment developmental anomalies (ASDA), and analyzed its association specifically with chromosomal abnormalities. Genes previously identified as being associated with CCO are also summarized. All reports were critically appraised to classify phenotypes according to described features, rather than the given diagnosis. Some interesting associations were found, and are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is {{considered}} {{as the most}} advanced tool for improving the environmental performance of products. There are however barriers that reduce its implementation, especially in small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs), such as data intensity, costs, and expertise required to run the LCA studies. The European project 'LCA to go' develops sectoral methods and tools for bio-based plastics, industrial machinery, electronics (including printed circuit boards, semiconductors and passive components), renewable energy, sensors and smart textiles. These sectors have been chosen, as the manufacturers show a high interest in making clear the environmental benefits of their products to customers and in prioritizing so they can reduce their environmental impacts. The project has to bridge the language gap between the <b>environmental</b> <b>terminology</b> used in LCAs and the engineering language of product developers. The overall goal of the project is to develop LCA webtoo ls customized for SMEs...|$|E
40|$|Although {{the use of}} formalised <b>environmental</b> <b>terminology</b> {{nowadays}} gets {{popular in}} practice, the full benefit that {{can be drawn from}} it them is by far not yet reached. In terms of expressivity, the most advanced form of environmental terminologies are ontologies which are specified formally by means of formal logics. The availability of formal ontologies promotes automation of content provision and integrated access to structured and unstructured information resources via customised user interfaces for domain experts and public users. The paper introduces mechanisms for semantic annotation and automatic classification as essential base technologies that open the door to better information discovery, analysis and integration. We report experiences of their application in selected projects, namely the development of semantic extensions for geospatial catalogues {{in the context of the}} ORCHESTRA project and ontology-based information integration of environmental information systems in Baden-Württemberg/Germany. Thereby, special attention is paid to the fact that semantic extensions exert a minimum of impact to the available, grown infrastructure for conventional information retrieval...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Linked Science is the {{practice}} of inter-connecting scientific assets by publishing, sharing and linking scientific data and processes in end-to-end loosely coupled workflows that allow the sharing and re-use of scientific data. Much of this data does not live in the cloud or on the Web, but rather in multiinstitutional data centers that provide tools and add value through quality assurance, validation, curation, dissemination, {{and analysis of the}} data. In this paper, we make the case for the use of scientific scenarios in Linked Science. We propose a scenario in river-channel transport that requires biogeochemical experimental data and global climate-simulation model data from many sources. We focus on the use of ontologies—formal machine-readable descriptions of the domain—to facilitate search and discovery of this data. Mercury, developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, is a tool for distributed metadata harvesting, search and retrieval. Mercury currently provides uniform access to more than 100, 000 metadata records; 30, 000 scientists use it each month. We augmented search in Mercury with ontologies, such as the ontologies in the Semantic Web for Earth and <b>Environmental</b> <b>Terminology</b> (SWEET) collection by prototyping a component that provides access to the ontology terms from Mercury. We evaluate the coverage of SWEET for the ORNL Distributed Active Archive Center (ORNL DAAC) ...|$|E

An action based curriculum aims {{to enhance}} the formation {{and development of the}} human personality by teaching ecological values, knowledge, attitudes, and skills with respect to environmental issues, their understanding, and commitment to be involved in environmental action. In this thesis, five curricula from selected various countries were analyzed, explored, and compared in order to investigate whether they contained certain objectives, <b>environmental</b> <b>terminology</b> and activities that lead students to take environmental action. Four curricula, Ontario, Canada; England, Britain; Turkey; and International Baccalaureate Primary Years programme (IBPYP), were analyzed and compared to the Environmental Education Curriculum for Middle School from the United Nations Environmental Programme {{in order to be able}} to determine best practices that encourage and teach environmental action. Educators from elementary education and officers from non-governmental environmental organizations were interviewed to determine their opinions on environmental education within Turkey and the basic elements of an action-based curriculum. Curriculum analysis results and the transcription of interviews were used to prepare recommendations for an action-based environmental curriculum that enables students to acquire environmental knowledge, skills and activities that would lead them to action in finding and implementing solutions to environmental problems.
