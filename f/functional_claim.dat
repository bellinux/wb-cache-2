40|$|This {{essay is}} {{concerned}} with two explanations of why oppressive social orders persist. According to the first, the so-called gunman theory of oppression (GT), these social orders persist because the oppressed are afraid being punished if they participated in a revolt. According to the second, the so-called ideology theory of oppression (IT), oppression persists because the oppressed are subject to ideology. Traditionally, the former {{has been associated with}} rational choice theory, and the latter with Marxism and critical theory. Analytical philosophers have been suspicious of IT since it involves functional claims. This essay shows {{that it is possible to}} make sense of both IT and its associated <b>functional</b> <b>claim</b> within the framework of rational choice theory. Chapter one provides an overview of the discussion and a presentation of the general argument against IT. Chapter two specifies the explanandum for the two theories in more detail. The chapter concludes with a description of three real-life persistent oppressive social orders. In chapter three, the basics of rational choice theory are introduced and GT spelled out. Some problems for the theory are identified and then dealt with. It is concluded that GT does a good job at explaining the persistence of tyrannies. Chapter four argues that ideology is necessary to provide satisfactory explanations of the other two cases of oppression described in chapter two. The chapter concludes with a specification of IT where the <b>functional</b> <b>claim</b> is made explicit. Chapter five defends Gerald Cohen's account of functional explanations against a dilemma formulated by Ann Cudd. In chapter six, three mechanisms are provided that indicate how the <b>functional</b> <b>claim</b> of IT can be demystified. Chapter seven concludes by indicating a statistical method for testing IT and describing some policy implications. EXPLANATIONS OF REPRESSION BY A MINORITY OF THE MAJORITY — A RESEARCH PROGRA...|$|E

40|$|<b>Functional</b> <b>claiming</b> {{has been}} the issue {{at the heart of}} the {{software}} patent problem. <b>Functional</b> <b>claiming</b> is particularly problematic in software patents as inventors may use them to broadly claim an entire goal instead of a particular implementation. The accumulation of such software patents has created a patent thicket, leading to their abuse by patent trolls, causing extended litigation, and making it difficult for patent examiners to search through prior art. This paper presents an alternate approach by using nonobviousness to tackle the software problem in two phases: first during prosecution to prevent <b>functional</b> <b>claims</b> from being issued and second, post grant, through Markman hearings to retroactively invalidate <b>functional</b> <b>claims</b> prior to trial. By applying a nonobviousness filter, both the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office and courts can more efficiently weed out overbroad functional patents by focusing on the merits of the invention and the scope of claims instead of getting bogged down in determining whether a claim meets the requisite structural elements of § 112 (f) in order to then narrow the claim through the statute...|$|R

If it recedes {{for a long}} enough part of the year, it might become feasible to use the Northwest Passage for commercial shipping. That might {{pose a threat to}} Canadian claim of sovereignty over the Northwest Passage (NWP). A key component of Canadian assertion of sovereignty over the NWP is based on the concept of <b>functional</b> <b>claim</b> via enforcement of environmental regulations in the NWP. These environmental regulations were introduced after the voyage of American oil tanker SS Manhattan in 1969 through the Northwest Passage.

40|$|Women’s {{participation}} in a post-conflict peace process has been given an important role.

Despite the important role associated with women’s {{participation in}} post-conflict peace process the conditions that enhance women’s participation in international interventions in post-conflict peacebuilding process seems lacking or under-researched. This study contributes to this under-researched phenomenon by asking the question “what conditions enhance women’s participation in international interventions in post-conflict peacebuilding processes”?  To find out the causal mechanism that increases women’s participation, I conducted a structured and focused comparison of two UNPSO in Liberia in which one implements a 1325 mandated approach, so as to explore my theoretical argument that “an international intervention that implements a 1325 mandated approach increases women’s participation“. The empirical analyses suggest support for the theoretical explanations that a 1325 mandated approach promotes gender equality through raising awareness, provides gender sensitive rules, builds women’s capacity which all increase women’s participation in the post-conflict peacebuilding process. Although a 1325 mandated approach increases women’s participation, their {{active role in the}} decision-making process remains low compared to their physical representation and contribution. The findings also have shed light on some other factors that could {{have a significant effect on}} the explanatory powers of the observed variables.

40|$|The present paper {{looks into}} the {{intersection}} between technical standard development activities and patenting activities {{from the perspective of}} patent prosecution. Specifically, attention is paid to the tendency that the obtainment of patents related to technical standards is often done through the utilization of the systems allowing patent applicants to file new applications (collectively called continuing applications under the US patent system) enjoying the benefit of the filing dates of earlier-filed patent applications. After presenting some empirical evidence to show the tendency (in other words, the relevance of the continuing application system to patenting technical standards), this paper focuses upon the written description requirement as an important factor affecting the patentability of such continuing applications. In this paper, I make concrete proposals for the enhancement of the capacity of the written description requirement to suppress the abusive use of the continuing application system to cover technical standards as well as competitors' products and processes, without prejudice to innovative inventors' opportunities to mine their original disclosure in patent specifications for the exclusive rights they deserve. These proposals of mine include the reduction of burden of proof, to the patent challenger's side, of incompliance of a claim in a continuing application with the written description requirement, when certain conditions are met, and some examples of ways to achieve such reduction of burden of proof. This paper also presents comparative review of the continuing application systems under the European and Japanese patent systems as well as the US patent system. Based upon the review, relevant international harmonization considerations are discussed as well. patent, prosecution, technical standards, continuing application, continuation, division, CIP, priority right, earlier filing date, written description requirement, support, implicit and inherent disclosure, burden of proof, burden of production, prima-facie evidence, <b>functional</b> <b>claim,</b> omission of an element, international harmonization...|$|E
40|$|Fermentation {{has been}} an {{integral}} process applied to products constituting the human diet since ancient times and fermentation processes passed from sacred ceremonies of community sharing to everyday life meals, regardless of the cultural society concerned (Garine et al., 2001). However, fermented foods remain a partial mystery that tools such as proteomics can investigate deeper. Proteomics has recently helped archeologists to decipher the ancient human dairy activities from at least the 2 nd century BC and {{to show that they}} were close to those used at the present time namely for Kefir making (Hong et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2014). Fermented food products represent up to 30 % of our daily diet and are the major source of ingested living bacteria (Olivares et al., 2006). Dietary deprivation of fermented food products causes a decline in the innate immune response that can be prevented by the consumption of yogurt (Olivares et al., 2006), highlighting the important role of fermented milk products in the human diet. This is supported by the fact that yogurt is {{one of the very few}} alleged fermented products with an EFSA-accepted <b>functional</b> <b>claim,</b> regarding lactose intolerancealleviation (EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, 2010). Milk fermentation was a prerequisite for its conservation in the absence of the cold chain. Hundreds of fermented milk products have evolved throughout the world and these products possess varied appearance, texture, flavor, taste, and health benefits, thanks to the association of various microorganisms with milk (and its derived product the whey) and with human knowledge. Fermented milk products, that is, yogurts, fermented milks used as beverages such as Kefir and Koumiss, and a huge number of cheeses, harbor ecosystems ranging from simple to highly complex. They consist of (1) milk matrices arising from various mammals (cow, goat, ewe, mare, camel, yak, etc.) having a variable composition in proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, minerals and (2) microorganisms belonging to various phylogenetic groups (firmicutes, eukaryotes, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria) present within and at the surface of the product, most notably on some cheese varieties. Proteomic investigations are particularly relevant for such food products, as proteins act both as the supplier and substrate of enzymes, during milk proteolysis and degradation of bacterial proteins, a point that is addressed by peptidomics. Furthermore, bacteria in theseproducts also have dual functionality as producers of bioactive compounds and as probiotic agents. The increase in the number of sequenced genomes facilitates greater knowledge of the bacterial machinery. Only proteomic tools are able to show definitively the end products of the enzymatic machinery and thus assess its efficiency within the milk environment and through the technological processes applied. However, hedonic quality and health properties cannot be extrapolated to all fermented milk products. The remarkable biodiversity in substrates and microorganisms requires fine characterization of each fermentation process and/or functional fermented foods. In this chapter, we will give an overview of the major breakthroughs performed thanks to proteomics analyses: from pure culture to complex fermented products such as cheeses, with a particular interest in fermented milk product quality and probiotic effects...|$|E
40|$|This article {{broadens}} {{the empirical}} and conceptual perspective on sovereign wealth funds (SWFs). This is first done through providing {{a definition of}} contemporary SWFs. Using recent literature it suggests that SWFs can be differentiated into discrete categories {{in terms of their}} funding, governance and investment structures. Using this definition, the subsequent history section identifies earlier instances of SWFs in the context of 17 th century financial mercantilism and 1930 s monetary mercantilism. This leads directly to a number of investment deals in the 2000 s where some countries with SWFs were subject to intense media and government scrutiny. In the aftermath, commentators warned of protectionism and a resurgence in financial and monetary mercantilism by pointing to emerging economies, most notably China. Though contemporary SWFs {{are not the same as}} earlier state-related pools of capital, there are important similarities concerning policy-relevant variables, highlighted by the SWF literature.

Studies comparing whole grains to their refined grain counterparts were considered, as were studies comparing different grain types.

Clinical trials show that whole grain wheat, maize, and barley alter the human gut microbiota, but these findings are based on a few studies that do not include satiety components, so no <b>functional</b> <b>claims</b> between microbiota and satiety can be made. Ten satiety trials were evaluated and provide evidence that whole oats, barley, and rye can increase satiety, whereas the evidence for whole wheat and maize is not compelling.

Once understanding the impact of whole grains on satiety and microbiota is more developed, then particular grains might be used for better appetite control. With this information at hand, healthcare professionals could make individual dietary recommendations that promote satiety and contribute to weight control...|$|R

The systematic {{investigation of the}} interactions between food components or food ingredients and genomic, biochemical, cellular, or physiological functions is a unique way to improve both our knowledge {{and the role of}} nutrition in maintaining good health and in preventing disease. However, such basic knowledge is insufficient to justify claims, unless it is confirmed through relevant nutrition studies aimed at demonstrating the same effect and its positive consequences in humans. In the first stage, this demonstration will in most cases justify <b>functional</b> (physiological) <b>claims</b> (e. g., bifidogenic effect for fructooligosaccharides, bulking effect for nondigestible carbohydrates, protection against oxidative stress for antioxidants) with no reference to any health benefit. A true health claim will require, in most cases, additional studies involving large populations and long-term trials. It is anticipated that the better we understand the mechanism of interactions between food components and specific biological functions, the more {{we will be able to}} demonstrate functional effects, and the easier it will be to accumulate convincing evidence in favor of health promotion or disease prevention. Because of both its direct contact with eaten foods and the diversity of its functions, the GI system is a potential target for many functional effects.

Recently, it has become a well-established candidate in causing positive brain and nerve health-related activities by inducing nerve growth factor (NGF) from its bioactive ingredient, erinacine A. This active compound, which exists only in fermented mycelium but not in its fruiting body, increases NGF levels in astroglial cells in vitro as well as catecholamine and NGF levels in vivo. With increasing recognition of erinacine A in H. erinaceus (EAHE) mycelium improving neurodegenerative diseases, numerous products are being marketed based on these <b>functional</b> <b>claims.</b> To our knowledge, there have been no reports on the mutagenicity of EAHE prior to this paper. Hence, the present study was undertaken to determine the mutagenicity and genotoxicity effects of EAHE mycelium conducted in three standard battery of tests (reverse mutation, chromosomal aberration, and micronuclei tests) according to the latest guidelines in order to meet all international regulatory requirements and provide information on the safety of this new and promising natural remedy. Our results have indicated that EAHE mycelium did not significantly increase the number of revertant colonies in the bacterial reverse mutation test nor induce higher frequency of aberrations in the chromosome aberration test. Moreover, no statistically significant EAHE mycelium-related increase was observed in the incidence of reticulocytes per 1000 red blood cells and micronucleated reticulocytes per 1000 reticulocytes.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} community {{engagement with}} {{the health benefits of}} dietary fibre (DF) and its potential as a framework for the promotion of increased consumption of resistant starch (RS). Setting: A nationwide postal Food and Health Survey conducted in Australia by CSIRO Human Nutrition. Subjects: Adults aged 18 years and above, selected at random from the Australian Electoral Roll (n 849). Design: A cross-sectional design was employed to analyse ratings of (i) the importance of various RS health and <b>functional</b> <b>claims</b> and (ii) receptiveness to different foods as RS delivery vehicles, according to the respondents’ level of fibre engagement as classified under the Precaution Adoption Process Model (PAPM) of Health Behaviour. Results: There was a high level of recognition (89 ? 5 %) of DF as being important for health. Significant gender differences were found for ratings of RS attributes and RS delivery options. Women were both more fibre-engaged than men and more receptive than men to RS and its potential benefits. Ratings of the acceptability of several foods as means of delivering RS revealed a general preference for healthy staples over indulgences, with the margin between acceptability of staples and indulgences increasing markedly with increased fibre engagement. Conclusions: Application of the PAPM to awareness of DF reveals a ready-made target group for health messages about RS and pockets of differential potential receptiveness. The findings support the promotion of RS as providing health benefits of DF with the added reduction of risk of serious disease, its delivery through healthy staples and the targeting of messages at both fibre-engaged individuals and women in general.

40|$|As is broadly recognized, {{the realm}} of {{administrative}} power greatly expanded over the course the twentieth century (particularly after 1945). This essay argues that this expansion, along with differential conceptions of legitimacy deeply bound up with it, are crucial to understanding not just the modern administrative state but also the nature of EU governance and the law governing its operation. Despite a dominant paradigm that seeks to understand EU governance in autonomously democratic and constitutional terms, the legitimacy of integration {{as a whole has}} remained primarily ‘administrative, not constitutional’. The EU’s normative power, like all power of an ultimately administrative character, finds its legitimacy primarily in legal, technocratic and <b>functional</b> <b>claims.</b> This is not to deny that European integration involves ‘politics’ or has profound ‘constitutional’ implications for its member states or citizens. The ‘administrative, not constitutional’ paradigm is meant only to stress that the ultimate grounding of EU rulemaking, enforcement, and adjudication comes closer to the sort of administrative legitimacy that is mediated through national executives, national courts, and national parliaments to a much greater extent than the dominant paradigm supposes. This is the reality that the ‘administrative, not constitutional’ paradigm on EU law has always sought to emphasize, and it is one that is particularly pertinent to the integration process in times of crisis. It is unsurprising, in these circumstances, that the public law of European integration has continually resorted to mechanisms of nationally mediated legitimacy in order to ‘borrow’ legitimacy from the national level. Unless and until Europeans begin to experience democracy and constitutionalism in supranational terms, the ‘administrative, not constitutional’ paradigm suggests that the EU’s judicial doctrines must be adjusted. The purpose should be to address the persistent disconnect between supranational regulatory power and its robust sources of democratic and constitutional legitimacy on the national level...|$|R

Both logic and <b>functional</b> programming <b>claim</b> the ability of writing parsers in a natural and concise way. We address here the task from a functional-logic perspective. By modelling parsers as non-deterministic functions we achieve a very natural manner of building parsers, which combines the nicest properties of the functional and logic approaches. In particular, {{we are able to}} easily define within our framework parsers in a style very close to the `monadic parsers' of functional programming, but without any syntactic overhead. In a different direction we show that, if the functional-logic setting permits higher-order patterns while defining functions, parsers can be freely manipulated as data. This allows programming useful metalevel analysis or transformations, like discovering if the grammar corresponding to a given parser is LL(1). Finally, we sketch the potential application to parsing of f [...] ...|$|R
40|$|While the <b>claim</b> {{that certain}} <b>functional</b> states are {{sufficient}} for conscious experience has received substantial critical attention, the <b>claim</b> that <b>functional</b> states are necessary is rarely addressed. Yet the latter claim is perhaps now {{more common than}} the former. I aim to revive and revise a neglected argument against the necessity claim, by Michael Antony. The argument involves manipulating a conscious subject's brain so as to cancel a disposition which is supposedly crucial to the realization of an experience that the subject is having at the time. The key step in the argument is to show that, contrary to what the <b>functional</b> necessity <b>claim</b> implies, the experience can survive such a manipulation. I defend that key step in a new way, by arguing that since the manipulation cannot influence the subject's thoughts, emotions, or behavior, {{there is no reason}} to suppose that it alters his conscious experience...|$|R
50|$|The {{functional}} food industry, consisting of food, beverage and supplement sectors, {{is one of}} the several areas of the food industry that is experiencing fast growth in recent years. It is estimated that the global market of {{functional food}} industry will reach 176.7 billion in 2013 with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.4%. Specifically, the functional food sector will experience 6.9% CAGR, the supplement sector will rise by 3.8% and the functional beverage sector will be the fastest growing segment with 10.8% CAGR. This kind of growth is fueled not only by industrial innovation and development of new products that satisfy the demand of health conscious consumers but also by health claims covering a wide range of health issues. Yet, consumer skepticism persists mainly because benefits associated with consuming the products may be difficult to be detected. Strict examination of some of the <b>functional</b> food <b>claims</b> may discourage some companies from launching their products.|$|R
50|$|While many admired Marshall, he {{was highly}} {{critical}} and argumentative about others’ views. He repeatedly argued with psychologists who sough physiological explanations for psychological events, pegging these individuals as too dependent on natural sciences. Marshall was also critical of behaviorists. He claimed that behaviorists were truly confused in believing that behavior {{should have been}} the target of psychology. Henry repeatedly chastised behaviorists claiming to be the only real psychologists. Understandably, many individuals who viewed psychology from a physiological or behaviorist perspective grew to dislike him. Marshall went on to attack <b>functional</b> psychology and <b>claim</b> that it wasn’t a real branch of psychology.|$|R

The metal is then cast in the conventional way. The position of the form is so chosen that the flow speed of liquid metal is low {{in the vicinity of}} the <b>functional</b> element. Also <b>claimed</b> is a suitable cast assembly. USE - The cast assembly is a lightweight structure for use in e. g. aerospace applications, automotive motor blocks etc. ADVANTAGE - The heat-screened elements retain their function after casting...|$|R
