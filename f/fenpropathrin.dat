50|$|The {{earliest}} pyrethoids {{are related}} to pyrethrin I and II by changing the alcohol group of the ester of chrysanthemic acid. This relatively modest change can lead to substantially altered activities. For example, the 5-benzyl-3-furanyl ester called resmethrin is only weakly toxic to mammals (LD50 (rat, oral) = 2,000 mg/kg) but is 20-50 times more effective than natural pyrethrum and is also readily biodegraded. Other commercially important esters include tetramethrin, allethrin, phenothrin, barthrin, dimethrin, and bioresmethrin. Another family of pyrethroids have altered acid fragment together with altered alcohol components. These require more elaborate organic synthesis. Members of this extensive class include the dichlorovinyl and dibromovinyl derivatives. Still others are tefluthrin, <b>fenpropathrin,</b> and bioethanomethrin.|$|E

Visual clustering on multidimensional scaling (MDS) maps based upon sodium ion channel and calcium influx and glutamate release dissimilarities gave similar groupings. The non-cyano containing pyrethroids were arrayed in a dose-dependent manner along two different factors that characterize the T-syndrome. Bifenthrin was an outlier when MDS maps of the non-cyano pyrethroids were based on sodium ion channel characteristics and permethrin was an outlier when the MDS maps were based on calcium influx/glutamate release potency. Four of six alpha-cyano pyrethroids (lambda-cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin and <b>fenpropathrin)</b> reduced open chloride channel probability. The R-isomers of lambda-l-cyhalothrin reduced open channel probability whereas the S-isomers, antagonized {{the action of the}} R-isomers. None of the non-cyano pyrethroids reduced open channel probability, except bioallethrin, which gave a weak response. Overall, based upon neurotoxicity data and the effect of pyrethroids on sodium, calcium and chloride ion channels, it is proposed that bioallethrin, cismethrin, tefluthrin, bifenthrin and permethrin belong to one common mechanism group and deltamethrin, lambda-cyhalothrin, cyfluthrin and cypermethrin belong to a second. <b>Fenpropathrin</b> and esfenvalerate occupy an intermediate position between these two groups...|$|E
40|$|A New Rearing Technique of Phytophagous Mite Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari : Tetranychida) and its Application in the Study of the Efficacy of some Acaricides on Potato [Solanum tuberosum L.). A 5 cm {{diameter}} leaf disc {{of potato}} or another host plant (or four on 2. 5 cm diameter) {{was used in}} a Petri dish of 9 cm diameter for the rearing technique. This leaf disc, pierced in its centre, slides along a rustproof pin and floats on a 1 mm thick lamina of demineralized fresh water. Water is a "strong barrier" which confines the tetranychid mites on the leaf disc, even if this one does not corne from a host plant (tetranychid mites deprived of food). This rearing technique {{was used as a}} bioassay to test the effectiveness of acaricides (pyrimiphos-methyl, bromopropylate, <b>fenpropathrin,</b> dienochlor) on the developmental stages of Tetranychus urticae. The ovicidal activity against the eggs of one, three, seven days old (the eggs incubation duration being 8. 1 ± 0. 15 days) was also studied. The results obtained show that bromopropylate, <b>fenpropathrin</b> and dienochlor have an ovicidal activity against the eggs of the different ages, but dienochlor has the highest efficiency (90 % mortality). Pyrimiphos-methyl is only active against the seven-day old eggs and bromopropylate has a high efficiency only on the one-day old eggs. Concerning the other developmental stages such as chrysalis (protochrysalis, deu-tochrysalis, teleiochrysalis) and mobile stages (larva, protonymph, deutonymph and adult female), pyrimiphos-methyl has de highest efficiency (90 % mortality); dienochlor also, except mobile stages. Bromopropylate has no activity against the chrysalis and mobile stages and <b>fenpropathrin</b> has a remarkable repulsive effect...|$|E
40|$|Pesticides can {{negatively}} affect many life history traits of natural enemies. In this study, we studied {{the effects of}} three insecticides with different modes of action on the bionomics of Encarsia formosa, a parasitoid of the greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood). Buprofezin (800 mg (a. i.) /L) and pyriproxyfen (50 mg (a. i.) /L) were selected among IGRs, while <b>fenpropathrin</b> (250 mg (a. i.) /L) was selected from the Pyrotheroids. Adults of E. formosa were treated via exposure to residues of insecticides on leaf discs. Our results revealed that buprofezin and pyriproxyfen did not affect longevity and fecundity, while <b>fenpropathrin</b> significantly reduced the longevity and fecundity of treated wasps. Results of logistic regression revealed that control, buprofezin- and pryproxyphen-treated E. formosa was a function of host density and followed a type II functional response. In contrast, E. formosa treated by <b>fenpropathrin</b> showed a type III functional response. Estimated attack rate for buprofezin and pyriproxyfen {{did not differ significantly}} from the control, whereas fenpropathrin-treated wasps showed a lower attack rate than the control. According to the obtained results, handling time of fenpropathrin-treated wasps was significantly higher (4. 57 ± 0. 5) than the control (2. 83 ± 0. 35). Our results showed that the maximum parasitism rate achieved by control wasps was 8. 39, while the rate for buprofezin-, pyriproxyfen- and fenpropathrin-treated wasps was 6. 99, 7. 69 and 5. 25, respectively. Overall, results suggest that buprofezin and pyriproxyfen can be used in an integrated pest management programme or biological control programme without destructive effects on the efficiency of this natural enemy in green houses...|$|E
40|$|Novel {{spectrophotometric}} {{methods were}} {{developed for the}} determination of <b>fenpropathrin</b> in insecticidal formulations and water samples. The methods {{were based on the}} hydrolysis of <b>fenpropathrin</b> with ethanolic KOH to form 3 -phenoxy benzaldehyde. The resultant aldehyde group was condensed with anthranilic acid in presence of basic medium to form yellowish red color product having λmax of 485 nm or condensed with 2 -chloro phenyl hydrazine to form pink color product having λmax of 557 nm. The color derivatives were correspondingly stable for 5 and 8 days. The Beer's law was obeyed over the range from 0. 03 - 10. 0 µg mL- 1 and molar absorptivity 2. 586 × 104 L mol- 1 cm- 1 for anthranilic acid and from 0. 02 - 8. 0 µg mL- 1 and molar absorptivity 3. 924 × 104 L mol- 1 cm- 1 for 2 -chloro phenyl hydrazine were observed.

40|$|Abstract: The citrus red mite, Panonychus citri (McGregor), is {{a global}} citrus pest, and has {{developed}} severe resistance to several types of acaricides. However, the molecular mechanisms of resistance in this mite remain unknown. In this study, seven full-length cDNAs encoding glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) genes were identified and characterized in P. citri. The effects of pyridaben and <b>fenpropathrin</b> exposure on the expression of these genes were also investigated. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the seven GSTs genes in P. citri cloned in this study belong to three different cytosolic classes, including four in mu, two in delta and one in zeta. Among these seven GSTs genes, the relative expression level of PcGSTm 1 was significantly higher in adult than in the other life stages (egg, larvae and nymph). Compared with the control, the mRNA levels of the seven GST genes did not change significantly following exposure to pyridaben at LC 10. However, RT-qPCR results showed that, when exposed to LC 10 of <b>fenpropathrin,</b> six GSTs gene (PcGSTm 1, PcGSTm 3, PcGSTm 4, PcGSTd 1, PcGSTd 2 and PcGSTz 1) transcripts increase...|$|E
40|$|Field {{studies were}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the effects of different insecticides as foliar application for the control of aphids population on canola (Brassica napus L.) crop. The insecticides Endosulfan (Thiodan 35 EC), <b>Fenpropathrin</b> (Sanitol 20 EC) and Dimethoate (Systoate 40 EC) were sprayed with knapsack sprayer at the normal recommended doses and a check plot was also maintained for comparison. The efficacy of these insecticides was assessed by counting the aphids mortality and their influences on grain yield on treated plots. Studies revealed that all the tested insecticides were superior and most promising for aphids management and provided better crop yield as compared to untreated plot (140 aphids per plant and 1707 g yield per 8 m 2). Endosulfan was proved highly toxic to control aphids population (4. 66 aphids plant - 1) and maximum yield was obtained (2322. 0 g/ 8 m 2) followed by <b>Fenpropathrin</b> and Dimethoate (6. 83, 13. 17 aphids plant - 1 and 2107. 0, 1948. 0 g/ 8 m 2 grain yield, respectively) ...|$|E
40|$|To enhance {{control of}} the glassy-winged {{sharpshooter}} (GWSS), relative toxicity of neonicotinoids, imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, and other conventional insecticides, chlorpyrifos, cyfluthrin and <b>fenpropathrin,</b> was examined to assess compatibility with parasitoids while being toxic to GWSS. Both imidacloprid and thiamethoxam when applied systemically through uptake in citrus leaves {{were found to be}} toxic to adult Gonatocerus ashmeadi and Aphytis melinus. However, systemic treatments of citrus and willow leaves infested with parasitized GWSS eggs did not impact the emergence of parasitoids significantly, suggesting they are relatively safe to the parasitoids while they are within the GWSS eggs. <b>Fenpropathrin,</b> a pyrethroid, was not toxic to G. ashmeadi for 3 - 4 days post-treatment while chlorpyrifos was quite toxic within 24 h to both G. ashmeadi and A. melinus. Future tests will measure the amounts of imidacloprid and thiamethoxam that are on the surface of citrus leaves affecting the survival of the parasitoids using ELISA. Based on these findings, our research will focus on understanding which chemicals are the most beneficial for maintaining a minimal impact on important parasitoids on citrus and grapes...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} {{compounds}} representing four major pesticide groups were tested for toxicity to beneficial insects representing four different insect orders: Coleoptera (Coccinellidae), Hemiptera (Anthocoridae), Hymenoptera (Aphelinidae), and Neuroptera (Chrysopidae). These materials included organophosphates (methidathion, esfenvalerate and phosmet), carbamates (carbofuran, methomyl and carbaryl), pyrethroids (bifenthrin, <b>fenpropathrin,</b> zeta-cypermethrin, cyfluthrin and permethrin) and the oxadiazine indoxacarb. Toxicity to coccinellid and lacewing species {{was assessed by}} treating 1 st instar larvae with the recommended field rate of commercial products, and two 10 fold dilutions of these materials, in topical spray applications. Adult Aphytis melinus Debach and 2 nd instar Orius insidiosus (Say) were exposed to leaf residues of the same concentrations for 24 h. ANOVA performed on composite survival indices derived from these data resolved significant differences among materials {{with respect to their}} overall toxicity to beneficial insects. Cyfluthrin, <b>fenpropathrin</b> and zeta-cypermethrin all increased the developmental time of the lacewing and one or more coccinellid species for larvae that survived topical applications. Bifenthrin increased developmental time for two coccinellid species and decreased it in a third. Indoxacarb (Avaunt® WG, DuPont Corp.) ranked highest overall for safety to beneficial insects, largely because of its low dermal toxicity to all species tested. Zeta-cypermethrin (Super Fury®, FMC Corporation) received the second best safety rating, largely because of its low toxicity as a leaf residue to A. melinus and O. insidiosus. Phosmet (Imidan® 70 W, Gowan Co.) and methidathion (Supracide® 25 W, Gowan Co.) ranked high for safety to coccinellid species, but compounds currently recommended for use in citrus such as <b>fenpropathrin</b> (Danitol® 2. 4 EC, Sumimoto Chem. Co.) and carbaryl (Sevin® XLR EC, Rhone Poulenc Ag. Co.) ranked very low for IPM-compatibility based on their relatively high toxicity to all species tested...|$|E
40|$|Pollination has an {{important}} role in both agricultural production and wild plant reproduction. For the pollination of crops, agriculture relies largely on managed colonies of the honeybee Apis mellifera. Worker bees are primarily affected by pesticides. The symptoms of poisoning vary depending on the developmental stage of the individual bee and kind of chemical employed. The acute contact toxicity of insecticides (phosalone and pirimicarb), acaricide (propargite), insecticide and acaricide (<b>fenpropathrin),</b> fungicides and bactericides (copper oxychloride and bordeaux mixture) was assessed in Iran through laboratory experiments. The median lethal concentrations (LC 50 - 24 h, LC 50 - 48 h and LC 50 - 72 h) were evaluated {{for the purposes of this}} research. Results showed that <b>fenpropathrin</b> had high toxicity; LC 50 - 24 h, LC 50 - 48 h and LC 50 - 72 h were 5. 7, 3. 2 and 2. 9 ppm respectively. Additionally, the bordeaux mixture had the minimum contact toxicity on honeybees with LC 50 - 24 h, LC 50 - 48 h and LC 50 - 72 h being 79, 926; 69, 552 and 69, 045 ppm respectively and was safe and non-toxic in honeybees...|$|E
