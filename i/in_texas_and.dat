5|$|Population size {{is usually}} largest {{during the summer}} and declines during winter, {{although}} populations <b>in</b> <b>Texas</b> <b>and</b> Louisiana may be more seasonally stable.

In coastal Mississippi, storms probably do not cause the population to decline substantially, and in Texas, inundation of its habitat did not significantly influence population density. However, in Mississippi, flooding did cause a marked decline in rice rat abundance.|$|E
