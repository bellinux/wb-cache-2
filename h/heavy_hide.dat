60|$|For a {{while the}} man and woman busied {{themselves}} only with keeping {{out of the way of}} the two creatures, but finally I saw them separate and each creep stealthily toward one of the combatants.

60|$|It {{was short}} but terrible. We threw {{everything}} we could overboard, including the ballast stones {{at the bottom of}} the canoe and the <b>heavy</b> <b>hide</b> of the gorilla. This, as it proved, was fortunate, since the thing sank but slowly and the foremost Pongo boats halted a minute to recover so precious a relic, checking the others behind them, a circumstance that helped us by twenty or thirty yards.|$|E
25|$|If {{dark matter}} {{is made up}} of sub-atomic particles, then millions, {{possibly}} billions, of such particles must pass through every square centimeter of the Earth each second. Many experiments aim to test this hypothesis. Although WIMPs are popular search candidates, the Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX) searches for axions. Another candidate is <b>heavy</b> <b>hidden</b> sector particles that only interact with ordinary matter via gravity.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this letter, we {{consider}} {{a class of}} scenarios in which the dark matter {{is part of a}} <b>heavy</b> <b>hidden</b> sector that is thermally decoupled from the Standard Model in the early universe. The dark matter freezes-out by annihilating to a lighter, metastable state, whose subsequent abundance can naturally come to dominate the energy density of the universe. When this state decays, it reheats the visible sector and dilutes all relic abundances, thereby allowing the dark matter to be orders of magnitude heavier than the weak scale. For concreteness, {{we consider}} a simple realization with a Dirac fermion dark matter candidate coupled to a massive gauge boson that decays to the Standard Model through its kinetic mixing with hypercharge. We identify viable parameter space in which the dark matter can be as heavy as ∼ 1 – 100 PeV without being overproduced in the early universe...|$|R

Mina Purefoy swollen belly {{on a bed}} groaning {{to have a child}} tugged out of her. One born every second somewhere. Other dying every second. Since I fed the birds five minutes.

60|$|Thus {{they talked}} {{of these and}} other things amongst the hum of the great camp, which was like to that of bees on a lime-tree in summer, and whilst they talked the blue August sky became {{suddenly}} overcast.

5000|$|Chestnut wood is {{a useful}} source of natural tannin and was used for tanning leather before the {{introduction}} of synthetic tannins. On a 10% moisture basis, the bark contains 6.8% tannin and the wood 13.4%. The bark imparts a dark colour to the tannin, and has a higher sugar content, which increases the percentage of soluble non-tans, or impurities, in the extract; {{so it was not}} employed in this use. Chestnut tannin is obtained by hot-water extraction of chipped wood. It is an ellagic tannin and its main constituents are identified by castalagin (14.2%) and vescalagin (16.2%).It has a naturally low pH value, relatively low salts content, and high acids content. This determines its astringency and its capability to fix raw hides. These properties make chestnut extract especially suitable for the tanning of <b>heavy</b> <b>hides</b> and to produce leather soles for high-quality shoes in particular. It is possible to obtain a leather with high yield in weight, which is compact, firm, flexible, and waterproof. Chestnut-tanned leathers are elastic, lightfast, resistant to traction and abrasion, and have warm colour.Chestnut tannin is one of the pyrogallol class of tannins (also known as hydrolysable tannin). As it tends to give a brownish tone to the leather, it is most often used in combination with quebracho, mimosa, tara, myrabolans, and valonia. [...] The wood seems to reach its highest tannin content after the trees reach 30 years old. The southern European chestnut wood usually contains at least 10 to 13% more tannin than chestnut trees in northern climates.|$|R

40|$|The {{masses of}} the excited <b>heavy</b> tetraquarks with <b>hidden</b> charm are {{calculated}} within the relativistic diquark-antidiquark picture. The dynamics of the light quark in a heavy-light diquark is treated completely relativistically. The diquark structure is taken into account by calculating the diquark-gluon form factor. New experimental data on charmonium-like states above open charm threshold are discussed. The obtained results indicate that X(3872), Y(4260), Y(4360), Z(4248), Z(4433) and Y(4660) could be tetraquark states with hidden charm. Comment: 11 page...|$|R
50|$|In 1925 the Council of the League of Nations allowed Poland to keep 88 {{soldiers}} on Westerplatte, which the Poles had secretly increased to 176 men and six officers by September 1939.

50|$|Hawks then hired silent {{film star}} Richard Barthelmess {{for the role}} of Bat MacPherson.

25|$|The {{big guns}} {{opened fire on}} the New Madrid {{defensive}} positions on March 13, and continued throughout the day. McCown realized that Pope would try to attack his forts by regular approaches. He felt that his reduced artillery companies would be too exhausted to resist, so {{he decided not to}} wait for the inevitable. On the night of March 13–14, orders were given to abandon the town and its two forts. A <b>heavy</b> rainstorm <b>hid</b> the troop movements from the enemy, so the evacuation was accomplished without incident. There was some confusion (which seems to have been exaggerated in Pope's reports), and the departure was so sudden that the guns in the forts had to be spiked and left behind, but most of the troops were successfully removed and redistributed. On the morning of March 14, two deserters appeared bearing a white flag, and informed Pope that the town was deserted.|$|R
