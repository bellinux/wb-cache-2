40|$|A {{number of}} {{recurrent}} problems have plagued attempts to render political corruption amenable to academic study. The problem {{which is most}} readily tackled concerns the identification of those factors which are conducive to high rates of corruption. These factors may be discovered through analysis of historical periods during which corruption was apparently rife, or from investigation of contemporary conditions in the Third World, where high levels of corruption reputedly exist. Yet {{it may be that}} any such investigation is premature, for it presumes the existence of a shared agreement on what activities are to be classed as corrupt. Clearly no such consensus exists, {{for one of the most}} perennial problems of the study of political corruption centres around whether there is a fixed universally-applicable standard of public ethics, or whether the term “corruption” specifies different activities in different circumstances. It is here argued that corruption does not refer to a standardized set of activities, but is a term <b>imparting</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> moral condemnation to certain practices and different practices will be condemned in different cultural circumstances. Yet the debate is less clear-cut than this, for protagonists of each position have tended to adopt stances which are rather more inflexible and extreme than is warranted. In theory, the champions of the cultural relativity of corruption are certainly correct, but in practice they ignore the substantial similarity between conceptions of public ethics; a congruence which relegates most difference to those activities generally located on the fringes of public morality. A similar tendency to gravitate to extremes is to be found in the debate concerning the effects of corruption on the well-being of the political system, where those who hold that such effects must always be dysfunctional are in fundamental disagreement with those who perceive corruption as capable of conferring benefits upon the system in which it occurs. It is held here that no general law governs the relationship between corruption and its political effects, and whether the results of corruption are ultimately beneficial or dysfunctional must be determined in each separate instance. In theory then, the position of those who are here designated. as “functionalists" is closest to reality, though in accordance with the black/white syndrome which is also evident in this debate, they have grossly overestimated the degree to which it plays a positive role in political and economic development, Examination of the role played by corruption in violent physical change and, less dramatically, electoral change, further suggests the absence of any general rule concerning the political effect of corruption, though it is unlikely to ever be a prime mover of change. The fourth oft-discussed problem is the operational one of rendering political corruption amenable to comparative study. As it is here argued that corruption wears different clothes in different cultural circumstances, any attempt to find an objective standard of corruption is doomed to failure. Comparative analysis is not thereby rendered impossible, however, for the broad similarity between systems of public ethics means inter-cultural differences will be marginal rather than pivotal. To prepare the subject for analysis the ethical status of fringe activities must be first ascertained; an onerous task, but one much less laborious than those who have been moved to seek an objective standard of political corruption believe. To demonstrate how this task may be undertaken, two fringe activities in the Australian political context are examined. Finally, note is made of a number of problem areas in the study of political corruption which have not yet been accorded the attention which they deserve...|$|E

40|$|Quality {{assurance}} activities, {{in software}} development, are {{the backbone of}} whole project. These activities are not only responsible <b>of</b> product <b>quality,</b> but also for process quality. In conventional software development QA is a separate group of QA experts. As the trends of software development moved towards agile development, QA activities also got changed. In agile development most of these activities are performed by developers. Close people collaboration, onsite customer and Test Driven Development are the approaches in agile development to achieve better product quality. In this thesis we have presented the philosophical as well as practical angle QA in agile development. Mindset of agile development revolves around product quality but there is much {{work to be done}} to <b>impart</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> process in agile development to get it standardized and more organized. QA activities remain centric and focused to testing. Practices like SPI and following some standards are lacking in agile methodologies. In this thesis we have proposed to inject an extra layer of QA in agile projects.

2500|$|According to Dewey, the {{emphasis}} is placed on producing these attributes in children for use in their contemporary life because it is “impossible to foretell definitely just what civilization will be twenty years from now” (Dewey, MPC, 2010, p.25). [...] However, although Dewey is steadfast in his beliefs that education serves an immediate purpose (Dewey, DRT, 2010; Dewey, MPC, 2010; Dewey, TTP, 2010), he is not ignorant of the impact <b>imparting</b> these <b>qualities</b> <b>of</b> intelligence, skill and character on young children in their present life will have on the future society. [...] While addressing the state of educative and economic affairs during a 1935 radio broadcast, Dewey linked the ensuing economic depression to a “lack of sufficient production of intelligence, skill and character” (Dewey, TAP, 2010, p.242) of the nation’s workforce. [...] As Dewey notes, {{there is a lack of}} these goods in the present society and teachers have a responsibility to create them in their students, who, we can assume, will grow into the adults who will ultimately go on to participate in whatever industrial or economical civilization awaits them. [...] According to Dewey, the profession of the classroom teacher is to produce the intelligence, skill and character within each student so that the democratic community is composed of citizens who can think, do and act intelligently and morally.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the educational institution that is producing good results in their academic exams {{can be achieved by}} using the data mining techniques which can be applied to predict the performance of the students and to <b>impart</b> the <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> education in the educational institutions. Data mining is used to extract meaningful information and to develop relationships among variables stored in large data set. In this paper, Apriori algorithm is used which extracts the set of rules, specific to each class and analyzes the given data to classify the student based on their performance in academics. Students are classified based on their involvement in doing assignment, internal assessment tests, attendance etc., which helps to predict the performance of the student based on the pattern extracted from the educational database. This would help to identify the average and below average students and to improve their performance to provide good results. This analysis further helps matching organization„s requirement with students profile to provide placement for the students. Also, the interestingness of a rule is measured using lift in itself and as a part in formulae. The range of values that lift may take is used to normalize lift so that it is more effective as a measure of interestingness. This standardization is extended to account for minimum support and confidence thresholds...|$|R
40|$|Allergic {{rhinitis}} (AR) symptoms can <b>impart</b> emotional, <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> life (QOL), {{and work}} productivity burdens, especially in persistent AR (PER). Desloratadine, an H 1 -receptor antagonist, {{has been shown}} to be effective against nasal and nonnasal AR symptoms and to improve QOL. Exploratory analyses were conducted to evaluate whether desloratadine-mediated symptom improvement correlated with improvements in QOL and productivity. The Aerius Control: Clinical and Evaluative Profile of Treatment 2 (NCT 00405964) study was a 12 -week, multinational, randomized, placebo-controlled prospective study of once-daily desloratadine at 5 mg in subjects with moderate-to-severe PER. Assessments included twice-daily symptom severity ratings (0 = none to 3 = severe; total and individual symptoms), sleep interference (morning [A. M. ]), interference with activities of daily living (ADL; evening [P. M. ]), the Rhinoconjunctivitis <b>Quality</b> <b>of</b> Life Questionnaire-Standardized version (baseline and days 29 and 85), and the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment-Allergy-Specific questionnaire (baseline and weekly). Pearson product-moment correlation statistics (r) were determined to assess correlations between symptom score improvements and QOL factors. All desloratadine-treated patients (n = 360) were included in this exploratory analysis. In the desloratadine-treated patients, all correlations tested were positive (all p < 0. 0001). The highest coefficients were seen for the correlations between A. M. /P. M. PRIOR total five-symptom score and interference with ADL (r = 0. 72) and between A. M.
