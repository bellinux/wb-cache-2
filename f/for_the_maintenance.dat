It may include greenhouses, test grounds, an herbarium, an arboretum, and other departments.

5|$|A {{controversial}} plan, {{known as}} the Major Moves plan, was passed in 2006. The Indiana Toll Road was leased to Statewide Mobility Partners, a joint venture company owned by Spanish firm Cintra and Australia's Macquarie Infrastructure Group for 75 years {{in exchange for a}} one time payment of $3.85 billion. The measure was opposed by most Democrats, who began an advertising campaign accusing Daniels of selling the road to foreign nations. The income from the lease was used to finance a backlog of public transportation projects and create a $500 million trust fund to generate revenue <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> of the highway system.|$|E

The depot assembled and tested new aircraft, and ferried them to operational areas such as northern Australia and New Guinea. It was also responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>maintenance</b> of in-service aircraft, including their engines, instruments, and armament. As well as RAAF equipment, No.1 AD repaired battle-damaged US aircraft such as B-17 Flying Fortresses.|$|E
