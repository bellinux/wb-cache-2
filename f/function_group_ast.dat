40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} astragalosides (AST) and Panax notoginseng saponins (PNS) combination on oxidative stress of brain tissues in C 57 BL/ 6 mice with cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury. Methods: Eighty C 57 BL/ 6 mice were randomly divided into sham-operated group, untreated group, high-dose combination <b>group</b> (<b>AST</b> at a dose of 220 mg/kg plus PNS at a dose of 230 mg/kg), medium-dose combination <b>group</b> (<b>AST</b> at a dose of 110 mg/kg plus PNS at a dose of 115 mg/kg), low-dose combination <b>group</b> (<b>AST</b> at a dose of 55 mg/kg plus PNS at a dose of 57. 5 mg/kg), <b>AST</b> (110 mg/kg) <b>group,</b> PNS (115 mg/kg) group and edaravone (4 mg/kg) <b>group.</b> <b>AST</b> and PNS were administered by gavage once daily for 4 days and edaravone was administered by intraperitoneal injection twice daily for 4 days. On the fourth day, bilateral common carotid arteries were ligated for 20 minutes to induce cerebral ischemia, followed by 60 minutes of reperfusion. Ischemic brain tissue was used to prepare tissue homogenate, then contents of malonaldehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) and nitric oxide (NO), and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in the homogenate were detected. Two×two analysis of variance of factorial design was used to analyze whether there was an interaction between AST at 110 mg/kg and PNS at 115 mg/kg. Results: Compared with sham-operated group, contents of MDA and NO, and activity of NOS in the untreated group were remarkably increased (P＜ 0. 01), activity of SOD and content of GSH were decreased (P＜ 0. 01). Compared with the untreated group, content of MDA in the <b>AST</b> <b>group</b> was decreased (P＜ 0. 01) and activity of SOD was increased (P＜ 0. 01), however, contents of GSH and NO and activity of NOS had no obvious changes (P> 0. 05). Contents of MDA and NO in the PNS group was decreased {{as compared with the}} untreated group (P＜ 0. 01), but activities of SOD and NOS and content of GSH had no changes (P> 0. 05). Contents of MDA and NO and activity of NOS in brain tissues in the edaravone group were decreased (P＜ 0. 01, P＜ 0. 05), and activity of SOD was increased (P＜ 0. 05), while content of GSH had no changes (P> 0. 05). Contents of MDA and NO and activity of NOS in brain tissue in the AST and PNS combination groups were decreased (P＜ 0. 01, P< 0. 05), the activity of SOD increased (P＜ 0. 01, P＜ 0. 05), the content of GSH increased (P＜ 0. 01, P< 0. 05), and activity of SOD and content of GSH were increased (P< 0. 01, P＜ 0. 05). The results of analysis of variance of factorial design showed that there were interactions between AST (110 mg/kg) and PNS (115 mg/kg) (P＜ 0. 01). Conclusion: Combination of AST (110 mg/kg) and PNS (115 mg/kg) has a restraint effect on the early oxidative stress injury in the brain after ischemia-reperfusion, and the combination has a synergistic or additive effect...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the preventive effectiveness of dry cow therapy based on antibiotic, internal teat sealant, and α-tocopherol administered separately or in various combinations at drying-off The study was performed on 322 uninfected quarters of 95 cows originating from three dairy herds. The new intramammary infection rates after calving were measured to evaluate the effectiveness. The quarters were divided into six groups differing in treatment, namely: control group (group C, n = 40) and five treatment groups. Treatment groups were arranged as follows: group A (antibiotic alone, n = 81), group AS (antibiotic + sealant, n = 40), <b>group</b> <b>AST</b> (antibiotic + sealant + α-tocopherol, n = 40), group T (α-tocopherol alone, n = 40), group S (sealant alone, n = 81). New infection rate amounted to 47. 5 % in group C. The treatment in <b>group</b> <b>AST</b> significantly prevented from the occurrence of new intramammary infections (12. 5 %, P 0. 05), although the use of the sealant alone (group S) decreased the risk of new infection (24. 7 %, P 0. 05). Increased α-tocopherol level (P < 0. 05) was detected after calving in the quarters from cows that received α-tocopherol injections. In conclusion, the combination of antibiotic, internal teat sealant, and α-tocopherol used in dry cow therapy showed a significantly better preventive effect against new intramammary infections, than the therapeutics administered separately...|$|R

40|$|Mechanism of oral {{absorbent}} AST- 120 in lipid abnormalities {{in experimental}} uremic ratsBackgroundWe {{have reported that}} oral sorbent AST- 120 (AST) is effective in delaying the induction of dialysis in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) because of its effect on lipid metabolism. To clarify the precise mechanism of AST in lipid abnormalities in CRF, we examined the effect of AST on plasma lipid profile, total bile acids (TBA), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in experimental uremic rats. MethodsUremic rats were prepared using male Wistar rats by ligating 5 / 6 of the renal artery. Uremic rats were randomly {{divided into two groups}} as follows: a control group in which rats were maintained on the standard diet and an <b>AST</b> <b>group</b> in which rats were maintained on a diet containing 5 g of AST per 100 g of standard diet for 10 weeks. Plasma LPL activity was measured as free fatty acid (FFA) generation after intravenous administration of heparin. ResultsPlasma creatinine at 1. 5 ± 0. 1 mg/dl was lower in the <b>AST</b> <b>group</b> than the 1. 9 ± 0. 5 mg/ml level in the control <b>group.</b> <b>AST</b> significantly decreased plasma total cholesterol from 192 ± 29 to 142 ± 25 mg/dl, triglycerides from 198 ± 71 to 99 ± 38 mg/dl, and TBA from 19. 6 ± 2. 6 μmol/liter to 8. 8 ± 3. 5 μmol/ml. Plasma LPL activity at 0. 22 ± 0. 01 μmol FFA/min/hr was significantly higher in the <b>AST</b> <b>group</b> than 0. 15 ± 0. 03 μmol FFA/min/hr in the control group. ConclusionsThese results suggest that AST may improve plasma lipid abnormalities by binding to bile acids in the intestinal lumen and preventing their reabsorption and inhibiting the reduction of LPL activity in experimental uremic rats...|$|R

40|$|To {{separate}} functional from phylogenetic pelvic {{differences in}} Aves, seventy-seven birds were measured and statistically analyzed {{to define the}} characters that unite them into <b>function</b> <b>groups,</b> and to identify the characters that separate the <b>function</b> <b>groups</b> from each other. Four Major <b>Function</b> <b>Groups</b> were identified: Birds of Prey (Chapter II) Waterbirds (Chapter III), Ground birds and Stalker-wader birds (Chapter V). Birds of Prey statistically separate into Air predators and Scavengers. Waterbirds statistically divide into Surface swimmers, Wing-propelled divers, and Foot-propelled divers. A suite of pelvic characters (Level One indicators) can separate nonpasseriformes birds into <b>function</b> <b>groups.</b> These are: length to width ratio of the pelvis, iliac angle, relative iliac surface areas and pre-acetabular ilium proportions. A second suite of characters (Level Two indicators), used by themselves, shows trends, but do not completely separate the <b>function</b> <b>groups.</b> These are proportional length of lower leg components, and femur length: pelvis length ratio. Combining the identified characters in Principal Component Analysis and Discriminant Function Analysis produces a good split among the <b>function</b> <b>groups.</b> When all of the birds are combined into a single analysis (Chapter V), using Level one and Level Two characters, the plots generated have Stalker-wader birds at the center, with three groups radiating out. One arm is Ground Birds, another is Waterbirds, {{and the third is}} Birds of Prey. ^ Pelvic musculature dissections of a representative from each group are compared (Chapter VI). The picture drawn from the muscle data is different. The muscle data suggest that Ground Birds are the central group. Ground Birds (represented by a pigeon) have leg/pelvic muscles neither specialized for specific femoral movements, nor for specific tibiotarsal movements. No particular group of muscles is hypertrophied, and no major groups are reduced or missing. The other three <b>function</b> <b>groups</b> of birds show some degree of specialization, either by reducing or accentuating muscles, or by losing muscles completely. The result is a statistical portrait of four bird <b>function</b> <b>groups</b> that has implications for the sequence of morphological changes seen in avian radiations of the Tertiary. ...|$|R

40|$|Background : {{physical}} activity can cause oxidative stress and tissue damage. Lier {{is an important}} organ that has many functions. Physical activity reduces blood perfusion to the liver and can damage liver cells. Consuming exogenous antioxidants {{is one way to}} prevent cell damage from oxidative stress. Purple sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) is one source of antioxidants due to the high content of antosianin. Fermentation can increase the stability of antioxidants. Aim : To investigate the effect of fermented purple sweet potato extracts (Ipomoea batatas L.) with AST and ALT levels in blood after maximal {{physical activity}} Methods : This study uses a true experimental design with post test only control group design in male rats. The research uses 24 samples of rats with 4 different treatments.
