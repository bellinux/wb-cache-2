5|$|As {{the revolt}} and raids were {{occurring}} in Campania, {{which was a}} vacation region {{of the rich and}} influential <b>in</b> <b>Rome,</b> <b>and</b> the location of many estates, the revolt quickly {{came to the attention of}} Roman authorities.

5|$|After Celestine's death Theobald {{returned}} to England, stopping at St Denis Abbey in Paris to help Suger, the abbot, consecrate the newly rebuilt abbey church and its altars. Theobald {{was the only}} bishop present at the ceremony whose diocese was not in France. Meanwhile, Henry of Blois had arrived <b>in</b> <b>Rome</b> <b>and</b> begun negotiations with the new pope, Lucius II, over the elevation of the bishopric of Winchester to an archbishopric. It appears that Lucius appointed a legate, Cardinal Icmar, the Bishop of Tusculum, to travel to England and oversee the project, but Lucius died before anything was accomplished.|$|E

5|$|Clement {{worked to}} {{decrease}} the influence of Spanish cardinals in the College of Cardinals. He created five French cardinals, and the Italian cardinals he created were considered neutral. Clement wanted the French cardinals that he created to be present <b>in</b> <b>Rome</b> <b>and</b> {{to take part in}} the governance of the Church. Henry IV also demanded that three French cardinals go to Rome, and they were present at Clement's death on 3 March 1605.|$|E
5|$|Colen Campbell was {{influenced}} by the Palladian style and has been credited with founding Georgian architecture. Architectural historian Howard Colvin has speculated that he was associated with James Smith and that Campbell may even have been his pupil. He spent most of his career in Italy and England and developed a rivalry with fellow Scot James Gibbs. Gibbs trained <b>in</b> <b>Rome</b> <b>and</b> also practised mainly in England. His architectural style did incorporate Palladian elements, as well as forms from Italian baroque and Inigo Jones, but was most strongly influenced by the interpretation of the Baroque by Sir Christopher Wren.|$|E

5|$|Despite republicanism in Greece, Olga {{was still}} held in high esteem {{and the republican}} {{government}} in Athens offered {{to pay for her}} funeral and repatriate her remains to Greece. Nonetheless, her children declined the offer, preferring to bury her in Italy beside her son, Constantine I, whose body Greece had refused to accept. Her funeral was held on 22 June 1926 at the Orthodox Church <b>in</b> <b>Rome</b> <b>and</b> the next day she was laid to rest in the crypt of the Russian church in Florence. After the restoration of the Greek monarchy in 1935 she was re-interred at Tatoi on 17 November 1936.|$|E
5|$|During Tiberius' reign Jews {{had become}} more {{prominent}} <b>in</b> <b>Rome</b> <b>and</b> Jewish and Gentile followers of Jesus began proselytizing Roman citizens, increasing long-simmering resentments. Tiberius in 19 AD ordered Jews who were of military age to join the Roman Army. Tiberius banished {{the rest of the}} Jews from Rome and threatened to enslave them for life if they did not leave the city.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{the trophy}} {{was held by}} 1938 winners Italy. Ottorino Barassi, the Italian {{vice-president}} of FIFA and president of FIGC, secretly transported the trophy from a bank <b>in</b> <b>Rome</b> <b>and</b> hid it in a shoe-box under his bed to prevent Adolf Hitler and the Nazis from taking it. The 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden {{marked the beginning of}} a tradition regarding the trophy. As Brazilian captain Hilderaldo Bellini heard photographer requests for a better view of the Jules Rimet Trophy, he lifted it up in the air. Every Cup-winning captain ever since has repeated the gesture.|$|E

5|$|During {{the reign}} of Boris I (r. 852–889) Bulgaria {{underwent}} major changes— the Christianization {{of the country and}} the admission of the disciples of Saints Cyril and Methodius, which {{marked the beginning of the}} creation and consolidation of the medieval Bulgarian literature and alphabet. Following intense negotiations with the Papacy <b>in</b> <b>Rome</b> <b>and</b> the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, Bulgaria converted to Eastern Orthodox Christianity, which caused discontent among part of the nobility who directly associated the new religion with the Byzantine Empire and feared that the country would fall under Byzantine influence.|$|E

5|$|Heston and Boyd {{both had}} to learn how to drive a chariot.

5|$|Historian Michael Crawford {{attributes}} {{the disappearance of}} much of Tiberius Gracchus' support to the reduced level of citizen participation due to dispersal far from Rome, and sees his tribunate as marking {{a step in the}} Hellenization of Roman aristocracy. Crawford asserts that Gaius Gracchus' extortion law shifted the balance of power <b>in</b> <b>Rome</b> <b>and</b> that the Gracchi made available a new political armoury which the oligarchy subsequently sought to exploit.|$|E
5|$|Hitler took a {{personal}} interest in architecture and worked closely with state architects Paul Troost and Albert Speer to create public buildings in a neoclassical style based on Roman architecture. Speer constructed imposing structures such as the Nazi party rally grounds in Nuremberg and a new Reich Chancellery building in Berlin. Hitler's plans for rebuilding Berlin included a gigantic dome based on the Pantheon <b>in</b> <b>Rome</b> <b>and</b> a triumphal arch {{more than double the}} height of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Neither structure was built.|$|E

5|$|It is {{difficult}} {{to determine the extent to}} which the events of this war contributed to changes in the use and legal rights of Roman slaves. The end of the Servile Wars seems to have coincided with the end of the period of the most prominent use of slaves <b>in</b> <b>Rome</b> <b>and</b> the beginning of a new perception of slaves within Roman society and law. The Third Servile War was the last of the Servile Wars, and Rome did not see another slave uprising of this magnitude again.|$|E
5|$|Octavian also {{demanded that}} the decree should be {{rescinded}} which declared Antony a public enemy. When this was refused, he marched on the city with eight legions.

Meanwhile, Antony formed an alliance with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, another leading Caesarian.|$|E
