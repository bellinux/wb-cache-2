5000|$|Fine {{blanking}} presses {{are similar}} to other metal stamping presses, {{but they have a}} few critical additional parts. A typical compound fine blanking press includes a hardened <b>die</b> <b>punch</b> (male), the hardened blanking die (female), and a guide plate of similar shape/size to the blanking die. The guide plate is the first applied to the material, impinging the material with a sharp protrusion or stinger {{around the perimeter of the}} die opening. Next a counter pressure is applied opposite the punch, and finally the <b>die</b> <b>punch</b> forces the material through the die opening. Since the guide plate holds the material so tightly, and since the counter pressure is applied, the material is cut in a manner more like extrusion than typical punching. Mechanical properties of the cut benefit similarly with a hardened layer at the cut edge of the part. [...] Because the material is so tightly held and controlled in this setup, part flatness remains very true, distortion is nearly eliminated, and edge burr is minimal. Clearances between the die and punch are generally around 1% of the cut material thickness, which typically varies between 0.5 - 13 mm. Currently parts as thick as 19 mm can be cut using fine blanking. Tolerances between ±0.0003 - 0.002 in are possible, depending on base material thickness and tensile strength, and part layout.|$|E

The experiment was performed on sheet metal using various <b>die</b> and <b>punch</b> radius values while their springback behavior was observed. The design of experiment approach was used in these experiments using the full factorial and analysis of variance methods to identify whether or not the <b>die</b> and <b>punch</b> radii are significant input parameters in predicting springback. From the statistical analysis, it shows that the <b>die</b> and <b>punch</b> radius parameters are significant factors contributing to the springback effect in the V-die bending of stainless steel sheet metal at the significance level of 0. 05 because their p-value is less than 0. 05. The results from the experiments showed that springback is affected by the <b>die</b> and <b>punch</b> radius values in the air V-bending experiments. From this analysis, it can be concluded that the springback values can be decreased by decreasing the values of the <b>die</b> and <b>punch</b> radii.

The plasma nitriding is performed to increase the surface properties like –wear resistance and surface hardness of these components. After plasma nitriding the surface hardness of these materials has increased typically from ~ 500 HV 0. 01 to ~ 1200 HV 0. 01. In the plasma nitriding process high-voltage electrical energy is used to form plasma through which nitrogen ions are accelerated to impinge on the workpiece. The ion bombardment heats the workpiece, cleans the surface, and provides active nitrogen to make iron-nitride compounds. The iron-nitride compounds then diffuse to the workspace to harden the surface. In these two service conditions the plasma nitrided hot-forging <b>dies</b> and <b>punches</b> have shown typically 2. 5 to 4 times increment during the performance. It is observed that the increment in the performance of the <b>dies</b> and <b>punches</b> depends on the forging service conditions, i. e., temperature of the <b>dies</b> and <b>punches,</b> shot repetition time and effective cooling of <b>dies</b> and <b>punches</b> in service conditions.

To meet these challenges combined extrusion-forging process is employed to achieve improved material properties, high production rates, and less material wastage when compared with other manufacturing processes such as machining, casting, etc. Combined extrusion-forging process is the advanced metal forming process in which an initial billet is forced through the extrusion and forging <b>die</b> <b>punch</b> setup to get desired product. The flow pattern of metal mainly depends on the frictional conditions at the workpiece/die interface, the geometry of dies and the percentage area reductions.

40|$|BACKGROUND The aim of {{the study}} is to categorically suggest the apt method of {{surgical}} technique for a particular type of distal radius fracture (Frykman’s type III-VI). Distal radius fracture are among the most common fractures of the upper extremity inspite of increased focus on regular prevention of osteoporosis, early identification and its prompt management. Most distal radius fractures are the result of low energy mechanisms that can be successfully treated either nonoperatively or with a variety of operative techniques if indicated. Complex distal radius fractures occur most commonly in high-energy injuries with extensive comminution or bone loss and associated soft tissue or vascular injuries. These high-energy fractures can present challenges in reconstructing the distal radius. Effective restoration of the bony architecture requires a thorough knowledge of distal radius anatomy, understanding of the goals of treatment, versatility in surgical approaches and familiarity with multiple fixation options. Although, majority of the extra-articular fracture without signs of instability can be successfully managed with POP immobilisation for a period of 4 - 5 weeks followed by active physiotherapy, other types (Frykman’s III-VI) need surgical management that too with combination of surgical techniques namely augmented spanning external fixator with supplemented K-wire fixation or external fixation followed by fragment specific volar locking compression plate osteosynthesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS I have studied 50 cases of distal radius fractures classified using Frykman’s classification using combination of techniques namely augmented spanning external fixator application with K-wire supplementation and spanning external fixator application followed by volar LCP fixation in which external fixator had been used as a reduction tool in majority of the cases and external fixator had been removed after plate osteosynthesis. In some cases retained for a period of 4 - 6 weeks after plate osteosynthesis, which is followed by bone grafting. By early removal of external fixator, fixator-related issues like muscle tendon and nerve impalement, pin tract infection at the site of pin insertion can be minimised. RESULTS Outcome is determined by multiple factors and depends greatly on the soft tissue injury, patient factors and management and the adequacy of restoration of osseous and ligamentous relationships. In contrary to prolonged use of augmented spanning external fixator, which resulted in stiffness of wrist and finger, pin tract infection in both groups (whether external fixator application followed by K-wire fixation as well as external fixator application followed by volar plate osteosynthesis) external fixator can be removed at the end of 4 weeks while K-wires are still in place. Patient can be encouraged to move their fingers and wrist, allowed them to do minimal daily activities. With the use of external fixation in combination protocol radial length has been achieved by ligamentotaxis in majority of the cases (except in <b>die</b> <b>punch</b> intra-articular fracture) and in spite of ground-glass comminution - good reduction is always almost possible. In highly impacted intra-articular <b>die</b> <b>punch</b> fracture-variant arthroscopy-assisted reduction followed by K-wire fixation and further maintained on external fixation. Need for bone grafting was almost negligible unless there was evidence of segmental bone loss from day 1. As in one case (open fracture) where external fixator was applied in order to maintain length of distal radius and soft tissues healing followed by bone grafting and VLCP fixation. CONCLUSION Finally, combination techniques instead of single technique offers various advantages in the management of complex comminuted fracture distal radius both in closed and open fractures. ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Afrikaans and Dutch)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. There {{are certain}} issues - such as violence, sexuality, {{politics}} and religion - which are problematic but {{have to be}} dealt with in society. In this dissertation types of controversial issues present in recent Afrikaans youth literature, the portrayal of those issues, and the ways in which solutions are offered for these issues are investigated. The argument follows from the assumption that the literature which the adolescent reads, has a directive value. Quite often the reader will choose to read material about a certain situation with which the reader is also faced in real life. It may be easy for the reader to identify with a character in similar circumstances or facing the same dilemma. Through the actions of the character, the reader can then explore certain avenues or possibilities which have the potential to be helpful in the solution of the problem or issue. For this dissertation research was done about certain controversial issues and related aspects in literature in general, which are then applied to three youth novels: Skilpoppe (1998) by Barrie Hough, Daar's vis in <b>die</b> <b>punch</b> (2002) by Jackie Nagtegaal and Nie vir kinders nie (2005) by Francois Bloemhof. These three texts were chosen because all three of them have generated public discussion, specifically in the media, about the presence of controversial issues. The results indicate the portrayal of the controversial issues to be unbiased and from a non-judgemental authoring perspective. The presence of the text internal corrective, which refers to the portrayal of a certain issue thereby giving it an outcome (positive or negative) or an alternative, is noticeable and is discussed in this dissertation.

40|$|International audienceThis article {{presents}} an {{experimental study of}} the effects of raised ambient temperature in <b>dies</b> and <b>punches</b> on the compaction of pharmaceutical powders. The experiments use an instrumented hydraulic press having a temperature-controlled enclosure allowing the ambient temperature of <b>die</b> and <b>punch</b> to be varied from 20 to 57 degrees C. A pharmaceutical powder was compacted at temperatures in this range and mechanical parameters, such as stress transfer ratio, stress transmission ratio, and die-wall friction, were analysed {{to examine the effects of}} heat transfer between tools and powder. In particular, it is shown that increasing the environmental temperature of <b>die</b> and <b>punch</b> increases the transfer ratio and the die-wall friction. The radial pressure is also slightly increased at the first stages of the compaction. However, the stress transmission is reduced by increasing the temperature. This may indicate an increase of shear stress. It is also observed that the particles undergoing compaction are `softened' by increase of the temperature. This softening is certainly due to rise in temperature of the powder generated by the compaction and by the heat flux transfer between the die and the tablet. It is suggested that these effects could be important in industrial tablet production installations without air conditioning and thus subject to variations in ambient temperature...|$|R
