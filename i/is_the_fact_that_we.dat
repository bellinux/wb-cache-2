Mark Perryman wrote in 2006: [...] "How could we expect to beat mighty (West) Germany, who had only narrowly lost the final four years previously? To my mind it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> so nearly did, then lost in the penalty shoot-out that explains the past 16 years of an increasingly bitter rivalry." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{problem of}} free will has been {{identified}} in ancient Greek philosophical literature. The notion of compatibilist free will {{has been attributed to}} both Aristotle (fourth century BCE) and Epictetus (1st century CE); [...] "it was the fact that nothing hindered us from doing or choosing something that made us have control over them". According to Susanne Bobzien, the notion of incompatibilist free will is perhaps first identified in the works of Alexander of Aphrodisias (third century CE); [...] "what makes us have control over things <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are causally undetermined in our decision and thus can freely decide between doing/choosing or not doing/choosing them".|$|E

60|$|Already in Bede's {{time the}} Wantsum was {{beginning}} to get silted up, mainly by the muddy deposits brought down by the Stour. It was then only three furlongs wide, and could be forded at two points, near Sarr and at Wade. The seaward mouth was also beginning to be encumbered with sand, and the first indication we get of this important impending change <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> now hear less of Richborough, and more of Sandwich, the new port a little nearer the sea, whose very name of the Wick or haven on the Sand, in itself sufficiently tells the history of its origin. As the older port got progressively silted up, the newer one grew into ever greater importance, exactly as Norwich ousted Caister, or as Portsmouth has taken the place of Porchester. Nevertheless, the central channel still remained navigable for the vessels of that age--they can only have drawn a very few feet of water--and this made the Wantsum in time the great highway for the Danish pirates on their way to London, and exposed Thanet exceptionally to their relentless incursions.|$|E

"The great {{vision of}} the glory that shall be, not in one sudden millennium, but slowly {{advancing}} toward joys of life which we can no more prevision than the aboriginal medicine-man could imagine the X-ray! I wish that this were {{the time and the}} place to rhapsodize about that vision, as William Morris has done, in News from Nowhere. You tell me that the various brands of socialists differ so much in their beliefs about this future that the bewildered layman can make nothing at all of their theories. Very well. They differ so much {{because there are so many}} different things we can do with this human race.... The defeat of death; the life period advancing to ten-score years all crowded with happy activity. The solution of labor's problem; increasing safety and decreasing hours of toil, and a way out for the unhappy consumer who is ground between labor and capital. A real democracy and the love of work that shall come when work is not relegated to wage-slaves, but joyously shared in a community inclusive of the living beings of all nations. France and Germany uniting precisely as Saxony and Prussia and Bavaria have united. And, most of all, a general realization that the fact that we cannot accomplish all these things at once does not indicate that they are hopeless; an understanding that one of the wonders of the future <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> shall always, in all ages, have improvements to look forward to.|$|E

50|$|There are now courses in, {{and even}} centres of visual {{anthropology}} at several universities in Europe.

5000|$|One of the {{greatest}} dangers of self diagnosis in psychological syndromes, is that you may miss a medical disease that masquerades as a psychiatric syndrome. Self-diagnosis also undermines {{the role of the}} doctor-which is not the best way to start the relationship. Then there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can know and see ourselves, but sometimes, we need a mirror to see ourselves more clearly. By self-diagnosing, you may be missing something that you cannot see. Another danger of self diagnosis is that you may think that there is more wrong with you than there actually is. Self-diagnosis is also a problem when you {{are in a state of}} denial about your symptoms.|$|E
50|$|During Carlton's 150th {{anniversary celebration}} in June 2014, {{at which he}} was named the club's {{greatest}} player, Nicholls went further, saying that the club needed to lose its arrogant image:But I must say, if I have one regret about the image of Carlton, who I love, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have probably taken over from Collingwood as being the most hated side in the league. I say that because people think we were arrogant, which we were - thanks {{to a couple of}} presidents. Without mentioning any names, they were arrogant. When we won, they didn’t know how to win properly. I believe that’s the thing about sport - you have got to know how to win and how to lose and do both properly. We were arrogant. I think that helped create an image of the club, being an arrogant club, which I don’t think we are.|$|E
5000|$|According to the theory, propositions can [...] "picture" [...] {{the world}} as being a certain way, and thus {{accurately}} represent it either truly or falsely. If someone thinks the proposition, [...] "There is a tree in the yard," [...] then that proposition accurately pictures the world {{if and only if}} there is a tree in the yard. One aspect of pictures which Wittgenstein finds particularly illuminating in comparison with language <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can directly see in the picture what situation it depicts without knowing if the situation actually obtains. This allows Wittgenstein to explain how false propositions can have meaning (a problem which Russell struggled with for many years): just as we can see directly from the picture the situation which it depicts without knowing if it in fact obtains, analogously, when we understand a proposition we grasp its truth conditions or its sense, that is, we know what the world must be like if it is true, without knowing if it is in fact true (TLP 4.024, 4.431).|$|E
