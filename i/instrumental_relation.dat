40|$|Using spinally transected rats, {{research}} has shown that neurons within the L 4 -S 2 spinal cord are sensitive to response-outcome (<b>instrumental)</b> <b>relations.</b> This learning depends on a form of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) –mediated plasticity. Instrumental training enables subsequent learning, and this effect has been linked to the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Rats given uncontrollable stimulation later exhibit impaired instrumental learning, and this deficit lasts up to 48 hr. The induction of the deficit can be blocked by prior training with controllable shock, the concurrent presentation of a tonic stimulus that induces antinociception, or pretreatment with an NMDA or gammaaminobutyric acid–A antagonist. The expression of the deficit depends on a kappa opioid. Uncontrollable stimulation enhances mechanical reactivity (allodynia), and treatments that induce allodynia (e. g., inflammation) inhibit learning. In intact animals, descending serotonergic neurons exert a protective effect that blocks the adverse consequences of uncontrollable stimulation.

40|$|According to Veritism, true {{belief is}} the sole {{fundamental}} epistemic value. Epistemologists often take Veritism to entail that all other epistemic items can only have value by standing in certain instrumental relations—viz., by tending to produce a high ratio of true to false beliefs or by being products of sources with this tendency. Yet many value theorists outside epistemology deny that all derivative value is grounded in <b>instrumental</b> <b>relations</b> to fundamental value (`Instrumentalism').

But this problem undermines Instrumentalism, not Veritism: granting Instrumentalism, similar problems arise for any economical epistemic axiology.

This commitment of ethical responsibility to the environment functions as a limit to any merely <b>instrumental</b> <b>relation</b> with our planet {{at the service of}} any empirical interests of human self-affirmation, and is deployed in two directions: on the one hand, as a relation of the right of mankind to the rational use of the environment which is to be translated into global public legislation on the private use of things, and, on the other hand, as a virtuous relationship of the individual with him or herself in which one’s own moral nature is established through the non-destructive treatment of inanimate and living beings in nature. En este trabajo se presenta la ética de Kant como un programa práctico de responsabilidad con la naturaleza fundado en la exigencia normativa de realización mundana de los seres humanos como personas morales. Ese compromiso de responsabilidad ética con el medio ambiente funciona como límite de toda relación meramente instrumental con nuestro planeta al servicio de cualesquiera intereses empíricos de autoafirmación humana, y se despliega en una doble dirección: por un lado, como una relación de derecho del hombre a la utilización racional del entorno que ha de traducirse en una legislación pública global sobre el uso privado de las cosas; y, por otro lado, como una relación virtuosa del individuo consigo mismo en la que se acredita la propia índole moral a través del trato no destructivo de los seres inanimados y vivos de la naturaleza...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} an ethnographic {{exploration of}} the emergent scientific field of biogerontology (otherwise known as the biology of ageing) ‘in the making’ at its different sub-sites. Specifically, biogerontology, as a field on the frontiers of science research in the UK and US, seeks to redefine ageing as malleable and pathological. I examine this approach to ageing in relation to an ethics of care for all of life. By examining public biogerontology (conferences, media, academic publications), with an in depth focus on UK biogerontology, I illuminate biogerontologists’ perspectives and concerns, and I show how these are circulated in this public setting. By extending focus to two genetics laboratories where biogerontologists study ageing as a biological process (using model organisms), I {{provide insight into the}} mundane practices of biogerontologists, and I also offer comparison between the verbally expressed concerns of public biogerontologists and the practical labours of care in the laboratory setting. Moreover, I explore the fragmented, ambiguous, and complex ordering of care in the laboratory setting, which is part of viewing the field as a continual accomplishment. Whilst ‘good science’ as ‘excellence’ is shown to be the primary concern and care of the field, I also show moments in the laboratory setting where biogerontologists extend their care, as a practical and affectual labour, to the animal (models) that they are working with. As well as examining the standardisation of ageing, and the way that the animal (models) are figured as instruments, I conclude by showing that whilst life itself becomes instrumental in science experiment, the moments of care for life in the laboratory break from this <b>instrumental</b> <b>relation.</b> Furthermore, I show that these moments open up space for biogerontologists to reflect more deeply upon the field and its implications for the future of humanity and, also, all life on earth...|$|E
40|$|Aim: A major {{depressive}} episode is still a frequently discussed risk factor of suicidal behaviour. However, current studies suggest that depression is predictive of suicidal ideas but much less of suicidal act (Nock et al., 2009). This implies that suicidal behaviour should not only {{be seen as a}} symptom of a depressive disorder, but should be understood as an independent behaviour, which must be examined separately. The present qualitative study focuses on typical Plans and motives of suicide attempters compared to non-suicidal depressive individuals. Methods: Plan Analysis (Caspar, 2007), a clinical case conceptualization approach was used to analyze the <b>instrumental</b> <b>relations</b> between participants' behaviours and the hypothetical Plans and motives "behind" this behaviour. Video taped narrative interviews of 17 suicide attempters and intake interviews of 17 non‐suicidal depressive patients were investigated with the Plan Analysis procedure and a Plan structure was developed for each participant. These were used for establishing a prototypical Plan structure for each clinical group. Results: Results indicate that suicidal behaviour serves various Plans and motives only found in suicide attempters. Furthermore depressive patients pursue interpersonal control strategies which may serve as a protective factor for not evolving suicidal behaviour. Discussion. Findings are discussed with respect to current theoretical models of suicidality as well as implications for suicide prevention...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{revolves}} around the following question: what is the relation between technology and the subject, and what might this mean for any attempt to write the discourse of the subject itself? In {{the course of her}} discussion, Anderson suggests that Derrida’s arguments on the frame and photography (imaging technologies) represent a sophisticated means by which to think the subject, not as separate from but as technology. She argues that the subject-object dichotomy (and its accompanying ‘instrumental’ ontology) remains the default position for accounts of the relation between ‘man’ as organism and the artefacts and practices of technology. But, as Anderson shows, this assumption simply replays the humanist account of the subject in its <b>instrumental</b> <b>relation</b> to the phenomenal universe ‘outside’: with ‘technology’ cast in the guise of ‘other’. Using Derrida’s critique of Kant on the frame (the parergonal) she deconstructs the dichotomy inside/outside, working across a series of analogies between the subject as presence/absence and the frame as a limit defined by its instability. Looked at from this perspective, boundaries between the inside and outside, the organismic and the technological, like those between the frame and what it separates, inevitably blur. The subject, by analogy, looses its outline, becomes indistinct: it is now simply an artefact of the scale at which phenomena are theorized. Subject must therefore be rethought: it can now be understood not simply as presence, but as presence-in-absence in alterity: as a dispersion or deferral across an array of systems - social, biological and material - within which and through which it is (re) constituted. By rethinking the subject in this way, we must inevitably rethink technology (and not just in its instrumentality: in its very ontology) : in this rethinking, subject and technology become mutually constitutive. Given this, Anderson’s paper attempts to raise some searching questions about the problematic boundary between soma and techne, subject and other...|$|E
40|$|Witold Lutoslawski {{is widely}} {{recognized}} as having contributed numerous innovations to the twentieth-century canon of "Western" avant-garde music. His contributions include new approaches to notation and aleatoric technique (especially in ad libitum sections), formal structure "chain technique" and unusual four movement forms), and pitch organization (interval pairing and non-serial twelve-tone approaches). While emblematic {{of many of these}} qualities, Lutoslawski's Third Symphony also demonstrates an overlooked aspect of his late compositions: multiple-directed linear processes. In my essay, I focus on linear processes within several levels of the musical structure (pitch, rhythm, orchestration, register, texture, and form), applying contour theory, set theory, and statistical analysis where appropriate. In Lutoslawski's Third Symphony many levels of the structure arrive at their goal in distinct places, are simultaneously oriented in different directions, or otherwise subvert each other. In addition, singularly directed linear passages interrupt each other in horizontal succession. These types of multiple-directed linearity are the objects of my study. Although multiple-directed linearity is not exclusive to Lutoslawski's music, it is a facet that has been overlooked or mentioned only in passing within Lutoslawski studies. The composition component of my dissertation is Proximate Spaces for piano and chamber orchestra. The formal continuity of Proximate Spaces was suggested to me by competing ideas of the 1990 's surrounding the search for a unified theory to explain the fundamental forces, dimensional composition, and existence of matter in the known universe. Much of the pitch material derives from a two-octave mode (18 pitches in series) and three subset hexachords of that mode. The work develops the tension between mechanistic devotion to this mode and episodes of free chromaticism, between strictly repeating rhythmic patterns and rhythmic variation, between instrumentation according to families and a free exchange of musical ideas regardless of <b>instrumental</b> <b>relation.</b> Initially aligned with the mechanistic paradigms of mode and regular rhythmic patterns, in several places the piano breaks free and attempts to incite revolt against the piece's system by abandoning strict adherence to these structures.

40|$|Context – Contrary to {{its sister}} {{relation}} of causality, for which many descriptive accounts exist, for instance of causal connectives in Dutch, French and English (Sanders and Sweetser 2009, Sanders, Spooren and Noordman 1992, Pit 2003) {{the notion of}} instrumental or tooling has received little attention in frame semantic, terminological or ontological approaches to language (Marsman et al. 2008). Recent research (Sambre and Wermuth 2009, 2010) {{has pointed out that}} these two relations are closely interrelated, to such an extent, that underlying causal patterns may contribute to the detection of explicit and implicit instrumentals. Moreover, on a formal level, the notions of causality and/or of instrumentality have been examined basically in satellite languages such as Dutch and English, in studies about prepositions or connectives for causes and their consequence, or, in Italian, in terms of complements and subordination type (Ferrari 2004; Renzi, Salvi and Cardinaletti 2001). Objective – The goal of this exploratory research is to model the <b>instrumental</b> <b>relation</b> and its corresponding causal rationale for a verb-framed Romance language like Italian, and to further develop and refine an ontological template for instrumentals as parts of causal processes, based on authentic language use of instrumental verbs. Theoretical framework – The analysis brings together Talmy’s (2000) seminal conceptual characterization of the instrumental as part of a (volitional) causing action leading to a caused action with an effect on the one hand, and FrameNet’s (2009) bottom-up definition of the Using and Causing frames and their core and non-core frame elements (FE). This global causal semantics for instrumentals, is complemented, in a second move, by the Construction Grammar description of real (written) language data in terms of these frames (Fried and Östman 2004). Methodology and corpus – We use the Italian La Repubblica newspaper corpus (Baroni et al. 2004), in two steps. First, we randomly look up verbal lemmas. Think of verbs like utilizzare, adoperare, fare da, fungere da, servire da, servirsi or valersi di. Second, the verbal patterns under study will be contrasted with the combined use of strumento/ mezzo nouns in NP or PP syntagms potentially interacting with causal verbs like causare or condurre. Expected results – We will present a conceptual template for instrumentality as part of causality complemented by an inventory of constructions for some basic causal verbs in Italian and the strumento/mezzo pair. The corpus examples are transcribed and inventoried as more complex (B) CxG instrumental-causal patterns based on syntactic order, part of speech and relevant frame element (FE) referring to the FU under study. These constructions allow us to provide more detailed semantics for the usage-based study of instrumentals. In line with Stukker et al. (2008) and in a more pedagogical vein Proudfoot (20052) and Nazarenko (2000), we conceive of causal relations across grammatical levels. Consequently, this pilot is one step in displaying the large array of (Italian) causal-instrumental evidence as a window on cognition. status: publishe...|$|E

The first psychotherapeutic session of every outpatient was video-taped and evaluated according to the Plan Analysis procedure. Inter-rater reliability was established between two independent raters and was considered sufficient. The detailed prototypical Plan structure of BPD showed two main tendencies: first, the important presence of support-seeking among these patients and second, the will to be in control and to protect oneself.

Çevre etiği literatürü, planlama disiplinin öznesi olduğu mekânsal müdahalelerin insanmerkezli bir tutum gösterdiğine vurgu yapmaktadır. Bu tez kapsamında, çevrecilerin davranışlarını biçimlendiren çevreye atfettikleri değerin ne olduğu ve doğal çevreleriyle kurdukları pratik ilişkinin nasıl gerçekleştiği araştırılmış bunun üzerinden projeleri destekleyenler ile yaşanan ihtilafın çevre etiği bağlamında yorumlanması hedeflenmiştir. Bu amaçla, 2016 yılı Şubat ayında Kaz Dağları'nda yöredeki termik santral, HES ve madencilik projelerine muhalefet eden 16 çevreci ile derinlemesine mülakatlar yapılmıştır. Mülakatlar neticesinde, yöredeki çevrecilerin söylemleri ve davranışları değerlendirilerek gündelik pratikleri, çevreye karşı tutumları ve çevreye atfettikleri değerler üzerinden yorumlanmıştır. Yerelden kaynaklanan itirazlar ile projeleri destekleyenler arasındaki ihtilafın, değer teorisi bağlamında içkin-araçsal değer ikiliğine denk düşüp düşmediği sorgulanmıştır. Ancak, bu tür bir kategorik ayrımı ifade etmenin mümkün olmadığı sonucuna varılmıştır. Bununla birlikte, çevre literatürü kapsamında insanmerkezli ve çevremerkezli yaklaşım ikiliği takip edilmekle birlikte bu ikisi arasındaki sınırı net bir şekilde çizmek her zaman mümkün olmamaktadır. Her iki yaklaşımın pratiği zaman zaman benzeşmekte, ancak felsefi argümanları farklılaşmaktadır. Kaz Dağları ve yöresinde yapılan arazi çalışması bu durum ile paralellik göstermektedir. Yöredeki çevrecilerin davranışları dar bir insanmerkezli yaklaşımı reddeder nitelikte ancak gündelik pratiklerinin doğa ile kurduğu araçsal ilişkiyi de reddetmeyerek insanmerkezli bir tutum sergilemektedir. Bu çalışmanın en önemli çıktıları, yöredeki çevrecilerin, kimlik ve kökenlerine göre farklılaşan tutumlarıdır. Yöredeki çevreciler arasında, sonradan yöreye yerleşenler ile doğma büyüme yerli olanlar arasında yaklaşım farkı dikkat çekicidir.

We {{are facing}} several stuggles and {{challenges}} between local people and planning professionals or investors during planned particular energy plants, hydroelectric plants and mining projects over natural areas. Literature of environmental ethics emphasizes that human interventions have a anthropocentric attitude where spatial planning {{is a leading}} dicipline of them. In scope of this thesis, what is framing the value of environment of local pro-environmetalist behaviour, and how is pro-environmentalist's practice over nature have been questioned. Consequently, It is aimed to interpret those struggles and challenges within context of environmental ethics. With this design, in February of 2016, 16 in-depth interviews was conducted with distinctive portraits of local pro-environmentalist of Mount Ida (Kaz Dağları). Those pro-environmentalist people are the subjects of several protests against hiydroelectric plant, coal plant and golden mining projects. Daily practice, environmental attitudes and environmental values of those people have been interpreted according to their daily practices and discources. Neverthless, {{it is not possible}} to state such a categoric distinction between two poles of the struggles. However, we can follow the duality between anthropocentrism and eco-centrism, it is not easy to draw a concrete distinctive border between them. It has a flexible and permanent space among them. The practice of both of them sometimes is in accord with each other. Although, practice of those two different approaches resemble each other, philosophical argumentations of them become distinct. The field study of Mount Ida presents parallelism with this statement. Local pro-environmentalist's practice related to nature include intrumentalisation of nature, on the other hand, they reject a narrow anthropo-centrism approach and appropriate eco-centric discourses. The main outcome of the study is defining differentiations of local people in themselves according to their identity and origins. The locals who have born there and who have settled later have been two distinctive groups with their approaches. This distinction is also located among flexible space between eco-centrism and anthropo-centrism. Morover, 8 characteristic distinction have been defined according to field studies among the local environmentalists. Those are: (1) the distinction between locals who have been born there and who have migrated later, (2) differed approaches according to consequences of projects impact on different environmental context, (3) hierarchy among natural assets have been defined, and priority of Mount Ida have been emphasized by local people, (4) "Beauty of Nature" have been emerged as local terminology when local people ground their behavior, (5) "Nature" as a dogmatic concept among local people, (6) Sustainability concept as a well-accepted methods of intervention over nature, (7) lack of participation which is highly criticized element of the project by local people, (8) Instrumental Value of nature is highly respected and facilitate human-nature interaction of local people. (1) It is possible mention about two differentiated groups of pro-environmentalist groups among local people who react spatial intervention over nature. Those are local people who have born in the location and who are migrated to the region. Most of the people who born there, are peasant. Moreover, their main source of income are agricultural related business. On the other hand, the people who migrated to this region are most fee-earning people or pensionaries. This distinction causes differentiated approach to nature and agricultural sectors. First group's opinion of nature is more subjective while second's groups are more objective. It is because of their economic relation determined relation with nature. Moreover, first groups regard their relation with earth more natural even they are facilitate the land. Economic dependency makes first group more subjective and less critical. Second groups able to criticize agricultural production and its impact over nature. (2) Maintaining the life style which is more communed with nature is a common argument against spatial intervention. Struggle and challenges are arouse from this concern of local people that indicate the <b>instrumental</b> <b>relation</b> with nature. Event they emphasize the integrity of nature, balance of nature and sustainability of ecological systems. (3) One of another common approach of local people is hierarchy of consequences of spatial intervention. They distinguish the level of impact when an intervention occurs. The daily practice of rural life or agricultural accepted as more light intervention when comparing interventions such as building factories, excavation or dam projects. This attitude does not indicate an categorical challenge. On the other hand, local people concern and recognize level of interventions. So, they interpret interventions according to level of its impact over nature. (4) One of the conspicuous concept during interviews was "beauty of nature". This abstract concept is one of the prominent argument for local people's behavior. It is expressed as an inherent value of people, on the other hand this concept remains as subjective approach to nature. (5) One of another conspicuous concept is "nature" itself as a dogma. Especially, local people who born there, express this concept and reject to criticize it. It is highly bounded with religious ideas. The status of dogma constituted by the benefaction of land. And, this economical and vital relation emerged nature itself as a dogma. It is also interpreted as a instrumental value of nature, even people express it as abstract concept. (6) One of the common subject of the local people is scientific argumentation. All local people express their objection of intervention by facilitating scientific approaches. They are highly respect the ecological solutions of energy production. They offer renewable energy as alternative. Therefore, this approach also shows better solution or environmental friendly spatial interventions would be pleased by local people. Mostly the local people trust in scientific and technological development to deal with nature. (7) Another element of the critics by local people is lack of participation. Local people is not involved in decision making process. It makes local people more reactional and mistrustful. It is clear that if the decision making process we Behavior Planning (8) re more participant and respect local people, the behavior of the local people would be changed. (9) Finally, In terms of ethical conception of human-nature relation: {{it is not possible to}} state that the challenge between local people and who planned those intervention, corresponds to categorical position.

O Conselho de Segurança das Nações Unidas, através da Resolução 1542, de 2004, decidiu enviar uma força multinacional para restaurar a estabilidade civil no Haiti, após a crise política do governo de Jean Bertrand Aristide, deflagrada em 29 de fevereiro de 2004, que forçou o presidente Aristide a se retirar do poder e exilar-se primeiramente, na República Centro-Africana e posteriormente na África do Sul, após múltiplas manifestações populares e diversas ações políticas contra seu governo. Mais de oito anos desde a sua implantação, as opiniões nacionais apresentadas aqui por dois setores da sociedade civil Haitiana, a saber, os educadores e os camponeses, foram investigadas em relação à percepção de cada grupo acerca da presença de uma força militar no Haiti pela Missão das Nações Unidas para Estabilização do Haiti (MINUSTAH). A opinião dos dois setores organizados da sociedade civil pesquisados, aqui representados pelo Sindicato do setor da educação, a CNEH (Confédération Nationale des Éducateurs d'Haïti) e o grupo de camponeses representado nesta pesquisa por meio de duas principais regiões do país: o Norte e o Sul, oscilam entre a percepção de que a MINUSTAH pode ser interpretada como uma ocupação militar de caráter neo-colonialista, uma missão humanitária ou uma missão de apoio ao fortalecimento institucional do país. Ao confrontar estas correntes de pensamento com a trajetória histórica do povo haitiano, representada depois da época do início da fundação do Estado-Nação, em 1804, pelo antagonismo e divergências de pontos de vista entre as elites e as massas, percebe-se que a imagem que os dois grupos pesquisados fazem da MINUSTAH resultam, em primeiro lugar, da maneira pela qual cada grupo constrói a idéia de nação haitiana ou da “nação haitiana imaginada”. No limite, a percepção em termos aceitação ou não da presença da MINUSTAH em solo haitiano, depende do grau de envolvimento que cada grupo mantém com as elites de Port-au-Prince. É possível afirmar que o grupo dos camponeses, historicamente alijados do poder e do jogo político da capital não constroem uma oposição política sistemática à MINUSTAH. Como estão acostumados ao jogo clientelista ofertado pelas elites em contextos eleitorais, reproduzem a mesma relação {{instrumental}} com os militares da MINUSTAH e vêem interesse na permanência da Missão no país. Por outro lado, os educadores sindicalizados, que representam historicamente um grupo de elite que se opõe à visão de mundo dos camponeses, tendem a divergir de uma interpretação positiva acerca da MINUSTAH e o fazem por meio da instrumentalização de um discurso nacionalista que exclui os estrangeiros em solo haitiano. Esta divergência de interpretação acerca da presença da MINUSTAH reproduz e aprofunda as já históricas e consolidadas contradições construídas entre as elites e as massas camponesas haitianas, forjando uma interpretação contextual da MINUSTAH de acordo com o lugar de fala de cada grupo, impossibilitando uma visão única do povo haitiano sobre a Missão. _______________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThe United Nations Security Council, through Resolution 1540, {{adopted in}} 2004, {{decided to send}} a multinational force {{in an effort to}} reestablish civil stability in Haiti after the political crisis of the Jean Bertrand Aristide government, which erupted on February 29, 2004. The crisis forced president Aristide to leave power and exile himself first to the Central African Republic and later to South Africa, after multiple popular protests and divers political actions against the government. More than eight years since the implementation of the United peacekeeping force, the opinions presented here are of two national sectors of Haitian civil society, namely, educators and farmers, and are investigated in relation to the perceptions each group holds about the presence of military force in Haiti through the United Nations Mission for the Stabilization of Haiti (MINUSTAH). The opinions of the two organized civil society sectors researched, here represented by the Education Union (Confédération Nationale des Éducateurs d'Haïti) and the farmers' group represented in this project through two principle regions of the country: the North and the South, oscillate between the perception that MINUSTAH could be interpreted as a military occupation characterized by neo-colonialism, a humanitarian mission or a mission to support and reinforce institutions in the country. In confronting these different thought currents with the historical trajectory of the Haitian people, represented in the time after the foundation of the Nation-State, in 1804, by the antagonism and divergence of viewpoints between the elites and the masses, it is possible to note that the image that the two researched groups have of MINUSTAH result, in the first place, {{in the way in which}} each group constructs the idea of the Haitian nation or of the "imagined Haitian nation. " At the most, the perceptions in terms of the acceptance or not of MINUSTAH presence on Haitian soil depend on the degee to which each group is involved with the elites of Port-au-Prince. It is possible to state that the farmers' group, historically excluded from the capital's power in the political arena do not construct a political systematic opposition to MINUSTAH. Since the farmers are accustomed to the clientelist nature of the elites in electoral contexts, they reproduce the same <b>instrumental</b> <b>relation</b> with the MINUSTAH military personnel and have an interest in the permanence of the MINUSTAH mission in the country. On the other hand, the unionized teachers, who historically represent an elite group that is opposed to the world vision of the farmers, tend to diverge from a positive interpretation about the MINUSTAH and show this through the use of a nationalist dialogue that excludes foreigners from Haitian soil. This divergence in interpretation around the presence of MINUSTAH reproduces and deepens the already consolidated and contradictory history constructed between elites and the Haitian masses, primarily farmers, forging a contextual interpretation of MINUSTAH according to the perspective of each group, preventing one single opinion from the Haitian people on the mission. _______________________________________________________________________________________ REZIMEKonsey sekirité nasyon zini,nan yon decisyon ki relé “Resolisyon 1542 ”li pran nan Lané 2004,décidé voyé yon fos miltinasyonal pou kA remete lape ak estabilite em ayiti,depi apre grwo problem politik ke gouvennman presidan Aristid La te konnen,jiskaske li te tombe,oblige,limenm te retire ko-l nan pouvwa,pati ale na eksil pou yon ti tan nan repiblik Sant Afrik e apre sa nan Peyi Afrik di Sid,lakoz dechenennman,latriye manifestasyon nan La ri,manigans politik tout kalite kont pouvwali-a.

Contextualized by discussion {{of political and}} social psychological models of intergroup contact, we extend principles of social identity theory to address structural differentiation within groups. Subgroup identity threat plays a pivotal role in the nature of subgroup relations, as do the social realities of specific subgroup relations (i. e., inclusiveness, nested vs. crosscutting categories, leadership, <b>instrumental</b> goal <b>relations,</b> power and status differentials, subgroup similarity). Our analysis suggests that subgroup identity threat is the greatest obstacle to social harmony; social arrangements that threaten social identity produce defensive reactions that result in conflict.
