40|$|Abstract — When the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) falls below {{a certain}} level, {{the error of}} the Time-of-Flight (ToF) Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) {{increases}} abruptly due to the wellknown threshold effect. Nevertheless, operating near and below the threshold SNR value might be necessary for many remote sensing applications due to imposed power-related constraints. These constrains might include a limit on the maximum power of a single source pulse or a limit on the total power used by multiple signals transmitted during a single measurement. For narrowband signals, the threshold effect emerges mostly due to outliers induced by local maxima of the autocorrelation function of a source signal. Following the previously explored path of biosonar-inspired <b>echo</b> <b>processing,</b> this paper introduces a new method for ToF estimation {{in the presence of}} outliers. The proposed method employs a bank of phase-shifted unmatched filters for generating multiple biased but only partially correlated estimators (multiple experts).

40|$|When {{searching for}} prey, big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) enhance {{the range of}} their sonar by concentrating more energy in the nearly constant-frequency (CF) tail portion of their frequency-modulated (FM) sweeps. We hypothesize that this portion of their signals may be {{vulnerable}} to interference from conspecifics using the same frequencies in their own emissions. To determine how bats modify their signals when confronted with an interfering stimulus, we compared the echolocation calls of bats when a CF jamming tone was on and off. The bats performed a two-alternative forced-choice detection task in the laboratory that required the use of echolocation. All three bats shifted the tail-end CF component of their emitted frequency bidirectionally away from the CF jamming stimulus only when the jamming frequency was within 2 – 3 ·kHz of the preferred baseline frequency of the bat. The duration of their emissions did not differ between the jamming and no-jamming trials. The jamming avoidance response of bats may serve to avoid masking or interference in a narrow range of frequencies important for target detection.

The {{effective}} {{separation of}} the multilayer ultrasonic echo is the key for layered defective imaging and feature information identification; it is an urgent bottleneck problem {{to be addressed in}} the multilayer ultrasonic <b>echo</b> <b>processing</b> field.

40|$|Echolocating {{big brown}} bats (Eptesicus fuscus) {{broadcast}} ultrasonic frequency-modulated (FM) biosonar sounds (20 – 100 kHz frequencies; 10 – 50 μs periods) and perceive target range from echo delay. Knowing the acuity for delay resolution {{is essential to}} understand how bats process echoes because they perceive target shape and texture from the delay separation of multiple reflections. Bats can separately perceive the delays of two concurrent electronically generated echoes arriving as little as 2 μs apart, thus resolving reflecting points as close together as 0. 3 mm in range (two-point threshold). This two-point resolution is roughly five times smaller than the shortest periods in the bat’s sounds. Because the bat’s broadcasts are 2, 000 – 4, 500 μs long, the echoes themselves overlap and interfere with each other, to merge together into a single sound whose spectrum is shaped by their mutual interference {{depending on the size}} of the time separation. To separately perceive the delays of overlapping echoes, the bat has to recover information about their very small delay separation that was transferred into the spectrum when the two echoes interfered with each other, thus explicitly reconstructing the range profile of targets from the echo spectrum. However, the bat’s 2 -μs resolution limit is so short that the available spectral cues are extremely limited. Resolution of delay seems overly sharp just for interception of flying insects, which suggests that the bat’s biosonar images are of higher quality to suit a wider variety of orientation tasks, and that biosonar <b>echo</b> <b>processing</b> is correspondingly more sophisticated than has been suspected...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} reported that an early-blind echolocating individual (EB) showed robust occipital activation when he identified distant, silent objects based on echoes from his tongue clicks (Thaler, Arnott, & Goodale, 2011). In {{the present study}} we investigated {{the extent to which}} echolocation activation in EB's occipital cortex reflected general echolocation processing per se versus feature-specific processing. In the first experiment, echolocation audio sessions were captured with in-ear microphones in an anechoic chamber or hallway alcove as EB produced tongue clicks in front of a concave or flat object covered in aluminum foil or a cotton towel. All eight echolocation sessions (2 shapes× 2 surface materials× 2 environments) were then randomly presented to him during a sparse-temporal scanning fMRI session. While fMRI contrasts of chamber versus alcove-recorded echolocation stimuli underscored the importance of auditory cortex for extracting echo information, main task comparisons demonstrated a prominent role of occipital cortex in shape-specific <b>echo</b> <b>processing</b> {{in a manner consistent with}} latent, multisensory cortical specialization. Specifically, relative to surface composition judgments, shape judgments elicited greater BOLD activity in ventrolateral occipital areas and bilateral occipital pole. A second echolocation experiment involving shape judgments of objects located 20 ° to the left or right of straight ahead activated more rostral areas of EB's calcarine cortex relative to location judgments of those same objects and, as we previously reported, such calcarine activity was largest when the object was located in contralateral hemispace. Interestingly, other echolocating experts (i. e., a congenitally blind individual in Experiment 1, and a late blind individual in Experiment 2) did not show the same pattern of feature-specific echo-processing calcarine activity as EB, suggesting the possible significance of early visual experience and early echolocation training. Together, our findings indicate that the echolocation activation in EB's occipital cortex is feature-specific, and that these object representations appear to be organized in a topographic manner...|$|E

40|$|The use {{of active}} natural {{echolocation}} as a mobility aid for blind humans has received increased scientific and popular attention {{in recent years}} (Engber, 2006; Kreiser, 2006; NPR, 2011), {{in part due to}} a focus on several blind individuals who have developed remarkable expertise. However, perhaps surprisingly, the history of empirical human echolocation research is not much younger than the era of echolocation research (cf. Griffin, 1958). Nevertheless, compared to its bat and cetacean counterparts (Thomas et al., 2004), the field today remains in a state of comparative infancy. Until quite recently, nearly the entire body of human echolocation research has been behavioral in nature, with little insight into perceptual and neural mechanisms. Thus, the goal of this manuscript is to broadly integrate research findings in human echolocation across time, levels of analysis, and methodology. We will define human echolocation as it has been operationalized in research and practice, review behavioral goals served by echolocation, and identify putative auditory cues and neural mechanisms underpinning human echolocation. We examine some individual differences in echolocation performance, particularly involving blind compared to sighted persons. We present two studies in detail, addressing the spatial acuity of echolocation skills in sighted volunteers and blind experts. Throughout, we identify outstanding theoretical and applied questions that may form the basis for ongoing and future research. Taken together, we conclude that echolocation can serve behaviorally relevant perceptual goals; that spatial echolocation tasks such as size discrimination can be learned by sighted subjects, not just the blind; that the spatial resolution of echolocation can rival that of peripheral vision; that the variegated cues driving echolocation performance are processed at multiple levels of the auditory system; and that blindness likely {{plays an important role in}} shaping individual differences in <b>echo</b> <b>processing...</b>|$|E
40|$|Bats are {{the only}} mammals capable of true flight, and are the second-most speciose {{mammalian}} radiation, represented by over 1200 extant species. Key to their evolutionary success was echolocation, which is a complex trait requiring specializations for vocalization, hearing, and <b>echo</b> <b>processing.</b> Because they rely on detecting and analyzing echoes that may return greatly attenuated relative to their outgoing calls, interference from non-target ‘clutter’ echoes poses a challenge for echolocating bats. Here, I demonstrate that the echolocating bat Eptesicus fuscus alters its echolocation behavior to ameliorate the impact of clutter echoes when tracking a moving target, and that the magnitude of its behavioral adjustments depended on the distance and angular offset of two symmetrically placed ‘distracter’ objects. Furthermore, I found that individual bats make different adjustments to their calls, call timing, or head movements, suggesting that multiple strategies for echolocating in clutter may exist. In my second chapter, I examined the expression patterns of hearing-related genes in juvenile bats. Biomedical research establishing the functional roles of hearing genes rarely examines gene expression beyond the early post-natal stage, even though high frequency hearing does not mature until late in development. I show that several key hearing genes implicated in human deafness are upregulated in juvenile bats relative to adults, or exhibit sustained upregulation through the developmental period corresponding to the maturation of echolocation behavior. In my third chapter, I review the evolution of high frequency hearing in mammals, focusing on echolocating bats and whales, which have independently evolved this complex trait. I {{provide an overview of}} recent studies that have reported molecular convergence in hearing genes among distantly related echolocators, and assert that the contribution of gene expression to hearing deserves further investigation. Finally, I argue that echolocators provide a unique opportunity to investigate the basis of high frequency amplification, and may possess mechanisms of hearing protection which enable them to prolong the use of echolocation throughout their long lives...|$|E
40|$|Echolocation {{has evolved}} in {{different}} groups of animals, from bats and cetaceans to birds and humans, and enables localization and tracking of objects in a dynamic environment, where light levels may be very low or absent. Nature has shaped echolocation, an active sense that engages audiomotor feedback systems, which operates in diverse environments and situations. Echolocation production and perception vary across species, and signals are often adapted {{to the environment and}} task. In the last several decades, researchers have been studying the echolocation behavior of animals, both in the air and underwater, using different methodologies and perspectives. The result of these studies has led to rich knowledge on sound production mechanisms, directionality of the sound beam, signal design, echo reception and perception. Active control over echolocation signal production and the mechanisms for <b>echo</b> <b>processing</b> ultimately provide animals with an echoic scene or image of their surroundings. Sonar signal features directly influence the information available for the echolocating animal to perceive images of its environment. In many echolocating animals, the information processed through echoes elicits a reaction in motor systems, including adjustments in subsequent echolocation signals. We are interested in understanding how echolocating animals deal with different environments (e. g. clutter, light levels), tasks, distance to targets or objects, different prey types or other food sources, presence of conspecifics or certain predators, ambient and anthropogenic noise. In recent years, some researchers have presented new data on the origins of echolocation, which can provide a hint of its evolution. Theoreticians have addressed several issues that bear on echolocation systems, such as frequency or time resolution, target localization and beam-forming mechanisms.
