40|$|I was {{impatient}} {{to read this}} new book by Douglas Biber and colleagues and discover their views on using corpus-based approaches to investigate discourse structure. However, the first point to make about the book, volume 28 in the John Benjamins series Studies in corpus linguistics, is its rather particular authorial status. This is not a book written solely by the three authors named on the jacket; nor is it however an edited volume. It is instead a multiauthored work, {{and in addition to}} Douglas Biber, Ulla Connor and Thomas Upton, there are 6 further co-authors: Budsaba <b>Kanoksilapatham,</b> Molly Anthony, Kostyantyn Gladkov, Eniko Csomay, James K. Jones, and Casey Keck. There are two single-authored chapters, Chapter 4 by <b>Kanoksilapatham</b> and Chapter 8 by Csomay, and the other chapters are written by a combination of two to four of the nine authors (the reader has to return to the preface for the precise authors ’ names). As a result of this complex structure, the book seems to fall between two stools, containing perhaps neither the variety of a volume of edited articles, nor the more streamlined focussed organisation of a more traditionally authored book. The first chapter provides a general overview of the methodological questions at issue. The ‘lead ’ authors (Biber, Connor & Upton) begin by discussing the three definitions of discours...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the frequencies and sequences of rhetorical move and steps with respect to Finding, Discussion, Result sections of applied/descriptive master theses in the field of Turkish language education. The population of the study is 339 applied/descriptive master theses in the field of Turkish language education which were scanned in the National Thesis Center of Higher Education Council. Ten percent (f= 34) of the theses were evaluated with the method of systematic sampling. In the study, primarily, move and steps which can occur in sections were identified. In this identification, for Findings, Discussion, Result, there is not a model that widely accepted -as Swales (1990) model for Introduction- in the literature. For this reason, by considering the models in the literature (Hopkins and Dudley-Evans, 1988; <b>Kanoksilapatham,</b> 2005; Nwogu, * Bu makale, Ankara Üniversitesi Sosyal Bilimler Enstitüsü Dilbilim Anabilim Dalı Türkçenin Eğitimi ve Öğretimi Bilim Dalında yapılan doktora çalışmasından üretilmiştir. ** Okt., Ankara Üniversitesi, DTCF, Türk Dili ve Edebiyatı Bölümü. Ankara. E-posta: onur. kan@ankara. edu. tr*** Prof. Dr., Ankara Üniversitesi, DTCF, Dilbilim Bölümü. Ankara. 1997; Yang and Allison, 2003), framework rhetorical move and steps list was constituted and it was presented to 3 faculty members who are experts in the field of textlinguistics. After taking the experts’ opinions, theses were examined according to rhetorical move and steps’ list. In the study, content analysis was used. Expertisation method was used for raising the study’s persuasiveness. These are the basic results obtained in the study: With respect to Findings, Discussion, Result, Giving general informations about the study, Stating findings, Commenting on findings and Recommendation are conventional moves; Indicating the chapter structure is optional move. It was obtained that in Findings, Discussion, Result sections linear presentation was not preferred and there wasn’t a dominant sequence. In addition to this, it was seen that there was a tendency at the closing moves...|$|E
