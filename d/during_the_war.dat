5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> the Army also trained {{animals for}} use in the trenches. Dogs carried messages; horses, mules and dogs were used to lay {{telephone}} and telegraph cables.

The financial cost to the Australian government was calculated at £376,993,052. Two referendums on conscription for overseas service had been defeated <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> preserving the volunteer status of the Australian force, but stretching the reserves of manpower available, particularly {{towards the end of}} the fighting. Consequently, Australia remained one of only two armies on either side not to resort to conscription <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war.</b>|$|E

5|$|The demands made by {{the colonial}} {{government}} on Congolese workers <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> provoked strikes and riots from the workforce.

5|$|While {{technically}} minded shortwave listening hobbyists dwindled <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> years {{due in part}} to {{the demands}} of military service, casual listeners seeking war news from foreign broadcasters increased. Shortwave receiver manufacturers contributed to war production. Zenith launched the multi-band Trans-Oceanic series of radios in 1942. In some other countries, <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> listening to foreign stations was a criminal offense. Established in 1939, 35-kilowatt Chinese shortwave station XGOY broadcast programming aimed at listening-restricted Japan. The station was often bombed by the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|A fairly {{peculiar}} economic phenomenon occurred <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> in {{that the}} Confederate government issued both regular money notes and interest-bearing money, although the United States did issue Interest Bearing Notes <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> that were legal tender for most financial transactions. The circulation of the interest-bearing money and the convertibility of one kind of money into the other was enforced by fiat and Southern banks were threatened with {{a return to the}} gold standard if they did not cooperate. Because of the amount of Southern debt held by foreigners, to ease currency convertibility, in 1863 the Confederate Congress decided to adopt the gold standard, although actual convertibility was not to come into effect until 1879 (hence the law never went into effect, being supplanted by the Coinage Act of 1873 {{and the end of the}} Confederacy).|$|E
