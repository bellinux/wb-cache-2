50|$|Changes to fire {{protection}} systems or items affecting the structural or fire-integrity or use (occupancy) of a building is subject to regulatory scrutiny. A contemplated change to a facility requires a building permit, or, if the change is very minor, a review by the local fire prevention officer. Such reviews by the Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) also help to prevent potential problems {{that may not be}} apparent to a building owner or contractors. Large and very common deficiencies in existing buildings include the <b>disabling</b> of <b>fire</b> door closers through propping the doors open and running rugs through them and perforating fire-resistance rated walls and floors without proper firestopping.|$|R

The smokestack later had to be demolished and rebuilt. It also suffered a total loss of offsite power, requiring {{the use of the}} onsite emergency diesel generators for several days. No significant damage was done to the plant's nuclear containment buildings. The plant was built to withstand winds of up to 235mph (380km/h), greatly exceeding the maximum winds recorded by most category 5 hurricanes.|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} to {{identify}} and analyze sources of water for fire extinguishing in a residential area. The residential area, which is analyzed in the thesis, is the village Stražišče pri Kranju, which has a medium rate of fire hazard. Most urban areas in Slovenia have a public water supply network, which is not only used for drinking and sanitary water, but also as the only resource for fire extinguishing. This is why a well maintained hydrant network with sufficient amount of water and pressure {{is the most important}} resource for fire extinguishing. A hydrant network in a condensed urban area must ensure at least 10 liters of water per second at the actual pressure of 2. 5 bar. Secondary sources of water for fire extinguishing are also present in the area, such as bodies of water and various water containers. These sources represent an important resource for fire extinguishing, especially when the water supply system is <b>disabled.</b> <b>Fire</b> extinguishing interventions would probably fail in such cases, if no secondary systems were present. The results show that one of the key problems is the organizational improvement of ensuring water for fire extinguishing, since this is not defined as a public service. This is why the problems of ensuring this water are solved separately, according to the situation and the agreements between the municipalities and public water suppliers. The organization of this area could be solved by making this task an obligatory responsibility of a public service. The thesis ends with starting points and suggestions for improving the efficiency of water supplying for fire extinguishing...|$|R

The two former Cunarders, since renamed Fairland and Fairwind, were laid-up at Southampton until reactivated prior to refurbishment in late 1970 and early 1971. The pair received major refits in tandem at the San Marco shipyards in Trieste. From 1972, SITMAR successfully built a fine reputation in the North American cruise market with Fairsea (2) (previously Fairland) and Fairwind.
