Now, the electronics industries are starting to find out whether the <b>display</b> <b>strategy</b> is also applicable in the electronics industry or not. There is big confusion about the definition of <b>display</b> <b>strategy,</b> the importance of having <b>display</b> <b>strategy</b> in their promotion strategy. Even now, the implementations of <b>display</b> <b>strategy</b> in multinational electronics industry still blur. The Authors use descriptive research as the research method, supported with the primary and secondary data from the observation, interview, and questionnaire. In the research process, the Authors find out that price and technology / features are the main consideration from the customers in buying electronics products. Besides that, see and try the product first are very important in buying decision of customers. The <b>display</b> <b>strategy,</b> especially the effective <b>display</b> <b>strategy</b> can increase the exposure of the products, thus increase the attractiveness and willingness of the customers to see and to buy the products. The implementation of <b>display</b> <b>strategy</b> will increase the sales performance of the company {{and at the same time}} the <b>display</b> <b>strategy</b> will strengthen the promotion activities of the company. The company should implement the effective <b>display</b> <b>strategy.</b> Since the implementation of the <b>display</b> <b>strategy</b> in the multinational electronics company can be nationally or globally, thus, the company needs to make standardized guidelines about the implementation of the <b>display</b> <b>strategy...</b>|$|R

This note extends Keen’s (2001) analy-sis of symmetric capital tax competition under preferential (or <b>discriminatory)</b> and <b>non-discriminatory</b> tax regimes to allow for countries of different size. Even though size asymmetries imply a redistribution of tax revenue from the larger to the smaller country, a non-discrimination policy is found to have similar effects as in the symmetric model: it lowers the average rate of capital taxation and thus makes tax competition more aggressive in both the large and the small country...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{experimentally}} {{analyzes the}} cartel coordination challenge {{induced by the}} discrimination of cartel ringleaders in leniency policies. Ringleaders often take {{a leading role in}} the coordination and formation of a cartel. A leniency policy which grants amnesty to all "whistleblowers" except for ringleaders may therefore reduce the incentive to become a ringleader and may disrupt cartel formation. We analyze <b>discriminatory</b> and <b>non-discriminatory</b> leniency policies in a multi-stage cartel formation experiment where multiple ringleaders may emerge. Although theory predicts that cartels will always be reported, whistleblowing rarely occurs. Paradoxically the discriminatory leniency policy induces more firms to become ringleaders, which ultimately facilitates coordination in the cartel...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Searching online {{information}} resources using mobile devices {{is affected by}} displays on which {{only a small fraction}} of the set of ranked documents can be displayed. In this paper, we ask whether the search effort can be reduced, on average, by user feedback indicating a single most relevant document in each display. For small display sizes and limited user actions, we are able to construct a tree representing all possible outcomes. Examination of the tree permits us to compute an upper limit on relevance feedback performance. Three standard feedback algorithms are considered- Rocchio, Robertson/Sparck-Jones and a Bayesian algorithm. Two <b>display</b> <b>strategies</b> are considered, one based on maximizing the immediate information gain and the other on most likely documents. Our results bring out the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithms, and the need for exploratory <b>display</b> <b>strategies</b> with conservative feedback algorithms. ...|$|R

Remotely sensed data produced by hyperspectral imagers contains hundreds of contiguous narrow spectral bands at each spatial pixel. The substantial dimensionality and unique character of hyperspectral imagery requires display techniques {{that differ from}} traditional image analysis tools. This study investigated the appropriate methodologies for displaying hyperspectral images based on the physical principles of human color vision and a generalized set of linear transformations. Principal components (PC) analysis is {{a powerful tool for}} reducing the dimensionality of a data set, and PC-based strategies were explored in creating a broadly applicable image <b>display</b> <b>strategy.</b> It is shown that the invariant <b>display</b> <b>strategy</b> and generalized eigenvectors developed within this study offer a first look capability {{for a wide variety of}} spectral scenes.

40|$|Variable message sign (VMS) is an {{effective}} traffic management tool for congestion mitigation. The VMS is primarily used {{as a means of}} providing factual travel information or genuine route guidance to travelers.

40|$|Data Mining {{is being}} {{increasingly}} {{used in the}} field of automation of decision making processes, which involve extraction and discovery of information hidden in large volumes of collected data. Nonetheless, there are negative perceptions like privacy invasion and potential discrimination which contribute as hindrances to the use of data mining methodologies in software systems employing automated decision making. Loan granting, Employment, Insurance Premium calculation, Admissions in Educational Institutions etc., can make use of data mining to effectively prevent human biases pertaining to certain attributes like gender, nationality, race etc. in critical decision making. The proposed methodology prevents discriminatory rules ensuing due to the presence of certain information regarding sensitive discriminatory attributes in the data itself. Two aspects of novelty in the proposal are, first, the rule mining technique based on ontologies and the second, concerning generalization and transformation of the mined rules that are quantized as <b>discriminatory,</b> into <b>non-discriminatory</b> ones...|$|R
40|$|The EU {{policy against}} harmful tax {{competition}} aims at eliminating tax policies targeted at attracting the internationally mobile tax base. We examine this issue by considering two countries which decide their corporate tax rates their tax regimes (<b>discriminatory</b> or <b>non-discriminatory</b> tax policy). Firms produce under imperfect competition and trade between countries is costly. The endogenous spatial allocation of mobile firms depends upon different parameters of the economy while the distribution of immobile firms is exogenous. We show that countries discriminate against immobile firms when trade costs are high. Trade integration makes imposing the same tax on all firms more appealing such that, at low trade costs, the unique Nash equilibrium is characterized by uniform corporate taxes being set by both governments. However, when trade costs reach intermediates values, fiscal competition may lead to tax discrimination while uniform taxation is socially preferredimperfect competition; preferential tax regimes; tax competition; trade costs...|$|R

30|$|To be precise, {{this notion}} is not {{literally}} true in Becker’s ([1971]) original model where the gender pay gap {{is the same}} for all women, no matter whether they work for <b>discriminatory</b> or <b>non-discriminatory</b> employers. However, this latter conclusion of the model hinges on the assumption that workers can instantaneously and costlessly switch employers. Once one builds in some forces restricting worker mobility, it does not hold anymore. For instance, Bowlus and Eckstein ([2002]) incorporate discriminatory employer preferences into Mortensen’s ([1990]) equilibrium search model with on-the-job search. They show that employers with more pronounced discriminatory preferences offer lower wages to women than employers with less pronounced tastes for discrimination and also end up with lower profits. Since intensified competition puts additional pressure on firm profitability, it restricts discriminatory employers’ ability to pay for discrimination, and it does more so for more discriminatory employers who already make lower profits than their competitors. Hence, we expect the unexplained gender pay gap to fall to a larger extent in plants with a lower share of females in their workforces 12.|$|R
40|$|Intervention {{strategies}} and developmental models of stress {{have been criticized}} for failing to integrate social psychological variables. This study investigates both self-referential cognitive mediators (perceived threat and control) and a social psychological moderator (ethnic/religious identity) of the effect of peer-victimization upon depressive symptomatology. Self-report questionnaires were completed by 924 students (46 % female), aged 8 to 12 years. Experiences of <b>discriminatory</b> and <b>non-discriminatory</b> peer-victimization, threat and control appraisals, depressive symptoms, and strength of main identity were assessed. Perceived threat partially mediated the effect of peer-victimization (regardless of whether it was discriminatory or not) on depressive symptoms. Perceived control partially mediated the effect of non-discriminatory peer-victimization on depressive symptoms. Strength of ethnic/religious identity buffered the effect of peer-victimization on depressive symptoms. Victimization perceived to be discriminatory in nature was more strongly associated with depressive symptoms than non-discriminatory victimization. Findings support calls for a greater emphasis to be placed on social psychological variables in explaining depressive symptomatology. For clinical, counseling and intervention purposes, it is important to examine whether victims perceive peer-victimization as discriminatory and whether their own strength of identity affects symptomatology...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{some common}} {{explanations for the}} earnings gap between males and females. Over recent decades, the average pay of women has increased faster than the average pay of men; however, a substantial earnings gap remains. As of 2006, the U. S. Census estimated that for year-round full-time workers the earnings ratio of women to men was 77 %; in other words, for every one dollar a man earns, a woman earns $ 0. 77. The wage gap likely consists of both <b>non-discriminatory</b> and <b>discriminatory</b> aspects, and concern remains over {{how much of the}} gender wage gap is caused by discrimination against women. However, the part of the wage gap due to discrimination cannot be measured directly, so it is typically interpreted as the portion of the gap that is “unexplained ” by other factors. Numerous economists and sociologists have studied this issue, but their conclusions differ vastly. This paper discusses various economic explanations for the gender pay gap, both <b>discriminatory</b> and <b>non-discriminatory.</b> It also briefly summarizes some sociological responses to economic arguments, as well as some polic...|$|R
40|$|Supply-chain {{interactions}} {{have huge}} economic importance, yet these interactions are often managed inefficiently. One {{of the major}} sources of inefficiency is information asymmetry; i. e., information that is available {{to one or more}} organizations in the chain (e. g., manufacturer, retailer) is not available to others. There are several causes of information asymmetry, among them fear that a supplier-chain partner will take advantage of private information, that information will leak to a competitor, etc. We propose Secure Supply-Chain Collaboration (SSCC) protocols that enable supply-chain partners to cooperatively achieve desired systemwide goals without revealing the private information of any of the parties, even though the jointly-computed decisions require the information of all the parties. Secure supplychain collaboration has the potential to improve supply-chain management practice, and, by removing one major inefficiency therein, improve productivity. We present specific SSCC protocols for two types of supply-chain interactions: Capacity allocation, and market-clearing transactions under <b>discriminatory</b> and <b>non-discriminatory</b> pricing. Hence this work bridges three distinct research areas: Secure Multi-party Computation (SMC), Mechanism Design (MD) and Supply-Chain Management (SCM). We also provide a framework for furthe...|$|R
