5|$|The Coastal Discovery Museum, in {{conjunction}} with the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, patrols the beaches from May through October as part of the Sea Turtle Protection Project. The purpose of the project is to inventory and monitor nesting locations, and if necessary, move them to more suitable locations. During the summer months, the museum sponsors the Turtle Talk & Walk, which is a special tour designed to <b>educate</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>about</b> this endangered species. To protect loggerhead sea turtles, a town ordinance stipulates that artificial lighting must be shielded so that it cannot be seen from the beach, or it must be turned off by 10:00p.m. from May 1 to October 31 each year.|$|E

5|$|In May 2009, the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) {{announced}} that fixing SR67 was number17 on its priority list, {{resulting in an}} estimated 2030 completion of a four-lane highway {{that would not be}} limited-access. A month later, Caltrans and the California Highway Patrol agreed to take more efforts to <b>educate</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>about</b> the safety issues. Signs were installed in 2010 to encourage drivers to practice safe driving habits; from January 2007 to early December2010, twenty-four people died from accidents on SR67. Following a March 2009 fatal crash, some of the survivors filed a lawsuit against Caltrans for negligence in maintaining and designing the highway, but the suit was decided in favor of the department. In a 2010 report, Caltrans suggested that two lanes could be added along the highway from I-8 to Dye Road in order to improve traffic flow.|$|E

One train driver interviewed in 2009 reported that he had worked as a driver for Vietnam Railways for over 10 years without receiving any training or professional development to improve his skills, which he had learned in Russia. Checks on drivers have also been suggested, along with random blood testing to detect whether drivers have used alcohol.|$|E

25|$|Stephens {{implemented}} {{a plan to}} <b>educate</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>about</b> {{the role of the}} Supreme Court by holding court in locations other than the state capital. In 1986, the court sat in Louisville, and in May 1987, it sat in both Owensboro and Paducah {{in the western part of}} the state. In 1988, however, Court of Appeals justice Dan Jack Combs objected to the court's plan to sit in Ashland, Pikeville, and Hazard, claiming the move was designed to help 7th District Justice James B. Stephenson retain his seat on the court. Combs was Stephenson's challenger in the election, and Ashland, Pikeville, and Hazard were the three most populous cities in the district. Stephens claimed the timing of the court's tour through the eastern part of the state was coincidental. Combs ultimately won a convincing victory in the election.|$|E
