40|$|The {{infrared}} spectra of tripalmitoyl <b>glyceride</b> confirm the tuning fork configuration previously attributed to trilauroyl <b>glyceride</b> (Small, D. M. 1986. Handbook of Lipid Research. Vol. 4). The acyl chains in solid tripalmitoyl glycerol, either within each molecule or between neighboring molecules, are oriented parallel {{to each other}} with the sn- 3 acyl chains extended toward the opposite direction of the sn- 1 and sn- 2 chains. The presence of cholesterol increases the orientational disorder of the tripalmitoyl <b>glyceride</b> molecules in terms of increased reorientational fluctuations and twisting/torsion motions of the acyl chains. In the solid mixture, cholesterol is embedded in the tripalmitoyl <b>glyceride</b> lattice which results in a reorientation of the acyl chains within each molecule from a parallel packing to a nonparallel packing. No evidence was found for hydrogen bond formation between the OH group of cholesterol and any of the three C = O groups of tripalmitoyl <b>glyceride.</b> Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

2500|$|Oxidative {{stress in}} cells and tissues {{produces}} Free radical-induced and singlet oxygen-induced oxidations of linoleic acid {{to generate the}} various racemic mixtures of 9-HpODE and 9-HODE in non-enzymatic reactions that produce, or are suspected but not proven to produce, approximately equal amounts of their S and R stereoisomers. [...] These oxidations are credited with being the major contributors to 9-HODE and 13-HODE isomer production in tissues undergoing oxidative stress such as occurs in any tissue suffering inadequate blood flow, inflammation, or other serious insult, in liver steatohepatitis, in the atheroma plaques of cardiovascular disease, in nerve tissues of neurodegenerative diseases, and in the various tissues compromised by diabetes (see oxidative stress). [...] Free radical oxidation of linoleic acid produces racemic mixtures of 9-HODE and 9-EE-HODE; singlet oxygen attack on linoleic acid produces (presumably) racemic mixtures of 9-HODE, 10-hydroxy-8E,12Z-octadecadienoic acid, and 12-hydroxy-9Z-13-E-octadecadienoic acid. [...] Since free radical-induced and singlet oxygen-induced oxidations of linoleic acid produce a similar set of 13-HODE metabolites (see 13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid), since both free radicals and singlet oxygen attack not only free linoleic acid but also linoleic acid bound to phospholipids, <b>glycerides,</b> cholesterol, and other lipids, and since free radical and singlet oxygen reactions may occur together, oxygen-stressed tissues often contain an array of free and lipid-bound 9-HODE and 13-HODE products. [...] For example, laboratory studies find that 9-HODE and 9-EE-HODE (along with their 13-HODE counterparts) {{are found in the}} phospholipid and cholesterol components of low density lipoproteins that have been oxidized by human monocytes; the reaction appears due to the in situ free radical- and/or superoxide-induced oxidation of the lipoproteins.|$|E

40|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{specificity}} of five lipases towards eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was evaluated in the hydrolysis of fish oil, squid oil {{and a model}} system. The model system contained methyl esters of EPA, DHA and palmitic acid. All the investigated lipases discriminated against both EPA and DHA more in the model system than in the natural oils. Thus both EPA and DHA were more easily hydrolysed from a <b>glyceride</b> than from a methyl ester. In the model system, the lipase from Candida rugosa showed the highest discrimination against DHA, while the lipases from Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas cepacia discriminated against EPA the most. In a <b>glyceride,</b> the fatty acid specificity of lipases towards EPA and DHA was affected by the positional distribution of the fatty acids and the <b>glyceride</b> structure due to the regiospecificity and triglyceride specificity of the lipase. In the oils, the Pseudomonas lipases also discriminated against EPA the most, while DHA was initially discriminated the most by the lipase from Thermomyces lanuginosus.
