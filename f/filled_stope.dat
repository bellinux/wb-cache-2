40|$|The {{extraction}} {{and processing}} of most mineral ores, {{result in the}} generation of large volumes of finer residue or tailings. The safe disposal of such material is of prime environmental, safety and economical concern to the management of mining operations. In underground metaliferous mining operations, where backfilling of mining voids is necessary, one option is to fill these voids with a tailings-based engineered product. In cases where the fill is placed as a slurry and the fill contains free water, permeable barricades are generally constructed to contain the fill within the mining void whilst providing a suitable means for the drainage water {{to escape from the}} fill. Recent barricade failures, resulting from poor drainage, have led to an immediate need for an increased understanding of the pore pressure developments and flow rates throughout the filling operation. This thesis presents simple analytical solutions, based on the ‘method of fragments,’ for estimating discharge and maximum pore pressure for two and three-dimensional hydraulically <b>filled</b> <b>stopes.</b> Shape factors were developed to account for the inherent individuality associated with stope and drain geometry. The influence of scaling on discharge and pore pressure measurements is also investigated. The proposed solutions are verified against solutions derived from a finite difference program and physical modelling of a scaled mine stope and results showed excellent agreement. Using these analytical solutions developed for flow through three-dimensional hydraulic <b>fill</b> <b>stopes,</b> a user-friendly EXCEL model was developed to accurately and efficiently model the drainage behaviour in three-dimensional stopes. The model simulates the complete filling and draining of the stopes and was verified using the finite difference software FLAC 3 D.

The finite element numerical modelling package ABAQUS/Explicit was used to model the behaviour of paste fill due to adjacent blasting in an underground mine. A paste <b>fill</b> <b>stope</b> was monitored during the extraction of two nearby stopes, and a series of field tests were carried out to provide data to validate the numerical models.

An approach devised by Robinsky {{in the early seventies}} for the storage and disposal of mine tailings suggests that it is more advantageous environmentally to strengthen the tailings before disposal. This work attempts to emphasize this point by seeking to explore the possibility of using these hardened tailings as base materials for the construction of unpaved (temporary access) roads. Six different types of tailings that represent a cross section from several mines in eastern Canada are used and preliminary physical characteristics tests were performed followed by unconfined compressive testing. Initial results indicate that the tailings sustained more than the minimum amount of stress normally required for <b>filling</b> <b>stopes</b> and the layer coefficients determined for five of the tailings used match reasonably well with values from ten United States state departments of transportation...|$|R
40|$|Paste fill is a {{cemented}} backfill used to {{fill the}} void left by mining to provide stability to the mine. It consists of tailings mixed with a small percentage of cement and water. As the mining sequence progresses and stopes adjacent to the fill are mined, the fill is subjected to blasting loads, and subsequently exposed. The purpose of this thesis was to study the effects of blast loading on paste fill, and the research consisted of experimental and numerical modelling components and some field work at Cannington mine. The field work involved monitoring of paste fill during production blasts, in situ tests in paste fill at Cannington mine and laboratory tests on the paste fill samples. Triaxial geophones were installed in stope 4261 at Cannington Mine, which had previously been mined and filled with paste fill. These geophones were used to measure the velocity waveforms produced in the stope during the blasting in two adjacent stopes. The data collected as part of this field work resulted in the estimation of a peak particle velocity at which paste fill begins to fail. The in situ tests involved monitoring the explosion of 9 blast holes in paste fill. Triaxial geophones were used to measure the velocity profile of each blast. The blast holes were detonated individually in order to obtain separate velocity profiles. The results were used to obtain a relationship between the peak particle velocity and the scaled distance from the blast. The laboratory tests were conducted to measure the attenuation of a wave as it travels through a column of paste fill. Paste fill was poured into a 2. 7 m long column in which 4 accelerometers were installed. A wave was induced in the column by striking the end of a column with a hammer and the particle acceleration was measured. The results were used to show the effect of paste fill mix on the attenuation of a wave. The finite element method based numerical modelling package, ABAQUS/Explicit, was used to model the behaviour of paste fill due to adjacent blasting in an underground mine. The first numerical model consisted of a single column of explosive detonated in paste fill. The results of this model were validated against the data obtained in the field tests. Once validated, the model was run for different mixes of paste fill to observe the effect of cement and solids content of the paste fill on its behaviour. A model of a single column of explosive in rock was also developed and validated using the same method. The model was then extended to include a single column of explosive detonated in rock adjacent to a paste <b>fill</b> <b>stope.</b> This model was run for a variety of blasting conditions to observe the changes in paste fill behaviour due to different blasting conditions. These different blasting conditions included varying distances between the explosive column and the rock/paste fill interface and various positions ofthe explosive column in relation to the paste <b>fill</b> <b>stope.</b> The model was finally extended to include a row of explosive columns parallel to the face of a paste <b>fill</b> <b>stope.</b> This model was run for a variety of blasting patterns and delay intervals to determine their effect on damage to paste fill. The model results showed that the peak particle velocity and therefore the damage to the paste fill reduced for increased cement contents of the fill. Similar results were observed for increased solids content, but to a lesser extent. The model results also indicated that the order of detonation and the delay time between the detonation of blast holes has little effect on the damage to the paste fill...|$|R
40|$|The mining {{industry}} {{relies heavily on}} empirical analysis for design and prediction. An empirical design method, called the critical span graph, was developed specifically for rock stability analysis in entry-type excavations, based on an extensive case-history database of cut and fill mining in Canada.

40|$|This {{study is}} based on {{confidential}} case studies collected from a Western Australian gold mine, known from here on in as ‘Mine X’. The primary mining method used at Mine X is longhole retreat open stoping with paste backfill. The main objective of this research project is to investigate which method/s is the most appropriate to develop the initial void for stope blasting at Mine X. Two methods were investigated during this research; conventional longhole rising and slashing against paste. Rising is a very common method, used frequently at Mine X {{as well as in}} the broader mining industry as determined through a literature review. Because of the common use of rising, it was expected to be a more reliable option resulting in a higher success rate. Slashing against paste, however, is a new method to the industry and not well documented, but was trialled as a possible cheaper option. These two methods were compared in terms of: success rate; drill and blast costs; limitations for their use; and benefits derived from combining the two methods. The analysis of the case studies revealed several key points. Firstly, the success rate estimated by comparing stope design geometry and final surveyed shape showed that both methods achieved the same success rate of 78 per cent. The cost analysis determined that the average rise required more than double the costs per tonne of rock than slashing against paste. Slashing against paste was found to be a much more restrictive option, requiring new stopes to be situated next to paste <b>filled</b> <b>stopes</b> of specific dimensions. Rising does not have these restrictions; however, more often required slot drives to be developed prior to stoping than slashing against paste. Combining the two methods proved to be a beneficial option having the advantages of both methods. Overall this study recommends, for Mine X, the use of slashing against paste over rising in situations where slashing against paste is permitted. All other situations should consider the use of rising or a combination of rising and slashing against paste. Upprättat; 2014; 20140919 (adrhal...|$|R
40|$|This paper utilises the {{two-dimensional}} finite difference package FLAC {{to investigate}} various factors affecting mine drainage including {{the effects of}} anisotropy, ancillary drainage and geometry on flow through hydraulic <b>fill</b> mine <b>stopes.</b> The numerical modelling carried out using FLAC shows that the horizontal ancillary drain provided {{at the bottom of}} the stope reduces the pore water pressure at all points within the fill substantially, however large the stope is, with the reduction being proportional to the length of the drain. For the case of stopes with horizontal ancillary drains at the bottom, a simple expression was developed to predict the maximum pore water pressure that always occurs at the bottom corner of the stope. The ancillary drain increases the hydraulic gradient and thus the rate of flow, resulting in quicker drainage of the stope. It was also shown that anisotropy in permeability of the fill material could also lead to a substantial reduction in pore water pressure. An increased knowledge of the factors affecting drainage will provide an increased level of confidence in design, more efficient mining procedures to be developed, and safer filling practices to be undertaken...|$|R
40|$|Determination {{of stress}} distribution, giving due {{consideration}} to arching mechanism within minefill stopes, {{is of great}} importance because of its influence on the ground stability, ore recovery and cost effectiveness. Most previous studies on stress determination and arching effects have been applied to vertical stopes, whereas research is lacking on inclined stopes. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the effect of inclination on arching action on stress distributions, with particular interest on the stress distribution at the base and on the side walls of the stope. Three separate modeling techniques are carried out to achieve the goal of the study, which are numerical, analytical and experimental methods. The studies develop analytical solutions from Marston's theory for inclined stopes with parallel and non-parallel walls, incorporating arching effects within the backfill, and propose a new analytical method developed from Pascal's triangle and binomial series for vertical stress determination in vertical and inclined minefill stope. Good agreement is seen between the two analytical methods for vertical and inclined stopes. The results show that with the same overburden pressure yz and base width B, the stress magnitude experienced by fill material can vary significantly with wall inclination. It is shown that lateral earth pressure coefficient, K and interfacial friction angle, δ has significant influence on vertical stress profile. K and δ should be taken as either K = K₀ and δ = 2 / 3 (0) or K = Kₐ and δ = (0) to better describe the state of stress within the minefills in underground stopes. A laboratory model is designed to simulate mine backfilling in an inclined stope and determine the average vertical stress at any depth within the <b>fill.</b> <b>Stope</b> inclination, wall roughness, relative density and aspect ratio are varied independently to study their influence on the stress distribution and arching effects. The highest vertical stress is observed at inclination about 80 ⁰ to the horizontal and shear stress experienced by the footwall increases with increasing stope inclination and wall roughness. The average interfacial friction angle can be used in analytical expression to predict the vertical stress within a stope with dissimilar wall characteristics. The study undertaken has also developed approximate solutions for the stress distribution within inclined stopes based on FLAC simulation. Three separate models are conducted in the simulation. They are laboratory model stope, a prototype minefill stope, and laboratory stope incorporated into rock mass to simulate minefill environments. There is good agreement among the analytical, numerical and the laboratory model results. Lateral earth pressure coefficient, K is better described by Kₐ for inclined minefill stopes...|$|R

40|$|Hydraulic fill is {{the most}} common type of {{backfill}} used in the underground mines in Australia and world-wide. These fills are granular in nature and are expected to have adequate drainage characteristics when placed underground in the form of slurry, enabling quick discharge of all excess water through the horizontal drives placed at various levels.

40|$|In current {{underground}} mining using "open stoping" methods, {{it is common}} to backfill mined-out voids ("stopes") using hydraulically placed backfill, which is commonly composed of tailings, to which cement is often added. Knowledge of the stress state within a backfilled stope is required for safe design of drawpoint barricades and for other operational reasons. This stress state depends, inter alia, on the degree of "arching" that occurs, resulting from the development of shear stress between the <b>fill</b> and the <b>stope</b> walls. This paper presents a numerical modelling study of aspects of the arching phenomenon, carried using the computer code Plaxis. The backfill is characterized using the Mohr-Coulomb soil model, and both dry backfill and saturated backfill are considered to completely cover the full spectrum of backfill types that are used in practice. It is shown that even with dry backfill, the behaviour is governed by a complex interaction between the soil parameters. The behaviour is more complex with saturated backfill, with a key parameter being the permeability of the backfill relative to the rate of filling - i. e., whether the backfilling operation can be considered to be "drained" or "undrained" or somewhere between these two extremes...|$|R

Bureau of Mines placed instruments in the B-North ore body of the Cannon Mine, Wenatchee, WA, to monitor cemented backfill and rock deformation during mining. The vibrating-wire gauges proved to be reliable and versatile, and {{approximately half of the}} instruments are providing data after 2 years of use. A two-dimensional, finite-element model was used to analyze the Cannon Mine's multilevel bench cut-and-fill mining method and predict rock and backfill displacements. The model accurately predicted rock displacements, but the predicted and measured displacements in cemented backfill had a correlation coefficient near zero, indicating that the model should only be used to predict rock displacements and not backfill displacements. A finite-difference model was also used to evaluate the stability of a cemented backfill pillar. Results can be used to conservatively predict backfill stresses, but on-site observation of pillar failures coupled with in situ measurements are needed to make more accurate predictions.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} use of hydraulically placed tailings backfill in mined-out voids (‘stopes') in underground mining, with the backfill being retained in the stopes by barricades built across the stope access tunnels. The forces acting on these barricades depend {{on the degree of}} consolidation that occurs during the backfilling process. A {{solution to the problem of}} consolidation in a layer increasing in thickness owing to ongoing sedimentation was proposed by Gibson in 1958. This solution appears to be directly relevant to the stope backfilling process, although there are limitations in applying it. Using material properties from two mine sites, the applicability of the Gibson solution to <b>stope</b> <b>filling</b> is examined. In particular, since one of the basic assumptions of the Gibson solution (that c v remains constant during filling) is generally violated, the effect of having a varying c v is explored using numerical modelling. Finally, the limitations of applying the Gibson solution to the stope backfilling problem are discussed. These relate particularly to the three-dimensional nature of stope geometry and drainage (compared with the assumption of one-dimensional conditions in the Gibson solution) and the fact that cement is generally added to backfill, such that the analysis herein is only valid up to the start of cement hydration...|$|R

The frictional behaviors of these interfaces were assessed for the short-term curing times (3  d and 7  d) using a direct shear apparatus RDS- 200 from GCTS (Geotechnical Consulting & Testing Systems). The shear (friction) tests were performed at three different constant normal stress levels on flat and smooth interfaces. These tests aimed at understanding the mobilized shear strength at the CPB-rock and CPB-CPB interfaces during and/or after open <b>stope</b> <b>filling</b> (no exposed face). The applied normal stress levels were varied in a range corresponding to the usually measured in-situ horizontal pressures (longitudinal or transverse) developed within paste-filled stopes (uniaxial compressive strength, σc ≤  150  kPa). Results show that the mobilized shear strength is higher at the CPB-CPB interface than that at the CPB-rock interface. Also, the perfect elastoplastic behaviors observed for the CPB-rock interfaces were not observed for the CPB-CPB interfaces with low cement content which exhibits a strain-hardening behavior. These results are useful to estimate or validate numerical model for pressures determination in cemented backfill stope at short term. The tests were performed on real backfill and granite. The results may help understanding the mechanical behavior of the cemented paste backfill in general and, in particular, analyzing the shear strength at backfill–backfill and backfill-rock interfaces...|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic fills {{are quite}} popular as {{backfilling}} materials for underground voids {{created in the}} process of mining. For ease of transport through pipes, they are placed in the form of slurry and allowed to settle freely under self weight. Stopes can be approximated as rectangular prisms, and may extend as high as 200 metres. The horizontal access drives, used for transporting the ore, are blocked by porous barricade bricks before backfilling. Failures of barricades, and subsequent in-rush of wet hydraulic fill into the mines, have claimed several lives and contributed to severe economic loss world-wide. The objective of this research is to carry out a thorough experimental study of the hydraulic fills and barricade bricks, with particular emphasis on load-deformation and drainage characteristics. Two separate numerical models were developed in FLAC and FLAC 3 D, to simulate the backfilling process and to monitor the pore water pressure developments, fill and water heights and discharge rates. So far, the findings of the research were disseminated through four journal papers, a book chapter and seven papers in refereed international conferences. Overall, this study will improve the current state-of-the-art in hydraulic <b>filling</b> of mine <b>stopes</b> significantly. More than 25 different hydraulic fills, from five different mines, were studied. All Australian hydraulic fills fall within a narrow band of grain size distribution and are classified as silty sands or sandy silts. Their specific gravity values range from 2. 8 to 4. 5.

40|$|Mining for {{minerals}} creates large voids underground {{which have}} to be backfilled to provide regional stability for subsequent mining operations. Hydraulic fill {{is one of the}} most popular backfill materials used to fill these underground voids, and is generally placed in the form of a slurry at water contents in the range of 30 - 45 %. Porous brick barricades are placed across horizontal access drives to retain the hydraulic fill, allowing free drainage and enabling the hydraulic fill to settle under its self-weight. Several accidents have been reported worldwide, where the porous brick barricades have failed, resulting in an inrush of the hydraulic fill slurry into the drives claiming lives of miners and causing heavy economic losses. A recent example of this is the barricade failure at Bronzewing Mine in Western Australia, where three miners were killed. The problems associated with the hydraulic <b>filling</b> of mine <b>stopes</b> in Australia, with special references to the numerical modelling and laboratory studies carried out to improve the current state-of-the-art in hydraulic filling of underground mines are discussed in this chapter. At James Cook University, extensive laboratory tests were carried out on more than 25 different hydraulic fills obtained from five different mines, in an attempt to fully understand their behaviour and to develop a geotechnical database for the mines. The data from laboratory tests compare well with the in situ measurements. Tests were also carried out on two types of porous barricade bricks that are commonly used in Australia, to quantify their permeability and load-deformation characteristics. Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua (FLAC) and Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua in 3 -dimensions (FLAC 3 D) were used to numerically model the drainage through the hydraulic fills and the stress developments within the fill. Due to arching mechanism, the vertical normal stresses within the stopes are significantly reduced. Typical parameters for hydraulic fills and porous barricade bricks are given in this chapter and these would be very valuable in numerical modelling exercises when no other data are available...|$|R
40|$|Mining {{is one of}} {{the major}} export {{industries}} in Australia. When the ore is removed from the ground voids are backfilled. Hydraulic backfill and paste fill are most common backfills. These backfills provide safe working conditions and increase the strength of the ground. Hydraulic backfills consist of classified mine tailings with not more than 10 % by weight of size less than 10 μm and approximately 70 % by solid weight. These are prepared on the surface by dewatering the mine tailings and transported to the stope transported by gravity through boreholes and pipelines. The solid particles of hydraulic fills settle rapidly after entering the stopes. Excess water initially tends to pond on the surface building up from the lowest corners of a stope and then commences a vertical path of drainage due to gravity. Several miners and equipment had been trapped in mines due to barricade failures and the resulting in rush of mine fills into the drives. An extensive study of drainage and settlement characteristics of hydraulic fills is required to improve design of drainage and barricades. Most permeability measurements reported in the literature are from undisturbed or reconstituted samples in the laboratory under no surcharge. However, in the mine <b>stopes</b> the hydraulic <b>fill</b> is subjected to significant surcharge due to the overburden. In this research, extensive laboratory tests have been performed to measure permeability of hydraulic fill samples subjected to vertical stress. An analytical solution has been developed to estimate vertical stress development in a vertical and inclined mine stope using continuous compression arch of principal stresses. It has been verified with different analytical model discussed in literature. Degree of saturation of hydraulic <b>fills</b> within mine <b>stopes</b> decreases with continuous drainage of water through barricades. Laboratory tests have been performed to study the moisture content variation in a mine stope with depth and time. Soil-water characteristic curves have been developed using Filter Paper Method for hydraulic fills. Permeability of hydraulic fill has been computed using vertical stress and moisture content variation in a stope. It has been shown graphically. The anecdotal evidence suggests that the consolidation of the deslimed hydraulic fill is instantaneous. In this dissertation, laboratory tests have been conducted using conventional oedometer and modified triaxial cell to measure the settlement of hydraulic fills. It has been found that the immediate settlement and time dependent settlement contributes equally to the total settlement. Pore water pressure dissipation has observed using modified triaxial cell. Time of consolidation and coefficient of consolidation have been estimated and reported. Settlement- effective stress- time plot has been used to investigate the variation of coefficient of secondary compression (Cα) and it has been observed that Cα of hydraulic fill increases with effective stresses and is independent of time. Concept of equivalent permeability has been used to estimate drainage and maximum pore water pressure in a stope using method of fragments. Empirical equation has been proposed to estimate water level in stope at any time after filling. Reliability analysis has been carried out using First Order-Second Moment Analysis Method to measure the effect of parameter and modeling errors in drainage and settlement analysis. It has been verified using Monte Carlo Simulation...|$|R
