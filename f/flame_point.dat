The approach we have developed is to compare the flowfields and mean flame properties under different gravitational orientations. Key to our study is the investigation of microgravity (mu g) flames. These mu g experiments provide vital information to reconcile the differences between flames in normal gravity (+g, <b>flame</b> <b>pointing</b> upward) and reverse gravity (-g, <b>flame</b> <b>pointing</b> downwards).

40|$|The area of oil crops, mainly rape, in Sweden {{today is}} about 165 000 hectares. About 280 000 tonnes {{of the harvest}} are {{processed}} and give about 100 000 tonnes of vegetable oil. The main part is exported to a low world market price. This oil could better {{be used as a}} fuel in Sweden. Using the oil would give us a better environment and make us more independent of the oil producing countries. When the rape oil is transesterified, it can be used in all types of diesel engines. Much test work have been carried out, both short time bench tests and longtime practical tests. All the tests have shown good results. The main advantages are that the fuel is renewable and doesn’t give any addition of CO 2 to the atmosphere. The transesterified vegetable oil is possible to mix with diesel oil. It also has a high <b>flame</b> <b>point</b> and is therefore easy to handle and store. Transesterified vegetable oil gives a little bit higher fuel consumption and a lower effect than diesel. To transesterify rape oil an alcohol, methanol or ethanol, is needed. To maintain the reaction at room temperature a catalyst is also needed, which can either be NaOH or KOH. The reaction formula is: 1 mol triglycerid + 3 mol methanol + catalysis 3 mol ester + 1 mol glycerol + catalysis To get a high value fuel the ester also needs to be cleaned, which could be done with water. Much research at universities and industries around the world has been done on transesterified vegetable oil. The production is fully developed and tested. But so far only Austria has taken the step from research to industrial production through investment subsidies and tax allowance. They also allow the companies to buy the oil seed to world market prices. A lot of countries have plans to follow. In the northern countries both Sweden and Finland have far going plans. In Europe, France is building an industrial plant for a production of 400 000 tonnes of oil per year. One important factor for the production is the economy. The cost for transesterification in Sweden is 1. 85 kr/l for a production of 13 000 tonnes per year and 2. 95 kr/ 1 for a production of 400 tonnes per year. Totally the cost for the oil is 4. 10 kr/l respectively 5. 60 kr/l. This should be compared with the diesel fuel price which is 3 kr/l, taxes included. Transesterified rape oil {{is one of the best}} substitutes for diesel oil we have today, both from an economical and an environmental view. The vegetable oil however can only substitute a part of the diesel fuel consumption...|$|E

5000|$|The colorpoint {{pattern is}} most {{commonly}} associated with Siamese cats, but may also appear in any domesticated cat. A colorpointed cat has dark colors on the face, ears, feet, and tail, with a lighter {{version of the same}} color {{on the rest of the}} body, and possibly some white. The exact name of the colorpoint pattern depends on the actual color, so there are seal points (dark brown), chocolate points (warm lighter brown), blue points (dark gray), lilac or frost points (silvery gray-pink), red or <b>flame</b> <b>points</b> (orange), and tortie (tortoiseshell mottling) points, among others. This pattern is the result of a temperature sensitive mutation in one of the enzymes in the metabolic pathway from tyrosine to pigment, such as melanin; thus, little or no pigment is produced except in the extremities or points where the skin is slightly cooler. For this reason, colorpointed cats tend to darken with age as bodily temperature drops; also, the fur over a significant injury may sometimes darken or lighten as a result of temperature change.|$|R

Two 'pom-poms' flickered away steadily {{from the direction}} of Doorn Kloof, making a regular succession of small bright <b>flame</b> <b>points.</b> Two more guns were firing from the hills to our left. Another was in action far away on our right. There may have been more, but even so it was not much artillery to oppose our eleven batteries.

Personally, I am convinced that future warfare will be to the few, by which I mean that to escape annihilation soldiers will have to fight in widely dispersed formations, when they will have to think for themselves, and when each must be to a great extent his own general; and with regard to artillery, it appears that the advantages of defensive action, range, concealment, and individual initiative may easily counterbalance numbers and discipline.

The characteristic parameters of the <b>flame,</b> including ignition <b>points,</b> brightness, temperature and oscillation frequency, are measured using a vision-based flame monitoring system in an on-line continuous mode. A common type of pulverised coal was fired with five different types of biomass for different proportions ranging from 0 % to 20 % by weight. Various combustion conditions were created during the test runs, including variations in excess air and the method of biomass injection. The relationships between the flame characteristics and the primary combustion process data are analysed. The results suggest that, due to the varying {{physical and chemical properties}} of the biomass fuels, the biomass additions impact on the characteristics of the flame, particularly the <b>flame</b> ignition <b>points</b> and brightness. However, in all cases studied, the flame stability {{has been found to be}} little affected by the amount of biomass added provided that the addition is no more than 20 %...|$|R

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} flame configurations and heat release distributions exist in high swirl, annular flows, due {{to the existence of}} inner and outer shear layers as well a vortex breakdown bubble. Each of these different configurations, in turn, has different thermoacoustic sensitivities and influences on combustor emissions, nozzle durability, and liner heating. This paper presents findings on the sensitivities of the outer shear layer- stabilized flames to a range of parameters, including equivalence ratio, bulkhead temperature, flow velocity, and preheat temperature. There is significant hysteresis for flame attachment/detachment from the outer shear layer and this hysteresis is also described. Results are also correlated with extinction stretch rate calculations based on detailed kinetic simulations. In addition, we show that the bulkhead temperature near the <b>flame</b> attachment <b>point</b> has significant impact on outer shear layer detachment. This indicates that understanding the heat transfer between the edge flame stabilized in the shear layer and the nozzle hardware is needed in order to predict shear layer flame stabilization limits. Moreover, it shows that simulations cannot simply assume adiabatic boundary conditions if they are to capture these transitions. We also show that the reference temperature for correlating these transitions is quite different for attachment and local blow off. Finally, these results highlight the deficiencies in current understanding of the influence of fluid mechanic parameters (e. g. velocity, swirl number) on shear layer flame attachment. For example, they show that the seemingly simple matter of scaling <b>flame</b> transition <b>points</b> with changes in flow velocities is not understood...|$|R

40|$|Direct {{numerical}} simulations {{are performed}} {{to investigate the}} transient upstream propagation (flashback) of premixed hydrogen–air flames in the boundary layer of a fully developed turbulent channel flow. Results show that the well-known near-wall velocity fluctuations pattern found in turbulent boundary layers triggers wrinkling of the initially flat flame sheet as it starts propagating against the main flow direction, and that {{the structure of the}} characteristic streaks of the turbulent boundary layer ultimately has an important impact on the resulting flame shape and on its propagation mechanism. It is observed that the leading edges of the upstream-propagating premixed flame are always located in the near-wall region of the channel and assume the shape of several smooth, curved bulges propagating upstream {{side by side in the}} spanwise direction and convex towards the reactant side of the flame. These leading-edge flame bulges are separated by thin regions of spiky <b>flame</b> cusps <b>pointing</b> towards the product side at the trailing edges of the flame. Analysis of the instantaneous velocity fields clearly reveals the existence, on the reactant side of the flame sheet, of backflow pockets that extend well above the wall-quenching distance. There is a strong correspondence between each of the backflow pockets and a leading edge convex flame bulge. Likewise, high-speed streaks of fast flowing fluid are found to be always colocated with the spiky <b>flame</b> cusps <b>pointing</b> towards the product side of the flame. It is suggested that the origin of the formation of the backflow pockets, along with the subsequent mutual feedback mechanism, is due to the interaction of the approaching streaky turbulent flow pattern with the Darrieus–Landau hydrodynamic instability and pressure fluctuations triggered by the flame sheet. Moreover, the presence of the backflow pockets, coupled with the associated hydrodynamic instability and pressure–flow field interaction, greatly facilitate flame propagation in turbulent boundary layers and ultimately results in high flashback velocities that increase proportionately with pressure...|$|R
