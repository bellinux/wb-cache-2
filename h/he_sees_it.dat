5|$|In the United States, the {{movement}} has drawn many followers from {{the middle class and}} is most popular in commuter towns and urban areas. In Exporting the American Gospel: Global Christian Fundamentalism Steve Brouwer, Paul Gifford, and Susan Rose speculate that {{the movement}} was fueled by a prevailing disdain for social liberalism in the United States that began in the 1970s. Rosin argues that prosperity theology emerged because of broader trends, particularly American economic optimism in the 1950s and 1990s. Tony Lin of the University of Virginia has also compared the teaching to manifest destiny, the 19th-century belief that the United States was entitled to the West. Marvin Harris argues that the doctrine's focus on the material world is a symptom of the secularization of American religion. <b>He</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> as an attempt to fulfill the American Dream by using supernatural power.|$|E
5|$|A boat draws up on {{the beach}} bearing the veiled figure of Leila, the virgin priestess whose prayers are {{required}} {{to ensure the safety of}} the fishermen. Although neither of them recognises her, she is the woman from Kandy with whom Nadir and Zurga had been in love. As Zurga is explaining her duties, she recognises Nadir, but she says nothing and shortly afterwards is led up to the temple by the high priest Nourabad. Zurga and the fishermen go down to the sea, leaving Nadir alone. In a troubled soliloquy before he sleeps he recalls how, in Kandy, he had broken his vows to Zurga and pursued his love for the veiled woman (""). It was the rumour that she might be found in this place that brought him here. Alone in the temple, Leila prays and sings. Nadir wakes and, recognising the voice of his long-desired lover, traces it to the temple. Leila briefly draws her veil aside, <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> is she and the pair declare their renewed passion. On the beach, the fishermen plead with her to continue protecting them, but she tells Nadir she will sing for him alone ("").|$|E
25|$|Robert Lockwood, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh’s {{director}} for communications, sees {{the notion of}} the Church conspiring to cover-up the truth about a Jesus bloodline as a deliberate piece of anti-Catholic propaganda. <b>He</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> as part of a long tradition of anti-Catholic sentiment with deep roots in the American Protestant imagination but going back to the very start of the Reformation of 1517.|$|E

500|$|Dave Farger of Fandango.com {{believes}} moviegoers {{are already}} adapting. When a film like Guardians of the Galaxy comes {{out at the}} time of summer it does, [...] " [...] feels like an event, regardless of the month."

500|$|Tobin {{experimented with}} various instruments. He {{does not come}} from a music family, nor has he had any formal {{training}} in music theory. About his music in general, Tobin says that <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> as a [...] "genuine" [...] expression of the time he lives in, as he says that by contrast, blues, jazz, and Brazilian genres were [...] "genuine" [...] expressions of the 1960s. Despite his indirect connection with Brazilian genres, Tobin collaborated with a number of artists on Bebel Gilberto's 2000 bossa nova album Tanto Tempo. Tobin's albums are often compared to soundtracks, and he says that movies by David Lynch have influenced him. In addition, he has stated to like films by the Coen brothers, Dario Argento, and Roman Polanski.|$|E

Nikolaj Arcel, the film's director and co-writer, said [...] "Matthew is an incredible actor who can do anything. That’s how I feel about [...] He could do anything." [...] Arcel described Walter as having [...] "a very interesting way of seeing the world. <b>He</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> {{with a sort of}} delight, even though he is obviously {{on the wrong side of}} the light-and-dark spectrum.

500|$|The Athsheans, in contrast, {{are shown}} as an {{innately}} peaceful and non-aggressive people, {{at least at}} the beginning of novel. Rape and murder are virtually unknown on the planet. They have adopted a number of behaviors that preempt violence; thus when Selver has Davidson pinned down after the attack on Smith camp, he finds himself unable to kill Davidson, despite the hate he feels towards the Terran. Selver spends much of the novel reflecting on the effect that violence has on his own culture. He turns to violence, against the Athshean ethic, in order to save his culture as <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it.</b> However, unlike Davidson, who enjoys killing, Selver sees it as something poisoning his culture. This perception is shared by his fellow Athsheans: one of the elders of the Athsheans says to Selver [...] "You've done what you had to do, and it was not right." ...|$|E
500|$|Cusack {{states that}} the Church [...] "must be accorded {{the status of a}} {{functional}} equivalent of religion, at the very least, if not 'authentic' religion". She sees it as [...] "arguably a legitimate path to liberation", citing its culture jamming and activism against commercialism. Kirby posits that the Church is a religion masquerading as a joke, rather than the reverse: in her view, it is a spiritual manifestation of a cultural shift toward irony. Alberts believes that there is broad agreement that the Church is fundamentally a different type of group than religions that date to antiquity; he prefers to use the term [...] "fake religion" [...] to describe the group. <b>He</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it,</b> along with Discordianism, as {{part of a group of}} [...] "popular movements that look and feel like religion, but whose apparent excess, irreverence and arbitrariness seem to mock religion". Knight characterizes the Church as [...] "at once a postmodern spoof of religion and a viable system in its own right".|$|E

500|$|Beyond {{the town}} the {{bridge over the}} river still exists and the river symbolizes time and timelessness, healing and the natural cycle of life and death. Nick is on a journey, perhaps <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> as a {{religious}} quest given the Christian symbolism of the fish. From the town, a road leads into pristine back-country. It crosses a bridge under which the trout hold steady against the current, just as Nick needs to hold steady. From the bridge he glimpses a kingfisher taking wing, a bird Johnston points out symbolizes [...] "halcyon days, peace and tranquility". A large uprooted tree symbolizes the protagonist himself uprooted by war, and that his fragility is symbolized by the trout he releases carefully {{so as not to}} damage its protective slime coat. The campsite symbolizes safety, set deep in a pine grove and described in soothing greens; beyond three dead trees in the background looms the swamp where he will not venture.|$|E
500|$|Lenny pines for Faith and {{relies on}} his two best friends, {{bodyguard}} and limousine driver Lornette [...] "Mace" [...] Mason and private investigator Max Peltier, for emotional support. Mace has unrequited feelings for Lenny from the past, {{from when he}} was still a cop and stepped in as a dependable father figure for her son after her boyfriend was arrested on drug charges, but disapproves of his SQUID-dealing business. While Lenny and Max are drinking together at a bar, Iris drops a SQUID disc through the sunroof of Lenny's car, but his car is towed away before <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it.</b> He is then picked up by Mace, who eventually agrees to take him to a nightclub where Faith is going to sing. In the club, Lenny receives a SQUID disc from a contact and then tries to get Faith away from her new boyfriend, music industry mogul Philo Gant, but to no avail.|$|E
500|$|Ward {{does not}} believe this {{a trick of the}} eye {{resulting}} from loss of perspective towards the high reaches of the panel. Instead <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> as a subtle reference to the iconography and mythology of the Book of Genesis' Tree of life, which he describes here as [...] "reborn in Christ's death". He does acknowledge the subtlety of the illusion, and the fact that neither of the two well known near copies include the motif. The idea of flowers shown as if sprouting {{from the top of the}} cross may have been borrowed from Masaccio's c.1426 Crucifixion, where flowers are placed on the upper portion of the vertical beam of the cross. Ward concludes than van Eyck took the idea even further by showing the flowers emanating from another source, and sought to depict the actual moment where the tree of life is reborn and [...] "the cross comes to life and sprouts flowers as one watches".|$|E

500|$|When {{finishing}} The Playboy, Brown felt {{guilt over}} {{still looking at}} Playmates and credits having come out in print with helping him overcome his shame. [...] While many have interpreted the book as a condemnation of pornography, to Brown {{it is about the}} guilt he was made to feel for using the media. [...] Some interpretations, such as those of Sullivan and Darrel Epp, see The Playboy demonstrating how the idealized images in pornography distort societal norms and expectations of beauty; one example cited is a scene in which Brown says he could only maintain an erection with one girlfriend if he fantasized about his favourite Playmates. [...] Brown has objected to this interpretation—rather, <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> as a flaw in the work, in that it does not provide enough context for what he intended to communicate: that he had gotten into a relationship with a woman whom he did not find sexually attractive, and that if Playboy did not exist he would have fantasized about other images of women.|$|E
500|$|To {{celebrate}} their victory in Iraq, the Bluths throw a shareholders' {{party on the}} [...] During preparation for the party, it is revealed that Lindsay was adopted, meaning that George Michael and Maeby are not blood relatives. At the party, the Bluth's other adopted child, Annyong, reappears. He reveals that he is there to avenge the Bluth family's theft of his grandfather's frozen banana idea {{and the cause of}} his subsequent deportation, an event orchestrated many years earlier by Lucille Bluth. Annyong has turned over evidence implicating Lucille in the Bluth Company's accounting scandals. Before the police arrive, Michael and George Michael flee on Gob's yacht, the C-Word, and depart to Cabo with half a million dollars in cashier's checks, finally leaving the family to fend for themselves. However, it is revealed in the epilogue that George Sr. is also on the yacht, having lured his brother Oscar into taking his place once again. Also in the epilogue, Maeby tries to sell the television rights to the story of the Bluth family to Ron Howard, who tells her that <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> as a movie rather than a series.|$|E
500|$|Each {{section is}} linked by a refrain or {{recurring}} chorus. It {{functions as a}} hook and it differs from the usual [...] "free-associative aspect" [...] of traditional blues. [...] Writer Benjamin Filene sees this and Dixon's desire to tell complete stories, with the verses building on each other, as sharing elements of pop music. [...] The chorus, [...] "But you know I'm here, everybody knows I'm here, Well you know I'm the hoochie coochie man, everybody knows I'm here", confirms the narrator's identity as both {{the subject of the}} gypsy's prophecy as well as an omnipotent seer himself. [...] Dixon felt that the lyrics expressed part of the audience's unfulfilled desire to brag, while Waters later admitted that they were supposed to have a comic effect. [...] Music historian Ted Gioia points to the underlying theme of sexuality and virility as sociologically significant. [...] <b>He</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> as challenge to the fear of miscegenation in the dying days of racial segregation in the United States. [...] Record producer Marshall Chess took a simpler view: [...] "It was sex.

500|$|With Castiel's now-weakened powers {{leaving him}} unable to heal injuries, {{being in a}} {{wheelchair}} begins to take its toll on Bobby. When the brothers come across a poker-playing witch in [...] "The Curious Case of Dean Winchester", <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> {{as a chance to}} regain his mobility and wagers 25 years of his lifespan. Although he loses and begins to age rapidly, Sam and Dean manage to restore his lost years. In [...] "Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid", Bobby's wife—and many other people buried in the local cemetery—suddenly rises from her grave and appears to be completely normal. Sam and Dean try to convince him to kill her because she is a zombie, but he refuses and orders them to leave. Over time, the other zombies begin to turn evil, and Bobby is forced to kill his wife again to prevent her from changing, too. After all the zombies are dealt with, Bobby reveals that Death orchestrated the situation; because {{he is one of the}} reasons why Sam has not yet agreed to be Lucifer's vessel, the Horseman attempted to break Bobby's spirit. Although Dean tries to comfort him by pointing out that he got to see his wife again, Bobby notes that it only made her death a thousand times worse.|$|E
500|$|The first thesis {{has become}} famous. It states, [...] "When our Lord and Master Jesus Christ said, 'Repent,' he willed the entire life of believers {{to be one}} of repentance." [...] In the first few theses Luther {{develops}} the idea of repentance as the Christian's inner struggle with sin rather than the external system of sacramental confession. Theses 5–7 then state that the pope can only release people from the punishments he has administered himself or through the church's system of penance, not the guilt of sin. The pope can only announce God's forgiveness of the guilt of sin in his name. In theses 14–29, Luther challenged common beliefs about purgatory. Theses 14–16 discuss the idea that the punishment of purgatory can be likened to the fear and despair felt by dying people. In theses 17–24 he asserts that nothing can be definitively said about the spiritual state of people in purgatory. He denies that the pope has any power over people in purgatory in theses 25 and 26. In theses 27–29, he attacks the idea that as soon as payment is made, the payer's loved one is released from purgatory. <b>He</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> as encouraging sinful greed, and says it is impossible to be certain because only God has ultimate power in forgiving punishments in purgatory.|$|E
500|$|Pamela and Bobby's {{relationship}} {{changed significantly}} {{as the show}} went on and began to progress. In order to create conflict, the producers brought in actors Priscilla Presley (Jenna Wade) and John Beck (Mark Graison) to cause drama for the couple. Eventually, the two characters divorced one another and went their separate ways. After becoming involved with Ewing oil, Bobby tended to put Pam on the backburner with the company coming first. In an interview with People, Principal said: [...] "I wouldn't {{put up with the}} way Pam is treated by Bobby." [...] She also added, [...] "Our marriage just doesn't work anymore and I want a divorce." [...] With the impending couple doomed, Pamela began a newfound relationship with Mark Graison (played by John Beck). The producers of Dallas were faced with the obstacle of getting the audience to root for a new love interest in Pam's life. When asked about the reception of his characters relationship with Pamela, Beck commented: [...] "It was always set up that way from the beginning, so it was quite a task and of course they came back together in the long run. I was just hoping for the best. I never got an extraordinary reaction from the public but it was everywhere, so constant recognition. It was pretty amazing but I never saw it the way <b>he</b> <b>sees</b> <b>it</b> but I can see his point of view. I never really looked at it like that." ...|$|E

[...] "Except a man be born again, <b>he</b> cannot <b>see</b> the kingdom of God." [...] Now unless he be born of God, <b>he</b> cannot <b>see</b> <b>it.</b> Suppose the kingdom of God be what <b>it</b> will, <b>he</b> cannot <b>see</b> <b>it</b> before <b>he</b> be begotten of God; suppose it be the Gospel, <b>he</b> cannot <b>see</b> <b>it</b> before <b>he</b> be brought {{into a state of}} regeneration; believing is the consequence of the new birth, [...] "not of blood, nor of the will of man, but of God." ...|$|R
