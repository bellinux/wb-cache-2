5|$|Bacteria used <b>for</b> <b>biological</b> control infect insects via their {{digestive}} tracts, so {{they offer}} only limited options for controlling insects with sucking mouth parts such as aphids and scale insects. Bacillus thuringiensis {{is the most}} widely applied species of bacteria used <b>for</b> <b>biological</b> control, with at least four sub-species used against Lepidopteran (moth, butterfly), Coleopteran (beetle) and Dipteran (true fly) insect pests. The bacterium is available to organic farmers in sachets of dried spores which are mixed with water and sprayed onto vulnerable plants such as brassicas and fruit trees. Genes from B. thuringiensis have also been incorporated into transgenic crops, making the plants express some of the bacterium's toxins, which are proteins. These confer resistance to insect pests and thus reduce the necessity for pesticide use. If pests develop resistance to the toxins in these crops, B. thuringiensis will become useless in organic farming also.|$|E
5|$|Few parasites and predators are {{effective}} <b>for</b> <b>biological</b> control of cockroaches. Parasitoidal wasps such as Ampulex wasps sting nerve ganglia in the cockroach's thorax, temporarily paralyzing the victim, allowing the wasp {{to deliver a}} second sting into the cockroach's brain. The wasp clips the antennae with its mandibles and drinks some hemolymph before dragging the prey to a burrow, where an egg is laid on it. The wasp larva feeds on the subdued living cockroach.|$|E

5|$|A base such as spermine {{has a few}} {{different}} {{sites where}} protonation can occur. In this example the first proton can go on the terminal –NH2 group, or either of the internal –NH– groups.

They cannot be determined directly by means of pH, absorbance, fluorescence or NMR measurements.

He helped found the Salk Institute <b>for</b> <b>Biological</b> Studies, where he became a resident fellow.

A 2011 report by the Center <b>for</b> <b>Biological</b> Diversity, {{a year after the}} April 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, said that 932 brown pelicans had been collected after being affected by oiling and estimated that ten times that number had been harmed {{as a result of the}} spill.|$|E

From the first meeting, ISMB has been held in locations worldwide; since 2007, meetings have been located in Europe and North America in alternating years. Since 2004, European meetings have been held jointly with the European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB).|$|E
5|$|Iron is {{involved}} in numerous biological processes. It {{is the most important}} transition metal in all living organisms. Iron-proteins are found in all living organisms: archaeans, bacteria and eukaryotes, including humans. For example, the color of blood is due to hemoglobin, an iron-containing protein. As illustrated by hemoglobin, iron is often bound to cofactors, such as hemes, which are non-protein compounds, often involving metal ions, that are required for a protein's biological activity to happen. The iron-sulfur clusters are pervasive and include nitrogenase, the enzymes responsible <b>for</b> <b>biological</b> nitrogen fixation. The main roles of iron-containing proteins are the transport and storage of oxygen, as well as the transfer of electrons.|$|E

They include mullein thrips (Haplothrips verbasci), Gymnaetron tetrum (whose larva consume the seeds) and the mullein moth (Cucullia verbasci). Useful insects are also hosted by great mullein, including predatory mites {{of the genera}} Galendromus, Typhlodromus and Amblyseius, the minute pirate bug Orius tristicolor and the mullein plant bug (Campylomma verbasci). The plant's ability to host both pests and beneficials makes it potentially useful to maintain stable populations of insects used <b>for</b> <b>biological</b> control in other cultures, like Campylomma verbasci and Dicyphus hesperus (Miridae), a predator of whiteflies. A number of pest Lepidoptera species, including the stalk borer (Papaipema nebris) and gray hairstreak (Strymon melinus), also use V.thapsus as a host plant.|$|E
