5|$|During {{his eight}} seasons {{playing for the}} Yokohama BayStars, Bobby Rose hit for three cycles, {{the most of any}} Nippon Professional Baseball player. Each spaced two seasons apart, his first cycle {{occurred}} on May 2, 1995, the next on April 29, 1997, and his final cycle on June 30, 1999. Other than Rose, only two NPB players <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> multiple cycles: Fumio Fujimura with the Osaka Tigers and Hiromi Matsunaga with the Hankyu/Orix Braves, both with two. Fujimura is also the only player to <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> a cycle during both the single league era and the current dual league era.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{especially}} controversial {{aspect of}} female perpetrated IPV is {{the theory of}} [...] "battered husband syndrome." [...] In light {{of the findings of}} the U.S. National Family Violence Survey in 1975, Suzanne K. Steinmetz wrote an article in 1977 in which she coined the term as a correlative to [...] "battered wife syndrome." [...] Steinmetz conducted several empirical investigations prior to writing her article. Using a broad-based non-representative sample of fifty-four couples, Steinmetz found male perpetrated IPV at a rate of 47% and female perpetrated IPV at a rate of 43%. She further found that while 39% of husbands had thrown objects, 31% of wives had done likewise; 31% of husbands had pushed or shoved their partner, compared to 32% of wives; 20% of husbands <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> their wives, 20% of wives <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> their husbands; 10% of husbands <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> their wives with an object, 10% of wives <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> their husbands with an object. In another study, using a sample of fifty-two Canadian college students, Steinmetz found male perpetrated IPV at a rate of 23% and female perpetrated IPV at a rate of 21%. Further investigation found that 21% of both husbands and wives had thrown objects; 17% of husbands had pushed or shoved, compared to 13% of wives; 13% of husbands <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> their wives, 13% of wives <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> their husbands; 10% of husbands <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> their wives with an object, 12% of wives <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> their husbands with an object. In a third study, using a random sample of ninety-four people, Steinmetz found male perpetrated IPV at a rate of 32% and female perpetrated IPV at a rate of 28%. Further investigation found that 31% of husbands had thrown objects compared to 25% of wives; 22% of husbands had pushed or shoved, compared to 18% of wives; 17% of husbands <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> their wives, 12% of wives <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> their husbands; 12% of husbands <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> their wives with an object, 14% of wives <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> their husbands with an object.|$|R

5|$|In other {{baseball}} leagues, {{the cycle}} is achieved less frequently. Through September 4, 2008, 63 players in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), the top-level baseball organization in Japan, <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> for the cycle, {{the most recent}} being Rainel Rosario. Two players <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> for the cycle {{on the same day}} once in NPB history; this has occurred twice in MLB history. One NPB player has also hit for the cycle in an NPB All-Star game. No player has ever hit for the cycle in the MLB All-Star Game or the postseason.|$|E
5|$|Reilly (1884), Tip O'Neill (1887), Herman (1931), and Aaron Hill (2012) are {{the only}} players in MLB history who <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> for the cycle twice in one season.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Patterson {{engaged in}} a gun duel with the Japanese column. Patterson {{received}} a shell hit aft, causing moderate damage and killing 10 crew members. Patterson continued to pursue and fire at the Japanese ships and may <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> Kinugasa, causing moderate damage. Patterson then {{lost sight of the}} Japanese column as it headed northeast along the eastern shore of Savo Island. Bagley, whose crew sighted the Japanese shortly after Patterson and Canberra, circled completely around to port before firing torpedoes {{in the general direction of}} the rapidly disappearing Japanese column; one or two of which may <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> Canberra. Bagley played no further role in the battle. Yūnagi exchanged non-damaging gunfire with Jarvis before exiting the battle area to the west with the intention of eventually rejoining the Japanese column north and west of Savo Island.|$|E

Since his first season in 2006, his 20 lead-off homers were the 6th-most behind Alfonso Soriano (31), Hanley Ramírez (25), Jimmy Rollins (24), Curtis Granderson (24), and Rickie Weeks (24).|$|E
5|$|Under weak {{steering}} currents while detached to the front, Diana drifted westward, {{and came}} within 50miles (85km) of the Florida coast. Rather than continuing westward, {{where it would}} <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> near Cape Canaveral, Diana turned to the northwest where it paralleled the coastline. The storm, continually strengthening over the Gulf Stream, turned to the northeast and became a hurricane on September 10. On September11 and September12, Diana rapidly intensified to a peak of 130mph (215km/h) winds while remaining offshore.|$|E
5|$|When Ochoa hit his cycle {{with the}} Chunichi Dragons on April 13, 2004, {{he became the}} only player to hit a cycle in both Major League Baseball and Nippon Professional Baseball. Eight years earlier, Ochoa had {{accomplished}} the same feat on July 3, 1996, while playing for MLB's New York Mets. Yakult Swallows catcher Atsuya Furuta is the only player to hit for the cycle in an NPB All-Star game, doing so in game 2 of the 1992 series. Inaba is the only player to hit for the cycle in a rain-shortened game. After hitting a triple {{in the first inning}} and hitting a home run in the fourth, Inaba collected the other two necessary hits in a seven-run fifth inning when the order batted around. Kosuke Fukudome is the only player to <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> a grand slam as the home run of the cycle. Hiroshi Ohshita and Kazuhiko Kondo are the only two players to <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> a walk-off home run to win the game as the final hit of their cycles.|$|E

5|$|A New Jersey {{hurricane}} is {{a tropical}} cyclone {{originating in the}} Atlantic Ocean that affects the state of New Jersey. Due to its location, few hurricanes <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> the state directly, though numerous hurricanes have passed near or through New Jersey in its history. About every 10years, hurricanes approach the coastline close enough to send waves over barrier islands' dunes and into back bays. According to an estimate by meteorologist George Prouflis, the chances for a direct hit by a hurricane on the Jersey shore each year is 1 in 200.|$|E
5|$|As a {{workaround}} many {{policy makers}} try to restore competitiveness through internal devaluation, a painful economic adjustment process, where a country aims {{to reduce its}} unit labour costs. German economist Hans-Werner Sinn noted in 2012 that Ireland was the only country that had implemented relative wage moderation {{in the last five}} years, which helped decrease its relative price/wage levels by 16%. Greece would need to bring this figure down by 31%, effectively reaching the level of Turkey. By 2012, wages in Greece have been cut to a level last seen in the late 1990s. Purchasing power dropped even more to the level of 1986. Similarly, wages in Italy <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> a 25-year low and consumption has fallen to the level of 1950.|$|E
5|$|Hutton and Washbrook {{took the}} score to 42England's highest opening {{partnership}} of the seriesbefore the former edged Lindwall to Johnson in the slips {{and was out}} for 13. Soon after, Edrich edged to Johnson low down in the cordon and England were 2/52. Edrich decided to stand his ground after the catch was taken, thinking he may <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> a bump ball into the ground, but the umpire thought otherwise and ruled him out. Johnson had little else to do as the pacemen made steady progress on a seaming pitch. He bowled only two overs for three runs as England fell for 186, handing Australia victory by 409 runs and a 20 series lead.|$|E

5|$|In Major League Baseball (MLB), the 500 {{home run}} club {{is a group}} of batters who <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> 500 or more regular-season home runs in their careers. On August 11, 1929, Babe Ruth became the first member of the club. Ruth ended his career with 714 home runs, a record which stood from 1935 until Hank Aaron surpassed it in 1974. Aaron's {{ultimate}} career total, 755, remained the record until Barry Bonds set the current mark of 762 during the 2007 season. Twenty-seven players are members of the 500 home run club. Ted Williams (.344) holds the highest batting average among the club members while Harmon Killebrew (.256) holds the lowest.|$|E

5|$|The most cycles hit by {{a player}} in Nippon Professional Baseball is three, {{accomplished}} by Bobby Rose. Playing for the Yokohama BayStars, Rose hit his first cycle on May 2, 1995, the next on April 29, 1997, and his final cycle on June 30, 1999. Other than Rose, only three other NPB players <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> multiple cycles: Fumio Fujimura with the Osaka Tigers and Hiromi Matsunaga with the Hankyu/Orix Braves and Kosuke Fukudome with the Chunichi Dragons and the Hanshin Tigers, all with two. Fujimura is also the only player to <b>have</b> <b>hit</b> a cycle during both the single league era and the current dual league era. The 2003 NPB season saw the most cycles hit in a single season—five. That season also saw the only instance of cycles occurring in two different games on the same day: on July 1, hit by Atsunori Inaba of the Yakult Swallows and Arihito Muramatsu of the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks. The next day, Shinjiro Hiyama became the third player to hit for the cycle in two days. Conversely, the longest period of time between two players hitting for the cycle is one day shy of 6years.
