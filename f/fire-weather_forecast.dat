40|$|In {{the summer}} of 1957, {{short-term}} weather surveys were made in four prescribed burn areas in the central Sierra Nevada foothills and in the central Coast Range in California The local fireclimate patterns were studied, a <b>fire-weather</b> <b>forecast</b> was adapted to the burn area for each fire, and {{attempts were made to}} note the effects of the fires on the fireclimate patterns. This paper describes the survey techniques used, gives an example of a forecast, and discusses some of the survey results. The latter include an increase in wind speed blowing out of the lee side of the fire, effects of the broadscale weather OII the local patterns, down-canyon afternoon winds in east-facing canyons, and temperature observations and topographic effect,s 011 the lee side of a ridge. 1...|$|E
40|$|Probability terms, {{especially}} {{in relation to}} precipitation occurrence, were incorporated in <b>fire-weather</b> <b>forecasts</b> on a trial basis in the Chicago District during the 1952 <b>fire-weather</b> seasons. These <b>forecasts</b> were verified {{in an attempt to}} determine whether or not such subjective estima. tes of probability were feasible. Results show that forecasters have some skill in assessing the probability of the occurrence of precipitation especially for the first 30 hours...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The 1910 fires, which burned {{more than}} 1. 3 million ha of {{northern}} Rocky Mountain forests, provided a mission and management objectives {{for the newly}} created Forest Service. By 1911, the Priest River Experimental Station (Forest-PREF) was established in northern Idaho to help {{meet the needs of}} the Forest Ser-vice. Harry T. Gisborne, whose work was centered at PREF, proved to be one, if not the most influential and far-seeing fire researcher in the history of the Forest Service. Examples of his contributions include the fire danger rating system, fuel moisture sticks, short- and long-term specialized <b>fire-weather</b> <b>forecasting,</b> and the beginnings of predicting fire behavior. After Gisborne’s death in 1949, Jack Bar-rows, one of Gisborne’s assistants, led the fire program and introduced high-tech approaches to fire research. Barrows was instrumental in creating the state-of-the-art Fire Sciences Laboratory in Missoula, Montana. The McSweeney–McNary Act (1928) laid the groundwork for a nationwide system of forest experiment stations and experimental forests, and in 1933 Deception Creek (DCEF) and Boise Basin Experimental Forests (BBEF) were established. DCEF was located in a productiv...|$|R
