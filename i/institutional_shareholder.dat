5|$|After Icos's {{experimental}} drugs {{failed in}} clinical trials, Eli Lilly {{was in a}} prime position to purchase the company. In October2006, Eli Lilly announced that it had reached terms to acquire Icos for $2.1billion, or $32 a share. After receiving pressure from large institutional shareholders as well as proxy advisory firm <b>Institutional</b> <b>Shareholder</b> Services (ISS) suggesting the deal should be rejected, Lilly increased its offer to $2.3billion or $34 per share, a 6% increase. Again, resistance was voiced by some large shareholders, and ISS advised shareholders against accepting the new offer, which it still deemed insufficient. On January 25, 2007, at a special meeting, 77% of the shareholders voted {{in support of the}} acquisition. Eli Lilly closed the transaction to acquire Icos for $2.3billion on January29, 2007.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 1990s, the issue of {{corporate}} governance in the U.S. received considerable press attention due to a spate of CEO dismissals (for example, at IBM, Kodak, and Honeywell) by their boards. The California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) led a wave of <b>institutional</b> <b>shareholder</b> activism (something only very rarely seen before), as a way of ensuring that corporate value would not be destroyed by the now traditionally cozy relationships between the CEO and the board of directors (for example, by the unrestrained issuance of stock options, not infrequently back-dated).|$|E

40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} the role that <b>institutional</b> <b>shareholders</b> play in acquisition decision using micro data in the Chinese stock market during 2003 - 2008. Acquisition decision is the selection and coordination process of shareholders as strategic alliances, which is determined by corporate acquisition ability, composition of <b>institutional</b> <b>shareholders</b> and concentration of tradable share (TS) in China. We use Heckman selection model to surmount the selection biases in acquisition decision. We find that <b>institutional</b> <b>shareholders</b> including qualified foreign institutional investors (QFII), social security funds (SSF), security firms (SF) and security investment funds (SIF), as well as TS concentration affect acquisition probability rather than annual acquisition scale. SSF, SIF and TS concentration can increase acquisition probability while QFII decreases it. Our paper contributes to the published literature in three ways. First, we offer a model to understand the selection and coordination process of acquisition decision. Second, we investigate whether <b>institutional</b> <b>shareholders</b> could effectively monitor annual acquisition scale. Third, we identify Heckman selection problem that <b>institutional</b> <b>shareholders</b> could affect PLCs’ acquisition {{decision on whether to}} acquire rather than how much to acquire. ...|$|R
25|$|In 1998, Eli Lilly {{formed a}} joint venture with Icos Corporation (ICOS), a Bothell, Washington-based {{biotechnology}} company, to develop and commercialize Cialis, a product for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. In October 2006, Lilly announced its intention to acquire Icos for $2.1 billion, or $32 per share. After its initial attempt to acquire Icos failed under pressure from large institutional shareholders, Lilly revised its offer to $34 per share. <b>Institutional</b> <b>Shareholder</b> Services (ISS), a proxy advisory firm, advised Icos shareholders to reject the proposal as undervalued, but the buyout was approved by Icos shareholders and Lilly completed its acquisition of the company on January 29, 2007. Lilly closed Icos manufacturing operations, terminated nearly 500 Icos employees, and left 127 employees working at the biologics facility. In December 2007, CMC Biopharmaceuticals A/S (CMC), a Copenhagen, Denmark-based provider of contract biomanufacturing services, bought the Bothell-based biologics facility from Lilly and retained the existing 127 employees.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the preferences of}} institutional investors for firm policies {{and the relationship between}} these preferences and firm decisions. I find that institutions exhibit systematic differences in their preferences for financial and investment policies of the firms they invest in. Furthermore, these preferences are related to subsequent changes in the financial and investment policies of firms. In particular, a firm is more likely to decrease (increase) its leverage ratio if its current leverage is higher (lower) than the preferences of its <b>institutional</b> <b>shareholders.</b> A firm is also more likely to increase (decrease) its investment if its current investment ratio is lower (higher) than the revealed preferences of its <b>institutional</b> <b>shareholders.</b> Overall, the evidence in this paper suggests that the preferences of <b>institutional</b> <b>shareholders</b> are an important determinant of corporate policies...|$|R

Corporate Governance has been developed to solve the agency dilemma that exists in modern corporations.

An important role is played by <b>institutional</b> <b>shareholders.</b> The main thesis of this paper is that preventive governance {{is the best way to}} solve the agency dilemma and <b>institutional</b> <b>shareholders</b> have learned the importance of it. Key words: corporate governance, institutional investors, preventive governance, agency dilemma, codes of best practices.

40|$|Agency theory {{would predict}} that, given the {{presence}} of large or powerful shareholders in a company, agency costs would be reduced. Excessive executive compensation {{can be regarded as}} being an externality problem that stems from the agency problem. Agency theory would also then predict that executives in companies with large shareholders would receive less compensation and a larger proportion of long-term incentive-based compensation than companies with smaller shareholders. The validity of these two hypotheses has been tested using a unique cross-sectional, time series dataset and two statistical techniques. The first set of tests involve the construction of multiple regression models in order to provide evidence as to whether Chief Executive Officer (CEO) compensation is affected by <b>institutional</b> <b>shareholders.</b> The second method, using statistical tests of differences between means, involves separating the sample into two sub-samples, namely management- and owner-controlled firms, to ascertain whether these two groups remunerate their CEOs differently to each other, thus testing the hypotheses in an alternative manner to the regression models. This report examines whether {{the presence of}} <b>institutional</b> <b>shareholders</b> affects the level and mix of CEO compensation for 50 companies listed on the JSE Securities Exchange over the five-year period 2002 - 2006. Original findings on the value of share options awarded to CEOs are presented, along with the trends in the level and mix of CEO compensation. Further research findings also include trends in the level of institutional ownership of listed companies over this period. The results of both the regression models and tests for differences of means provide statistical evidence in support of the assertion that the presence of <b>institutional</b> <b>shareholders</b> do not have an effect on either the level or mix of CEO compensation. Suggested reasons for this result range from shareholder apathy, to not considering executive remuneration to be a significant enough issue for <b>institutional</b> <b>shareholders,</b> and finally to the suggestion that <b>institutional</b> <b>shareholders</b> perceive the level and mix of compensation paid to South African CEOs to be a fair reflection of their value to their company...|$|R
