40|$|Determination of {{original}} state <b>of</b> stress in <b>rock</b> mass {{is a very}} difficult task for rock mechanics. Yet, original state <b>of</b> stress in <b>rock</b> mass has fundamental influence on secondary state of stress, which occurs in the vicinity of mining headings. This, in turn, is the cause of the occurrence of a number of mining hazards, i. e., seismic events, rock bursts, gas and <b>rock</b> outbursts, falls <b>of</b> roof. From experience, it is known that original state of stress depends a lot on tectonic disturbances, i. e., faults and folds. In the area of faults, a great number of seismic events occur, often of high energies. These seismic events, in many cases, are the cause <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> bursts and damage to the constructions located inside the rock mass and {{on the surface of the}} ground. To estimate the influence of fault existence on the disturbance {{of original}} state <b>of</b> stress in <b>rock</b> mass, numerical calculations were done by means of Finite Element Method. In the calculations, it was tried to determine the influence of different factors on state of stress, which occurs in the vicinity of a normal fault, i. e., the influence of normal fault inclination, deformability <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> mass, values <b>of</b> friction coefficient on the fault contact. Critical value of friction coefficient was also determined, when mutual <b>dislocation</b> <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> mass part separated by a fault is impossible. The obtained results enabled formulation of a number of conclusions, which are important in the context of seismic events and rock bursts in the area of faults...|$|R
60|$|Mark {{knew that}} {{there must have been}} a <b>dislocation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rocks,</b> to produce such a change as that he saw to the southward. It was well for him it {{occurred}} there at a distance, as he then thought, of ten or fifteen miles from the Reef, though in truth it was at quite fifty, instead of happening beneath him. It was possible, however, for one to have been on the top of that mountain, and to have lived through the late change, could the lungs of man have breathed the atmosphere. Not far from this mountain a column of smoke rose out of the sea, and Mark fancied that, at moments, he could discern the summit of an active crater at its base.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Fracture - <b>dislocations</b> <b>of</b> the talus are {{typically}} {{due to high}} energy injuries. Displaced fracture - <b>dislocations</b> <b>of</b> the talus have poor outcomes in general and complications are common. Although talar fracture is common and comprises {{the second most common}} tarsal fracture, bilateral fracture - <b>dislocations</b> <b>of</b> the talus are rare.

Case Presentation: We report a patient with bilateral fracture - <b>dislocations</b> <b>of</b> the talus treated by open reduction and internal fixation. This patient was a 25 year-old man who sustained bilateral fracture - <b>dislocation</b> <b>of</b> the talus due to a motor vehicle accident.

40|$|Introduction: A new {{mechanism}} of injury of the forearm bones, crisscross injury, is described. It is more common than the Essex-Lopresti fracture dislocation. The old concept of isolated injury of {{one side of the}} radioulnar joint may be challenged. It often occurs in Mason type II fracture <b>dislocation</b> <b>of</b> the radial head or <b>dislocation</b> <b>of</b> radioulnar joints. Materials and methods: The first part was a cadaveric study of the crisscross injury of forearms. The second part was a clinical study of the crisscross injury in some cases of Mason type II fracture radial head and double <b>dislocation</b> <b>of</b> the radioulnar joint. Results: The cadaveric study confirmed a stable crisscross fracture dislocation injury with intact interosseous membrane. The clinical study echoed the presence of this injury by imaging techniques. Conclusion: The crisscross injury mechanism explains the mirror pathogenesis of the traumatic fracture <b>dislocation</b> <b>of</b> the distal and proximal radioulnar joints with intact shaft of the radius and ulna. Co-existing subluxation or <b>dislocation</b> <b>of</b> the other radioulnar articulation must not be overlooked in cases <b>of</b> fracture <b>dislocation</b> <b>of</b> one radioulnar joint. Two types of crisscross injury of forearm bones are proposed. © Springer-Verlag 2005. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Four {{cases of}} brachial-artery {{disruption}} associated with <b>dislocation</b> <b>of</b> the elbow are reported. Anatomical studies demonstrated {{disruption of the}} in-ferior ulnar collateral-anterior ulnar recurrent anastomotic loop when posterior dis-location of the elbow occurred. On {{the basis of these}} studies, brachial-artery repair is advocated when a <b>dislocation</b> <b>of</b> the elbow is accompanied by brachial-artery dis-ruption. <b>Dislocation</b> <b>of</b> the elbow is a relatively common traumatic injury 15 #{ 149 }Although the majority are closed injuries, nine cases <b>of</b> open <b>dislocation</b> <b>of</b> the elbow have been re-ported since 1900 9, 14, 15. 19. 26, 29 In eight of these cases the brachial artery was disrupted.

40|$|Dorsal {{traumatic}} <b>dislocation</b> <b>of</b> metatarsophalangeal {{joint of}} great toe {{is a rare}} injury. Ability to reduce the dislocation by nonoperative measures depends largely on the type <b>of</b> <b>dislocation</b> and involvement <b>of</b> the sesamoid complex. There are three basic types <b>of</b> <b>dislocations.</b> Type I cases are usually irreducible on closed reduction, the metatarsal head being incarcerated by the conjoined tendons with their intact sesamoids. In type II, the sesamoid complex disruption usually pemits closed reduction. We present an irreducible <b>dislocation</b> <b>of</b> the first metatarsophalangeal joint with fibular sesamoid fracture in an 80 -year-old man. In addition, he had a concomitant dorsal <b>dislocation</b> <b>of</b> the second MTP of the same foot, to our knowledge only one case with this injury {{was reported in the}} literature...|$|R
