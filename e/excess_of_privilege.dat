40|$|Includes abstract. Located in {{the college}} novel tradition, Close to Home explores {{a number of the}} themes common to the sub-genre, {{specifically}} the ennui of university students from a wealthy background. The story's characters have an <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> money, <b>privilege</b> and leisure time, which leads to boredom and ultimate tragedy. The protagonist, Faye, epitomises the stereotype of a spoiled Cape Town girl- a personality that turns out to {{have a lot in common}} with the magnetic but ultimately dangerous characters of some of the best-known college novels...|$|R

This conveniently-blind representative saw the scow receive a number which was far in <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> its <b>privilege,</b> and winked a politic wink and said nothing. The passengers bore with meekness the cheat which had been put upon them, and made no complaint.|$|R
50|$|The {{political}} issue of VFAs {{is complicated by}} the fact that many host countries have mixed feelings about foreign troops on their soil, and demands to renegotiate the VFA are often combined with calls for foreign troops to leave entirely. Issues of different national customs can arise. Many U.S. observers, for example, feel that host country justice systems grant a much weaker set of protections to the accused than the U.S. and that host country courts can be subject to popular pressure to deliver a guilty verdict; furthermore, that American servicemembers ordered to a foreign posting should not be forced to give up the rights they are afforded under the United States Bill of Rights. On the other hand, host country observers having no local counterpart to the Bill of Rights often feel that this is an irrelevant excuse for demanding special treatment, and resembles the extraterritorial agreements demanded by Western countries during the colonial era. One host country where such sentiment is widespread, South Korea, itself has forces in Kyrgyzstan and has negotiated a SOFA that confers total immunity to its servicemembers from prosecution by Kyrgyz authorities for any crime whatsoever, something far in <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> the <b>privileges</b> many South Koreans object to in their nation's SOFA with the U.S.|$|R

40|$|Many lawyers {{believe that}} ethical duties of {{confidentiality}} and zealousness {{require them to}} assert attorney-client privilege as aggressively as they assert a criminal defendant’s lack of guilt. They treat client information {{as if it is}} “privileged until proven unprivileged,” even though it is the claimant <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> that has the evidentiary burden of showing that all the legal elements <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> are met. Ordinarily, the adversary system works well to expose and control frivolous claims, but challenges to frivolous claims <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> face unique obstacles. Challengers must operate “in the dark,” without the detailed knowledge of the communication needed to determine whether it really is privileged and whether its strategic value justifies the expense of opposition. This has made it easy and advantageous for lawyers to make frivolous claims <b>of</b> attorney-client <b>privilege,</b> despite the threat of court-imposed sanctions. Such abusive claims <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> decrease the quality of justice by preventing consideration of relevant evidence and increase the cost of litigation by forcing expensive collateral litigation around privilege claims. The strategic advantage of frivolous claims <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> combined with the inadequacy of the adversary system to discover and sanction such claims suggests that the rules of ethics could serve as a counter-balance. Yet, our existing ethical rules actually seem to encourage lawyers to make frivolous, “knee-jerk” claims <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> by emphasizing the ethical duties of confidentiality and zealous representation. Against this, I argue that a limit to claims <b>of</b> attorney-client <b>privilege</b> should be understood as implicit in the existing Model Rules <b>of</b> Attorney-Client <b>Privilege</b> and that explicit ethical limits of the kind proposed in the article will not undermine confidentiality. However, an effective ethical limit requires that useful guidance about what constitutes a frivolous claim <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> can be provided. I condense an analysis of cases in which lawyers have been either legally sanctioned or ethically disciplined for making such claims into a proposed added Comment to Model Rule 3. 1 (Meritorious Claims and Contentions) ...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{challenges}} in educating about issues <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> {{have been documented}} in the academic literature. To address many of those challenges, this paper outlines a pedagogical model that combines a modified form of intergroup dialogue, called cross-privilege dialogue, with single identity caucusing to engage participants in exploring their personal embodiment <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> and their barriers to engaging in ally behavior. The paper identifies specific issues that arose in implementing the pedagogy and theorizes a process from resistance to praxis that combines critical self-awareness with action to assist students in {{understanding the importance of}} both. 2 While the academic community has focused increasing attention on issues <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> {{in the last couple of}} decades (Manglitz, 2003; Ore, 2006), most of the writing has focused on defining various forms <b>of</b> <b>privilege</b> and how those forms function to maintain inequality (Goodman, 2001...|$|R
