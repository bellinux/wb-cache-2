500|$|After a courtship, Gillis and White {{got married}} on September 21, 1996; {{contrary}} to convention, {{he took his}} wife's surname. Shortly after, Goober and the Peas broke up, but Jack continued to play in other bands, such as the garage punk band The Go (he played lead guitar on their 1999 album Whatcha Doin'), The Hentchmen, and Two-Star Tabernacle. In 1997—allegedly on Bastille Day—Meg first began {{to learn to play}} the drums. In Jack's words, [...] "When she started to play drums with me, <b>just</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> lark, it felt liberating and refreshing. There was something in it that opened me up." [...] The couple then became a band and, while they considered calling themselves [...] "Bazooka" [...] and [...] "Soda Powder", they settled on the name [...] "The White Stripes". Jack explained the band name's origin this way: ...|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{controversy}} surrounding the game, it was approved for release in Germany and Australia, countries that are known to ban explicit video games. Producer John Williamson stated in an interview, [...] "I thought, just based on everything I always read online, {{that it would never}} get through, but it went through on the first pass." [...] Williamson attempted to justify the release of the game by noting the intellectual elements of both the game and the film franchise. He pointed out: I think they reviewed the game based on everything that was in it, not <b>just</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> couple of minutes of it, just like the Saw movies themselves aren't really pure torture porn. If you pay attention, there's actually usually a big twist in them. He went on to comment that the Saw films would not continue to appeal to fans if they were stereotypical torture porn.|$|E
500|$|Musically, {{the band}} {{regarded}} the album as a 'new progression'. Bassist Nathan Cochran said that [...] "It’s not a sharp left turn; it’s a step beyond what we’ve ever done. We feel like our message and calling are the same... We’re still worship leaders; we’re <b>just</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> different scale". As a whole, Undone is a guitar-driven album with a pop rock and adult contemporary sound. The album's opening track, [...] "Where You Lead Me", builds from an acoustic guitar-driven opening into a crescendo featuring synthesizers and guitars. [...] "Here with Me" [...] has a musical vibe similar to alternative rock band Coldplay. [...] "Homesick" [...] is a ballad featuring strings from the London Symphony Orchestra. More upbeat cuts {{on the album}} include [...] "In The Blink Of An Eye", [...] "Caught Up In The Middle", and [...] "A Million Miles Away", while [...] "Keep Singing" [...] is driven by a piano.|$|E

500|$|A March 1969 {{meeting between}} Slayton, George Low, Bob Gilruth, and Chris Kraft {{determined}} that Armstrong {{would be the}} first person on the Moon, in some part because NASA management saw Armstrong as a person who did not have a large ego. A press conference held on April 14, 1969, gave the design of the LM cabin as the reason for Armstrong's being first; the hatch opened inwards and to the right, making it difficult for the lunar module pilot, on the right-hand side, to exit first. Slayton added, [...] "Secondly, <b>just</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> pure protocol basis, I figured the commander ought to be the first guy out... I changed it as soon as I found they had the time line that showed that. Bob Gilruth approved my decision." [...] At the time of their meeting, the four men did not know about the hatch consideration. The first knowledge of the meeting outside the small group came when Kraft wrote his 2001 autobiography.|$|E
500|$|The {{project would}} soon head off in more {{productive}} directions, largely impelled by a trip of Edison's to Europe and the Exposition Universelle in Paris, {{for which he}} departed August 2 or 3, 1889. During his two months abroad, Edison visited with scientist-photographer Étienne-Jules Marey, who had devised a [...] "chronophotographic gun"—the first portable motion picture camera—which used a strip of flexible film designed to capture sequential images at twelve frames per second. Upon {{his return to the}} United States, Edison filed another patent caveat, on November 2, which described a Kinetoscope based not <b>just</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> flexible filmstrip, but one in which the film was perforated to allow for its engagement by sprockets, making its mechanical conveyance much more smooth and reliable. The first motion picture system to employ a perforated image band was apparently the Théâtre Optique, patented by French inventor Charles-Émile Reynaud in 1888. Reynaud's system did not use photographic film, but images painted on gelatine frames. At the Exposition Universelle, Edison would have seen both the Théâtre Optique and the electrical tachyscope of German inventor Ottamar Anschütz. This disc-based projection device {{is often referred to as}} an important conceptual source for the development of the Kinetoscope. Its crucial innovation was to take advantage of the persistence of vision theory by using an intermittent light source to momentarily [...] "freeze" [...] the projection of each image; the goal was to facilitate the viewer's retention of many minutely different stages of a photographed activity, thus producing a highly effective illusion of constant motion. By late 1890, intermittent visibility would be integral to the Kinetoscope's design.|$|E

2500|$|At 19 years old, Jack {{had landed}} his first {{professional}} gig as the drummer for the Detroit band Goober & the Peas, {{and was still}} in that position when the band broke up in 1996.

2500|$|According to Salk: [...] "My {{intention}} {{was to go to}} medical school, and then become a medical scientist.

I had opportunities along the way to drop the idea of medicine and go into science. At one point {{at the end of my}} first year of medical school, I received an opportunity to spend a year in research and teaching in biochemistry, which I did. And at the end of that year, I was told that I could, if I wished, switch and get a Ph.D. in biochemistry, but my preference was to stay with medicine. And, I believe that this is all linked to my original ambition, or desire, which was to be of some help to humankind, so to speak, in a larger sense than <b>just</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> one-to-one basis." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{estimates}} for the sizes of the opposing armies are often in dispute. It is certain that all contemporary and near-contemporary sources (or at least those that have survived), consider the Mongols {{to have been the}} numerically superior force. Several chroniclers, a notable one being Rashid Al-Din (a historian of the Ilkhanate) provide the figures of 400,000 for the Shah (spread across the whole empire) and 600,000 or 700,000 for the Khan. The Ilkhanate historian Juvayni, in his Tarikh-i Jahangushay, also gives a Mongol army size of 700,000. 800,000 for Genghis was claimed by the contemporary Muslim chronicler Minhaj-i-Siraj Juzjani. Modern historians still debate to what degree these numbers reflected reality. David Morgan and Denis Sinor, among others, doubt the numbers are true in either absolute or relative terms, while John Mason Smith sees the numbers as accurate as for both armies (while supporting high-end numbers for the Mongols and their enemies in general, for instance contending that Rashid Al-Din was correct when stating that the Ilkhanate of the 1260s had 300,000 soldiers and the Golden Horde 300,000-600,000). [...] Sinor uses the figure of 400,000 for the Khwarezmians, but puts the Mongol force at 150,000. The Secret History of the Mongols, a Mongol source, states that the Mongols had 105,000 soldiers total (in the whole empire, not <b>just</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> campaign) in 1206, 134,500 in 1211, and 129,000 (excluding some far-flung units) in 1227. No similarly reliable source exists for corresponding Kwharezm figures.|$|E
2500|$|Three members (Garred, Pritchard and Harris) of The Kooks all met as {{students}} at the BRIT School in Croydon, all three moving further south to join BIMM (where they met Rafferty who was from Brighton) in 2002. The inspiration to form a band came to Pritchard as he and Garred were out shopping for clothes one day in Primark as a joke. Speaking to MTV Garred said, [...] "we had a vision on how we wanted the band to look and stuff—so we bought some clothes and these hats, it was fun." [...] Sharing a love of The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, The Police, and David Bowie, Pritchard got Harris and Rafferty involved {{under the guise of}} a school music project. Pritchard himself said [...] "We got together <b>just</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> whim, really." [...] With a strong demo of their material Garred and Pritchard went in search of a gig, and according to Garred, they were able to book their first show simply because the landlord liked their hats. [...] "So we went in to get a gig, we don't have a demo blid burnt, and this guy told us, 'Well, you can't get a gig if you don't have a demo, but I like your hats, so I'm {{going to give you a}} gig'", said Garred.

This seemed a fatal procedure, but I was willing to try anything. My hope of getting a strike was exceedingly slim.
