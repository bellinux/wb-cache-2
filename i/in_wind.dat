5|$|Typically, {{if there}} is little wind shear, the storm will rapidly enter the dissipating stage and 'rain itself out', but, {{if there is}} {{sufficient}} change <b>in</b> <b>wind</b> speed and/or direction, the downdraft will {{be separated from the}} updraft, and the storm may become a supercell, where the mature stage can sustain itself for several hours.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{influence}} of a strong mid-level ridge over northern Mexico, the depression moved northwestward into an area of moderate northeasterly vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures. By 06:00UTC on September6, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Linda. Due to a decrease <b>in</b> <b>wind</b> shear, Linda began to undergo rapid deepening shortly thereafter. Between that day and early on September7, the storm increased in convective banding and developed central dense overcast; satellite imagery also indicated that an eye was forming around that time. At 06:00UTC on September7, Linda intensified into a Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Just six hours later, the cyclone reached Category2 status. Due to a slight increase <b>in</b> <b>wind</b> shear and possibly an intrusion from dry air, Linda temporarily remained steady in intensity while passing between Socorro Island and Clarion Island. Operationally, the NHC briefly downgraded Linda to a Category 1 hurricane at 0:300UTC on September8, though post-analysis concludes that the storm remained a Category2.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear {{can also}} create wave. This occurs when an {{atmospheric}} inversion separates two layers with a marked difference <b>in</b> <b>wind</b> direction.

5|$|Wind shear, {{sometimes}} referred to as windshear or wind gradient, is a difference <b>in</b> <b>wind</b> speed and direction over a relatively short distance in the Earth's atmosphere. Wind shear can be broken down into vertical and horizontal components, with horizontal wind shear seen across weather fronts and near the coast, and vertical shear typically near the surface, though also at higher levels in the atmosphere near upper level jets and frontal zones aloft.|$|E
5|$|By September 28, the {{organization}} of the depression deteriorated further due to strong vertical wind shear. The center of the depression again became difficult to location by infrared images early on September 29. Later that day, a few computer models indicated a decrease <b>in</b> <b>wind</b> shear over the depression within two days, thus, it was predicted to strengthen into a tropical storm. However, wind shear exposed the center of the depression again by early on September 30, though it was still forecast to intensify to tropical storm status. By late on October 1, satellite imagery noted that the depression dissipated, and the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory on the system.|$|E
5|$|Early on September 21, {{the motion}} {{shifted to the}} north as it moved along the {{northwest}} periphery of the subtropical ridge. That general motion continued throughout the day, however, Helene began to turn more northeastward that evening {{along the edge of}} the subtropical ridge, east of Bermuda. A decrease <b>in</b> <b>wind</b> shear and relatively warm water around 81°F (27°C) kept the intensity mostly stationary, keeping Helene as a Category1 hurricane. The intensity held around 80mph (130km/h) before strengthening slightly late on September 22, despite losing some tropical characteristics (it was operationally downgraded to a tropical storm for a brief period) as it accelerated northeast in the north Atlantic. A QuikSCAT analysis early on September 23 confirmed a high-end Category1 hurricane with 90mph (145km/h) winds.|$|E

5|$|However, {{because the}} planet is {{rotating}} underneath the atmosphere, and frictional forces arise as the planetary surface drags some atmosphere with it, the air flow from center to periphery is not direct, but is twisted due to the Coriolis effect, or the merely apparent force that arise when the observer is in a rotating frame of reference.

5|$|Shortly after {{reaching}} peak intensity, a sharp increase <b>in</b> <b>wind</b> shear caused Emilia to weaken quickly to winds of 50mph (85km/h). Operationally, the NHC initially continued {{to assess the}} storm as with winds of 70mph (115m/h), with hurricane status predicted. However, the decrease in strength became evident on July 24, when dry air became entrained in the circulation; at the same time, the convection became limited to the southern semicircle of the storm. On July 25, the wind shear decreased as the storm turned toward the Baja California peninsula, despite that tropical cyclones affecting the Baja California peninsula {{in the month of}} July are rare. Convection increased in coverage, and an eye feature re-appeared early on July 26 as it again attained peak winds of 65mph (105km/h).|$|E

5|$|Sound {{movement}} {{through the atmosphere}} is affected by wind shear, which can bend the wave front, causing sounds to be heard where they normally would not, or vice versa.
