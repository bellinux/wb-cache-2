40|$|<b>Double</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs {{could be}} {{important}} sources for space based gravitational wave detectors like OMEGA and LISA. We use population synthesis {{to predict the}} current population of <b>double</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs in the Galaxy and the gravitational waves produced by this population. We simulate a detailed power spectrum for an observation with an integration time of 10 ^ 6 s. At frequencies below ~ 3 mHz confusion limited noise dominates. At higher frequencies a few thousand <b>double</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs are resolved individually. Including compact binaries containing neutron stars and black holes in our calculations yields a further few hundred resolved binaries and some tens which can be detected above the <b>double</b> <b>white</b> dwarf noise at low frequencies. We find that binaries in which one white dwarf transfers matter to another white dwarf are rare, and thus unimportant for gravitational wave detectors. We discuss the uncertainties and compare our results with other authors.

At frequencies below f ~< 2 mHz the <b>double</b> <b>white</b> dwarf population forms an unresolved background for the low-frequency gravitational wave detector LISA. Above this limit some few thousand <b>double</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs and few tens of binaries containing neutron stars will be resolved.

40|$|The {{study of}} Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) has lead to greatly {{improved}} insights into many fields in astrophysics, however a theoretical {{explanation of the}} origin of these events is still lacking. We investigate the potential contribution to the SNIa rate from the population of merging <b>double</b> carbon-oxygen <b>white</b> dwarfs. We aim to develope a model that fits the observed SNIa progenitors as well as the observed close <b>double</b> <b>white</b> dwarf population. We differentiate between two scenarios for the common envelope (CE) evolution; the alpha-formalism based on the energy equation and the gamma-formalism that is based on the angular momentum equation. In one model we apply the alpha-formalism always. In the second model the gamma-formalism is applied, unless the binary contains a compact object or the CE is triggered by a tidal instability for which the alpha-formalism is used. The binary population synthesis code SeBa was used to evolve binary systems from the zero-age main sequence to the formation of <b>double</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs and subsequent mergers. SeBa has been thoroughly updated since the last publication of the content of the code. The limited sample of observed <b>double</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs is better represented by the simulated population using the gamma-formalism than the alpha-formalism. For both CE formalisms, we find that although the morphology of the simulated delay time distribution matches that of the observations within the errors, the normalisation and time-integrated rate per stellar mass are a factor 7 - 12 lower than observed. Furthermore, the characteristics of the simulated populations of merging <b>double</b> carbon-oxygen <b>white</b> dwarfs are discussed and put in the context of alternative SNIa models for merging <b>double</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs.

40|$|Abstract. We {{model the}} {{population}} of <b>double</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs in the Galaxy and find a better agreement with observations compared to earlier studies, due to two modifications. The first is {{the treatment of the}} first phase of unstable mass transfer and the second the modelling of the cooling of the white dwarfs. A satisfactory agreement with observations of the local sample of white dwarfs is achieved if we assume that the initial binary fraction is ∼ 50 % and that the lowest mass white dwarfs (M < 0. 3 M⊙) cool faster than the most recently published cooling models predict. With this model we find a Galactic birth rate of close <b>double</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs of 0. 05 yr − 1,abirth rate of AM CVn systems of 0. 005 yr − 1, a merger rate of pairs with a combined mass exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit (which may be progenitors of SNe Ia) of 0. 003 yr − 1 and a formation rate of planetary nebulae of 1 yr − 1. We estimate the total number of <b>double</b> <b>white</b> dwarfs in the Galaxy as 2. 5 10 8. In an observable sample with a limiting magnitude Vlim = 15 wepredictthepresenceof∼ 855 white dwarfs of which ∼ 220 are close pairs.
