50|$|The Arthur Wool Shed Group, with {{shearing}} shed, shearers' quarters, sheep <b>dip</b> and <b>concrete</b> cricket pitch, {{is one of}} {{the most}} prominent buildings in the town. It was first established in 1910 and opened as a one-stop-shop for community shearers in the 1950s. It was extensively restored in the three years to 2002, at which point the complex was heritage listed by the Heritage Council of WA.|$|R
500|$|A road first {{appeared}} in the location of RE2 around 1940. This route was an unimproved dirt track with a primitive bridge over a small creek near the middle of it. The road led to a small community made up of three residential buildings. By 1951, the highway's bridge had been converted to a small <b>concrete</b> <b>dip</b> which allowed the creek to flow through it. [...] The route had been improved to a graded, drained gravel surface by 1956. By 1961, it had been improved to a metaled surface, and had been straightened along the eastern portion. Two additional <b>concrete</b> <b>dips</b> had been constructed, over two small creeks connecting to Devils River. In addition, the community which the road served had expanded to five residential structures and a gate was built at the western end of the highway.|$|R
50|$|Peachester Public Dip {{demonstrates}} the principal {{characteristics of a}} plunge cattle dip used to combat cattle tick {{in the early part}} of the 20th century. These characteristics include the rectilinear <b>dip</b> formed in <b>concrete</b> with a stepped concrete ramp up from the dip; a timber-framed, gabled roof clad in corrugated iron sheeting and posts of the associated holding yards.|$|R
50|$|Pavers come in {{a number}} of styles, shapes and tones. Pavers {{manufactured}} from concrete go well with flag, brick and concrete walkways or patios. If you reside in climates wherever winter temperatures <b>dip</b> below zero, <b>concrete</b> pavers are an honest selection. They are ready to stoppage well in extreme temperatures. Opt for pavers in shades like ochre, pink, bisque, white or sand. Pavers are available in hole, x-shape, y-shape, pentagon, polygon and fan styles.|$|R
50|$|Peachester Public <b>Dip</b> is a <b>concrete</b> formed cattle <b>dip</b> framed with slab {{posts and}} a sawn timber roof clad in {{corrugated}} iron sheeting. It dates from 1915 when it replaced an earlier timber dip built by Landsborough Shire Council on the site, {{which had been}} reserved as a Stock Dip Reserve in November 1910. These dips were erected {{in response to the}} spread of cattle tick into Queensland which threatened the cattle industry throughout the State and dairying in south-east Queensland.|$|R
500|$|On April 1, 1970, RE2 {{was officially}} {{designated}} by TxDOT. The highway, along with Recreational Road 255, {{became the first}} routes designated as [...] "recreational roads" [...] by the Texas State Highway Department. However, both roadways still had {{to be approved by}} the Highway Department's Administration Circle; RE255 was approved on April 15, 1970, making it the first official highway. RE2 was approved by the Administration Circle on June 1, 1970, making it the second route officially designated as a recreational road. Since RE2's designation, each recreational road has been numbered sequentially. Between 1970 and 1972, the highway was paved, and the <b>concrete</b> <b>dips</b> replaced with drainage pipes. One of the route's bends was straightened, shortening it from [...] to about [...] in length. The highway has not undergone any major rerouting or redesignation since.|$|R

50|$|The {{central core}} of the cattle yards {{comprises}} crushes for de-horning, cutting, drafting, dipping, and branding. Surrounding the stock working facilities of the central core, are the receiving, forcing and holding yards. The de-horning and cutting crush, cattle dip and stock loading ramp are in better condition than most sections of the yards, possibly through having remained in use and repair until {{the closure of the}} station. The loading ramp was built in the early 1960s and is the most recent structure. The most substantial feature of the yards is the cattle dip, which is of the conventional design and construction. The dip was built during the O'Beirne's tenure and is the earliest surviving structure within the yards. The walls of the <b>dip</b> are of <b>concrete</b> with concrete rendered steps and pit. Bush timber uprights and rafters support a corrugated iron roof that covers the dip itself. Steps lead out of the dip to a concrete-surfaced draining and pound yard. Beyond the dip is a large circular holding yard over 50 metres in diameter which forms a significant feature of the stockyards.|$|R
