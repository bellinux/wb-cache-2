40|$|The {{multi-tenancy}} of a cloud usually {{leads to}} security concerns over <b>network</b> <b>isolation</b> around each cloud tenant's virtual resources. However, verifying <b>network</b> <b>isolation</b> in cloud virtual networks poses several unique challenges. The {{sheer size of}} virtual networks implies a prohibitive complexity, whereas the constant changes in virtual resources demand a short response time. To make things worse, such networks typically allow fine-grained (e. g., VM-level) and distributed (e. g., security groups) network access control. Those challenges can either invalidate existing approaches or cause an unacceptable delay which prevents runtime applications. In this thesis, we present TenantGuard, a scalable system for verifying cloud-wide, VM-level <b>network</b> <b>isolation</b> at runtime. We {{take advantage of the}} hierarchical nature of virtual networks, efficient data structures, incremental verification, and parallel computation to reduce the performance overhead of security verification. We implement our approach based on OpenStack and evaluate its performance both in-house and on Amazon EC 2, which confirms its scalability and efficiency (13 seconds for verifying 168 millions of VM pairs). We further integrate TenantGuard with Congress, an OpenStack policy service, to verify the compliance of isolation results against tenant-specific high level security policies...|$|R

40|$|Synopsis: This thesis {{endeavors to}} study the living {{conditions}} of Norwegian pre-trial prisoners subject to restrictions. These prisoners were virtually never permitted to associate with each other, nor allowed contact with family or friends, in order to mitigate risks to the investigation. Research shows that remand custody puts a strain on inmates. Solitary confinement (isolation) and lack of human contact can have an adverse effect on an inmate's physical and mental health. Three out of four suicides in prison are committed during remand custody. 	 The prison staff makes a considerable effort to counteract these effects. However, the network of relational elements in which these interactions take place is especially peculiar. This thesis proposes the following research question regarding said network: Who are the actors, {{and how do they}} influence the actor-network of isolation for remand prisoners under restrictions? In attempting to answer this question I utilize actor-network theory (ANT), which analyzes structural entanglements involving both humans and non-humans actors, and thereby welcome non-human actors into the realm of social science. Actor-network theory is also unique for its radical relationalism. Applying ANT to prisoner <b>isolation</b> <b>networks</b> provides a fresh perspective on remand prisoners and reveals actors previously not sufficiently recognized in relevant literature.

40|$|A dc SQUID phase qubit {{consists}} of two Josephson junctions in a loop. One junction acts as a qubit with two lowest energy levels forming the | 0 > and | 1 > status. The second junction and the loop inductance act to isolate the qubit junction from noise. In this thesis, I report on {{the improvement of the}} relaxation time and the coherence time in a dc SQUID phase qubit that used an LC filter. I also report the measurement of anomalous switching curves. In order to improve the relaxation and coherence times, I used two isolation networks, an LC <b>isolation</b> <b>network</b> and an inductive <b>isolation</b> <b>network,</b> to decouple the device from the current bias lines. This produced a very large total effective resistance of the input leads that increases the relaxation time of the qubit. In addition, I connected a low-loss SiNx shunting capacitor across the qubit junction to reduce dielectric losses. I measured two dc SQUID phase qubits. Device DS 6 had a 4 (μm) 2 Al/AlOx/Al qubit junction with a critical current of 0. 5 μA and a 1 pF shunting capacitor. It used an LC filter made from a 10 nH inductor and a 145 pF capacitor. The capacitors contained N-H rich SiNx which produced a loss tangent of about 7 × 10 - 4. Device DS 8 had a 2 (μm) 2 Al/AlOx/Al qubit junction with a critical current of 77 nA and an LC filter similar to the first one. The shunting capacitor contained Si-H rich SiNx. Using a pulse readout technique, I measured the characteristics of the qubits, including the transition spectrum, Rabi oscillations, relaxation, Ramsey fringes and state tomography. The best relaxation time T 1 for device DS 6 was 32 ns and 280 ns for device DS 8. The best Rabi decay time T' for DS 6 was 42 ns while for device DS 8 it was 120 ns. From these and other data I obtained estimates for the best coherence time T 2 in device DS 6 of 61 ns and 76 ns in device DS 8. In DS 8, I observed anomalous switching curves; i. e. switching curves which were qualitatively different from conventional switching curves. In the conventional case, the switching curve for the superposition state is the weighted sum of the | 0 > and | 1 > curves, but it was not in device DS 8. Instead, the switching curve shifted along the current axis as the exited state probability increased.

These devices use a SQUID magnetometer to measure the variation in the dc magnetization of a thermometric element that consists of a dilute concentration of manganese in a palladium matrix.

In hybrid P 2 P network environments, there exists a server that maintains index information for the data to be shared and <b>network</b> <b>isolation</b> does not occur because every peer always keeps connection to the server.

Coupling of the qubit to the bias lines and lossy dielectrics causes the qubit to lose quantum information {{through a process}} known generally as decoherence. Using knowledge of the possible sources of decoherence, a dc SQUID phase qubit is designed with parameters that should have made it resistant to dissipation and dephasing from those sources.

40|$|Current {{scholarship}} commonly {{posits that}} network recruitment contributes to job sex segregation {{and that the}} segregated nature of personal contact networks explains this effect. A variety of empirical findings inconsistent with this explanation demonstrate its inadequacy. Building on Kanter’s observation that recruitment processes often resemble “homosocial reproduction” [Kanter RM (1977) Men and Women of the Corporation (Basic Books, New York) ], we develop a population dynamics model of network recruitment. The resulting formal model builds a parsimonious theory regarding the segregating effects of network recruitment, resolving the puzzles and inconsistencies revealed by recent empirical findings. This revised theory also challenges conventional understandings of how network recruitment segregates: in <b>isolation,</b> <b>network</b> recruitment—even with segregated networks—is more likely to desegregate rather than segregate. Network recruitment segregates primarily through its interactions with other supply-side (e. g., gendered self-sorting) or demand-side (e. g., gendered referring rates) biasing mechanisms. Our model reveals whether {{and to what extent}} network recruitment segregates or desegregates, and it reveals opportunities for organizational intervention. There is an easily calculable tipping point where demand-side factors such as gender differences in referring can counteract and neutralize other segregating effects from referring. Independent of other personnel practices, organizational policies affecting employees’ referring behaviors can tip the balance to determine whether network recruitment serves as a segregating or desegregating force. We ground our model empirically using three organizational cases...|$|E
