40|$|Currently {{there is}} no consistent, widely {{accepted}} procedure for discretizing levee systems subjected to seismic load for probabilistic analysis. Further, statistical independence of performance between levee sections is often assumed without verification. This stems from the difficulty in: quantifying the spatial autocorrelation structure of random variables used to predict performance and, implementing autocorrelation structure into probabilistic levee analysis. In this research we use First Order Reliability Method (FORM), Second Order Reliability Method (SORM), Sequential Important Conditional Sampling (SCIS) and Directional Important Sampling (DIRS) {{in an attempt to}} define a robust methodology for discretizing a levee system for probabilistic analysis and to show that assuming independence of performance between individual levee sections is not valid. 	We chose to use the levee that protects Sherman Island, CA as our case study. Sherman Island is located in the California Bay Delta, which is the terminus of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers and a strategically vital hub of infrastructure for the region and the State of California. To use the reliability tools we have selected it was necessary for us to define compatible levee performance models. Compatible models must be continuous functions of random variables that are differentiable and the random variables must be continuous and described by a joint probability distribution. Rather than develop our own models we adopted levee performance models developed in the <b>Delta</b> <b>Risk</b> Management Strategy (DRMS) Phase 1 Report (URS 2009). This report was a comprehensive risk analysis of the California Bay Delta. The seismic performance models developed within were not fully compatible with or reliability tools. Therefore we made appropriate and technically sound adjustments to the models. 	To ensure that our seismic levee performance models were producing reasonable results we used them to calculate point estimates of failure probability at Sherman Island for past seismic events: M&# 8776; 7. 9 1906 Great San Francisco Event, M= 5. 8 1980 Livermore Event, M= 6. 19 1984 Morgan Hill Event and M= 6. 9 1989 Loma Prieta Event. There were no documented seismic failure for the three most recent events and our failure probability estimates agree well with this. 	As mentioned above, quantifying the spatial autocorrelation structure of random variables used to predict levee performance is a non-trivial task. As part of this study we investigated the spatial autocorrelation structure of ground motion intensity measures. Specifically we characterized the spatial autocorrelation structure of single-station intra-event residuals and site terms. We did this for three different sets of ground motion data: a Californian dataset (Chiou et al., 2010), a Taiwanese dataset (Lin et al., 2011) and a Japanese dataset (Rodriguez-Marek et al., 2011). Single-station intra-event residuals come from single-station sigma ground motion prediction equations, which are models that have removed repeatable site effects from the standard deviation. We show that the spatial autocorrelation structure of single-station intra-event residuals and site terms are region dependent and sensitive to the period of pseudo spectral acceleration. Further we show that single-station intra-event residuals stay autocorrelated for greater distances than intra-event residuals. We implemented our characterization of ground motion autocorrelation into our levee reliability analysis. 	There was not sufficient data for us to quantify the spatial autocorrelation structure of the random variables that describe material properties of the levee. There are studies on spatial autocorrelation of material properties in the literature however; none of studies are at an applicable scale for our analysis. Additionally, there is little guidance on whether or not model error terms are autocorrelated. We test a range of assumptions on the spatial autocorrelation of the material properties and model error terms in our analysis. 	The results of our analysis suggest that: A robust methodology for discretization of levee systems under seismic load is dependent on the scale of the potential failure mechanisms and, the assumption of statistical independence of performance between levee sections is not appropriate. Though we were unable to develop a specific methodology for the discretization of a levee system we provide a relationship for adjusting failure probability estimates of a levee based on its length and assumptions about the scale of potential failure mechanisms and the amount of autocorrelation present in random variables used for prediction...|$|E

The purpose will be derived into four research objective: to measure the extent of risk disclosure in the Indonesian banking sector; to compare the risk disclosure practice between listed and unlisted banks, and between Islamic and non-Islamic banks; to study the determinants of risk disclosure and what factors affect a bank's decision to disclose risk information; and to analyse the value relevance information on risk disclosure of listed banks, unlisted banks, Islamic banks, and non-Islamic banks. Agency theory, signalling theory, stakeholder theory, and communication theory were used for underpinning theory. The annual reports of 120 banks which released between 2008 and 2012 were employed for testing in this research. Risk disclosure was measured by the number of Indonesian risk keywords divided by the number of Indonesian sentences in annual reports. Firm value for listed banks was measured by Tobin’s Q. The Black Scholes Merton model was employed for measuring firm value of unlisted banks. The number of risk keywords, number of sentences, and risk disclosure in the Indonesian banks showed an upward trend. The delta of size, liquidity, profitability, leverage, and earnings reinvestment did not have association with the <b>delta</b> of <b>risk</b> disclosure in all banks, LB IB, NIB. The delta of firm value in all banks, LB, ULB, and NIB has an association with aggregate the delta of firm characteristics and the <b>delta</b> of <b>risk</b> disclosure.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the sophistication of}} rating agencies in incorporating managerial risk-taking incentives into their credit risk evaluation. We measure risk-taking incentives using two proxies: the sensitivity of managerial wealth to stock return volatility (vega) and the sensitivity of managerial wealth to stock price (delta). We find that rating agencies impound managerial risk-taking incentives in their credit risk assessments. Assuming other things equal, a one standard deviation increase in vega (delta) will lead to an approximately one-notch (two-notch) rating downgrade. In addition, we evaluate the significance of credit ratings {{in the design of}} CEO compensation. Our findings suggest that rating-troubled firms will gear down managerial incentives of risk seeking. In particular, other things equal, a rating downgrade to the lower edge of the investment category (i. e., BBB-) in the immediate prior year will bring about an approximately 51 percent reduction of vega incentive from options newly granted to the CEO in the current year. However, we find no evidence that firms' rating concerns significantly affect delta. Given the significance of credit ratings in the marketplace and their close connection to accounting, the findings of the current study advance our understanding, not only of how sophisticated rating agencies are in incorporating forward-looking information (i. e., vega and <b>delta)</b> into <b>risk</b> assessments, but of how influential the raters are in changing firms' compensation policies. The findings also have implications on the role of accounting in constraining excessive managerial risk taking with improved disclosures on managerial compensation. © CAAA...|$|R

Flood protection works in the Red River Delta provide safety for twenty million people and enable vital economic activity. The population, the economic activity and the investments are expected to increase rapidly in the future, which will lead to an even greater flooding risk for the protection areas in the Red River Delta.

40|$|Climate change creates {{challenges}} for developments in coastal and <b>delta</b> areas. The <b>risks</b> are reduced more effectively if both planned and autonomous adaptations take place. Flood risk management {{is dominated by}} planned adaptation, which is primarily command-and-control in nature, e. g. spatial planning and engineered flood defenses. If autonomous adaptation is downplayed {{people are more likely}} to make land-use choices that collectively lead to increasing flood risks while leaving the costs of adaptation and land scarcity with governments. Unless governments provide stimuli, autonomous adaptation in flood-prone areas is unlikely to happen due to spatial externalities, path-dependency and time lag between private investment decisions and consequences. This paper reviews the theory and practice of using market-based instruments (MBIs) for flood-risk management as means for autonomous climate change adaptation. While the use of MBIs for climate change mitigation is widely discussed, systematized reviews of various MBIs for climate change adaptation are rare. Yet, international experience shows that such measures as preferential taxes, non-perverse subsidies, flood insurance, marketable permits and transferable development rights can engage local stakeholders and provide price signals that stimulate individual adaptation. MBIs combined with command-based instruments help policy-makers to guide developments in flood-prone zone by affecting individual behavior via market forces. As adverse consequences of climate change become more pronounced locally, quantity-based MBIs unfeasible at present should become more attractive. Price-based MBIs that are currently employed could be designed to strategically account for increasing climate-induced flood and erosion probabilities in coastal and delta areas...|$|R

This thesis focuses on the Netherlands as a representative urbanized <b>delta</b> and flood <b>risk</b> management. The central element of this thesis is uncertainty. Evacuation has benefits but can be costly. Therefore, the decision to call for an evacuation due to the threat of flooding results in a crisis, by definition, but can prevent a worse crisis {{in the case of an}} actual flood. This thesis focuses on effectiveness of different types of evacuation and how to address uncertainties. The effectiveness of different types of evacuation as preventive evacuation and vertical evacuation is defined, in response to large-scale flooding. It is shown that Evacuation is part of a portfolio of measures in an optimal investment strategy in a multilateral safety system in addition to the most important measure prevention. Preparation for an evacuation entails meeting predefined criteria that are related to desired effectiveness of evacuation. It is concluded that evacuation in case of the threat of flooding requires an uncomplicated approach and centralisation. This is because of the complexity of preparation for low-frequency, large-scale disasters as flooding and the limited risk perception by the public, decision makers and the number of them which are involved. Centralisation, however, works in opposition to the daily practice of the organisations involved in evacuation planning because each of these organisations aims to optimise its own role and objectives, focus on preventive evacuation and best case scenarios. This research developed a method to define the optimal moment to call for an evacuation in case of a threat.

40|$|Vietnamese aquaculture, in general, and Vietnamese catfish farming, in particular, {{has also}} {{experienced}} a {{rapid growth in}} the past decade to meet the increasing demand both domestically and internationally. The fast growing catfish industry is troubled by many problems, challenges and uncertainties such as: environmental and edaphic issues, losses due to disease, strict quality and safety regulations, export-import restrictions, increasing production costs, sustainability, oversupply and other global and regional socioeconomic problems. All these uncertainties are potentially detrimental risks to the catfish industry {{and they need to be}} managed in a systematic way for the sustainable development of the industry. A sound and solid risk management framework, as well as a risk management tool, is very much needed for Vietnamese catfish farming. The purpose of this study is to develop a risk management framework for Vietnamese catfish farming. Three objectives are proposed: (1) to examine the perceptions of risks and risk management in catfish farming; (2) to develop a risk management framework for Vietnamese catfish farming; and (3) to develop a decision support system (DSS) as an implementation tool for risk management in Vietnamese catfish farming. Prior to the development of the risk management framework, Vietnamese catfish farmers’ perceptions of risks and risk management were examined using the data collected from a questionnaire survey of 261 catfish farmers in the Mekong Delta. Descriptive statistics methods were used to evaluate the perceptions of risk and risk management. Next, exploratory factor analysis (EPA) and multivariate regression methods were used to determined the influences of farm socioeconomic characteristics on the perceptions of risks and risk management. A risk management framework was developed as a combination of the catfish business process model and the risk management process introduced by AS/NZS 4360. The seven (7) steps in the risk management process were subsequently applied on each of the sub-processes in the catfish farming business. The data used for the development of the risk management framework were collected from a survey of 261 catfish farmers in the Mekong <b>Delta.</b> The <b>risk</b> management framework developed in this study was then used as the foundation for the development of the DSS as an implementing tool for risk management in Vietnamese catfish farming. Once the risk management framework was developed, a DSS for risk management was then built upon as a tool implementing the proposed framework for practical risk management activity. The developed DSS has three main components: a model system, a data system, and a user interface. The system was written in Visual Basic for Application on the Microsoft Excel platform. Finally, a modified UTAUT model was built to evaluate the acceptance of the DSS for risk management in Vietnamese catfish farming.

In this context, during the coming years, climatic change will increase the number and diversity of flood risk events and other phenomena related to the water cycle. Extreme meteorological phenomena such as heavy rains causing flash floods could become more frequent in all Europe. In the Danube <b>delta,</b> flood <b>risk</b> is a major natural risk. Since 2000, this coastal wetland has been seriously hit by floods in 2002, 2005, 2006, 2009 and 2010. Based on hydrological and satellite observations of the bicentennial floods of summer 2010 and the drought of summer/autumn 2011, this paper deals with the issue of forecasting by knowledge and assessment of the flood <b>risk</b> in Danube <b>delta.</b> One of the major objectives of this methodological work consists in the exploration and evaluation of several data types relevant to this type of analysis, i. e. optical and radar satellite data from the Japanese ALOS and Canadian RADARSAT- 2 sensors in order to propose regional indicators {{that can be used for}} the forecasting of flood risk in the floodplain wetland of the Danube delta. This procedure will provide a framework for flood mapping, monitoring flood area potential and, the detection and characterization of the floodable. Using 20 ALOS and RADARSAT- 2 radar and optical images, this paper proposes first a series of change indicators for land cover during the floods of 2010, before the floods (of 2009) and afterwards, and during the 2011 drought. Using the two polarization modes (dual and full) of the radar sensors, these change indicators are applied first to the polarimetric indicators (intensity, entropy, span, etc.) derived from the different significant data of extreme events in the delta (2010 flood and 2011 drought). By taking advantage of the complementary of the data of the two sensors and by associating the different spatial resolutions (from 10 m to 3 m), we establish wavelength change comparisons depending on the correspondence between the images acquired by the two satellites. Using a multi-modality methodology based on radar image processing (dual versus full polarimetric data, multi-angular, multi-frequency and multi-resolution data) it is possible to analyze the impact of the wavelength, the incidence angle or the polarimetric mode, but also the impact of the resolution in SAR image analysis of floodable areas. The second category of indicators to be suggested for the Regional library will be composed of the spectroradiometric measurements of the primary objects characteristic of floodable areas (the main species that compose the vegetation cover, the main crops, the main construction materials in urban areas, etc.) in the delta. The portable spectroradiometer permits the measurement of in situ reflectance, significantly improving the spectral characterization of the spectral classes detected on the optical images (ALOS). The risk indicators resulting from this research will contribute to the implementation of regional models and scenarios in terms of flood risk thus providing a useful tool for decision-making...|$|R
40|$|Risk {{management}} {{has always been}} in key component of portfolio management. While more and more complicated models are proposed and implemented as research advances, they all inevitably rely on imperfect assumptions and estimates. This dissertation aims to investigate the gap between complicated theoretical modelling and practice. We mainly focus on two directions: model risk and reblancing error. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, we develop a framework for quantifying the impact of model error and for measuring and minimizing risk in a way that is robust to model error. This robust approach starts from a baseline model and finds the worst-case error in risk measurement that would be incurred through a deviation from the baseline model, given a precise constraint on the plausibility of the deviation. Using relative entropy to constrain model distance leads to an explicit characterization of worst-case model errors; this characterization lends itself to Monte Carlo simulation, allowing straightforward calculation of bounds on model error with very little computational effort beyond that required to evaluate performance under the baseline nominal model. This approach goes well beyond the effect of errors in parameter estimates to consider errors in the underlying stochastic assumptions of the model and to characterize the greatest vulnerabilities to error in a model. We apply this approach to problems of portfolio risk measurement, credit <b>risk,</b> <b>delta</b> hedging, and counterparty risk measured through credit valuation adjustment. In the second part, we apply this robust approach to a dynamic portfolio control problem. The sources of model error include the evolution of market factors and the influence of these factors on asset returns. We analyze both finite- and infinite-horizon problems in a model in which returns are driven by factors that evolve stochastically. The model incorporates transaction costs and leads to simple and tractable optimal robust controls for multiple assets. We illustrate the performance of the controls on historical data. Robustness does improve performance in out-of-sample tests in which the model is estimated on a rolling window of data and then applied over a subsequent time period. By acknowledging uncertainty in the estimated model, the robust rules lead to less aggressive trading and are less sensitive to sharp moves in underlying prices. In the last part, we analyze the error between a discretely rebalanced portfolio and its continuously rebalanced counterpart in the presence of jumps or mean-reversion in the underlying asset dynamics. With discrete rebalancing, the portfolio's composition is restored to a set of fixed target weights at discrete intervals; with continuous rebalancing, the target weights are maintained at all times. We examine the difference between the two portfolios as the number of discrete rebalancing dates increases. We derive the limiting variance of the relative error between the two portfolios for both the mean-reverting and jump-diffusion cases. For both cases, we derive ``volatility adjustments'' to improve the approximation of the discretely rebalanced portfolio by the continuously rebalanced portfolio, based on on the limiting covariance between the relative rebalancing error and the level of the continuously rebalanced portfolio. These results are based on strong approximation results for jump-diffusion processes...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{discusses the}} use of Delta in regulating the investment behaviour of the Trustees of Self-Managed Superannuation Funds (SMSFs) who use Exchange Traded Options (ETOs) in their investment strategies. An ETO represents a contract between two parties, giving the taker (the buyer) the right, but not the obligation, {{to buy or sell}} a parcel of shares at a predetermined price, on or before a predetermined date, to or from the writer (the seller). It is acceptable for SMSF Trustees to use ETO investments as part of their overall investment strategy, providing that leverage or mere speculation are not the reasons behind that investment. It {{is important to note that}} neither the Regulator, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO), nor its predecessor, the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (APRA), actually state what constitutes 'speculation', or what the allowable uses for derivatives are. There are no practical guidelines. This is a key issue for this research, which aims, as practically as possible, to fill these crucial gaps. A Trustee must abide by their superannuation fund's overriding covenants and investment strategy, and inform its members, through Risk Management Statements, of the trust's derivative strategy. While ETOs can be used to manage risk, they also carry a level of <b>risk</b> themselves. <b>Delta</b> measures an ETO's value movement in correlation with a movement in the option's underlying share price. An ETO carrying a low Delta generally means a cheaper price (premium) per contract than an option carrying a higher Delta. The lower the Delta, however, the lower the chance there is of a positive result for the buyer. This research shows that an ETO Delta of less than 0. 2 gives results in favour of buyers in only 11 out of 100 occurrences. This figure rises to 42 out of 100 when Delta is greater than 0. 8. From the sampled data, there is an overall financial loss to the buyer of - 1. 91 %, with the financial return results being mixed at all levels of Delta. The overall return results have been compiled without preference to market direction, and clearly highlight the natural premium bias (which the buyer pays) to the seller. What this data does is reenforce the need for Trustees to have a solid view of market directions, or a set strategy in place, as buyers of ETOs. The conclusions drawn from the findings show that the chance of loss (when buying), or gain (when selling) ETOs with a Delta of; - less than 0. 20 is 89 %; - less than 0. 40 is 74 %; - less than 0. 60 is 66 %; - less than 0. 80 is 57 %; - greater than 0. 80 is 58 %; For example, a Trustee buying an ETO with a Delta of less than 0. 20, faces an 89 % chance of loss; a Trustee selling an ETO with a Delta of less than 0. 20, faces an 89 % chance of gain. The findings on overall financial returns (profit or loss) offer additional support to this critical review of <b>Delta</b> as a <b>risk</b> measurement tool. Whist it is impossible to know the motives or actual positions of portfolio managers of SMSF at any time, the aim of the thesis is to provide a measurement tool that can be used to assist the trustee at any given time by measuring the option risk element alone. When interpreting the findings, the reader must remember that ETO strategies are numerous, and a high-risk profile for one strategy may represent a low risk for another. Further to this, an ETO strategy's risk profile may change with the overlaying of another ETO. For example, where a Call option is bought, the risk involved in that purchase is represented by the premium paid. However, another Call option can then be sold against that position, with a later (or earlier) date to expiry, and with a higher strike price. This 'overlay' reduces the initial risk, but impacts on the maximum gain. It is vital that Trustees have a solid understanding of the basics of ETO strategies before considering using Delta as a measure of risk. The research proposes some guidelines Trustees can use when assessing an ETO strategy against their derivative/investment risk profile. For example, a Trustee buying an ETO with a Delta of less than 0. 20, faces an 89 % chance of loss; a Trustee selling an ETO with a Delta of less than 0. 20, faces an 89 % chance of gain.

The research proposes some guidelines Trustees can use when assessing an ETO strategy against their derivative/investment risk profile. The findings from 2400 data samples show strong trends in support of the underlying premise (see Figure: Positive Results Versus Delta (ETO Buyers)). Given these findings, the research concludes that Delta can be used as a measure of risk by SMSF Trustees. Delta may not be suitable, however, for measuring multiple layers of combined ETO positions, a type of derivative strategy not suited to or usual in the context of measuring risk within a SMSF. There is a major difference between simple and simplistic solutions offering practical answers in an environment of increasing complexity. Often, simple solutions offer far more value to the less experienced, when compared to complex ones, especially given the growing number of SMSFs, and the increasing lack of expertise in the areas of superannuation and risk management that this growth implies...|$|R
40|$|Eels (Anguilla {{anguilla}} L.) {{live in the}} brackish waters vallis of the Mediterranean, {{where the}} elvers enter the lagoons and estuaries and grow in the sheltered areas, feeding on natural food available in the bottom sediments. Eels are therefore exposed to persistent pollutants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides. These lipophilic xenobiotics tend to accumulate in high concentrations in this species because of its considerable fat amount. Alarming concentrations form heavily polluted areas {{have been reported in}} eels; for example, 91 % of this species of fish from the lower Elbe River contained levels exceeding the regulatory limits. Moreover, studies from the river Rhine have suggested that the high levels of organochlorine residues found in eels, are due to biomagnification through the food chain. PCBs and chlorinated pesticides have also been detected in different species of fish in the final stretch of the River Po, which is considered a land based source of pollution in the Adriatic Sea. In order to find out whether contamination by PCBs and organochlorine pesticides in the Po <b>Delta</b> poses a <b>risk</b> to human and animal health, studies on the content of the above pollutants in eels were carried out. Twenty eels of 548 +- 126 g weight and 43 +- cm length, were caught twice a year, in March and October 1994. Fish muscles were homogenized in a mixer and freeze-dried. A 30 g sample of the above mixture was dissolved in 20 ml of acetonitrile and placed in an ultrasonic bath for 5 minutes. After sedimentation the supernatant was centrifuged at 1400 rpm for 10 minutes, following which the volume was reduced by means of a rotavapor to about 5 ml and the resulting extract passed through a liquid chromatography LC- 18 (octadecyl) column in order to remove lipids and hydrocarbons. Subsequently, this extract was passed through a LC-NH 2 (aminopropil) column to remove polar substances such as amines and organic acids and then it was further concentrated under a gentle stream of N 2 at room temperature. A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Hewlett Packard 5890 GC with a 5989 mass selective detector) equipped with a fused silica capillary column (Alltech SE 30 m x 0. 25 mm) was used for the quantification of the pesticides. The operating conditions were as follows: injection port temperature 260 °C, column initial temperature 100 °C, rate of temperature increase 10 °C/min. With a final temperature of 300 °C, helium was used as the carrier gas (25 cm/sec at 200 °C). The mass spectrometer was used in SIM mode (Selected Ion Monitoring) under the following conditions: electron energy 70 eV, source temperature 200 °C, quadrupole temperature 100 °C, electron multiplier voltage 2200 V. The SIM programmes used for the analysis of chlorinated pesticides and PCBs were selected to enable the simultaneous determination of more than fifty compounds. Confirmation and quantification of the various pesticides and PCBs, were carried out by comparison with standard of 99 - 100 % purity (Cambridge Isotope Lab., Woburn, MA, USA). The levels of pollutants found in fish muscle demonstrate the continuing presence of p,p’-DDT (4. 16 +- 0. 76 µg/kg dry weight) and some metabolites (p,p’-DDE and p,p’-DDD) although it has been banned in Italy since 1978. Contamination with other organochlorinated pesticides was significant, whereas for PCBs high values were found (23. 80 +- 8. 15 µg/kg dry weight). However, this levels do not present risk for the survival and normal development of fish living in this area. Therefore, there is no real health hazard for people consuming eels caught in waterways form the River Po...|$|R
40|$|The Delta of the Ebro River (Catalonia, Spain) {{is among}} the most {{important}} marsh areas in the Western Mediterranean Sea, highly valuable both economically and ecologically. Fluvial sediment reduction by dams in a relative sea-level rise (RSLR) scenario (eustatic sea-level rise + subsidence) has increased the <b>delta</b> plain flooding <b>risk.</b> Traditional and current agricultural practices have transformed large areas of marshes and lagoons into rice fields, now occupying up to 60 % of the deltaic plain. Agricultural runoff carries substantial loads of pesticide and fertilizer to natural habitats. To reduce ecological impacts, several marsh restoration efforts have been initiated to improve water quality and increase wildlife habitat. However, previous experimental studies in the Ebro Delta and other Mediterranean marshes have not focused on overall ecological benefits and costs of restored marshes providing simultaneously vertical accretion to deal with flooding risk, carbon (C) sequestration and pollutant removal services. A need for more knowledge is required to optimize factors controlling these ecosystem services seeking to work as natural defence against flooding risk, sequestering C, as well as natural filters of agricultural runoff. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the multifunctional use and factors controlling of vertical accretion, C accumulation and pollutant concentration reduction in Mediterranean oligohaline restored marshes. We conducted a 3 -year experimental field study in a newly established restored marsh using two different freshwater input types, riverine irrigation water (IW) and rice field drainage water (DW) and three water levels (10, 20 and 30 cm depth). The results indicate overall benefits of the restored marsh providing marsh elevation, C accumulation and pollutant removal services. This study indicates that Mediterranean oligohaline restored marshes might buffer flooding risk dealing with sediment deficit and RSLR in the Ebro Delta due to high mean rates of vertical accretion (11. 5 ± 0. 8 and 15. 5 ± 0. 6 mm yr⁻¹) and elevation change (9. 1 ± 1. 4 and 8. 8 ± 2. 8 mm yr⁻¹) in both water type treatments (IW and DW respectively), at least during the initial phase of marsh establishment. Rice field drainage waters provided higher sediment concentrations to the restored marsh, which in turn promoted C accumulation. Two years after the establishment of the restored marsh, C accumulation rates in both water type treatments (99. 44 and 126. 10 g m⁻² yr⁻¹) showed similar values to global estimates for freshwater marshes, but only half of salt marshes. The restored marsh was also an efficient N-P and metal filters even when receiving higher nutrient concentrations from rice field drainage waters: nutrient concentration reduction varied for total N (50. 66 ± 3. 85 %), N-NO₃⁻ (96. 10 ± 0. 35 %), N-NH₄⁺ (80. 76 ± 1. 8 %), total P (49. 96 ± 3. 95 %) and P-PO₄³⁻ (17. 99 ± 3. 92 %). Significantly higher Mn, Pb and Zn from drainage waters caused higher concentration reductions (47. 4 ± 9. 2 %, 44. 1 ± 4. 4 % and 23. 7 ± 4. 6 % respectively) in the DW treatment than the IW treatment. Higher Cu water concentrations from irrigation water increased significantly Cu concentration reduction (85. 4 ± 0. 5 %). Net export of As and Hg in both water treatments may be caused by releasing from previously stored metals in the pre-restored rice field soils. Plant growth affected ecosystem services in different ways. Root growth favoured marsh elevation, C accumulation and metal concentration reduction, especially as the weed P. distichum colonized rapidly and densely the restored marsh. However, higher nutrient concentrations from rice field drainage waters may also inhibit root growth. Root growth may also decrease nitrate concentration reduction ability via denitrification inhibition, but increased metal soil content via aerobic adsorption due to the plant ability to oxygenate their rhizosphere. This research supports that the use of rice field drainage waters as a primary source of nutrient and sediment as beneficial for marsh restoration projects focused on marsh elevation, C accumulation and pollutant removal. Higher nutrient and sediments concentrations enhanced these ecosystem services at least during initial stages of the restored marsh. The experimental marsh units receiving higher metal concentrations from rice field drainage water than river irrigation waters reduced metal water concentrations via soil content and accumulation. Organic soils and oxygen conditions enhanced by plant growth may favor soil metal content and higher sediment concentrations from rice field drainage waters also enhanced soil metal accumulation. Ph.
