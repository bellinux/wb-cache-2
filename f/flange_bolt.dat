40|$|Cracks at {{the seal}} fillet flange and the strut pilot groove of primary turbine drain {{passage of the}} space shuttle main engine (SSME) high {{pressure}} oxidizer turbopump (HPOTP) were observed and reported. Stress information for critical structural components in the SSME under actual conditions is necessary for design and life prediction analysis. However, little information is available about the stress distribution at this location under various combinations of loadings and environments. Thus, a stress analysis was conducted to determine an influence of the various operation and installation loads on the stresses of the HPOTP main mounting flange. To do this, a 3 -D finite element model of the HPOTP housing was generated. A fairly comfortable margin of stresses at the flange fillet with respect to the yield stress of Inconel 718 is shown. However, it was revealed that the bending stress arising from the housing <b>flange</b> <b>bolt</b> preloads could significantly affect the stress distribution at the strut pilot groove of primary turbine drain passage in the HPOTP housing. Consequently, the information obtained from the present 3 -D analysis results should be useful in guiding the development of the SSME HPOTP...|$|E

40|$|LectureHigh {{coupling}} guard temperature and oil misting on a power recovery expander {{led to a}} computational fluid dynamics (CFD) investigation of air flow and heat transfer in the {{coupling guard}}. The analyses included full 360 -degree geometry, varying inlet and outlet configurations, different exhaust pressures, and both including and neglecting the <b>flange</b> <b>bolt</b> heads. With bolt heads included, the predicted coupling guard surface temperatures approximately matched values measured in the field. In the particular field problem addressed here, the measured temperatures were 219 to 222 ?F (104 - 106 ?C), while the CFD predicted temperature ranged from 209 - 227 ?F (98 - 108 ?C). Among the important findings are: The moving bolt heads generate much of the heat in a coupling guard; Properly placed outlet ports can use the bolt heads as a blower, increasing air flow through the coupling guard and lowering the temperature; Small reductions in exhaust pressure can lower the coupling guard surface temperature significantly. Numerous plots, graphs, and tables give insight into the flow field inside the coupling guard. These analyses can guide the design of coupling guards with lower surface temperatures...|$|E

30|$|The {{modelling}} {{of contacts}} between various components {{plays a major}} role in the performance of the connection. The bolt pre-tension and friction are the most critical parameters. The forces are transmitted by friction between members as a result of bolt pre-tensioning. The contact pairs are web angles to beam web/column <b>flange,</b> <b>bolt</b> shank to bolt hole, and bolt head to respective components. Out of these, the contact between bolt shank and bolt hole is frictionless, whereas the others are friction contact. The interaction consists of two components, one normal to the surface and the other tangential to the surface. The tangential component consists of relative motion between the surfaces and frictional shear stress, if connection is made up of HSFG bolts. Hard contact is given between the surfaces, i.e., the surfaces separate, when the contact pressure between them becomes zero or negative. While in contact the normal and shear forces are transmitted from one surface to another. Thus, a suitable value of friction coefficient should be given such that the frictional forces resist relative sliding of the surface. To simulate the exact connection behaviour, finite sliding contact pair definition is given between the two surfaces, one of which is the master and other is slave surface. The master surface should be a discontinuous surface and the surface intersecting the master is called slave surface.|$|E

40|$|An {{appropriate}} flange tightening {{methods for}} small bore and low rating piping flange joints are clarified {{to improve the}} sealing performance of the <b>bolted</b> <b>flange</b> joints and the workability of flange tightening work. It is said that lubricant on the screw of the bolts and the nut-seating surface can minimize the variability of axial force acting on <b>flange</b> <b>bolts,</b> while this process might {{make it harder to}} tight the bolts uniformly especially for small bore low rating flanges. So, in this paper the appropriate condition to apply lubricant is clarified by a series of bolt tightening tests and sealing tests results. On the other hand, for the <b>bolted</b> <b>flanges</b> applying spiral wound gaskets, measuring the gasket compress dimensions help us to prevent uneven tightening balance and to perform the appropriate tightening work. Appropriate gasket compress dimensions are also clarified to ensure the sealing performance for the flanges based on the sealing tests results. Based on these test results, recommended flange-tightening methods have been summarized as an instruction and tightening work procedure to improve the sealing performance of the <b>bolted</b> <b>flanges</b> and the workability of flange tightening work...|$|R

40|$|Bolted {{flanged joints}} {{comprise}} an assembly {{of a number}} of important individual components, which are required to perform well together in service. The ideal requirement for a <b>bolted</b> <b>flange</b> joint is a 'zero-leak' condition. However, whilst recommended design procedures for <b>bolted</b> <b>flange</b> joints are available in international codes and standards, leakage problems are still faced by industry.
