The <b>spring</b> <b>struts</b> must operate correctly for the modules to separate safely. There was no vibration testing of strut development units scoped in the MPCV Program Plan; therefore, any design problems discovered {{as a result}} of vibration testing would not have been found until the component qualification. The NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) and Lockheed Martin (LM) performed random vibration testing on a single <b>spring</b> <b>strut</b> development unit to assess its ability to withstand qualification level random vibration environments. Failure of the strut while exposed to random vibration resulted in a follow-on failure investigation, design changes, and additional development tests.

Just {{three years later}} SUSPA is the market leader. The first products for the automobile industry are <b>gas</b> <b>springs</b> for opening and closing of tailgates in 1964. 1969 SUSPA develops a height adjustment system and a positioning system for backrests of office chairs.1973-1978 SUSPA expands in Europe, Asia and America; SUSPA develops silicone-damped impact absorbers for automobiles. 1988 SUSPA diversifies to a three-component water paint system and thus protects the environment by abstaining from using solvents and amines. 1991 SUSPA develops height adjustment systems for tables and work surfaces. 1994 a new business is founded in India. The mass production of spoiler adjustment systems begins in 1999 and SUSPA becomes a system supplier for the automotive industry. One year later SUSPA produces its first crash management system and opens an assembly plant in the Czech Republic. In 2003 the production capacities in Asia are expanded. Steadily increasing price competition in the world market coupled with heavily increased material costs forces SUSPA in 2008 to stop manufacturing <b>gas</b> <b>springs</b> for chairs and {{to focus more on}} the core business (Automotive and Industry). In June 2009 the company Tyrol Equity from Austria purchases 80 per cent of the company shares.

40|$|Abstract: Recently {{the use of}} <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> in {{the combat}} and {{commercial}} vehicle's suspension is increasing. Because of its nonlinear characteristics, the <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> can support wide range of dynamic loads and gives good ride quality. In design of <b>gas</b> <b>spring,</b> isothermal and adiabatic processes are applied generally, but those processes could not produce heat transfer effect in the simulation. So in this study, heat transfer differential equation and BWR/Ideal state equation are {{used to calculate the}} pressure of <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> which is changing with time. The numerical analysis showed that the pressure of <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> forms a hysteresis loop in the both of the state equations. But the peak pressure value of BWR equation over 0. 1 Hz frequency are higher than that of adiabatic process. And the test results showed that the differences between test results and ideal gas equation are smaller than those of BWR equation, so the ideal equation is more accurate than BWR equation in this case...|$|R
40|$|Testing and {{analysis}} of a free piston linear machine with <b>gas</b> <b>springs,</b> with applications in drilling technologyThis thesis is written in collaboration with Resonator AS, a company developing free piston linear machines for down-the-hole drilling applications. The free piston linear machine is designed to create heavy vibrations, which are used to break the rock. A successful product relies {{on the ability to}} deliver a sufficient hammering energy per blow to break the rock, at a high frequency, yielding a high rate of penetration (ROP). To reach the goal of making a faster drilling machine, Resonator has targeted electrical power density and stiff springs in the free piston linear machine, as critical factors. They have found mechanical springs inadequate for their application and are therefore researching the use of <b>gas</b> <b>springs</b> in a free piston linear machine. This thesis is focusing on the use of <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> in a free piston linear machine. The use of <b>gas</b> <b>springs</b> in a free piston linear machine is analyzed and tested, important parameters for the performance of such a machine are investigated with emphasis on the <b>gas</b> <b>springs.</b> Critical design factors found are structural design, thermal design, surface specifications, seal configuration, lubrication and tolerances. These areas are investigated in detail for the tested prototype. Advantages and disadvantages for the use of <b>gas</b> <b>springs</b> in such a machine are discussed; the main advantage found is that high frequencies’ seem to be obtainable, the main disadvantage is the friction in the <b>gas</b> <b>springs</b> causing heat generation and decreased efficiency. A linear <b>spring</b> equivalent for <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> stiffness is derived to ease analysis of systems using high velocity <b>gas</b> <b>springs.</b> This linear spring equivalent has been used to predict the resonate frequency of the machine. Test results show good coherence between the predicted frequency and the measured. The <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> stiffness equivalent has also been used to optimize the <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> chamber size. Based on the tests {{and analysis}} performed, improvements have been made to the prototype machine tested, and future improvements are suggested.

Based on the analysis, it seems to be possible to further improve the machine performance by implementing the suggested improvements.

50|$|Some {{pneumatic}} recoil buffers used in firearms are fast, low-power <b>gas</b> <b>springs.</b> When compressed, {{they present}} initial resistance as the rod-to-seal grip is broken {{and then they}} move in a regular manner. An additional small spring can be used inside the <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> if rapid turnaround times are needed. Springs twist and the coils try to ride over each other when moving and this chaotic movement does not exist with <b>gas</b> <b>springs,</b> hence reducing twist and jump of the firearm. These features are very advantageous. Fine tuning of the spring power is also possible by altering the internal gas volume.

40|$|Understanding the exergy losses {{stemming}} from heat transfer in compressors and expanders {{is important for}} many energy storage applications such as compressed air and pumped thermal storage. In order to obtain {{a better understanding of}} these losses, CFD simulations were performed for simple <b>gas</b> <b>springs,</b> for a <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> with an internal grid to mimic valve flow, and for a reciprocating compressor with functioning inlet and outlet valves. The wall heat exchanges for these three cases were examined and compared. The model adopted has previously been validated for a simple <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> using experimental data from literature. For the <b>gas</b> <b>spring</b> with an internal grid it was found that increased mixing leads to higher heat-transfer-induced hysteresis losses and (at high piston speeds) to a significant pressure loss. These two types of loss can be distinguished by undertaking adiabatic-wall calculations. For a compressor (i. e., with valve flows) heat transfer over the cycle depends very much on valve timing. For example, at 1500 rpm, when the delivery valve is opened at 7 bar the heat transfer coefficient for the initial stages of compression is similar to that for a simple <b>gas</b> <b>spring,</b> whereas for the same speed at 6 bar it is more than doubled.
