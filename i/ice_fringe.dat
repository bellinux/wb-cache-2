40|$|ABSTRACT. Snow-pack {{along the}} land-fast <b>ice</b> <b>fringe</b> off {{the north coast}} of Ellesmere Island was {{generally}} characterized by depth-hoar overlain by dense snow and wind slab. Mean snow depth {{in the study area}} was 0. 54 m (1982 - 85) and the mean S 180 value of the snow-pack was- 31. 30 / 00. Isotope data were not obtained previously for this geographic region and, therefore, complement a previous study of S 180 variations in High Arctic snow (Koerner, 1979). The data are consistent with an Arctic Ocean moisture source. The S 180 profiles show seasonal variations, with winter snow being more depleted in 180 than fall and spring snow. However, the S 180 profiles are dominated by a trend to higher S 180 values with increasing depth. This is attributed to a decrease in S 180 values as condensation temperatures fall during the autumn-winter accumulation period. During this time, there is also a change from relatively open to almost complete ice cover in the Arctic Ocean. The change in evaporation conditions and consequent effect on S values gives rise to a sharp discontinuity in the S 180 profiles and a bi-modal S 180 frequency distribution. The bi-modal distribution is reinforced by a secondary isotope fractionation that occurs during depth-hoar formation. This isotope effect leads to a wider S 180 range but does not significantly alter the mean S 180 value...|$|E
40|$|Between December 1996 and February 1997, weaned pups and postmoult female {{elephant}} seals (Mirounga leonina) were {{fitted with}} satellite transmitters at King George Island (South Shetlands). Of the nine adult females tracked {{for more than}} two months, three stayed in a localized area between the South Shetlands and the South Orkneys. The other six females travelled southwest along the coast of the Antarctic Peninsula up to the Bellingshausen Sea. Two of them then moved far northeast and hauled out on South Georgia in October. One female was last located north of the South Shetlands in March 1998. In total, eight females were again sighted on King George Island and six of the transmitters removed. The tracks of the weaners contrasted with those of the adults. In January, five juveniles left King George Island for the Pacific sector ranging about four weeks in the open sea west of the De Gerlache Seamounts. Three of them returned to the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula in June, of which one was last located on the Patagonian Shelf in November 1997. The juveniles avoided sea ice while the adults did not. The latter displayed behavioural differences in using the pack ice habitat during winter. Some females adjusted their movement patterns to the pulsating sea <b>ice</b> <b>fringe</b> in far-distant foraging areas while others ranged in closed pack ice of up to 100 %. The feeding grounds of adult female elephant seals are more closely associated with the pack ice zone than previously assumed.

60|$|Thick flakes beat on the windows, and icy {{draughts}} {{swept through}} the car, while the big stove in a boxed-in corner hummed with a drowsy roar. With half-closed eyes I {{leaned back against the}} hard maple while the preceding scenes of the long journey rolled like a panorama before me. Twelve days it took the ancient steamer, which swarmed like a hive, to thrash through mist and screaming gale across the Atlantic, while fifteen hundred emigrants below wished themselves dead. Then there followed an apparently endless transit in the lurching cars, where we slept as best we could on uncushioned seats and floor, through dark pine forests, with only an occasional tin-roofed hamlet to break the monotony. After that there were wooden cities in Ontario very much like the hamlets of a larger growth; and when at last sickened by the vibration, we sped out on to the long-expected prairie, the prospect was by no means inviting. Spring, I was told, was very late that year, and the plains rolled before us to the horizon a dreary white wilderness streaked by willow-swale, with at first many lonely lakes rippling a bitter steely-blue under the blasts, while crackling <b>ice</b> <b>fringed</b> their shores. Then several of my companions, who were young and romantic Britons with big revolvers strapped about them under their jackets, grew suspiciously quiet, and said no more about the strange adventures they had looked for in the West. There was nothing romantic about this land, which lacked even the clear skies Grace Carrington spoke of. It looked a hard country, out of which only a man with the power of stubborn endurance could wrest a living.|$|R
