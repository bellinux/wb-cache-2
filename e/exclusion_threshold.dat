40|$|Increasing {{concerns}} about the changing environment {{and the emergence of}} pathogens that cross species boundaries have added to the urgency of understanding the dynamics of complex ecological systems infected by pathogens. Of particular interest is the often counterintuitive way in which infection and predation interact and the consequent difficulties in designing control strategies to manage the system. To understand the mechanisms involved, we focus on the pathogen exclusion problem, using control maps (on which the network of <b>exclusion</b> <b>thresholds</b> are plotted) in order to readily identify which exclusion strategies will work and why others will not. We apply this approach to the analysis of parasite exclusion in two game bird ecologies. For higher dimensions, we propose a computational scheme that will generate the optimal exclusion strategy, taking into account all operational constraints on the pathogen invasion matrix, populations, and controls. The situation is further complicated when external forcing distorts pathogen thresholds. This distortion is highly sensitive to the lags between forcing components, a sensitivity that can be exploited by management using correctly lagged cyclically varying controls to reduce the effort involved in pathogen exclusion...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to focus on low-income {{families}} who are excluded from consumer culture. It explores their experiences and responses to material deprivation, social deprivation and stigmatization. Given the need for identification and calculation of <b>exclusion</b> <b>thresholds</b> to be supplemented by the voice of the excluded themselves, the study is based on qualitative analysis of 30 in-depth interviews with low-income families who encounter consumption constraints in the marketplace. While the harsh realities of consumer exclusion cannot be denied, findings also present a more positive outlook as excluded consumers can achieve empowerment through employment of stigma management strategies, creative consumer coping and rejection of the stigmatizing regime. Research is based only on families with children under the age of 18; future research on older people and exclusion would prove a useful comparison. The research raises a number of important policy issues in relation to social barriers to inclusion and the role of marketing in contributing to consumer exclusion. Social policy studies surrounding social exclusion in terms of separation from mainstream society tend to focus on employment. This paper highlights that a social exclusion discourse can also provide a useful perspective to investigate exclusion in relation to consumerism...|$|R

Genetic {{alteration}} of pore size and other {{properties of the}} Neurospora cell wall. J. Bacteriol. 92 : 1016 – 1020. 1966. —Several properties of the cell walls of wild type and the osmotic mutant of Neurospora crassa have been examined. The peameability of the isolated cell walls to polyethylene glycol and dextran polymers of different molecular weights was investigated by the volume of distribution technique. The <b>exclusion</b> <b>thresholds</b> were evaluated by a statistical treatment. The molecular weights corresponding to these thresholds for wild type and osmotic were approximately 4, 750 and 18, 500, respectively; these values are significantly different. The cell walls of osmotic appeared to be thinner, more easily broken, and more easily compressed to ribbonlike shapes, whereas those of wild type were tubular and strong. Chemical analysis showed that osmotic walls had roughly a 30 -fold higher galactosamine-glucosamine ratio than did wild type. It is proposed that the osmotic mutant has a cell wall with abnormally large pores, and that this {{may account for the}} increased rate of egress of invertase and the decreased fractionation of light from heavy invertase in this strain...|$|R
50|$|The {{next stage}} is to {{determine}} the initial number of seats assigned to the parties. As the Knesset employs a 3.25% <b>exclusion</b> <b>threshold,</b> and 3.25 times 1.2 (120 ÷ 100) equals 3.9, which is not a whole number, each party starts off with 4 seats and with a divisor 4.47 (the square root of the product of 4, the number seats currently assigned, and 5, the number of seats that would next be assigned). Each party's number of votes is divided by its D, to produce a priority value for each party. Since all of the Ds are equal for this first seat, the party with the largest vote share would win (Likud).|$|E
50|$|Unlike in the U.S. House of Representatives, {{where every}} state is {{guaranteed}} one seat, {{the first stage}} would be to calculate which parties are eligible for seats in the legislature.

Weight per cent uptake values (Rw) were measured at diffusional equilibrium under conditions that negated the influences of adsorption or active transport. Plots of Rw for intact cells {{as a function of}} number-average molecular weight (¯Mn) or Einstein-Stokes hydrodynamic radius (¯rES) of the solutes showed three phases: a protoplast uptake phase with a polydisperse <b>exclusion</b> <b>threshold</b> of ¯Mn = 0. 6 × 103 to 1. 1 × 103, ¯rES = 0. 6 to 1. 1 nm; a cell wall uptake phase with a polydisperse <b>exclusion</b> <b>threshold</b> of ¯Mn = 0. 7 × 105 to 1. 2 × 105, ¯rES ≅ 8. 3 nm; and a total exclusion phase. Isolated cell walls showed only the latter two phases. However, it became evident that the cell wall selectively passed only the smallest molecules in a heterodisperse polymer sample. When the molecular-weight distributions of polyglycol samples (¯Mn = 1, 000, 1, 450, and 3, 350) were determined by analytical gel chromatography before and after uptake by intact cells or isolated cell walls, a quasi-monodisperse <b>exclusion</b> <b>threshold</b> was obtained corresponding to Mn = 1, 200, rES = 1. 1 nm. The permeability of isolated protoplasts was assessed by the relative ability of solutes to effect osmotic stabilization. An indefinite <b>exclusion</b> <b>threshold,</b> evident even with monodisperse sugars, was attributed to lengthwise orientation of the penetrating rod-shaped molecules.

40|$|Although soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae), {{has caused}} {{economic}} damage in several Midwestern states, growers in Missouri have experienced relatively minor damage. To evaluate whether existing predatory insect populations {{are capable of}} suppressing or preventing soybean aphid population growth or establishment in Missouri, a predator exclusion {{study was conducted to}} gauge the efficacy of predator populations. Three levels of predator exclusion were used; one that excluded all insects (small mesh), one that excluded insects larger than thrips (medium mesh), and one that excluded insects larger than Orius insidiosus (Say) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae), a principal predator (large mesh). Along with manipulating predator exposure, timing of aphid arrival (infestation) was manipulated. Three infestation times were studied; vegetative (V 5), beginning bloom (R 1), and beginning pod set (R 3). Timing of aphid and predator arrival in a soybean field may affect the soybean aphid's ability to establish and begin reproducing. Cages infested at V 5 and with complete predator <b>exclusion</b> reached economic <b>threshold</b> within two weeks, while cages with predators reached economic threshold in four and a half weeks.

40|$|Overgrazing {{has caused}} {{vegetation}} destruction and soil degradation in Leymus chinensis grassland, the widely distributed type of grassland in northern China. To restore the degraded ecosystem, grazing exclusion was implemented in 1979, 1999, and 2004. However, {{changes in the}} vegetation and soil organic carbon (SOC) in different years of grazing exclusion have not been thoroughly elucidated. This paper examines the changes in vegetation characteristics (i. e., biomass, cover, richness, degree of succession, and shannon diversity index) and SOC under free of grazing (FG), 6 years (6 GE), 11 years (11 GE), and 31 years (31 GE) of grazing exclusion plots in the Xilin River Basin, China. The {{results indicate that the}} vegetation characteristics and SOC increased during the restoration process. Both the vegetation characteristics and SOC in 6 GE did not differ significantly from FG (p > 0. 05), while these indexes in 11 GE were significantly higher than in FG. The differences between the vegetation characteristics and SOC in 11 GE and those in 31 GE were not significant. To meet the tradeoff between ecosystem conservation and utilization, further studies with multi-year observation should be conducted to identify the optimal duration of grazing exclusion and the grazing <b>exclusion</b> time <b>threshold</b> in L. chinensis grassland.

40|$|Engagement of antigen receptors on mature B {{lymphocytes}} {{is known}} to block cell entry into lymphoid follicles and promote accumulation in T cell zones, yet the molecular basis for this change in cell distribution is not understood. Previous {{studies have shown that}} follicular <b>exclusion</b> requires a <b>threshold</b> level of antigen receptor engagement combined with occupancy of follicles by B cells without equivalent receptor engagement. The possibility has been raised that follicular composition affects B cell positioning by altering the amount of available antigen and the degree of receptor occupancy. Here we show that follicular composition affects migration of mature B cells under conditions that are independent of antigen receptor occupancy. B cells deficient in the negative regulatory protein tyrosine phosphatase, SHP 1, which have elevated intracellular signaling by the B cell receptor, are shown to accumulate in the T zone in the absence of their specific antigen. Follicular exclusion of SHP 1 –deficient B cells was found to be conditional on the presence of excess B cells that lack elevated intracellular signaling, and was not due to a failure of SHP- 1 –deficient cells to mature and express the follicle-homing chemokine receptor Burkitt’s lymphoma receptor 1.

Four lesions with similar size were consistently applied per eye at approximately double the disc diameter away from the optic nerve, using different laser power levels, and mice of various ages and genders.

Results Of 99 subjects with both paramedic and ED chart data available, most were male (89 %), homeless (57 %) and found on the street (81 %). Five were admitted and 13 others appeared to require ED care. Per consensus criteria, only 40 were eligible for triage to a sobering centre, but among those were five who appeared to require ED care (sensitivity 72 %, 95 % CI 47 % to 90 %; specificity 43 %, 95 % CI 32 % to 55 %). Paramedic opinion alone was specific (80 %) but not very sensitive (39 %). Lowering the pulse <b>exclusion</b> <b>threshold</b> from 130 to 83 would increase sensitivity to 100 %, but decrease specificity to 22 %.
