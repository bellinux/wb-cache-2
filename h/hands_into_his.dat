2500|$|In men's fashion, {{the long}} {{redingote}} {{of the era}} of Louis-Philippe (the name came from the English term [...] "riding-coat") was gradually replaced by the jacquette, and then the even shorter veston. [...] The shorter jacket allowed a man to put his <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> pockets. [...] The trousers were wide at the waist, and very narrow at the cuffs. Men wore a neutral-colored vest, usually cut low to show off highly decorated shirts with frills and buttons of paste jewellery. [...] Men had gloves, but carried them in their hands, according to Gaston Jolivet, a prominent fashion observer of the time, in order [...] "to prove to the population {{that they had the}} means to buy a pair of gloves without using them." ...|$|E
2500|$|John's gospel is {{the only}} {{canonical}} one that gives Thomas the Apostle a dramatic role and spoken part, and Thomas {{is the only}} character therein described as having apistos (unbelief), despite the failings of virtually all the Johannine characters {{to live up to}} the author's standards of belief. With respect to the famous story of [...] "Doubting Thomas", it is suggested that John may have been denigrating or ridiculing a rival school of thought. In another apparent contrast, John's text matter-of-factly presents a bodily resurrection as if this is a sine qua non of the faith; in contrast, Thomas' insights about the spirit-and-body are more nuanced. For Thomas, resurrection seems more a cognitive event of spiritual attainment, one even involving a certain discipline or asceticism. Again, an apparently denigrating portrayal in the [...] "Doubting Thomas" [...] story may either be taken literally, or as a kind of mock [...] "comeback" [...] to Thomas' logia: not as an outright censuring of Thomas, but an improving gloss. After all, Thomas' thoughts about the spirit and body are really not so different from those which John has presented elsewhere. John portrays Thomas as physically touching the risen Jesus, inserting fingers and <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> <b>his</b> body, and ending with a shout. Pagels interprets this as signifying one-upmanship by John, who is forcing Thomas to acknowledge Jesus' bodily nature. She writes that [...] "...he shows Thomas giving up his search for experiential truth – his 'unbelief' – to confess what John sees as the truth...". The point of these examples, as used by Riley and Pagels, is to support the argument that the text of Thomas must have existed and have gained a following at the time of the writing of John's Gospel, and that the importance of the Thomasine logia was great enough that John felt the necessity of weaving them into his own narrative.|$|E
