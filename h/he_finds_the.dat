6000|$|... "Did <b>he</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> {{new life}} {{all that he}} expected?" [...] I said, hesitating a little at the word did, as it was not {{impossible}} that I might be mistaken.|$|R

5|$|Wallace {{describes}} {{the island of}} Timor, its abundance of fan-palms, its people who are like Papuans, and the Portuguese government which he considers extremely poor. On some hills he finds Eucalyptus (gum) trees, a genus from Australia; <b>he</b> <b>finds</b> <b>the</b> vegetation monotonous also.|$|E
5|$|Wallace gives {{a lively}} {{description}} {{of the people of}} the town, and of the wildlife of the island. <b>He</b> <b>finds</b> <b>the</b> Chinese the most noticeable of the people, while in one square mile of forest he found 700 species of beetles including 130 longhorns.|$|E

5|$|<b>He</b> <b>finds</b> <b>the</b> {{mixture of}} bird species {{intermediate}} between those of Java and Australia, with 36 species actually Javan, and 11 closely related; {{while there are}} only 13 actually Australian, with 35 closely related. Wallace interprets this to mean that {{a small number of}} birds from Australia, and a larger number from Java, colonised Timor and then evolved into new species endemic to the island. The land mammals were very few in number: the six species were endemic or related to those of Java or the Moluccas, with none from Australia, so he doubts there was ever a land bridge to that continent.|$|E

5|$|Israeli writer Amos Oz {{writes in}} his {{biography}} A Tale of Love and Darkness that Winesburg, Ohio had a powerful influence on his writing, showing him that literature must not necessarily always be about heroes.

5|$|Toriyama enjoyed {{designing}} and drawing the distinctive machines of the series. <b>He</b> <b>finds</b> <b>the</b> most fun in designing original mecha, {{thinking about how}} a pilot enters and where the engine is. With real world items {{he would have to}} look at references, and being off even a little would be noticeable. He goes against whatever is popular at the time, explaining that when he was creating Dragon Ball, most cars were very square, so he drew only round car designs. He drew square ones later on when cars in reality started to become sleek and aerodynamic.|$|E

5|$|Writing in 2009, Biran {{suggests}} that De Stem des Bloeds was clearly written from an Indo {{point of view}} because of the positive roles of Indo children. <b>He</b> <b>finds</b> <b>the</b> film sympathetic to native culture, including the faithful njai. He notes with interest that, although in real life mixed-race children were faced {{with a sense of}} disgust, in De Stem des Bloeds an Indo man is heroic enough to rescue a pure Dutch woman and fight with a Dutchman.|$|E
