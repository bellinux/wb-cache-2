5|$|Grotthuss mechanism: how protons are {{transferred}} between <b>hydronium</b> ions and water molecules, {{accounting for the}} exceptionally high ionic mobility of the proton (animation).|$|E
5|$|Thus, the {{ammonium}} ion, , {{plays the}} same role in liquid ammonia as does the <b>hydronium</b> ion in water and the amide ion, , {{is analogous to the}} hydroxide ion. Ammonium salts behave as acids, and amides behave as bases.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, {{hydrogen}} bromide is a colourless gas, {{like all the}} hydrogen halides apart from hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the large and only mildly electronegative bromine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline {{hydrogen bromide}} at low temperatures, similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised. Aqueous hydrogen bromide is known as hydrobromic acid, which is a strong acid (pKa = −9) because the hydrogen bonds to bromine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HBr/H2O system also involves many hydrates HBr·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, which are essentially salts of bromine anions and <b>hydronium</b> cations. Hydrobromic acid forms an azeotrope with boiling point 124.3°C at 47.63g HBr per 100g solution; thus hydrobromic acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.|$|E
25|$|The <b>hydronium</b> ion is very acidic: at 25°C, its pKa is 0. It is {{the most}} acidic species that can exist in water (assuming {{sufficient}} water for dissolution): any stronger acid will ionize and protonate a water molecule to form <b>hydronium.</b> The acidity of <b>hydronium</b> is the implicit standard used to judge the strength of an acid in water: strong acids must be better proton donors than <b>hydronium,</b> otherwise {{a significant portion of}} acid will exist in a non-ionized state (i.e.: a weak acid). Unlike <b>hydronium</b> in neutral solutions that result from water's autodissociation, <b>hydronium</b> ions in acidic solutions are long-lasting and concentrated, in proportion to the strength of the dissolved acid.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydronium</b> ion H3O+ (pKa = −1.74). <b>Hydronium</b> {{is often}} used as an {{approximation}} {{of the state of}} protons in water.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydronium</b> is the cation {{that forms}} from {{water in the}} {{presence}} of hydrogen ions. These hydrons do not exist in a free state: they are extremely reactive and are solvated by water. An acidic solute is generally the source of these hydrons; however, hydroniums exist even in pure water. This special case of water reacting with water to produce <b>hydronium</b> (and hydroxide) ions is commonly known as the self-ionization of water. The resulting <b>hydronium</b> ions are few and short-lived. pH {{is a measure of the}} relative activity of <b>hydronium</b> and hydroxide ions in aqueous solutions. In acidic solutions, <b>hydronium</b> is the more active, its excess proton being readily available for reaction with basic species.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydronium</b> is an {{abundant}} molecular ion in {{the interstellar medium}} and is found in diffuse and dense molecular clouds {{as well as the}} plasma tails of comets. Interstellar sources of <b>hydronium</b> observations include the regions of Sagittarius B2, Orion OMC-1, Orion BN–IRc2, Orion KL, and the comet Hale–Bopp.|$|E
25|$|The acid must be {{stronger}} {{in aqueous solution}} than <b>hydronium</b> ions, so strong acids are acids with a pKa < minus&1.74. An example is HCl for which pKa = −6.3. This generally means that, in aqueous solution at standard temperature and pressure, the concentration of <b>hydronium</b> ions {{is equal to the}} concentration of strong acid introduced to the solution.|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{have yet}} to fully {{characterize}} the solvation of <b>hydronium</b> ion in water, in part because many different meanings of solvation exist. A freezing-point depression study determined that the mean hydration ion in cold water is approximately : on average, each <b>hydronium</b> ion is solvated by 6 water molecules which are unable to solvate other solute molecules.|$|E
25|$|The <b>hydronium</b> ion forms various weak {{complexes}} by hydrogen {{bonding with}} more water molecules.|$|E
25|$|This {{is a list}} {{of strong}} acids with pKa < minus&1.74, which is {{stronger}} than the <b>hydronium</b> ion, from strongest to weakest.|$|E
25|$|An oxonium ion is any ion with a {{trivalent}} oxygen cation. For example, a protonated {{hydroxyl group}} is an oxonium ion, {{but not a}} <b>hydronium</b> ion.|$|E
25|$|Deprotonation: Removal of a proton on the protonated {{nucleophile}} {{by water}} {{acting as a}} base forming the alcohol and a <b>hydronium</b> ion. This reaction step is fast.|$|E
25|$|The {{compound}} ZnCl2·½HCl·H2O may {{be prepared}} by careful precipitation from {{a solution of}} ZnCl2 acidified with HCl. It contains a polymeric anion (Zn2Cl5 −)n with balancing monohydrated <b>hydronium</b> ions, H5O2+ ions.|$|E
25|$|The {{removal of}} H+ from the HCl {{produces}} the chloride ion, Cl−, the conjugate {{base of the}} acid. The addition of H+ to the H2O (acting as a base) forms the <b>hydronium</b> ion, H3O+, the conjugate acid of the base.|$|E
25|$|According to IUPAC {{nomenclature}} {{of organic}} chemistry, the <b>hydronium</b> ion should {{be referred to}} as oxonium. Hydroxonium may also be used unambiguously to identify it. A draft IUPAC proposal also recommends the use of oxonium and oxidanium in organic and inorganic chemistry contexts, respectively.|$|E
25|$|This {{causes the}} {{protonation}} of water, or {{the creation of}} the <b>hydronium</b> (H3O+) ion. Thus, in modern times, the symbol H+ is interpreted as a shorthand for H3O+, because it is now known that a bare proton does not exist as a free species in aqueous solution.|$|E
25|$|In pure water, {{there is}} {{an equal number of}} {{hydroxide}} and <b>hydronium</b> ions, so it is a neutral solution. At 25°C, water has a pH of 7 (this varies when the temperature changes: see self-ionization of water). A pH value less than 7 indicates an acidic solution, and a pH value more than 7 indicates a basic solution.|$|E
25|$|Soil {{biology and}} {{chemistry}} can be seriously damaged by acid rain. Some microbes {{are unable to}} tolerate changes to low pH and are killed. The enzymes of these microbes are denatured (changed in shape so they no longer function) by the acid. The <b>hydronium</b> ions of acid rain also mobilize toxins such as aluminium, and leach away essential nutrients and minerals such as magnesium.|$|E
25|$|The self-{{ionization}} {{of water}} (also autoionization of water, and autodissociation of water) is an ionization reaction in pure water {{or in an}} aqueous solution, in which a water molecule, H2O, deprotonates (loses the nucleus {{of one of its}} hydrogen atoms) to become a hydroxide ion, OH−. The hydrogen nucleus, H+, immediately protonates another water molecule to form <b>hydronium,</b> H3O+. It is an example of autoprotolysis, and exemplifies the amphoteric nature of water.|$|E
25|$|A {{substance}} {{can often}} be classified as an acid or a base. There are several different theories which explain acid-base behavior. The simplest is Arrhenius theory, which states than an acid is a substance that produces <b>hydronium</b> ions when it is dissolved in water, and a base is one that produces hydroxide ions when dissolved in water. According to Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory, acids are substances that donate a positive hydrogen ion to another substance in a chemical reaction; by extension, a base is the substance which receives that hydrogen ion.|$|E
25|$|While Ka {{measures}} {{the strength of}} an acidic molecule, the strength of an aqueous acid solution is measured by pH, which {{is a function of}} the concentration of <b>hydronium</b> ions in solution. The pH of a simple solution of an acid in water is determined by both Ka and the acid concentration. For weak acid solutions, it depends on the degree of dissociation, which may be determined by an equilibrium calculation. For concentrated solutions of strong acids with a pH less than about zero, the Hammett acidity function is a better measure of acidity than the pH.|$|E
25|$|The {{strength}} of an acid refers to its ability or tendency {{to lose a}} proton (H+). A strong acid is one that completely ionizes (dissociates) in a solution (provided there is sufficient solvent). In water, one mole of a strong acid HA dissolves yielding one mole of H+ (as <b>hydronium</b> ion H3O+) and one mole of the conjugate base, A−. Essentially, none of the non-ionized acid HA remains. Examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydroiodic acid (HI), hydrobromic acid (HBr), perchloric acid (HClO4), nitric acid (HNO3) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4). In aqueous solution, each of these essentially ionizes 100%.|$|E
25|$|The plasma {{composition}} in Saturn's inner magnetosphere {{is dominated by}} the water group ions: O+, H2O+, OH+ and others, <b>hydronium</b> ion (H3O+), HO2+ and O2+, although protons and nitrogen ions (N+) are also present. The main source of water is Enceladus, which releases 300–600kg/s of water vapor from the geysers near its south pole. The released water and hydroxyl (OH) radicals (a product of water's dissociation) form a rather thick torus around the moon's orbit at 4Rs with densities up to 10,000 molecules per cubic centimeter. At least 100kg/s of this water is eventually ionized and added to the corotating magnetospheric plasma. Additional sources of water group ions are Saturn's rings and other icy moons. The Cassini spacecraft also observed small amounts of N+ ions in the inner magnetosphere, which probably originate from Enceladus as well.|$|E
500|$|Hydrochloric acid is {{the salt}} of <b>hydronium</b> ion, H3O+ and chloride. [...] It is usually {{prepared}} by treating HCl with water.|$|E
500|$|The {{strength}} of an earthquake {{is measured by}} taking the common logarithm of the energy emitted at the quake. This {{is used in the}} moment magnitude scale or the Richter magnitude scale. For example, a 5.0 earthquake releases 32 times [...] and a 6.0 releases 1000 times [...] the energy of a 4.0. Another logarithmic scale is apparent magnitude. It measures the brightness of stars logarithmically. Yet another example is pH in chemistry; pH is the negative of the common logarithm of the activity of <b>hydronium</b> ions (the form hydrogen ions [...] take in water). The activity of <b>hydronium</b> ions in neutral water is 10−7mol·L−1, hence a pH of 7. Vinegar typically has a pH of about 3. The difference of 4 corresponds to a ratio of 104 of the activity, that is, vinegar's <b>hydronium</b> ion activity is about [...]|$|E

500|$|... {{where in}} aqueous {{solution}} H+ or H+(aq) denotes a solvated proton. Often this is written as the <b>hydronium</b> ion H3O+, but this formula is not exact because in fact there is solvation {{by more than one}} water molecule and species such as H5O2+, H7O3+ and H9O4+ are also present.|$|E
2500|$|A 2007 {{calculation}} of the enthalpies and free energies of the various hydrogen bonds around the <b>hydronium</b> cation in liquid protonated water at room temperature and {{a study of the}} proton hopping mechanism using [...] molecular dynamics showed that the hydrogen-bonds around the <b>hydronium</b> ion (formed with the three water ligands in the first solvation shell of the <b>hydronium)</b> are quite strong compared to those of bulk water.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{the amount}} of <b>hydronium</b> ions {{relative}} to hydroxide ions that determines a solution's pH. [...] The molecules in pure water auto-dissociate (i.e.: react with each other) into <b>hydronium</b> and hydroxide ions in the following equilibrium: ...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>hydronium</b> ion also forms stable {{compounds}} {{with the}} carborane superacid [...] X-ray crystallography shows a C3v symmetry for the <b>hydronium</b> ion with each proton interacting with a bromine atom each from three carborane anions 320 pm apart on average.

In the cation three benzene molecules surround <b>hydronium</b> forming pi-cation interactions with the hydrogen atoms. The closest (non-bonding) approach of the anion at chlorine to the cation at oxygen is 348 pm.|$|E

No acid species stronger than H3O+(aq) can exist in aqueous solution, as any stronger acid is converted to H3O+. The acidity of the stronger acid is said to be leveled to the acidity of <b>hydronium</b> ion.|$|E
