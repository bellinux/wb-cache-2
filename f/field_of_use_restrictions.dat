The royalty rate is determined from comparing competing or similar technologies in an industry, modified by considerations of useful [...] "remaining life" [...] of the technology in that industry and contracting elements such as exclusivity provisions, front-end royalties, <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>restrictions,</b> geographic limitations and the [...] "technology bundle" [...] (the mix of patents, know-how, trade-mark rights, etc.) accompanying it. Economist J. Gregory Sidak explains that comparable licenses, when selected correctly, [...] "reveal what the licensor and the licensee consider to be fair compensation {{for the use of the}} patented technology" [...] and thus [...] "will most accurately depict the price that a licensee would willingly pay for that technology." [...] The Federal Circuit has on numerous occasions confirmed that the comparable market approach is a reliable methodology to calculate a reasonable royalty.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{describe}} and analyse the significance of economic thinking and arguments {{in the treatment of}} licence agreements in EC competition law. A central question is to what degree the concept of competition in EC law reflects an economically realistic approach to competition. The study also investigates to what degree the economic functioning of intellectual property is considered in competition regulation and how much the economic functioning of the licence agreement is considered. The investigation mainly consists of a comparative analysis of EC competition law and American antitrust law concerning the economic arguments and their importance. The treatment of territorial restrictions, <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>restrictions,</b> quantity clauses, tie-outs, tie-ins, grant back, no-challenge clauses and price restrictions are of special interest here. This study shows that an economically realistic view of competition has influenced current EC competition law, especially in the Technology Transfer Block Exemption Regulation (TTBER). Exceptions from this development in the EC law are mainly due to the goal of integration of the common market. Territorial restrictions are strictly regulated in the TTBER even when the parties’ market shares are below the market thresholds defined in the regulation. The function of intellectual property rights are not much considered in EC competition law but there are general remarks about the economic functioning of patents in the Guidelines for the TTBER. However, it is difficult to find evidence for economic reasoning about patents in the formation of concrete rules. On the contrary, patents are weakened by the widened concept of exhaustion presented in the Guidelines. The economic functioning of the licence agreement is considered in the rules of TTBER and the economic arguments for clauses which create incentives for making investments or give the possibility of control are acknowledged. However, the free riding argument has a weak position when applied to territorial restrictions, which are more formalistically regulated. The EC competition law has become more similar to American antitrust law. The decisive difference consists in the judicial treatment of territorial restrictions, where the goal of integration is still of central importance in EC law...|$|E
40|$|Patents on genetically {{modified}} (GM) crop technology arm their owners with powerful control over farmers 2 ̆ 7 ability to grow, harvest, distribute, and profit from GM crops. No clearer example exists than the April 2004 {{decision of the}} U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Monsanto Co. v. McFarling, in which the court upheld Monsanto 2 ̆ 7 s licensing practice of forbidding farmers to save seed from patented GM crops for replanting. By forcing farmers to buy new GM seed each season, the McFarling II decision disproportionately impacts small farmers and concentrates GM crop growth among larger agribusinesses better positioned to bear the financial burden. Notably, the McFarling II court 2 ̆ 7 s finding of no misuse by Monsanto was conditioned on the unique circumstance that Monsanto 2 ̆ 7 s patents cover both the first-generation GM seed and the second-generation crop grown therefrom. Absent such facts, McFarling II strongly suggests that a <b>use</b> <b>restriction</b> on goods made by, yet not incorporating, a licensed good is not a legitimate <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>restriction.</b> That Monsanto prevailed {{in this case is}} certainly consistent with the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s propensity to side with patent owners facing a patent misuse defense. Nevertheless, the court 2 ̆ 7 s summary dismissal of McFarling 2 ̆ 7 s affirmative tying allegation under the antitrust laws bears further scrutiny, as does McFarling 2 ̆ 7 s charge that the patent exhaustion doctrine limits Monsanto 2 ̆ 7 s ability to enforce post-sale <b>restrictions</b> on the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> its patented GM seed...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is the {{analysis}} <b>of</b> genetic <b>use</b> <b>restriction</b> technologies (GURTs) {{from the perspective of the}} diffusion of crop improvements to developing countries. One of the possible consequences <b>of</b> genetic <b>use</b> <b>restriction</b> technologies is a distinct downward shift in the growth trajectories of agricultural productivity in developing countries by restricting the flow of innovations to which these countries have had access in the past. In this case, developing countries are likely to face cumulative losses in agricultural productivity growth as a result of widespread adoption of GURTs by crop innovators. This paper presents the results of a study on hybrid crops, a precursor technology, to establish the negative effect <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>restriction</b> technologies on diffusion and discusses the implications <b>of</b> widespread <b>use</b> <b>of</b> GURTs for developing countries.

40|$|The {{dominant}} view of antitrust {{policy in}} the United States {{is that it is}} intended to promote some version of economic welfare. More specifically, antitrust promotes allocative efficiency by ensuring that markets are as competitive as they can practicably be, and that firms do not face unreasonable roadblocks to attaining productive efficiency, which refers to both cost minimization and innovation. The distribution concern that has dominated debates over United States antitrust policy over the last several decades is whether antitrust should adopt a “consumer welfare” principle rather than a more general neoclassical “total welfare” principle. In The Antitrust Paradox Robert Bork famously argued that antitrust law should adopt what he termed a “consumer welfare” standard for illegality, but then equated this standard with general welfare. “Total welfare” refers to the aggregate value that an economy produces, without regard for way that gains or losses are distributed. The consumer welfare test is not a balancing test, in the sense that one must attempt to measure efficiency gains and losses and net them out. Under the test, if consumers are harmed (either by reduced output or product quality, or by higher prices resulting from the exercise of market power), then this fact trumps any offsetting gains to producers and, presumably, to others. Theoretically, even a minor injury to consumers outweighs significant efficiency gains. In this sense the consumer welfare test can be easier to administer on a case by case basis than general welfare tests. Even the consumer welfare test can be difficult to administer, however, when a practice impacts different groups of consumers differently. Practices that involve price discrimination, such as variable proportion ties or patent <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>restrictions,</b> typically have this result. The volume and complexity of the academic debate on the antitrust welfare definition creates an impression of policy significance that is completely belied by the case law, and largely by government enforcement policy. Few if any decisions have turned on the difference. In fact, antitrust policy generally applies both tests in the following sense. First, the economic analysis from the dominant Harvard and Chicago schools of antitrust is consistently concerned with general welfare, although the schools entertain different assumptions about the robustness of markets and the merits of intervention. Harvard School antitrust economists began to look at total welfare consequences at least as early as the 1930 s. The Chicago School has likewise consistently followed a total welfare approach, ignoring distributional concerns and focusing {{on the extent to which}} practices are likely to impose welfare losses in the neoclassical sense. However, if the evidence in a particular case indicates that a challenged practice facilitates the exercise of market power, resulting in output that is actually lower and prices that are actually higher, then tribunals uniformly condemn the restraint without regard to offsetting efficiencies. Indeed, I have not been able to find a single appellate decision that made a fact finding that a challenged practice resulted in lower market wide output and higher prices, but that also went on to approve the restraint because proven efficiencies exceeded consumer losses...|$|E

Fifteen ranchers employed a total of 330 collars in field use. Two used collars in preventive control schemes and success was unknown. Thirteen used collars in corrective control (i. e. predation was in progress); 6 had collared lambs attacked and killed by coyotes; 4 had 1 or more collars punctured by coyotes and in 1 case a bobcat; 3 solved specific coyote problems that {{they were unable to}} solve by other means. Although punctured collars were not recovered for verification, 2 other ranchers were believed to have stopped killer coyotes based on circumstantial evidence. Two ranchers were found to be in violation <b>of</b> <b>use</b> <b>restrictions</b> during the 2 -year program.
