40|$|Finding analogical <b>inspirations</b> {{in distant}} domains is a {{powerful}} way of solving problems. However, {{as the number of}} <b>inspirations</b> that could be matched and the dimensions on which that matching could occur grow, it becomes challenging for designers to find <b>inspirations</b> relevant to their needs. Furthermore, designers are often interested in exploring specific aspects of a product [...] for example, one designer might be interested in improving the brewing capability of an outdoor coffee maker, while another might wish to optimize for portability.
