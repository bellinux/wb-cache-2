40|$|Purpose. To {{quantify}} {{the density of}} the cortical bone of the tibia in the area of reparative regeneration and the state of the vascular bed (hemodynamics) of the operated limb under intramedullary osteosynthesis using pins coated with titanium and <b>hafnium</b> <b>nitrides.</b> Materials and methods. In the experiment, changes in the bone density and the characteristics of the local blood supply were studied on 40 outbred rabbits which underwent intramedullary osteosynthesis by the use of pins with a nanocoating based on superhard compounds which consist of titanium and <b>hafnium</b> <b>nitrides</b> and pins without a coating. Using color Doppler mode helped to evaluate the condition of the vascular bed proximally to the fracture site. Results. It is noted that the use of pins with the described coating above did not violate the osteoregeneration staging. The density of the cortical bone in the test group exceeded that of the comparison group by an average of 30 %. Bone remodeling processes in the test group completed at an earlier date, as determined by the higher rates of its density. In the study of the vascular bed of the operated limb, it was found that on the 10 th day of the experiment, an increase in the maximal velocity of the blood flow was recorded (TAMAX). In animals of the test group this index approached preoperative values on the 30 th day, while in animals of the comparison group this index approached the initial values only by the 60 th day. Conclusion. The use of implants coated with titanium and <b>hafnium</b> <b>nitrides</b> which are characterized by high strength, thermal and chemical stability is accompanied by the formation of a cortical bone in the area of osteotomy with higher density characteristics. The changes which are typical of the vasodilatation in the area of injury in the early postoperative period can be regarded as a positive factor in the formation of primary bone union. In the group where implants coated with titanium and <b>hafnium</b> <b>nitrides</b> were used, the return of the parameters to the values of intact bone occurred at an earlier date than in the group with uncoated implants...|$|R
40|$|By X-ray {{computed}} tomography (CT), density {{characteristics of the}} tibiae bones in 25 experimental adult male rats were studied after their tibiae bones have experimentally fractured and then repaired by osteosynthesis using different implants. According to the data that was obtained by {{computed tomography}}, it has been defined that bone densities depend {{on the type of}} the implant and the chemical composition of the coating which is applied {{on the surface of the}} implant. Thus, average values of the density of the tibiae bones in the experimental rats with implants coated with a combination of titanium and <b>hafnium</b> <b>nitrides</b> were not different from the density values of the intact bones. At the same time, the densities of the tibiae in rats with implants made of copper and implants coated with a combination of titanium and zirconium nitrides were 1. 5 - 2 times lower than those of the intact bones. This leads us to conclude that implants coated with titanium and <b>hafnium</b> <b>nitrides</b> are biologically and chemically inert because less pathologic changes in the bone tissue were observed, in contrast to the copper-based implants and those where the coating contains zirconium. ...|$|R

This paper conducts a review of how to optimize the {{concentrated solar power}} plant by increasing the stored energy capacity or by stabilizing the absorptance and emittance in the solar absorber. The additional stages in the CSP may increase thermal efficiency. The stages consist of two oriented solar absorber to create superheated steam fed to the steam turbine and one regenerator to optimally regenerate heat for working fluid before pumped to solar absorber. A suitable treatment for superheated steam from solar absorber can optimally supply the turbine with a continually stable steam. The continuous stable steam can be controlled using steam accumulator right before the superheated steam fed into turbine. The thermal energy storage in the cycle can be optimally selected based on the stored energy capacity per kg of compared material used.

50|$|In {{comparison}} with carbide and nitride-based ceramics, diboride-based UHTCs exhibit higher thermal conductivity (refer to Table 2, {{where we can}} see that hafnium diboride has thermal conductivity of 105, 75, 70 W/m*K at different temperature while <b>hafnium</b> carbide and <b>nitride</b> have values only around 20W/m*K). Thermal shock resistance of HfB2 and ZrB2 was investigated by ManLabs and it was found that these materials did not fail at thermal gradients sufficient for the failure of SiC; indeed, it was found that hollow cylinders could not be cracked by an applied radial thermal gradient without first being notched on the inner surface. UHTCs generally exhibit thermal expansion coefficients in the range of 5.9-8.3 × 10−6 K−1.The structural and thermal stability of ZrB2 and HfB2 UHTCs results from the occupancy of bonding and antibonding levels in hexagonal MB2 structures with alternating hexagonal sheets of metal and boride atoms. In such structures, the principal frontier electronic states are bonding and antibonding orbitals resulting from bonding between boron 2p orbitals and metal d orbitals; before group (IV), the number of available electrons in a unit cell is insufficient to fill all bonding orbitals, and beyond it they begin to fill the antibonding orbitals. Both effects reduce the overall bonding strength in the unit cell and therefore the enthalpy of formation and melting point. Experimental evidence shows that as one moves across the transition metal series in a given period, the enthalpy of formation of MB2 ceramics increases and peaks at Ti, Zr, and Hf before decaying as the metal gets heavier. As a result, the enthalpies of formation of several important UHTCs are as follows: HfB2 > TiB2 > ZrB2 > TaB2 > NbB2 > VB2.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{describes the}} development of ALD processes for the deposition of nitride materials including tantalum, <b>hafnium</b> and gadolinium <b>nitrides.</b> Ta and Hf nitrides are of significant interests for sub-l 00 nm silicon based electronic devices, while Gd nitride may be exploitable in future spintronic devices. ALD has been established a key manufacturing tool in microelectronics, {{the development of}} ALD processes for these nitrides are essential for future manufacturing of electronic devices and can benefit future manufacturing of spintronic devices. In the current research, these nitrides were deposited using ALD and the films were characterised using MEIS, AES, XRD, TEM, SEM, AFM, and a four point probe. Ta nitride films were grown at temperatures ranging from 200 °C to 375 °C using ALD with Pentakis(dimethylamino) tantalum, Ta(NMe 2) s as the metal source and either ammonia or monomethyl-hydrazine (MMH) as a nitrogen eo-reactant. Self-limiting behaviour was observed for both ammonia and MMH processes, with growth rates of 0. 6 and 0. 4 A/cycle respectively at 300 °C. Films deposited using ammonia {{were found to have}} a mono-nitride stoichiometry with a cubic microstructure and resistivities as low as 70 mfz. cm. In contrast, films deposited using MMH were found to be nitrogen rich Ta 3 Ns with an amorphous microstructure and high resistivities (> 4 O. cm). A QCM was used to measure mass gain and loss during the cyclic ALD processes and the data was used in combination with MEIS to elucidate the Ta(NMe 2) s absorption mechanisms. For Hf nitride, films were firstly deposited using thermal ALD with tetrakis(dimethyl amino) hafnium, Hf(NMe 2) 4 and ammonia between 100 and 400 °C. Self- limiting behaviour was observed, however, the films exhibit a low density and were prone to oxidation during post-deposition exposure to air. A comparison between thermal and PE ALD was then made at 300 °C with tetrakis(ethylmethylamino) hafnium, Hf(NEtMe) 4 as the metal source and either molecular or plasma-cracked ammonia as a nitrogen source. PEALD allows shorter purge time, which significantly reduces the cycle length; PEALD also results in higher film density. The densities of the films deposited by PEALD and thermal ALD were found to be 11. 6 and 9. 7 g/cm'' respectively. Mass spectroscopy indicates that the process characteristics in PEALD are attributed {{to the nature of the}} eo-reactants, namely, radicals of hydrogen and nitrogen. Their high reactivity and short life time are responsible for the resulted high density and the short required purge time. All films deposited were found to be insulators and with an amorphous microstructure. The films deposited by PEALD remain amorphous and stable with no interactions between Hf and Si after vacuum annealing up to 800 °C. Gd nitride films were successfully deposited using a cyclic PEALD based process. The deposition was carried out with tris(methylcyclopentadienyl) gadolinium, Od(MeCp) 3, and remote nitrogen plasma exposure, separated by argon pulses. Films were deposited at temperatures between 150 and 300 °C and capped with Ta nitride to prevent post deposition oxidation. Gd nitride with a 1 : 1 Od:N ratio, low oxygen incorporation (5 %), good thickness uniformity (95 %), an amorphous microstructure and smooth surface (Ra. =~ 0. 7 nm) have been deposited. Deposition with tris(silylamide) gadolinium, Od{N(SiMe 3 hh, and either ammonia or MMH was also investigated. Although the process using ammonia was unsuccessful due to the insufficient reactivity of ammonia, the results show that a reaction between Od{N(SiMe 3) 2 h and MMh does take place.

Prior to this program, Dr. Sproul had demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} apply hard coatings such as titanium nitride (TiN) to alloy steels at low temperatures via the HRRS process without changing the metallurgical properties of the steel. The NASA MSFC program at BIRL had the specific objectives to: apply TiN to 440 C stainless steel without changing the metallurgical properties of the steel; prepare rolling contact fatigue (RCF) test samples coated with binary hard coatings of TiN, zirconium nitride (ZrN), <b>hafnium</b> <b>nitride</b> (HfN), chromium nitride (CrN), and molybdenum nitride (MoN), and metal coatings of copper (Cu) and gold (Au); and develop new alloyed hard coatings of titanium aluminum nitride (Ti(0. 5) Al(0. 5) N), titanium zirconium nitride (Ti(0. 5) Zr(0. 5) N), and titanium aluminum vanadium nitride...|$|E
40|$|Side-on bound dinitrogen {{complexes}} of zirconium and hafnium, [([eta] 5 C 5 Me 3 H 2) 2 M] 2 ([eta] 2, [eta] 2 -N 2) (M = Zr, Hf), {{have been}} prepared by alkali metal reduction of the corresponding diiodide precursors. UV-Visible spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction studies established {{a higher degree of}} N 2 activation in these complexes than those of the type [([eta] 5 -C 5 Me 4 H) 2 M] 2 ([eta] 2, [eta] 2 -N 2) (M = Zr, Hf), likely due to increased metal-nitrogen orbital overlap resulting from contracted metal-metal distances. Addition of four atmospheres of dihydrogen afforded the expected hydrido metallocene azenido complexes [([eta] 5 -C 5 Me 3 H 2) 2 MH] 2 N 2 H 2 (M = Zr, Hf). The iodo hafnocene azenido compound [([eta] 5 -C 5 Me 3 H 2) 2 HfI] 2 N 2 H 2 was obtained by treatment of the hydrido hafnocene azenido precursor with methyl iodide. The first example of an bridging <b>hafnium</b> <b>nitride</b> compound, [([eta] 5 -C 5 Me 3 H 2) 2 Hf(DMAP) ]([MICRO SIGN]-N) [([eta] 5 -C 5 Me 3 H 2) 2 Hf(NCO) ], was isolated upon treatment of [([eta] 5 -C 5 Me 3 H 2) 2 Hf] 2 ([eta] 2, [eta] 2 -N 2) with carbon monoxide gas in the presence of 4 -dimethylaminopyridine. The molecule proved {{to be a source of}} the hafnium-nitride fragment, which reacted with terminal alkynes via 1, 2 -addition at elevated temperatures and furnished the [MICRO SIGN]-imido acetylido complexes [([eta] 5 C 5 Me 3 H 2) 2 Hf(CCR) ]([MICRO SIGN]-NH) [([eta] 5 -C 5 Me 3 H 2) 2 Hf(NCO) ] (R = Ph, SiMe 3). The <b>hafnium</b> <b>nitride</b> has also been shown to react with an additional molecule of carbon monoxide to yield the [MICRO SIGN]-isocyanate isocyanato compound [([eta] 5 -C 5 Me 3 H 2) 2 Hf]([eta] 3, [eta] 1, [MICRO SIGN]-NCO) [([eta] 5 C 5 Me 3 H 2) 2 Hf(NCO) ]. The hafnocene-N 2 complex also undergoes a unique series of reactions with primary silanes, leading to the production of monosilylated dinitrogen units. Complete N-N bond scission is achieved upon thermoylsis of the mono-silylated compounds, and N-C bond formation can be achieved by upon treatment of the silylated compound with CO. Trapping of the hafnium [MICRO SIGN]-nitride and N 2 functionalization with silanes are reactions which are unique to the 1, 2, 4 -trimethylcyclopentadienyl hafnocene-N 2 compound. The origin of this unique reactivity has been attributed to the reduced steric profile of the trisubstituted metallocene, which allows shorter metalmetal contact distances and produces a highly activated, but sterically accessible dinitrogen fragment...|$|E
40|$|Vanadium and <b>hafnium</b> <b>nitride</b> {{nanoscale}} {{films were}} synthesized onto (100) -oriented silicon wafers by reactive dc-magnetron sputtering. The {{temperature of the}} substrate was fixed at 150  °C. Several analysis techniques were used to characterize the resulting films: Wave Dispersion Spectroscopy (WDS) to determine nitrogen concentration, X-ray Diffraction (XRD) to study crystallographic structures, X-ray Reflectivity (XRR) to estimate their thicknesses and finally optical spectrophotometry (UV-Vis-IR) to measure the optical reflectance. The experimental conditions were selected {{in order to achieve}} two goals. The first one is to obtain ultra thin films (in the nanoscale range). The second one is to compare two symmetric systems, in terms of stoichiometry: over-stoichiometric hafnium nitrides and sub-stoichiometric vanadium nitrides. The XRR results showed that all synthesized films approximately presented the same thickness in the nanoscale range (less than 70  nm). The nitrogen concentration, measured by means of WDS, was in the sub-stoichiometric region for vanadium nitrides (N/V atomic ratio between 0. 78 and 0. 83) and over-stoichiometric region for hafnium nitrides (N/Hf atomic ratio between 1. 18 and 1. 25). From XRD patterns, the crystallographic film structure was found to be of NaCl type for the two systems, δ-VN and δ-HfN, with an amorphous part in the first system. Optical constants were derived from experimental reflectance spectra. Good agreement was found between experimental and calculated reflectance spectra using Drude and extended Drude models.

40|$|The {{thermodynamics}} and kinetics {{of reactions}} between <b>hafnium</b> <b>nitride</b> (HfN), zirconium nitride (ZrN), and graphite with a quaternary salt of composition LiCl-KCl-NaCl-UCl 3 were assessed. Coupons {{of each of}} the three refractory materials were exposed to the quaternary salt at 525 to 900 °C for 4 to 485 hours. The oxygen partial pressure was maintained at 10 - 8 atm of O 2 in most experiments. A limited number of experiments were also conducted at a higher oxygen partial pressure of 10 - 4 atm of O 2 in order to assess the effects of atmosphere on the reaction kinetics. The reaction kinetics of the salt-refractory interactions was assessed through physical and microstructural characterization including optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Salts were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy. It was found that both HtN and ZrN lose weight under all conditions investigated while graphite exhibited relatively small weight increases. In the case of HtN and ZrN, the reaction kinetics was complex. In both materials, simultaneous dissolution and oxidation were observed. While multiple mechanisms were evident, it is proposed that oxygen enrichment at the surface tends to inhibit dissolution in the molten salt. It is speculated that the internal oxygen in the base nitrides diffuses to the surface and provides a more corrosion-resistant interface. A negative activation energy for the overall dissolution process was observed in both HtN and ZrN. This seemingly anomalous activation energy was associated with the competition between surface oxide formation and dissolution. The Graphite showed little or no evidence of reacting with the molten salt. The small weight gains observed were associated with diffusion of salt into native porosity in the as received material. It was found that increasing the oxygen partial pressure increased the rate of dissolution of the nitrides, but has no statistically significant effect on the reactions with graphite. It is proposed that the atmospheric oxygen reacts with UCl 3 in the salt producing UO 2 and Cl 2 (g), the gaseous product of which may accelerate dissolution...|$|E
40|$|The {{hot carrier}} solar cell (HCSC) is a device concept for {{photovoltaics}} {{that has the}} potential to achieve high power conversion efficiencies. The HCSC aims to capture the energy of hot carriers that is otherwise lost to the lattice as heat, as in conventional solar cell devices. This relies on the photon absorbing material to maintain hot carriers for sufficiently long time for extraction through energy selective contacts. While HCSCs have been extensively studied theoretically, a practical device has yet to be fabricated. A reason for this is the lack of absorber materials available that exhibit sufficiently slow thermalisation rates. This research aims to solve this problem by finding a suitable absorber material and subsequently develop a working HCSC. <b>Hafnium</b> <b>nitride</b> (HfN) and its phonon properties have lead it to be identified as a potential photon absorbing material for the HCSC. This research was focused on exploring the prospects of using HfN as the absorber. This work involved developing deposition processes for HfN thin films by reactive sputtering such as determining the relative nitrogen and argon gas flow rates. Characterisation of HfN thin films was performed to judge the quality of the material and its potential {{to be used as a}} hot carrier absorber. This included X-ray Diffraction to study material quality. It is possible for single crystalline films to be deposited on MgO substrates whereas it is polycrystalline on Si and quartz substrates. Raman spectroscopy and Inelastic X-ray Scattering was performed to study the phonon properties of HfN. The HfN thin films exhibited the large phononic gap between optical and acoustic modes, consistent with predicted values, which influences the hot carrier lifetimes in materials. The carrier dynamics were investigated in a number of HfN thin films by means of ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. Observed in these measurements in HfN are hot carrier lifetimes on the order of several hundred picoseconds to nanoseconds. These properties of HfN suggest it to be a good candidate absorber for the HCSC. However there are other technical challenges to be resolved before a practical HCSC utilising HfN can be realised such as light trapping and issues around hot carrier collection...|$|E
