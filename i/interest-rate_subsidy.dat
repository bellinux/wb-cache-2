Indeed, petroleum derivatives saw the greatest rates of annual growth over the ensuring years. The railway was now proving itself to be an excellent investment, and even more ardent opponents to the project were finally forced to admit its worth. As a result of favourable public opinion and excellent performance, the Koper line was officially incorporated into the national rail network. At the same time the state committed itself to an <b>interest-rate</b> <b>subsidy</b> on loans raised for the development of port infrastructure, an action which greatly relieved the company's debt burden, particularly as regards the financing of the railway and port infrastructure. Accelerated development, and the large liabilities accrued through such ceaseless investment, affected cash flow and solvency. Employment conditions deteriorated, which led to a large turnover in personnel: 703 new workers were employed in 1969, while 490 also left the company. Due to the shortage of domestic labour, workers were brought in from other Yugoslav Republics. All of these conditions concerted negatively on Luka Koper's operations, and the countermeasures adopted ameliorated the situation only slightly.|$|E
40|$|Interest-rate {{subsidies}} {{have been}} used to stimulate commodity stockholding, with the intention of stabilizing prices. However, reductions in price variability can be achieved at less government cost using a direct storage subsidy, and it is possible that an <b>interest-rate</b> <b>subsidy</b> will increase price variability even though the interest subsidy increases mean stocks held. These results are demonstrated using a stochastic dynamic programming model of optimal private storage, with parameter values relevant to agricultural commodity markets, and with particular reference to the U. S. soybean market. Copyright 1996, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the cost to}} the Czech state budget of the Supporting and Guarantee Agricultural and Forestry Fund (SGAFF). In the empirical part of the paper, the author shows that the SGAFF portfolio has sufficient value to cover the expected costs of the credit guarantees and subsidies offered by the fund. The theoretical model looks at government interventions designed to decrease the credit rationing of farmers with high probability of success. The theoretical model shows that, with uniform non-targeted supports, the Czech government unambiguously prefers lump-sum guarantees to <b>interest-rate</b> <b>subsidies.</b> With support targeted wholly to disadvantaged farmers, the cost of lump-sum guarantees, proportional guarantees, and <b>interest-rates</b> <b>subsidies</b> are all equal. credit; guarantees; subsidies; transition...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{a simple}} {{model of the}} credit market, based on Stiglitz–Weiss (1981), equilibria are {{computed}} and optimal policies to correct market failures are characterized. Some widely applied policies, notably <b>interest–rate</b> <b>subsidies</b> and investment subsidies, are compared to theoretical optimum, and an alternative optimal policy is described which we argue is more robust to model misspecification. An insight on the trade–off between credit policy and infrastructural investment is also offered. A discussion of some aspects of regional policy in Italy’s Mezzogiorno is finally presented as an application of the analysis...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{measures}} the redistribution of financial and physical resources to different regions is Yugoslavia {{that arise from}} tax exemptions, <b>interest-rate</b> <b>subsidies,</b> and price distortions. Despite, {{or perhaps because of}} the lower marginal productivity of capital in less-developed regions, the result of policies adopted between 1966 and 1990 has been a substantial net flow to these regions. To equalize the marginal product of capital across regions in 1972, a one-time transfer of 45 % of the capital stock from the less-developed regions would have been required. Yet the appropriate regional policy to realize this objective was not fully adopted by Yugoslav leaders. ...|$|R
40|$|Several {{empirical}} {{studies suggest that}} advanced economies experiencea growth regime switch from factor accumulation to knowledgeaccumulation. To investigate the mechanism of such a regime switch,this study develops a concise and flexible dynamic model based onRomer (1990) by introducing two types of endogenously supplied R&Dinput capital. The model replicates the growth patterns of developedand underdeveloped nations, clarifies the important role that capitalplays in the difference between them, and presents several implicationsfor <b>interest-rate</b> <b>subsidies</b> and official development assistance. Further, it shows that if a country enjoying long-run growth has littleinitial capital, its initial economic development will be based oncapital accumulation. When the capital stock becomes sufficient forsupporting R&D, the economy will achieve long-run growth throughR&D...|$|R
40|$|Credit {{subsidies}} in targeted {{industrial sectors}} or geographical areas are a primary mechanism {{of industrial and}} redistributive policy throughout the world. Using a unique panel of bank-firm relationships, we study the impact of <b>interest-rate</b> <b>subsidies</b> on {{the total amount of}} borrowing and on the average cost of borrowing for subsidised firms. Even though they seem to promote the rise of new bank firm relationships, subsidies have a relatively small effect on the total amount of borrowing when granted to existing clients. We also find evidence of a spillover effect of subsidies on non-subsidised interest rates, which is suggestive of possible rent-seeking activities undertaken by banks and their targeted borrowers. The size of the subsidy, the bank`s local market power, her informational advantage and the length of the bank-client relationship are found to be important determinants of the spillover effect. funding gaps, credit subsidies, relationship lending, dynamic panel data models...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{evaluates the}} impact on {{employment}} dynamics of four programs implemented in Lombardy (Italy) and providing financial incentives to firms on the period 2008 - 2013. A counterfactual analysis is performed, via coarsened exact matching, that allows for multi treatment cases, distinguishing the effects of single programs and taking into account different possible levels of incentives. Linear estimates suggest that the programs {{have a positive effect}} on short-run employment growth only when the amount of financial incentives is sufficiently high; moreover, the efficacy seems to increase when the incentives take the form of <b>interest-rate</b> <b>subsidies,</b> instead of capital grants. A non-linear representation of the policy effects, on the contrary, shows that the result of public intervention is, on the whole, negative or non-significant, and that the positive estimates in the linear models are due to small groups of outliers, which received very high subsidies. Thanks to this new methodological tool, the results of the vast majority of the literature about the impact of public subsidies on job creation are confirmed and strengthened. Data allow for a short-run analysis only, but the results cast some doubts on the effectiveness of the programs also in a medium-long run perspective...|$|R
