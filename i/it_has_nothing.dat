He calls on those who done it to be punishable with death for their crime; a life for a life.|$|E
25|$|Poirot {{is asked}} for {{assistance}} {{by a young}} lady, Diana Maberly. She was engaged to marry Hugh Chandler {{for over a year}} but he has broken it off as he thinks he is going mad. There is a history of insanity in the family, with his grandfather and a great aunt being afflicted, and his father, Admiral Chandler, has insisted his son leave the Navy before his condition gets worse but the reason was hidden under the pretext of having to manage the family country estate – a reason no one believed, including Colonel Frobisher, a family friend and Hugh's godfather. At Poirot's prompting, Diana admits that there have been some unusual occurrences on nearby farms with the throats of sheep cut and the like but insists <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with the situation. The Admiral refuses to let a doctor see his son.|$|E

500|$|... "Black Swan" [...] was {{originally}} {{intended as a}} special edition bonus track for United Abominations. According to Ellefson, finishing and including [...] "Black Swan" [...] on Thirteen was Johnny K's idea. Ellefson also noted that, having been written several years beforehand, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> {{to do with the}} 2010 film of the same name; the lyrics were inspired by the C.S. Lewis novel The Great Divorce. In part of the effort to promote the album, the song was released for streaming via Hot Topic's official YouTube page on October 24, 2011.|$|E
500|$|In 1994 Electronic Gaming Monthly complimented the Lynx version's {{large number}} of options and {{password}} feature, and remarked, [...] "Lemmings {{has always been a}} good strategy game, and the Lynx version continues the tradition." [...] The following year they reviewed the CD-i version, criticising that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> but the obligatory full-motion video intro to set it apart from the numerous ports of the game that had already been released over the past four years. GamePro made the same criticisms, commenting that [...] "this former 16-bit puzzler isn't going anywhere new on the CD-i." ...|$|E

[...] He also appeared conciliatory: [...] "I wish the Americans had been there. [...] <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with vindication. [...] We just won the race, that's all." [...] Cadoux-Hudson said, [...] "I thought Cambridge would murder us but we took 20 colossal strokes {{and there was a}} primeval scream from the crew. There was a huge release." ...|$|E

500|$|In June 1994, the United Keetoowah Band {{had voted}} to stop {{awarding}} associate memberships. [...] Such honorary associate membership recognizes an individual's {{assistance to the}} tribe, but <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with Indian ancestry, {{and it does not}} entitle an individual to vote in the tribe as a member. The Keetoowah Band states that Churchill still holds the associate membership and it has not been rescinded. In a separate interview, Ernestine Berry, formerly on the tribe's enrollment committee and four years on its council, said that Churchill had never fulfilled a promise to help the tribe.|$|E
500|$|In May 2011, Gaga {{said her}} [...] "emotional connection" [...] {{with the song}} was difficult. When she was {{asked if it was}} because the song was {{originally}} written for Britney Spears, she answered: [...] "Well that’s not exactly what happened, but I don’t want to delve into that. I could delve into it if you turn that (motions to recorder) off... But ultimately the mix and the process of getting the production finished was very stressful for me. So when I say it’s my worst song <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with the song, just my emotional connection to it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Luxurious" [...] is an R ballad, whose {{instrumentation}} {{consists of}} keyboards and synthesizers. It {{is written in}} common time in the key of A minor. The song uses a descending i-vii-VI-V chord progression. The lyrics of the song include descriptions of wealth and riches, what one reviewer called [...] "a world of Egyptian cotton, cashmere, tuberoses, and, of course, diamonds". Stefani stated that [...] " [...] song really is more about a love relationship. If you really listen to the lyrics, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> {{to do with money}} or luxury. It has to do with love, being rich in love. I just wanted to think of a clever way to express how you have to work really hard for the rewards of that." [...] The single version of the song contains an additional verse from rapper Slim Thug for release to urban radio and clubs.|$|E

500|$|Some believe, Avraham Ben-Tzur {{being the}} most {{prominent}} writer on the subject, that the Ba'athist ideology preached in Syria after the coup should {{be referred to as}} neo-Ba'athism since <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with the ideology's classic form espoused by Aflaq, Bitar and the Aflaqites in general. Munif al-Razzaz agreed with the theory, stating that from 1961 onwards, there existed two Ba'ath parties – [...] "the military Ba'ath Party and the Ba'ath Party, and real power lay with the former." [...] He further noted that the military Ba'ath (as [...] "paraphrased by Martin Seymour") [...] "was and remains Ba'athist only in name; that it was and remains little more than a military clique with civilian hangers-on; and that from the initial founding of the Military Committee by disgruntled Syrian officers exiled in Cairo in 1959, the chain of events and the total corruption of Ba'athism proceeded with intolerable logic." [...] Bitar agreed, stating that the 1966 coup [...] "marked the end of Ba'athist politics in Syria." [...] Aflaq shared the sentiment, and stated; [...] "I no longer recognise my party!".|$|E
500|$|Regardless, Cyberpunk {{is still}} {{seen as having}} been an act of hyped commercialisation. In Escape Velocity: Cyberculture at the End of the Century, Mark Dery commented on the {{mainstreaming}} of the cyberpunk subculture. He viewed Idol as representing {{some of the worst}} abuses this took, deriding Cyberpunk as [...] "a bald-faced appropriation of every cyberpunk cliché that wasn't nailed down." [...] In 1995, when writer Jack Boulware asked [...] "When did cyberpunk die?" [...] at a meeting of former staff members of Mondo 2000, a response was [...] "1993. The release of the Billy Idol record." [...] In a section on [...] "cyberpunk music", The Cyberpunk Project website notes, [...] "... usual opinion is that Billy Idol's album is just commercialization and <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with cyberpunk." [...] The F.A.Q for alt.cyberpunk, mirrored on the website, rejects the notion that there is a [...] "cyberpunk fashion". Of Billy Idol's attempts to base his fashion and music on it, it states, [...] "No matter how sincere his intentions might have been, scorn and charges of commercialization have been heaped upon him in this and other forums." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band played}} the main {{stage at the}} 2008 Reading and Leeds Festivals in the UK, playing Leeds on Friday, August 22 and Reading on Sunday, August 24. In {{addition}} to this, the band provided support for Metallica at Marlay Park, Dublin in Ireland on August 20. They headlined {{the last night of}} the 2009 Outside Lands Festival in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco, on Sunday August 30, 2009. Music magazine Billboard quoted Black as revealing that [...] "We just laid down a hot [...] we're calling it the bomb track. It's a very powerful recording called [...] "Deth Starr" [...] so <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with the Star Wars ," [...] adding that [...] "It's kind of sci-fi, doomsday rock." [...] Jack Black also stated on the Late Show with David Letterman that he had an idea for a song called [...] "Rize of the Fenix", which he described as a [...] "rise from the ashes" [...] workout song similar to [...] "Eye of the Tiger". He performed a vocal sample of the song along to keyboards. Tenacious D played the main stage at Bonnaroo music festival in 2010, which featured the band playing the song [...] "Dio" [...] as a tribute to the late Ronnie James Dio.|$|E
5000|$|In January 2006, Crahalla {{announced}} her retirement, effective following the 2006 election, stating that her decision was to [...] "spend {{more time with}} family" [...] and that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with Stewart's accusations.|$|R

25|$|Reid's view on {{apartheid}} {{was that}} <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> {{to do with}} sport; nor should it affect it. Even in the late-1980s, when he lived and coached in South Africa, he remained opposed to the sports boycott.|$|R
500|$|The {{first half}} of Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt was {{recorded}} shortly {{after the completion of}} Blood Sugar Sex Magik; the second half between late 1991 and early 1992, during the album's tour. [...] "Running Away Into You" [...] is the only track recorded after he left the Chili Peppers. The album is a heavily experimental avant-garde composition whose initial purpose was spiritual and emotional expression: [...] "I wrote [...] because I was in a really big place in my head—it was a huge, spiritual place telling me what to do. As long as I'm obeying those forces, it's always going to be meaningful. I could be playing guitar and I could say 'Play something that sucks,' and if I'm in that place, it's gonna be great. And <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with me, except in ways that can't be understood." [...] Frusciante further asserted that the album was meant to be experienced as a cohesive unit rather than separate entities or songs. Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt was released on Rick Rubin's label American Recordings. Warner Bros., the Chili Peppers' label, owned rights to the album because of the leaving-artist clause in Frusciante's Chili Peppers contract. However, because he was reclusive, the label gladly handed the rights over to Rubin, who released the album at the urging of Frusciante's friends.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} promote the album and MTV Unplugged, Shakira {{embarked}} on the Tour Anfibio which began on 17 March 2000 in Panama City, Panama, and ended on 12 May 2000 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. It was sponsored by Nokia. The name [...] "anfibio" [...] was chosen by Shakira for its resemblance with her: earthy, viscerally connected to the water element, capable of adapting and willing to undergo metamorphosis. Shakira said about the tour's name: [...] "You'll have to find out. It's an invitation for you to watch the show and find out. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with past performances. You'll see an evolved and renewed Shakira. It's a spectacle of many transformations that will prevent the public from getting bored". The tour's setlist consisted of songs from her albums Pies Descalzos and Dónde Están los Ladrones? In addition, she included an a capella song, [...] "Alfonsina y el Mar", originally by Argentine folk singer Mercedes Sosa. Criticism of the tour included the high ticket prices, overselling of tickets in Guatemala, which according to the press could have caused a tragedy, the long delays {{at the start of}} the show and its short duration, and the accusation of the use of pre-recorded music in Puerto Rico. Despite the criticism, the tour was a financial success, earning Shakira a position in the list of Top 50 Tours published in the summer of 2000 by Pollstar magazine.|$|E
500|$|No {{artist was}} ever more true to his aim. Ideals resolutely pursued {{are apt to}} provoke the resentment of the world, and Burne-Jones encountered, endured and conquered an {{extraordinary}} amount of angry criticism. Insofar as this was directed against the lack of realism in his pictures, it was beside the point. The earth, the sky, the rocks, the trees, {{the men and women of}} Burne-Jones are not those of this world; but they are themselves a world, consistent with itself, and having therefore its own reality. Charged with the beauty and with the strangeness of dreams, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>nothing</b> of a dream's incoherence. Yet it is a dreamer always whose nature penetrates these works, a nature out of sympathy with struggle and strenuous action. Burne-Jones's men and women are dreamers too. It was this which, more than anything else, estranged him from the age into which he was born. But he had an inbred [...] "revolt from fact" [...] which would have estranged him from the actualities of any age. That criticism seems to be more justified which has found in him a lack of such victorious energy and mastery over his materials as would have enabled him to carry out his conceptions in their original intensity. Yet Burne-Jones was singularly strenuous in production. His industry was inexhaustible, and needed to be, if it was to keep pace with the constant pressure of his ideas. Whatever faults his paintings may have, they have always the fundamental virtue of design; they are always pictures. His designs were informed with a mind of romantic temper, apt in the discovery of beautiful subjects, and impassioned with a delight in pure and variegated colour.|$|E
