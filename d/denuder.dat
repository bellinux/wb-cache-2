40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{design and}} {{performance}} of a multiparallel plate <b>denuder</b> able to operate at low and high-flow (3 − 30 L/min) for the collection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) vapor is described. The <b>denuder,</b> in combination with a micro orifice uniform deposit impactor (MOUDI) {{was used to assess}} processes of artifact formation in MOUDIs used with and without an upstream <b>denuder.</b> Duplicate sampling trains with an upstream <b>denuder</b> showed good repeatability of the measured gas and particle-phase concentrations and low break-through in the <b>denuder</b> (3. 5 − 15 %). The PAH size distributions within undenuded and denuded MOUDIs were studied. Use of the <b>denuder</b> altered the measured size distribution of PAHs toward smaller sizes, but both denuded and undenuded systems are subject to sampling artifacts. 1...|$|E

40|$|Measurement of {{the loss}} of semi-volatile organic {{compounds}} from particles collected with a filter is carried out by comparing the amounts collected by comparable filter pack and diffusion <b>denuder</b> samplers. The sorbents used to collect organic compounds in the <b>denuder</b> and sorbent filters must have the same efficiency for collection of all gas-phase organic compounds present. Interpretation of the data requires that the efficiency of collection of gas-phase compounds by the <b>denuder</b> be known. In theory this can be accomplished by determination of the deposition pattern of all organic compounds collected in the <b>denuder,</b> but in practice this is very difficult if the organic material consists {{of a wide variety of}} compounds. An alternative approach is to determine the breakthrough of organic compounds in a sampler with a particle-collection filter preceding the <b>denuder</b> and sorbent filter. In such a sampler only ps-phase organic material enters the <b>denuder.</b> We have developed both a multi-channel parallel plate diffusion <b>denuder</b> sampler and a comparable sampler in which the <b>denuder</b> is preceded by a filter. Samples can be collected with the multi-system sampler at a flow rate of 35 sLpm. The <b>denuder</b> surfaces and the sorbent filters are made from sheets of an activated charcoal-impregnated filter paper. Collection of semi-volatile compounds by the samplers has been characterized and the systems have been field tested. The samplers are now being used for the routine collection and determination of semi-volatile organic compounds in particles at Canyonlands National Park in southeastern Utah.

40|$|The {{appearance}} of <b>denuded</b> zones following low stress creep in particle-containing crystalline materials {{is both a}} microstructural prediction and observation often cited as irrefutable evidence for the Nabarro-Herring (N-H) mechanism of diffusional creep. The <b>denuded</b> zones are predicted to be at grain boundaries that are orthogonal to {{the direction of the}} applied stress. Furthermore, their dimensions should account for the accumulated plastic flow. In the present article, the evidence for such <b>denuded</b> zones is critically examined. These zones have been observed during creep of magnesium, aluminum, and nickel-base alloys. The investigation casts serious doubts on the apparently compelling evidence for the link between <b>denuded</b> zones and diffusional creep. Specifically, <b>denuded</b> zones are clearly observed under conditions that are explicitly not diffusional creep. Additionally, the <b>denuded</b> zones are often found in directions that are not orthogonal to the applied stress. Other mechanisms that can account for the observations of <b>denuded</b> zones are discussed. It is proposed that grain boundary sliding accommodated by slip is the rate-controlling process in the stress range where <b>denuded</b> zones have been observed. It is likely that the <b>denuded</b> zones are created by dissolution of precipitates at grain boundaries that are simultaneously sliding and migrating during creep. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Considerable {{research}} {{has been focused on}} in vitro production (IVP) of goat embryos to improve its efficiency. In Experiment 1, the effect of the cumulus cells by comparing slaughterhouse-oocytes <b>denuded</b> on purpose (DOP) prior to IVF to intact COC, and the effect of heparin during IVF were assessed. In Experiment 2, oocytes that were already <b>denuded</b> at collection (DOC), DOP and intact COC were studied. Three treatments used oocytes <b>denuded</b> at collection: DOC oocytes were cultured alone for both IVM and IVF; DOC and COC were cultured together for both IVM and IVF or DOC were IVM alone and then mixed with COC for IVF. In other treatments, COC were allocated to four IVF treatments: Intact COC; COC were <b>denuded</b> prior to IVF; COC were <b>denuded</b> and IVF with added cumulus cells; COC were <b>denuded</b> and IVF mixed with intact COC giving two sub-treatments: <b>Denuded</b> oocytes that were IVF with COC; and COC that were IVF with <b>denuded</b> oocytes. After fertilization, all presumptive zygotes were cultured for 8 days. In Experiment 1, the yield of blastocysts as a proportion of total oocytes was greater (P< 0. 05) for COC that were IVF in the presence of heparin (54 %) than without heparin (42 %) or oocytes already <b>denuded</b> at collection that were IVF with or without heparin (41 %; 38 %; respectively). In Experiment 2, the developmental potential of oocytes <b>denuded</b> at collection was reduced (cleavage and blastocyst rates calculated from total oocytes: 34 %; 11 %, respectively) as compared to COC (77 %; 59 %, P< 0. 05). However, when equal numbers of both were mixed at the start of IVM, the rates were not significantly different to COC alone (68 %; 45 %), but when both were mixed equally only for IVF, the rates were reduced (57 %; 40 %, P< 0. 05). <b>Denuded</b> oocytes co-cultured with cumulus cells were not significantly different to intact COC (76 %; 55 %). The effect of adding COC during IVF to oocytes <b>denuded</b> after IVM was similar to adding cumulus cells to the same type of oocytes. In conclusion, both the use of heparin and the association of oocytes with cumulus cells, either detached or in intimate contact, during IVM and/or IVF significantly improve IVP of goat embryos. Furthermore, some oocytes that are already <b>denuded</b> at collection will develop satisfactorily to blastocysts when matured and fertilized with intact COC...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIntroductionBased {{on recent}} analyses, the {{measures}} of short-term responsiveness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) derived cartilage morphometry {{may not be as}} large as earlier studies had suggested. We examined if by selecting regions of interest with <b>denuded</b> cartilage, the remaining cartilage within this region of interest was susceptible to greater rates of cartilage loss. MethodsSubjects included for this analysis are a subset of the approximately 4700 participants in the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) Study. Bilateral radiographs and 3 T MRI (Siemens Trio) of the knees and clinical data are obtained at baseline and annually in all participants. Hundred and fifty subjects from the OAI progression subcohort all of whom had both frequent symptoms and, in the same knee, radiographic osteoarthritis (ROA defined as definite tibio-femoral osteophytes on X-ray) based on a screening reading done at the OAI clinics. One knee from each subject was selected for analysis. Using sagittal 3 D DESSwe MR images from the baseline and 12 -month follow-up visit, a segmentation algorithm was applied to the cartilage plates of the index knee to compute the cartilage volume, normalized cartilage volume (volume normalized to bone surface interface area), and percent <b>denuded</b> area (Total Cartilage Bone Interface area <b>denuded</b> of cartilage). Summary statistics of the changes (absolute and percentage) from baseline at 1 year and the standardized response mean (SRM), i. e., mean change divided by the standard deviation (SD) of that change were calculated. Analyses are stratified into three groups according to baseline assessment of <b>denuded</b> area: those with no <b>denuded</b> area in the region of interest at baseline, and then two groups (intermediate <b>denuded</b> area (≤median) and severe (≥median) <b>denuded</b> area) of equal sample size. ResultsOn average the subjects were 60. 9 years of age and obese with a mean body mass index (BMI) of 30. 3 kg/m 2. For the combined central medial femur and tibia the mean volume change for the whole sample was − 48. 2 (SD 159. 8) mm 3, which gives an SRM of − 0. 30. In the subsample of knees with no <b>denuded</b> area the SRM was − 0. 25, in the knees with intermediate <b>denuded</b> area the SRM was − 0. 30, and in knees with severe <b>denuded</b> area the SRM was − 1. 00. For normalized volume of the central medial femur in the subsample of knees with no <b>denuded</b> area the SRM was − 0. 22, in the knees with intermediate <b>denuded</b> area the SRM was − 0. 26, and in knees with severe <b>denuded</b> area (n= 23) the SRM was − 0. 71. The magnitude of the SRMs was generally smaller in participants with no <b>denuded</b> area. In contrast, the SRMs in participants with <b>denuded</b> area were larger. ConclusionBy selecting participants with the presence of cartilage regions with <b>denuded</b> area the ability to demonstrate change in cartilage loss in that specific location is markedly improved compared to persons without a full thickness lesion in that cartilage plate. This option for screening during recruitment in clinical trials could facilitate the detection of participants at greater risk of subsequent cartilage loss...|$|R

Abstract—Laboratory models of the {{respiratory}} lining with mucin secreting epithelial goblet cells have been obtained by culturing epithelial cells under air–liquid interface (ALI) conditions, which require specific wells with semi-permeable substrates. In this study nasal epithelial cells (NEC) were successfully cultured on <b>denuded</b> amniotic membrane (AM) under ALI conditions. The cells adhered well {{on both sides of}} the <b>denuded</b> AM (i. e., the basement membrane or spongy layer) and proliferated to confluency at the same time as cells grown on a synthetic membrane. The cytoskeleton structure of cells grown on <b>denuded</b> AMs appeared to be denser and firmer than that of cells cultured on synthetic membranes. Cultures on the <b>denuded</b> AM differentiated to contain goblet cells which produce and secrete mucins and ciliated cells. Cells cultured on the <b>denuded</b> AM were more stable under airflow conditions than cells on the synthetic membranes. The results of this study suggest that NEC culture on <b>denuded</b> AM and under ALI conditions creates a stable and well-differentiated in vitro model of the nasal lining for laboratory studies.

40|$|Background: We have {{previously}} developed a limbal epithelial culture system using a cell-suspension method on <b>denuded</b> amniotic membrane (AM). However, other workers reported that intact AM is advantageous for limbal epithelial culture {{in that it}} preserves stem cell characteristics. In this study, we cultivated human limbal epithelial cell-suspensions on both intact and <b>denuded</b> AM and compared the morphology and adhesion of the limbal epithelial cells on these two substrates. Methods: Human limbal epithelial cells were dissociated from donor eyes using dispase and gentle pipetting and then seeded onto intact and <b>denuded</b> AM as cell suspension. Limbal epithelial cells on AM were co-cultured with a MMC-treated 3 T 3 fibroblast feeder layer and epithelial differentiation was promoted by air lifting. Cultures were examined by light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy and differences in cellular attachments and intercellular spacing were quantified. Basement membrane complexes were examined by indirect immunofluorescence. Results: Limbal cells grown on <b>denuded</b> AM were well stratified and differentiated. Cells were well attached {{to each other and}} to the basement membrane. In contrast, limbal cells cultured on intact AM failed to stratify and in places formed a monolayer. The culture on <b>denuded</b> AM had significantly (P < 0. 001) more desmosomal junctions as well as significantly (P < 0. 001) more junctional attachments to the carrier than the intact culture. In addition, the intercellular spaces between cells cultivated on <b>denuded</b> AM were significantly (P < 0. 001) smaller than those between cells grown on the intact substrate. In cultures on both <b>denuded</b> and intact AM, the basement membrane zone displayed a positive staining for collagen VII, integrins alpha- 6 and beta- 4 and laminin 5. Conclusions: We successfully cultivated well-stratified and -differentiated limbal cells on <b>denuded</b> AM, while on the intact AM limbal cells failed to stratify and in places formed only a monolayer of cells. The limbal cells cultivated on <b>denuded</b> AM were well attached to the AM stroma and were morphologically superior to the limbal epithelium cultivated on intact AM. We conclude that for purposes of transplantation of differentiated epithelial sheets, <b>denuded</b> AM is probably the more practical carrier for human limbal epithelial cell cultures when using our cell-suspension culture system...|$|R

40|$|The Henry {{coefficient}} of NO_ 3 radicals, K_h(NO_ 3), was studied in coiled <b>denuder</b> tubes of 2 mm diameter and variable length, e. g. 4 - 350 cm. The radicals were produced in a flow system by oxidation of NO with excess O_ 3 at {{a temperature of}} 393 K. A small flow of pure H_ 2 O was metered to the gas-flow and allowed to form a thin film on the <b>denuder</b> wall. Behind the <b>denuder,</b> gas and liquid were separated and the concentration of the dissolved NO_ 3 was determined indirectly, after conversion to nitrate by reaction with Cl" [...] ions, which {{were added to the}} effluent of the <b>denuder.</b> The partial pressure of NO_ 3 in the gas-phase behind the <b>denuder</b> was determined by quantitative conversion to nitrate in another <b>denuder.</b> The same experimental set-up was used to determine the mass accommodation {{coefficient of}} NO_ 3 to an aqueous surface. There, a high Cl" [...] concentration (0. 1 M) was used in the stripping solution to efficiently convert the dissolved NO_ 3 to NO anti 3 and thus prevent phase-equilibrium to be reached. The mass accommodation coefficient was derived from the transmittance of the <b>denuder</b> as a function of length. The method requires the knowledge of the diffusion coefficient, which was determined in separate experiments conducted under the same conditions with HNO_ 3. The mass accommodation coefficient of NO_ 3 was found to be #>=# 2. 5. 10 "-" 3. Theoretical considerations and time-dependent box-model calculations show that even under favourable conditions, heterogeneous losses of NO_ 3 are important for the budget of NO_x only, if NO_x-concentrations are below 0. 5 ppb. At higher NO_x-concentrations, the night-time losses proceed predominantly via N_ 2 O_ 5. In the maritime boundary layer, night-time losses of NO_ 3 radicals can compete with NO_x caused by OH radicals during day-time. (orig. /KW) Dissertation submitted by K.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{comparison of}} two inherently different ambient air samplers {{has been conducted}} to fully characterize and compare their performance in sampling and measuring the partitioning of a suite of 29 semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs). A high volume air sampler (hi-vol) utilizing polyurethane foam (PUF) adsorbent for vapor-phase trapping and an annular diffusion <b>denuder</b> sampler were operated concurrently. Sampling artifacts were observed and {{can be related to}} the physicochemical properties of the analytes and the designs of the samplers. The results suggest that high volume air samplers equipped with PUF are unsuitable for measuring those organochlorine compounds and 2 - and 3 -ring PAHs which have subcooled liquid vapor pressures (p°L) greater than ca. 0. 2 Pa (log[p°L] = − 0. 7), owing to their breakthrough on PUF sampling media at relatively low sample volumes (170 m 3) and ambient temperatures typical of temperate regions (mean = 11 °C, max = 18 °C). Theoretical calculations of breakthrough volumes for SVOCs on PUF are presented and in most cases these successfully predict observed behavior. The <b>denuder</b> sampler is more efficient at measuring the relatively volatile SVOCs. For total SVOC measurements the hi-vol and <b>denuder</b> were in good agreement for those compounds which were efficiently sampled, and the <b>denuder</b> yielded total SVOC concentrations which differed by a mean factor of 1. 2 relative to those obtained with the hi-vol sampler. The hi-vol sampler provides good agreement with the Junge-Pankow model for partitioning of the relatively less volatile PAHs (log[p°L] − 3), particulate loadings are overestimated with respect to the Junge-Pankow model, and for less volatile SVOCs, particulate loadings tend to be underestimated. An important observation is that the results from the <b>denuder</b> indicate that PCBs may be adsorbed on atmospheric particulate matter to a similar degree as PAHs...|$|E
40|$|A {{particle}} trap impactor/denuder {{system has}} been developed and tested for the sampling of ambient carbonaceous aerosols. Use of a particle trap impactor allows for a reduction of particle bounce and re-entrainment at high particle loadings, and operation at high volumetric flow rates is achieved {{without the use of}} oiled impaction substrates, thus facilitating the chemical and physical analysis of the organic compounds comprising the collected gas (G) and particle (P) phases. Honeycomb denuders have a greater density of channels for a given <b>denuder</b> cross-sectional area than parallel plate or annular denuders; for a given sampling flow rate, honeycomb denuders can be fabricated in more compact shapes and will have a greater amount of surface area for the collection of gases. Field testing of the sampler was conducted primarily at night to minimize the evaporation of organic carbon (OC) from collected particles, which can result from the heating of collected particles as ambient temperatures rise during the day. In side-by-side testing with an open-face filter pack sampler, the <b>denuder</b> system was found to minimize positive gas adsorption artifacts caused by the adsorption of gaseous OC to quartz filter fiber (QFF) surfaces. In the <b>denuder</b> sampler, negligible amounts of OC were observed on a QFF placed downstream of a particle-loaded QFF, suggesting that OC detected on the backup QFF in the filter pack sampler resulted primarily from the adsorption of ambient G-phase OC rather than OC evaporated from particles collected on the front filter. Equations are presented for the evaluation of the magnitude of positive and negative sampling artifacts. Analysis of these equations indicates that the mass of OC evaporated from filter-bound particles present downstream of a <b>denuder</b> depends on (i) the volume of OC-free gas passed through the filter, (ii) the P-phase concentration and the P/G partition coefficients (K_p) of the compounds comprising the P-phase OC, (iii) the temperature (T) (values of K_p are inversely proportional to T), and (iv) the mass fraction of carbon in the compounds comprising P-phase OC. For these reasons, the magnitude of evaporative losses of OC in <b>denuder</b> samplers may vary among different sampling events. In addition, a method utilizing gas chromatography/mass spectrometry has been developed for determination of inertial impactor collection efficiency and <b>denuder</b> particle transmission efficiency. Using this method, only a single extraction of the sampler components is necessary, thereby reducing the number of extractions and analyses over conventional approaches by at least a factor of 2...|$|E

40|$|Measurement of ambient {{particulate}} {{organic carbon}} (POC) with quartz filters is prone to positive and negative sampling artifacts. One approach for estimating these artifacts is to sample with a backup quartz filter placed behind either the main quartz filter or a Teflon filter in a parallel line. Another approach {{is to use a}} <b>denuder</b> to reduce the positive artifact in combination with a highly adsorbent backup filter to capture any negative artifact. Results obtained using both of these approaches in parallel for over one year in Pittsburgh, PA are presented in this article. A sampler using an activated carbon monolith <b>denuder</b> has been developed and tested extensively. Transmission losses were found to be negligible, and the <b>denuder</b> is on average 94 % efficient at removing gas-phase organics. <b>Denuder</b> breakthrough is corrected for each run using a dynamic blank in parallel with the sample line. Comparisons with the dynamic blank indicate that the <b>denuder</b> almost eliminates the positive artifact on the quartz filter. Negative artifact from the denuded quartz filter is quantified using a carbon-impregnated glass fiber (CIG) backup filter and was found to be small, typically less than 10 % of the ambient POC. Compared to the denuded sampler POC, 24 h bare quartz samples showed an almost constant positive artifact of 0. 5 μg-C/m 3 for samples taken throughout the year-long study period. Sampling for shorter durations (4 - 6 h) resulted in a larger positive artifact. A quartz filter behind a Teflon filter (QBT) provides a consistent estimate of the positive artifact on the bare quartz filter irrespective of sample duration, though it overcorrects for the positive artifact by 16 - 20 % (attributed to particulate matter volatilizing off the upstream Teflon filter). The quartz behind quartz (QBQ) approach provides a reasonable estimate of the positive artifact on the bare quartz filter for the 24 h samples but not for the shorter samples. A slight seasonal variation is observed in the absolute value of the positive artifact, with higher values observed during the summer months...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to design and evaluate an experimental setup {{to be used for}} field studies of particle formation in biomass gasification processes. The setup includes a high-temperature dilution probe and a <b>denuder</b> to separate solid particles from condensable volatile material. The efficiency of the setup to remove volatile material from the sampled stream and the influence from condensation on particles with different morphologies is presented. In order to study the sampling setup model, aerosols were created with a nebulizer to produce compact and solid KCl particles and a diffusion flame burner to produce agglomerated and irregular soot particles. The nebulizer and soot generator was followed by an evaporation–condensation section where volatile material, dioctylsebacete (DOS), was added to the system as a tar model compound. The model aerosol particles were heated to 200 °C to create a system containing both solid particles and volatile organic material in gas phase. The heated aerosol particles were sampled and diluted at the same temperature with the dilution probe. Downstream the probe, the DOS was adsorbed in the <b>denuder.</b> This was achieved by slowly decreasing the temperature of the diluted sample towards ambient level in the <b>denuder.</b> Thereby the supersaturation of organic vapors was reduced which decreased the probability for tar condensation and nucleation of new particles. Both the generation system and the sampling technique gave reproducible results. A DOS collection efficiency of > 99 % was achieved if the <b>denuder</b> inlet concentration was diluted to less than 1 – 6 mg/m 3 depending on the <b>denuder</b> flow rate. Concentrations higher than that lead to significant impact on the resulting KCl size distribution. The choice of model compounds was done to study the effect from the particle morphology on the achieved particle characteristics after the sampling setup.

The calculated particle transmission efficiency through the <b>denuder</b> was found to be essentially 100 % for particles > 50 nm, whilst the experimental overall efficiency, as determined by CPC and SMPS measurements, was 92 ± 4 %. The size resolved transmission efficiency was < 60 % for particles below 20 nm and 100 % for particles larger than 200 nm. Losses could have been due to diffusion and electrostatic effects. Semi-volatile gaseous analytes are pre-concentrated in the silicone of the trap and may be thermally desorbed using a commercially available desorber, allowing for total transfer and detection of the collected analytes by GC 36 MS. This enhances detection limits and allows for lower sampling flow rates and shorter sampling times, which are advantageous for studies requiring high temporal resolution. The CSIR, NLC and NRF.

40|$|The first direct {{microstructural}} observation used {{as evidence}} for diffusional creep {{is from the}} work of Squires, Weiner, and Phillips (S-W-P). They observed <b>denuded</b> zones at grain boundaries after creep in a Mg- 0. 5 wt. % Zr alloy that contained inert precipitates. It is {{the purpose of this paper}} to show that the reported creep data for the Mg- 0. 5 wt. %Zr alloy was, in fact, obtained in a region where dislocation creep, rather than diffusional creep, was the dominant deformation mechanism. Details of the <b>denuded</b> zone formation will also be presented which question the relation of <b>denuded</b> zones to diffusional creep. Therefore, it is contended that the microstructurally-observed <b>denuded</b> zones cannot be a result of diffusional creep. This contention supports previously-published views by the present authors that conclusive proof for diffusional creep in polycrystalline materials remains elusive. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Eleven {{instruments}} for {{the measurement of}} am-bient concentrations of atmospheric ammonia gas (NH 3), based on eight different measurement methods were inter-compared above an intensively managed agricultural field in late summer 2008 in Southern Scotland. To test the in-struments {{over a wide range}} of concentrations, the field was fertilised with urea midway through the experiment, lead-ing to an increase in the average concentration from 10 to 100 ppbv. The instruments deployed included three wet-chemistry systems, one with offline analysis (annular rotat-ing batch <b>denuder,</b> RBD) and two with online-analysis (An-nular <b>Denuder</b> sampling with online Analysis, AMANDA; AiRRmonia), two Quantum Cascade Laser Absorption Spec-trometers (a large-cell dual system; DUAL-QCLAS, and a compact system; c-QCLAS), two photo-acoustic spectrome...|$|E
30|$|<b>Denuder</b> or dry {{sampling}} methods, {{such as the}} ISO-CHECK® three stage filter system, as well as {{passive sampling}} methods where the isocyanates are absorbed onto a filter without using any pumps or other assistance, {{have been developed for}} personal sampling and/or prolonged sampling times (Marand et al. 2005; Gylestam et al. 2014; Henneken et al. 2006; Henneken et al. 2003; von Zweigbergk et al. 2002; Nordqvist et al. 2005). Furthermore, these solvent-free, filter-based methods do not need any field preparation or fragile glassware, such as an impinger (Gylestam et al. 2014). The stability of the collected isocyanates by a <b>denuder</b> system have also been described as superior to the impinger-filter method (Gylestam et al. 2014). However, due to the limited amount of derivatisation agent {{that can be used to}} impregnate the filters used for solvent-free sampling of isocyanates, such as <b>denuder</b> systems, the amount of isocyanates that can be sampled is lower than when sampling by the impinger-filter method (Gylestam et al. 2014). Moreover, there is also a greater chance of carryover when larger quantities of analytes are present. These methods are therefore not suitable for quantitative purposes (Henneken et al. 2006).|$|E
40|$|Aerosol thermodenuders {{provide a}} measure of {{particle}} volatility. The information provided by a thermodenuder is fundamentally related to the kinetics of evaporation and condensation within the device. Here, a time-dependent, multi-component model of particle and gas-phase mass transfer in a thermodenuder is described. This model empirically accounts for the temperature profile {{along the length of}} a typical thermodenuder and distinguishes between the influence of the heating section and of the adsorbent <b>denuder</b> section. It is shown that "semi-volatile" aerosol is particularly sensitive to the inclusion of an adsorbent <b>denuder</b> in the model. As expected, the mass loss from evaporation of particles as they pass through the thermodenuder {{is directly related to the}} compound vapor pressure, although the assumptions regarding the enthalpy of vaporization are shown to also have a large influence on the overall calculated mass thermograms. The model has been validated by comparison with previously measured mass thermograms for single-component aerosols and is shown to provide reasonable semi-quantitative agreement. The model that has been developed here can be used to provide quantitative understanding of aerosol volatility measurements of single and multi-component aerosol made using thermodenuders that include adsorbent <b>denuder</b> sections...|$|E

40|$|Vascular myocytes and endothelial cells {{possess the}} enzymatic {{machinery}} to generate nitric oxide from L-arginine. This study tests {{the hypothesis that}} myocyte-derived nitric oxide has an autocrine function to inhibit contraction. Rat aortic rings were placed in muscle baths for isometric force measurement. <b>Denuded</b> and intact rings contracted to N[omega]nitro-L-arginine; L-arginine reversed these contractions. Compared to intact rings, contractile sensitivity to phenylephrine was increased in <b>denuded</b> rings; N[omega]nitro-L-arginine caused a further enhancement of phenylephrine sensitivity. Acetylcholine contracted <b>denuded</b> rings but not intact rings; these contractions were also potentiated by N[omega]nitro-L-arginine. In intact rings contracted with phenylephrine, acetylcholine caused relaxation that was inhibited by N[omega]nitro-L-arginine. <b>Denuded</b> rings did not relax to acetylcholine. In summary, contractile responses of rat aortae to interventions that alter nitric oxide production are the composite of enzymatic activity in both the endothelial cells and myocytes. Thus, myocyte-derived nitric oxide modulates vascular tone...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of <b>denuded</b> zones at grain boundaries, normal to the tensile stress, during de{{formation of}} magnesium-zirconium hydride materials, {{has been cited}} as direct evidence for the occurrence of Nabarro-Herring (N-H) diffusional creep. Recently, the present authors refuted this evidence and instead concluded that the deformation process in these materials was one of diffusion-controlled dislocation creep. It was further postulated that the experimentally-observed <b>denuded</b> zones developed {{as a result of}} tensile-stress-directed grain boundary migration during creep; a process which dissolves hydride precipitates as the boundary moves. The evidence and conclusions regarding <b>denuded</b> zones given in reference [4]have been challenged by Burton and Reynolds [5], by Greenwood [6], by Bilde-Sorensen and Smith [7], and by Langdon [8]. A response to Burton and Reynolds and to Greenwood has been given by Ruano et al [9]. In that paper, additional evidence was presented supporting our view that diffusional-controlled dislocation creep or grain boundary sliding accommodated by slip (GBS), rather than diffusional creep, was considered to be the dominant deformation process. Bilde-Sorensen and Smith [7]agreed with our conclusion that <b>denuded</b> zones may occur from mechanisms other than diffusional creep, but disagreed with our statement that in “the diffusional creep model <b>denuded</b> zones of equal size are required on both sides of transverse boundaries. ” They point out that not all grain boundaries in tension are good sources of vacancy generation and that such boundaries would not be expected to show <b>denuded</b> zones.
