5000|$|The Terceira Rift is 550 km long, and {{represents}} the world’s slowest spreading center, with plate divergence of 2-4 mm/year. It developed from a transform fault and now {{operates as a}} hyper-slow spreading center, as recognized by the relative movement between the African and Eurasian plates. [...] There is a strong resemblance between the Terceira Rift and other ultra- or super- slow spreading ridges, such as the Gakkel Rift and the Southwest Indian ridges. In particular, high obliquity values of 40°-65°, and a magmatic segmentation wavelength of 100 km, are similar to other very slow rifts. [...] Rift valleys present along the rift are 1000-2200 m deep, and 30-60 km wide, similar to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge median valley. However, the amplitude of the Terceira Rift along-strike topography is 2000-4000 m, which is much larger than expected for ultraslow spreading ridges. [...] This irregularity {{is thought to be}} due to the association of the rift with the Azores hotspot, in combination with slow spreading rates. Slow spreading results in a strong and thick axial elastic plate, and slower volcanic extrusions from the rift zone, resulting in high topography when merged with plume-related volcanism. [...] The large volume of volcanism associated with the hotspot is mainly controlled by regional extension between Africa and Eurasia, as indicated by strikes of extension fractures.

The flow structure and bed <b>deformation</b> <b>patterns</b> in channel bends with different flow conditions were analyzed. Modeled results demonstrated that the velocity distribution and bed deformation in the meandering channel depend mostly on the flow regimes. For the case of small flow discharge, the maximum velocity occurs {{in the vicinity of}} concave bank.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of deformation patterns during thrust-related folding is {{of importance for}} both industrial and academic purposes because of the control that it exerts on the migration and accumulation of fluids in reservoirs. The link between structural position and <b>deformation</b> <b>pattern</b> has been described in both theoretical and field works. On the other hand, the well-documented dependence of deformation structures on the mechanical rock properties and on the environmental conditions indicates that, during folding, structural, stratigraphic, and environmental variables interact to control the <b>deformation</b> <b>pattern</b> within folds. In this work we describe the <b>deformation</b> <b>pattern</b> of the Mt.

40|$|The crustal {{deformation}} patterns {{associated with}} the earthquake cycle can depend strongly on the rheological properties of subcrustal material. Substantial deviations from the simple patterns for a uniformly elastic earth are expected when viscoelastic flow of subcrustal material is considered. The {{detailed description of the}} <b>deformation</b> <b>pattern</b> and in particular the surface displacements, displacement rates, strains, and strain rates depend on the structure and geometry of the material near the seismogenic zone. The origin of some of these differences are resolved by analyzing several different linear viscoelastic models with a common finite element computational technique. The models involve strike-slip faulting and include a thin channel asthenosphere model, a model with a varying thickness lithosphere, and a model with a viscoelastic inclusion below the brittle slip plane. The calculations reveal that the surface <b>deformation</b> <b>pattern</b> is most sensitive to the rheology of the material that lies below the slip plane in a volume whose extent is a few times the fault depth. If this material is viscoelastic, the surface <b>deformation</b> <b>pattern</b> resembles that of an elastic layer lying over a viscoelastic half-space. When the thickness or breath of the viscoelastic material is less than a few times the fault depth, then the surface <b>deformation</b> <b>pattern</b> is altered and geodetic measurements are potentially useful for studying the details of subsurface geometry and structure. Distinguishing among the various models is best accomplished by making geodetic measurements not only near the fault but out to distances equal to several times the fault depth. This is where the model differences are greatest; these differences will be most readily detected shortly after an earthquake when viscoelastic effects are most pronounced...|$|E

40|$|Short {{coupling}} beams in wall structures work predominantly {{in shear}} and develop complex <b>deformation</b> <b>patterns.</b> For this reason they cannot be modelled {{based on the}} classical plane-sections-remain-plane hypothesis, and are typically designed with strut-and-tie models. However, because strut-and-tie models are inherently conservative, they can result in very large amounts of shear reinforcement (stirrups), and therefore significant construction difficulties. In addition, strut-and-tie models do not provide information about the deformation capacity of coupling beams, which is important for performance-based seismic design. To address these challenges, this paper discusses a three-parameter kinematic theory (3 PKT) for the shear strength and <b>deformation</b> <b>patterns</b> of short coupling beams. The 3 PKT approach is situated between simple and conservative strut-and-tie models and complex non-linear finite element (FE) models. While FE models use {{a large number of}} degrees of freedom (DOFs) to describe the <b>deformation</b> <b>patterns</b> in coupling beams, the 3 PKT method is based on a kinematic model with only three DOFs.

In these structures {{it is possible to}} study the fracture network attributes and understand their relationships to the folding process, thus gathering fundamental information for fracture modelling in reservoirs. In this work we analyse the mesoscopic <b>deformation</b> <b>pattern</b> of the NW–SE-trending Bangestan anticline (SW Zagros, Iran) and discuss its relationship to the kinematic evolution of the hosting structure. The <b>deformation</b> <b>pattern</b> mostly includes extensional structures and pressure solution cleavages striking parallel to the fold axial trend (i. e. longitudinal), transversal extensional structures, and N–S- and E–W-striking extensional structures (oriented oblique to the fold axis). With the aid of deep wells and a transversal reflection seismic profile, we constructed a balanced cross-section of the anticline and propose a kinematic evolution pathway constrained by the mesoscopic <b>deformation</b> <b>pattern.</b> Longitudinal and transversal deformation structures developed before and/or in the very early stages of fold growth.

The <b>deformation</b> <b>pattern</b> is explained by dislocation models incorporating horizontal detachment fault with steady slip in the upper crust. However, deformation data alone cannot determine the model and there exist different possibilities.
