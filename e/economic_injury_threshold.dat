30|$|It {{is worthy}} {{to note that}} most {{scholars}} study the single state feedback control on impulsive differential equation, that is, they consider only the case when the density of population reaches a given threshold. We can take preventive measures, but this method is {{not consistent with the}} facts. To avoid the economic and practical issues, it is required to adopt different controlling methods under different thresholds. It can be considered under three cases. Firstly, when the density of pest population x(t) reaches the slightly harmful threshold h_ 1, releasing the natural enemy population y(t) may help avoid the damage. Secondly, when the density of pest population x(t) is at the economic threshold h_ 2 (0 < h_ 1 < h_ 2), only releasing the natural enemy cannot reduce the damage. Therefore, certain pesticide has to be sprayed and the natural enemy released at the same time. Finally, if control measures are taken at the <b>economic</b> <b>injury</b> <b>threshold</b> h_ 3 (h_ 3 >h_ 2), high intensity pesticide will kill a large number of natural enemies, pollute the environment and cause serious economic losses. It can be seen that the pest controlling method of multi state pulse has important research value in practical application [38, 39].|$|E
40|$|Based on {{previous}} complaints and reports from farmers to researchers about potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) problems in South-Kivu Province, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (RDCongo), {{there was a}} need to understand farmers′ knowledge of existing insect pest problems and current management practice challenges. Such information is important for designing a suitable intervention and successful integrated pest management (IPM) strategy for the Province. Hence, using a semi-structured questionnaire, a farm household survey was conducted among 300 potato farmers in six sites belonging to 2 territories (Kabare, Kalehe) of South- Kivu Province from June to August 2015. Insect pests, diseases and price fluctuations were among the highest ranked constraints in potato production by farmers. Cutworms (Agrotis spp.), aphids (Myzus persicae Sulzer), and potato tuber moth (Phthorimaea operculella Zeller) were the most severe insect pests in medium altitude zones (1600 - 1950 m). Ants (Dorylis orantalis Westwood), whiteflies (Bemisia tabaci Gennadius), and leafminer flies (Liriomyza huidobrensis Blanchard) were the pests of high importance reported from sites of very high altitude (2000 - 2600 m). Major yield losses were mostly attributed to late blight (Phytophthora infestans Mont. de Bary) and or insect pests and reached 65 - 90 % without chemical control in most study sites. On average, farmers had little knowledge about pest characteristics (bio-ecology, behavior,…). Most (71. 5 %) farmers were not able to correctly identify insect pest species names. Sometimes, two or more species had the same local name. There was a great confusion between damages (attacks) due to pests, diseases and environmental stresses (rains, soil nutrient deficiency) among farmers. Very few (18. 5 %) farmers interviewed knew with precision some insect pests. Most (80 %) farmers did not know what natural enemies of insect pests and IPM were. Seasonal pest outbreak and emerging new pests were phenomenon related to previous long lasting and repetitive civil wars (1995 - 2016). Farmers (62. 8 %) perceived that invasion and emergence of new potato pests could be linked to the smoke of bullets, to climate variability and to uncontrolled introduction of new planting materials. There was a confusion between emergency and resurgence of classical pests. In some cases, there was resurgence of classical pests due to resistance to some pesticides. Resistance to pesticide was mainly because farmers were heavily applying pesticides prior to receiving advice from extension workers about wise and safer application of pesticides. The level of severity of potato pest incidence was perceived by farmers as extremely high (68. 2 %) as compared to the situation 20 years (1995 - 2016) ago. Current farmers′ main response to controlling pests in potato is to apply hazardous, high toxic insecticides that pollute the environment. The predominant control methods were use of fungicides combined (35. 7 %) or not (64. 4 %) to insecticides. Potato production in eastern DRCongo is a pesticide dependent crop, according to farmers. This lack of knowledge about environmentally friendly control methods of pests, called for training of both farmers and extension workers in insect pest identification, collection, biology, behavior, ecology, monitoring and control approaches. Empowering farmers with knowledge about insect pests is essential for the reduction of pesticide misuse and uptake of more environmentally friendly approaches like IPM and related strategies (climate smart and Bt-varieties). Field surveys would need follow-up in order to assess the actual field infestation rates and intensities of each insect pest (determine <b>economic</b> <b>injury</b> <b>threshold</b> per species) and develop warning/alerting methods when there are outbreaks in the potato growing zones of eastern DRCongo. There was a call for breeders to develop new varieties that are biotic- abiotic tolerant and which respond to socioeconomic desire of producers and consumers...|$|E

5000|$|IPM is the {{selection}} and use of pest control actions that will ensure favourable economic, ecological and social consequences and is applicable to most agricultural, public health and amenity pest management situations. The IPM process starts with monitoring, which includes inspection and identification, followed by the establishment of <b>economic</b> <b>injury</b> levels. The <b>economic</b> <b>injury</b> levels set the economic threshold level. That is the point when pest damage (and the benefits of treating the pest) exceed the cost of treatment. [...] This can also be an action threshold level for determining an unacceptable level that is not tied to <b>economic</b> <b>injury.</b> Action <b>thresholds</b> are more common in structural pest management and <b>economic</b> <b>injury</b> levels in classic agricultural pest management. An example of an action threshold is one fly in a hospital operating room is not acceptable, but one fly in a pet kennel would be acceptable. Once a threshold has been crossed by the pest population action steps {{need to be taken}} to reduce and control the pest. Integrated pest management employ a variety of actions including cultural controls, including physical barriers, biological controls, including adding and conserving natural predators and enemies to the pest, and finally chemical controls or pesticides. Reliance on knowledge, experience, observation and integration of multiple techniques makes IPM appropriate for organic farming (excluding synthetic pesticides). These may or may not include materials listed on the Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI) Although the pesticides and particularly insecticides used in organic farming and organic gardening are generally safer than synthetic pesticides, they are not always more safe or environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides and can cause harm. For conventional farms IPM can reduce human and environmental exposure to hazardous chemicals, and potentially lower overall costs.|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were to evaluate the impact of soybean aphid (Aphis glycines Matsumura) feeding on the yield response of V 1, V 3, and R 1 KS 4202 soybean plants and {{examine the effect of}} soybean aphid feeding on peroxidase activity in V 1 and V 3 KS 4202 plants. KS 4202 plants infested during the early vegetative stages (VC, VE and V 1) were identified as highly susceptible based upon plant damage and stunting of the plants. In contrast, V 3, V 4, and V 5 stage KS 4202 soybeans were classified as moderately resistant. In the yield response study, V 1, V 3 and R 1 plants had aphid numbers that exceeded the average <b>economic</b> <b>injury</b> level <b>threshold</b> of 674 aphids per plant. Despite exceeding this level, V 3 and R 1 aphid-infested plants were not statistically different from their respective control plants for any of the yield parameters evaluated except average pod weight, which was statistically higher for plants exposed to the high aphid treatment than to the control treatment. Changes in protein content, peroxidase activity and isozyme profiles in response to aphid feeding were documented in V 1 and V 3 stages of tolerant (KS 4202) and susceptible (SD 76 R) soybeans at 6, 16, and 22 days after aphid introduction. Protein content was similar between infested and control V 1 and V 3 stage plants for both KS 4202 and SD 76 R at 6, 16, and 22 days after aphid introduction. Enzyme kinetics studies documented that KS 4202 V 1 and SD 76 R V 1 and V 3 control and aphid-infested soybean had similar levels of peroxidase activity at the three time points evaluated. By contrast, KS 4202 aphid-infested plants at the V 3 stage had significantly higher peroxidase activity levels than control plants at 6 and 22 days after aphid introduction. The differences in peroxidase activity observed between infested and control V 3 KS 4202 plants throughout the course of the experiment suggest that peroxidases may be playing multiple roles in the tolerant plant. Gels stained for peroxidases identified differences in the isozyme profiles of aphid-infested and control plants for both KS 4202 and SD 76 R. The results of this research provide insights to better understand the tolerance response in KS 4202 and ultimately will result in improved management options for this important insect pest.

Since the first European Committee directive for pedestrian safety was published, vehicle suppliers have implemented pedestrian protection requirements to automobile structures at the design level. As to the development of current automobile front-end structures, a question arises about pedestrian safety: are there existing injury criteria for the new generation of cars? Most previous <b>injury</b> <b>thresholds</b> for knee ligaments were principally based on isolated sub-segment tests with contrived loading conditions, and rarely took the entire front-end shape of the car model into account to simulate realistic pedestrian loading conditions. Hence, the current study aims to investigate <b>injury</b> <b>thresholds</b> of primary knee ligament injuries in car–pedestrian impact environments as well as to evaluate the previous criteria proposed by isolated sub-segment tests. The entire front-end shape of a car model was employed. A parametric study of various pedestrian loading conditions was implemented by finite element simulations regarding three influencing factors: impact heights, locations of impact and impact velocities. Finally, the <b>injury</b> <b>thresholds</b> associated with primary knee ligament injuries of pedestrians were defined with the dominant injury mechanisms: combined lateral bending and shearing effects. These thresholds are also well correlated with the previous criteria defined by isolated lower limb tests...|$|R

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the spatial distribution of insect populations in crops allows the estimation of the population density in space, the classification of damage impact on yield as well as decisions to be made about control measures. To evaluate the spatial distribution of the wheat armyworm Pseudaletia sequax Franclemont, {{in relation to the}} development and yield of triticale (Triticum secale Wittmack) under no-till management, samplings were taken at 302 points in a square grid measuring 10 x 10 m, in Campinas, SP, Brazil.

Grain yield (kg ha- 1), cover of the above-ground part (kg ha- 1), mean plant height (m), and ground cover percentage were evaluated after the triticale crop was mechanically harvested, with the measurement of the mass of straw left on soil surface. Geostatistics was used to analyze spatial variability, by means of semivariogram analysis, and interpolation of data by both ordinary and indicator kriging, considering the <b>injury</b> <b>threshold</b> level of ten caterpillars per square meter to construct isoline maps.

40|$|Clinicians {{are charged}} with the {{significant}} task of distinguishing between accidental and inflicted head trauma. Oftentimes this distinction is straightforward, but many times probabilities of injuries from accidental scenarios are unknown making the differential diagnosis difficult. For example, it is unknown whether intracranial hemorrhage (IH) can occur at a location other than a focal contact site following a low height fall. To create a foundation for predicting regional IH in infants, we sought to identify the biomechanical response and <b>injury</b> <b>threshold</b> best able to predict IH in 3 – 5 day old piglets. First, finite element (FE) model simulations of in situ animal studies were performed to ascertain the optimal representation of the pia-arachnoid complex, cerebrospinal fluid and cortical vasculature (PCC) for predicting brain strain and brain/skull displacement. Second, rapid head rotations resulting in various degrees of IH were simulated (n = 24) to determine the biomechanical predictor and <b>injury</b> <b>threshold</b> most closely correlated with IH. FE models representing the PCC with either spring connectors or solid elements between the brain and skull resulted in peak brain strain and brain/skull displacement similar to measured values in situ.
