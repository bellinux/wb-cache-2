There is a hide in the [...] north-west corner of my room in the old house, between the beam and [...] the wall. The key that is <b>enclosed</b> <b>herewith</b> will open it. I used to [...] hide baccy there in my smugglin' days, but since I left off that I've [...] never used it. There {{you will find a}} bag of gold. How much is in it [...] I know not. It was placed there by an old mate of mine more than [...] forty years ago. He was a great man for the guinea trade that was [...] carried on with France in the time of Boney's wars. I never rightly [...] myself {{understood}} that business. I'm told that Boney tried to get all [...] the gold out o' this country, by payin' three shillings more than each [...] guinea was worth for it, but that seems unreasonable to me. [...] Hows'ever, although I never could rightly understand it, there is no [...] doubt that some of our lads were consarned in smugglin' guineas across [...] the channel, and two or three of 'em made a good thing of it. My mate [...] was one o' the lucky ones. One night he came home with a bag o' gold [...] and tumbled it out on the table before me. I had my suspicions that [...] he had not come honestly by it, so would have nothin' to do with it. [...] When I told him so, he put it back into the bag, tied it up, and [...] replaced it in the hide, and went away in a rage. He never came back. [...] There was a storm from the east'ard that night. Two or three boats [...] were capsized, and my mate and one or two more lads were drowned. The [...] guineas have lain in the hide ever since. I've often thought o' usin' [...] them; but somehow or other never could make up my mind. You may call [...] this foolish, mayhap it was; anyhow I now leave the gold to you;--to [...] Tommy, if you never come back, or to Guy if he don't turn up. [...] Bluenose don't want it: it would only bother him if I put it in his [...] way.|$|E

40|$|The report <b>enclosed</b> <b>herewith</b> {{relates the}} {{construction}} history and interim performance of an experimental pavement in which coal tar (RT- 12) was substituted for asphalt cement (PAC- 5) ··all other design features were basically similar to asphaltic concrete paving projects abutting {{each end of}} the experimental section. The resulting tar mixtures were in general conformity with Mixes 4 T {base) and 7 T (surface) of ASTM D 1753 - 67. Although the Marshall stability was 3000 pounds at I 00 °F, the tar surface course has thinned in the wheel tracks and thickened outside the wheel paths. Tar mixes have insufficient strength to withstand testing at 140 °F. The greater. sensitivity of the tar to summer temperatures [...] together with very heavy wheel loads �- suffice to explain the greater rutting occurring in the tar surface than in the asphalt sections. Only the heavy wheel loads were unanticipated. Deflection measurements indicate that the tar concrete pavement is otherwise comparable to the two asphaltic concrete pavements abutting thereto. Leveling of the existing surface, together with an insulating overlay of asphaltic concrete, should restore the pavement to normal service capabilities. Whereas the report indicates that 4. 5 inches would be needed to restore the pavement to the original 20 -year design, I would recommend a 2. 5 -inch overlay (plus. 5 -inch allowance for leveling) at this time [...] thereby deferring the remaining 2 inches until a mor...|$|E
40|$|A {{recurring}} question is: "What effects will art {{increase in}} the sizes of tires and axleloads have on pavements? " Concern has mounted {{in regard to the}} so-called "drop-axle " not having dual wheels or proportioned loading. Presently, {{there seems to be a}} trend toward wide tires in lieu of dual wheels. The wide tires first appeared on the front (steering) axle. This trend seemingly represents an attempt to respect the statutory limit of 600 pounds of load per inch of tire width but to violate the axleload or wheel-load limits (KRS 189. 222). Whereas a dual-wheeled, single, rear axle having 10 -inch wide tires would be limited to a gross load of 20, 000 pounds, 600 pounds per inch of tire width would be 24, 000 pounds. A tandem set of axles (8 tires) is limited to a gross of 34, 000 pounds; 600 pounds would be 48, 000 pounds. An advantage is demonstrated clearly when it is shown that a 34, 000 -pound, tandem axle is not any more damaging than a 18, 000 -pound, single axle having dual wheels. A great disadvantage arises when a single axle without duals (such as the steering axle or "drop-axle") is loaded heavily without increasing the width of the tires. In the report <b>enclosed</b> <b>herewith</b> we have analyzed data from the AASHO Road Test to better defme the damage factors assignable to tandem axles. Several influences have been considered and documented. The effects of steering axles at the Test Road are somewhat confounded with the load axles. Separat...|$|E
