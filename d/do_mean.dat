500|$|Gallagher {{maintains}} that the rivalry was conceived by the magazine NME and members of Blur's entourage as a ploy to raise their respective profiles, and that since this point he has had no respect for either party. However, Albarn has suggested {{the roots of the}} feud were much more personal. By 2007, the tension between the two had cooled, and in an NME interview, Gallagher said [...] "I've got {{a lot of respect for}} Damon, I really <b>do</b> <b>mean</b> it. Because I'm indifferent to Damon he thinks that I think he's a cunt. Our Liam will talk to him, I won't because he's just another singer in a band to me, but I don't think he's a cunt. Good luck to him!" [...] On 23 March 2013, Gallagher, Damon, Graham Coxon and Paul Weller performed the Blur hit [...] "Tender" [...] at the Teenage Cancer Trust. Gallagher provided backing vocals on the song [...] "We Got the Power" [...] with Blur guitarist Graham Coxon, on Albarn's Gorillaz project, from their album Humanz.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2008, Duffy {{mentioned}} {{that she was}} [...] "on the borderline of a nervous breakdown" [...] because of the pressure that fame has brought her. She {{said that she had}} considered becoming a recluse, but eventually decided against the idea for the sake of her fans. Although acknowledging that most people <b>do</b> <b>mean</b> well, she finds it [...] "scary" [...] when people recognise her in the street, and has been fearful of her image possibly changing the person she truly is.|$|E
2500|$|On February 6, 2016 Garbage stated {{on their}} Facebook page that mixing was almost done: [...] "Our new record is an inch away, just an inch {{away from being}} done.

[...] Vig also confirmed {{the title of a}} new song, [...] "Even Though Our Love is Doomed". Three days later, Garbage announced that they had completed the album. Strange Little Birds, the band's sixth studio album, was released on June 10, 2016.|$|E

2500|$|When {{interviewed in}} 2007 by Beliefnet, a website that covers {{religious}} affairs, McCain {{was asked if}} he thought a non-Christian should be president of the United States. He answered, [...] "I just have to say in all candor that since this nation was founded primarily on Christian principles, personally, I prefer someone who has a grounding in my faith." [...] McCain also stated his agreement with the belief that the U.S. is a [...] "Christian nation." [...] On September 30, 2007, he clarified his remarks by saying [...] "What I <b>do</b> <b>mean</b> to say is the United States of America was founded on the values of Judeo-Christian values, which were translated by our founding fathers which is basically the rights of human dignity and human rights." [...] McCain also stated, “I would vote for a Muslim if he or she was the candidate best able to lead the country and defend our political values.” ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Elmore Magazines Mike Jurkovic, when It's Too Late To Stop Now {{was first}} {{released}} in 1974, [...] "everyone—and I <b>do</b> <b>mean</b> everyone—tripped over themselves to hail the two-LP set {{as one of}} the greatest live renderings of the rock era." [...] Reviewing the album in Creem, Robert Christgau hailed it as Morrison's best since Moondance (1970) while writing, [...] "Songs that wore poorly or were just lame in the first place have more force and tightness here than in their studio versions". Ken Emerson was somewhat less impressed in Rolling Stone: [...] "On It's Too Late Morrison's voice is in fine form, but much else is not...The other musicians, most of whom have played with Morrison many times before, never detract, but Morrison could be better served....But the power of Morrison's vocals overcomes these drawbacks." [...] At the end of 1974, It's Too Late to Stop Now was voted the 20th best album of the year in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics, published by The Village Voice. Ellen Willis, Greil Marcus, and Christgau ranked it 2nd, 6th, and 18th, respectively, in their ballots for the poll.|$|E
