This paper develops a set of functional guidelines for designing <b>electronic</b> <b>stores</b> and classifies them into three categories: motivational, hygiene, and media richness factors. An empirical study was conducted to evaluate the relative effect of these factors. The results show that the store design does have an effect on consumer purchase decision. A two-factor theory is plausible: hygiene factors are the major concern when consumers decide whether to shop electronically, while motivational factors play a key role when consumers choose among different <b>electronic</b> <b>stores.</b> Media richness factors are, in general, less important. The implication of the findings is that, for a web store to beat its electronic competitors, providing good transactional support is the key. If they would like to attract customers from traditional stores, special attentions must be paid to the hygiene factors...|$|R
