5|$|Although Pluto is {{currently}} the largest known KBO, {{there is at least}} one known larger object currently outside the Kuiper belt that probably originated in it: Neptune's moon Triton (which, as explained above, <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> captured KBO).|$|E
5|$|As {{argued in}} a recent study by Richard et al. however, the name Morchella importuna <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> later synonym of an old European taxon, such as Morchella elata, Morchella vaporaria or Morchella hortensis.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, 617 Patroclus was {{the first}} Jupiter trojan to be {{identified}} as a binary asteroid. The binary's orbit is extremely close, at 650km, compared to 35,000km for the primary's Hill sphere. The largest Jupiter trojan—624 Hektor— <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> contact binary with a moonlet.|$|E
50|$|Putney <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> settled {{during the}} Roman occupation. Lower Richmond Road <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> Roman Road, and the Lower Common <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>an</b> open pasture and farmland.|$|R
50|$|Lappa <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> {{colony of}} Tarrha.|$|R
50|$|The chorus <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> {{group of}} females.|$|R
5|$|In consequence, the West {{section of}} the Notitia does not {{accurately}} represent the western army structure as it stood in 395 (for which the eastern structure <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> better guide).|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table of the elements, copernicium is a d-block transactinide element. During reactions with gold, {{it has been shown}} to be an extremely volatile metal and a group 12 element, so much so that it <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> gas at standard temperature and pressure.|$|E
5|$|Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute {{believes}} the outer planets {{show signs of}} collisions with plutoids 1,000 to 2,000 kilometers in diameter: Uranus could have been tipped off its axis by a plutoid, and Triton, the largest moon of Neptune, <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> captured plutoid from the Kuiper belt.|$|E

50|$|Tariccoia arrusensis <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> marine bottom dweller.|$|R
50|$|Frithegod <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> {{native of}} France, as {{his name is}} {{obviously}} not Anglo-Saxon, and <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>an</b> attempt to Anglicize the Frankish name Fredegaud. Where in France he originated is unknown, as is when he met Oda. It {{may have been in}} 936, when Oda visited France.|$|R
5|$|Considered {{the most}} {{specialized}} member of its family, the tasselled wobbegong's ornate coloration and complex dermal fringe grants it excellent camouflage, while it <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> slower swimmer than related species. It is solitary and {{spends most of}} the day lying motionless inside caves or under ledges with its tail curled up. Individual sharks have a small home range, containing several preferred resting spots that are used repeatedly. This species becomes more active at night, swimming onto the reef to hunt.|$|E
5|$|The keep {{was inside}} the inner bailey and {{contained}} the king's accommodation. It had two rooms: an antechamber and an audience room. While Allen Brown interpreted the audience room as the king's chamber, historian Liddiard believes it <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> throne room. A throne room emphasises the political importance of the castle. In England there is nothing similar to Château Gaillard's keep, but there are buildings with a similar design in France in the 12th and 13th centuries.|$|E
5|$|Although the skulls are incompletely preserved, CT {{scanning}} {{suggests that}} each premaxilla held five incisors, with the sockets becoming progressively larger {{from the first}} to the fifth incisor. Like other theriodonts, the crowns of the incisors are conical; they also lack serrations, unlike gorgonopsians and scylacosaurian therocephalians. The interior edge of the incisors seems to be slightly concave, and the back edge {{appears to have a}} ridge. The smaller specimen has a displaced incisor preserved within its nasal cavity; it is more strongly recurved and has wear marks on its top edge, suggesting that it <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> lower incisor. Its fourth incisor also has a replacement tooth growing behind it, accompanied by resorption of the root.|$|E
50|$|The scribe of Uncial 0162 <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> professional.|$|R
50|$|Bolbolenellus <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> marine bottom dweller, {{like all}} Olenellina.|$|R

5|$|Fireflies use {{light to}} attract mates. Two systems are {{involved}} according to species; in one, females emit light from their abdomens to attract males; in the other, flying males emit signals {{to which the}} sometimes sedentary females respond. Click beetles emit an orange light from the abdomen when flying and a green light from the thorax when they are disturbed or moving about on the ground. The former <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> sexual attractant but the latter may be defensive. Larvae of the click beetle Pyrophorus nyctophanus live in the surface layers of termite mounds in Brazil. They light up the mounds by emitting a bright greenish glow which attracts the flying insects on which they feed.|$|E
5|$|Four years later, Taylor was {{selected}} for the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm. In the 4×200m freestyle relay, he helped his team win bronze. There were no Olympic Games in 1916 because of the First World War. Taylor joined the Royal Navy in 1914 and kept fit by swimming around the ships when his ship was anchored at Scapa Flow. He {{was present at the}} Battle of Jutland. A popular story tells that {{during the course of the}} battle, his ship, HMS St. Vincent, was sunk and while the survivors waited for two hours to be rescued, Taylor swam around encouraging his crewmates. However, this story <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> myth as HMS St Vincent was not sunk at the Battle of Jutland. He was transferred to HMS Ramillies where he remained until he was demobilised.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the regular cast and Lathan, actor Bob Gunton, voice actor Julius Sharpe, and actress Jennifer Tilly, who portrayed the sheriff, warden, UPS Guy and Bonnie Swanson, respectively, guest starred in the episode. Recurring guest voice actors Danny Smith, writer Alec Sulkin, voice actor Ralph Garman, and writer John Viener made minor appearances throughout the episode. Recurring cast members Adam West, and Patrick Warburton also appeared in the episode, portraying the characters of Adam West and Joe Swanson, respectively. Bob Gunton's voicing of the warden <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> nod to his most famous role, that of the warden in the film The Shawshank Redemption.|$|E
50|$|The diet of {{this species}} <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>an</b> encrusting bryozoan.|$|R
50|$|Although {{his father}} <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> Welsh speaker, his mother <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>an</b> English-speaker {{and he was}} educated entirely in English. His fluency and love of Welsh came from the {{minister}} of their Calvinist Methodist chapel, Rev Daniel Jenkyns, who married his sister Mary and was greatly admired by the young poet.|$|R
50|$|Hugh (fl. 1023 - 1040) was the Count of Suio in the Duchy of Gaeta. He <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> son of Docibilis magnificus, {{who in turn}} <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> son of Landolf, son of Gregory, Duke of Gaeta, and Landolf's {{mistress}} Polyssena (Pulessene). He was {{a brother}} of Duke Leo II of Gaeta.|$|R
5|$|In the original, 7th-century charter {{recording}} this grant, Reculver {{is referred}} to as a civitas, or city, but this <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> reference to either its Roman past or the church's monastic status, rather than a large population centre. In 692 Reculver's abbot Berhtwald was elected Archbishop of Canterbury, from which position he probably offered Reculver patronage and support. Bede, writing no more than 40 years later, described Berhtwald as having been well educated in the Bible and experienced in ecclesiastical and monastic affairs, but in terms indicating that Berhtwald was not a scholar.|$|E
5|$|Juliomys anoblepas is a rodent in {{the genus}} Juliomys of the {{subfamily}} Sigmodontinae known {{from a single}} broken skull. The specimen was collected by Peter Wilhelm Lund in the caves of Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais, Brazil, {{in the first half}} of the 19th century and described by Herluf Winge in 1887 as Calomys anoblepas. The species remained unstudied and its affinities unclear until 2011, when it was recognized as a member of the genus Juliomys, which includes three other species from southern Brazil and nearby Argentina and Paraguay. J.anoblepas <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> separate extinct species of the genus, which is no longer found at Lagoa Santa.|$|E
5|$|Montagu {{was created}} Earl of Salisbury on 16 March 1337. This {{was one of}} six comital {{promotions}} Edward III made that day, in preparation for {{what was to become}} the Hundred Years' War. To allow Montagu to support his new status, the king granted him land and rent of a value of 1000 marks a year. The money was provided from the royal stannaries of Cornwall. A contemporary poem tells of a vow made by the earl {{on the eve of the}} warshe would not open one of his eyes while fighting in France. The story <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> satire; the truth was that Montagu had already lost the use of one of his eyes in a tournament.|$|E
50|$|Biceratops nevadensis <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> marine bottom dweller, {{like all}} Olenellina.|$|R
50|$|E. angustispina <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> marine bottom dweller, {{like all}} Olenellina.|$|R

5|$|On Enterprise, {{analysis}} of data gathered in the previous encounter with the Romulan ship reveals that the ship is being piloted telepathically by an Andorian. Commander Shran (Jeffrey Combs) explains that the data indicates that the pilot <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> member of the Aenar, a white-skinned and blind Andorian sub-race. This, however, seems unlikely, since the Aenar are few in number, reclusive pacifists, and inhabitants of the isolated extreme northern polar region of their moon. Shran and Captain Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) then beam down to contact the Aenar. The Aenar's spokesperson, Lissan (Alicia Adams), initially declines to assist as the Aenar {{do not want to}} get involved in a war. However, a young Aenar named Jhamel (Alexandra Lydon) decides to help, since doing so may help locate Gareb (Scott Allen Rinker), her missing brother.|$|E
5|$|Petersham Gate {{served the}} Russell School, {{replacing}} the more ornate gates to Petersham Lodge. A disused carriage gate further {{up the hill}} was probably a tradesman's entrance to the school or to the Lodge stables. Bishop's Gate in Chisholm Road, previously known as the Cattle Gate, was for use by livestock allowed to pasture in the nineteenth century. It was opened for public use in 1896. Kitchen Garden Gate, hidden behind Teck Plantation, <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> nineteenth-century gate. It has never been open to the public. Cambrian Gate or Cambrian Road Gate was constructed during World War I {{for access to the}} newly built South Africa Military Hospital. When the hospital was demolished in 1925, the entrance was made permanent and public as a pedestrian gate.|$|E
5|$|Skulls of P. mongoliensis {{are flat}} on top, {{especially}} {{over the back}} of the skull, with a triangular depression, the antorbital fossa, on the outside surface of the maxilla (an upper jaw bone). A flange is present on the lower edge of the dentary (the tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw), although it is not as prominent as in P. meileyingensis or P. major (=P. lujiatunensis). P. mongoliensis is among the largest known species. The skull of the type specimen, which <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> juvenile, is 15.2centimetres (6in) long, and the associated femur is 16.2centimetres (6.4in) in length. Other specimens are larger, with the largest documented femur measuring about 21centimetres (8.25in) long.|$|E
