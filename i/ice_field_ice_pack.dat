Discussions were also made whether or not the hypothetical idea of the concentration of meteorites within a limited area is possible, in terms of a mass budget study in the present drainage system. The result revealed that, if a number of meteorites had once fallen uniformly over the hinterland of the drainages of the Shirase Glacier and of the Meteorite <b>Ice</b> <b>Field,</b> more than 95 % of the meteorites were drained off through the coast of the ice sheet, and only a few percent of them were conveyed to and exposed on the bare <b>ice</b> <b>field</b> around the Yamato Mountains...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] The {{mechanics}} of <b>ice</b> <b>fields,</b> {{in order to}} be well analyzed, requires a realistic model admitting the intrinsic microstructure of random physical and geometrical characteristics. When the <b>field</b> of <b>pack</b> <b>ice</b> possesses a single characteristic size at the microscale (scale of tens to hundreds of meters), a planar graph representation provides a convenient framework for the description of the <b>ice</b> <b>field's</b> micromechanics by the discrete fields of deformation and interaction force. A relationship between the latter two quantities specifies the microscale constitutive behavior of the particular <b>ice</b> <b>field,</b> and is taken here, in case of tightly <b>packed</b> <b>ice,</b> {{in the form of a}} linear elastic/viscoplastic law. Finally, a statistical continuum model for finite motions of the <b>ice</b> <b>field</b> is derived as an equivalent approximation to the original graph-based random field model. Both these models provide a basis for further micro and macromechanical analyses to be reported in subsequent papers.

40|$|A {{motion of}} an {{individual}} <b>ice</b> <b>field</b> in the Arctic Ocean was monitored at the Russian research station North Pole 35 established on the <b>ice</b> <b>pack</b> in 2008. The <b>ice</b> <b>field</b> velocity (V) {{was found to be}} correlated with wind velocity (v) in main features, such as the positions of maxima and minima of V and v. However, the fine structure of the V-variation cannot be explained by the wind forcing only. There were periods of time when the field drift was highly affected by either the tidal activity or the interactions of ice sheets between each other. These data were put in comparison with the "waiting times" statistics that is with the distributions of lengths of time intervals between subsequent important local accelerations of the <b>ice</b> <b>field.</b> These distributions were measured in several time windows differing in the average wind velocity and/or the mechanical state of the <b>ice</b> <b>pack.</b> The distribution functions N(&gt;&tau;) (N is the number of successive events of accelerations separated by the time interval that exceeds τ) constructed in different time windows demonstrated fractal or multifractal nature in the consolidated <b>ice</b> <b>pack</b> but were truly random when the <b>ice</b> <b>field</b> drifted in the highly fragmented sea ice.

25|$|Canada {{was nearly}} {{completely}} covered by ice, {{as well as}} {{the northern part of the}} United States, both blanketed by the huge Laurentide ice sheet.

In Britain, mainland Europe, and northwestern Asia, the Scandinavian ice sheet once again reached the northern parts of the British Isles, Germany, Poland, and Russia, extending as far east as the Taimyr Peninsula in western Siberia. The maximum extent of western Siberian glaciation was reached by approximately 16,000–15,000BCE and thus later than in Europe (BCE). Northeastern Siberia was not covered by a continental-scale ice sheet.

The correspondence between the continuum random medium and the discrete spherical scatter model can be verified when the vertical correlation length is equal to the horizontal correlation length. The vertically polarized backscattering cross section sigma (sub vv) is always greater than the horizontally polarized backscattering cross section sigma (sub hh) for half space scattering media and may become smaller for a two layer model. In order to account for diurnal change exhibited by snow fields in both the active and passive remote sensing cases, a three layer model with a thin top layer caused by solar illumination must be used...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] The graph model {{presented}} in Part I {{of this series}} provides the basis for development of a computer simulation of tightly <b>packed</b> <b>ice</b> <b>fields</b> taken as ensembles of square-shaped icefloes with random physical properties. A program based on an alternating-direction scheme is developed to model the time evolution of a <b>field</b> of <b>ice</b> floes in a rectangular domain. The simulation of a field in an Arctic channel shows {{that there is a}} strong tendency for an earlier onset of microscale plastic flows and formation of irregular clusters of ice floes and openings in a field with spatially random properties versus a field with deterministic spatially homogeneous properties. A special study is conducted of an elastic-plastic transition in a field of 101 x 101 floes. The transition to macroscopically plastic flow is possible only with a percolation of inelastic regions through the entire domain of the <b>ice</b> <b>field.</b> The fact that this percolation is characterized by a noninteger f actal dimension uncovers a (possibly principal) generation mechanism of <b>ice</b> <b>field</b> morphologies, and points to scale dependence in mechanics of <b>ice</b> <b>fields</b> for certain ranges of loads.

25|$|Both bandy and {{ice hockey}} were played in Europe during the 20th century, {{especially}} in Sweden, Finland, and Norway.

40|$|The {{attenuation}} {{of radio}} waves within the ice sheet {{is caused by}} absorption loss due to dielectric and electric properties of ice and geometric loss due to spreading of radio waves. The dielectric structure of the ice sheet can be derived by estimating the attenuation. This estimation is useful {{for the design of}} the future radio echo sounder. The inland traverse party of the 23 rd Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition in 1982 measured an ice thickness by radio echo sounding which operated on 60 MHz. Calculations of the attenuation rate of radio waves were made by reading the rate of decrease of the strength of internal echoes on the photographs of the A-scope display records. Values of the attenuation coefficient (dB/ 100 m) in the present study change between about 1. 2 and about 3,and become smaller with increase of surface elevation of the ice sheet. But the attenuation coefficient in the bare <b>ice</b> <b>field,</b> the Meteorite <b>Ice</b> <b>Field,</b> around the Yamato Mountains is remarkably high. The regional difference of the attenuation coefficient is caused mainly by the temperature distribution with depth in the ice sheet. But it is considered that the high value of the effective attenuation coefficient in the bare <b>ice</b> <b>field</b> is due to not only different temperature distribution but also different dielectric properties of the bare ice...|$|R

The Glacier Inventory of the USSR and the World Atlas of Snow and Ice Resources records a total of 26, 881 glaciers, 1, 983 in the Russian Arctic, and 24, 898 in Russia and in the four independent republics. Information from the Glacier Inventory, World Atlas, Landsat 1, 2, and 3 MSS images from the 10 -year Landsat Baseline Period (1972 – 1981), Soviet space imagery, aerial photographs, and maps were used to provide information on the glacierized areas. Russian glaciologists recognize 20 morphological types of mountain glaciers and 7 types of <b>ice</b> caps, <b>ice</b> <b>fields,</b> and <b>ice</b> sheets from a global perspective (World Atlas).

Analysis of changes in smaller glaciers was not possible with the limitations of pixel resolution (80 m) of MSS images. Later Landsat TM and more recent Landsat ETM+ and ASTER images have overcome the spatial resolution problem.
