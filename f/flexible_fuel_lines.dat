500|$|On 5 May 1998, a fire {{broke out}} onboard [...] while off the Western Australia coast. The fire {{was caused by the}} rupture of a <b>flexible</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>line</b> (one of a number used to replace rigid hoses) on {{cylinder}} number nine, starboard engine. This sprayed diesel fuel onto a hot indicator cock, which ignited a spray fire, resulting in the deaths of four crew. Following the fire, the Australian Government and the RAN began a major investigation known as the Westralia Board of Inquiry. The enquiry found that the RAN and the contractor Australian Defence Industries (ADI) did not critically examine their course of action and that key personnel in both the RAN and the contractor were insufficiently trained and qualified. The inquiry also found that the hoses were not properly designed and were unfit for the intended purpose. In 2005, ADI was fined $75,000 for failing to provide a safe workplace. Seven sailors who were severely traumatised by the fire have also sued ADI and subcontractor Jetrock. In August 2006, the Australian Government decided to accept liability after it reached settlement with the ADI and Jetrock. The seven sailors stand to receive compensation totalling up to $10million.|$|R

50|$|The early {{tanks were}} of welded {{aluminium}} structure with the sealing material applied as a composite layer on the outside.

5000|$|Reacting to {{the high}} price of oil and its growing {{dependence}} on imports, in 1975 Brazil launched the Pro-alcool program, a huge government-subsidized effort to manufacture ethanol fuel (from its sugar cane crop) and ethanol-powered automobiles. These ethanol-only vehicles were very popular in the 1980s, but became economically impractical when oil prices fell - and sugar prices rose - late in that decade. In May 2003 Volkswagen built {{for the first time a}} commercial ethanol <b>flexible</b> <b>fuel</b> car, the Gol 1.6 Total Flex. These vehicles were a commercial success and by early 2009 other nine Brazilian manufacturers are producing <b>flexible</b> <b>fuel</b> vehicles: Chevrolet, Fiat, Ford, Peugeot, Renault, Honda, Mitsubishi, Toyota, Citroën, and Nissan. The adoption of the flex technology was so rapid, that <b>flexible</b> <b>fuel</b> cars reached 87.6% of new car sales in July 2008. As of August 2008, the fleet of [...] "flex" [...] automobiles and light commercial vehicles had reached 6 million new vehicles sold, representing almost 19% of all registered light vehicles.
