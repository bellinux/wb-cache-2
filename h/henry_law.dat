On the way, Law stopped at the barracks of the Royston troop of volunteer yeomanry cavalry and requested they go to Ely. Law was unable to convince Sidmouth of the seriousness of the situation, and Sidmouth asked Reverend Sir Henry Bate Dudley to return with Law and report on the matter.|$|E

They marched through the streets as a show of force, remaining all night. The following afternoon, 24 May, the troops marched on Littleport, led by Sir Henry Bate Dudley and John Bacon, a Bow Street constable. They were followed by the Royston troop of volunteer yeomanry cavalry summoned earlier by <b>Henry</b> <b>Law,</b> and a militia of gentlemen and inhabitants of Ely.|$|E

5|$|The palace was {{originally}} {{surrounded by a}} medieval deer park. When the walls were built, streams were diverted to form the moat as a reservoir. In the 1820s, the grounds within the walls were planted and laid out as pleasure grounds by Bishop George <b>Henry</b> <b>Law,</b> who created a reflecting pond near the springs. Parts of the buildings are still used as a residence by the current bishop, however much of the palace is now used for public functions and as a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{existing}} landscaping {{on the south lawn}} was carried out by Bishop George <b>Henry</b> <b>Law</b> in the 1820s. This included the incorporation of the remains of the roofless great hall and the construction of a raised rampart around the inside of the wall accessible from one of the towers. Bishop Law also created a grotto which he used to display fossils from Banwell Caves which were also part of his estate. A range of tress and shrubs were planted including: a black walnut, Lebanon cedar, catalpa and ginkgo. In the 1830s, Bishop Law had a pool created next to the springs. This acts as a mirror on a still day providing reflections of the east end of the cathedral in the water.|$|E

His brother Edward Law, 1st Baron Ellenborough, served as Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales from 1802 to 1818. Another brother, George <b>Henry</b> <b>Law,</b> became Bishop of Chester in 1812 and Bishop of Bath and Wells in 1824. Thomas Law spent many years in India, where he made a fortune in trade.|$|E

However, its experimental determination for multi-component gases in presence of complex liquids remains problematic in the process industry and research field. This work presents a new experimental setup built to measure <b>Henry's</b> <b>law</b> constants easily. The apparatus brings gas and liquid phases into contact before and after equilibrium in medium pressure conditions (from 1 to 10 bars). Thanks to standard sensors, temperature, pressure and phase concentrations of the components are recorded continuously, permitting to calculate the <b>Henry's</b> <b>law</b> constant. Three types of water were tested and put in contact with a real biogas mix. <b>Henry's</b> <b>law</b> constants for carbon dioxide and methane were obtained with good accuracy and {{were consistent with the}} values reported in the literature for tap water. Results obtained with the apparatus show that values of <b>Henry's</b> <b>law</b> constant can differ between tap water and recycled water. Carbon dioxide absorption is strongly reduced when recycled water is used. We can conclude that the proposed apparatus is a convenient experimental set up for determining <b>Henry's</b> <b>law</b> constants with good accuracy and as it is movable it can be helpful for engineer in charge of biogas upgrading system...|$|R

500|$|The rioters in Littleton had in {{the interim}} stolen a wagon and horses from Henry Tansley and {{equipped}} it with fowling guns front and back. Most of the Littleton mob, armed with guns and pitch-forks, then began the march to Ely, arriving three-quarters of a mile (1.2km) {{north of the city}} between 5am and 6am on 23 May. The Reverend William Metcalfe met them, read the Riot Act, and asked what the mob required. On being told that they wanted [...] "the price of a stone of flour per day" [...] and that [...] "our children are starving, give us a living wage," [...] the Reverend agreed but stated {{that he would have to}} converse with the other magistrates. He asked everyone to return to Littleport, but they marched on. Metcalfe implored them to go to the market place and many did go there, where they were joined by Ely citizens. Recognising the needs of the rioters, the Ely magistrates, the Reverends William Metcalfe, Peploe Ward and <b>Henry</b> <b>Law</b> drafted a response, offering poor families two-shillings per head per week and ordering farmers to pay two-shillings (£) per day wages. On hearing the proclamation, the mob cheered. The magistrates then [...] "gave the men some beer, told them not to get drunk and tried to persuade them to go home". Some took the advice, whilst others continued the rampage, intimidating shopkeepers, millers and bankers and stealing from some. However, most of the rioters, marching with their wagons and guns, left the city for Littleport before the arrival of the military from Bury.|$|E

The <b>Henry’s</b> <b>law</b> constants measured in this study agree well with literature. The <b>Henry’s</b> <b>law</b> constants increase with temperature and carbonate concentration. The model of Weisenberger and Schumpe agrees well with measured data at 25  ∘C, but it underestimates the <b>Henry’s</b> <b>law</b> constant at higher temperatures. Overall mass transfer coefficients for potassium and sodium carbonate increase with temperature but decreases with concentration at high concentrations. Potassium carbonate solutions have higher overall mass transfer coefficients than sodium carbonate.
