Empirical results {{based on a}} structural autoregression framework suggest that fiscal policy {{can be used for}} demand management, although the impact may be somewhat short lived. The short-lived impact could reflect a number of factors, including the absence of credit-constrained economic agents, a high propensity to save among households, monetary focus on price stability, and leakages due to economic openness. Notwithstanding, fiscal policy should still play a key stabilizing role in the current downturn given the downside risks to growth and the vast fiscal space.

40|$|The {{discussion}} of influence of fiscal consolidation on {{economic growth is}} quite interesting and important topic. Consequently, the main aim of the article is to determine diff erences within the influence of fiscal deficit on the economic growth, which is caused by changes in certain groups of government expenditures and revenues. We focus on two different economic growth indicators. The first is growth rate of real GDP {{and the second is}} growth rate of potential output. The panel regression method is used which data covers 13 old EU member states in 1996 to 2013. We employ the omitted <b>fiscal</b> <b>variable</b> approach. There is a hint that every deficit to revenue substitution has no significant growth effect. The results of expenditures imply, that government should reduce deficit created by debt service. The measure has relatively stronger effect on supply side. Potential output growth can also be supported by the deficit decrease of social expenditures. Lowering government consumption is detrimental to GDP, but it is not to potential output. There are some differences between results of two types of growth. Hence government should decide, if consolidation effect is considered against GDP or potential output at first. Web of Science 64219217...|$|E

The purpose of this comment is analyze further the relation between planned and actual fiscal stance and to explain why characterizing and measuring this relation has important policy implications. Figure 1, using the dataset put together by Beetsma, Giulodori and Wierts (henceforth BGW), plots actual v/s planned expenditure to GDP ratios in a number of EU countries for the period 2001 - 2010. The figure shows that planned expenditures are only an imperfect predictor of actual expenditures as for many countries there is a considerable distance between the thick solid line line (actual expenditure ratio in a given year) and the thin dashed, dot-dashed and dotted lines (expenditures ratios planned for 1, 2 and 3 years in advance).

After testing five fiscal measures - government expenditure, consumption, investment, non-oil revenue, and non-oil primary balance - and correcting for reverse causality between non-oil output and fiscal variables, {{the results suggest}} that all of the five fiscal variables are strongly procyclical in the full sample. Also, the results are not uniform across income groups: expenditure is procyclical in the low and middle-income countries, while it is countercyclical in the high-income countries. Fiscal policy tends to be affected by the external financing constraints in the middle- and high-income groups. However, the quality of institutions and political structure appear to be more significant for the low-income group.

Using {{a variant of the}} model by Curdia and Woodford (2009), we study a "sovereign risk channel" through which sovereign default risk raises funding costs in the private sector. If monetary policy is constrained, the sovereign risk channel exacerbates indeterminacy problems: private-sector beliefs of a weakening economy may become self-fulfilling. In addition, sovereign risk amplifies the effects of negative cyclical shocks. Under those conditions, fiscal retrenchment can help curtail the risk of macroeconomic instability and, in extreme cases, even stimulate economic activity.
