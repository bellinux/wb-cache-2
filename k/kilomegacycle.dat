5000|$|For higher frequencies, kilocycles (kc), as an {{abbreviation}} of kilocycles {{per second}} were often used on components or devices. Other higher units like megacycle (Mc) and less commonly <b>kilomegacycle</b> (kMc) were used before 1960and in some later documents. [...] These have modern equivalents such as kilohertz (kHz), megahertz (MHz), and gigahertz (GHz).|$|E
50|$|The hertz {{is named}} after the German {{physicist}} Heinrich Hertz (1857-1894), who made important scientific contributions {{to the study of}} electromagnetism. The name was established by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in 1930. It was adopted by the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) (Conférence générale des poids et mesures) in 1960, replacing the previous name for the unit, cycles per second (cps), along with its related multiples, primarily kilocycles per second (kc/s) and megacycles per second (Mc/s), and occasionally <b>kilomegacycles</b> per second (kMc/s). The term cycles per second was largely replaced by hertz by the 1970s. One hobby magazine, Electronics Illustrated, declared their intention to stick with the traditional kc., Mc., etc. units.|$|R
