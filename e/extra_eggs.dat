By feeding {{in the form of a}} refreshing juice will hopefully can increase the food intake, which is expected to help improve albumin and hemoglobin (Hb) in blood level. Objective: The aim of this research is knowing the effect of egg white juice of the albumin and Hb levels in patients hipoalbumin. Method: This type of research is experimental approach with pretest-posttest control group design. While the treatment effect assessed from differences in measurement results (albumin and Hb level) between the 2 groups. The study was conducted in Sardjito and P. Senopati Bantul Hospital. The  treatment group will be given a hospital standard diet and given <b>extra</b> <b>egg</b> white juice 3 x/day for 7 consecutive days. The control group was given a hospital standard diet and <b>extra</b> <b>egg</b> white as a side dish. Data were analyzed using t-test with 95 % CI.

5000|$|Originally {{proposed}} by Dorward (1962), the insurance egg hypothesis (IEH) has quickly {{become the most}} widely supported explanation for avian siblicide {{as well as the}} overproduction of eggs in siblicidal birds.

When both eggs hatch successfully, the second chick, or B-chick, is known as the marginal offspring; otherwise stated, it is marginal in the sense that it can add to or subtract from the evolutionary success of its family members. It can increase reproductive and evolutionary success in two primary ways. Firstly, it represents an extra unit of parental success if it survives along with its siblings. In the context of Hamilton's inclusive fitness theory, the marginal chick increases the total number of offspring successfully produced by the parent and therefore adds to the gene pool that the parent bird passes to the next generation. Secondly, it can serve as a replacement for any of its siblings that do not hatch or die prematurely.|$|E

40|$|The {{costs of}} egg {{production}} and incubation {{may have a}} crucial effect on avian reproductive decisions, such as clutch size and the timing of reproduction. We carried out a brood-size enlargement experiment on the great tit (Parus major), in which the birds had to lay and incubate <b>extra</b> <b>eggs</b> (full costs), only incubate <b>extra</b> <b>eggs</b> (free eggs) or did not pay an) extra cost (free chicks) in obtaining a larger brood. We used female fitness (half the recruits produced plus female survival) as a fitness measure {{because it is the}} female which pays the costs of egg production and incubation, and because clutch size is under female control. Female fitness decreased with increasing costs (fitness of free chicks females is higher than that of free eggs females which is higher than that of full costs females). These fitness differences were due to differences in female survival rather than in the number of recruits produced. This {{is the first time that}} the costs of egg production and incubation have been estimated using such a complete fitness measure, including, as our measure does, the local survival to the following year of both the female and her offspring.

40|$|We used doubly {{labelled}} {{water to}} study the field metabolic rates of breeding Kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla during the incubation phase, and to compare these with the metabolic rates of Kittiwakes rearing chicks. During the incubation phase, birds with two eggs spent an average (± SE) of 915 ± 134 kJ day- 1. This was similar to published estimates of Kittiwake energy expenditure during the chick-rearing phase, and similar to our own measurements of metabolic rates in {{a small number of}} birds rearing two chicks (863 ± 177 kJ day- 1). Our results corroborate the current view that incubation is not a phase of low energy expenditure, even in a large bird like the Kittiwake, and even in a species where both parents incubate. There was high variability of energy expenditure between birds, and this was largely because birds spent varying proportions of their time on and off the nest and did not show simple diurnal cycles under the conditions of 24 hour daylight. Birds spent 559 ± 197 kJ day- 1 while at the nest, and 1241 ± 154 kJ day- 1 away. Males had higher energy expenditure than females, and this was because they spent more time off the nest, not because they were bigger. There was no evidence that metabolic rates were influenced by wind speed or temperature. In order to look at whether birds had to work harder to incubate larger clutches we placed an <b>extra</b> <b>egg</b> in some nests and measured metabolic rates of the adults.

40|$|Drosophila melanogaster male {{accessory}} gland proteins (Acps) {{that are}} transferred in the ejaculate with sperm mediate post–mating competition for fertilizations between males. The actions of Acps include effects on oviposition and ovulation, receptivity and sperm storage. Two Acps that modulate egg production are Acp 26 Aa (ovulin) and Acp 70 A (the sex peptide). Acp 26 Aa acts {{specifically on the}} process of ovulation (the release of mature eggs from the ovaries), which is initiated 1. 5 h after mating. In contrast, sperm storage can take as long as 6 – 9 h to complete. Initial ovulations after matings by virgin females will therefore occur before all sperm are fully stored and the <b>extra</b> <b>eggs</b> initially laid as a result of Acp 26 Aa transfer are expected to be inefficiently fertilized. Acp 26 Aa–mediated release of existing eggs should not cause a significant energetic cost or lead to a decrease in female lifespan assuming, as seems likely, that the energetic cost of egg laying comes from de novo egg synthesis (oogenesis) rather than from ovulation. We tested these predictions using Acp 26 Aa 1 mutant males that lack Acp 26 Aa but are normal for other Acps and Acp 26 Aa 2 males that transfer a truncated but fully functional Acp 26 Aa protein. Females mating with Acp 26 Aa 2 (truncation) males that received functional Acp 26 Aa produced significantly more eggs following their first matings than did mates of Acp 26 Aa 1 (null) males. However, as predicted above, these <b>extra</b> <b>eggs,</b> which were laid as a result of Acp 26 Aa transfer to virgin females, showed significantly lower egg hatchability. Control experiments indicated that this lower hatchability was due to lower rates of fertilization at early post–mating times. There was no drop in egg hatchability in subsequent non–virgin matings. In addition, as predicted above, females that did or did not receive Acp 26 Aa did not differ in survival, lifetime fecundity or lifetime progeny, indicating that Acp 26 Aa transfer does not represent a significant energetic cost for females and does not contribute to the survival cost of mating. Acp 26 Aa appears to remove a block to oogenesis by causing the clearing out of existing mature eggs and, thus, indirectly allowing oogenesis to be initiated immediately after mating. The results show that subtle processes coordinate the stimulation of egg production and sperm storage in mating pairs...|$|E

Furthermore, the few experimental studies that have manipulated production costs have not yet teased apart effects that operate via the parental phenotype from effects {{on the quality of the}} resulting young. To examine whether increased egg production influences parental brood rearing capacity independently of effects operating via egg quality, we experimentally increased egg production in gulls and then examined their capacity to rear a control clutch. We found that the capacity of parents to rear the control brood was substantially reduced solely as a consequence of having themselves produced one <b>extra</b> <b>egg.</b> The paradox that, in many species, parents apparently aim for fewer young per breeding event than the experimentally and theoretically demonstrated optimum, has partly arisen from the failure to take into account the constraints imposed by production costs...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The Oregon State University Production Line of Single Comb White Leghorns {{was under}} {{selection}} for increased henhoused egg production from 1947 through 1972. Since henhoused egg production {{is directly related}} to mortality, mortality would be expected to decrease over the years if selection was effective. To determine if the mortality had decreased and to gain a comprehensive view of the problem that mortality presents, the laying house mortality during a 23 year period, 1950 through 1972, was analyzed. Analysis of percent mortality in the flock between 20 and 68 weeks of age showed a decrease of slightly over fourtenths of a percent per year, about 10 percent during the entire period studied, or a 50 percent decrease from the original level. The average length of life in the laying house increased by about 16 days during the 23 year period. At 70 percent production this translates to 11 <b>extra</b> <b>eggs</b> in a 48 week laying period. Mortality was lowest {{in the early part of}} the laying year and reached its peak when the birds were between 57 and 60 weeks of age. Over three-fourths of the production time lost due to mortality occurred in the first half of the laying year. Leukosis claimed more of the flock than any other disease and most of the deaths from this disease occurred in the early part of the laying year.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{successfully}} derive {{human embryonic stem}} cells (hESC) lines from human embryos following in vitro fertilization (IVF) opened up a plethora of potential applications of this technique. These cell lines could have been successfully used to increase our understanding of human developmental biology, transplantation medicine and the emerging science of regenerative medicine. The main source for human embryos has been ′discarded′ or ′spare′ fresh or frozen human embryos following IVF. It is a common practice to stimulate the ovaries of women undergoing any of the assisted reproductive technologies (ART) and retrieve multiple oocytes which subsequently lead to multiple embryos. Of these, only two or maximum of three embryos are transferred while the rest are cryopreserved as per {{the decision of the}} couple. In case a couple does not desire to ′cryopreserve′ their embryos then all the embryos remaining following embryo transfer can be considered ′spare′ or if a couple is no longer in need of the ′cryopreserved′ embryos then these also can be considered as ′spare′. But, the question raised by the ethicists is, "what about ′slightly′ over-stimulating a woman to get a few <b>extra</b> <b>eggs</b> and embryos? The decision becomes more difficult when it comes to ′discarded′ embryos. As of today, the quality of the embryos is primarily assessed based on morphology and the rate of development mainly judged by single point assessment.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} increased egg production on body condition {{as well as on}} measures of reproductive performance in great skuas, Stercorarius skua, over two subsequent years. We experimentally increased egg production from the normal two to six eggs. Six eggs might also be produced under natural circumstances after repeated clutch loss. After the production of the last egg we measured: (i) body mass, (ii) pectoral muscle, and (iii) haematocrit, total red blood cell count and mean corpuscular volume, as indicators of body condition. We took the same measurements of control females who had produced the normal clutch of two eggs. The measurements were repeated one year after the manipulation, and survival, laying dates, clutch sizes and hatching success were recorded for up to three consecutive years. After producing six eggs, females were lighter, had smaller pectoral muscles and lower haematological values than control females. Hatching success of eggs was significantly reduced. Even one year after the experiment there were still differences in body condition. Annual survival was not affected by the manipulations, although there was an indication that survival costs depended on whether chicks were raised after the increased egg production. While pair bonds and egg sizes were not affected in the post-experimental year, females started breeding significantly later than in the previous year. Two years after the experiment laying dates had advanced again and were not different from those of control females. This pattern of maintaining survival and egg sizes, but delaying breeding in the post-experimental year was found for two independent groups of females which had both been subjected to increased egg production. These results present evidence that increased egg production can have long-term effects on female body condition and aspects of reproduction.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. African Black Oystercatchers (Haematopus moquini) have a modal clutch size of two eggs but {{occasionally}} lay one or three eggs. It {{has been noted}} that an increase in frequency of larger threeand even four-egg clutches has occurred {{over the last few}} decades. By analysing extensive historical nest records dating back five decades I verified the occurrence of this increase in three-egg clutches over many of the sites within their breeding range. As African Black Oystercatchers are very territorial, co-operative polygyny was rejected as a sole cause (through observations). As eggs were found to be significantly similar (through intra-clutch egg shape comparisons) within clutches egg-dumping as a cause was also rejected. It was thus established that the increase in three-egg clutch frequency was indicating an increase in breeding effort. On further analysis of this increase, it was discovered that three-egg clutches offer no benefit to species fitness or breeding success as they do not result in an increased fledgling output to those of the smaller two-egg clutches. This is primarily due to inefficient incubation {{as a result of the}} <b>extra</b> <b>egg,</b> and the inability to maintain and feed a larger brood size.

40|$|In the {{organization}} and management of poultry farming many problems arise which call for a solution. Among such problems are the following: The amount of floor space per hen which will prove the most economical, the value of electric lights in poultry houses, amount of labor which can be profitably invested in a poultry flock, {{and the amount of}} feed which can be economically fed to poultry. There are many influences which determine poultry profits that cannot be controlled directly, but the factors mentioned here are largely within the control of the poultryman. He should, therefore, direct them as far as possible so as to increase his net returns. Each hen should be provided with floor space necessary for most efficient production. The poultryman, however, does not know the amount of space that will bring the greatest returns. If the net income from each hen is just as high with two square feet of floor space per hen as where each hen has six square feet, then it is not economical to have six square feet of floor space per hen. If this is the case, it would be advisable for the poultryman to increase the size of his flock so as to obtain the fullest returns from his investment in poultry houses and equipment. A poultry farmer should know if there are any advantages derived from the use of electric lights. If it is an advantage to use lights, the poultryman desires to know how many hours they should be used each day. If, through the use of lights, production is increased {{to such an extent that}} gross returns more than pay for wiring, cost of electricity, and other incidental expenses, lights will prove a profitable investment. A poultryman must give time and labor to his flock in feeding, cleaning coops and gathering eggs. When this work has been efficiently done, extra time and labor is not likely to increase profits. The poultry farmer wants to know the point where increased labor fails to increase profits. This same principle applies to the amount of feed given to poultry. Up to a certain point production may be increased as the amount of feed is increased, but before this point is reached, the <b>extra</b> <b>eggs</b> may not pay for the additional feed costs.
