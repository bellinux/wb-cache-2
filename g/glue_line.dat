40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{investigates the}} effects of {{alkaline}} copper quaternary (ACQ) preservative treatment and of plywood <b>glue</b> <b>lines</b> on resistance-based moisture content (MC) measurements. Moisture meter readings using stainless steel screws as electrodes were acquired over a range of moisture conditions in Southern Yellow Pine (SYP) lumber and plywood. Calibration equations are presented for predicting gravimetric MC from meter readings taken in SYP lumber and SYP plywood with or without ACQ treatment. These corrections assume that the meter has been set for SYP. Correlation equations are also presented for directly relating resistance to gravimetric MC, which may be useful for automated data collection systems employed in monitoring moisture levels in buildings. The conductance of SYP lumber was raised by treatment with ACQ, particularly at higher moisture contents, but was unaffected by vacuum-pressure treatment with water. The conductance of untreated SYP plywood, measured with electrodes penetrating the <b>glue</b> <b>lines,</b> exceeded that of untreated SYP lumber. The conductance of SYP plywood was lowered by treatment with ACQ, by vacuum-pressure soaking with water, and by exposure to rain. We suggest that electrolytes in the plywood <b>glue</b> <b>lines</b> increase the conductance of untreated plywood relative to that of untreated lumber, and that the concentration of these electrolytes is lowered by the (aqueous) preservative treatment process, thereby lowering the conductance of these high-conductance pathways...|$|R

Traditionally postform countertops were manufactured with a solvent-based contact cement (a highly flammable, volatile organic compound - VOC).

5000|$|Traditional {{edge banding}} was a manual process {{requiring}} ordinary carpentry tools and materials. In modern applications, particularly for high-volume, repetitive manufacturing steps such as cabinet doors, edge banding {{is applied to}} the substrate by an automated process using a hot-melt adhesive. Hot melt adhesives can be water or solvent based and may consist of various raw materials including EVA, PUR, PA, APOA, and PO. A substrate primer may also be used as a bonding agent between the adhesive and the substrate. Thicker edge bandings typically require a slight concavity to provide a tight <b>glue</b> <b>line.</b> The thickness can vary from [...]018" [...] to 5mm or even more. The machine that applies the edge banding is called edgebander. An edgebander bonds the edge banding to the substrate, trims the leading and trailing edges, trims top and bottom flush with the substrate, scraps any surplus, and buffs the finished edge.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Internal hernias occur {{frequently}} after laparoscopic gastric bypass. We {{have found}} no data on the relative strength of the various techniques available for closing these defects. The present study was performed to obtain such data to form a theoretical basis for clinical studies. METHODS: Six piglets were operated laparoscopically and four loops of small bowel created in each. These mesenteric gaps were closed over a distance of 40 mm using (1) running 2 - 0 Ethibond® suture, (2) Endo Hernia stapler, (3) fibrin glue (Tisseel®) and (4) controls, where the mesenteric surfaces were rubbed with a sponge and approximated without further intervention. After 6 weeks, the different segments of the mesentery were excised. The tensile strength was measured using continuously increased traction until the closure ruptured. The ordinary mesentery served as the control. The breaking tension and total amount of energy transferred to the tissue were registered. RESULTS: Control areas with rubbed areas developed no adhesions. Suture and staple lines contracted by 30 % in length, whereas the fibrin <b>glued</b> <b>lines</b> were even shorter. Median tensile strength was greatest for the sutured lines (14, 293 mN) and stapled lines (10, 798 mN). Fibrin <b>glued</b> <b>lines</b> were significantly weaker (6, 780 mN, p = 0. 013 and p = 0. 026), but as strong as ordinary mesentery (4, 165 mN). CONCLUSIONS: If ongoing controlled randomized trials show closure to be beneficial, further studies should include staples {{as one of the}} options for the closure of mesenteric defects.

At first, LVL panels were manufactured with nine layers of wood veneer glued with phenol-formaldehyde resin. After, they were reinforced with fiberglass impregnated with epoxy or isophthalic resin or with isophthalic resin. The treatments consisted on the aplication of one, two and four reinforced layers.

Thus, the bamboo stems were treated by immersion method with chemical product (solution of 1 % of active ingredients of copper chrome borate - CCB) and water by 15 days. Before treating the stems, the external and internal parts were removed to obtain the flat strips of bamboo with 4 mm of thickness, 45 cm of length and 5 cm of width. The "Cascophen RS" (resorcinol-formaldehyde) and "Cascorez-extra" (polyvinyl acetate) commercial adhesives were used to bond the flat strips.
