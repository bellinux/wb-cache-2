50|$|An <b>intertrigo</b> usually {{develops}} {{from the}} chafing of warm, moist {{skin in the}} areas of the inner thighs and genitalia, the armpits, under the breasts, the underside of the belly, behind the ears, and the web spaces between the toes and fingers. An <b>intertrigo</b> usually appears red and raw-looking, and may also itch, ooze, and be sore. Intertrigos occur more often among overweight individuals, those with diabetes, those restricted to bed rest or diaper use, and those who use medical devices, like artificial limbs, that trap moisture against the skin. Also, there are several skin diseases that can cause an <b>intertrigo</b> to develop, such as dermatitis or inverse psoriasis.|$|E

40|$|Introduction <b>Intertrigo</b> is an {{inflammatory}} condition of skin folds, induced by skin-to-skin contact, heat, moisture and friction. When skin erosions occur, bacteria and fungi {{of the skin}} flora can easy maintain <b>intertrigo.</b> <b>Intertrigo</b> is a chronic problem for especially patients in need of special care. There are multiple preventive measurements and treatments, however without evidence for the best possible treatment. MediHoneyTM barrier cream, is a cream based on honey. Honey has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties and {{has been used for}} centuries to heal wounds. Based on the properties of honey, MediHoneyTM barrier cream could be a good alternative in the treatment of <b>intertrigo,</b> with a high patient and user comfort. Material and method In this multicentre, randomized, left-right intervention study, patients with symmetrical <b>intertrigo</b> in large skin folds were included. The study compared the standard therapy with zinc oxide ointment and MediHoneyTM barrier cream. During the study of 3 weeks, patients were treated symmetrical, left and right, and the severity of <b>intertrigo</b> was scored at day 1, 7, 14 and 21. Results In this study 31 patients with symmetrical <b>intertrigo</b> were included. The results showed that both zinc oxide ointment and MediHoneyTM barrier cream were effective in the treatment of <b>intertrigo,</b> both lower the severity of <b>intertrigo</b> in time. MediHoneyTM barrier cream showed significant lower complaints of itching. There was no prove, the barrier cream was more effective than the standard. The nursing staff finds the barrier cream easier to apply and preferred MediHoneyTM barrier cream over zinc oxide ointment. Discussion and conclusion The {{results of this study suggest}} that MediHoneyTM barrier cream is a good alternative in the treatment of <b>intertrigo,</b> with good user comfort. It suggests that the use of MediHoneyTM barrier cream causes less itching complaints. However, the study population is low, so the results should be interpreted with caution. In the follow-up study, the effect of MediHoneyTM barrier cream should be investigated further. To investigate whether MediHoneyTM barrier cream is more effective, based on the properties of honey, will be investigated with microbiologic research. ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Intertrigo</b> is an {{inflammatory}} dermatosis {{of the skin}} folds of the body, for which a large variety of topical medications may be recommended. A systematic literature review was performed to find scientific evidence for preventing and treating <b>intertrigo</b> within the nursing domain.

The aim was to identify all publications that concerned <b>intertrigo</b> itself and other conditions that were related to intertriginous regions. This search produced 451 references. A final set of 24 studies was retained and analyzed on content and methodologic quality. Most studies concerned treatments with antifungals or disinfectants in heterogeneous research samples, with only small subsamples of people with <b>intertrigo.</b> Six studies were randomized controlled trials.

40|$|Gram-negative {{infection}} of the toe web space is less frequent than dermatophytes and yeasts, {{but it is more}} challenging, especially with the involvement of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in relation to antibiotic resistance and the increased risk of potentially lethal complications. Many conditions, other than infections, might initially present with the same clinical features, recognising the common initial damage (<b>intertrigo),</b> due to skin-on-skin rubbing in a moist environment with air entrapment, which is typical of interdigital spaces. Conditions such as contact eczema, atopic dermatitis, and inverse psoriasis, frequently predispose to, and are maintained by, the <b>intertrigo,</b> triggering a vicious circle. The dermatologist is in a lead position to address the correct assessment and management. A careful screening for predisposing factors is necessary: overweight, diabetic, but also athletes or people attending swimming pools, gyms, public showers/dressing rooms, and thermal baths are also at an increased risk of <b>intertrigo</b> of the toe web spaces. Occupational activities other than recreational might be relevant, {{such as the use of}} safety shoes or working in wet warm conditions.

40|$|Background: Itchy {{maceration}} of the toe webs {{is common}} in warm and humid weather. Some cases {{do not respond to}} treatment for tinea or eczema. Methods: Patients with foot <b>intertrigo</b> with a poor response to antifungal or antiinflammatorytreatment from 2004 to 2009 were included in this study. Theirgeneral characteristics were recorded. Bacterial and fungal cultures as wellas potassium hydroxide preparations were performed. Results: We recorded 32 episodes of foot bacterial <b>intertrigo</b> in 17 patients. The diseasewas more common in men (82 %) and {{the mean age of the}} patients was 59 years. The main clinical finding was maceration of the toe webs. Themajority of bacterial cultures grew mixed pathogens (93 %).

40|$|Background. Foot <b>intertrigo</b> {{is mostly}} caused by {{dermatophytes}} and yeasts, less frequently by grampositive and gram-negative bacteria. Nevertheless, {{the importance of}} polymicrobial infections and especially colonizations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cause therapy problems in relation to antibiotic resistance {{and the risk of}} potentially lethal complications. Objective: The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the main epidemiologic and clinical features of <b>intertrigo</b> from gram-negative bacteria, the function of promoting factors, and the measures taken to treat and prevent this disorder. Methods: Between 1989 and 1998, 123 cases of <b>intertrigo</b> from gram-negative bacteria were observed at the Cagliari University Dermatology Department. Routine clinical and blood examinations, repeated bacterioscopic and mycologic examinations, cultures aimed at identifying the responsible bacteria, and antibiograms were performed. Results. P aeruginosa was found to be the prevailing pathogen, both alone and associated with other gram-negative bacteria (such as Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii) and grampositive bacteria. Clinical manifestations were similar in the majority of patients: erythema, vesicopostules, erosions, and marked maceration caused by abundant, malodorous exudate, Lesions affected the interdigital spaces of both feet and frequently extended to the planta and the back of the toes. Patients complained of burning and pain. Successful therapies were achieved with combined topical and systemic treatment; to avoid the risk of antimicrobial resistance, the choice of the active antibiotic was guided by antibiograms. Conclusion: In all symptomatic toe web infections, the presence of gram-negative germs, such as P aeruginosa, should be investigated to avoid the risk of treatment failures and more severe local or systemic complications...|$|E
