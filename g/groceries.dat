But, when Jimmy tries to spy on him through a window, the Creeper sneaks up on Jimmy and kills him. Meanwhile, at the police station, Captain M.J.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objectives}} {{of this paper}} are to provide an in-depth examination of consumers’ purchase behaviour, motives and perceptions of <b>grocery</b> shopping alternatives and to explore the meaning of ‘convenience’ among <b>grocery</b> shoppers. Methods: Four 90 minute semi-structured, face to face triads (groups of three) were conducted among household <b>grocery</b> shoppers, reflecting different ages, family types and social classes. Three triads were conducted with women and one with men in the South East of England. Findings: the contingent and situational approach to <b>grocery</b> shopping found in earlier studies is intensified by the increased availability of <b>grocery</b> channels, particularly the ‘branded’ local convenience stores. The diverse convenience benefits offered by each channel {{is central to the}} choice of where and when to <b>grocery</b> shop, whether for a ‘main’ <b>grocery</b> shop or a ‘top-up’ shop. No single <b>grocery</b> channel seems to fulfil all convenience and shopping requirements. Conclusions and recommendations: For <b>grocery</b> shoppers, ‘convenience’ is sought by pursuing the optimal combination of online, ‘branded’ convenience stores and supermarket shopping. Hence <b>grocery</b> shopping can be defined as a truly multi-channel experience. The implication of these findings for <b>grocery</b> retailers is that the integration of their multi-channel strategies must focus on providing and reinforcing appropriate forms of consumer convenience in each channel...|$|R

5|$|Gjirokastër is principally a {{commercial}} center with some industries, notably {{the production of}} foodstuffs, leather, and textiles.

5|$|Spalding {{had been}} a port from before any of the river {{improvements}} were made. The townspeople had refused to repair the river {{during the reign of}} Henry III, as they claimed {{it was part of the}} sea here. Its importance as a port increased with the river improvements and the Stamford Canal, and although it did not have a customs house, by 1695 it had various officials who acted as customs officers for goods arriving at the quays and warehouses. Exports included oats, coleseed, rape oil, hides and wool, with a much greater variety of imports, including stone, timber, coal, <b>groceries,</b> glass and beeswax. More exotic imports included French and Spanish wines, and some of the first imports of tea, coffee and chocolate.|$|E

The tolls brought in an income which remained below £9,000 until 1823, but then rose steadily to reach £13,079 in 1841. Traffic towards Grantham included coal and coke, lime, <b>groceries</b> and building materials. Some of it supplied villages {{along the line of}} the canal, and some of that which travelled the full distance was distributed by land to villages beyond Grantham. Downward traffic was largely agricultural produce, including corn, beans, malt and wool. Such produce was normally loaded at Grantham or Harby.|$|E

The original harbour was constructed and maintained by the abbot within the terms of an agreement between the burgesses and John Gedy, the abbot in 1394 AD. This {{gave way to a}} more commodious port in 1725, which in turn was enlarged and improved in 1839, when the sea wall, quay walls and breakwater were added to the old inner harbour, at a cost of £58,000. Arbroath became a major port for the coastal shipping trade and in 1846, there were 89 Arbroath registered vessels, totalling 9,100 gross tons. In the same year, 599 vessels docked at Arbroath, 56 from foreign ports (mainly Baltic ports) with the remaining 543 employed on the coastal trade.
