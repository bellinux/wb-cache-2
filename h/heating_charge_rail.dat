40|$|AbstractTo {{investigate}} {{the mechanism of}} heat and moisture transfer in soil <b>heat</b> <b>charging</b> for solar-soil source heat pump system, a testing rig of one-dimension soil <b>heat</b> <b>charging</b> is constructed. Two different soils, sand and loam, are used for the testing. The soil temperature distribution and volumetric water content (VWC) variations are studied under different heat source temperature and soil initial VWC, {{and the difference between}} these two soils is analysed as well. The coupled and mutual effect of heat and moisture transfer is discussed. The study shows that sand is better than loam in soil <b>heat</b> <b>charging.</b> The <b>heat</b> source temperature has an obvious impact on soil VWC distribution. Higher heat source temperature leads to higher peak VWC. The initial VWC has a slight impact on soil temperature distribution...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{possibilities of}} controlling temperature field distribution in inductively <b>heated</b> <b>charge.</b> The change of its distribution was obtained using the sequential one-, two-, and three-frequency heating.

For the analysis, a professional calculation software package utilizing the finite element method, Flux 3 D, was used. The problem of obtaining an appropriate temperature distribution in the <b>heated</b> <b>charge</b> of a complex shape {{is very important in}} many practical applications. A typical example is hardening of gear wheels. For such an application, it is necessary to obtain (on the surface and at a desired depth) an uniform temperature distribution on the tooth face, top land and bottom land of the gear. The obtained temperature should have proper distribution and value. Such a distribution is very difficult to achieve...|$|R
