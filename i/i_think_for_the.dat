500|$|They said, [...] "Victoria Principal {{could be}} set to make a shock return to legendary drama series Dallas after stars Patrick Duffy and Jesse Metcalfe let slip {{producers}} want her in the show's upcoming reboot. The actress' character, Pamela Ewing, was written out of the series in 1987, when viewers were told she had only months to live after fleeing the Texan dynasty." [...] In an added piece, they said: [...] "But the storyline was left open-ended, and it's now emerged Principal – who is the only surviving member of the show's original cast not {{signed up for the}} relaunch later this year – could be brought back to Dallas in an explosive plot." [...] Jesse Metcalfe said, [...] "She hasn't (come back) – she hasn't as yet. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> producers of the show, it's an open invitation." ...|$|E
500|$|Pamela's {{marriage}} to Bobby Ewing {{is central to}} understanding her character. The couple produced the opening scene of Dallas when the show first aired in 1978, with Bobby bringing his new bride home to meet Jock and Miss Ellie Ewing. [...] Their complex relationship has often been {{compared to that of}} Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. When asked about whether or not series creator David Jacobs had this parallel relationship in mind from the start, he said: [...] "Yes, guilty (laughs)". Relations can be made from William Shakespeare's two feuding families in Romeo and Juliet, the Montagues and the Capulets. These families represent the Barnes and the Ewing feuding families, with Pamela being portrayed as Juliet Capulet and Bobby as Romeo Montague. According to Patrick Duffy, being immediately paired off with Principal was a challenge. He said, [...] "We were {{in a constant state of}} competition. We were very territorial in front of the camera, and it was a strain." [...] However, their off-screen relationship significantly improved in the show's third season, with Duffy explaining: [...] "I developed an appreciation for her, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time she started to trust me. Some of the best scenes on the show were between Victoria and me, and they happened after we got comfortable with each other." ...|$|E
500|$|In June, a {{group of}} 132 {{supporters}} of Paul, demanding the freedom as delegates to the upcoming Republican party national convention to cast votes for Paul, filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court against the Republican National Committee and 55 state and territorial Republican party organizations for allegedly coercing delegates to choose Mitt Romney as the party’s presidential nominee. The suit alleged {{that there had been}} “a systematic campaign of election fraud at state conventions,” employing rigging of voting machines, ballot stuffing, and falsification of ballot totals. The suit further pointed to incidents at state conventions, including acts of violence and changes in procedural rules, allegedly intended to deny participation of Paul supporters in the party decision-making and to prevent votes from being cast for Paul. An attorney representing the complainants said that Paul campaign advisor Doug Wead had voiced support for the legal action. Paul himself told CNN that although the lawsuit was not a part of his campaign’s strategy and that he had not been advising his supporters to sue, {{he was not going to}} tell his supporters not to sue, if they had a legitimate argument. “If they’re not following the rules, you have a right to stand up for the rules. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> most part these winning caucuses that we've been involved in we have followed the rules. And the other side has at times not followed the rules.” ...|$|E

Gray Davis, Vin Scully, John Wooden, and Jack Nicholson. [...] In addition to 400 present at St. Martin, the funeral was simulcast to 19,000 fans at Staples Center and broadcast on Los Angeles television stations. [...] In his eulogy, Cardinal Mahony told mourners: [...] "I am going to go outside and look up in the sky, because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> last time we will see the meteor go by, and we will wave so long.
