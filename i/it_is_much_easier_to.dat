5|$|Downhill <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> topple {{over the}} front wheel because the incline moves the line of mg closer to f. To try to reduce this {{tendency}} the rider can stand back on the pedals {{to try to keep}} m as far back as possible.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{conceptual}} clarity of this Feynman approach to QED, almost no early textbooks follow {{him in their}} presentation. When performing calculations <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> work with the Fourier transforms of the propagators. Experimental tests of quantum electrodynamics are typically scattering experiments. In scattering theory, particles' momenta rather than their positions are considered, and it is convenient to think of particles as being created or annihilated when they interact. Feynman diagrams then look the same, but the lines have different interpretations. The electron line represents an electron with a given energy and momentum, with a similar interpretation of the photon line. A vertex diagram represents the annihilation of one electron {{and the creation of}} another together with the absorption or creation of a photon, each having specified energies and momenta.|$|E

5|$|The {{mechanical}} properties {{of iron and}} its alloys can be evaluated {{using a variety of}} tests, including the Brinell test, Rockwell test and the Vickers hardness test. The data on iron is so consistent that it is often used to calibrate measurements or to compare tests. However, the {{mechanical properties}} of iron are significantly affected by the sample's purity: pure, single crystals of iron are actually softer than aluminium, and the purest industrially produced iron (99.99%) has a hardness of 20–30Brinell. An increase in the carbon content will cause {{a significant increase in the}} hardness and tensile strength of iron. Maximum hardness of 65 Rc is achieved with a 0.6% carbon content, although the alloy has low tensile strength. Because of the softness of iron, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> work with than its heavier congeners ruthenium and osmium.|$|E
25|$|Although Newton's {{theory has}} been superseded, most modern non-relativistic {{gravitational}} calculations still use it because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> work with and is sufficiently accurate for most applications.|$|E

25|$|Although {{it is true}} that {{analyzing}} {{what has}} been learned by an artificial neural network is difficult, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> do so than to analyze what has been learned by a biological neural network. Furthermore, researchers involved in exploring learning algorithms for neural networks are gradually uncovering general principles that allow a learning machine to be successful. For example, local vs non-local learning and shallow vs deep architecture.|$|E

25|$|It {{is common}} for Hong Kong people to learn {{traditional}} Chinese characters in school, and some simplified Chinese in passing (either through reading mainland-published books or other media). For use on computers, however, people tend to type Chinese characters using a traditional character set such as Big5. In Hong Kong, as well as elsewhere, it {{is common for}} people who use both sets to do so because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> convert from the traditional character set to the simplified character set because of the usage of the aforementioned methods 8 and 9 of simplification.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} a number of {{techniques}} for unassisted righting and re-entry of a kayak after a capsize and turtling, most paddlers consider it safest to paddle with one or more others, as assistance is useful if attempting to recover via rolling solo fails. Even if the assistance fails to successfully right the kayaker, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> climb back into a boat in the open sea if one has another boat and paddler to help and the swamped boat has been emptied of water first. Nonetheless, experienced paddlers do attempt open-water crossings unaccompanied, and many major long-distance kayak expeditions have been carried out solo.|$|E
25|$|In Hinduism, an icon, image, statue or idol {{is called}} Murti or Pratima. Major Hindu traditions such as Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism and Smartaism favor {{the use of}} Murti (idol). These traditions {{suggest that it is}} easier to {{dedicate}} time and focus on spirituality through anthropomorphic or non-anthropomorphic icons. The Bhagavad Gita – a Hindu scripture, in verse 12.5, states that only a few have the time and mind to ponder and fix on the unmanifested Absolute (abstract formless Brahman), and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> focus on qualities, virtues, aspects of a manifested representation of god, through one's senses, emotions and heart, because the way human beings naturally are.|$|E

25|$|At {{least nine}} Mexican and Colombian drug cartels have {{established}} bases in 11 West African nations. They are reportedly {{working closely with}} local criminal gangs {{to carve out a}} staging area for access to the lucrative European market. The Colombian and Mexican cartels have discovered that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> smuggle large loads into West Africa and then break that up into smaller shipments to Europe – mostly Spain, the United Kingdom and France. Higher demand for cocaine in Western Europe in addition to North American interdiction campaigns has led to dramatically increased trafficking in the region: nearly 50% of all non-U.S. bound cocaine, or about 13% of all global flows, is now smuggled through West Africa.|$|E
25|$|The {{ideal self}} and real self involve {{understanding}} {{the issues that}} arise from having {{an idea of what}} you wish you were as a person, and having that not match with who you actually are as a person (incongruence). The ideal self is what a person believes should be done, as well as what their core values are. The real self is what is actually played out in life. Through humanistic therapy, an understanding of the present allows clients to add positive experiences to their real self-concept. The goal is to have the two concepts of self become congruent. Rogers believed that only when a therapist was able to be congruent, a real relationship occurs in therapy. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> trust someone who is willing to share feelings openly, even if it may not be what the client always wants; this allows the therapist to foster a strong relationship.|$|E
500|$|A {{recurring}} theme throughout Ethical Oil: The Case for Canada's Oil Sands is the perceived hypocrisy of Western environmental movements. In a chapter entitled [...] "Greenpeace's Best Fundraiser Ever", Levant notes the disparities between the harsh {{criticism of the}} Canadian energy industry coming from Greenpeace Canada to the seemingly absent criticism of Chinese industrial activity (such as nuclear power) from Greenpeace China, arguing that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> criticize free and liberal democracies than to criticize controlling regimes, but also raising the question of funding, noting that China, the most populated country on Earth, is a very attractive fundraising market for Greenpeace (which Levant describes as a 'multinational corporation').|$|E

500|$|Cooper's meticulous {{planning}} {{may also}} have extended to the timing of his operation, and even his choice of attire, according to Kaye's research team. [...] "The FBI searched but couldn't find anyone who disappeared that weekend," [...] Kaye wrote, suggesting that the perpetrator may have returned to his normal occupation. [...] "If you were planning on going 'back to work on Monday', then you would need {{as much time as}} possible {{to get out of the}} woods, find transportation and get home.
