5|$|Morris {{ended the}} {{first-class}} tour with 1,922 runs at 71.18, despite being troubled by a {{split between the}} first and second <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> left hand caused by constant jarring from the bat as he played the ball. The wound often opened while he was batting, forcing him to undergo a minor operation, which sidelined him from some matches in the latter part of the tour.|$|E
5|$|Frank was autopsied twice, {{the second}} time to recover debris {{embedded}} in his body. The autopsy revealed that his lower extremities had been ripped off; his muscle tissue was extensively mutilated and torn; small pieces of wire, brass, and miscellaneous articles including a hat ornament were imbedded in various limbs; the <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> right hand were fractured and the bones splintered; and the distal phalanx of each finger on his left hand were missing. The coroner also observed numerous patches of blackened areas, similar to close-range gunshot residue. Four human finger bones were discovered among the wreckage at the primary crash site.|$|E
5|$|Morris {{ended the}} {{first-class}} matches with 1,922 runs at 71.18 including seven centuries, ranking him second in runs only to Bradman (2,428 at 89.92) and substantially ahead of third-placed Hassett (1,563 at 74.42). He did so despite being troubled by a {{split between the}} first and second <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> left hand, caused by constant jarring from the bat as he played the ball. The wound often opened while he was batting, forcing him to undergo a minor operation which sidelined him from some matches in the latter part of the tour.|$|E
60|$|He {{remained}} {{calm and}} silent, {{with his eyes}} fixed on the ground, and the tip <b>of</b> every <b>finger</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> right hand delicately poised against the tip <b>of</b> every <b>finger</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> left.|$|R
60|$|Five {{minutes later}} he came out, sucking the first <b>finger</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> left hand.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, he {{had surgery}} {{to fix the}} tendon <b>of</b> the middle <b>finger</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> right hand.|$|R
25|$|In 1907, {{he gained}} some fame for an {{incident}} aboard the USS Connecticut during a target practice exercise. Believing an explosion imminent within the breechblock {{of one of}} the ship's guns, Cronan shoved his hand within the block to prevent its closing. He prevented any explosion and lost two <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> right hand in the process.|$|E
25|$|It is {{difficult}} to disguise the flipper entirely when bowling, as the hand action is distinctly different from a leg break. When Clarrie Grimmett first began bowling the delivery, batsmen would listen for the telltale clicking sound of his fingers; to compensate, Grimmett would often click the <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> non-bowling hand when not bowling the flipper to confuse the batsman.|$|E
25|$|In 1659, Aurangzeb {{sent his}} trusted general and {{maternal}} uncle Shaista Khan, the Wali in Golconda to recover forts {{lost to the}} Maratha rebels. Shaista Khan drove into Maratha territory and took up residence in Pune. But in a daring raid on the governor's palace in Pune during a midnight wedding celebration, the Marathas killed Shaista Khan's son and maimed Shaista Khan by cutting off the <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand. Shaista Khan, however, survived and was re-appointed the administrator of Bengal going {{on to become a}} key commander in the war against the Ahoms.|$|E

25|$|Confession {{does not}} {{take place in a}} confessional, but {{normally}} in {{the main part of the}} church itself, usually before an analogion (lectern) set up near the iconostasion. On the analogion is placed a Gospel Book and a blessing cross. The confession often takes place before an icon of Jesus Christ. Orthodox understand that the confession is not made to the priest, but to Christ, and the priest stands only as witness and guide. Before confessing, the penitent venerates the Gospel Book and cross, and places the thumb and first two <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> right hand on the feet of Christ as he is depicted on the cross. The confessor will often read an admonition warning the penitent to make a full confession, holding nothing back.|$|E
25|$|The {{others can}} be {{standing}} or sitting. With the exception of Yakushi Nyorai, all statues are empty-handed and their fingers make a mudra. To the contrary, Yakushi Nyorai's right hand always holds some object, either a sphere or a small jar, while the other makes a mudra. Dainichi Nyorai's hands make a characteristic mudra (the <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> left hand hold his right hand's index, see photo). Excepted Dainichi Nyorai, who is represented with some body ornamentation like a bodhisattva, all statues wear just a simple robe without body ornamentation, signs of priesthood. This is because they represent someone who has reached enlightenment. The robe can cover one or both shoulders. The head has a round protuberance on top with the hair divided in tight curls. Both features are exclusive characteristics of this rank, but the curls can be missing.|$|E
25|$|Before he had {{a chance}} to start with the band, however, he nearly lost his life when the caravan he and his wife lived in caught fire when he knocked over a candle on his way to bed. His wife made {{artificial}} flowers from extremely flammable celluloid. They caught fire, engulfing the wagon in flames almost immediately. Reinhardt dragged himself and his wife through the fire to safety, but suffered extensive burns on his left hand and other areas. He received first- and second-degree burns over half his body. His right leg was paralyzed, and the fourth and fifth <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> left hand were badly burned. Doctors believed that he would never play guitar again, and they intended to amputate one of his legs. Reinhardt refused to have the surgery and left the hospital after a short time; he was able to walk within a year with the aid of a cane.|$|E
60|$|He had a quiet toneless {{voice and}} urbane manners {{and on a}} <b>finger</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> plump clean hand he {{displayed}} at moments a signet ring.|$|R

25|$|After some narrow {{escapes from}} the Allies in the {{immediate}} aftermath of World War II, Brunner fled West Germany in 1954, first for Egypt, then Syria, where he remained until his death. He was the object of many manhunts and investigations over the years by different groups, including the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the Klarsfelds and others. He was condemned to death in absentia in France in 1954 for crimes against humanity. He lost an eye and then the <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> left hand as a result of letter bombs sent to him in 1961 and 1980, possibly by the Israeli Mossad. The government of Syria under Hafez el-Assad came close to extraditing him to East Germany, before this plan was halted by the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989. Brunner survived all the attempts to detain him, unrepentant about his activities to the end. During his long residence in Syria, Brunner was reportedly granted asylum, a generous salary and protection by the ruling Ba'ath Party in exchange for his advice on effective torture and interrogation techniques used by the Germans in World War II.|$|E
500|$|A {{reference}} work by Hal Leonard compares it to a pianist's approach, with Hendrix's [...] "thumb fret the bass notes, functioning in {{almost the same}} manner as a keyboardist's left hand, and the <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fretting hand can be likened to a pianist's right hand". [...] Leonard also adds that guitarist Adrian Belew describes the technique as a [...] "lost art".|$|E
500|$|During {{his next}} start on July 14 against the Braves, Richard was {{pitching}} well and even struck {{out the side}} in the second inning, but had trouble seeing catcher Alan Ashby's signs and also had difficulty moving his arm. He left {{the game in the}} fourth inning after throwing a fastball and feeling his right arm go [...] "dead". He had numbness in the <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> right hand and could not grasp a baseball. The Astros placed Richard on the 21-day disabled list. As it turned out, it would be his last major league game.|$|E

50|$|Zempilas {{suffered}} another {{serious injury}} in 1991, he snapped finger tendons {{on the middle}} <b>finger</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> left hand in a pre-season match and wasn’t able {{to play for the}} rest of the year.|$|R
500|$|The split-second {{incident}} {{only allowed}} Banks {{time for one}} conscious thought – that the shot was impossible to catch, {{and the only way}} to prevent Pelé from following up on the rebound would be to parry the ball over the bar. The ball bounced two yards in front of the goal-line, and Banks managed to make contact with the ball with the <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> right hand, and rolled his hand slightly to angle to ball over the crossbar. He landed in the inner netting of the goal, and knew he had saved the ball after witnessing Pelé's reaction. Banks then rose to his feet to defend the corner, and broke into laughter after the following exchange: ...|$|E
500|$|While {{playing with}} Providence in 1883, Irwin broke {{the third and}} fourth <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> left hand. Not wanting to miss any games, he {{obtained}} an oversized buckskin driving glove, padded it and sewed {{the third and fourth}} fingers together to allow space for bandages. He used the glove even after his fingers healed. John Montgomery Ward of New York soon took the field with a similar glove. By the following season, almost every professional player was using the [...] "Irwin glove." [...] Prior to 1884, use of gloves was limited to first basemen and catchers. In 1882, Irwin committed a league-high 78 errors in 84 games. He committed 66 errors in 98 games the following year. Over his next two seasons with the glove, Irwin committed 98 errors in 163 games.|$|E
2500|$|Dick Brittenden said of Robertson: [...] "He {{spun the}} ball either way a prodigious amount ... Small and slender, he {{suffered}} much ill-health, and asthma ended a brilliant career cruelly early." [...] An accident {{in his youth}} had resulted {{in the loss of}} two <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> left hand.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2006 he was {{recalled}} to the Test {{side for}} the series against India, only to be dropped from the squad before the first Test. He held the ball with two <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> left hand (thumb, and the index finger). [...] He announced his retirement from professional cricket on 2 October 2008, {{more than four years}} after his last Test match and five years after his last ODI.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{stranger}} to mountain folk was Sheffey’s insistence on cleanliness. [...] If his towels or bedding were dirty, {{he would let}} his host know. He might even ask his hostess for a white counterpane. He would pour {{a small amount of}} coffee into his saucer, wash the edges where the <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hostess had touched it, and then throw the liquid out the door or into the fire. [...] He assured his son that “plenty of water inside and out” was the “best thing for anybody.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Gustavus is {{reported}} to have entered battle without wearing any armor, proclaiming, [...] "The Lord God is my armor!" [...] It is more likely that he simply wore a leather cuirass rather than going into battle wearing no battle protection whatsoever. In 1627, near Dirschau in Prussia, a Polish soldier shot him in the muscles above his shoulders. He survived, but the doctors could not remove the bullet, so from that point on, he could not wear iron armor; two <b>fingers</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> right hand were paralyzed.|$|E
2500|$|Bassist James Jamerson often {{played his}} {{instrument}} {{with only the}} index <b>finger</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> right hand, and created many of the basslines apparent on Motown songs such as [...] "Up the Ladder to the Roof" [...] by The Supremes.|$|R
