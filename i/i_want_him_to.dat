In March, Winehouse was quoted in a magazine as saying, [...] "I still love Blake and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> move into my new house with me—that was my plan all along ...

500|$|Doctors {{were able}} to catch the disease early on before it spread, unlike the case of {{baseball}} and American football player Bo Jackson. As a result, in April, doctors announced an extremely successful surgery. Jackson spoke out about Emery, speculating {{that they were the}} only two athletes to come back after the disease. Jackson added, [...] "I take my hat off [...] <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> know I am in his corner. It's a lot of hard work. To come back and play, it takes a very, very special and driven person. He's got a different makeup to want to do all the little things he needs to compete on a professional level." [...] Unlike Jackson, who required numerous hip replacements, Emery had the benefit of advancements in modern medicine, undergoing a very specialized and complex procedure that involved removing 13 centimetres from his right fibula, and then grafting it to the femur to re-introduce a proper blood supply to the area. Holmgren said that while the surgery went better than expected, he did not know exactly how long Emery's recovery would take.|$|E

In an {{interview}} with Pitchfork Media, Allen stated that the song's lyrics describe her younger brother, Alfie Allen. She further explained:When I wrote [...] "Alfie", nobody really knew who I was. At first he was really upset about it, because he thought that I was just pointing out all of his bad points and attacking him. I thought it was really flattering [...] I thought he'd be really, really happy because it proved to him how much I loved him, that I care about him, and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do something with his life.

500|$|... "You Are Not Alone" [...] is a R ballad {{about love}} and isolation. The song was written by R. Kelly and {{produced}} by Kelly and Jackson. Kelly wrote the song after losing close people in his life. Kelly was delighted {{to be able to}} work with his idol, explaining [...] "I was psyched... I feel I could have done his whole album. Not being selfish. I was just that geeked about it. It was an experience out of this world... It's amazing to know that five years ago I was writing songs in a basement in the ghetto and now I'm writing for Michael Jackson... I'd be a fool not to say it's a dream come true." [...] Jackson contacted Kelly to see if he had any material available. Kelly forwarded a tape recording of the song and Jackson then agreed to work with Kelly on the piece. On the tape sent to Jackson, Kelly sung [...] "You Are Not Alone" [...] mimicking Jackson's vocal style, explaining, [...] "I think I am him. I become him. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> feel that as well." [...] Jackson found the interpretation amusing. They spent the last week of November 1994 together in the studio working on the track.|$|E
500|$|After making three {{separate}} returns in September 2013, September 2014 {{and another in}} February 2015 to commemorate 30 years of EastEnders in EastEnders Live Week, Windsor made an unannounced return to EastEnders in 2016, appearing in the episode broadcast on 15 January. After this, {{it was announced that}} the character was to be killed off, losing her battle with breast cancer. The scenes were filmed in secret in November 2015, following Windsor's personal decision for Peggy to be killed. She said: [...] "Peggy is a character close to my heart but I made the decision a while ago that I need to say goodbye to Peggy once and for all as otherwise she will always be there, urging me to go back and that is something I need to shut the door on. After thinking long and hard about it, I realised that it is time for me and the audience to say our final farewells to the lady who I have loved for many years and I thought that whilst , who I adore, is still in charge <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be the one to oversee it. I am grateful that Dominic has accepted my decision and together, since late last summer, we have been secretly plotting Peggy’s last scenes." [...] Treadwell-Collins said, [...] "when [...] told me her decision back in the summer , we both had a little cry before getting excited about how Peggy Mitchell, the matriarch to end all matriarchs could bid her final farewell to Albert Square. In Peggy Mitchell, Barbara has created one of the greatest ever characters on British television, someone who has become as synonymous with EastEnders as The Queen Vic itself. So {{this is the end of}} an EastEnders era. But it is also an opportunity to send Peggy Mitchell out in style in what will be one of the most heartbreaking, uplifting and epic exits an EastEnders character has ever had. We can't wait to have Barbara back at EastEnders, even if it is for the final time. The most professional of professionals on set and off, and a true friend, we have all been working harder than ever to make Barbara and Peggy Mitchell proud." [...] Windsor resumed filming on 21 March 2016.|$|E

2500|$|After a solid 10–5 {{score in}} July, in the September 2011 tournament Kisenosato raced to an 8–0 start, before losing {{three in a}} row. However, he then rebounded by beating Hakuhō {{for the third time}} in their last five {{meetings}} on Day 12. He finished runner-up alongside Kotoshōgiku on 12–3, his first ever runner-up performance, and also shared the Outstanding Performance prize. With 22 wins in the last two tournaments, he was once again a candidate for promotion to ōzeki in November. However, with a record of 10–4 going into his match on the final day, he lost to Kotoshōgiku. This gave him a record of [...] "only" [...] 32 wins in three tournaments, below the Association's loosely defined ōzeki promotion standard of 33, but the Sumo Association had already indicated before the match took place that he had done enough to earn promotion. This was the second successive tournament to feature an ōzeki promotion, following Kotoshōgiku. Kisenosato credited his success to his late stablemaster, the former yokozuna Takanosato, who had died suddenly shortly before the tournament. [...] "Everything that he taught me about sumo led to this result and I'm so grateful." [...] He had long been regarded as one of the most promising Japanese sumo wrestlers, but prior to reaching ōzeki there had been concern expressed about his seeming inability to hold down a san'yaku position and a possible lack of fighting spirit. His stablemaster had also criticized him in 2010 for his attitude in training. Kisenosato's promotion was made official on 30 November, following a unanimous vote by the Sumo Association's executive board. Chairman Hanaregoma commented, [...] "He has been solid through the last several tournaments. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> start putting himself in title contention." ...|$|E
