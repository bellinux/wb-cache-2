5|$|Most species live in forests, {{although}} a few are found in other habitats. Insects and other arthropods form {{the most important part}} of their diet, although small vertebrates are occasionally taken. Most species <b>feed</b> <b>in</b> the understory and midstory of the forest, {{although a}} few <b>feed</b> <b>in</b> the canopy and a few on the ground. Many join mixed-species feeding flocks, and a few species are core members. To various degrees, around eighteen species specialise in following columns of army ants to eat the small invertebrates flushed by the ants, and many others may <b>feed</b> <b>in</b> this way opportunistically.|$|E
5|$|A large, diverse {{family of}} wading birds. Different lengths of legs and bills enable {{multiple}} species to <b>feed</b> <b>in</b> the same habitat, {{particularly on the}} coast, without direct competition for food. There are about 89 species worldwide, 32 {{of which have been}} recorded in Leicestershire and Rutland.|$|E
5|$|In the spring, {{when the}} water reaches , the turtle begins {{actively}} foraging. However, if the water temperature exceeds , the turtle will not <b>feed.</b> <b>In</b> fall, the turtle stops foraging when temperatures drop below the spring set-point.|$|E

50|$|The olive warbler is an insectivore, taking {{insects and}} other arthropods. No {{specific}} information exists {{about the actual}} prey species taken, except that they will take the larvae of Tortricidae moths. It forages in forests in the canopy and subcanopy. <b>In</b> <b>feeds</b> <b>in</b> the outer branches and twigs. It mostly <b>feeds</b> <b>in</b> the branches of ponderosa pines, but also <b>feeds</b> <b>in</b> the branches of grey and silverleaf oaks.|$|R
5|$|Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River {{attract a}} wide variety of waterfowl. Lake Phelps is just one of several large, shallow {{freshwater}} lakes on the Pamlico-Albemarle Peninsula. These lakes are all winter grounds for ducks, geese and swans. The waterfowl at Lake Phelps use the area primarily for roosting purpose before flying off to nearby feeding sites. Tundra swans and Canada geese <b>feed</b> <b>in</b> nearby farm fields and the ducks <b>feed</b> <b>in</b> the wetlands. The waterfowl usually arrive in the area in October and overwinter until February or March. Commonly seen waterfowl are Canada geese, tundra swans, mallards, American black ducks and northern pintail.|$|E
5|$|The Mediterranean Sea is {{a nursery}} for {{juvenile}}s, {{as well as}} a common place for adults {{in the spring and summer}} months. Almost 45% of the Mediterranean juvenile population has migrated from the Atlantic. Loggerheads <b>feed</b> <b>in</b> the Alboran Sea and the Adriatic Sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability to}} {{excavate}} allows woodpeckers to obtain tree sap, {{an important source}} of food for some species. Most famously, the sapsuckers (genus Sphyrapicus) <b>feed</b> <b>in</b> this fashion, but the technique is not restricted to these, and others such as the acorn woodpecker and white-headed woodpecker also feed on sap. It was once thought that the technique was restricted to the New World, but Old World species, such as the Arabian woodpecker and great spotted woodpecker, also <b>feed</b> <b>in</b> this way.|$|E
25|$|More {{than a dozen}} {{kinds of}} looper feed on the spruces, fir, and hemlock in eastern Canada. The full-grown larvae of the larvae vary in length from 15nbsp&mm to 35nbsp&mm. Some <b>feed</b> briefly <b>in</b> the fall and {{complete}} their <b>feeding</b> <b>in</b> the spring; others <b>feed</b> mainly <b>in</b> the summer; still others <b>feed</b> mainly <b>in</b> the late summer and fall.|$|R
30|$|Although the {{physical}} and nutritional benefits of early enteral <b>feeding</b> <b>in</b> neonates are well-known, {{it has not yet}} to be controversial that early enteral <b>feeding</b> <b>in</b> preoperative term neonates with unstable hemodynamics due to congenital heart diseases is safe or risky.|$|R
50|$|The orange-fronted parakeet {{typically}} <b>feeds</b> <b>in</b> {{the canopy}} of NZ beech trees, but will also forage in low vegetation and on the ground. They are typically observed <b>feeding</b> <b>in</b> flocks of mixed species, eating various seeds, beech flowers, buds and invertebrates.|$|R
5|$|A large {{population}} spreads across the Hawaiian Islands every winter, {{ranging from the}} island of Hawaii {{in the south to}} Kure Atoll in the north. These animals <b>feed</b> <b>in</b> areas ranging from the coast of California to the Bering Sea. Humpbacks were first observed in Hawaiian waters in the mid-19th century and might have gained a dominance over North Pacific right whales, as the right whales were hunted to near-extinction.|$|E
5|$|Cassava {{chips are}} a common food in much of Africa, {{including}} the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana and Malawi. In Ghana, cassava chips are called konkonte. Dried cassava chips are also used to supplement the carbohydrate content of livestock <b>feed</b> <b>in</b> Ghana. In Malawi, cassava chips are prepared by soaking cassava, slicing it, and then letting it dry. This is the primary means by which cassava is transported to markets from production areas.|$|E
5|$|Cnidarians <b>feed</b> <b>in</b> several ways: predation, {{absorbing}} dissolved organic chemicals, filtering food particles {{out of the}} water, obtaining {{nutrients from}} symbiotic algae within their cells, and parasitism. Most obtain {{the majority of their}} food from predation but some, including the corals Hetroxenia and Leptogorgia, depend almost completely on their endosymbionts and on absorbing dissolved nutrients. Cnidaria give their symbiotic algae carbon dioxide, some nutrients, a place in the sun and protection against predators.|$|E

5|$|Cockatoos {{prefer to}} eat seeds, tubers, corms, fruit, flowers and insects. They often <b>feed</b> <b>in</b> large flocks, {{particularly}} when ground-feeding. Cockatoos are monogamous and nest in tree hollows. Some cockatoo {{species have been}} adversely affected by habitat loss, particularly from a shortage of suitable nesting hollows after large mature trees are cleared; conversely, some species have adapted well to human changes and are considered agricultural pests.|$|E
5|$|Dioxins from Agent Orange have {{persisted in}} the Vietnamese {{environment}} since the war, settling {{in the soil}} and sediment and entering the food chain through animals and fish which <b>feed</b> <b>in</b> the contaminated areas. The movement of dioxins through the food web has resulted in bioconcentration and biomagnification. The areas most heavily contaminated with dioxins are former U.S. air bases.|$|E
5|$|Okapis are herbivores, {{feeding on}} tree leaves and buds, grasses, ferns, fruits, and fungi. They prefer to <b>feed</b> <b>in</b> treefall gaps. Staple foods {{comprise}} shrubs and lianas. The main constituents {{of the diet}} are woody, dicotyledonous species; monocotyledonous plants are not eaten regularly. In the Ituri forest, the okapi feeds mainly upon the plant families Acanthaceae, Ebenaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Flacourtiaceae, Loganiaceae, Rubiaceae and Violaceae.|$|E
