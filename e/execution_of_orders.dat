In 1861, Phipps was stationed in South Shoebury, Essex. [...] He was promoted to the Royal Artillery's unique rank of second captain on 7 April 1864, and appointed brigade adjutant on 14 October 1868. The brigade adjutant functioned as the staff officer for the brigade commander: he supervised all brigade books and records, monitored the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>orders,</b> supervised the education and training of subalterns, prosecuted in all courts-martial proceedings, and accepted and transmitted all orders.|$|E
2500|$|Agha Mohammad Shah {{was more}} of a {{military}} leader than politician, and was known for his determined sovereignty, instead of a charismatic one. His military prowess was highly noticeable—Malcolm's evaluation, which was written some years after his death, says the following thing; [...] "His army was inured to fatigue, and regularly paid; he had introduced excellent arrangement into all its Departments, and his known severity occasioned the utmost alacrity and promptness in the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>orders,</b> and had he lived a few more years, it is difficult to conjecture the progress of his arms." ...|$|E
2500|$|But {{it is not}} on {{his skill}} as a regimental officer that Hampden's fame rests. In war as in peace his {{distinction}} lay in his power of disentangling the essential part from the non-essential. In the previous constitutional struggle he had seen that the one thing necessary was to establish the supremacy of the House of Commons. [...] In the military struggle which followed he saw, as Cromwell saw afterwards, that the one thing necessary was to beat the enemy. [...] He protested at once against Essex's hesitations and compromises. [...] In {{the formation of the}} confederacy of the six associated counties, which was to supply a basis for Cromwell's operations, he took an active part. [...] His influence was felt alike in parliament and in the field. But he was not in supreme command, and he had none of that impatience which often leads able men to fail in the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>orders</b> of which they disapprove.|$|E

But Knell was not there, and most assuredly not Poggin. Fletcher was no common outlaw, but, whatever his ability, it probably lay in <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>orders.</b> Apparently at that time these men had nothing to do but drink and lounge around the tavern. Evidently they were poorly supplied with money, though Duane observed they could borrow a peso occasionally from the bartender. Duane set out to make himself agreeable and succeeded. There was card-playing for small stakes, idle jests of coarse nature, much bantering among the younger fellows, and occasionally a mild quarrel.

60|$|I {{was at a}} loss {{now what}} to do; for hearing the guns, and by the noise knowing it was an assault upon the town, I was very uneasy to have my share in it; but as I had learnt under the King of Sweden punctually to adhere to the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>orders,</b> and my orders being to lie still till the foot came up with me, I would not stir if I had been sure to have done never so much service; but, however, to satisfy myself, I sent to the prince to let him know that I {{continued}} in the same place expecting the foot, and none being yet come, I desired farther orders. The prince was a little amazed at this, and finding there must be some mistake, came galloping away in the dark to the place and drew off the men, which was no hard matter, for they were willing enough to give it over.|$|E
