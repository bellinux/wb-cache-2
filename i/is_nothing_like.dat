With Vince leading the Lions, along with Luke Cafferty, new recruit Hastings Ruckle, {{and the rest of the}} team standing strong behind him, Eric Taylor has strong hopes for the team to go to state. But as Vince's past comes back to haunt him, it seems that the team will have to deal with struggles off the field, as well as on. Vince's troubles also cause his relationship with Jess to take a hit. Julie's college experience <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> she imagined, and after she experiences a difficult situation involving her history TA, she is forced to take a good look at what she wants.

The film features good aerial footage of both the B-47 and the B-36. The majority of B-47 scenes were filmed at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, using aircraft from the 306th Bombardment Wing.|$|E
25|$|Silverstone {{appeared}} with Queen Latifah {{as one of}} the stylists in the comedy Beauty Shop (2005), a spinoff of the Barbershop film franchise. She next starred in the dramatic thriller Silence Becomes You, which received a DVD release in October 2005. Silverstone did a pilot episode in 2005 with FOX called Queen B, in which she played a former high school prom queen who has discovered that the real world <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> high school, but it was not picked up for production. In 2006, she starred in an ABC pilot called Pink Collar as a woman working in a law firm, but like Queen B, this pilot was not picked up to series.|$|E

25|$|Edward now seeks {{comfort in}} a new favourite, Spencer, and his father, decisively alienating Isabella, who takes Mortimer as her lover and travels to France with her son in search of allies. France, however, will not help the queen and refuses to give her arms, {{although}} she does get help from Sir John of Hainault. Edward, both in the play and in history, <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> the soldier his father was – it was during his reign that the English army was disastrously defeated at Bannockburn – and is soon outgeneralled. Edward takes refuge in Neath Abbey, but is betrayed by a mower, who emblematically carries a scythe. Both Spencers are executed, and the king himself is taken first to Kenilworth. His brother Edmund, Earl of Kent, after having initially renounced his cause, now tries to help him but realizes too late the power the young Mortimer now has. Arrested for approaching the imprisoned Edward, Edmund is taken to court, where Mortimer, Isabella, and Edward III preside. He is executed by Mortimer, who claims he {{is a threat to}} the throne, despite the pleading of Edward III.|$|E

500|$|Geology was Darwin's [...] "principal pursuit" [...] on the {{expedition}} and his notes {{on that subject}} were almost four times larger than his zoology notes, although he kept extensive records on both. During the voyage, {{he wrote to his}} sister that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> geology; the pleasure of the first days partridge shooting or first days hunting cannot be compared to finding a fine group of fossil bones, which tell their story of former times with almost a living tongue". To him, investigating geology brought reasoning into play and gave him opportunities for theorising.|$|E

He Feng in The China Daily points out, [...] "the sheng nu phenomenon <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> the feminist movement in the West, in which women consciously demanded equal rights in jobs and strived for independence." [...] Rather, the change has been [...] "subtle" [...] and that [...] "perhaps decades later, will be viewed as symbolic of China's social progress and {{a turning point for}} {{the role of women in}} its society." ...|$|E
500|$|Mike Ryan of Uproxx {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, writing [...] "Newt Scamander <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> Harry, {{but it has}} to be this way. It all has to be different. And it is, but, again, with just enough 'sameness' to make us feel like we are at home again. I'm looking forward to wherever these movies are taking us". John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film is [...] "likely to draw in just about everyone who followed the Potter series and to please most of them". New York Magazines David Edelstein deemed the film a [...] "distinctly unmagical slog", remarking that the beasts [...] "aren’t especially fantastic and the effects are too blandly corporate to be exhilarating".|$|E
500|$|A made-for-television film, {{directed}} by Richard Pearce, was produced and televised in 2001, starring Glenn Close as Nellie, Harry Connick, Jr. as Cable and Rade Sherbedgia as Emile. This version changed {{the order of}} the musical's songs (the film opens with [...] "There <b>Is</b> <b>Nothing</b> <b>Like</b> a Dame") and omits [...] "Happy Talk". [...] "My Girl Back Home" [...] was filmed but not included in the broadcast due to time constraints; it was restored for the DVD, issued in 2001. [...] The last half-hour of the film features scenes of war, including shots of segregated troops. Lovensheimer states that the film returned to the Michener original in one particular: [...] "Harry Connick Jr.'s Joe Cable is a fascinating combination of sensitive leading man and believable Leatherneck".|$|E

500|$|Additional {{elements}} of South Pacific had their genesis in others of Michener's 19 tales. [...] One introduces {{the character of}} Bloody Mary; another tells of a British spy hidden on the Japanese-controlled island who relays information about Japanese movements to Allied forces by radio. [...] Michener based the spy, dubbed [...] "the Remittance Man", on Captain Martin Clemens, a Scot, who unlike his fictional counterpart, survived the war. [...] The stories also tell of the seemingly endless waiting that precedes battle, and {{the efforts of the}} Americans to repel boredom, which would inspire the song [...] "There <b>Is</b> <b>Nothing</b> <b>Like</b> a Dame". Several of the stories involve the Seabee, Luther Billis, who in the musical would be used both for comic relief and to tie together episodes involving otherwise unconnected characters.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{the restless}} American Seabees, led by crafty Luther Billis, lament {{the absence of}} {{available}} women– Navy nurses are commissioned officers and off-limits to enlisted men. There is one civilian woman on the island, nicknamed [...] "Bloody Mary", a sassy middle-aged Tonkinese vendor of grass skirts, who engages the sailors in sarcastic, flirtatious banter {{as she tries to}} sell them her wares ("Bloody Mary"). Billis yearns to visit the nearby island of Bali Ha'i – which is off-limits to all but officers – supposedly to witness a Boar's Tooth Ceremony (at which he can get an unusual native artifact); the other sailors josh him, saying that his real motivation is to see the young French women there. Billis and the sailors further lament their lack of feminine companionship ("There <b>Is</b> <b>Nothing</b> <b>Like</b> a Dame").|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} Broadway production enjoyed immense {{critical and}} box-office success, became the second-longest running Broadway musical {{to that point}} (behind Rodgers and Hammerstein's earlier Oklahoma! (1943)), and has remained popular ever since. After they signed Ezio Pinza and Mary Martin as the leads, Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote several of the songs with the particular talents of their stars in mind. [...] The piece won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1950. [...] Especially in the Southern U.S., its racial theme provoked controversy, for which its authors were unapologetic. Several of its songs, including [...] "Bali Ha'i", [...] "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair", [...] "Some Enchanted Evening", [...] "There <b>Is</b> <b>Nothing</b> <b>Like</b> a Dame", [...] "Happy Talk", [...] "Younger Than Springtime", and [...] "I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy", have become popular standards.|$|E

500|$|In September 2012 it was {{reported}} that a reel-to-reel tape of a complete concert by Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, from March 5, 1960 at Liverpool's [...] "Jive Hive", had been unearthed in the basement of his sister Iris Caldwell. [...] The recording was released on CD as Rory Storm And The Hurricanes Live At The Jive Hive - March 1960. [...] The concert had been professionally recorded in mono by radio engineers with a recording mike added onto Rory Storm's concert mike stand, but only one mike for the entire band. [...] The diary of Storm's guitarist Johnny Guitar reveals that in the week of the recording Ringo Starr was ill, and historian Mark Lewisohn has stated that the drumming on the recording <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> Starr's. [...] Four home demos were also included on the CD release.|$|E
500|$|One {{role that}} was not {{difficult}} to cast was Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty, the violent yet thoughtful leader of the replicants. Scott cast Hauer without having met him, based solely on Hauer's performances in Paul Verhoeven's movies Scott had seen (Katie Tippel, Soldier of Orange and Turkish Delight). Hauer's portrayal of Batty was regarded by Philip K. Dick as, [...] "the perfect Batty—cold, Aryan, flawless". Of the many films Hauer has made, Blade Runner is his favorite. As he explained in a live chat in 2001, [...] "Blade Runner needs no explanation. It just [...] All of the best. There <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> it. To {{be part of a}} real masterpiece which changed the world's thinking. It's awesome." [...] Hauer rewrote his character's [...] "tears in rain" [...] speech himself and presented the words to Scott on set prior to filming.|$|E
500|$|In his autobiography, Shankly gave {{insights}} into his character {{such as his}} world-view as a socialist, explaining that the socialism he believed in was not about politics but about collectivism, with everyone working {{for each other and}} enjoying a share of the rewards. That was the basis of his approach to football which is a team game in which everyone works together and shares the rewards. He admitted to idolising Robert Burns, whose birthplace was only 26 miles from Glenbuck and he was inspired by many of Burns' philosophical quotations, such as [...] "A man's a man for a' that". Shankly had no time for bigotry or prejudice, especially arising from differences of religion. He compared the cities of Glasgow and Liverpool by saying that [...] "fortunately there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> the Rangers–Celtic situation in Liverpool because the supporters of Liverpool and Everton are a mixed bunch whose religion is football".|$|E

500|$|More {{mixed reviews}} were {{critical}} of Diamandis' vocal delivery. Lou Thomas from BBC Music commented that [...] "he consistently diverting changes in style across the album are fine—the wonky 80s shoulder-pad pop of 'The Outsider' <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> anything else here, for example. But over 13 songs of Sparks-voice and many similar staccato piano riffs listeners may feel bludgeoned by Marina and her slightly overbearing presence", concluding that her eccentric vocals would polarise opinions. Sean O'Neal wrote on The A.V. Club that after [...] "dozens of squeaky Regina Spektor-ish enunciations" [...] and [...] "Kate Bush trills", the [...] "overbearing {{need to prove}} herself just ends up being exhausting". Joe Rivers of No Ripcord praised [...] "Are You Satisfied?", [...] "Hollywood" [...] and [...] "Oh No!" [...] but was put off by sudden [...] "howling" [...] in [...] "Hermit the Frog" [...] and a [...] "throaty growl" [...] in [...] "The Outsider".|$|E
500|$|Bhatti {{revealed}} that since appearing in EastEnders, {{people have come}} up {{to him in the}} street and called him a [...] "bad man", and that fans call him [...] "Dr Evil". In May 2011, Bhatti was nominated in the Best Newcomer category at the TV Quick Awards and the storyline where he tries to destroy the Masoods' marriage was nomated for Best Storyline. Bhatti was surprised to hear that Yusef is liked mainly by women, but {{in an interview with the}} Daily Mirror, he admits that he <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> Yusef in real life. BBC News branded Yusef as [...] "Zainab's sinister first husband", elsewhere, Metro.co.uk described Yusef as a [...] "deceptive doctor". Jane Simon of the Daily Mirror said that Zainab sending Yusef into the blazing building was a [...] "stroke of genius". Simon also said that it's unknown what Yusef is hoping to achieve with his [...] "one-man reign of terror. Being married to a woman he can’t stand, with a son he doesn’t want." [...] She added: [...] "It doesn’t sound like much of a game-plan." ...|$|E
500|$|Produced {{independently}} by Ecosse, Becoming Jane {{was given}} a limited budget of €12.7 million (£9 million or $16.5 million). Production designer Eve Stewart researched Regency literature and Austen's life, and along with Jarrold, scouted locations in Dublin and nearby counties for five weeks in January and February 2006. They ultimately opted to shoot in Dublin and the Irish counties of Meath and Wicklow instead of Hampshire, the birthplace of Austen, because it held [...] "a sense of countryside that felt more unchanged," [...] while Hampshire had unfortunately become too [...] "groomed and manicured". Jarrold also found [...] "a great variety of Georgian houses and older houses" [...] in Ireland. His production received funds from the Irish Film Board, the UK Film Council Premiere Fund, 2 Entertain, Scion Films, and Miramax Films. Film critic Andrew Sarris noted that in Ireland [...] "happily, there are still architectural traces of life more than 200 years ago to correspond with the year 1795." [...] However, Ireland did include a few disadvantages: Stewart found that [...] "the rural aspects were the most difficult as the Irish country landscape <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>like</b> Hampshire. There are no rolling hills so the vegetation and the landscaping was the trickiest thing {{for me as a}} production designer." ...|$|E
