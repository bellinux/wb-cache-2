40|$|<b>Greenfield</b> <b>sites</b> are {{believed}} to be locations where a separate and distinct approach to the management of people can most easily and successfully be introduced. After discussing different definitions of <b>greenfield</b> <b>sites</b> and examining whether the ageing of <b>greenfield</b> <b>sites</b> should best be characterised as a dichotomy or a continuum, this paper presents a two-dimensional framework of analysis for the employee relations policy of new plants. This characterises <b>greenfield</b> <b>sites</b> and assists in judging {{the extent to which a}} strategic HR approach can be sustained. Drawing on eight case studies, the paper examines both the start-up and consolidation phases of new plant development. A number of factors which inhibit sustaining a strategic HR approach are examined, focusing on the tension between ideology and markets. The paper concludes that the four-quadrant matrix approach appears to help assess both the initial approach and management's ability to sustain this over time. Suggestions for further research to test the matrix are made...|$|R
50|$|As part {{of their}} {{discussion}} on industrial land, the Port of Portland, Portland Development Commission, METRO and the Portland Bureau of Planning sponsored a Brownfield/Greenfield Development Cost Comparison Study {{with the goal of}} providing a better understanding of costs and issues associated with industrial development of <b>Greenfield</b> <b>sites</b> and the redevelopment of Brownfield sites. The study also compares Brownfield and Greenfield land development costs. Using case-studies, the project compared costs associated with specific industrial projects between Brownfield <b>sites</b> and <b>Greenfield</b> <b>sites.</b> Four types of industrial development projects were identified: general manufacturing, high tech, warehouse and distribution, and industrial park.|$|R

40|$|QWL {{programs}} were introduced at five petrochemical {{plants in the}} chemical valley complex in Lambton County, Ontario: three at newly constructed or <b>greenfield</b> <b>sites</b> and two at redesigned, existing sites. A random-sample survey of job enrichment and job satisfaction was conducted among blue-collar workers {{at each of the}} QWL sites and at traditional, unchanged petrochemical sites. Comparisons between employees in QWL and traditional sites showed no differences on various aspects of either perceived job enrichment or job satisfaction. However, comparisons between employees at <b>greenfield</b> and redesign <b>sites</b> showed several significant differences. It was concluded that there is greater potential for successful introduction of QWL programs at <b>greenfield</b> <b>sites</b> than at redesign sites and that a job-enrichment ceiling for QWL programs may exist in technologically intensive, continuous process production systems such as at petrochemical plants. Some unanticipated effects of QWL {{programs were}} also noted in that employees at redesign sites had lower satisfaction with job security and employees at <b>greenfield</b> <b>sites</b> had lower satisfaction with compensation.

25|$|Despite a move of yards, Yarrows outgrew its London {{site and}} this {{and the cost of}} land and labour in London led to a second move to what was at that time a <b>greenfield</b> <b>site</b> at Scotstoun in the west of Glasgow, {{beginning}} in 1906. Between 4,000 and 5,000 tons of material had to be transported, from models to heavy machine tools. A train-load of from forty to fifty wagons left the works at Poplar every day. The first vessel launched from the new works at Scotstoun on 14 July 1908 was the lead ship of the Pará-class destroyers for the Brazilian Navy. The company also established the Coventry Ordnance Works joint venture in 1905, building a large factory near to its Scotstoun Shipyard in 1910. During the First World War, the company developed the pioneering Erskine artificial limb with Sir William Macewen.|$|E

25|$|After the Robbins Report of 1963 {{there was}} a rapid {{expansion}} in higher education in Scotland. By {{the end of the}} decade the number of Scottish Universities had doubled. The University of Dundee was demerged from St. Andrews, Strathclyde and Heriot-Watt developing from technical colleges and the Stirling was begun as a completely new university on a <b>greenfield</b> <b>site</b> in 1966. From the 1970s the government preferred to expand higher education in the non-university sector of educational and technical colleges, which were cheaper because they undertook little research. By the late 1980s roughly half of students in higher education were in colleges. In 1992, under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, the distinction between universities and colleges was removed. This created new universities at Abertay, Glasgow Caledonian, Napier, Paisley and Robert Gordon. Despite the expansion the number of male students experienced a downturn in growth from 1971 to 1990. The growth in female student numbers was much larger and continued until, by 1999 and 2000, the numbers of women students exceeded male students for the first time.|$|E

This paper discusses the development of <b>greenfield</b> <b>sites</b> in Istanbul by examining the institutional structure of the land development process of some recent large-scale housing projects using a framework of institutional analysis. The result reveals that the public (through both the central government and the local municipalities) has {{an important role in}} land development by acting as both regulator and investor. These roles have been empowered by the recent changes in the law. Success has been achieved in terms of {{the quality and quantity of}} housing built on <b>greenfield</b> <b>sites</b> in Istanbul over the last decade.

It was finally decided that the best solution would be to move the College to a much larger <b>greenfield</b> <b>site</b> outside of the city centre and create a modern campus university. This move started in the early 1960s when the faculty of science moved to the new [...] park campus at Belfield in a suburb {{on the south side of}} Dublin.

The original site on the High Street was sold to the City of Glasgow Union Railway and replaced by the College Goods yard. The new-build campus was designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the Gothic revival style. The largest of these buildings echoed, on a far grander scale, the original High Street campus's twin-quadrangle layout, {{and may have been}} inspired by Ypres' late medieval Cloth Hall; Gilmorehill in turn inspired the design of the Clocktower complex of buildings for the new University of Otago in New Zealand. In 1879, Gilbert Scott's son, Oldrid, completed this original vision by building an open undercroft forming two quadrangles, above which is his grand Bute Hall (used for examinations and graduation ceremonies). Oldrid also later added a spire to the building's signature gothic bell tower in 1887, bringing it to a total height of some [...] The local Bishopbriggs blond sandstone cladding and Gothic design of the building's exterior belie the modernity of its Victorian construction; Scott's building is structured upon what was then a cutting-edge riveted iron frame construction, supporting a lightweight wooden-beam roof.
