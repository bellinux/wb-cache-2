No treatment-related effects were observed in pregnant females, frequency of resorptions, fetal weights, or skeletal/visceral malformations. Thus, long-chain alcohols at these vapor concentrations appear not to be toxic as evidenced by these fetal and maternal parameters...|$|R

30|$|In {{addition}} to the adsorption capacity of a given adsorbent, its kinetic performance is also of great significance for the industrial application. In a fixed-bed system, breakthrough curves can be constructed (Qiu et al. 2009). The plots of relative adsorbate concentration (C/C 0) vs. time are termed as breakthrough curve which is studied for each adsorbing species (water, ethanol, or other components present in system). The breakthrough time of an adsorbent is an important criterion in an <b>industrial</b> operation. <b>Alcohol</b> feed concentration affects breakthrough time. The primary reason for shorter breakthrough times with increasing water concentration is that the adsorbent is exposed to more adsorbate per unit time (Pruksathorn and Vitidsant 2009). Furthermore, the adsorbate adsorption rate is also a critical factor.|$|R

40|$|Deep-sea megafaunal biomass has {{typically}} been {{assessed by}} sampling with benthic sledges and trawls, but non-destructive methods, particularly photography, {{are becoming increasingly}} common. Estimation of individual wet weight in seabed photographs has been achieved using equations obtained from measured trawl-caught specimens for {{a limited number of}} taxa. However, a lack of appropriate conversion factors has limited estimation across taxa encompassing whole communities. Here we compile relationships between measured body dimensions and preserved wet weights for a comprehensive catalogue of abyssal epibenthic megafauna, using ~ 47, 000 specimens from the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (NE Atlantic) housed in the Discovery Collections. The practical application of the method is demonstrated using an extremely large dataset of specimen measurements from seabed photographs taken in the same location. We also collate corresponding field data on fresh wet weight, to estimate the impact of fixation in formalin and preservation in <b>industrial</b> denatured <b>alcohol</b> on the apparent biomass. Taxa with substantial proportions of soft tissues lose 35 to 60 % of their wet weight during preservation, while those with greater proportions of hard tissues lose 10 to 20 %. Our total estimated fresh wet weight biomass of holothurians and cnidarians in the photographic survey was ~ 20 times the previous estimates of total invertebrate biomass based on trawl catches. This dramatic uplift in megabenthic biomass has significant implications for studies of standing stocks, community metabolism, and numerical modelling of benthic carbon flows...|$|R
30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the response of the model fungus S. cerevisiae to bacterial signals, focusing on the influence of bacterial AHLs on growth, morphology and ethanol tolerance of S. cerevisiae. Two typical bacterial AHLs, 3 -OC 6 -HSL and C 12 -HSL, were selected for this purpose. 3 -OC 6 -HSL presents the short chain AHL with carbon chains of C 6 with 3 -oxo substitutions, while C 12 -HSL is a common long chain signal molecule with 12 carbon chains without 3 -oxo substitutions. The two AHLs provided good samples for evaluating the effects of diverse bacterial signal molecules on yeast, because of their differences in carbon chain length and functional groups. Our data clearly demonstrated that bacterial QSMs indeed effected on the growth and morphology of S. cerevisiae, and also change its ethanol tolerance, suggesting the interaction between prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes during coevolution. Moreover, our results could be drew some reference to increase <b>industrial</b> production of <b>alcohol.</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceAn {{increasing}} number of clinical and experimental investigations indicate that some xenobiotics are able to aggravate the nonalcoholic liver diseases (NAFLD) that are frequently associated with obesity. Indeed, different drugs, some <b>industrial</b> compounds and <b>alcohol</b> intoxication can major fatty liver, or accelerate the progression of fatty liver into nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Moreover, because of an increased activity of several hepatic cytochromes P 450 during NAFLD, some xenobiotics can more easily be transformed into toxic metabolites and induce severe acute liver injury. Clinical studies and experimental research are now needed to identify all the xenobiotics that can be particularly hepatotoxic {{in the context of}} obesity and to assess the different mechanisms of such higher susceptibility. This is a major issue if one considers the alarming prevalence of obesity in numerous countries, as well as the high number of drugs prescribed to obese patients in order to treat their different dysmetabolic diseases.
