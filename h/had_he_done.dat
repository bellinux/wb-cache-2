5|$|He was demoted to {{the reserve}} side soon {{thereafter}} by manager Míchel, who had replaced Bielsa {{early in the}} season, and made only one more senior appearance for the campaign. Much of his absence {{in the second half}} of the season also came as a result of him suffering from glue ear, a condition which traps liquid behind the eardrum and affects hearing. Míchel confirmed that Sparagna had been suffering from the condition since the start of the season and had unsuccessfully undergone treatment in late 2015. In April he began a new cortisone treatment but was unable to return to the pitch for fear that he would fall short of doping regulations as a result of the medication. Míchel later revealed that his reluctance to play Sparagna, despite the risks involved <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>done</b> so, ultimately contributed towards him being sacked by Vincent Labrune and Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, who at the time were the president and owner of the club respectively. Sparagna ultimately made 15 appearances across all competitions as Marseille ended the season in 13th position in Ligue 1 and as runners-up in the Coupe de France.|$|E
25|$|One {{question}} arising {{early in}} the story is why God rejects Cain's sacrifice, since Cain never received instructions about how to sacrifice correctly, nor <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>done</b> anything wrong, and why God then admonishes Cain with a warning about sin. The Midrash suggest that although Abel brought the best meat from his flock, Cain did not set aside for God {{the best of his}} harvest.|$|E

Indian captain Rahul Dravid declared before Tendulkar reached 200; <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>done</b> so {{it would have been}} the fourth time he had passed the landmark in Tests. Tendulkar said that he was disappointed and that the declaration had taken him by surprise. Many former cricketers commented that Dravid's declaration was in bad taste. After the match, which India won, Dravid said that the matter had been discussed internally and put to rest.|$|E

25|$|Charles Cutler Torrey taught Semitic {{languages}} at Yale University. His lasting contribution {{has been}} to show how much more meaningful prophets, such as the scribe of Revelation, are when treated as poets first and foremost. He {{thought this was a}} point often lost sight of because most English bibles render everything in prose. Poetry was also the reason John never directly quoted the older prophets. <b>Had</b> <b>he</b> <b>done</b> so, {{he would have had to}} use their (Hebrew) poetry whereas he wanted to write his own. Torrey insisted Revelation had originally been written in Aramaic.|$|E

Scarcely <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>done</b> so, when he saw the Cuirassiers rushing forward at the charge. To attract as little as possible their attention, he remained motionless. Most fortunately, the rapidity with which the Cuirassiers advanced amidst the twilight, already obscured by the falling rain, precluded them from recognising, or even particularly remarking, the group, although they swept so closely by that one of them rather roughly brushed against the aide de camp's horse.|$|E

25|$|It is {{a matter}} of {{speculation}} why Hannibal did not march on Rome or what might have happened <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>done</b> so immediately after Trasimene. The Carthaginian army instead marched south-east into Umbria, through Perugia, although Livy refers to a failed siege of Spoletum, a Latin colony, Polybius does not mention it, and it is likely that only some Carthaginian raiders troubled the Latin colony. Hannibal, all the while ravaging the countryside, marched through Picenum towards the Adriatic coast, reaching Herita 10 days after leaving Lake Trasimene. Here Hannibal rested his army, which was suffering from scurvy, refitted the Libyan/African troops with captured Roman equipment and retrained them, and by using low grade local wine (acetum) as an ointment, brought the cavalry horses back to health. With no Roman army situated near him, Hannibal was free to choose his next course of action unhindered.|$|E
500|$|One {{day after}} the race, both Matteo Tosatto (...) and Eros Capecchi (...) accused Démare of having used the tow of his teamcar to rejoin the pack after his crash before the Cipressa climb. Démare rebuffed these allegations, saying that the race commissioners were right behind him and would have disqualified him, <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>done</b> {{something}} illegal. On 8 May 2016, it became public that the Italian Cycling Federation was making inquiries into the accusations about Démare, with Tosatto {{saying that he had}} given written testimony to officials about the incident.|$|E

The {{character}} of Number One, the female second-in-command, was dropped on the insistence of the NBC network, and Science Officer Spock was given Number One's unemotional demeanor. NBC was worried about Leonard Nimoy's [...] "satanic" [...] appearance and pressured for his removal. As Roddenberry later explained at conventions, {{he felt he had}} a strong enough negotiating position to save one character, but not both.

[...] No sooner <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>done</b> so, on February 26, than President Harry Truman announced his opposition to various coin bills that had been introduced. [...] Acting Treasury Secretary E.F. Foley wrote in opposition, tracing the history between the OTMA and the Treasury Department, [...] "Coins were ordered to be minted and left in the mints". The Banking Committee opposed the bill, and it failed.

500|$|... "Death in Bloom" [...] {{was written}} and storyboarded by Jesse Moynihan and Cole Sanchez, from {{a story by}} Mark Banker, Kent Osborne, Patrick McHale, and series creator Pendleton Ward. The episode was {{directed}} by Larry Leichliter. Both Ward and fellow series storyboard artist Tom Herpich helped Moynihan and Sanchez clean up their story. One scene, in which Finn and Jake hide from the skeletons only to have Jake's flatulence alert them to their presence, {{was supposed to be}} storyboarded by Ward. However, he was extremely tired and offered Herpich $100—the amount Ward would have earned <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>done</b> it—to storyboard the scene instead. The episode features an extremely long pan showing much of the Land of the Dead. Moynihan noted that he [...] "wanted to really go over the top and make it like 15 pages but 7 pages felt right"; he later said that he wanted to [...] "blow kids' minds" [...] with the shot. Moynihan's original pan was redesigned by background designer Dan [...] "Ghostshrimp" [...] James, who also did some of the other backgrounds for the episode. Other background were done by Chris Tsirgiotis, who, according to Moynihan, was doing his [...] "best Ghostshrimp impression"; Tsirgiotis himself later noted that, [...] "Matching Ghostshrimp’s drawing style is pretty tricky. It looks simple at first glance, but it’s actually very sophisticated and nuanced." ...|$|E

[...] However, Emerson's Conservative opponent, Kanman Wong, claimed on February 10, 2006 that Emerson was seriously considering crossing the floor during the run-up to the election. Wong added that he would have stood down in Emerson's favour <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>done</b> so.|$|E
2500|$|It {{may have}} been {{possible}} for him to turn on and sink Renown by attacking from different directions, using Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, but the accompanying British destroyers were well placed to join the fight <b>had</b> <b>he</b> <b>done</b> so. His Commander-in-Chief, Raeder, endorsed his actions which would have placed him against a clear eastern horizon as opposed to an enemy that was positioned against a darkened western horizon. Action at that time would have given the enemy a clearer silhouette to aim at while obscuring the British ships somewhat. Moreover, if either German ship had been immobilised by Renown they would have been vulnerable to a torpedo attack by the British destroyers. Under those circumstances, Raeder felt the British would have had a tactical advantage. Lütjens later rendezvoused with the cruiser [...] and reached Wilhelmshaven on 12 April, having avoided a major fleet action.|$|E

Under the terms of the 22nd Amendment, Johnson, who ran for and won a full four–year term in 1964 was eligible to run for another full term in 1968 (as he had served less than two years of Kennedy's term).

2500|$|Leach {{was usually}} reelected without much {{difficulty}} (including an unopposed run in 1990). [...] He remained {{very popular in}} the 1st even as his district turned increasingly Democratic, especially from the 1990s onward. For most of his career, he represented the Democratic strongholds of Davenport, Cedar Rapids and Iowa City. The district has not supported a Republican for president since 1984, and by the mid-1990s most of its state legislators were Democrats. [...] The district became even more Democratic after the 2000 census, {{in which it was}} renumbered the 2nd District. This was despite the fact that Davenport, which had anchored the district for decades, was drawn into the 1st District (previously the 2nd District). Leach seriously considered running against fellow Republican Jim Nussle in the 1st District primary. <b>Had</b> <b>he</b> <b>done</b> so, it was considered very likely that the reconfigured 2nd would have been taken by a Democrat. However, Leach opted to move to Iowa City in the reconfigured 2nd and won reelection two more times. Still, it was considered very likely that Leach would be succeeded by a Democrat once he retired.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is clear}} from Stevenson's account that Ananda Mahidol could not have killed himself, either by suicide (as is {{sometimes}} suggested) or by accident. He was found {{lying on his back}} in his bed, not wearing his glasses, without which he was almost blind. He had a small bullet wound in his forehead and a somewhat larger exit wound {{in the back of his}} head. His pistol, a Colt [...]45 given him by a former US Army officer, was not nearby. The M1911 Colt is not especially prone to accidental discharge; it will fire only if considerable pressure is applied to the safety plate at the back of the butt at the same time as the trigger is depressed. It is a heavy pistol and awkward to use by an untrained person. It would have been almost impossible for Ananda Mahidol, a frail 20-year-old, to lie on his back and shoot himself in the forehead with such a weapon. <b>Had</b> <b>he</b> <b>done</b> so, the impact, according to forensics experts, would have blown his skull apart, not caused the small wounds seen by many witnesses. Stevenson writes that no cartridge case was found, and subsequent inquiries ordered by King Bhumibol, but suppressed by later governments, found that the Colt had not been fired.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas Brisbane, {{governor}} of the New south Wales colony, chartered Almorah to sail to Batavia and bring back supplies as the colony's food supplies were starting to run short. On 17 February 1825, Almorah returned to Sydney from Batavia. Captain Mitchell, of , which was serving as a guardship at Port Jackson, seized Almorah for having on board 300 chests of tea. He was urged on by Sydney merchants who did not like Government imports. Probably more importantly, Mitchell would have been entitled to {{a quarter of the}} value of the vessel and her cargo if the court upheld his seizure. There was no Court of Admiralty at Sydney, so over Governor Brisbane's objections, Mitchell put a crew aboard Almorah that sailed her on 2 March to Calcutta for adjudication. There [...] seized Almorah and her cargo. The charge was that the tea violated the EIC's monopoly on the private trade in tea. Litigation lasted five years without any definitive result. One problem was that Brisbane had not specifically mentioned tea in his instructions. <b>Had</b> <b>he</b> <b>done</b> so, there would have been no issue as the EIC monopoly did not apply to government purchases. Eventually the British Government persuaded all concerned to give up their claims. It also paid Almorahs owners £5000 for their freight and losses.|$|E
