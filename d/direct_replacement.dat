5|$|The NAIT 5si is the {{entry-level}} NAIT and the <b>direct</b> <b>replacement</b> of the NAIT 5i (with italic 'i'); the NAIT XS 2 {{is positioned}} as the mid-range product. The SUPERNAIT 2, the flagship integrated amplifier in the Naim stable individually decoupled inputs and no digital circuitry. Both incorporate a headphone output via a class-A headphone amplifier.|$|E
5|$|The iPhone 5S was succeeded as Apple's {{flagship}} smartphone by {{the larger}} iPhone 6 in September 2014. On March 21, 2016, the 5S received a <b>direct</b> <b>replacement</b> with {{the announcement of the}} iPhone SE, which incorporated internal hardware similar to the iPhone 6S while retaining the smaller form factor and design of the 5S.|$|E
5|$|In the {{transfer}} window, Arsenal sold Marc Overmars and Emmanuel Petit to Barcelona for a combined fee {{of more than}} £30million. Defender Lauren was signed as a <b>direct</b> <b>replacement</b> for Nigel Winterburn, who signed on a free transfer to West Ham United. French footballers Robert Pirès and Sylvain Wiltord were purchased from Marseille and Bordeaux respectively; the latter's arrival broke the club's transfer record.|$|E

50|$|The final trams ceased {{operating}} in February 1963, {{just a few}} days after the 100-year anniversary of the first tram in Buenos Aires. Most of the tram services saw <b>direct</b> <b>replacements</b> with the hundreds of buses purchased by the Government of Argentina from Leyland Motors.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the loss}} of captain and star striker, Eric Cantona {{at the end of}} the {{previous}} season, Ferguson acquired the services of England international Teddy Sheringham as a <b>direct</b> <b>replacement</b> on a three-year deal from Tottenham Hotspur for £3.5million. Cantona's departure meant that Roy Keane was promoted as captain and a reshuffle of squad numbers occurred; David Beckham was awarded the coveted number 7 shirt and Sheringham was given Beckham's former squad number 10. Henning Berg was the only other new face to arrive at Old Trafford from Blackburn Rovers for a £5million fee at the start of the season.|$|E
5|$|There is no <b>direct</b> <b>replacement</b> to Hubble as an {{ultraviolet}} {{and visible}} light space telescope, because near-term space telescopes {{do not duplicate}} Hubble's wavelength coverage (near-ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths), instead concentrating on the farther infrared bands. These bands are preferred for studying high redshift and low-temperature objects, objects generally older and farther away in the universe. These wavelengths are also difficult or impossible to study from the ground, justifying {{the expense of a}} space-based telescope. Large ground-based telescopes can image some of the same wavelengths as Hubble, sometimes challenge HST in terms of resolution by using adaptive optics (AO), have much larger light-gathering power, and can be upgraded more easily, but cannot yet match Hubble's excellent resolution over a wide field of view with the very dark background of space.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 353 AB convertible, {{including}} the military ABR version, was produced from 1936 to 1942. There was no <b>direct</b> <b>replacement.</b>|$|E

50|$|The ships {{served for}} 30 years, and {{received}} major updates in 1982—84 and 1990—92. After decommissioning they were scrapped or sold to different countries. No <b>direct</b> <b>replacements</b> were procured as {{due to the}} changed operating conditions the Deutsche Marine has {{reduced the number of}} these fast attack boats drastically and procured instead a smaller number of corvettes.|$|R
5000|$|The Effect class, in [...]NET 3.5 SP1 and 4.0, {{ships with}} two {{built-in}} effects, BlurEffect and DropShadowEffect. There are no <b>direct</b> <b>replacements</b> for OuterGlowBitmapEffect, EmbossBitmapEffect and BevelBitmapEffect, previously {{provided by the}} deprecated BitmapEffect class. However, {{there are other ways}} of achieving the same results with the Effect class. For example, developers can get an outer glow effect by using the DropShadowEffect with its ShadowDepth set to 0.|$|R
25|$|The Cadillac Fleetwood was retired by General Motors in August 1996 to {{make way}} for Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe production. Another reason was that Cadillac already had two large sedans in its lineup — the DeVille and the Seville, so no <b>direct</b> <b>replacement</b> was needed.|$|E
25|$|Biologically {{produced}} alcohols, {{most commonly}} ethanol, and less commonly propanol and butanol, {{are produced by}} the action of microorganisms and enzymes through the fermentation of sugars or starches (easiest), or cellulose (which is more difficult). Biobutanol (also called biogasoline) is often claimed to provide a <b>direct</b> <b>replacement</b> for gasoline, because it can be used directly in a gasoline engine.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Bandai {{developed}} two prototype units, {{and displayed}} {{them at the}} MACWORLD Expo/Tokyo '97 event. The Bandai ATMARK-PD {{was designed as a}} <b>direct</b> <b>replacement</b> of the original ATMARK footprint, and would have included an internal drive that can read a standard CD-ROM disc, as well as read/write to a magneto optical WORM PD disk with 600 MB of storage capacity.|$|E
25|$|The healthy {{men were}} sent to {{training}} camps to await new operations. However, when the army command evaluated the men and equipment required to return the Chindits to operational status, {{it was decided to}} transform the force into an Airborne Division in India. Beyond <b>direct</b> <b>replacements,</b> it was known that the British element of the Chindits would be decimated in 1945 by the need to repatriate personnel who had served more than four years overseas.|$|R

40|$|The George C. Marshall Space Flight Center {{is working}} to {{characterize}} aerospace AB 5 Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) cells. The cells are being evaluated in terms of storage, low earth orbit (LEO) cycling, and response to parametric testing (high rate charge and discharge, charge retention, pulse current ability, etc.). Cells manufactured by Eagle Picher are the subjects of the evaluation. There is speculation that NiMH cells may become <b>direct</b> <b>replacements</b> for current Nickel Cadmium cells in the near future...|$|R
25|$|The R-760 was a <b>direct</b> <b>replacement</b> for the R-790, {{with similar}} {{displacement}} and power. The U.S. Navy {{used it as}} the powerplant for several biplane primary trainers, including the Consolidated NY, the Curtiss N2C Fledgling, and the Naval Aircraft Factory N3N Canary. The last of these was produced in large numbers, {{with most of the}} engines built under license by the Naval Aircraft Factory. Trainers usually had the unsupercharged R-760E-T engine.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major factor}} in {{petroleum}} demand is {{the widespread use of}} petroleum products such as plastic. These could be partially replaced by bioplastics, which are derived from renewable plant feedstocks such as vegetable oil, cornstarch, pea starch, or microbiota. They are used either as a <b>direct</b> <b>replacement</b> for traditional plastics or as blends with traditional plastics. The most common end use market is for packaging materials. Japan has also been a pioneer in bioplastics, incorporating them into electronics and automobiles.|$|E
25|$|The Leyland 4-tonne {{truck was}} {{one of a number of}} types to be {{replaced}} by the UK Defence Procurement Agency's Support Vehicle programme, for which a contract valued at £1.1 billion (now quoted as GBP1.3 billion) was awarded to MAN ERF UK Ltd in March 2005. Under the Support Vehicle contract Rheinmetall MAN Military Vehicles (RMMV) will deliver a mixed fleet consisting of MAN HX and SX ranges of tactical trucks. The most <b>direct</b> <b>replacement</b> for the Leyland 4-tonne truck is the HX60 6-tonne truck.|$|E
50|$|To treat erectile dysfunction, both corpora cavernosa can be irreversibly surgically {{replaced}} with manually inflatable penile implants. This is a drastic therapeutic surgery meant only {{for men who}} suffer from complete impotence who have resisted all other treatment approaches. An implanted pump in the (groin) or (scrotum) can be manipulated by hand to fill these artificial cylinders, normally sized to be <b>direct</b> <b>replacements</b> for the natural corpora cavernosa, from an implanted reservoir {{in order to achieve}} an erection.|$|R
5000|$|... 24 two-car {{units were}} built as <b>direct</b> <b>replacements</b> {{for the elderly}} Class 416 2EPB units which {{operated}} on the Central Division of the Southern Region of British Rail. Units were delivered into traffic painted in Network SouthEast blue, red and white livery. Units were numbered in the range 456001-024. Each unit consisted of two carriages; a driving motor and a driving trailer. The technical description (when new) of the unit formation is DMSO+DTSOL. Individual carriage numbers were as follows: ...|$|R
5000|$|The Intel MCS-96 is {{a family}} of {{microcontrollers}} (MCU) commonly used in embedded systems. The family {{is often referred to}} as the 8xC196 family, or 80196, the most popular MCU in the family. These MCUs are commonly used in hard disk drives, modems, printers, pattern recognition and motor control. In 2007, Intel announced the discontinuance of the entire MCS-96 family of microcontrollers. Intel noted that [...] "There are no <b>direct</b> <b>replacements</b> for these components and a redesign will most likely be necessary." ...|$|R
25|$|ETC {{announced}} in 2012 {{a range of}} Source Four bodies using LEDs, including a model specified as being a <b>direct</b> <b>replacement</b> (in terms of light output) for the HPL tungsten Source Four. The shutter barrel and lens tubes are interchangeable with the HID and tungsten versions of the Source Four. Control of parameters such as colour and light intensity is available via DMX. The power usage is approximately 25% of that of the equivalent tungsten version, although the purchase cost is significantly higher. Lamp life is significantly higher at 50,000 hours to 70% intensity.|$|E
25|$|There {{had been}} no {{medium-sized}} sedan bearing the Citroen name since the 1930s. The Citroën GS introduced in 1970 finally plugged that gap in the Citroen range, {{and in the process}} paid tribute to the Panhard heritage. The GS was an exceptionally aerodynamic, modern and spacious medium-sized sedan with a compact air-cooled four-cylinder boxer motor driving the front wheels. Apart from the number of cylinders, that description fits pretty well with the car the Panhard 24 would have become had Panhard been permitted to build the range into a more <b>direct</b> <b>replacement</b> for the Panhard PL 17.|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to further improve the {{performance}} of the SB, which by 1939 was becoming obsolete, the development of two second-generation versions was authorised, a <b>direct</b> <b>replacement</b> for the SB and a specialised dive bomber. The level bomber, known as the SN-MN or MMN, had a new wing of reduced wing area and was powered by more powerful Klimov M-105 engines. Performance was little better than the standard aircraft and it was abandoned. The dive-bomber, designated SB-RK (later redesignated Arkhangelsky Ar-2 after its designer, with Tupolev having been imprisoned and being in disgrace) was similar to the MMN but was fitted with dive brakes and it was ordered into production.|$|E
5000|$|Williamson {{said there}} [...] "is no exact {{equivalent}} for the Osram type KT66, {{and its use}} is recommended where possible. When the equipment {{is to be used}} overseas, the KT66 may be difficult to obtain, and the 6L6 glass and metal types may be regarded as <b>direct</b> <b>replacements,</b> with the proviso that the total anode and screen dissipation should be reduced from 25 W to 21.5 W by reducing the total current from 125 mA to 110 mA by adjustment of R21." ...|$|R
50|$|Though {{personal}} defense {{weapons have}} not been very popular for their intended application, they have been acquired by many special forces and law enforcement groups as <b>direct</b> <b>replacements</b> for submachine guns. The FN P90 and Five-seven pistol are used by military and police forces in over 40 countries throughout the world, including Canada, Cyprus, France, Greece, India, Peru, Poland, Spain, and the United States. The Heckler & Koch MP7 is also used {{in a number of}} countries, including Austria, France, Germany, Ireland, Malaysia, and the United Kingdom.|$|R

25|$|The first variant {{produced}} from the DFV was a reduced-capacity unit for the Australia and New Zealand-based Tasman Series races of 1968–69. The changes between the DFV and DFW specification {{were limited to}} a reduced stroke, taking capacity to 2491cc and reducing power output to ~360bhp. This was the smallest capacity variant of the DFV that was officially produced by Cosworth. The engine was a <b>direct</b> <b>replacement</b> for its DFV parent in Lotus's 49s. The small engine proved just as competitive as the larger version; and Jim Clark took four victories in 1968, followed by one win for Piers Courage and brace of victories for Jochen Rindt in 1969. After {{the demise of the}} 2.5L component of the Tasman Formula following the 1971 season, the four DFW engines were converted to DFV specification.|$|E
25|$|During the 1960s, as {{strategic}} awareness {{increased and}} {{a multitude of}} alternative fighter designs were developed by Warsaw Pact and NATO members, the Lightning's range and firepower shortcomings became increasingly apparent. The transfer of McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom IIs from Royal Navy service enabled these much longer-ranged aircraft {{to be added to}} the RAF's interceptor force alongside those withdrawn from Germany as they were replaced by SEPECAT Jaguars in the ground attack role. The Lightning's <b>direct</b> <b>replacement</b> was the Tornado F3s, an interceptor variant of the Panavia Tornado. The Tornado featured several advantages over the Lightning, including a far larger weapons load and considerably more advanced avionics. Lightnings were slowly phased out of service between 1974 and 1988. In their final years the airframes required considerable maintenance to keep them airworthy due to the sheer number of accumulated flight hours.|$|E
25|$|Haroon {{also made}} his limited-overs debut during the 1999–00 season, playing two Tissot Cup matches and four National Bank Cup matches for Lahore Division. The {{following}} season, however, {{he switched to}} playing for the new Sheikhupura team, which was largely a <b>direct</b> <b>replacement</b> for the disbanded Lahore Division. In that season's one-day tournament, he scored a maiden half-century, 64 not out against Gujranwala, {{and in the same}} match also took what was to be his best bowling figures, 4/35 from seven overs. In the other one-day matches, Haroon was less successful, and in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, he failed to score a single half-century from his five matches, as well as taking only three wickets. During the 2001–02 season, he played only once for Sheikhupura, against Rawalpindi in the Quaid-e-Azam, which was his final high-level competitive match. Haroon had spent the 2001 English season playing club cricket for Market Deeping in the Lincolnshire Premier League, and remained with the club through {{to the end of the}} 2006 season. After that, from 2007 to 2011, he switched to Nassington, a club in the Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire League.|$|E
