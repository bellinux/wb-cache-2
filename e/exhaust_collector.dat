The resulting suspension was filtered (Whatman Qualitative No. 5) to separate catalyst particles prior to further analysis at various intervals. The ·OH quenching experiments were performed to determine the oxidation mechanism.

The catalytic converters are used in the test rig during the long term testing of the chain saws to reduce the hydrocarbon content from the exhaust before it enters into the environment.   To perform this research two approaches were carried out. One with Design of Experiment (DOE) and another using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis. In Design of Experiments parameters that are suspected to be influencing the performance of the catalytic converter were refined. Using these parameters a test plan is made with the help of statistical analysis application Minitab and the tests were carried out in the test rig. Using SEM the effects of aging and its effect on microstructure and chemical composition on the catalyst surface was analyzed. The results from the DoE shows that the <b>exhaust</b> flow, <b>collector</b> diameter and distance to the muffler are responsible for the collection of exhaust. Distance to the muffler and collector length are the factors affecting the conversion of the exhaust. In addition to that exhaust flow is also responsible for the duration of heating coil running time.         The results from the SEM analysis shows that the operating temperature is high due to which there is thermal degradation of catalyst and there is also deactivation due to fouling. Another finding is that the flow on to the catalyst is not uniformly distributed...|$|R

Most of the drills were truck mounted and used Rotoclone dry dust collection systems. Initial dust source surveys and the assessment of dust control enhancements for small mobile rock drills were presented in this report. A significant amount of airborne respirable dust was emitted from the Rotoclone type dust collector. Respirable dust concentrations measured around the drill deck ranged from 8. 658 to 95. 15 mg/m 3 with concentrations ranging from 1. 37 to 2. 69 mg/m 3 at distances of 12. 2 to 30. 5 meters downwind. Wind direction and speed were factors in the dust concentrations measured on the bench. Dust collector improvements were made on several drills to control dust from the emission sources. The results showed that adding a low flow of water to the <b>collector</b> <b>exhaust</b> may reduce the dust emitted by 92 %, increasing drill deck shroud containment and increasing the Rotoclone speed may reduce respirable dust levels by 63 %, vertically extending the Rotoclone exhaust may reduce downwind respirable dust levels by 62 %, and enclosing the Rotoclone hopper discharge may reduce levels by 80 %. Wet drilling, by injecting small amounts of water into the bailing air, appeared to be more effective than an improved Rotoclone drill deck shroud by 29 %. Repositioning the operator away from the drill during most of its operation can keep him or her out of the dust cloud and reduce dust levels by 69 %. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 NIOSHTIC no. 0023393...|$|R

An XF 7 C- 1 airplane, equipped with service cowling and with narrow ring, wide ring, and <b>exhaust</b> <b>collector</b> ring cowlings over the service cowling, was used. For these four cowling conditions, the rate of climb and high speed performance were determined, the cylinder conditions were measured, and pictures to show visibility were taken.

40|$|Among layer {{manufacturing}} techniques, Laser Consolidation (LC) {{finds its}} ideal application {{in the production}} of thin-walled metal parts for industrial niches characterised by high innovation and product complexity. To fully exploit the technological potential, developments must be made to assess LC’s repeatability and reliability. Previous studies proved that high strength parts of fine microstructure are obtained if appropriate build strategies are used. The aim of this research is to analyse a racecar <b>exhaust</b> <b>collector,</b> built in Inconel by LC, relating the failure modes and microstructure to the construction plan. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>collector</b> component was built using a custom strategy and was run on a dynamometer before failing after approximately 1200 km. An investigation of the failure mechanism was carried out by a primary macroscopic analysis, aided by an X-ray control and dye penetrant test. Metallographic sections were then sampled from the critical areas to study the microstructure and relate it to the manufacturing process. Results proved that the distribution of primary microcracks associated with internal residual stresses caused by the build strategy and aggravated by differential shrinkage during the test thermocycles was responsible for ultimate failure. This issue was a result of build strategy and the non-coaxial laser head, therefore, alternative pathways could be developed capable of removing most, if not all, of the contributory factors. The analysed case suggests that LC build strategy selection is as critical to ensure low cycle fatigue resistance as component design and confirms that LC is effective {{in the production of}} advanced technological parts with high geometrical complexity given the correct build strategy...|$|E
40|$|The {{laboratory}} {{dust collector}} {{tests showed that}} 99. 6 % of the test dust fed into the collector was captured by the dustbags. Figure 1 shows {{the condition of the}} main chamber before and after testing. Total weight gain on the canister filter was over five times greater without use of the bag. The RAM-I unit showed respirable dust levels in the <b>collector</b> <b>exhaust</b> to be over two times higher when tests were conducted without the bags in place. The APS showed that the" number of total dust particles emitted from the exhaust was two times greater when the tests were conducted without the bags. Since nearly all the dust is contained in the bag, operator exposure is improved when emptying the collector box's main chamber. Filter loading is greatly decreased when using the bags, enabling longer periods of drilling without filter removal/cleaning. Pressure drop across the filter for all tests ranged from 3. 0 to 3. 3 in w. g. when the bag was used and from 4. 0 to 8. 4 in w. g. without the bag. Filtered air emitted from the collector has less respirable dust and fewer total dust particles when the bags are used. These results show that benefits from use of the bags are realized in all areas of operator exposure. In order to use these bags in underground coal mines, the dustbags must be accepted by MSHA as an optional item for the specific dust collection system and machine model (30 CFR 33). In addition, the collector must be equipped with a predump option and must have a retrofit kit installed inside the collector to connect to the bag..

5000|$|The {{tendency}} of the 1.5 tonne DB 606 [...] "power system" [...] engines to catch fire became increasingly serious as the test programme progressed, {{and many of the}} He 177A-0 series of pre-production prototypes were destroyed in accidents or engine related incidents. The DB 606 engine had first been introduced on the Heinkel He 119 and later used on other aircraft such as the Messerschmitt Me 261 where they functioned as intended, but the extremely tight cowlings on the He 177A led to considerable problems, the most common being in-flight engine fires and engine overheating. There were several reasons for the flammability of the DB 606 engine as installed in the Greif's engine nacelle accommodations, one of which was the common [...] "central" [...] exhaust manifold, serving a total of 12 cylinders, on the two inner cylinder banks of the twinned DB 601 component engines making up a DB 606. This central exhaust system routinely became excessively hot, causing the usual accumulation of oil and grease {{in the bottom of the}} engine cowling to catch fire. When the pilot throttled back there was a tendency for the mechanical fuel injection pump on each component DB 601 engine to [...] "lag" [...] in their response in such situations, and deliver more fuel than was required by the engine, in addition to which the fuel injection pump connections often leaked. To reduce the aircraft's weight no firewall had been provided, and the aft end of each DB 606 was fitted so close to the main spar — with the rear two-thirds of the component powerplants' engine blocks being placed behind the wing's leading edge — that there was insufficient space for the fuel/oil fluid lines and electrical harnesses. The engines' exterior surfaces within the cowlings were frequently saturated with fuel and oil from leaking connections. At high altitude the oil tended to foam due to a badly designed oil pump, reducing its lubricating qualities. Insufficient lubrication resulted in the disintegration of the connecting rod bearings, resulting in the conrods sometimes bursting through either one of the component engine crankcases and puncturing the oil tanks, the contents of which would pour on to the often-overheated central <b>exhaust</b> pipe <b>collector.</b> The tightly packed nature of the [...] "power system" [...] engine installations on the He 177A, with the extreme rearwards location of the component engines in their nacelles, also led to poor maintenance access as well as very poor ventilation. As a result of these factors, in addition to a lack of routine maintenance in the field, the DB 606 powerplants frequently caught fire in flight. While theoretically sound, the effort to create an adequately powerful engine for the He 177 by mechanically coupling two pairs of lower-power engines into two heavy [...] "power system" [...] powerplant setups proved to be difficult to perfect, and led to numerous engine complications, turning out to be most numerous with the service test He 177A-0 and initial production A-1 models.|$|R
40|$|Researchers {{studying}} dust generation from blasthole drills {{developed a}} simple, quick fix that reduced respirable dust concentrations {{by more than}} 63 % at the dump point. This device, which requires almost no maintenance, is small and inexpensive, and it will help operators maintain compliance to the dust standard. The thought process was that a reduction of respirable dust {{at any of the}} multiple sources on the drill, in this case the dust collector dump point, should reduce the total respirable dust generated by the drill. The U. S. Mine Safety & Health Administration (MSHA) has a coal respirable dust standard of 2 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m 3) for an 8 -hour shift. MSHA and mine operators periodically collect personal dust samples to determine compliance with this dust standard. Drill operators have one of the highest exposure levels to respirable dust. This has been proven through many reviews of the MSHA dust sampling database. Prior to 1987, the highwall driller at surface coal mines had the most severe exposure to respirable silica dust, a trend that continues today based on MSHA's respirable dust sampling database. A review of the MSHA database for the years 1985 through 1992 shows that 81 % of the respirable silica dust samples taken exceeded the permissible exposure limit for the highwall drill operator at surface coal mines. A more recent review of the MSHA database, for the years 1996 through 2000, shows that only 31 % of the respirable silica dust samples taken exceeded the respirable silica dust limit for the highwall driller at surface coal mines. This suggests a substantial improvement in preventing the exposure of silica dust to the highwall drill operator. The drill operator, however, still tops the list of job occupations that have the highest exposure to respirable silica dust Respirable dust {{has been shown to be}} harmful to human health, especially when silica is present in the dust. It causes a disease known as silicosis, which can occur in three levels: chronic silicosis, which occurs after 10 years of exposure; accelerated silicosis, which occurs between 5 and 10 years of exposure; and acute silicosis, which can occur within a few weeks to five years of very high exposure to silica dust. Respirable dust consists of the dust particle size fraction whose median diameter is 4 micrometers (m). The drilling machine generates high concentrations of respirable dust from several sources: drill table shroud leakage, dust leakage through the table bushing, dust discharge from the dust <b>collector</b> <b>exhaust</b> due to impaired filters, and dust entrained from the dust collector fines dumped onto the bench.

He returned with Racine, his second wife in 1936 and began making frequent trips to South America over the next twenty years. Mulford had {{a great interest in}} finding both new and old species of plants that could be used as both indoor decorations and landscape material. In 1938 Mulford made a Cuban expedition and from this trip he introduced Agave caribbea to Florida. Around this same time Mulford met Lyman Smith who was working at Harvard's Gray Herbarium, being referred to him by sources in the Smithsonian. Lyman ultimately would be of help with the identification and classification of the bromeliads that Mulford would be collecting. It is Lyman Smith who directed him to Brazil as he had himself been there and collected specimens. Mulford had initially expressed an interest in exploring Dutch Guiana Mulford's and Racine's book Brazil, Orchid of the Tropics, a long out of print book but available through used sources was a well told story of their 1940 trip to Brazil. The book was a success and its completion brought the artful teamwork that was to mark the relationship between Racine and Mulford. His keen vision, liveliness and resourcefulness balanced with her devotion and help in caring for all of the plants and helping organize his materials, keep fastidious notes of her own were replicated many times over the years with many projects. In 1939 Mulford set off to Brazil again for six months covering much better known areas than their previous trip. Mulford was again able to find new species in places that were supposedly already previously explored and declared <b>exhausted</b> by prior <b>collectors</b> over the previous one hundred and fifty years. Mulford recollected a number of [...] "lost" [...] species during his trips to Brazil. He introduced the brilliant yellow flowering tree, Tabebuia umbellate to North America. This tree is now famous in Orlando, Florida. In 1940 he made his second six month expedition to Brazil and Trinidad this time specializing on bromeliads, orchids and philodendrons. From this trip he introduced many new bromeliads and the now famous self-heading philodendrons. World War II put a stop to further expeditions for some years. Mulford turned his attention to cultivating and popularizing the bromeliads. He continued to work with Lyman Smith who continued to describe and identify the bromeliads that had been brought back from Brazil in the preceding years. In 1946 Mulford resumed his expeditions. From Brazil he brought back the begonia acetosa and introduced it to US gardeners. He and Racine also traveled to Columbia. This trip followed the earlier trail of the famous Edouard Andre to confirm and add to his discoveries 75 years before. These were {{considered one of the most}} important bromeliad areas of Latin America. In 1948 he made a plant expedition around South America collecting in Dutch Guiana, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia Costa Rica, Cuba, Puerto Rico and Trinidad. Several years later in 1951 he would leave on a Venezuelan plant expedition. This was followed in 1954 to Jamaica with his final plant collecting trip made to Mexico in 1957. During these trips Mulford not only collected thousands of herbarium specimens for the Gray Herbarium of Harvard University and the Smithsonian Institution of Washington, DC where all of the scientific data is now on file but he also collected thousands of seeds and live plants to enrich the variety for Florida gardens.|$|R
