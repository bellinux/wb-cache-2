40|$|This study explores {{whether the}} {{introduction}} of selectively trained radiographers reporting Accident and Emergency (A&E) X-ray <b>examinations</b> of the appendicular skeleton affected the availability of reports for A&E and General Practitioner (GP) <b>examinations</b> at a typical district general hospital. This was achieved by analysing monthly data on A&E and GP <b>examinations</b> for 1993 - 1997 using structural time-series models. Parameters to capture stochastic seasonal effects and stochastic time trends {{were included in the}} models. The main outcome measures were changes in the number, proportion and timeliness of A&E and GP <b>examinations</b> reported. Radiographer reporting X-ray <b>examinations</b> requested by A&E was associated with a 12 % (p= 0. 050) {{increase in the number of}} A&E <b>examinations</b> reported and a 37 % (p= 0. 001) decrease in the time taken to report on these <b>examinations.</b> Radiographer reporting of A&E X-ray <b>examinations</b> was also associated with a 14 % (p= 0. 067) decrease in the time taken for GP <b>examinations</b> to be reported. That is, radiographer reporting A&E X-ray <b>examinations</b> allowed an increase in the time available to radiologists to report on <b>examinations</b> requested by GPs. An increase in the proportion of GP <b>examinations</b> reported by radiologists was associated with longer reporting times for A&E <b>examinations.</b> In conclusion, selectively trained radiographers reporting on A&E X-ray <b>examinations</b> significantly improved the availability of reports for A&E and GP <b>examinations.</b> No Full Tex...|$|R

5|$|Physical <b>examination</b> of {{the nervous}} system is {{typically}} normal apart from the presence of papilledema, which is seen on <b>examination</b> of the eye with a small device called an ophthalmoscope or in more detail with a fundus camera.

If the papilledema has been longstanding, visual fields may be constricted and visual acuity may be decreased. Visual field testing by automated (Humphrey) perimetry is recommended as other methods of testing may be less accurate. Longstanding papilledema leads to optic atrophy, in which the disc looks pale and visual loss tends to be advanced.|$|E
