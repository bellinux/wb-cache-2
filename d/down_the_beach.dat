5|$|Bayside: The dark, bearded Peter Fisk {{walks along}} the wooded paths {{of the island}} until {{reaching}} a beach. He strips and sunbathes on a blanket. Suddenly, out in the water, the blond naked Donovan appears and runs up onto the beach to Fisk. Fisk performs oral sex on Donovan, who then leads Fisk into the woods. Fisk grabs the blanket and follows, catching up to Donovan in a clearing. They kiss and touch each other, then Donovan takes a studded leather strap from Fisk's wrist and attaches it around Fisk's genitalia. They continue the scene, with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Fisk. Following Donovan's climax he returns to servicing Fisk orally and, as Fisk is climaxing, momentary flashes of previous scenes are intercut. The scene ends with Fisk taking the strap from his genitals and attaching it around Donovan's wrist. Fisk runs into the ocean and vanishes, mirroring Donovan's entrance. Donovan dons Fisk's abandoned clothes and heads off <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b>|$|E
5|$|Summer invites Ryan {{to a party}} {{after the}} show, and Ryan convinces Seth to join him. For the first time, Seth is {{introduced}} to the sex-, drug-, and alcohol-fueled side of Newport. He experiences the wildness of a party for the first time, while Ryan flirts with Marissa. Luke takes a girl to the beach. Later at the party, Ryan rebuffs an intoxicated Summer, but Seth misinterprets the encounter and reveals Ryan's real background. Seth walks <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> and is bullied {{by a group of}} water polo players that includes Luke. Ryan defends Seth by punching Luke, but Luke's friends intervene and beat up Ryan and Seth. After returning to the Cohens, Ryan sees that Marissa's friends left her passed out on her drive; he carries her to the Cohens' pool house to sleep. When Kirsten finds Seth and Ryan asleep in the pool house the next morning, she is unhappy with Ryan's new influence and insists to Sandy that Ryan leaves. Sandy drives Ryan back to Chino, but when they find his home empty, they return to Newport.|$|E
25|$|Specific trap {{sites for}} heavy mineral sand placer {{deposits}} are in beaches on the leeward side of headlands, as this forms a low-energy zone which traps sediments carried {{along by the}} longshore drift. Also, sand bars developed at the mouths of rivers which feed the placer deposits are rich trap sites where the winnowing action of the waves are most efficient, because heavy minerals, {{if they are going}} to be too heavy to be moved, will deposit at an isthmus in preference to drifting too far <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b>|$|E

25|$|On June 20, 2012, Aguiar's 31-foot, {{center console}} Jupiter boat, named the T.T. Zion, landed on Fort Lauderdale Beach east of East Las Olas Boulevard around 1:15a.m., with its {{navigation}} lights on and engines still running, {{according to the}} Sun-Sentinel. Sea Tow, the company that Fort Lauderdale authorities contracted to tow the boat, said that the vessel appeared seaworthy and did not believe a mechanical problem had occurred. Aguiar's wallet and cell phone were found on board, but no sign of him or any other passenger was found. Authorities on ATVs searched up and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> but found no sign of Aguiar. The Coast Guard commenced a search at sea. A search of his house found that his watch and wedding band had been left behind. In July 2012 and June 2013, the Ft.

25|$|Leaving garrisons at Reggio and Scilla, Reynier marched north, {{picking up}} troops as he went. By 3 July, he {{assembled}} 6,440 soldiers near Maida, south of Sant'Eufemia. Verdier's division was somewhere to the north, much {{too far away}} to reach the field. When Stuart got news of the French presence, he called in his outposts at Sant'Eufemia and Nicastro. The British general mistakenly believed that he outnumbered his adversary. Stuart's seaside camp was supported by Smith's warships anchored inshore. However, some British soldiers were already down with malaria. Leaving 16 officers and 271 men of de Watteville's Swiss Regiment to guard the camp, Stuart marched to the south <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b> Spotting this maneuver from his hilltop position near Maida, Reynier set his force in motion to attack the British force. He gauged that his advance would strike his enemies {{at the mouth of the}} Amato River. Seeing the French approach, Stuart halted his column, faced his troops inland, and moved forward to meet the French. The battleground was in a scrub-covered plain on the north side of the swampy Amato River. Whereas Stuart's force was in echelon with his right leading, Reynier's division was in echelon with his left leading. Therefore, the British right and the French left became engaged first.|$|E

When the tank attack was over, Vandegrift wrote that, [...] "the rear of the tanks looked like meat grinders." ...|$|E

500|$|Maulbetsch made {{a strong}} {{comeback}} in 1916. [...] Instead of spending the summer recovering from appendicitis, he spent the summer working as an assistant barkeeper on a steamship plying between Chicago and St. Joseph, Michigan. [...] Maulbetsch spent his afternoons swimming and running sprints up and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b> [...] On one trip, a giant coal passer {{claimed to be the}} strongest man in the world, and Maulbetsch agreed to a wrestling match on the boat. [...] "The coal passer rushed the stripling, who ducked, caught his opponent about the waist and crushed him to the deck. [...] When the giant woke, he wanted to know if the boat hit a rock." [...] As the season started, The New York Times wrote: [...] "Michigan's come-back football team, headed by Bullet Maulbetsch, {{is going to be an}} eleven to be reckoned with on the gridiron this Fall." [...] Maulbetsch returned to his prior form, and one of the writers who had criticized him in 1915 said [...] "the great Michigander using the same method of attack, has repeatedly broken in fragments this year the lines that he couldn’t dent in 1915." ...|$|E
500|$|Ichiki and 916 of his regiment's 2,300 troops, {{designated}} the [...] "First Element" [...] and carrying seven days' supply of food, were delivered to Taivu Point, about [...] east of Lunga Point, by six destroyers at 01:00 on August 19. [...] Ichiki {{was ordered to}} scout the American positions {{and wait for the}} remainder of his force to arrive. Known as the Ichiki Butai (Ichiki Detachment), they were an elite and battle-seasoned force but as was about to be discovered, they were heavily stricken with [...] "victory disease" [...] – overconfidence due to previous success. Ichiki was so confident in the superiority of his men that he decided to destroy the American defenders before the remaining majority of his force arrived, even writing in his journal [...] "18 August, landing; 20 August, march by night and battle; 21 August, enjoyment of the fruit of victory". He concocted a brazenly simple plan: march straight <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> and through the American defenses. Leaving about 100 personnel behind as a rear guard, Ichiki marched west with the remaining 800 men of his unit and made camp before dawn about [...] east of the Lunga perimeter. The U.S. Marines at Lunga Point received intelligence that a Japanese landing had occurred and took steps {{to find out exactly what}} was happening.|$|E

Eko confesses to him about killing two people on the first night of the crash and expresses his condolences before leaving.

Desperate not to let the timer run out, Eko goes to the stash of dynamite from the Black Rock, a ship which wrecked on the island before the plane. Eko's attempt to blow open the blast door has no effect except to knock him unconscious, and he is thus unable to prevent the timer's reaching zero. [...] As a result, the station implodes.|$|E

2500|$|When it {{was seen}} from the shore that the steamer was in distress, word was passed to the Yaquina Bay {{life-saving}} station, which was about [...] away and [...] out.

2500|$|The {{station was}} {{equipped}} with a Dobbins type lifeboat and a McClelland surfboat, which were launched into the surf from a four-wheel hand or horse-drawn carriage. [...] The station was also equipped {{with a variety of}} rescue equipment, including the Lyle gun, the breeches buoy, and Coston flares. [...] At times, surfmen rode horses to patrol the beaches [...] The station could call upon the assistance of a seaside railroad, the Ilwaco Railway and Navigation Company, to move rescue boats up and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> to get closer to a wreck before launching.|$|E

[...] As part of the recovery and replacement of the Frederiksted Pier, the old pier was to be removed and sunk far out at sea in 12,000' deep waters. [...] Much of the old pier was used to create an artificial reef. [...] Several barges carried the wreckage two miles <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> and dumpe the wreckage of steel girders, vehicles, concrete tubes, pylons, and pavement into 110' deep waters to create a dive site now known as Armageddon.|$|E

2500|$|While in Hawaii, Blake became {{fascinated by}} the {{traditional}} surfboards preserved at the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum in Honolulu. These included a variety of styles, from the shorter alaia to the heavy, 16-foot long olo boards traditionally reserved for royalty. On his 1926 visit, {{he was able to}} secure permission from the curators to study the boards' construction and restore several of them. He then began his own experiments in improving surfboard design. Up until that point, most modern surfers, even Duke Kahanamoku, used the shorter alaia boards due to the immense weight— up to 200 pounds— [...] of the solid olo boards. Blake initially sought to build lighter olos by drilling hundreds of holes in the board, then covering the openings with a thin outer layer. This was the style of board he used to win the 1928 Pacific Coast Championship. Then after three years of experimenting, in 1929, Blake constructed a hollow board with transverse bracing. [...] In 1931, he received a patent for his hollow surfboard design [...] "and opened the sport up to hundreds of people who weren't able to muscle the heavy plank boards <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> and into the water." ...|$|E
2500|$|Partridge Island is a {{significant}} historical, cultural and geological site located {{near the mouth of}} Parrsboro Harbour and the town of Parrsboro on the Minas Basin, in Cumberland County, Nova Scotia. It attracts many visitors including sightseers, swimmers, photographers, hikers and amateur geologists. Partridge Island is actually a peninsula that is connected to the mainland by a sandbar isthmus. According to local legend, the isthmus was created during the Saxby Gale of 1869. [...] The hiking trail {{to the top of the}} island affords scenic views of key landforms on the Minas Basin including Cape Blomidon, Cape Split and Cape Sharp. The nearby Ottawa House By-the-Sea Museum contains artifacts and exhibits illustrating the history of the former village at Partridge Island, which dates from the 1770s. Partridge Island is a favourite hunting ground for rockhounds because its ancient sandstone and basalt cliffs are steadily eroded by the fast-moving currents of the world's highest tides. Rocks and debris worn away from its cliffs are dragged <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> making it possible to find gemstones, exotic-looking zeolite minerals and fossils. Fossil hunters are warned, however, that although one or two loose specimens may be collected, Nova Scotia law requires that they be sent or taken to a museum for further study, and no fossils may be excavated from bedrock without a permit.|$|E
2500|$|The {{third season}} begins with Grayson proposing to Jules {{in the season}} premier. With {{the help of the}} Cul-de-sac Crew, Grayson tricks Jules into being less {{predictable}} in her day-to-day life, but when she fails, Grayson is able to plan ahead and propose to her outside at night under a teepee'd tree. The season follows {{the ups and downs of}} their engagement, including their many trips to a new psychiatrist (played by guest star Nicole Sullivan). Laurie guilts Jules into letting her be Co-Maid of Honor (Co-Mo's!) with Ellie, much to Ellie's dismay. Travis gets into a skateboarding accident while being pulled by Dog Travis, and goes into the hospital. His injury causes him to wear a helmet for six episodes. Laurie falls for a guy via Twitter, a soldier from Iraq named Wade. Meanwhile, Bobby falls for Travis photography professor Angie (recurring guest star Sarah Chalke). In [...] "A One Story Town", Jules and the gang decide Bobby needs help with Angie so they start [...] "operation kiss-the-girl". With help from Ted and his a'capella group, they pull it off and Bobby and Angie get together. (This episode also signifies a special Scrubs cast reunion including: Christa Miller, Sarah Chalke, Bob Clendenin, Ken Jenkins, Sam Lloyd, Robert Maschio, and Zach Braff). One of Grayson's old hookups, Holly, returns with news that Grayson is the father of her baby. Although Jules is extremely upset at first, she comes to terms with the fact that baby girl Tampa will be in Grayson's life from now on. Bobby soon finds out that Angie is cheating on him, although she says they never agreed to be exclusive, and they break up. Ellie's mom is introduced, and no one will believ Ellie when she tries to tell the crew that her mother is a sociopath. When a hurricane strikes Gulfhaven, Travis and Laurie get closer than ever when Laurie can't decide what to do about her army boyfriend Wade. Although he has feelings for her, Travis wants to see Laurie happy, so he tells her to try to make it work with Wade. [...] The hurricane destroys Grayson's house, causing him to move in with Jules. Grayson wants his and Jules's relationship to be more private and suggests that they elope to Napa, but Jules invites the whole group. While there, Travis and Laurie almost kiss but are interrupted when her boyfriend Wade comes back from Iraq to see her. The night of Travis's 21st birthday he gets drunk, strips, and tells Laurie that he has feelings for her and she is being unfair to him. Because Grayson's daughter isn't with them, Jules and Grayson decide not to elope, instead getting married on the beach near their home, but because beach weddings aren't legal there, it becomes a wedding on the go, and they walk <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> as they say their vows.|$|E
