Māori {{sometimes}} planted groves of cabbage trees (pā tī) to attract pigeons {{which could be}} snared {{when they came to}} eat the berries. Reminiscing in 1903 about life in New Zealand sixty or more years earlier, George Clarke describes how such a tapu grove of cabbage trees would attract huge numbers of pigeons: [...] "About four miles <b>from</b> <b>our</b> <b>house,</b> there was a great preserve of wood pigeons, that was made as tapu as the native chiefs could devise. At a certain season, the pigeons came in vast flocks to feed on the white berries of the Ti tree (bracœna) [...] and got so heavy with fat that they could hardly fly from one tree to another. No gun was allowed in the place. The Maoris, with a long slender rod and a slip noose at the end, squatted under the leaves and noiselessly slipped the noose over the necks of the stupid pigeons as they were feeding." [...] As the native birds have vanished from much of New Zealand with the clearing of forests, it is now flocks of starlings which descend upon the fruit.|$|E

40|$|Nonelicited peritoneal macrophages {{obtained}} from normal mice <b>from</b> <b>our</b> ani-mal <b>house</b> unexpectedly expressed a strong tumor growth stimulatory effect in vitro.

Thus, this tumor cell growth stimulation by marcrophages was probably due to a subclinical infection of the mice. Key words: macrophages, tumor, growth stimulatIo...|$|R

50|$|The stark, unornamented {{appearance}} of the International Style met with contemporaneous criticism and is still criticized today by many.
