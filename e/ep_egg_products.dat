40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} {{microbial}} spoilage of shell <b>eggs</b> and <b>egg</b> <b>products</b> and reviews the spoilage characteristics, {{according to the}} type of product and the flora involved. The methods available for monitoring, reducing, and detecting the spoilage of <b>egg</b> and <b>egg</b> <b>products</b> also are reviewed. [br/][br/][br/]Under healthy breeding conditions, the egg content is generally sterile. It can be contaminated by a diversified microbiota-containing food spoilage microorganisms. Moreover, egg breaking systematically involves the contamination of egg white and egg yolk through contact with the spoiled shells, thus giving rise to highly perishable <b>egg</b> <b>products.</b> This article describes the spoilage characteristic and microbial flora of <b>eggs</b> and <b>egg</b> <b>products.</b> Additionally, several methodologies are highlighted, allowing for the control, reduction, or detection of the spoilage of <b>egg</b> and <b>egg</b> <b>product...</b>|$|R
40|$|In this work, three {{freeze-dried}} (FD) <b>egg</b> <b>products</b> (whole <b>egg</b> (WE), {{egg yolk}} (EY) and egg white (EW)) were obtained and {{the acceptability of}} confections prepared with each was evaluated. Sensory analyses for confections were performed by hedonic testing with fifty panelists in each evaluation. The studied confections were: Condensed Milk Pudding (P), Quindim (Q) and Meringue (M). The results obtained for confections made with FD <b>egg</b> <b>products</b> were compared with the achieved through other formulations of the same desserts made with fresh (F) or spray-dried (SD) <b>egg</b> <b>products.</b> The sensory analysis results for confections made with FD <b>egg</b> <b>products</b> showed good acceptance by panelists. A principal component analysis of the sensory evaluation data was carried out to identify similarities between the different <b>egg</b> <b>products.</b> The PCA supported the conclusion that FD <b>egg</b> <b>products</b> can substitute their fresh and SD counterparts in dessert formulations with good acceptability while keeping the advantages conferred by the freeze-drying method...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this module is to {{calculate}} the number of Salmonella Enteritidis bacteria in six different egg products: liquid whole egg, liquid yolk, liquid albumen, frozen whole egg, frozen yolk, and frozen albumen. This is done by tracking the change in numbers of Salmonella Enteritidis through the production processes of <b>egg</b> <b>products</b> plants. The <b>egg</b> <b>products</b> industry processed 17 billion eggs or 27 % of the U. S. production of eggs in 1996 (Figure C- 1). Eggs arriving at <b>egg</b> <b>products</b> plants originate from two sources. Nest run eggs from poultry layer flocks constituted 88 % of all eggs processed in 1996. Restricted eggs sent from egg grading plants constituted 12 % of all eggs processed in 1996 (Figure C- 1). The six products modeled here (liquid and frozen forms of whole egg, albumen, and yolk) constitute about 44 % (32 % + 12 %) of the <b>egg</b> <b>products</b> produced (Table C- 1). The remaining 56 % of <b>egg</b> <b>products</b> shown in Table C- 1 are not simulated in this module. The estimates of the amounts of product in Table C- 1 are based on data collected by the <b>Egg</b> <b>Products</b> Inspection Division, Food Safety and Inspection Service for 1996.

40|$|Pigs were weaned at {{approximately}} 18 days {{of age and}} fed diets containing inedible <b>egg</b> <b>product,</b> spray-dried plasma (SDP), or the combination of both for 2 weeks postweaning. They then received a common diet for an additional 2 weeks after the treatment period. The impact of these dietary ingredients on growth performance was evaluated. Inedible <b>egg</b> <b>product</b> did not improve growth or feed efficiency of pigs compared with those fed the control diet during the 2 -week treatment period. However, SDP increased body weight gain and feed efficiency during the treatment period. The improved performance over the control group that resulted from feeding a combination of SDP and <b>egg</b> <b>product</b> was primarily dependent upon the SDP. In the third week, a trend occurred for improved performance of pigs fed the <b>egg</b> <b>product</b> compared with those fed 4 % SDP; however, {{the difference was not}} significant. During this same period, pigs previously fed SDP gained weight slower and consumed less feed than those that had not been fed SDP. Therefore, the response to SDP was partially lost when it was removed from the diet. In summary, the outcome of this study demonstrated that inedible <b>egg</b> <b>product</b> was an adequate source of protein for the weanling pig but did not provide measurable improvements over the control diet.

Unlike shell eggs which are protected by the physic al barriers of the eggshell and the shell membranes and by the efficient antimicrobial activi ties of <b>egg</b> white, <b>egg</b> <b>products</b> are very sensitive from a microbiological point of view.
