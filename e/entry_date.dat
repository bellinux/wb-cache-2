25|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} these inaugural qualification sessions, which were held on 27 and 28 May 1911, anecdotes would occasionally arise, and thereafter be steadily embellished in their retelling, regarding the purported qualifying times and speeds of given competitors, and how they compared to one another. In reality, no records of the sessions were kept at all, let alone publicized, with the sole objective being the confirmation of each car's capability to achieve the minimum speed. Also in contrast to later eras, both the starting order and the car numbering {{of the participants were}} determined not by respective speeds or previous seasonal point totals, but by <b>entry</b> <b>date,</b> with the Strang-driven Case entry being assigned #1 in the first starting position.|$|E
25|$|Once an <b>entry</b> <b>date</b> {{had been}} confirmed, the Port Adelaide Football Club set about forming a side fit for {{competition}} in the AFL. It was announced that existing Port Adelaide coach, John Cahill would {{make the transition to}} the AFL and Stephen Williams would take over the SANFL coaching role. Cahill then set about forming a group which would form the inaugural squad. Brownlow Medallist and 1990 Port Adelaide premiership player, Gavin Wanganeen was poached from Essendon and made captain of a team made up of six existing Port Adelaide players, two from the Adelaide Crows, seven players from other SANFL clubs and 14 recruits from interstate. Of the 35 players on Port Adelaide's inaugural AFL list 13 had played for the club before. The AFL's father son rule for the club was set at 200 games for players before 1997. This compared to only 100 for Victorian clubs.|$|E

25|$|Ouabano was {{a band of}} Mohicans or Eastern Lenape, {{like the}} others {{westerly}} of the state, who traded with the Spanish before the French arrival. It was Minsis and Mohican who led some Shawnee from Lower Ohio Valley in 1692 to join the Minisink villagers of the Delaware (Hanna 1911:158). Soon, these provided guides followed by the Viele of Albany Expedition. The Shawnee arrived later in the century by 1697 on the Eastern Panhandle with Sauvanoos from the south east colonies (Darlington; Hanna). Batts and Fallams, 1671, briefly mentions an abandoned Mohican village (Mohecan as transcribed journal <b>entry</b> <b>date</b> September 16, 1671, Summers 1929) on the Kanawha-New River area. Beginning in the late 18th century on modern maps, Big and Little Loup creeks are found opposite of Alloy bottom below the Kanawha Falls about three miles. It is about two miles upstream of Mt Carbon of Armstrong Creek with local ancient stone wall legends occasionally heard.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, from 1955 onwards, the UK {{had shown}} {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} Arrow. Desiring a high-performance interceptor like the Arrow, the RAF began the F.155 program in 1955, projecting a service <b>entry</b> <b>date</b> of 1962.
