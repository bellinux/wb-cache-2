The narcissus he preferred were the small, delicate ones from the Iberian peninsula.

Nor did Robinson's 'wild' approach refer to letting gardens return to their natural state—he taught a specific gardening method and aesthetic.

500|$|The {{morphology}} of Millepora alcicornis is very variable. Most colonies probably {{start as}} encrusting forms and adopt a branching structure as they grow. The encrustations can become established {{on a variety}} of structures, not only on coral reefs and rocks but also on dead corals and the hulls of wrecked ships. Later development {{is in the form of}} plates or blades in habitats with much water movement such as the surf-pounded outer edges of reefs. In calmer waters, such as in deep lagoons or more sheltered parts of the reef, a more upright, leafy or branched structure develops which can grow to [...] tall. The <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> is also influenced by the inclination of the surface on which the fire coral grows. On vertical surfaces, the encrusting bases are larger with longer perimeters and the density of branching is lower than it is on horizontal surfaces. The cylindrical branches usually grow in a single plane and span a range of hues from brown to pale, cream-like yellow, while branch tips are white.|$|E

50|$|Alcyonium coralloides {{has several}} {{different}} <b>habits</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth.</b> In the Atlantic Ocean it sometimes grows as encrusting sheets over rock surfaces. These are red with white or yellow polyps, sometimes having bare areas from which polyps are absent. More frequently, it grows in short finger-like lobes up to 4 cm long, pale pink with white polyps. It seldom encrusts sea fans.|$|R

50|$|Colonies of A. agaricites {{have several}} {{different}} <b>habits</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth,</b> but usually occur in encrusting sheets with irregular projections or are leaf-like or plate-like. New colonies are usually encrusting, but vertical lobes and sheet-like projections {{begin to develop}} when the colonies are still quite small. The growth form seems to be partially linked to the movement {{of water in the}} vicinity and the depth. Horizontal plates normally have corallites on both sides while vertical forms have corallites on only one side. The corallites are arranged in long meandering rows, but a few are single, with sharp-pointed ridges between them. Each one has up to 36 septa and a central spongy columella. This coral is a brown or purplish-brown colour.|$|R
6000|$|This <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> should, no doubt, be encouraged; {{and they}} should not be trimmed up, as some {{travelling}} practitioners have advised. In 1802 {{there was not a single}} fruit-tree in Chatham, the next town to Orleans, on the south; and the old account of Orleans says: [...] "Fruit-trees cannot be made to grow within a mile of the ocean. Even those which are placed at a greater distance are injured by the east winds; and, after violent storms in the spring, a saltish taste is perceptible on their bark." [...] We noticed that they were often covered with a yellow lichen-like rust, the Parmelia parietina.|$|E
60|$|In {{the early}} {{half of the}} present chapter I have given {{a long list of}} plants in which through bud-variation, that is, {{independently}} of reproduction by seed, the fruit has suddenly become modified in size, colour, flavour, hairiness, shape, and time of maturity; flowers have similarly changed in shape, colour, in being double, and greatly in the character of the calyx; young branches or shoots have changed in colour, in bearing spines and in <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth,</b> as in climbing or in weeping; leaves have changed in becoming variegated, in shape, period of unfolding, and in their arrangement on the axis. Buds of all kinds, whether produced on ordinary branches or on subterranean stems, whether simple or much modified and supplied with a stock of nutriment, as in tubers and bulbs, are all liable to sudden variations of the same general nature.|$|E
6000|$|... 11. Before I attempt {{arranging}} its families, we must {{note that}} while the corolla itself {{is one of the}} most constant in form, and so distinct from all other blossoms that it may be always known at a glance; the leaves and <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> vary so greatly in families of different climates, and those born for special situations, moist or dry, and the like, that it is quite impossible to characterize Veronic, or Veronique, vegetation in general terms. One can say, comfortably, of a strawberry, that it is a creeper, without expecting at the next moment to see a steeple of strawberry blossoms rise to contradict us;--we can venture to say of a foxglove that it grows in a spire, without any danger of finding, farther on, a carpet of prostrate and entangling digitalis; and we may pronounce of a buttercup that it grows mostly in meadows, without fear of finding ourselves, at the edge of the next thicket, under the shadow of a buttercup-bush growing into valuable timber. But the Veronica reclines with the lowly,[21] upon occasion, and aspires, with the proud; is here the pleased companion of the ground-ivies, and there the unrebuked rival of the larkspurs: on the rocks of Coniston it effaces itself almost into the film of a lichen; it pierces the snows of Iceland with the gentian: and in the Falkland Islands is a white-blossomed evergreen, of which botanists are in dispute whether it be Veronica or Olive.|$|E

60|$|Three {{days and}} nights we waited there, and on the fourth morning I made shift to cross, losing four men by {{drowning}} in the passage. Once over, I hid my force in the bush and reeds, and crept forward with six men only, to see if I could discover anything of the whereabouts of the Spaniards. Within an hour I struck the trail that they had cut through the forest, and followed it cautiously. Presently {{we came to a}} spot where the forest was thin, and here Cortes had camped, for there was heat left in the ashes of his fires, and among them lay the body of an Indian who had died from sickness. Not fifty yards from this camp stood a huge ceiba, a tree that has a <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> not unlike that of our English oak, though it is soft wooded and white barked, and will increase more in bulk in twenty years than any oak may in a hundred. Indeed I never yet saw an oak tree so large as this ceiba of which I write, either in girth or in its spread of top, unless it be the Kirby oak or the tree that is called the 'King of Scoto' which grows at Broome, that is the next parish to this of Ditchingham in Norfolk. On this ceiba tree many zaphilotes or vultures were perched, and as we crept towards it I saw what it was they came to seek, for from the lowest branches of the ceiba three corpses swung in the breeze. 'Here are the Spaniard's footprints,' I said. 'Let us look at them,' and we passed beneath the shadow of the tree.|$|E
6000|$|I will {{conclude}} with a few allied cases, which may be ranked either under bud-variation, or under the direct action of the conditions of life. When the common Hepatica is transplanted from its native woods, the flowers change colour, even during the first year. (11/87. Godron 'De l'Espece' tome 2 page 84.) It is notorious that the improved varieties of the Heartsease (Viola tricolor), when transplanted, often produce flowers widely different in size, form, and colour: for instance, I transplanted a large uniformly-coloured dark purple variety, whilst in full flower, and it then produced much smaller, more elongated flowers, with the lower petals yellow; these were succeeded by flowers marked with large purple spots, and ultimately, {{towards the end of}} the same summer, by the original large dark purple flowers. The slight changes which some fruit-trees undergo from being grafted and regrafted on various stocks (11/88. M. Carriere has lately described in the 'Revue Horticole' December 1, 1866 page 457, an extraordinary case. He twice inserted grafts of the Aria vestita on thorn- trees (epines) growing in pots; and the grafts, as they grew, produced shoots with bark, buds, leaves, petioles, petals, and flower-stalks, all widely different from those of the Aria. The grafted shoots were also much hardier, and flowered earlier, than those on the ungrafted Aria.) were considered by Andrew Knight (11/89. 'Transact. Hort. Soc.' volume 2 page 160.) as closely allied to [...] "sporting branches," [...] or bud-variations. Again, we have the case of young fruit-trees changing their character as they grow old; seedling pears, for instance, lose with age their spines and improve in the flavour of their fruit. Weeping birch-trees, when grafted on the common variety, do not acquire a perfect pendulous habit until they grow old: on the other hand, I shall hereafter give the case of some weeping ashes which slowly and gradually assumed an upright <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth.</b> All such changes, dependent on age, may be compared with the changes, alluded to in the last chapter, which many trees naturally undergo; as in the case of the Deodar and Cedar of Lebanon, which are unlike in youth, whilst they closely resemble each other in old age; and as with certain oaks, and with some varieties of the lime and hawthorn. (11/90. For the cases of oaks see Alph. De Candolle in 'Bibl. Univers.' Geneva November 1862; for limes etc. Loudon's 'Gard. Mag.' volume 11 1835 page 503.)] ...|$|E
60|$|Analogous facts {{have been}} {{observed}} with plants: Major Trevor Clarke crossed the little, glabrous-leaved, annual stock (Matthiola), with pollen of a large, red-flowered, rough-leaved, biennial stock, called cocardeau by the French, {{and the result was}} that half the seedlings had glabrous and the other half rough leaves, but none had leaves in an intermediate state. That the glabrous seedlings were the product of the rough-leaved variety, and not accidentally of the mother-plant's own pollen, was shown by their tall and strong <b>habit</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth.</b> (15/19. 'Internat. Hort. and Bot. Congress of London' 1866.) in the succeeding generations raised from the rough-leaved crossed seedlings, some glabrous plants appeared, showing that the glabrous character, though incapable of blending with and modifying the rough leaves, was all the time latent in this family of plants. The numerous plants formerly referred to, which I raised from reciprocal crosses between the peloric and common Antirrhinum, offer a nearly parallel case; for in the first generation all the plants resembled the common form, and in the next generation, out of one hundred and thirty-seven plants, two alone were in an intermediate condition, the others perfectly resembling either the peloric or common form. Major Trevor Clarke also fertilised the above-mentioned red-flowered stock with pollen from the purple Queen stock, and about half the seedlings scarcely differed in habit, and not at all in the red colour of the flower, from the mother-plant, the other half bearing blossoms of a rich purple, closely like those of the paternal plant. Gartner crossed many white and yellow-flowered species and varieties of Verbascum; and these colours were never blended, but the offspring bore either pure white or pure yellow blossoms; the former in the larger proportion. (15/20. 'Bastarderzeugung' s. 307. Kolreuter 'Dritte Fortsetszung' s. 34, 39 however, obtained intermediate tints from similar crosses in the genus Verbascum. With respect to the turnips see Herbert 'Amaryllidaceae' 1837 page 370.) Dr. Herbert raised many seedlings, as he informed me, from Swedish turnips crossed by two other varieties, and these never produced flowers of an intermediate tint, but always like one of their parents. I fertilised the purple sweet-pea (Lathyrus odoratus), which has a dark reddish-purple standard-petal and violet-coloured wings and keel, with pollen of the painted lady sweet-pea, which has a pale cherry-coloured standard, and almost white wings and keel; and from the same pod I twice raised plants perfectly resembling both sorts; the greater number resembling the father. So perfect was the resemblance, that I should have thought there had been some mistake, if the plants which were at first identical with the paternal variety, namely, the painted-lady, had not later in the season produced, as mentioned in a former chapter, flowers blotched and streaked with dark purple. I raised grandchildren and great-grandchildren from these crossed plants, and they continued to resemble the painted-lady, but during later generations became rather more blotched with purple, yet none reverted completely to the original mother-plant, the purple sweet-pea. The following case is slightly different, but still shows the same principle: Naudin (15/21. 'Nouvelles Archives du Museum' tome 1 page 100.) raised numerous hybrids between the yellow Linaria vulgaris and the purple L. purpurea, and during three successive generations the colours kept distinct {{in different parts of the}} same flower.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{to other}} genera {{of the family}} Araceae, philodendrons have an {{extremely}} diverse array <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> methods. The <b>habits</b> <b>of</b> <b>growth</b> can be epiphytic, hemiepiphytic, or rarely terrestrial. Others can show a combination <b>of</b> these <b>growth</b> <b>habits</b> depending on the environment. Hemiepiphytic philodendrons can be classified into two types: primary and secondary hemiepiphytes. A primary hemiepiphytic philodendron starts life {{high up in the}} canopy where the seed initially sprouts. The plant then grows as an epiphyte. Once it has reached a sufficient size and age, it will begin producing aerial roots that grow toward the forest floor. Once they reach the forest floor, nutrients can be obtained directly from the soil. In this manner, the plant's strategy is to obtain light early in its life at the expense of nutrients. Some primary epiphytic species have a symbiotic relationship with ants. In these species, the ants' nest is grown amongst the plant's roots, which help keep the nest together. Philodendrons have extrafloral nectaries, glands that secrete nectar to attract the ants. The philodendron, in turn, obtains nutrients from the surrounding ant nest, and the aggressive nature of the ants serves to protect the plant from other insects which would eat it.|$|R

The ZnO nanorods were irradiated with electron beam (30 kV) for 100 minutes. We observed that the one-dimensional (1 -D) ZnO nanorods were resistant to the electron radiation.
