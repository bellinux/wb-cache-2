2500|$|In late 2003, Tatchell {{acted as}} a press {{spokesman}} for {{the launch of the}} Zimbabwe Freedom Movement, which claimed to be a clandestine group within Zimbabwe committed to overthrowing the Mugabe government by force. The civic action support group Sokwanele urged Tatchell to check his sources, speculating that it might have been by the Zimbabwe government to justify violent action. This speculation proved to be unfounded. The Mugabe regime dismissed the ZFM as a [...] "hoax." [...] However, two Central Intelligence Organization members were spotted and turned away from the ZFM launch, as shown in the film [...] "Peter Tatchell: Just who <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is?" [...] by Max Barber.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas C. Drabick Jr. of Blacklick said in {{a letter}} to the editor {{published}} in The Dispatch [...] "He has unlimited and unfettered arrogance. Who <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> works for? Clearly, he does not believe that he is responsible to the people of Ohio; otherwise, he would not seek to keep secrets from us." [...] The Dispatch agreed, editorializing that [...] "Government decisions made in secret aren't necessarily better decisions, they're just secret decisions. [...] Unfortunately, too many of Ohio's legislative leaders seem sold on the idea that keeping things hush-hush is good." [...] Nevertheless, the Senate passed Johnson's proposal, part of the state budget, over attempts by the Democratic minority to remove the language from the bill.|$|E
2500|$|He {{said that}} he chose Lennon after seeing him {{on the cover of}} the Beatles' album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. He also {{recalled}} having listened to Lennon's John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band album in the weeks before the murder and has stated: [...] "I would listen to this music and I would get angry at him, for saying that he didn't believe in God... and that he didn't believe in the Beatles. This was another thing that angered me, even though this record had been done at least 10 years previously. I just wanted to scream out loud, 'Who <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is, saying these things about God and heaven and the Beatles?' Saying that he doesn't believe in Jesus and things like that. At that point, my mind was going through a total blackness of anger and rage. So I brought the Lennon book home, into this The Catcher in the Rye milieu where my mindset is Holden Caulfield and anti-phoniness." ...|$|E

2500|$|By summer 572, both Zu and Mu Tipo were in {{conflict}} with Hulü Guang. [...] Hulü disliked Zu, and he often complained to his generals that Zu rarely consulted military generals. [...] Once, when he was resting at a governmental building, Zu, who was blind, rode past him without realizing that Hulü was there, and never got off the horse as demanded by customs of the time. [...] Hulü angrily stated, [...] "Who <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is?" [...] Zu, realizing that Hulü disliked him, bribed Hulü's servant and asked the servant about Hulü's opinion of him. [...] The servant stated, [...] "Ever since you came into power, the Minister Prince each night sighed and stated, [...] "With a blind man in power, the empire will surely be destroyed." [...] Meanwhile, Mu had once requested to marry Hulü's daughter by a concubine, but Hulü refused. [...] Further, when Mu requested that Gao Wei grant him the public fields at Jinyang, Hulü publicly opposed the action as being detrimental to the grazing of the army's horses. [...] Zu and Mu therefore both despited Hulü. [...] They therefore fostered suspicion of Hulü in the emperor's mind, and that suspicion was exacerbated {{by the fact that}} Hulü's daughter and Gao Wei's wife Empress Hulü was not favored by Gao Wei.|$|E

500|$|Many fans on the {{internet}} were hoping that the episode would reveal whether or not Mulder is Jewish. In the episode, however, Mulder is unable to identify a Jewish book, states that <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not know Hebrew, and quips that Jesus returned from the dead. When asked whether or not Mulder is Jewish, Gordon said that <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> is, nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is [...] "even half-Jewish". <b>He</b> <b>did,</b> however, note that [...] "there's something about David [...] that could be Jewish or that has a Jewish sensibility." ...|$|R

6000|$|The clergyman {{shook his}} head, {{with a great}} concern in his face, when I told him all this; but turning quick to me upon it, said, [...] "If that be his case, you may assure him {{it is not too}} late; Christ will give him repentance. But pray," [...] says he, [...] "explain this to him, that as no man is saved but by Christ, and the merit of his passion, {{procuring}} divine mercy for him, how can it be too late for any man to receive mercy? <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is able to sin beyond the power or reach of divine mercy? Pray tell him, there may be a time when provoked mercy will no longer strive, and when God may refuse to hear; but that 'tis never too late for men to ask mercy; and we that are Christ's servants are commanded to preach mercy at all times, in the name of Jesus Christ, to all those that sincerely repent: so that 'tis never too late to repent." ...|$|E

Not only <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{suffered}} {{from a range of}} complex diseases, often at the same time – gout, scrofula and epilepsy among them – but he also treated himself with very different remedies, from walking and special diets (“I sacredly abstain from Tea, which turns acid in my stomach”) to “wonder” drugs, the most wonderful of course being none other than opium itself. On top of this, he commented on his health profusely in his letter [...] ...|$|R

Of course Osmond's a gentleman; his own sister needn't be reminded of that. But <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> can marry any girl he happens to pick out? Osmond's a gentleman, of course; but I must say I've NEVER, no, no, never, seen any one of Osmond's pretensions! What they're all founded on is more than I can say. I'm his own sister; I might be supposed to know. Who is he, if you please? What has he ever done?

One's parents were charming people of course; but so were yours, I've no doubt. Every one's a charming person nowadays. Even I'm a charming person; don't laugh, it has literally been said.

60|$|Matter is a far-fetched theory, and materialism {{is without}} a root in man. To him {{everything}} {{is important in}} the degree to which it moves him. The telegraph wires and posts, the electricity speeding from clerk to clerk, the clerks, the glad or sorrowful import of the message, and the paper on which it is finally brought to him at home, are all equally facts, all equally exist for man. A word or a thought can wound him as acutely as a knife of steel. If he thinks he is loved, he will rise up and glory to himself, although he be in a distant land and short of necessary bread. <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is not loved?--he may have the woman at his beck, and there is not a joy for him in all the world. Indeed, if we are to make any account of this figment of reason, the distinction between material and immaterial, we shall conclude that the life of each man as an individual is immaterial, although the continuation and prospects of mankind as a race turn upon material conditions. The physical business of each man's body is transacted for him; like a sybarite, he has attentive valets in his own viscera; he breathes, he sweats, he digests without an effort, or so much as a consenting volition; for the most part he even eats, not with a wakeful consciousness, but as it were between two thoughts. His life is centred among other and more important considerations; touch him in his honour or his love, creatures of the imagination which attach him to mankind or to an individual man or woman; cross him in his piety which connects his soul with heaven; and he turns from his food, he loathes his breath, and with a magnanimous emotion cuts the knots of his existence and frees himself at a blow from the web of pains and pleasures.|$|E

6000|$|At this, the clergyman {{shook his}} head, [...] "Sir," [...] said he, [...] "pray {{tell him it}} is not too late; Christ will give him repentance, if he has {{recourse}} to the merit of his passion. <b>Does</b> <b>he</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is beyond the power of Divine mercy? There may indeed be a time when provoked mercy will no longer strive, but never too late for men to repent in this world." [...] I told Atkins every word the priest had said, who then parted from us to walk with his wife, while we discoursed with the rest. But these were very stupid in religious matters; yet all of them promised to do their endeavours to make their wives turn Christians; and upon which promises the priest married the three couple. But as Atkins was the only sincere convert and of more sense than the rest, my clergyman was earnestly inquiring after him: [...] "Sir," [...] said he, [...] "let us walk out of this labyrinth, & I dare say we shall find this poor man preaching to his wife already." [...] And indeed we found it true; for coming {{to the edge of the}} wood, we perceived Atkins and his savage wife sitting under the shade of a bush, in very earnest discourse; he pointed to the sun, to the quarters of the earth, to himself, to her, the woods, and the trees. Immediately we could perceive him start upon his feet, fall down upon his knees, and lift up both his hands; at which the tears ran down my clergyman's cheeks; but our great misfortune was, we could not hear one word that passed between them. Another time he would embrace her, wiping the tears from her eyes, kissing her with the greatest transports, and then both kneel down for some minutes together. Such raptures of joy did this confirm in my young priest, that he could scarcely contain himself: And a little after this, we observed by her motion, as frequently lifting up her hands, and laying them on her breast, that she was mightily affected with his discourse, and so they withdrew from our sight.|$|E
