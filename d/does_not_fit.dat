5|$|In the {{modified}} Hubble sequence galaxy morphological classification scheme of French astronomer Gérard de Vaucouleurs, M87 is categorized as an E0p galaxy. The E0 designation {{is used for}} an elliptical galaxy that displays no flattening—that is, it appears spherical. A 'p' suffix indicates a peculiar galaxy that <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> cleanly into the classification scheme; in this case, the peculiarity denotes {{the presence of the}} jet emerging from the core. M87 is considered a type-cD galaxy, which is a supergiant D class galaxy. The latter category, first proposed by American astronomer William W. Morgan in 1958, is a galaxy that has an elliptical-like nucleus surrounded by an extensive, dustless, diffuse envelope.|$|E
5|$|Hoshino {{thought that}} in a Victorian setting, {{long-haired}} girls tended to become the central character. After considering this, she believed a short-haired girl would stand out more and be much cuter. However, her editor wanted the character to have long hair, believing this would be better received by readers. As a result, Lenalee has long hair in the early chapters of the manga. Nevertheless, Hoshino took advantage of Lenalee's fight against the Level 3 Akuma to generate an impact strong enough to cause her to lose some of her hair in the process. Hoshino paid the most attention to Lenalee's uniform wanting to design clothing that would be sexually appealing. As a result, her uniform included a mini-skirt. However, Hoshino notes that the design <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> with the manga's setting and states that {{it is best to}} treat Lenalee's uniform as fan service.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{studies on}} the sail of Dimetrodon and other sphenacodontids support Haack's 1986 {{contention}} that the sail was poorly adapted to releasing heat and maintaining a stable body temperature. The presence of sails in small-bodied species of Dimetrodon such as D.milleri and D.teutonis <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> {{the idea that the}} sail's purpose was thermoregulation because smaller sails are less able to transfer heat and because small bodies can absorb and release heat easily on their own. Moreover, close relatives of Dimetrodon such as Sphenacodon have very low crests that would have been useless as thermoregulatory devices. The large sail of Dimetrodon is thought to have developed gradually from these smaller crests, meaning that over most of the sail's evolutionary history, thermoregulation could not have served an important function.|$|E
5|$|The {{period from}} 1480 to 1482 has puzzled biographers; {{contradictory}} evidence exists suggesting either that Josquin {{was still in}} France, or {{was already in the}} service of the Sforza family, specifically with Ascanio Sforza, who had been banished from Milan and resided temporarily in Ferrara or Naples. Residence in Ferrara in the early 1480s could explain the Missa Hercules dux Ferrariae, composed for Ercole d'Este, but which stylistically <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> with the usual date of 1503–4 when Josquin was known to be in Ferrara. Alternatively it has been suggested that Josquin spent some of that time in Hungary, based on a mid-16th-century Roman document describing the Hungarian court in those years, and including Josquin as one of the musicians present.|$|E
5|$|The {{stereochemistry}} of the archaeal glycerol moiety is {{the mirror}} image of that found in other organisms. The glycerol moiety can occur in two forms that are mirror images of one another, called enantiomers. Just as a right hand <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> easily into a left-handed glove, enantiomers of one type generally cannot be used or made by enzymes adapted for the other. The archaeal phospholipids are built on a backbone of sn-glycerol-1-phosphate, which is an enantiomer of sn-glycerol-3-phosphate, the phospholipid backbone found in bacteria and eucaryotes. This suggests that archaea use entirely different enzymes for synthesizing phospholipids than do bacteria and eukaryotes. Such enzymes developed very early in life's history, indicating an early split from the other two domains.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many plants}} in {{south-west}} Western Australia, B.prionotes {{is adapted to}} {{an environment in which}} bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. B.prionotes is unusual in that it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> neatly into either of these groups. It lacks a lignotuber or thick bark, and so cannot be considered a resprouter; yet it may survive or escape some fires because of its height, the sparseness of its foliage, and because it occurs in dune swales where fire are cooler and patchier. On the other hand, it is not a typical reseeder either, because of its relatively low fire mortality rates, and because it is only weakly serotinous: although fire promotes seed release, seed release still occurs in the absence of fire.|$|E
5|$|Four {{other churches}} are {{associated}} with this tradition: St John the Baptist's Church, Chester, Old St. Paul's Cathedral, London, Bath Abbey and the destroyed Benedictine Abbey of Coventry. The collegiate church of St John in Chester was raised to cathedral status in 1075, but became a co-cathedral in 1102, when the see was removed to Coventry. The current building was probably begun {{around the time of}} the see's removal. St. Paul’s, a cathedral with a secular chapter, was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666 and was replaced by the present cathedral in the Baroque style designed by Christopher Wren. Bath Abbey was co-cathedral of the Diocese of Bath and Wells, along with Wells Cathedral. Although a large church, architecturally it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> the cathedral tradition, but has much in common with King’s College Chapel, Cambridge and St. George’s Chapel, Windsor. The abbey church at Coventry, was co-cathedral with Lichfield and St John Chester in the Diocese of Lichfield, but was destroyed at the Dissolution. The large parish church of St. Michael’s, Coventry, became Coventry Cathedral in 1918. It was bombed during World War II, leaving intact only its spire, regarded as one of the finest in England. The new Coventry Cathedral designed by Sir Basil Spence was consecrated in 1962 and adjoins the shell of the ancient church.|$|E
5|$|The first {{ionisation}} {{energy of}} hydrogen (1312.0 kJ/mol) {{is much higher}} than that of the alkali metals. As only one additional electron is required to fill in the outermost shell of the hydrogen atom, hydrogen often behaves like a halogen, forming the negative hydride ion, and is very occasionally considered to be a halogen on that basis. (The alkali metals can also form negative ions, known as alkalides, but these are little more than laboratory curiosities, being unstable.) An argument against this placement is that formation of hydride from hydrogen is endothermic, unlike the exothermic formation of halides from halogens. The radius of the H− anion also <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>fit</b> the trend of increasing size going down the halogens: indeed, H− is very diffuse because its single proton cannot easily control both electrons. It was expected for some time that liquid hydrogen would show metallic properties; while this has been shown to not be the case, under extremely high pressures, such as those found at the cores of Jupiter and Saturn, hydrogen does become metallic and behaves like an alkali metal; in this phase, it is known as metallic hydrogen. The electrical resistivity of liquid metallic hydrogen at 3000 K is approximately equal to that of liquid rubidium and caesium at 2000 K at the respective pressures when they undergo a nonmetal-to-metal transition.|$|E
