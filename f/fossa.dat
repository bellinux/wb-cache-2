5|$|Behind the incisors and canines, {{there were}} no {{additional}} teeth in the jaw. Where teeth would be located in therocephalians that do have teeth behind the canines, there is instead a large depression, or <b>fossa,</b> {{on the side of}} the maxilla, which is also bounded below by part of the lacrimal and possibly part of the jugal. This <b>fossa</b> is 48% the length of the jaw in the type specimen, and 38% in the second skull. In both skulls, this <b>fossa</b> is divided into two parts: a shallower ridge on top, and a larger and deeper depression on the bottom. A wide furrow beginning behind the canine contacts the bottom of the <b>fossa</b> and then passes into the interior of the mouth. The bottom portion of the <b>fossa</b> is strongly pitted and bears a small opening, or foramen, on both the front and back surfaces.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} hypothesis {{suggested by}} Benoit et al. involves {{some kind of}} sensory organ occupying the maxillary <b>fossa.</b> Uniquely among therapsids, the canal within the maxilla is exposed {{on the back side}} of the maxillary <b>fossa,</b> which implies that the canal, carrying the trigeminal nerve, would probably have extended across the <b>fossa,</b> outside of the outline of the skull. Benoit et al. hypothesized that the <b>fossa</b> may have supported a specialized sensory organ analogous to the pit organ of pit vipers and some other snakes, or alternatively a ganglion of nerve cells. It is also possible that this organ functioned as a replacement for the parietal eye in Euchambersia, like the pit organ does in pit vipers. However, such an expanded sensory organ would be unprecedented among tetrapods, and the few other therocephalians that also lack a parietal eye do not have a maxillary <b>fossa</b> either. Thus, Benoit et al. considered the venom hypothesis as being more plausible.|$|E
5|$|An extinct {{relative}} of the <b>fossa</b> was described in 1902 from subfossil remains and recognized as a separate species, Cryptoprocta spelea, in 1935. This species was larger than the living <b>fossa</b> (with a body mass estimate roughly twice as great), but otherwise similar. Across Madagascar, people distinguish two kinds of fossa—a large fosa mainty ("black fossa") and the smaller fosa mena ("reddish fossa")—and a white form {{has been reported in}} the southwest. It is unclear whether this is purely folklore or individual variation—related to sex, age or instances of melanism and leucism—or whether there is indeed more than one species of living <b>fossa.</b>|$|E

50|$|Venenosaurus had unusual lateral <b>fossae,</b> {{which looked}} like deep {{depressions}} in the outside walls of the vertebral centra. Some <b>fossae</b> are divided into two chambers by a ridge inside the depression. In most sauropods the <b>fossae</b> would form pneumatic openings leading to {{the interior of the}} centrum, rather than just being a depression. Less well-developed, but similar <b>fossae</b> are known from Cedarosaurus. <b>Fossae</b> that similarly resemble shallow depressions are known from Saltasaurus, Alamosaurus, Aeolosaurus, Gondwanatitan, and Malawisaurus. These taxa differ, however, in that their <b>fossae</b> are even shallower, lack the division into chambers, and do not extend as far into the vertebral columns as those of Venenosaurus.|$|R

5|$|Cryptoprocta spelea, {{also known}} as the giant <b>fossa,</b> is an extinct species of {{carnivore}} from Madagascar in the family Eupleridae, which is most closely related to the mongooses and includes all Malagasy carnivorans. It was first described in 1902, and in 1935 was recognized as a separate species from its closest relative, the living <b>fossa</b> (Cryptoprocta ferox). C.spelea is larger than the <b>fossa,</b> but otherwise similar. The two have not always been accepted as distinct species. When and how the larger form became extinct is unknown; there is some anecdotal evidence, including reports of very large fossas, that {{there is more than one}} surviving species.|$|E
5|$|In their {{descriptions}} of Plesiorycteropus, Lamberton and Patterson posited different {{interpretations of the}} location of the mandibular <b>fossa,</b> where the mandible (lower jaw) articulates with the cranium. MacPhee found problems with either interpretation and suggested that the true mandibular <b>fossa</b> was part of the area Lamberton identified as such, {{at the side of the}} braincase. The <b>fossa</b> is small and low, suggesting that the animal was not capable of powerful biting. At the back of this <b>fossa</b> is a pseudoglenoid proces, which is more prominent in P.germainepetterae. In P.germainepetterae but not P.madagascariensis, a small opening, perhaps the vascular foramen, is present next to the foramen ovale. The petrosal bone forms a relatively large portion of the roof of the tympanic cavity, which houses the middle ear; parts of the petrosal are more developed in P.madagascariensis. Endocasts (casts of the inside of the skull) indicate that the neopallium part of the brain was relatively small.|$|E
5|$|Prey is {{obtained}} by hunting {{either on the}} ground or in the trees. During the non-breeding season the <b>fossa</b> hunts individually, but during the breeding season hunting parties may be seen, and these may be pairs or later on mothers and young. One member of the group scales a tree and chases the lemurs from tree to tree, forcing them down to the ground where the other is easily able to capture them. The <b>fossa</b> is known to eviscerate its larger lemur prey, a trait that, along with its distinct scat, helps identify its kills. Long-term observations of the fossa's predation patterns on rainforest sifakas suggest that the <b>fossa</b> hunts in a subsection of their range until prey density is decreased, then moves on. The <b>fossa</b> has been reported to prey on domestic animals, such as goats and small calves, and especially chickens. Food taken in captivity includes amphibians, birds, insects, reptiles, and small- to medium-sized mammals.|$|E

Some <b>fossae</b> are divided into two chambers by a ridge inside the depression.

5|$|The <b>fossa</b> is a {{carnivore}} that hunts {{small to}} medium-sized animals. One of eight carnivorous species endemic to Madagascar, the <b>fossa</b> is the island's largest surviving endemic terrestrial mammal {{and the only}} predator capable of preying upon adults of all extant lemur species, the largest of which can weigh as much as 90percent {{of the weight of}} the average <b>fossa.</b> Although it is the predominant predator of lemurs, reports of its dietary habits demonstrate a wide variety of prey selectivity and specialization depending on habitat and season; diet does not vary by sex. While the <b>fossa</b> is thought to be a lemur specialist in Ranomafana National Park, its diet is more variable in other rain forest habitats.|$|E
5|$|The <b>fossa</b> was {{formally}} described by Edward Turner Bennett {{on the basis}} of a specimen from Madagascar sent by Charles Telfair in 1833. The common name is the same as the generic name of the Malagasy civet (<b>Fossa</b> fossana), but they are different species. Because of shared physical traits with civets, mongooses, and cats (Felidae), its classification has been controversial. Bennett originally placed the <b>fossa</b> as a type of civet in the family Viverridae, a classification that long remained popular among taxonomists. Its compact braincase, large eye sockets, retractable claws, and specialized carnivorous dentition have also led some taxonomists to associate it with the felids. In 1939, William King Gregory and Milo Hellman placed the <b>fossa</b> in its own subfamily within Felidae, the Cryptoproctinae. George Gaylord Simpson placed it back in Viverridae in 1945, still within its own subfamily, yet conceded it had many cat-like characteristics.|$|E

[...] Sirenum <b>Fossae</b> is 2,735 km long and was named after a classical albedo feature name. [...] Troughs on Mars like this one are called <b>Fossae.</b> Sirenum <b>Fossae</b> {{is believed to have}} formed by movement along a pair of faults causing a center section to drop down. This kind of feature is called a graben.|$|R
5|$|The {{foramen spinosum}} is a foramen through the sphenoid bone {{situated}} in the middle cranial <b>fossa.</b> It {{is one of two}} foramina in the greater wing of the sphenoid bone. The foramen ovale is one of these two cranial foramina, situated directly anterior and medial to the foramen spinosum. The spine of sphenoid falls medial and posterior to the foramen. Lateral to the foramen is the mandibular <b>fossa,</b> and posterior is the Eustachian tube.|$|E
5|$|The <b>fossa</b> has {{the most}} {{widespread}} geographical range of the Malagasy carnivores, and is generally found in low numbers throughout the island in remaining tracts of forest, preferring pristine undisturbed forest habitat. It is also encountered in some degraded forests, but in lower numbers. Although the <b>fossa</b> is found in all known forest habitats throughout Madagascar, including the western, dry deciduous forests, the eastern rainforests, and the southern spiny forests, it is seen more frequently in humid than in dry forests. This may be because the reduced canopy in dry forests provides less shade, and also because the <b>fossa</b> seems to travel more easily in humid forests. It is absent from areas with the heaviest habitat disturbance and, like most of Madagascar's fauna, from the central high plateau of the country.|$|E

5|$|The {{majority}} of the equatorial region of Vesta is sculpted {{by a series of}} concentric troughs. The largest is named Divalia <b>Fossa</b> (10–20km wide, 465km long). Despite the fact that Vesta is a one-seventh the size of the Moon, Divalia <b>Fossa</b> dwarfs the Grand Canyon. A second series, inclined to the equator, is found further north. The largest of the northern troughs is named Saturnalia <b>Fossa</b> (≈ 40km wide, > 370km long). These troughs are thought to be large-scale graben resulting from the impacts that created Rheasilvia and Veneneia craters, respectively. They are some of the longest chasms in the Solar System, nearly as long as Ithaca Chasma on Tethys. The troughs may be graben that formed after another asteroid collided with Vesta, a process that can happen only in a body that, like Vesta, is differentiated. Vesta's differentiation {{is one of the reasons}} why scientists consider it a protoplanet.|$|E
5|$|Being highly {{arboreal}} and {{the most}} frugivorous of the lemurs, they thrive only in primary forest with large fruiting trees, where they {{spend most of their}} time in the upper canopy. By spending the majority of their time in the crown of tall forest trees, they are relatively safe from predators such as the <b>fossa.</b>|$|E
5|$|Diurnal {{birds of}} prey such as the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus) are their most {{significant}} predators.

BHS were isolated in cultures from 56 (34. 2 %) of the children. BHS were more frequently recovered from the tonsillar <b>fossae</b> than from the posterior pharynx (54 vs. 47; both sites, 45; tonsillar <b>fossae</b> only, 9; posterior pharynx only, 2; P < 0. 0001). There were significantly more numerous colonies in the tonsillar <b>fossae</b> than in the posterior pharynx (p < 0. 01).

40|$|Two old volcano-tectonic {{collapse}} {{structures are}} exposed north and {{northeast of the}} huge shield volcano, Olympus Mons. They are semicircular and were probably low shield volcanoes similar to Alba Patera, but whose central portions have subsided or collapsed. They form the basement upon which younger volcanic materials of Alba Patera Olympus Mons have been emplaced. The oldest structure, Acheron <b>Fossae</b> is over 700 km across and is north of Olympus Mons. It has a surface of considerable relief broken by graben and extensive en echelon and parallel fractures and faults with varied displacements. Acheron <b>Fossae</b> is the most densely cratered in the Olympus Mons region. The structure must have formed very early in martian time. The second is Halex <b>Fossae,</b> northeast of Olympus Mons. Where exposed, it is cut {{by a series of}} arcuate grabens that become closer spaced toward its center. The radii of the fractures indicate that the structure may be at least 250 km across and centered beneath the Olympus Plains. Lava flows appear to have issued from some of the arcuate fractures and to have flowed radially away from the center of Halex <b>Fossae.</b> North of Halex <b>Fossae,</b> material of the same age as Halex <b>Fossae</b> overlaps Acheron <b>Fossae...</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1993, Géraldine Veron and François Catzeflis {{published}} a DNA hybridization study {{suggesting that the}} <b>fossa</b> was {{more closely related to}} mongooses (family Herpestidae) than to cats or civets. However, in 1995, Veron's morphological study once again grouped it with Felidae. In 2003, molecular phylogenetic studies using nuclear and mitochondrial genes by Anne Yoder and colleagues showed that all native Malagasy carnivorans share a common ancestry that excludes other carnivores (meaning they form a clade, making them monophyletic) and are most closely related to Asian and African Herpestidae. To reflect these relationships, all Malagasy carnivorans are now placed in a single family, Eupleridae. Within Eupleridae, the <b>fossa</b> is placed in the subfamily Euplerinae along with the falanouc (Eupleres goudoti) and Malagasy civet, but its exact relationships are poorly resolved.|$|E
5|$|Predation in {{the wild}} appears to be very rare for ruffed lemurs, {{probably}} because living in the high canopy makes them challenging to catch. Evidence of predation by raptors, such as the Henst's goshawk (Accipiter henstii) suggests it occurs at a low rate. The <b>fossa</b> (Cryptoprocta ferox) could present a potential risk if it found an individual lower in the forest canopy, but no confirmation has been presented to indicate that they prey upon ruffed lemurs. Instead, only re-introduced, captive-bred ruffed lemurs {{have been killed by}} <b>fossa,</b> likely due to their inexperience with predators. Nesting behavior poses the biggest risk of predation, making them susceptible to carnivorous mammals, such as the ring-tailed mongoose (Galidia elegans) and brown-tailed mongoose (Salanoia concolor).|$|E
5|$|The incisive {{foramina}} (openings in {{the front}} part of the palate) are short and do not reach between the first molars; they are longer in H.alfaroi. The bony palate is long and extends beyond {{the end of the}} molar row and the back margin of the maxillary bones. The posterolateral palatal pits, which perforate the palate near the third molars, are small, and {{may or may not be}} recessed into a <b>fossa.</b> The sphenopalatine vacuities (openings in the roof of the mesopterygoid <b>fossa,</b> behind the palate) are also small, as are the auditory bullae. As in most oryzomyines, the subsquamosal fenestra, an opening at the back of the skull, is present. The pattern of grooves and foramina (openings) in the skull indicates that the circulation of the arteries of the head in T.talamancae follows the primitive pattern, as in most similar species but unlike in Hylaeamys.|$|E
30|$|The {{southern}} part of Memnonia <b>Fossae,</b> {{one of the largest}} graben systems that radially extended from the Tharsis rise, traverses the basin from east to west, where dike intrusions and associated melting of cryosphere may have occurred along these faults (Wilson and Head 2002), which is supported by the presence of Mangala Valles, the major outflow channel sourced from the northern Memnonia <b>Fossae.</b> Cross-cutting relationship between Memnonia <b>Fossae</b> and the basin shows the activity of Memnonia <b>Fossae</b> followed the basin formation. Wrinkle ridges, with N-S trending axis observed around this region, indicate the circum-Tharsis W-E compressional fields (Head et al. 2002), possibly associated with the Tharsis rise formation on global scale.|$|R
