In TouchTone, the player monitors phone calls as part of a government surveillance program to find public threats.

5|$|Whereas Milian's {{previous}} albums had pop and R stylings, she {{was encouraged}} by Island Def <b>Jam</b> <b>to</b> target a new audience and release an urban record. Explaining the change, Milian {{said that one of}} her main problems was that previous releases would often find mainstream success, but would be relatively unsuccessful on urban radio. As an R artist, she wanted to build her core audience–a true fan base that would support her through time–to increase her career's longevity. The main purpose of her genre change was {{to go back to the}} streets and add to her core audience.|$|E

Under Mamluk rule, Nablus possessed running water, many Turkish bathes and exported olive oil and soap to Egypt, Syria, the Hejaz, several Mediterranean islands, and the Arabian Desert. The city's olive oil was also used in the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus.

40|$|Game jams {{are social}} events {{involving}} {{the integration of}} various game making disciplines (e. g. programming, art, design) to make games under constraints, such as a short fixed time. Game jams are emerging {{in areas such as}} re-search, education, and industry as events to facilitate game making for designed outcomes; i. e. outcomes elicited from appropriately designed game jams. Game <b>jams</b> continue <b>to</b> grow and be appropriated to new contexts, however, little is known about how <b>to</b> design game <b>jams</b> <b>to</b> facilitate designed outcomes. We identify participation in game jams as a con-structive form of play defined as ludic craft. Consequently, we investigate the properties (e. g. rules) of game jams un-der the lens of play on the playful vs. gameful continuum. Reflecting on our experiences as facilitators and participants of jams in indie, industry, and academic contexts, we have derived a set of guidelines for game <b>jams</b> <b>to</b> facilitate ludic craft in its playful and gameful forms.

500|$|The {{group also}} held an improvisational {{approach}} to live performances, which connected the band with jam band culture.

[...] "We sure didn’t set out to be a [...] "jam band" [...] but those long jams just emanated from within the band, because we didn’t want to just play three minutes and be over," [...] said Allman.

Rubin's production credit on the back cover reads [...] "REDUCED BY RICK RUBIN", referring to his minimalist production style, which gave the album its stripped-down and gritty sound. This style would serve as one of Rubin's production trademarks and would have {{a great impact on}} future hip-hop productions.

[...] Other comments on the show's aesthetics were mostly positive. Staff of GamesRadar admitted, [...] "At least the song fits. Can't imagine Sonic listening to Undergrounds wailing Meat Loaf light rock, but he'd definitely <b>jam</b> <b>to</b> Sonic X." [...] Jones praised the rock music from Sonic Adventure 1 and 2, {{as well as the}} [...] "pretty piano music" [...] and [...] "catchy" [...] Japanese intro and outro themes.

The first show following the release of Blood Sugar Sex Magik was at the Oscar Mayer Theater in Madison, Wisconsin, which was met with positive reactions from the Milwaukee Journal: [...] "the audience was a swirling mass of airborne cups, ice cubes, shoes, shirts, pogo dancers, body-passers and stage divers. And it wasn't purely a boy's club in the moshpit—many females bought into the mayhem, stripping down to their bras and flinging themselves about madly as the band tore through 'Higher Ground', 'Suck My Kiss', and 'Give it Away', which was Goth-ed up by Frusciante when he added a riff from Black Sabbath's 'Sweet Leaf'." ...|$|E

During this time, the two also worked separately, and Wohlwend released the well-received Threes with Asher Vollmer in 2014. Wohlwend tried to fit audio signal elements into TouchTone nascent theme of light, lasers, and prisms.

The single was a hard-hitting, streetwise b-boy song with spare beats and ballistic rhymes. Smith later discussed his search for a label, stating [...] "I sent my demo to many different companies, but it was Def Jam where I found my home." [...] That same year, Smith made his professional debut concert performance at Manhattan Center High School. In a later interview, LL Cool J recalled the experience, stating [...] "They pushed the lunch room tables together and me and my DJ, Cut Creator, started playing.... As soon as it was over there were girls screaming and asking for autographs. Right then and there I said 'This is what I want to do'." [...] LL's debut single sold over 100,000 copies and helped establish both Def Jam as a label and Smith as a rapper. The commercial success of [...] "I Need a Beat", along with the Beastie Boys' single [...] "Rock Hard" [...] (1984), helped lead Def <b>Jam</b> <b>to</b> a distribution deal with Columbia Records the following year.|$|E
500|$|A {{follow-up}} compilation, The Lost Tapes 2, {{was originally}} intended to be released on December 16, 2003, and include unreleased recordings, remixes, and freestyle tracks. However, its release was delayed, and in 2006, Nas signed to Def Jam Recordings. In a June 2010 interview for Hot 97.5 KVEG, he said of following-up The Lost Tapes, [...] "I do {{got a lot of}} songs that really didn't make no album, that's just sittin' around [...] got lost. So I've got enough actually, for a Lost Tapes 2 and 3 by now. So I've just got to set it up, put them together – 12 songs for one album, 12 songs for another album, and figure it out. That's all it takes." [...] In September, he announced plans to release The Lost Tapes 2 on December 14. However, its release was further delayed by Def Jam, whom Nas accused of mishandling the project and its budget in a personal e-mail sent to label executives. Reports of the project's delay incited fans to create an online petition in December asking for Def <b>Jam</b> <b>to</b> release the album.
