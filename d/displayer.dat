It involves the animal spreading his thighs and having an erect penis. Dominant males display to submissive males to emphasize their higher status. The dominant males direct their action to {{the face of the}} passive males, and the act can be done with the <b>displayer</b> leaning over the passive monkey or the <b>displayer</b> doing the action from a distance in a more upright position. This form of dominance interaction, as well as several types of aggression, increase during the mating season when males want to emphasize their rank and strength and gain more control over other males in relation to access to females. Genital displays may also define male-male alliances when the males participate in [...] "joint genital displays".|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Social {{networking}} sites (SNSs) form {{increasingly popular}} venues for adolescents {{to express their}} developing identity, including their sexual self. This study investigated how {{and to what extent}} early and middle adolescents display sexuality and romance on SNSs and the demographic and psychosexual factors associated with their displays. Methods: Dutch adolescents aged 11 - 18 years were recruited and Facebook friended. Participants' Facebook profiles were evaluated for sexual and romantic references and Facebook engagement. Participants completed a digital questionnaire measuring constructs related to romantic and sexual development. Analyses included chi-square and Student's t-tests. Results: A total of 104 adolescents (M age = 15. 01, 68. 3 % female) were Facebook friended. Of 104 profiles, 25 (24. 0 %) contained 67 sexual references, and 27 (26. 0 %) contained 204 romantic references. Sexual references were mostly posted by others and referring to others or to no one in particular, whereas romantic references were predominantly posted by and referring to the profile owner. <b>Displayers</b> of sexual and romantic references were, compared with nondisplayers, older, more engaged in Facebook, more sexually experienced, and perceived more of their peers as approving of sex and as sexually active. In addition, sexual <b>displayers</b> were more likely boys and more sexually interested. There were no differences with respect to sexual intention and sexual attitudes. Conclusions: A minority of young adolescents display sexual and romantic references on SNSs. References may reflect adolescents' offline sexual and romantic experiences. Yet, they may be powerful in creating behavioral norms; therefore, guidance on interpreting and displaying such messages should be promoted. © 2014 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine...|$|R

First we explore the notion of cultures and its relevance for applications with a VH. Then we give a general scheme of designing emotional facial expressions, and identify the stages where a human is involved, either as a real person with some specific role, or as a VH displaying facial expressions. We discuss how the display and the emotional meaning of facial expressions may be measured in objective ways, and how the culture of <b>displayers</b> and the judges may influence the process of analyzing human facial expressions and evaluating synthesized ones. We review psychological experiments on cross-cultural perception of emotional facial expressions. By identifying the culturally critical issues of data collection and interpretation with both real and VHs, we aim at providing a methodological reference and inspiration for further research. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: Social {{dominance}} and physical size are closely linked. Nonverbal dominance displays in many non-human species {{are known to}} increase the displayer’s apparent size. Humans also employ a variety of nonverbal cues that increase apparent status, {{but it is not}} yet known whether these cues function via a similar mechanism: by increasing the displayer’s apparent size. Methodology/Principal Finding: We generated stimuli in which actors displayed high status, neutral, or low status cues that were drawn from the findings of a recent meta-analysis. We then conducted four studies that indicated that nonverbal cues that increase apparent status do so by increasing the perceived size of the <b>displayer.</b> Experiment 1 demonstrated that nonverbal status cues affect perceivers ’ judgments of physical size. The results of Experiment 2 showed that altering simple perceptual cues can affect judgments of both size and perceived status. Experiment 3 used objective measurements to demonstrate that status cues change targets ’ apparent size in the two-dimensional plane visible to a perceiver, and Experiment 4 showed that changes in perceived size mediate changes in perceived status, and that the cue most associated with this phenomenon is postural openness. Conclusions/Significance: We conclude that nonverbal cues associated with social dominance also affect the perceived size of the <b>displayer.</b> This suggests that certain nonverbal dominance cues in humans may function as they do in other species...|$|E

The concept of streaming server system that has many sources is called the Multi-source Streaming Server (MSS). To be able to enjoy video streaming from the MSS system is required a terminal access. This terminal access has several sections, that is de-encapsulator, demultiplexer, and <b>displayer</b> block. MSS concept which has several streaming server, before transmit the AV stream will advance to multiplexing AV streams from several streaming server that will be transmitted to the same one link. So one packet AV stream has some AV streams from several streaming servers. <b>Displayer</b> is a video streaming player application that will be designed using the Java Media Framework (JMF). In general, video streaming players applications has facilities like play, pause, and stop, so this application will have the same facilities. Because the MSS system has a lot of streaming servers, then this player application has additional facilities to choose video streaming from streaming server that the user want. The result of this project is a video streaming player application where the user can specify the options which video that user want to see from selected streaming server, and users who view the videos get better video quality.
