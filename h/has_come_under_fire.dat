25|$|The anthem <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>fire</b> from {{critics who}} charge that its {{language}} is archaic {{and does not}} appeal {{to a new generation}} of Belizeans who are in any case too young to remember Samuel Haynes.|$|E
25|$|Other animators {{have criticized}} the show as well. The show's {{animation}} <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>fire</b> by Ren & Stimpy creator John Kricfalusi, who expresses concern that the simplistic animation of Family Guy will negatively impact {{the new wave of}} content creators.|$|E

25|$|Several private {{organizations}}, {{the most}} notable being the Boy Scouts of America, do not allow atheist members. However, this policy <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>fire</b> by organizations who assert that the Boy Scouts of America do benefit from taxpayer money and thus cannot be called a truly private organization, and thus must admit atheists, and others currently barred from membership. An organization called Scouting for All, founded by Eagle Scout Steven Cozza, {{is at the forefront}} of the movement.|$|E
25|$|Transparency of {{information}} is another factor defining a delivery system. Access to information on conditions, treatments, quality, and pricing greatly affects the choice by patients/consumers and, therefore, the incentives of medical professionals. While the US healthcare system <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>fire</b> for lack of openness, new legislation may encourage greater openness. There is a perceived tension between the need for transparency {{on the one hand}} and such issues as patient confidentiality and the possible exploitation {{of information}} for commercial gain on the other.|$|E
25|$|Sakhalin II <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>fire</b> from {{environmental}} groups, namely Sakhalin Environment Watch, for dumping dredging material in Aniva Bay. The groups were also {{worried about the}} offshore pipelines interfering with the migration of whales off the island. The consortium has (as of January 2006) re-routed the pipeline to avoid the whale migration. After a doubling in the projected cost, the Russian government threatened to halt the project for environmental reasons. There have been suggestions that the Russian government is using the environmental issues as a pretext for obtaining {{a greater share of}} revenues from the project and/or forcing involvement by the state-controlled Gazprom. The cost overruns (at least partly due to Shell's response to environmental concerns), are reducing the share of profits flowing to the Russian treasury.|$|E

25|$|This {{album is}} filled with {{feelings}} of lethargy, languor and disengagement, yet most of the tracks sound warm and sweet, {{as opposed to those}} piquant self-centered ones before her motherhood. Reporters noticed that she began to smile more often in public and was not as icy or aloof as before. However, the album was released during the Asian financial crisis which swept East and Southeast Asia. Wong's old company Cinepoly, which retains the copyright on her previous records, released a Mandarin compilation {{at the same time in}} 1997 to counteract her new EMI album (and indeed outperformed it). Later, Cinepoly would release two compilations each year to compete with Faye's new releases, a tactic which <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>fire</b> from her international fans. Faye Wong did not sell well in Hong Kong, but did quite well in Taiwan and mainland China. Although Wong had garnered some popularity with her 4 previous Mandarin albums, it was really this sweet yet slightly alternative album which had the Mainland Chinese audience listening. Her profile began to rise sharply in Asia.|$|E
25|$|In the United States {{securities}} industry, arbitration {{has long}} been the preferred method of resolving disputes between brokerage firms, and between firms and their customers. The securities industry uses a pre-dispute arbitration agreement, where the parties agree to arbitrate their disputes before any such dispute arises. Those agreements were upheld by the United States Supreme Court in Shearson v. MacMahon, 482 U.S. 220 (1987) and today nearly all disputes involving brokerage firms, other than Securities class action claims, are resolved in arbitration. The SEC <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>fire</b> from members of the Senate Judiciary Committee for not fulfilling statutory duty to protect individual investors, because all brokers require arbitration, and arbitration does not provide a court-supervised discovery process, require arbitrators to follow rules of evidence or result in written opinions establishing precedence, or case law, or provide the efficiency gains it once did. Arbitrator selection bias, hidden conflicts of interest, and a case where an arbitration panel refused to follow instructions handed down from a judge, were also raised as issues. The final result in the case where the arbitrators were in contempt of court is unknown; it was settled out of court under settlement agreement terms that, at the broker's insistence, are confidential.|$|E
500|$|On July 22, 2005, in {{response}} to bombings in London, the New York City Transit Police introduced a new policy of randomly searching passengers' bags as they approached turnstiles. The NYPD claimed that no form of racial profiling would be conducted when these searches actually took place. The NYPD <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>fire</b> from some groups that claim purely random searches without any form of threat assessment would be ineffectual. Donna Lieberman, Executive Director of the NYCLU, stated, [...] "This NYPD bag search policy is unprecedented, unlawful and ineffective. It is essential that police be aggressive in maintaining security in public transportation. But our very real concerns about terrorism do not justify the NYPD subjecting millions of innocent people to suspicionless searches {{in a way that}} does not identify any person seeking to engage in terrorist activity and is unlikely to have any meaningful deterrent effect on terrorist activity." [...] The searches were upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in MacWade v. Kelly.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, a theatre {{group in}} Germany <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>fire</b> for {{allowing}} a white actor to paint {{his face and}} take {{the part of the}} black character Midge Carter on stage. This was not an isolated case.|$|R
50|$|Many campaigns <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>fire</b> {{through their}} alleged use of pseudoscience and their {{promotion}} of unrealistic goals.

50|$|USA Today {{reported}} that the WGA’s charity seal program <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>fire.</b> The WGA licenses its seal to charities that meet its 20 standards of accountability at rates from $1,000 to $15,000 annually. This income provides 67 percent of the WGA’s budget.|$|R
500|$|The {{academic}} costume worn by graduates {{consists of}} a gown, hood, and cap. Graduates have short pointed sleeves and a three-foot hood lined with the college's blue and white colors. Honor cords or sashes {{are not allowed to}} be worn during the ceremony; this rule <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>fire</b> in recent years. Dress of the faculty differs from the graduates as the colors of their caps and gowns are dependent on the professors' alma mater. The Saint Anselm College Mace was hand carved from black walnut, and designed and executed by the Trappist monks of St. Joseph's Abbey. One of its striking features is the cross surmounting the mace, which is patterned after the cross of Saint Anselm Abbey Church; another is the seal of the college, mounted on the round head of the mace. Encircling the shield is the legend Sigillum Collegii Sancti Anselmi - 1889, meaning [...] "Seal of Saint Anselm College". The diploma measures 16" [...] x 19" [...] and is written in Latin. The following is a translation of the Latin text which appears on the diploma.|$|E

50|$|Blow's {{producers}} <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>fire</b> {{from parents}} and other concerned parties, who allege that its marketing targets adolescents and glorifies illegal drug abuse, citing the use of rock music and women in seductive poses on the drink's website, {{as well as the}} inclusion of a Myspace link.|$|R
50|$|Many {{pharmaceutical}} marketing representatives <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>fire</b> {{for offering}} free meals to doctors {{in order to}} promote new drugs.

50|$|Modeling {{and fashion}} {{industries}} <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>fire</b> {{in recent years}} for embracing and promoting an ultra-thin appearance.

Many models have died due to complications from their dangerously underweight bodies, including Isabelle Caro.|$|R
2500|$|Allen himself <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>fire</b> {{for similar}} attitudes he {{supported}} regarding the Virginia Military Institute.

A 2000 candidate-guide published by the Virginian-Pilot reiterated this stance of Allen's.|$|E

2500|$|Since 1975, Greece {{has been}} {{restoring}} the Acropolis. This restoration has included replacing {{the thousands of}} rusting iron clamps and supports {{that had previously been}} used, with non-corrosive titanium rods; removing surviving artwork from the building into storage and subsequently into a new museum built specifically for the display of the Parthenon art; and replacing the artwork with high-quality replicas. This process <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>under</b> <b>fire</b> from some groups as some buildings have been completely dismantled, including the dismantling of the Temple of Athena Nike and for the unsightly nature of the site due to the necessary cranes and scaffolding. But the hope is to restore the site to some of its former glory, which may take another 20 years and 70 million euros, though the prospect of the Acropolis being [...] "able to withstand the most extreme weather conditions– earthquakes" [...] is [...] "little consolation to the tourists visiting the Acropolis" [...] according to The Guardian. Directors of the British Museum have not ruled out a temporary loan to the new museum, but state that it would be under the condition of Greece acknowledging British ownership.|$|E
