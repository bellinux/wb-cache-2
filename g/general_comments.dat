500|$|The first {{histories}} of Edward in the 16th and 17th centuries drew {{primarily on the}} works of the chroniclers, and made little use of the official records of the period. They limited themselves to <b>general</b> <b>comments</b> on Edward's significance as a monarch, and echoed the chroniclers' praise for his accomplishments. During the 17th century, the lawyer Edward Coke wrote extensively about Edward's legislation, terming the King the [...] "English Justinian", after the renowned Byzantine lawmaker, JustinianI. Later in the century, historians used the available record evidence to address the role of parliament and kingship under Edward, drawing comparisons between his reign and the political strife of their own century. 18th-century historians established a picture of Edward as an able, if ruthless, monarch, conditioned by the circumstances of his own time.|$|E

40|$|<b>General</b> <b>Comment</b> No. 17 on authors’ {{rights is}} a {{comprehensive}} assessment of the normative content of article 15, paragraph 1 (c) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (the Covenant). Also, the obligations and violations are spelled out in great detail. It is found that the <b>General</b> <b>Comment</b> makes a clear distinction in principle between standard intellectual property rights and the protection given in accordance with article 15, paragraph 1 (c). At the same time, the <b>General</b> <b>Comment</b> does not outline any specific tools for determining when an intellectual effort would result in human rights protection and when it would fall outside {{of the scope of}} this protection. Two clarifications have resulted in a positive reception of the <b>General</b> <b>Comment</b> among those who expressed criticism during the drafting. First, <b>General</b> <b>Comment</b> No. 17 acknowledges the need for human rights protection for local and indigenous communities. Second, <b>General</b> <b>Comment</b> No. 17 emphasizes the balance between the private interests of the authors and the other human rights recognized in the Covenant...|$|R
