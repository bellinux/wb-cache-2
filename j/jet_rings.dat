40|$|The cooling {{arrangement}} of the Space Shuttle Main Engine High Pressure Oxidizer Turbopump (HPOTP) incorporates two <b>jet</b> <b>rings,</b> each of which produces 19 high-velocity coolant jets. At some operating conditions, the frequency of excitation associated with the 19 jets coincides with the natural frequency of the turbine blades, contributing to fatigue cracking of blade shanks. In this paper, an alternate turbine disk cooling arrangement, applicable to disk faces of zero hub radius, is evaluated, which consists of a single coolant jet impinging {{at the center of}} the turbine disk. Results of the CFD analysis show that replacing the jet ring with a single central coolant jet in the HPOTP leads to an acceptable thermal environment at the disk rim. Based on the predictions of flow and temperature fields for operating conditions, the single central jet cooling system was recommended for implementation into the development program of the Technology Test Bed Engine at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center...|$|E

The electron gun, interaction region boundary rings and the magnetic field are aligned precisely to keep the projectile beam on the axis of the apparatus when the interaction potential is changed. Any change in overlap of the electron beam and the jet leads to changing count rates. In the aligned setup, this effect was negligible for scanning amplitudes up to 2 V.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we would}} {{look into the}} theory of {{arithmetic}} jet spaces and its application in modular forms. The arithmetic jet spaces {{can be thought of}} as an analogue of jet spaces in differential algebra. In the case of arithmetic jet spaces, a derivation is replaced by p-derivation. This theory was initiated by A. Buium in char. The results in the first chapter are concerning the connection between arithmetic jet spaces and Witt vectors. Let R = _p^ur be the p-adic completion of the maximal unramified extension of _p. If A is an R-algebra and we denote J^nA its n-th jet ring. Firstly, we show the adjunction property which says that the arithmetic jet functor from rings to rings is the left adjoint of the Witt vector functor. This property was also shown by Borger in jim 2. However, we give an explicit proof of this fact and the highlight of this proof is the construction of a ring homomorphism P:A W_n(J^nA) which is the analogue to the exponential map :A A[t]/(t^n+ 1) given by (a) = ∑_i= 0 ^n ∂^i a/i! t^i. If we denote by D_n(B) := B[t]/(t^n+ 1) then we show that there is a family of ring homomorphisms indexed by α∈ B^n+ 1, Ψ_α: D_ 1 ∘W_n(B) W_n ∘D_ 1 (B) for any ring B and n. This gives yields the relation between a usual derivation ∂ and a p-derivation given by ∂x̣ = p ∂̣x + (∂ x) ^p - x^p- 1 ∂ x. This interaction is used to analyse the ring homomorphisms η : TJ^nA J^nTA where T associates the tangent ring to the ring A. In the second chapter of the thesis, we apply the theory of arithmetic jet spaces to modular forms. Let M denote the ring of modular forms over an affine open embedding X ⊂ X_ 1 (N) where X_ 1 (N) is the modular curve that parametrises elliptic curves and level N structures on it. Let M^∞ be the direct limit of the <b>jet</b> <b>rings</b> of M which we call the ring of -modular forms. Then from the universality property of jet spaces, there are ring homomorphism E^n: M^n R((q)) ^[q', [...] ., q^(n) ]^ which are prolongation of the given Fourier expansion map E:M R((q)). Hence E^n is the -Fourier expansion of M^∞. Denote by S^∞ = _n Im(E^n). If S^∞ denote the reduction mod p of S^∞ then, one of our main results says that S^∞ can be realised as an Artin-Schrier extension over S^∞ where S is the coordinate ring of X. If we set all the indeterminates q'= [...] =q^(n) = 0 then we obtain a ring homomorphism M^∞W where W is the ring of generalised p-adic modular forms. Our next result shows that the image of the above homomorphism is p-adically dense in W. We also classify the kernel of this homomorphism which is the p-adic closure of the -ideal (f^∂ - 1, f^ 1, (̣f^∂ - 1), f̣^ 1, [...] .,) where f^∂ and f^ 1 are -modular forms with weights. This should be viewed as -analogue of the Theorem of Swinnerton-Dyer and Serre where the Fourier expansion over F_p of the modular forms has the kernel (E_p- 1 - 1), E_p- 1 is the Hasse invariant. In the third chapter, we take the step to understand the `-Fourier expansion principle' and the action of the Hecke operators on the Fourier expansion of differential modular forms. We work on k[[q]][q'] which is the reduction mod p of R[[q]]^[q']^, the "holomorphic subspace" of R((q)) ^[q']^. The definition of the Hecke operators away from the prime p extends naturally from the classical definition of Hecke operators. At the prime p, we define T_κ(p) on a "-symmetric subspace" of -modular forms using the definition of A. Buium introduced in eigen. Our main result states that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the classical cusp forms which are eigenvectors of all Hecke operators with "primitive" -modular forms whose -Fourier series lies in k[[q]][q'] and are eigenvectors of all Hecke operators. This chapter should be viewed as the first attempt to understand the structure of eigenforms on the Fourier side of -modular forms. Ph. D. DoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.

The leading models invoke either (1) a roughly uniform jet with sharp edges or (2) a jet {{with a narrow}} core and wide wings where the energy per solid angle drops as a power law with the angle from the jet symmetry axis. Recently, a two-component jet model has also been considered, with a narrow uniform jet of initial Lorentz factor 0 k 100 surrounded by a wider uniform jet with 0 10 30. Some models predict more exotic jet profiles, such as a thin uniform ring (i. e., the outflow is bounded by two concentric cones of half-opening angle c and c þ, with Tc) or a fan (a thin outflow with T 1 along the rotational equator, c / 2 þ/ 2). In this paper we calculate the expected afterglow light curves from such jet structures, using a simple formalism that is developed here for this purpose and could also have other applications. These light curves are qualitatively compared to observations of GRB after-glows.

As application of the DIC technique might result in additional cleaning potential for accelerator structures, {{an extension of the}} set-up and testing of nine-cell cavities is planned until mid of 2008. Furthermore, DIC was applied to the copper injector "gun " cavity for TTF/FLASH [1] recently. In order to reduce the dark current of the gun cavity, a vertical cleaning setup was developed and tested...|$|R
60|$|Esther was a Frenchwoman, who {{had lived}} with 'Madame', as she called her mistress, for many years, and who rather tyrannized over the old lady, who could not get along without her. Her real name was Estelle, but Aunt March ordered her to change it, and she obeyed, on {{condition}} that she was never asked to change her religion. She took a fancy to Mademoiselle, and amused her very much with odd stories {{of her life in}} France, when Amy sat with her while she got up Madame's laces. She also allowed her to roam about the great house, and examine the curious and pretty things stored away in the big wardrobes and the ancient chests, for Aunt March hoarded like a magpie. Amy's chief delight was an Indian cabinet, full of queer drawers, little pigeonholes, and secret places, in which were kept all sorts of ornaments, some precious, some merely curious, all more or less antique. To examine and arrange these things gave Amy great satisfaction, especially the jewel cases, in which on velvet cushions reposed the ornaments which had adorned a belle forty years ago. There was the garnet set which Aunt March wore when she came out, the pearls her father gave her on her wedding day, her lover's diamonds, the <b>jet</b> mourning <b>rings</b> and pins, the queer lockets, with portraits of dead friends and weeping willows made of hair inside, the baby bracelets her one little daughter had worn, Uncle March's big watch, with the red seal so many childish hands had played with, and in a box all by itself lay Aunt March's wedding ring, too small now for her fat finger, but put carefully away like the most precious jewel of them all.|$|R
40|$|A general {{formulation}} of some effects of swirl on turbulent mixing is given. The {{basis for the}} analysis is that momentum transport is enhanced by turbulence resulting from rotational instability of the fluid field. An appropriate form for the turbulent eddy viscosity is obtained by mixing length type arguments. The result {{takes the form of}} a corrective factor that is a function of the swirl and acts to increase the eddy viscosity. The factor is based upon the initial mixing conditions implying that the rotational turbulence decays in a manner similar to that of free shear turbulence. Existing experimental data for free jet combustion are adequately matched by using the modifying factor to relate the effects of swirl on eddy viscosity. The model is extended and applied to the supersonic combustion of a <b>ring</b> <b>jet</b> of hydrogen injected into a constant area annular air stream. The computations demonstrate that swirling the flow could: (1) reduce the burning length by one half, (2) result in more uniform burning across the annulus width, and (3) open the possibility of optimization of the combustion characteristics by locating the fuel jet between the inner wall and center of the annulus width...|$|R
