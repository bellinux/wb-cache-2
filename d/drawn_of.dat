500|$|The {{series has}} {{received}} mixed critical reception; About.com's Nancy Basile gave the series {{four out of}} five stars, opining that the series is [...] "what Adult Swim should be ... experimental, but in a cheap, simple, not-trying-to-be-cool way." [...] She found the crude animation [...] "refreshing" [...] but joked that the series [...] "can kill" [...] viewers not used to the slow pace. Writing for AOL TV, Adam Finley regarded the show as [...] "the most simplistically <b>drawn</b> <b>of</b> all the Adult Swim shows, and yet the most complex in terms of story." [...] He contrasted it with other Williams Street productions, finding it to [...] "instead unrave slowly, revealing {{a little bit more of}} what's underneath the surface while also piling on more and more questions." [...] Rob Mitchum of Pitchfork Media called it [...] "the asymptote of the block's crude style".|$|E
500|$|Governor Reagan's term {{ended in}} 1975, {{and he did}} not run for a third; instead, he met with advisors to discuss a {{possible}} bid for the presidency in 1976, challenging incumbent President Gerald Ford. Ronald still needed to convince a reluctant Nancy before running, however. She feared for her husband's health and his career as a whole, though she felt that he was the right man for the job and eventually approved. Nancy took on a more traditional role in the campaign, holding coffees, luncheons, and talks, with senior citizens. With that, she oversaw personnel, monitored her husband's schedule, and occasionally provided press conferences. The 1976 campaign included the so-called [...] "battle of the queens", contrasting Nancy with First Lady Betty Ford. They both spoke out {{over the course of the}} campaign on similar issues, but with different approaches. Nancy was particularly upset by the warmonger image that the Ford campaign had <b>drawn</b> <b>of</b> her husband.|$|E

500|$|Two {{segments}} later, Big Bird interrupts the adults—Maria (Sonia Manzano), David (Northern Calloway), Bob (Bob McGrath), Susan (Loretta Long), Gordon, Luis (Emilio Delgado) and Olivia (Alaina Reed Hall)—discussing {{politics by}} giving them pictures he had <b>drawn</b> <b>of</b> each of them. He gets to Mr. Hooper's picture, saying that he would {{give it to him}} when he returns. The adults tearfully and emotionally explain to Big Bird that Mr. Hooper has died and he will never come back. Big Bird reacts by getting upset, expressing his confusion and sadness. The adults reassure him that they love him and will take care of him and David reveals that he would take over the store, Mr. Hooper having left it to him in his will. Big Bird asks, [...] "Why {{does it have to be}} this way? Give me one good reason!" [...] and Gordon answers, [...] "Big Bird, it has to be this way... just because."

500|$|Before {{the twenty-first}} century, the Benedictine reform {{dominated}} history textbooks of the period, and the earlier tenth century and later eleventh received far less attention. According to Wormald: [...] "For English historians, the tenth century is above all one of [...] "Reformation", {{the enforcement of}} Benedictine observance upon the religious life". The main sources for the reform are the lives of Dunstan, Oswald and Æthelwold, and this creates the risk of exaggerating the role of these three men {{at the expense of}} the many lesser-known men who contributed to the process, and on concentrating on reformed communities at the expense of less rigorous and secular ones. The picture <b>drawn</b> <b>of</b> the reform by Æthelwold and his circle has been dominant, and historians have generally portrayed it favourably. In 2005 John Blair commented: [...] "Ecclesiastical historians' distaste for the lifestyle of secular ministers, which has become less explicit but can even now seem virtually instinctive, reflects contemporary partisanship absorbed into a historiographical tradition which has privileged the centre over the localities, and the ideals of the reformers over the realities and needs of grass-roots religious life." [...] In the twenty-first century, historians have been far more sceptical of the reformers' claims, and defended the contribution of the clerics and local churches.|$|E
