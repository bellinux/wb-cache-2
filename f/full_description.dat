5|$|Canadian {{neurologist}} C. Miller Fisher {{described the}} variant {{that bears his}} name in 1956. British neurologist Edwin Bickerstaff, based in Birmingham, described the brainstem encephalitis type in 1951 with Philip Cloake, and made further contributions with another paper in 1957. Guillain had reported on some of these features prior to their <b>full</b> <b>description</b> in 1938. Further subtypes have been described since then, such as the form featuring pure ataxia and the type causing pharyngeal-cervical-brachial weakness. The axonal subtype was first described in the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|The first <b>full</b> <b>description</b> of {{diabetic}} ketoacidosis {{is attributed}} to Julius Dreschfeld, a German pathologist working in Manchester, United Kingdom. In his description, which he gave in an 1886 lecture at the Royal College of Physicians in London, he drew on reports by Adolph Kussmaul as well as describing the main ketones, acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate, and their chemical determination. The condition remained almost universally fatal until the discovery of insulin in the 1920s; by the 1930s, mortality had fallen to 29 percent, and by the 1950s it had become less than 10 percent. The entity of cerebral edema due to DKA was described in 1936 {{by a team of}} doctors from Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Practicing correct sexual {{practices}} was one method of perfecting the body's internal spirits. The Celestial Masters believed that semen is {{the embodiment of}} qi. If someone ejaculated too often, their life would be shortened. In fact, the Xiang'er indicates that people should not even have sex {{for the purposes of}} reproduction. The Celestial Masters frowned upon the practice of heqi (also known as 'The Union of the Breaths') of not ejaculating during sex in order to 'nourish the brain', and advocated non-ejaculation simply as a way to avoid losing qi. In addition, the Celestial Masters thought that the method of stealing a woman's qi to replenish the man's own qi was completely wrong, and should not be practiced. Despite their opposition to 'heqi' and reproductive sex, there is the possibility that the Celestial Masters supported sex for purposes other than reproduction, and a Celestial Master text from around the 5th century describes an elaborate sexual ritual.See Kalinowski(1985) for a <b>full</b> <b>description</b> of the ritual.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} holotype, Russell {{designated}} a specimen collected by Barnum Brown in 1913 as the paratype of D. torosus. This specimen (AMNH 5438) consists {{of parts of}} the hindleg, the pelvis {{and some of its}} associated vertebrae. It was discovered in the Dinosaur Park Formation in Alberta. The Dinosaur Park Formation was formerly known as the Upper Oldman Formation and dates back to the middle Campanian, between 76.5 and 74.8million years ago. Daspletosaurus fossils are known specifically from the middle to upper section of the formation, between 75.6 and 75.0 million years ago. In 1914, Brown collected a nearly complete skeleton and skull; forty years later his American Museum of Natural History sold this specimen to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. It was mounted for display in Chicago and labeled as Albertosaurus libratus for many years, but after several skull features were later found to be modeled in plaster, including most of the teeth, the specimen (FMNH PR308) was reassigned to Daspletosaurus torosus by Thomas Carr in 1999. A total of eight specimens have been collected from the Dinosaur Park Formation over the years since, most of them within the boundaries of Dinosaur Provincial Park. Phil Currie believes that the Dinosaur Park specimens represent a new species of Daspletosaurus, distinguished by certain features of the skull. Pictures of this new species have been published, but it still awaits a name and <b>full</b> <b>description</b> in print.|$|E

It is thus believed to have optimal polarization vision. They are the only animals known for having dynamic polarization vision. This is achieved by rotational eye movements to maximise the polarization contrast between the object in focus and its background. Because each eye moves independently from the other, it creates two separate streams of visual information.|$|E

The roof was supported by 8 arches, which formed kamarai (apses or niches), and pierced by 16 windows. The shape and general features of the Chrysotriklinos were later consciously imitated by Charlemagne {{in the construction of the}} Palatine Chapel of the Palace of Aachen, although San Vitale, being located within his realm, provided the immediate architectural model.|$|E
25|$|In hamsters, the CK1ε-tau {{mutation}} {{was first}} discovered by Michael Menaker and colleagues while studying a laboratory shipment of Syrian hamsters. The prominent phenotype in the mutant hamsters was an unusually short free-running period — 22 hours in heterozygotes, and 20 hours in homozygotes for the mutation—making this allele semidominant. The gene was later mapped and identified by Joseph Takahashi and colleagues, which revealed a single base-pair C-to-T substitutional mutation in the hamster CK1ε gene. This {{single nucleotide polymorphism}} (SNP) results in an arginine-to-cysteine substitution in a phosphate recognition domain region of CK1ε, a highly conserved region of the gene across mammals. Presently, {{it is unclear how}} exactly the CK1ε-tau mutation results in a shorter free-running period. The CK1ε-tau mutation in hamsters was the first <b>full</b> <b>description</b> of a mammalian circadian mutant.|$|E
