2500|$|New CBO income {{statistics}} {{are beginning to}} show the growing importance of these items. In 1980, in-kind benefits and employer and government spending on health insurance accounted for just 6% of the after-tax incomes of households in the middle one-fifth of the distribution. By 2010 these in-kind income sources represented 17% of middle class households' after-tax income. The <b>income</b> <b>items</b> missed by the Census Bureau are increasing faster than the <b>income</b> <b>items</b> included in its money income measure. What many observers miss, however, is {{the success of the}} nation's tax and transfer systems in protecting low- and middle-income Americans against the full effects of a depressed economy. As a result of these programs, the spendable incomes of poor and middle-class families have been better insulated against recession-driven losses than the incomes of Americans in the top 1%. As the CBO statistics demonstrate, incomes in the middle and {{at the bottom of the}} distribution have fared better since 2000 than incomes at the very top." ...|$|E

His desk cleaned, he scrawled a quick summary of income and expense, with all earnings from the Harvest mines deducted. He transposed the summary into a second summary, increasing the expense margins, and cutting down the <b>income</b> <b>items</b> to an absurdest least possible. Still the result was satisfactory.|$|E

50|$|While {{he was not}} {{the first}} {{economist}} to work in this field, {{he was the first to}} do so with double entry accounting. Double entry accounting basically states that every <b>income</b> <b>item</b> on one side of the balance sheet must be met by an expenditure item on the opposite side of the accounting sheet therefore creating a system of balance. This double entry system is the basis of nearly all modern accounting today. This allowed for a reliable way of tracking trade and wealth transfer on a global scale.|$|R
50|$|Deferred revenue (or {{deferred}} income) is a liability, such as {{cash received}} from a counterpart for {{goods or services}} {{that are to be}} delivered in a later accounting period. When such <b>income</b> <b>item</b> is earned, the related revenue item is recognized, and the deferred revenue is reduced. It shares characteristics with accrued expense with the difference that a liability to be covered later is an obligation to pay for goods or services received from a counterpart, while cash for them is to be paid out in a later period when its amount is deducted from accrued expenses.|$|R

50|$|Deferred {{expenses}} (or {{prepaid expenses}} or prepayment) is an asset, such as cash paid out TO a counterpart for {{goods or services}} to be received in a latter accounting period when fulfilling the promise to pay is actually acknowledged, the related expense item is recognized, and the same amount is deducted from prepayments. It shares characteristics with accrued revenue (or accrued assets) with the difference that an asset to be covered latter are proceeds from a delivery of goods or services, at which such <b>income</b> <b>item</b> is earned and the related revenue item is recognized, while cash for them is to be received in a later period, when its amount is deducted from accrued revenues.|$|R

5000|$|The accrual method records <b>income</b> <b>items</b> {{when they}} are earned and records {{deductions}} when expenses are incurred.

50|$|The Doctrine of Cash Equivalence {{states that}} the U.S. Federal income tax law treats certain {{non-cash}} payment transactions like cash payment transactions for federal income tax purposes. The doctrine is used most often for deciding when cash method (as opposed to accrual method) taxpayers are to include certain non-cash <b>income</b> <b>items.</b> Another doctrine often used when trying to determine {{the timing of the}} inclusion of income is the constructive receipt doctrine.|$|E

50|$|Accrued {{expenses}} is {{a liability}} with an uncertain timing or amount, {{but where the}} uncertainty is not significant enough to qualify it as a provision. An example is an obligation to pay for goods or services received from a counterpart, while cash for them is to be paid out in a later accounting period when its amount is deducted from accrued expenses. It shares characteristics with deferred income (or deferred revenue) with the difference that a liability to be covered latter is cash received from a counterpart, while goods or services are to be delivered in a latter period, when such <b>income</b> <b>item</b> is earned, the related revenue item is recognized, and the same amount is deducted from deferred revenues.|$|R

50|$|The cash {{method of}} accounting, {{also known as}} cash-basis accounting, cash {{receipts}} and disbursements method of accounting or cash accounting (the EU VAT directive vocabulary Article 226) records revenue when cash is received, and expenses when they are paid in cash. As a basis of accounting, this {{is in contrast to}} the alternative accrual method which records <b>income</b> <b>items</b> when they are earned and records deductions when expenses are incurred regardless of the flow of cash.|$|E
50|$|The willful {{failures}} to report tips, income from side-jobs, other cash receipts, and barter <b>income</b> <b>items</b> {{are examples of}} illegal cheating. Similarly, those persons who are self-employed (or who run small businesses) evade the assessment or payment of taxes if they intentionally fail to report income. One study suggested {{that the fact that}} sharing economy firms like Airbnb, Lyft, and Etsy do not file 1099-K forms when participants earn less than $20,000 and have fewer than 200 transactions, results in significant unreported income.|$|E

50|$|The {{doctrine}} of constructive receipt {{is often used}} {{in combination with the}} {{doctrine of}} cash equivalence {{in order to determine the}} timing of receipt of <b>income</b> <b>items.</b> A constructive receipt issue arises when the taxpayer has not actually received the income, and the issue is whether the income is substantially available to the taxpayer such that receipt will occur for tax timing purposes. A cash equivalence issue occurs when a taxpayer receives a payment as some sort of promise to pay, and the issue is whether the promise is sufficiently definite as to be considered equivalent to receipt of cash income.|$|E

5000|$|Cash method taxpayers include <b>income</b> <b>items</b> (cash {{and cash}} equivalents) {{in the year}} the items are received. See also Treasury Regulations [...] Certain payment {{transactions}} involve cash equivalents, such as receipts of checks and credit card payments. The cash equivalence doctrine arose out of a need to determine whether certain items that were either actually or constructively received must be accrued as income. A dispute over timing of income recognition for tax purposes may arise when the thing received is really {{not much more than}} a promise of payment, such as a promissory note or a bond. If mere promises to pay were considered cash equivalents, then there would be little difference between the cash and accrual methods for tax purposes.|$|E

50|$|A Deferred expense or prepayment, prepaid expense, plural often prepaids, is {{an asset}} {{representing}} cash paid {{out to a}} counterpart for goods or services to be received in a later accounting period. For example, if a service contract is paid quarterly in advance, {{at the end of}} the first month of the period two months remain as a deferred expense. In the deferred expense the early payment is accompanied by a related recognized expense in the subsequent accounting period, and the same amount is deducted from the prepayment. The deferred expense shares characteristics with accrued revenue (or accrued assets) with the difference that an asset to be covered later are proceeds from a delivery of goods or services, at which such <b>income</b> <b>item</b> is earned and the related revenue item is recognized, while cash for them is to be received in a later period, when its amount is deducted from accrued revenues.|$|R

40|$|This study {{provides}} some market based {{evidence on the}} usefulness of comprehensive income disclosures in a Statement of Changes in Equity (SCE). Using a sample of listed New Zealand firms, we find no evidence that separate disclosure of the comprehensive <b>income</b> <b>items</b> provides any value relevant information {{above and beyond the}} aggregate comprehensive income figure. Likewise, in the post-SCE period, we find no evidence of an increase in the incremental value relevance of the comprehensive <b>income</b> <b>items</b> over net income.
