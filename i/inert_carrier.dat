40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} {{is to improve the}} dissolution of poorly water soluble drug valsartan by preparing solid dispersions and also to evaluate the effect of different <b>inert</b> <b>carriers</b> on flow properties of solid dispersion. Valsartan is a poorly soluble drug useful in the treatment of hypertension. Absorption window of valsartan is stomach and upper part of small intestine. One possible way to improve dissolution rate is solid dispersions of the drug. The solid dispersions were prepared by solvent evaporation method using HPMC E 5 LV as water soluble carrier, as use of HPMC low viscosity polymers for solid dispersion preparations were reported in literature. But film formation took place during solid dispersion formulation and was creating difficulty in releasing the drug from formulation; and those solid dispersions, were not free flowing. Thus such preparations are not useful from the formulation development point of view. So to improve the flow properties some inert material were tried like microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and lactose. The solid dispersions were evaluated for drug content, solubility and dissolution studies. In vitro drug release of solid dispersions was studied by USP type II paddle dissolution apparatus. For the solid dispersion the solubility and dissolution of the drug increased with the increase in the carrier concentration. Probable mechanisms of improved solubility and dissolution were characterized by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Powder X-ray Diffractometry (Powder XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) of drug, physical mixture and solid dispersions.

There exist strong evidence that <b>inert</b> <b>carriers</b> play an important positive role in granulation. Most researchers conclude that Methanosaeta concilii is a key organism in granulation.

Many authors focus on the initial stage of granulation, and only a few contributions discuss the latter stages in granulation: granule maturation and multiplication. Granule enhancing factors in the latter stages predominantly rely on manipulation of the selection pressure, through which selectively heavier sludge particles are retained in the UASB reactor.

Many existing active pharaceutical ingredi-ents (APIs) and new chemical entities (NCEs) are poorly water soluble and subsequently have low oral bioavailability if formulated in their unmodified forms. Traditional approaches to overcoming this include: • Improvement of water miscibility by employ-ing self-emulsification, 1 lipid-based tech-niques, 2 solubilisation into micellar cores, 3 or alternatively complexation with cyclodextrins. 4 • Reduction of particle size to nano-scale via mechanical milling or high-shear processing accompanied by particle stabilisation. 5 • Impacting crystal lattice energy using poly-morphs or co-crystals, 6 {{or through the}} crea-tion of solid dispersions of drug in <b>inert</b> <b>carriers</b> or matrices. 7 Increasingly, solid dispersions are being looked at as a viable solution to this pervasive issue. Although only a few solid dispersions are currently marketed, the approach has some inherent advantages over other approaches.
