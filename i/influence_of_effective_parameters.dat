40|$|Aim: This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} {{effectiveness of the}} coagulation process for reactive blue 19 dye (RB 19) removal from textile industry wastewater. Materials and Methods: In this research, coagulation process using three coagulants poly aluminum chloride (PACl), alum, and ferric chloride {{in the presence of}} anionic polyelectrolyte and kaolin as coagulants aid were studied for the removal of RB 19 dye from synthetic wastewater. The <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>effective</b> <b>parameters</b> such as pH, coagulant dose, initial dye concentration, and addition of coagulants aid was investigated. Results: The results showed that the best dye removal efficiency using three coagulants was archived in neutral pH. Under this condition, the optimum dose of PACl, alum, and ferric chloride was 200, 300, and 400 mg/L and corresponding to dye removal efficiency of 91 %, 92 %, and 81 %, respectively. Addition of polyelectrolyte as a coagulant aid with ferric chloride slightly increased process efficiency, whereas adding polyelectrolyte with alum and PACl slightly decreased dye removal efficiency. By addition of kaolin as a coagulant aid with PACl increased dye removal efficiency about 5 %, whereas adding kaolin with alum slightly decreased removal efficiency and can be ignored also, in the case of ferric chloride no significant effect on process efficiency observed in the presence of kaolin. Conclusion: Regarding to obtained results, coagulation can be a robust treatment method for the management of wastewater containing reactive dye...|$|E

The <b>influences</b> <b>of</b> <b>effective</b> <b>parameters</b> including contact time, pH and temperature, amount of adsorbents and concentration of initial dye on {{the efficiency of}} removal of congo red from aqueous solution were investigated. Adsorption experiments indicate that the extent of adsorption {{is strongly dependent on}} pH of solution. Thermodynamic parameters like Free energy of adsorption, enthalpy and entropy changes were calculated to know the nature of adsorption. The calculated values of free energy of adsorption (negative value) indicate that the adsorption process is spontaneous. The estimated values of enthalpy and entropy both show the positive sign, which indicate that the adsorption process is endothermic and the dye molecules are organized on the adsorbent surface in more randomly fashion than in solution. Fitting experimental data to different kinetic models including first order, pseudo second order and Elovich and intra-particle diffusion models shows that the rate of dye adsorption follows pseudo second order model and involvement of intera- particle diffusion mechanism...|$|R
40|$|A novel, simple, {{and more}} {{sensitive}} spectrophotometric procedure {{has been developed}} for the determination of vitamin B 2 (riboflavin) by an aqueous two-phase extraction (ATPE). An ATPE is formed mostly by water and does not require an organic solvent. Other ATPE components {{used in this study}} were the polymer, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and some salts such as Na 2 SO 4 and Na 2 CO 3. The method is based on the interaction between vitamin B 2 (riboflavin) and sodium sulfate (Na 2 SO 4) in an acidic medium (pH 6. 4). The <b>influences</b> <b>of</b> <b>effective</b> <b>parameters</b> such as salt (type and concentration), polyethylene glycol (molecular weight and concentration), temperature, centrifuging time, and pH of the sample solution were studied and optimized. The linear range was 1. 3 – 320 ng/mL (R 2 = 0. 9991; n= 10) with the relative standard deviation (RSD) for 60 [*]ng/mL 3. 68 %. The limit of detection (LOD) calculated from three times of standard deviation of blank were 0. 2 [*]ng/mL and recoveries from analysis of real samples between 94. 82 % and 103. 98 % were obtained for the determination of vitamin B 2 (riboflavin) in urine and pharmaceutical samples...|$|R

A multi fluid model based on the momentum transfer between liquid and gas bubbles was employed to simulate two-phase flow in a vertical pipe. The accuracy of the model was investigated through comparison of numerical predictions with experimental data. The model then was used to study the dynamic behaviour of the two-phase flow around injection point in details. The predictions by the model were compared with other empirical correlations, as well. To obtain an optimum condition <b>of</b> gas-lift, the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> the <b>effective</b> <b>parameters</b> including the quantity of injected gas, tubing diameter and bubble size distribution were investigated.

40|$|AbstractThe {{possibility}} of ammonium ion removal from aqueous solution using light {{expanded clay aggregate}} (LECA) was investigated in this work. FESEM and XRF analyses are {{used to determine the}} sorbent characterization. The <b>influences</b> <b>of</b> some <b>effective</b> <b>parameters</b> on ammonium ion adsorption process such as initial pH (3 – 9), initial ammonium ion concentration (10 – 100 mg/L), temperature (15 – 45 °C), and the contact time (0 – 180 min) were studied. Also, the equilibrium behavior of LECA in ammonium ion removal was investigated in the temperature range of 15 – 45 °C. The results showed that the equilibrium data were fitted well with two Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models in all the studied temperature range. The maximum monolayer adsorption capacity estimated by Langmuir isotherm was obtained from 0. 229 to 0. 254 (mg/g). The required contact time to achieve the equilibrium condition was 150 min. Also, the regression coefficients of the kinetic models and more conformity of the experimental adsorption capacity (qexp) to the calculated adsorption capacity (qcal) were confirmed that the experimental data follow the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The controlling rate of NH 4 + adsorption process by the Webber–Morris model was proved both by film diffusion and intra-particle diffusion models...|$|R
