5000|$|The album {{contains}} some of Harper's best-known songs. [...] "I Hate the White Man", in particular, is {{noted for its}} uncompromising lyrics, and Allmusic described the song as [...] certainly {{one of his most}} notable (and notorious) compositions, a spew of lilting verbiage that's hard to peg. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> irony, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> ironic self-hatred, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> muddled reflections on the chaos that is the modern world, or <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a combination of all of them.|$|R

30|$|The intraductal growth <b>could</b> <b>be</b> very {{insidious}} at imaging because <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> {{small in}} dimension and <b>could</b> <b>be</b> masked by pancreatitis signs.

Whereas {{in the case of}} a lesion that is exclusively intraductal, this is very difficult to observe at imaging; in the majority of these cases, diagnosis is possible only after surgery. At US, lesions may appear hyperechoic and difficult to separate from adjacent pancreatic parenchyma. At CT, often, these lesions are not visible. MR <b>could</b> <b>be</b> useful due to cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) because <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> possible to see a filling defect because lesions could appear hypointense compared to surrounding fluid and <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> possible to see them enhance following the administration of contrast agent.|$|R
