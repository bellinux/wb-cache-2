She reached Trinidad, British West Indies, on 9 November, {{and during the}} next five months operated in the 4th <b>Fleet</b> <b>escorting</b> <b>ships</b> between Trinidad and Recife, Brazil. As escort for , she departed Bahia, Brazil, on 23 May 1944 and patrolled the mid-Atlantic, south of the Equator, in search of German U-boats, until returning to Bahia on 5 June. She made two more patrols during the next month; and, after escorting Omaha to Gibraltar on 13 July, she returned to Recife the 23rd.|$|R
25|$|On December 21, 1720 {{the system}} of convoys was {{established}} to transport tribute and merchandise to Spain. On that date a <b>fleet</b> of merchant <b>ships</b> <b>escorted</b> by <b>ships</b> of war sailed from Veracruz to the Canary Islands. From the Canaries, another <b>fleet</b> <b>escorted</b> the merchant <b>ships</b> to Seville.|$|R
50|$|In 1795 and 1796, he {{was part}} of the {{artillery}} complement of the Nau Príncipe da Beira, the flagship of a <b>fleet</b> <b>escorting</b> commercial <b>ships</b> to Salvador, in Brazil.Upon returning to Lisbon, he was promoted to Captain in the Light Troops Legion, an experimental unit of the Portuguese Army, eventually becoming the aide-de-camp to General Marquis of Alorna. In this capacity he was promoted to Major (1802) and Lieutenant-Colonel (1805).|$|R
50|$|Although mainly used as <b>fleet</b> <b>escorts,</b> these <b>ships</b> also laid minefields {{and escorted}} convoys, during one such duty, they missed the Battle of Calabria and were never {{involved}} in a major fleet action. They came to a mixed bag of fates. Two were lost before the Italian surrender, one torpedoed and one lost in a storm; one, under repair at the surrender was scuttled to avoid German capture. The fourth, Grecale, joined the Allies, was {{involved in a}}ctions against the Germans and survived into long post-war Italian service.|$|R
50|$|The {{ships were}} built by Germaniawerft (F 1 - F 6), Kiel, Blohm & Voss (F 7, F 8) and Wilhelmshaven {{dockyard}} (F 9, F 10). They entered service between 1936 and 1939. The ships were originally conceived as fast <b>fleet</b> or convoy <b>escort</b> <b>ships</b> that could also perform anti-submarine and minesweeping work. They {{were also used}} as a testbed class for a new high-pressure steam power plant intended for use in future destroyers.|$|R
5|$|Fleet {{exercises}} in 1934 {{were carried out}} in the Bay of Biscay, followed by a fleet regatta in Navarino Bay off Greece. In 1935, the ship returned to Britain for the Jubilee Fleet Review for King George V. In August 1935, Royal Sovereign was transferred to the 2nd Battle Squadron of the Atlantic Fleet, where she served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Charles Ramsey. The ship served as a training vessel until 2 June 1937, when she was again placed in reserve for a major overhaul. This lasted until 18 February 1938, after which she returned to the 2nd Battle Squadron. In 1939, King George VI made a state visit to Canada; Royal Sovereign {{and the rest of the}} <b>fleet</b> <b>escorted</b> his <b>ship</b> halfway across the Atlantic and met it on the return leg of the voyage.|$|R
500|$|In June 1944, {{as part of}} the Second <b>Fleet,</b> the <b>ship</b> <b>escorted</b> Japanese {{aircraft}} carriers during the Battle of the Philippine Sea. [...] In October 1944, she left Brunei as part of Admiral Takeo Kurita's Centre Force during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Musashi was sunk 24 October during the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea, taking 17 bomb and 19 torpedo hits, with the loss of 1,023 of her 2,399-man crew.|$|R
25|$|Convoy Hi-81 {{was under}} the command of Rear Admiral Tsutomu Sato of the Eighth <b>Escort</b> <b>Fleet</b> in the <b>escort</b> <b>ship</b> Etorofu. Shinyo was {{commanded}} by Captain Shizue Ishii and the Akitsu Maru was actually serving as an aircraft ferry in the convoy. The other Japanese vessels known to have taken part in the mission was the seaplane tender Kiyokawa Maru, the destroyer Kashi, the <b>escort</b> <b>ships</b> Tsushima, Daito, Kume, Shonan, CD No. 9 and CD No. 61. There was also the submarine chaser No. 156, five oilers, Arita Maru, Toa Maru, Hishidate Maru, Marii Maru, Otowasan Maru and three landing craft depot ships, Shinshu Maru, Kibitsu Maru and Mayasan Maru. The landing craft depot ships were carrying hundreds of men and supplies of the Imperial Japanese Army 23rd Division from Manchuria and were directed to separate from the main convoy at Mako and reinforce the Japanese army engaged in the Philippines Campaign. The rest of the convoy would then continue on to Singapore.|$|R
50|$|The repairs were {{completed}} by May 1942 and Hawkins left {{to join the}} Eastern <b>Fleet,</b> and again <b>escorted</b> <b>ships</b> around the African coast, with periods in drydock for repairs and refits. One of the <b>ships</b> she <b>escorted</b> was , later torpedoed by a Japanese submarine with heavy loss of life. In June 1944 she returned to British waters, where {{she was involved in}} Operation Neptune, as part of the Western Task Force Gunfire Support Bombardment Force A, for Utah Beach. Before this, she had been involved in Exercise Tiger, a disastrous attempt to rehearse the landings. In August she was again designated as a Training Ship.|$|R
50|$|The F class <b>escort</b> <b>ships</b> were a {{class of}} <b>fleet</b> <b>escorts</b> (Ger: Flottenbegleiter) used by the Kriegsmarine during the Second World War. Ten ships were built in total, of a type roughly {{comparable}} to British frigates or American destroyer escorts. They were the only such type of ship built by the Kriegsmarine. The ten ships were not given names, but were designated F 1 through F 10.|$|R
500|$|After her {{commissioning}} in 1942, Anson {{was sent}} to the Arctic Sea with most of the Home <b>Fleet</b> as an <b>escort</b> <b>ship</b> for multiple Russian convoys.

500|$|After her repairs were completed, Hotspur was {{assigned}} to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean <b>Fleet.</b> The <b>ship</b> <b>escorted</b> the capital <b>ships</b> of the Mediterranean Fleet during the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941. In mid-April she escorted the fast transport [...] and three battleships from Alexandria to Malta before going on to escort the battleships as they bombarded Tripoli on 20 April. After refuelling in Alexandria on 23 April, Hotspur sailed for Greece to begin evacuating British and Australian troops from the beaches. On 8 May, the <b>ship</b> again <b>escorted</b> the capital <b>ships</b> of the Mediterranean Fleet as they covered another convoy from Alexandria to Malta before being detached to escort the light cruiser [...] as she bombarded Benghazi harbour on 7/8 May and sank two Italian merchant ships. During the evacuation of Crete Hotspur had to scuttle the destroyer [...] on 29 May after the latter ship's steering had been disabled by a near miss by a bomb.|$|R
25|$|Yaeyama was refit at Cavite Naval Yards as an anti-submarine convoy <b>escort</b> <b>ship</b> in December 1943, {{with all}} minelaying rails removed and {{replaced}} by 36 depth charges, and was reassigned to the First Southern Expeditionary <b>Fleet.</b> She <b>escorted</b> a convoy of transports from Manila to Singapore in January 1944, and a convoy from Manila to Halmahera Island in May 1944.|$|R

25|$|From 10 March, Harukaze and Destroyer Division 5 were {{assigned}} to the Southwest Area <b>Fleet</b> and <b>escorted</b> troop convoy from Singapore to Penang, Rangoon, French Indochina, Rabaul and New Guinea. On 16 November, Harukaze hit a mine at Surabaya, which completed severed her bow. Repairs at Surabaya took until May 1943, but Harukaze was still deemed not combat-worthy, and returned to Kure Naval Arsenal in Japan on 27 May 1943. After repairs were completed on 25 August, Harukaze departed Kure as escort for a convoy to Palau, and continued to <b>escort</b> <b>shipping</b> around Palau {{to the end of the}} year.|$|R
50|$|One early {{maritime}} {{application of}} this technique was used with an aircraft carrier and its <b>escort</b> <b>ships.</b> Because the aircraft carrier physically dwarfed the other vessels its radar return was much larger making it relatively easy for a radar operator to pick it out as a target. <b>Escort</b> <b>ships</b> were fitted with blip enhance transmitters that received and amplified the radar signal so {{that all of the}} <b>escort</b> <b>ships</b> looked like they were aircraft carrier-sized targets. When all the <b>escort</b> <b>ships</b> activated their blip enhance transmitters, all the ships blips grew on the radar display masking the true aircraft carrier blip, and confusing any attempt to target the aircraft carrier for a missile attack.|$|R

The lights are arranged {{so that they are}} visible from an <b>escort</b> <b>ship</b> that is following the aircraft carrier while attempting to maintain a selected range and angular position relative to the aircraft carrier. The lights are arranged such that the number of lights of each color that are visible from the <b>escort</b> <b>ship</b> depends upon the angular position of the <b>escort</b> <b>ship</b> relative to the aircraft carrier...|$|R
50|$|Somewhat {{later the}} two engineers, Tourasse and Courteaut, {{undertook}} trials on the Rhone between Givors and Lyon using steam power. A steam-driven <b>escort</b> <b>ship</b> transported the 1,000 m hemp rope upstream and anchored {{it to the}} shore. Then the escort returned and took the bitter {{end of the rope}} to the actual tugboat. The latter hauled itself upriver on the rope, passing it to the drum on the <b>escort</b> <b>ship</b> as it went. During this process a second <b>escort</b> <b>ship</b> hurried upstream in order to anchor a second rope and thus save waiting time.|$|R

40|$|At {{the behest}} of Angus L. Macdonald, the Minister of National Defence for Naval Services, John Joseph Connolly {{conducted}} a secret investigation in October 1943 into the state of equipment on Canadian warships. Connolly, who was Macdonald’s executive assistant, traveled to St. John’s, Londonderry and London where he discovered that the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) was far behind its allies in the modernization of its <b>escort</b> <b>fleet.</b> Canadian <b>ships</b> lacked gyroscopic compasses, hedgehog, effective radar and asdic, {{as well as other}} technical gear that was essential in the Battle of the Atlantic. These deficiencies should not have come as a surprise. Inadequate equipment on RCN ships had already become obvious during the intense convoy battles of 1941, and had been confirmed yet again by those of 1942. Insufficient training and manning policies also played their part in Canadian problems at sea. However, it was to be the technical aspects that Macdonald focused upon once Connolly returned from overseas, leading not only to a disruptive feud with the naval staff, but also, in their way, to the eventual replacement of Vice Admiral Percy W. Nelles as the Chief of the Naval Staff (CNS) in January 1944...|$|R
