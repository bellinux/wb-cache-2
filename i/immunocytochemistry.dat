It also can evaluate for the localization of cleavage products using monoclonal antibodies raised against neo-epitopes of cleavage sites produced by protease processing.

25|$|Prenatal {{and other}} {{diagnostic}} techniques such as <b>immunocytochemistry</b> (ICC) evaluation are usually followed by FISH or Polymerase Chain Reaction to detect chromosomal aneuploidies. Maternal blood sampling for fetal cells, often used to identify risk of trisomies 18 or 21, poses less risk as compared to amniocentesis and chorionic villous sampling (CVS). Chorionic villus sampling utilizes placental tissue to give information about fetal chromosome status and has been used since the 1970s. In addition to CVS, amniocentesis {{can be used to}} obtain fetal karyotype by examining fetal cells in amniotic fluid. It was first performed in 1952 and became standard practice in the 1970s. The odds of having a child with polysomy increases as the age of the mother increases, so pregnant women over the age of 35 are tested.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Immunocytochemistry,</b> which {{involves}} raising antibodies against targeted {{chemical or biological}} entities, includes a few other techniques of interest. A targeted neurotransmitter could be specifically tagged by primary and secondary antibodies with radioactive labeling {{in order to identify}} the neurotransmitter by [...] autoradiography. The presence of neurotransmitters (though not necessarily the location) can be observed in enzyme-linked <b>immunocytochemistry</b> or enzyme--linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in which substrate-binding in the enzymatic assays can induce precipitates, fluorophores, or chemiluminescence. In the event that neurotransmitters cannot be histochemically identified, an alternative method is to locate them by their neural uptake mechanisms.|$|E
2500|$|Immunohistochemistry or IHC {{staining}} {{of tissue}} sections (or <b>immunocytochemistry,</b> {{which is the}} staining of cells), {{is perhaps the most}} commonly applied immunostaining technique. While the first cases of IHC staining used fluorescent dyes (see immunofluorescence), other non-fluorescent methods using enzymes such as peroxidase (see immunoperoxidase staining) and alkaline phosphatase are now used. These enzymes are capable of catalysing reactions that give a coloured product that is easily detectable by light microscopy. [...] Alternatively, radioactive elements can be used as labels, and the immunoreaction can be visualized by autoradiography.|$|E

2500|$|Ultrastructure and {{biochemistry}} {{of isolated}} gap junctions already referenced had indicated the connexins preferentially group in gap junction plaques or domains and connexins {{were the best}} characterized constituent. It has been noted that the organisation of proteins into arrays with a gap junction plaque may be significant. It is likely this early work was already reflecting the presence of more than just connexins in gap junctions. Combining the emerging fields of freeze-fracture to see inside membranes and <b>immunocytochemistry</b> to label cell components (Freeze-fracture replica immunolabelling or FRIL and thin section immunolabelling) showed gap junction plaques in vivo contained the connexin protein. Later studies using immunofluorescence microscopy of larger areas of tissue clarified diversity in earlier results. Gap junction plaques were confirmed to have variable composition being home to connexon and non-connexin proteins as well making the modern usage of the terms [...] "gap junction" [...] and [...] "gap junction plaque" [...] non-interchangeable. In other words, the commonly used term [...] "gap junction" [...] always refers to a structure that contains connexins while a gap junction plaque may also contain other structural features that will define it.|$|E
