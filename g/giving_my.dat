5|$|That {{first night}} of my {{imprisonment}} was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; {{it seemed as though}} the dawn of day would never come. I found in my bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark and I spent a few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I may say, that although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, <b>giving</b> <b>my</b> time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me {{from time to time in}} my house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.|$|E

500|$|However, {{the singer}} was still seething {{about how the}} media had treated her unfairly {{over the last two}} years. When she started working with {{producer}} Dave Hall on the album, she wrote an answer song for the media.

[...] "I'm saying in the song that I'm <b>giving</b> <b>my</b> back to them. I'm not sorry", Madonna explained. Described by Billboard as [...] "Madonna taking on her critics more directly than ever with a logical, defiant attack on slut-shaming", the song was also about closing the book on the previous two years of her life. [...] "Human Nature" [...] eventually became the fourth and final single released from Bedtime Stories on June 6, 1995, by Maverick Records.|$|E

500|$|Hergé {{reached a}} {{particularly}} traumatic period {{in his life}} and suffered a mental breakdown. In 1956, he realised that he had fallen out of love with his wife Germaine, whom he had married in 1932, and by 1958, he and Fanny Vlaminck, a colourist at Studios Hergé twenty-eight years his junior, had developed a deep mutual attraction. They began courting; Hergé's new companion lifted his morale and shared many of his interests. Germaine soon began interfering with the courtship, causing Hergé to admit his desire had been to maintain a relationship with both women. When he failed to please either, he began to contemplate divorcing Germaine to marry Fanny. His Catholic upbringing and Boy Scout ethic, however, caused him to feel tremendous guilt. As he later related to interviewer Numa Sadoul: [...] "It meant turning upside down all my values—what a shock! This was a serious moral crisis: I was married, and I loved someone else; life seemed impossible with my wife, {{but on the other hand}} I had this scout-like idea of <b>giving</b> <b>my</b> word for ever. It was a real catastrophe. I was completely torn up." [...] During this period, Hergé had recurrent nightmares where he faced images of what he described as [...] "the beauty and cruelty of white"—visions of white and snow that he could not explain. As he later told Sadoul: [...] "At the time, I was going through a time of real crisis and my dreams were nearly always white dreams. And they were extremely distressing. I took note of them and remember one where I was in a kind of tower made up of a series of ramps. Dead leaves were falling and covering everything. At a particular moment, in an immaculately white alcove, a white skeleton appeared that tried to catch me. And then instantly everything around me became white." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{their work}} is {{visually}} impressive and often controversial {{as a result of}} its scale, the artists have repeatedly denied that their projects contain any deeper meaning than their immediate aesthetic impact. The purpose of their art, they contend, is simply to create works of art for joy and beauty and to create new ways of seeing familiar landscapes. Art critic David Bourdon has described Christo's wrappings as a [...] "revelation through concealment." [...] To his critics Christo replies, [...] "I am an artist, and I have to have courage... Do you know that I don't have any artworks that exist? [...] They all go away when they're finished.

This perceived slight, known as the Telegram Crisis, greatly outraged Hitler and he immediately recalled his ambassador from Copenhagen and expelled the Danish ambassador from Germany. German pressure then resulted in the dismissal of the government led by Vilhelm Buhl and its replacement with a new cabinet led by non-party member and veteran diplomat Erik Scavenius, who the Germans expected would be more cooperative. Today it is a well known fact that Scavenius also had the full confidence of the king, who recognized the increasing Nazi threat to Denmark.

2500|$|The Girl {{with the}} Dragon Tattoo began {{shooting}} in Sweden in September 2010. Mara {{did not consider}} the film to be a remake, but another interpretation of the novel. [...] "I plan on <b>giving</b> <b>my</b> interpretation of the character," [...] she stated to Variety. Mara's long brown hair was cut short and dyed black, in a style reminiscent of 1970s punk and 1980s goth fashions. She also had each of her ears pierced four times, and had her brow and right nipple pierced for the role. Her nose and lip piercings were fake. She kept the nipple piercing {{so that it would}} not need to be re-pierced for a sequel. Mara's eyebrows were bleached, and she wore a temporary dragon tattoo. She began preparing for the role by starting to skateboard and kickbox, and underwent dialect and computer training. She also visited Stockholm, the setting of the novel. The film was released on December 20, 2011. Mara received universal critical acclaim and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama for her performance. On January 24, 2012, she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance.|$|E
