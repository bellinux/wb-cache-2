5|$|A {{secondary}} cutoff {{named the}} Slate Creek or Kinney Cutoff breaks {{from the main}} trail near the Lombard Ferry on the Green River, and meets the Sublette cutoff on Slate Creek Ridge at Emigrant Springs. This route was slightly longer than the Sublette, but <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of only 10 waterless miles rather than the 45 endured on the Sublette trail.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} match {{of the actual}} event Carlito faced Chris Masters. In the beginning, Carlito <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> over Masters, as he {{performed}} a splash and Springboard Back elbow on Masters. Masters, however, gained the advantage and executed a Powerbomb. Carlito performed a Back Cracker. Carlito then pinned Masters while using the ropes for leverage to win the match.|$|E

5|$|Nearly {{a decade}} after the Tagora had ceased production, the view of the car in the {{automotive}} press was that it was merely average though there was little actively wrong with the car. The view was that the Tagora <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of refinement, good manners and, in V6 form, good performance. Rust was identified as the single biggest problem for the surviving cars, usually around the rear suspension mountings. Buckley suggested that the car might attain collectible status by 2003.|$|E
5|$|Placing {{the engines}} within the wings <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of a {{reduction}} in the risk of foreign object damage, which could seriously damage jet engines. The low-mounted engines and good placement of service panels also made aircraft maintenance easier to perform. However, the Comet's buried engine configuration increased its structural weight and complexity. Armour had to be placed around the engine cells to contain debris from any serious engine failures; also, placing the engines inside the wing required a more complicated wing structure.|$|E
5|$|The All Blacks played Glamorgan in Swansea on 21 December. The All Blacks <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of {{the wind}} in the first 30 minutes. Late in the first half Roberts worked a move from a scrum to pass to Smith, who passed to Harold Abbott. Abbott then passed back to Smith who scored in the corner. In the second half Glamorgan {{attacked}} but could not score, and late in the game the All Blacks scored tries to McDonald and Wallace to win 9–0.|$|E

5|$|The Comet's thin metal {{skin was}} {{composed}} of advanced new alloys and was both riveted and chemically bonded, which saved weight and reduced the risk of fatigue cracks spreading from the rivets. The chemical bonding process was accomplished using a new adhesive, Redux, which was liberally used {{in the construction of}} the wings and the fuselage of the Comet; it also <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of simplifying the manufacturing process.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{match was}} between MVP and Kane for the United States Championship. Kane quickly gained control, but MVP <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> after attacking Kane's injured ribs. Kane came back, and {{targeted}} MVP's ribs. Kane dominated until MVP rolled outside {{the ring and}} was counted out. Kane won the match, and MVP retained his title as a title could not change hands on a countout.|$|E
5|$|The lighter Lewis gun {{was adopted}} for land and {{aircraft}} use in October 1915. The Lewis gun <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of being about 80% faster to build than the Vickers, {{and far more}} portable. By the end of World War I, over 50,000 Lewis Guns had been produced; they were nearly ubiquitous on the Western Front, outnumbering the Vickers gun by a ratio of about 3:1.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> 6mm Remington <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of a {{relatively}} low recoil of about 10 ft/lbs depending on load. Some gun writers including Chuck Hawks of Guns and Shooting Online believe that this <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of allowing shooters to be comfortable with the rifle without developing a flinch and can ultimately focus on accurate shot placement.|$|R

She delivered a Clothesline and a Long Kiss Goodnight to Melina to earn the victory for her team.|$|E
5|$|The {{series of}} events that caused Kean to change the {{direction}} of DeChow's attack toward Komam-ni began at 01:00, September 3. The 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry, protruded farther westward at this time than any other unit of the UN forces in Korea. Behind its positions on Sibidang-san the main supply route and rear areas were in North Korean hands, and only in daylight and under escort could vehicles travel the road. On Sibidang-san the battalion had held its original positions after the heavy fighting of September 1, completely surrounded by barbed wire, booby traps, and flares, with all supporting weapons inside its tight perimeters. The battalion <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of calling for protective artillery fire covering all approaches. An hour after midnight a North Korean assault struck the battalion. The fight there continued until dawn September 3, when the 1st Battalion, 35th Infantry, counted 143 North Korean dead in front of its positions, and on that basis estimated that the total North Korean casualties must have been about 500 men. The 35th units also <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of well-constructed strong points throughout the battle which the North Koreans could not penetrate.|$|E
5|$|Two {{industrial}} zones {{were set}} up within the township in 1974 by the Saline County Industrial Development Co., one located in Dorrisville, and the other located near the Harrisburg-Raleigh Airport. The one in Dorrisville <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of rail spur prior to {{the removal of the}} New York Central tracks. A Tax Increment Finance district was built on the property of the old rail yard north of the city where the Harrisburg Professional Park was built.|$|E

5|$|Voorhis <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of incumbency, {{but this}} was {{balanced}} by other factors favoring Nixon. Due to the press of Congressional business, Voorhis was able to devote only two months to the campaign, while Nixon campaigned in the district for ten months. Voorhis's time was further limited when, while en route to California from Washington D.C. in August, {{he was forced to}} have surgery for hemorrhoids in Ogden, Utah. He spent two weeks in an Ogden hotel recuperating from the operation.|$|E
5|$|When {{several of}} the {{fuselage}} alloys were discovered to be vulnerable to weakening via metal fatigue, a detailed routine inspection process was introduced. As well as thorough visual inspections of the outer skin, mandatory structural sampling was routinely conducted by both civil and military Comet operators. The need to inspect areas not easily viewable by the naked eye led {{to the introduction of}} widespread radiography examination in aviation; this also <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of detecting cracks and flaws too small to be seen otherwise.|$|E
5|$|With two {{competing}} archbishops, both claiming the see and the Electorate, the contenders {{and their supporters}} gathered the troops. In numbers, Ernst <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage.</b> The Pope hired 5,000 mercenaries from the Farnese family to support the new Elector. Ernst's brother, the Duke of Bavaria, provided an army and Ernst arranged for his brother Ferdinand's army to take possession of the so-called Oberstift, the southern territory of the Electorate; his troops plundered many of its villages and towns.|$|E

5|$|As {{far as the}} Belgians were concerned, the Dyle Plan had advantages. Instead of {{the limited}} Allied advance to the Scheldt, or meeting the Germans on the Franco-Belgian border, the move to the Dyle river would reduce the Allied front in central Belgium by , freeing more forces {{for use as a}} {{strategic}} reserve. It was felt it would save more Belgian territory, in particular the eastern industrial regions. It also <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of absorbing Dutch and Belgian Army formations (including some 20 Belgian divisions). Gamelin was to justify the Dyle Plan after the defeat using these arguments.|$|E
5|$|At 14:00, Ceylon spotted Hamelin's {{ships in}} pursuit and her crew {{increased}} {{their efforts to}} escape, mistaking Victor, which carried three masts, for a larger ship and therefore considering themselves significantly outnumbered. As night fell, Gordon slowed Ceylon by shortening sail {{in the hope of}} meeting Vénus (which had outdistanced Victor) alone. However, the French flagship also slowed to allow the corvette to catch up and so Gordon increased sail once more, leading Hamelin southwest towards Île Bourbon. At 00:15 on the morning of 18 September, Vénus caught up with Ceylon, which began firing on the larger French frigate as she passed. Hamelin, recognising that his vessel <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> in size and weight of shot, did not wait for Victor but attacked immediately, passing Ceylon and tuning across her bows to open a raking fire.|$|E
5|$|Bridges {{and other}} key points were {{prepared}} for demolition at short notice by preparing chambers filled with explosives. A Depth Charge Crater was a site in a road (usually at a junction) prepared with buried explosives that could be detonated to instantly form a deep crater as an anti-tank obstacle. The Canadian pipe mine (later known as the McNaughton Tube after General Andrew McNaughton) was a horizontally bored pipe packed with explosives– once in place this {{could be used to}} instantly ruin a road or runway. Prepared demolitions <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>advantage</b> of being undetectable from the air—the enemy could not take any precautions against them, or plot a route of attack around them.|$|E
