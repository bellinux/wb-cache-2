25|$|On 9 August 1968, a British Eagle Vickers Viscount 739A (registration: G-ATFN) {{operating}} a scheduled service from London Heathrow to Innsbruck crashed in West Germany on the Munich—Nuremberg highway near Langenbrück {{in a slightly}} nose-down attitude. The aircraft broke up upon impact killing all 48 occupants (four crew, 44 passengers). Accident investigators established an electrical systems failure as the accident's probable cause. This meant that during the subsequent descent vital instruments for indicating the <b>flight</b> <b>attitude</b> showed increasingly incorrect readings resulting in loss of control.|$|E
25|$|According to the report, an {{instrument}} {{in the cockpit}} displayed false information, causing the aircraft to deviate from the prescribed flight path specified by the instrument landing system, flying above its glide path. As the aircraft broke free of the cloud cover and switched from instrument controlled flight to visual control, the captain presumably estimated the altitude incorrectly due to darkness and poor visibility, causing the aircraft to come in too far, which made the final approach too late. The captain decided to abort because the little remaining runway {{would not have been}} sufficient to allow for braking the aircraft. At this point, he maneuvered the Convair into an extreme <b>flight</b> <b>attitude,</b> leading to a stall and the aircraft striking the ground with its left wing first. The aircraft burned completely except for the tail section and the right wing. When the rescue team arrived they could only sort through the wreckage.|$|E
500|$|The F-16 was {{the first}} {{production}} fighter aircraft intentionally designed to be slightly aerodynamically unstable, also known as [...] "relaxed static stability" [...] (RSS), to improve maneuverability. Most aircraft are designed with positive static stability, which induces aircraft to return to straight and level <b>flight</b> <b>attitude</b> if the pilot releases the controls; this reduces maneuverability as the inherent stability has to be overcome. Aircraft with negative stability are designed to deviate from controlled flight and thus be more maneuverable. At supersonic speeds the F-16 gains stability (eventually positive) due to aerodynamic changes.|$|E

5000|$|VRLA {{batteries}} {{are also the}} standard power source in sailplanes, due {{to their ability to}} withstand a variety of <b>flight</b> <b>attitudes</b> and a relatively large ambient temperature range with no adverse effects. However, charging regimes must be adapted with varying temperature.|$|R
5000|$|The {{handling}} {{characteristics of the}} Interceptor {{have been described as}} [...] "alarming." [...] In steep turns the elevator became ineffective, and the aircraft was prone to enter a spiral dive or a spin from such <b>flight</b> <b>attitudes.</b> The Mercury II engine suffered from persistent high oil temperatures. Test pilots gave a negative assessment of the Interceptor, causing it to be withdrawn from the F.20/27 competition.|$|R
500|$|To {{counter the}} {{tendency}} to depart from controlled flight—and avoid the need for constant trim inputs by the pilot, the F-16 has a quadruplex (four-channel) fly-by-wire (FBW) flight control system (FLCS). The flight control computer (FLCC) accepts pilot input from the stick and rudder controls, and manipulates the control surfaces {{in such a way}} as to produce the desired result without inducing control loss. The FLCC conducts thousands of measurements per second on the aircraft's <b>flight</b> <b>attitude</b> to automatically counter deviations from the pilot-set flight path; leading to a common aphorism among pilots: [...] "You don't fly an F-16; it flies you." ...|$|E
500|$|The primary flight {{controls}} of the Tornado are a fly-by-wire hybrid, consisting of an analogue [...] Command and Stability Augmentation System (CSAS) {{connected to a}} digital Autopilot & Flight Director System (AFDS); in addition a level of mechanical reversion capacity was retained to safeguard against potential failure. To enhance pilot awareness, artificial feel was built into the {{flight controls}}, such as the centrally located stick; because of the Tornado's variable wings enabling the aircraft to drastically alter its flight envelope, the artificial responses adjust automatically to wing profile changes and other changes to <b>flight</b> <b>attitude.</b> As a large variety of munitions and stores can be outfitted, the resulting changes to the aircraft's flight dynamics are routinely compensated for by the flight stability system.|$|E
2500|$|Long floats, {{each with}} a {{displacement}} of 5.2 m3 and a single step were mounted on pairs of very wide chord vertical members that joined the lift struts {{at the same point}} as those going upwards to the centre section. [...] Bracing was provided by a single, similar strut on each side from float to lower fuselage, leaning backwards at about 60°. [...] No tail float was necessary as the 440 sat at <b>flight</b> <b>attitude</b> on the water. Though designed for a floatplane role, the 440 could and did fly as a landplane. [...] In that configuration the main undercarriage leg replaced the forward of the two float struts and the axle was linked to the lower fuselage by a V form pair of radius struts. In both configurations, the offensive armament of torpedoes or bombs was carried on the fuselage underside, between the undercarriage legs.|$|E

50|$|Flight control {{surfaces}} enable the pilot to control an aircraft's <b>flight</b> <b>attitude</b> {{and are usually}} part of the wing or mounted on, or integral with, the associated stabilizing surface. Their development was a critical advance {{in the history of}} aircraft, which had until that point been uncontrollable in flight.|$|E
5000|$|The {{control of}} these {{dimensions}} can involve a horizontal stabilizer (i.e. [...] "a tail"), ailerons and other movable aerodynamic devices which control angular stability i.e. <b>flight</b> <b>attitude</b> (which in turn affects altitude, heading). Wings are often angled slightly upwards- they have [...] "positive dihedral angle" [...] which gives inherent roll stabilization.|$|E
40|$|Unsuccessful {{recovery}} from unusual <b>flight</b> <b>attitudes,</b> or airplane upset, {{is considered an}} important factor in civil aviation accidents. It is generally recognized that there is a clear need for enhanced training of recovery procedures from unusual <b>flight</b> <b>attitudes,</b> i. e. situations where an aircraft unintentionally exceeds the parameters of the normal flight envelope. Exercising these conditions in the real world is unsafe, expensive and, if performed in smaller aircraft, not representative of the situation in commercial aircraft. Ground-based simulation of these extreme conditions is an interesting alternative for pilot instruction. However, at present, hexapod-based flight simulators used for pilot training are not certified for this purpose. Desdemona, a novel simulation facility, offers an extended motion envelope with enhanced motion capabilities which may prove adequate to simulate upset recovery events. The six degrees-of-freedom motion system features a gimbaled gondola which allows for unlimited rotation about three axes. In addition, the gondola can move up and down along a 2 m long heave axis, and horizontally along an 8 m long linear track. This track can be rotated on a planetary axis so as to produce a sustained linear acceleration up to 3 G. The cockpit contains a projection system for out-the-window imagery, and can be reconfigured into different cockpit layouts. Desdemona has become operational in January 2008. This paper discusses the preliminary concepts for the simulation of upset recovery conditions based on the unique Desdemona motion features. This paper also introduces the motion envelope of upset conditions in support of pilot training...|$|R

The cavity is sealed {{off from the}} rest of the fuselage and can be opened to the outside for viewing. A retractable porous spoiler is installed ahead of the opening to inhibit cavity resonance. The paper presents the mean pressures, pressure fluctuations, spectra, phase, and coherence of the pressures in the cavity and on the fuselage near the cavity, along with pertinent acceleration and torque information for the aircraft structure and telescope. It is shown that a moderate spoiler extension controls resonance in normal <b>flight</b> <b>attitudes</b> and produces a cavity environment with approximately the same turbulence intensity as an attached turbulent boundary layer...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} in the Langley 20 -foot free-spinning tunnel of a 1 / 40 -scale model of the McDonnell F- 101 A airplane to alleviate the unfavorable spinning characteristics encountered with the airplane. The model results indicate that a suitable strake extended on the inboard side of the nose of the airplane (right side in a right spin) in conjunction with the use of optimum control recovery technique will terminate spin rotation of the airplane. It may be difficult to recover from subsequent high angle-of-attack trimmed <b>flight</b> <b>attitudes</b> even by forward stick movement. The optimum spin-recovery control technique for the McDonnell F- 101 A is simultaneous full rudder reversal to against the spin and aileron movement to full with the spin (stick full right in a right erect spin) and forward movement of the stick immediately after rotation stops...|$|R
50|$|The {{pressure}} carburetor {{solves the}} problem by taking gravity {{out of the system}} as it operates on pressure alone. For this reason, the pressure carburetor will operate reliably in any <b>flight</b> <b>attitude.</b> The fact that a pressure carburetor operates on the principle of fuel under positive pressure makes it a form of fuel injection.|$|E
5000|$|Aircraft upset is a {{dangerous}} condition in aircraft operations in which the <b>flight</b> <b>attitude</b> or airspeed of an aircraft is outside the normal bounds of operation {{for which it is}} designed. This may result in the loss of control (LOC) of the aircraft, and sometimes the total loss of the aircraft itself. [...] Loss of control may be due to excessive altitude for the airplane's weight, turbulent weather, pilot disorientation, or a system failure.|$|E
50|$|Wake {{turbulence}} {{is especially}} hazardous {{in the region}} behind an aircraft in the takeoff or landing phases of flight. During take-off and landing, aircraft operate at high angle of attack. This <b>flight</b> <b>attitude</b> maximizes the formation of strong vortices. In the vicinity of an airport there can be multiple aircraft, all operating at low speed and low altitude, and this provides extra risk of wake turbulence with reduced height from which to recover from any upset.|$|E
