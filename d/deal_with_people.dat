With these portraits he created a monument to many of his friends and acquaintances who otherwise would long be forgotten, portraits, which always reflect his own personality, too. This shows itself impressively in his relationship with the founder of New Helvetia John A. Sutter, whom he got to know well.|$|E

He explained that, as a naturally introverted person, he found it extremely exhausting having to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> every day. With that being said, Ward remained working on the series as a storyboard artist and storyline writer, and every single fifth-season episode (with the exception of [...] "A Glitch is a Glitch") featured story input by Ward.|$|E

500|$|Daniels hired Appel as {{executive}} producer and showrunner on King of the Hill in 1997, leading the show's writing process and overseeing {{all aspects of}} the show. Daniels noted: [...] "It was essential that Rich was a good writer who could <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>people,</b> who could help manage the business in the room. But equally important was {{the fact that he was}} someone I could trust, who had a similar sense of taste and values." [...] He stayed until 2001. For his work on The Simpsons and King of the Hill, Appel won three Primetime Emmy Awards. Appel created the short-lived series A.U.S.A., which aired in 2003, which he based on his own experiences as an assistant U.S. attorney.|$|E
500|$|When she {{was growing}} up, Aaliyah {{attended}} Detroit schools and believed she was well-liked, but got teased for her short stature. She recalled coming into her own prior to age 15 and grew to love her height. Her mother would tell her to be happy that she was small and compliment her. Other children disliked Aaliyah, {{but she did not}} stay focused on them. [...] "You always have to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> who are jealous, but there were so few it didn't even matter. The majority of kids supported me, which was wonderful. When it comes to dealing with negative people, I just let it in one ear and out the other. Those people were invisible to me." [...] Even in her adult life, she considered herself small.

500|$|The third {{song on the}} album, [...] "I Believe It", was {{the subject}} of the band's only music video from Toil. The video shows the band singing the song acoustically in the studio, much like the version that is {{featured}} on the album. Instrumentally, the song is guitar-driven and features the mandolin. The lyrics remind the listener to continue going forward even if it is painful. The song has been seen as symbol of the band's faith. The title track, [...] "Toil", is an acoustic protest song that was compared by one reviewer to the Bruce Springsteen album Wrecking Ball. The lyrics tell the story of an unhappy, overworked, working-class man. The song ends with the lyrics, [...] "I'm a slave to that whistle call. I’m a slave." [...] The tenth song, [...] "6'10"", is an alt-country ballad that was written in response to people making jokes about Bawinkle's height. The man depicted in the track is [...] tall and has to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> questioning him about why he does not play basketball.|$|E

Landy monitored Brian's drug intake and used Sol Samuels to prescribe him medication. His assistant Kevin Leslie stood with Brian at every moment, earning Leslie the nickname [...] "Surf Nazi". Leslie also gave Brian medication at Landy's direction. Initially, Leslie was paid salary by Landy, but was eventually paid directly by Brian. In the mid 1980s, Landy stated, [...] "I influence all of 's thinking. I'm practically a member of the band... partners in life." [...] Even though the Beach Boys had hired Landy, part of Landy's treatment involved cutting Brian's contact from the group, as Landy reasons: [...] "You can't <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>people</b> who only want to use you." [...] Brian later responded to allegations with, [...] "People say that Dr. Landy runs my life, but the truth is, I'm in charge." [...] Landy echoed: [...] "He's got a car phone in his car. If he wants to call somebody, he calls somebody. ... He can go anywhere, on his own, anytime he wants." ...|$|E
