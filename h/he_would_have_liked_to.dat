5|$|At first, {{the game}} was titled Parasite, and {{was meant to be}} {{unrelated}} to the Infinity series, but when development began in May 2003, it was codenamed Project Infinity 3. In September of the same year, they added the subtitle The Age of Infinity. Development was troubled by creative differences between Nakazawa and Uchikoshi; Nakazawa was unhappy with Uchikoshi's idea for the game's ending, and had a different ending in mind, which they were having disagreements over. They also did not have the time to write everything that they had wanted, so they ended up with an ending that Uchikoshi described as only being half-finished. At the time of the game's release, a sequel was planned, which would have included a conclusion to the game's story. In 2013, Uchikoshi looked back on the game, saying that while <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> rewrite some portions of the scenario that he felt were boring or that did not advance the story much, he would not have changed or added anything in terms of the content of the game; he felt that his ending was still in the story, and still felt happy with it.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} {{was inspired}} by the multi-character system of Before Crisis, while the naming of magic styles after weapons of war made reference to first-person shooters. The combat was designed to be filled with tension and portray each playable character's personality on the battlefield. The Eidolons were originally not controlled in realtime, but during the development of Ifrit, Tabata did some testing with real-time commands. The results impressed him enough that he decided to overcome the technical difficulties involved and make the Eidolons controllable. Due to technical restrictions and the presence of the Academy Assist function, the game's artificial intelligence for playable characters needed to be limited to healing, survival and other minor actions. The game's multiplayer was deliberately designed around restricted segments. Its development was still ongoing during the summer of 2011, with a temporary stoppage of PlayStation Network that year negatively affecting its development. Because {{of the size of the}} project, debugging the game took far longer than anticipated. Between the release of the demo and the full game, adjustments were made to gameplay mechanics and the in-game camera. In a post-release interview, Tabata commented that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> expand the multiplayer functions to include an ad-hoc function and expanded cooperative gameplay, and create a more forgiving learning curve for players.|$|E
5|$|The designers' {{goal was}} to create a visual bridge between comic and video game graphics. Gibbons drew the {{backgrounds}} in pencil, starting with roughs, which were sent to Revolution to see if they were technically feasible. Once agreed upon, Gibbons would then make the final sketch. The pencil sketches were then colored, mainly by Les Pace. The backgrounds were scanned on a Macintosh as 24-bit, 1000x1000 pixel images with 16 million colors, and then transformed to 8-bit, 320x200 pixel images with 256 colors for the PC version. The backgrounds were designed so that the sprites would appear clear on the screen and wouldn't mix with the backgrounds. Gibbons created the sprites using Deluxe Paint on an Amiga. Steve Ince, who joined the team in February 1993, created a number of sprite animations, also painting some backgrounds based on Gibbons's sketches. Gibbons also designed the characters, although he found it challenging to get a character's personality and expression in a face that was only around seven pixels wide and nine pixels high with a limited palette. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> design a character in a similar manner to Prince of Persia or Flashback, but Revolution wanted something more detailed, so the result became a compromise. All character sprites are smoothly animated with around 20 positions each. According to Gibbons, about 75% of the backgrounds and characters he designed were used in the game.|$|E

5|$|Walsh {{identified}} drinks as {{the central}} Diageo business, and began selling off assets that did not fit this model. He sold Pillsbury to General Mills in 2001 for $10.1 billion, and Burger King to the private equity firm Texas Pacific Group in 2002 for $1.5 billion. He suggested that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> have sold Burger King earlier, but was worried about Diageo's capacity to handle both transactions simultaneously. In a strategy to bolster Diageo's drinks sales, in 2001 he acquired the Seagram drinks business from Vivendi Universal in conjunction with Pernod Ricard for $8.2 billion, an action that was later credited with refocusing and re-energising Diageo. At the time, analysts suggested that Walsh had overpaid, and that Pernod Ricard had gained control of the better brands. Despite having entered into an alliance with Pernod {{in order to avoid}} regulatory issues, Diageo was still forced to divest the Malibu Rum brand after acquiring Captain Morgan. Walsh defended the deal on the basis of efficiency savings {{and the fact that the}} deal was almost entirely financed by the sale of Pillsbury. Of the acquisition he says:We moved in on that Seagram deal and forced their hand very quickly while our competitors were still trying to get their act together. If you look at what we paid it will go down in history as the bargain of the century. It was an $8.1bn total price of which our part was about $5.6bn and it was at economic profit break even at the end of year two. It’s produced phenomenal returns. If you look at Pernod’s Allied Domecq acquisition, it is 30 per cent higher in multiple terms and you’re not getting as good a collection of brands.|$|E
25|$|A {{couple of}} years later, Irvine stated that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> try the {{experiment}} again by concentrating on the Irish and East European sound without bringing in the blues influence.|$|E
25|$|Schuldiner {{performed}} {{well in school}} before becoming bored with education, and eventually dropped out. He later regretted this decision.

25|$|After making several {{appearances}} with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in 2002 and 2003, Bagwell {{returned to}} TNA on the April 27, 2006 episode of Impact! {{as the first}} of Sting's possible tag team partners for Sacrifice on May 14. Bagwell also appeared on the September 28 episode of Impact! in several segments, including a press conference, a video package, and a live segment where he briefly brawled with Jeff Jarrett. At a 2008 live event in Florida, Bagwell expressed that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> work a deal with TNA because {{it reminded him of}} his days in WCW.|$|E
25|$|On 11 January 2011, it was {{confirmed}} that Christopher Lee would reprise {{his role as}} Saruman the White. Lee had originally said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> have shown how Saruman is first corrupted by Sauron, but would not be comfortable flying to New Zealand at his age. Lee {{went on to say that}} if a film were made, he would love to voice Smaug, as it would mean he could record his part in England and not have to travel. On 10 January 2011, it was reported that Lee had entered into negotiations to reprise the role of Saruman.|$|E
25|$|In a {{remarkable}} mistake, Muller left Laroche's division at Mannheim {{on the east}} bank. Laroche understood very well that his division was badly exposed. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> defend the position of Neckerau but it had no bridge, while Mannheim had a bridge. He finally turned to Ney for advice, who suggested moving the bridge to Neckerau. On 18 September, Charles with 22,000 troops assaulted Laroche who had only 5,200 soldiers. Even so, the French resisted stoutly. Ney brought some of his troops to help, but the Austrians overran Neckerau on Laroche's right and drove for the bridge. In the end, the Austrians almost managed to cross {{to the west bank}} by the bridge, but were finally stopped.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the family}} arrived in Queensland, Hugh found {{work as a}} [...] "bush photographer". His {{photography}} assignments were not as frequent as <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked,</b> so <b>he</b> took on extra work for Scarborough local council.|$|R
60|$|Stephen started. Her {{antagonism}} {{was still}} there. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> greatly {{to know whether}} she referred to his hasty purchase of Hester, or to his rashness in dancing with her at her party the winter before.|$|R

25|$|The album's {{front cover}} {{is taken from}} {{photographer}} Peter Sutherland's Sightings series. Sutherland has described his photograph as being a chance encounter with a wild fox that momentarily stopped and stared straight into his lens {{while he was in}} the back garden at a friend's wedding party. Lacey acknowledged that the decision to use Sutherland's fox photograph reflected a running theme of darkness and nature that had subconsciously crept into the album. Additional photographs were provided by Alexa Lambros and Accardi, while Lacey worked with Jason Noto of Morning Breath Inc. on the packaging and layout of the album. Due to an increased popularity in vinyl, the band's label rush released production of the vinyl, leaving the band out of the process - with Lacey later commenting that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> have made the release differ from the CD version.|$|E
25|$|Christopher Eccleston {{discussed}} {{plans for}} the anniversary episode with Moffat, but eventually declined to return as the Ninth Doctor. Sylvester McCoy, who played the Seventh Doctor, claimed {{that none of the}} surviving actors who portrayed the Doctor prior to Eccleston were contacted regarding the special. Colin Baker confirmed this while being interviewed on Australian television alongside McCoy and Paul McGann. However, McGann {{went on to say that}} he could still be in the 50th but at the last moment. Radio Times reported rumours that a Doctor from the classic era (pre-2005) would feature in the special, citing unknown sources. Freema Agyeman and John Barrowman, who played Tenth Doctor companions Martha Jones and Jack Harkness, respectively, both stated they would not be in the 50th, but may return to the show at some point. Barrowman stated that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> be in it, but speculated that the producers wanted to try some different things.|$|E
25|$|The No. 36 team {{returned}} for 2005, expanding Said's schedule {{to a minimum}} of 10 races beginning with the Daytona 500. Like the 10 team which was co-owned by Valvoline executive James Rocco, sponsor Centrix's owner and racing enthusiast Bob Sutton came on as an equity partner for the 36 car, changing the team name to MB Sutton Motorsports. Said had stated that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> drive the car on a full-time basis if sponsorship was found. Veteran crew chief Frankie Stoddard would lead the 36 team. Said ultimately attempted 12 races, struggling on oval tracks, with a best finish of 27th at Daytona and Texas and three DNQs. He did run well at Talladega in May, qualifying 12th and running in the top 15 before a 25-car pileup ended his day with 35 laps remaining. Boris was, however, strong as always in his road course element. At Sonoma in June, Said was running well {{when he entered the}} pits while they were closed after a caution was thrown with 40 laps to go. Sent back to 32nd place, he made it up to 13th place with 10 laps to go, but was relegated to a 17th-place finish after a caution with 7 laps to go. Said shined later in the year at Watkins Glen, starting 41st after qualifying was rained out, and racing with NASCAR Road Course aces Tony Stewart and Robby Gordon for the win. Said would score a career-best 3rd-place finish. Said left the team to drive for No Fear Racing in the No. 60 Ford in 2006.|$|E
6000|$|Following her own train she had {{at first}} no heed for his question. [...] "Without his hatred <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> me." [...] But {{she came back}} with a sigh to the actual. [...] "No matter. We must deal with what we've got." ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{voice was}} stern; it bore to the girl's ears a subtle, unworded {{repetition}} of the threat the Marquise had already voiced. Mademoiselle caught it, and Garnache caught it too, although he failed to interpret it as precisely as <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked.</b>|$|R
60|$|Nutty {{regarded}} his beaming countenance with a lowering hostility. The indecency {{of anyone}} being cheerful {{at such a}} time struck him forcibly. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> mankind to <b>have</b> preserved till further notice a hushed gloom. He glared at the young man.|$|R
500|$|The three lead {{actors were}} complimented for their performances. Ebert said that Gershon and Tilly were {{electric}} together, and Frazer said that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> have seen {{more of their}} love story. Some critics, however, described their onscreen relationship as unbelievable and unsympathetic. Gershon was seen {{to have made a}} comeback after her role in the less well received 1995 film Showgirls. Tilly's performance was compared to her Academy Award-nominated part in Bullets Over Broadway. Pantoliano was described as [...] "a lot of fun" [...] and having the [...] "trickiest scenes in the movie".|$|E
500|$|Del Toro {{acknowledged}} this message's simplicity, {{but said}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> have seen adventure films with similar morals {{when he was}} a child. The film's ten primary characters all have [...] "little arcs" [...] conducive to this idea; del Toro stated: [...] "I think that's a great message to give kids… 'That guy you were beating the shit out of ten minutes ago? That's the guy you have to work with five minutes later.' That's life… We can only be complete when we work together." [...] The director noted that Hellboy and The Devil's Backbone told the same message, though the latter conveyed it in a very different way.|$|E
500|$|Epstein {{attended}} the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in London. His RADA classmates included actors Susannah York, Albert Finney, and Peter O'Toole, but Epstein dropped {{out after the}} third term, {{saying that he had}} become [...] "too much of a businessman to enjoy being a student, and I didn't like being a student at all." [...] He said in 1964 that he [...] "felt like an old man at the age of 21". He also revealed that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> produce a theatre play, or even act, [...] "in something by Chekhov", or a [...] "straight drama" [...] by John Osborne.|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{before he}} died the famous South Asian Islamist Abul Ala Maududi paid Khomeini the {{compliment}} of saying {{he wished he had}} accomplished what Khomeini <b>had,</b> and that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>like</b> to <b>have</b> been able to visit Iran to see the revolution for himself.|$|R
50|$|Unable {{to control}} events the way <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked,</b> President Busch {{committed}} suicide at about 5 AM on August 23, 1939, shooting {{himself in the}} right temple. Though it is suspected by some {{that he may have}} been murdered, the explanation of suicide is generally accepted.|$|R
5000|$|In old age, {{when asked}} if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> Ermione to be {{translated}} and produced on French stages, the composer {{is reported to have}} replied: [...] "It's my little Italian Guillaume Tell; and it will not {{see the light of day}} until after my death." ...|$|R
500|$|IGN's Gord Goble {{criticized the}} {{difficulty}} of the missions but praised the game's soundtrack, which he called a combination of [...] "new age-meets-Alan Parsons Project-meets-Pink Floyd-meets- audioscape." [...] He also highlighted several features <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> see in the game, such as a more complex universe to explore and the ability to control the life forms in the planets controlled by the player. Graham Smith from PC Gamer was also critical of the missions' difficulty, although concluded that it was [...] "a good price for a universe." [...] GamePro Nate Ralph mentioned the life forms as the only negative aspect of the game.|$|E
500|$|Afterwards, Salvo {{presented}} artist Ernie Runyon with a {{rough sketch}} {{of his ideas}} for the game. The crew of Apollo brainstormed titles {{for half an hour}} before deciding on Lost Luggage; Runyon later remembered one of the proposed titles was [...] "Airport Mayhem". Runyon programmed the game with help from Salvo. He has stated <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> include a luggage train, but there was not enough room in the 4-kilobyte cartridge. Salvo had difficulties with collision detection and synchronizing the character movements with the joystick, which took one week to fix. Due to a hardware issue, a graphical bug would also occur whenever a suitcase was captured, which was solved by compiling the game on another computer.|$|E
500|$|Davies {{commented that}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> {{have been in}} charge of the casting. He {{revealed}} that he had initially objected to Hattie Morahan being cast {{in the role of the}} eldest Dashwood sister, Elinor. However, he was glad that his objections were ignored, because he fell in love with her performance. Morahan told The Daily Telegraph's Jasper Rees that she deliberately chose not to watch the 1995 film adaptation of Sense and Sensibility or think about Emma Thompson's portrayal of the character. She explained that she had not [...] "ecause you would go mad. It would distort your work. I thought, it'll be original by virtue of the fact that it's me doing it and there is only one me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Brissenden {{appeared}} to wonder where I was coming out, yet {{not as if}} he feared it. There was even a particular place, if I could but guess it, where <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> me to come. [...] "Oh, she's extremely charming. But of course she's strikingly odd." ...|$|R
60|$|Mordaunt hesitated. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> Dick to tell Jim, {{since this}} might lead {{the latter to}} take the cottage from Shanks. For all that, {{he did not see}} how he could persuade Dick to do so, because he did not want him to think he had an object.|$|R
50|$|Two {{key people}} did not {{participate}} in the reunion: sometime singer Nico, who had died in 1988; and latter-day vocalist/bassist/keyboard player Doug Yule, who Sterling Morrison <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> to participate but who was vetoed out by Reed and Cale. Yule later stated that, although <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>liked</b> being considered at least, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> declined anyway because of family priorities.|$|R
