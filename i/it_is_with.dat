25|$|The {{space of}} {{distributions}} on U is denoted by D′(U) {{and it is}} the continuous dual space of D(U). No matter what dual topology is placed on D′(U), a sequence of distributions converges in this topology if and only if it converges pointwise (although this need not be true of a net), which is why the topology is sometimes defined to be the weak-* topology. But often the topology of bounded convergence, which in this case {{is the same as the}} topology of uniform convergence on compact sets, is placed on D′(U) since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>with</b> this topology that D′(U) becomes a nuclear Montel space and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>with</b> this topology that the kernels theorem of Schwartz holds. No matter which topology is chosen, D(U) will be a non-metrizable, locally convex topological vector space.|$|E
25|$|Islamic philosophy, imbued as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>with</b> Islamic theology, distinguishes {{more clearly}} than Aristotelianism the {{difference}} between essence and existence.

This was first described by Avicenna's works on metaphysics, who was himself influenced by al-Farabi.|$|E

25|$|The {{action on}} the distal tubules is {{independent}} of any inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase or aldosterone; it also abolishes the corticomedullary osmotic gradient and blocks negative, as well as positive, free water clearance.

25|$|Platelets do {{not need}} to belong to the same A-B-O blood group as the {{recipient}} or be cross-matched to ensure immune compatibility between donor and recipient unless they contain a significant amount of red blood cells (RBCs).

The philosophy of Ibn Sīnā, particularly that part relating to metaphysics, owes much to al-Farabi. The search for a definitive Islamic philosophy separate from Occasionalism can be seen in what is left of his work.|$|E
