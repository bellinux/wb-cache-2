30|$|The “loop-snare” technique, {{which was}} {{previously}} described by Rubenstein et al. (Rubenstein et al., 2007) for filters that are tilted against the IVC wall, enables the operator {{to remove the}} tip from the caval wall and consequently retrieve the IVC filter. The concept is as followed: a reverse curve catheter is positioned below the <b>filter</b> <b>tip</b> and used to direct a guidewire backwards in a “U-turn” fashion. The wire is then snared above the filter thereby creating a loop around the <b>filter</b> <b>tip.</b> The sheath is then advanced towards the <b>tip</b> of the <b>filter</b> and traction is applied to {{both ends of the}} wire to pull the <b>filter</b> <b>tip</b> away from the vessel wall into the sheath.|$|R
30|$|During a CT for macrohematuria {{more than}} 8 [*]years later a severe tilt of the filter was seen with two legs around the aorta and one leg eroding the bone of a {{vertebral}} body.

Expecting a difficult retrieval an 18 -F sheath (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Indiana, USA) was inserted into the right jugular vein. Venography confirmed a tilted <b>filter</b> with the <b>tip</b> deeply embedded into the IVC wall and two legs protruding outside the IVC (Fig. 1 b). Two loops were formed around the <b>filter</b> <b>tip</b> using the same instruments previously described: two reversed shape SOS-catheters (Omni 2, 5 F, 80 [*]cm, Angiodynamics, New York, USA) were placed below the filter and two exchange length Bentson wires (260 [*]cm, Cook Medical, Bloomington, Indiana, USA) were navigated {{on both sides of}} the <b>filter</b> <b>tip.</b> Above the tip the wires were snared. A second view confirmed one loop on each side of the <b>filter</b> <b>tip</b> (Fig. 1 c). During traction both loops started to slip away from the tip, therefore a third loop was created (Fig. 1 d) again using a Bentson wire. With 3 loops around the <b>filter</b> <b>tip,</b> the <b>filter</b> could be removed from the wall and finally pulled into the 18 F sheath. Configuration of the 3 loops around different filter struts was documented after retrieval (Fig. 1 e). During final traction the patient expressed stinging pain in the back. Post-interventional venography showed a large contrast pocket was visible at the location of the embedded <b>filter</b> <b>tip</b> (Fig. 1 f) without a true extravasation. An immediate CT did not show extravasation or retroperitoneal hematoma. Because the patient was hemodynamically stable no further treatment was undertaken.|$|R

40|$|Effects of {{mechanical}} compression of the <b>filter</b> <b>tips</b> and of blocking the air channels {{of a special}} filter design on the smoke yields of seven brands of commercial filter cigarettes were investigated. In addition, the influence of these variables on actual uptake of smoke constituents by smokers was studied with four subjects.

40|$|Background: To {{reduce the}} {{possibility}} of cigarette appearance misleading consumers about harm caused by the product, the European Commission’s draft Tobacco Products Directive proposed banning cigarettes < 7. 5 mm in diameter. It appears however, following a plenary vote in the European Parliament, that {{this will not be}} part of the final Tobacco Products Directive. To reduce the appeal of cigarettes, the Australian Government banned the use of branding on cigarettes and stipulated a maximum cigarette length as part of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act. We explored the role, if any, of cigarette appearance on perceptions of appeal and harm among adolescents. Methods: Focus group research with 15 -year-olds (N = 48) was conducted in Glasgow (Scotland) to explore young people’s perceptions of eight cigarettes differing in length, diameter, colour and decorative design. Results: Slim and superslim cigarettes with white <b>filter</b> <b>tips</b> and decorative features were viewed most favourably and rated most attractive across gender and socio-economic groups. The slimmer diameters of these cigarettes communicated weaker tasting and less harmful looking cigarettes. This was closely linked to appeal as thinness implied a more pleasant and palatable smoke for young smokers. A long brown cigarette was viewed as particularly unattractive and communicated a stronger and more harmful product. Conclusion: This exploratory study provides some support that standardising cigarette appearance could reduce the appeal of cigarettes in adolescents and reduce the opportunity for stick design to mislead young smokers in terms of harm...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMucociliary {{clearance}} is {{the primary}} physical mechanism to protect the human airways against harmful effects of inhaled particles. Environmental factors {{play a significant role}} in the impairment of this defense mechanism, whereas cigarette smoke is discussed to be one of the clinically most important causes. Impaired mucociliary clearance in smokers has been connected to changes in ciliated cells such as decreased numbers, altered structure and beat frequency. Clinical studies have shown that cilia length is reduced in healthy smokers and that long-term exposure to cigarette smoke leads to reduced numbers of ciliated cells in mice. We present an in vitro model of primary normal human bronchiolar epithelial (NHBE) cells with in vivo like morphology to study the influence of cigarette mainstream smoke on ciliated cells. We exposed mucociliary differentiated cultures repeatedly to non-toxic concentrations of mainstream cigarette smoke (4 cigarettes, 5 days/week, 8 repetitions in total) at the air–liquid interface. Charcoal <b>filter</b> <b>tipped</b> cigarettes were compared to those being equipped with standard cellulose acetate filters. Histopathological analyses of the exposed cultures showed a reduction of cilia bearing cells, shortening of existing cilia and finally disappearance of all cilia in cigarette smoke exposed cells. In cultures exposed to charcoal filtered cigarette smoke, little changes in cilia length were seen after four exposure repetitions, but those effects were reversed after a two day recovery period. Those differences indicate that volatile organic compounds, being removed by the charcoal <b>filter</b> <b>tip,</b> affect primary bronchiolar epithelial cells concerning their cilia formation and function comparable with the in vivo situation. In conclusion, our in vitro model presents a valuable tool to study air-borne ciliatoxic compounds...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{describe}} the waste produced by and environmental implications of individual cigarette consumption (<b>filter</b> <b>tips,</b> packages, and cartons) and tobacco manufacturing.  STUDY SELECTION—All available articles and reports published since 1970  related to cigarette consumption and production waste were reviewed.  DATA SOURCES—Global cigarette consumption data {{were used to}} estimate cigarette butt and packaging waste quantities. Data from the Center for Marine Conservation's International Coastal Cleanup Project were used to describe some environmental impacts of tobacco-related trash. Data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) Toxics Release Inventory and reported global cigarette consumption totals were used to estimate waste production from cigarette manufacturing.  DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS—In 1995, an estimated 5. 535  trillion cigarettes (27   675 million cartons and 276   753 million packages) were sold by the tobacco industry globally. Some of the wastes from these products were properly deposited, but {{a large amount of}} tobacco consumption waste ends up in the environment. Some is recovered during environmental clean-up days. For the past eight years (1990 - 1997), cigarette butts have been the leading item found during the International Coastal Cleanup Project; they accounted for 19. 1 % of all items collected in 1997.  The tobacco manufacturing process produces liquid, solid, and airborne waste. Among those wastes, some materials, including nicotine, are designated by the EPA as Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) chemicals. These are possible environmental health hazards. In 1995, the global tobacco industry produced an estimated 2262  million kilograms of manufacturing waste and 209  million kilograms of chemical waste. In addition, total nicotine waste produced in the manufacture of reduced nicotine cigarettes was estimated at 300  million kilograms.  CONCLUSIONS—Laws against littering relative to cigarette butts could be better enforced. Additional taxes might be levied on cigarette products that would then be directed to environmental clean-up efforts. The tobacco industry should improve the biodegradability of filters, reduce packaging waste, and educate its customers. Worksites and public buildings should be encouraged or required to supply appropriate disposal mechanisms at all building entrances. Public awareness campaigns about the magnitude and prevention of cigarette consumption waste could be developed through partnerships among environmental groups, health organisations, and environmental protection agencies. Tobacco production waste should be a source of concern and regulation by governments throughout the world; it contains numerous chemicals which may be considered health hazards, {{not the least of which}} is nicotine produced in the manufacture of low-nicotine cigarettes.    Keywords: tobacco waste; litter; environmental impac...|$|E
