50|$|Spiraea {{species are}} used as food plants by the larvae of many Lepidoptera species, {{including}} the Brown-tail, the Small Emperor Moth, the <b>Grey</b> <b>Dagger,</b> the Setaceous Hebrew character, and the moth Hypercompe indecisa.|$|E
50|$|It {{is used as}} a {{food plant}} by the larvae of some species of Lepidoptera, {{including}} dot moth, <b>grey</b> <b>dagger</b> and grey pug, although A. podagraria is not the exclusive host to any of these species.|$|E
50|$|Cotoneaster {{species are}} used as larval food plants by some Lepidoptera species {{including}} <b>grey</b> <b>dagger,</b> mottled umber, short-cloaked moth, winter moth and hawthorn moth. The flowers attract bees and butterflies and the fruits are eaten by birds.|$|E
50|$|The <b>grey</b> <b>dagger</b> (Acronicta psi) is a moth of {{the family}} Noctuidae. It is found from Europe and North Africa to {{northern}} Iran, central Asia, southern and central Siberia and Mongolia. In the Levant it is found in Lebanon and Israel.|$|E
50|$|The larva is black, {{marked with}} red and white stripes, without the bold yellow {{markings}} and prominent horn of the larva of the <b>grey</b> <b>dagger.</b> It feeds {{on a variety of}} plants (see list below). This species overwinters as a pupa, sometimes spending two winters in this form.|$|E
5000|$|Henry Atherton, an English teenager, is {{the protagonist}} of the story. At the end of Faerie Wars, he is {{promoted}} to the title of Knight Commander of the <b>Grey</b> <b>Dagger</b> and given a faerie name of Iron Prominent by Pyrgus. At the end of Faerie Lord, Henry proposes to marry Blue, to which she accepts.|$|E
50|$|Amelanchier {{plants are}} {{preferred}} browse for deer and rabbits, and heavy browsing pressure can suppress natural regeneration. Caterpillars of such Lepidoptera as brimstone moth, brown-tail, <b>grey</b> <b>dagger,</b> mottled umber, rough prominent, the satellite, winter moth, and the red-spotted purple {{and the white}} admiral (both Limenitis arthemis), as well as various other herbivorous insects feed on Amelanchier. Many insects and diseases that attack orchard trees also affect this genus, in particular trunk borers and Gymnosporangium rust. In years when late flowers of Amelanchier overlap those of wild roses and brambles, bees may spread bacterial fireblight.|$|E
5000|$|This {{species has}} grey {{forewings}} marked with bold black [...] "daggers". The hindwings {{of the males}} are white, those of the females dirty grey. The wingspan is 35-43 mm. Adults of this species are extremely similar to the <b>grey</b> <b>dagger</b> (Acronicta psi). Despite the common name, the dark dagger is usually the paler of the two species and the white hindwings of the male are usually diagnostic. However, the only reliable way of distinguishing adults of the two species is by examination of the genitalia. The larvae, however, are very different (see below). This species flies at night in June and July [...] and is attracted to light and sometimes to sugar.|$|E
5000|$|This {{species has}} grey {{forewings}} with bold black dagger-shaped markings. (The Latin specific name also refers to these markings, as resembling the Greek letter psi Ïˆ.) The hindwings are dirty grey, generally paler in the male. The wingspan is 34-45 mm. This moth {{is very similar}} to the dark dagger (Acronicta tridens) and identification is generally only possible by minute examination of the genitalia. However, in general this moth is generally darker in colour than the dark dagger and always lacks the white hindwings often present in the male of that species. The <b>grey</b> <b>dagger</b> flies at night from June to August [...] and is attracted to light and sometimes to sugar.|$|E
