25|$|The {{parliament}} elections {{were held in}} 1920. After the elections, two women got into the parliament – history teacher Emma Asson and journalist Alma Ostra-Oinas. <b>Estonian</b> <b>parliament</b> is called Riigikogu and during the First Republic of Estonia it used to have 100 seats.|$|E
25|$|Otsason was {{a member}} of the Union for the Republic - Res Publica and was a {{candidate}} at the Estonian parliamentary election, 2003. He was elected to the <b>Estonian</b> <b>Parliament</b> (Riigikogu), but turned down his seat and decided to continue his work in the bank.|$|E
50|$|After a 3 October 2007 {{phone call}} from van der Linden, {{threatening}} investigation by French police, Marko Mihkelson, chairman of the <b>Estonian</b> <b>parliament's</b> European Union affairs committee, {{held a press conference}} on 8 October 2007 where he presented materials collected from various publicly available Russian media sources in which central topic is van der Linden's role {{as the head of the}} supervisory council of a certain Dutch investment company that established the biggest industrial park in Europe in Sobinsk, Russia in late 2006. Subsequently van der Linden denied all accusations and stated that he never had any financial interest in Russia neither is he serving as mentioned chairman. He was called the head of the supervisory board of Noble House Group at the home page of the Dutch investment company Noble House Trading. However, a representative of Noble House Holding told Estonia's ETV, on 7 October 2007, that van der Linden is not a member of the company's supervisory board and that the supervisory board would be appointed only next year.|$|R

Võsu ran for the Riigikogu (<b>Estonian</b> national <b>parliament)</b> on 4 March 2007. He was the second candidate on the Estonian Christian Democrats party list.|$|R
25|$|He {{was also}} {{commander}} of the garrison of Tartu. He learned Estonian and showed great tolerance for Estonian nationalism when in autumn 1990 he ignored the orders (as {{commander of the}} garrison of Tartu, for some reason) {{to shut down the}} <b>Estonian</b> television and <b>parliament.</b> In 1990, his air division was withdrawn from Estonia and Dudayev resigned from the Soviet military.|$|R
25|$|On October 10, 1919 <b>Estonian</b> <b>parliament</b> expropriated 1,065 estates (96.6% of all estates). March 1, 1926 law set the {{compensation}} {{to the former}} owners of arable land at about 3% of its market value and no compensation at all for the forests. This almost instantly bankrupted German noble class, {{even if they were}} allowed to keep some 50 ha of their lands.|$|E
25|$|The first freely elected {{parliament}} {{during the}} Soviet era in Estonia had passed Estonian Sovereignty Declaration on November 16, 1988, independence resolutions on May 8, 1990, and renamed the Estonian SSR the Republic of Estonia. On August 20, 1991 the <b>Estonian</b> <b>parliament</b> issued a Declaration of Independence from the Soviet Union. On September 6, 1991, Supreme Soviet of the USSR recognized {{the independence of}} Estonia., immediately followed by the international recognitions of the Republic of Estonia.|$|E

In Italy, he attended commemorations of the 70th anniversary of the Monte Cassino battles, in which Polish, Commonwealth and British troops fought. He also unveiled the British Pavilion at Expo Milano 2015 in Rome at the MAXXI Museum. In June 2014, he visited Brazil and Chile.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Estonian</b> Riigikogu, or <b>Parliament,</b> {{is made up}} of 101 members, elected from 12 {{separate}} geographic areas, or electoral districts. The constituency {{division is}} based on the counties of Estonia, of which some are combined or divided {{depending on the size of}} the population. The capital city Tallinn is divided into three electoral districts based on administrative districts within the city. In the elections to the European Parliament, Estonia has only one national electoral district.|$|R
50|$|Because {{visitors}} of Delfi can anonymously {{comment on}} every news story, this site generates debates over {{freedom of speech}} in the Baltic States. Some members of the <b>Estonian</b> and Lithuanian <b>Parliaments</b> have proposed laws making Delfi and other news portals responsible for the contents of anonymous comments. In September 2006, attorneys of Artūras Zuokas, the mayor for Vilnius, asked public prosecutors to seize Delfi servers and reveal the IP addresses of all anonymous commentators that have written comments about him in several Delfi publications.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{contains}} a brief {{treatment of the}} economic crisis in Estonia, associating it critically with the general economic situation and reasons. The issues of unemployment, increase in prices and several other important areas are under review. Adoption of euro and the price dynamics in Estonia are treated separately. In {{the opinion of the}} author the price increases are not caused by the euro but by the greed for profits and irresponsibility of businesses and traders. National institutions do not view economic policy as an integrated activity either but rather see it as behaviour and choices appropriate for a particular political party. Situation in quite a few areas is critically evaluated, including the activities of the Estonian political parties in power. Organisation of the recent elections of the <b>Estonian</b> Riigikogu (<b>Parliament)</b> is evaluated and suggestions are made both for improvement of the organisation of elections in the spirit of democracy and for the related needs for further development of the Estonian national economy...|$|R
25|$|On 4 April 2005, President Rüütel {{nominated}} Reform {{party leader}} Andrus Ansip as Prime Minister designate {{and asked him}} to form a new government, the eighth in twelve years. Ansip formed a government out of a coalition of his Reform Party with the People's Union and the Centre Party. Approval by the Riigikogu, which by law must decide within 14 days of his nomination, came on 12 April 2005. Ansip was backed by 53 out of 101 members of the <b>Estonian</b> <b>parliament.</b> Forty deputies voted against his candidature. The general consensus in the Estonian media seems to be that the new cabinet, on the level of competence, is not necessarily an improvement over the old one.|$|E
25|$|After the {{restoration}} of Estonian independence in 1991, {{there have been some}} disputes about the Estonian-Russian border in the Narva area, as the new constitution of Estonia (adopted in 1992) recognizes the 1920 Treaty of Tartu border to be currently legal. The Russian Federation, however, considers Estonia to be a successor of the Estonian SSR and recognizes the 1945 border between two former national republics. Officially, Estonia has no territorial claims in the area, which is also reflected in the new Estonian-Russian border treaty, according to which Ivangorod remains part of Russia. Although the treaty was signed in 2005 by the foreign ministers of Estonia and Russia, Russia took its signature back, after <b>Estonian</b> <b>parliament</b> added a reference to Tartu Peace Treaty in the preamble of the law ratifying the border treaty. A new treaty was signed by the foreign ministers in 2014.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 {{parliamentary}} elections have shown {{an improvement in}} the scores of the Reform Party, gaining 12 seats and reaching 31 MPs; the Centre Party held, while the unified right-conservative Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica lost 16. Socialdemocrats gained 4 seats, while the Greens entered the Parliaments with 7 seats, {{at the expense of}} the agrarian People's Union which lost 6. The new configuration of the <b>Estonian</b> <b>Parliament</b> shows a prevalence of centre-left parties. The Centre Party, led by the mayor of Tallinn Edgar Savisaar, has been increasingly excluded from collaboration, since his open collaboration with Putin's United Russia party, real estate scandals in Tallinn, and the Bronze Soldier controversy, considered as a deliberate attempt of splitting the Estonian society by provoking the Russian minority. The lack of a concrete possibility for government alternance in Estonia has been quoted as a concern.|$|E
50|$|The {{architectural}} {{style of the}} building is a rather simple form of neo-classicism. The front façade is adorned by six pilasters and two semi-pilasters made of dolomite from Saaremaa and a dentiled pediment. It faces a semi-circular courtyard surrounded by less ornate outbuildings. The street {{front of the building}} is therefore characterised by the rather unassuming outbuildings. On the building wall facing the street, there is a memorial plaque with the names of <b>Estonian</b> members of <b>parliament</b> and government who lost their lives during the Sovietization of Estonia. The best-known view of the building (illustration) is of its back, which by its location at the edge of Toompea hill enjoys an unobstructed view of the sea. This face is dominated by a large balcony raised on Doric columns. All in all, the exterior of the building still more or less reflects the original edifice. The interior was, as mentioned, badly damaged during the Soviet era, but has been reconstructed, at least in part.|$|R
500|$|The {{largest oil}} shale {{mine in the}} world is the Estonia Mine, {{operated}} by Enefit Kaevandused. In 2005, Estonia mined 14.8million tonnes of oil shale. During the same period, mining permits were issued for almost 24million tonnes, with applications being received for mining an additional 26million tonnes. In 2008, the <b>Estonian</b> <b>Parliament</b> approved the [...] "National Development Plan for the Use of Oil Shale 2008-2015", which limits the annual extraction of oil shale to 20million tonnes.|$|E

2500|$|The Parliament of Estonia (...) or the {{legislative}} branch is elected by people for a four-year term by proportional representation. The Estonian political system operates under a framework {{laid out in the}} 1992 constitutional document. The <b>Estonian</b> <b>parliament</b> has 101 members and influences the governing of the state primarily by determining the income and the expenses of the state (establishing taxes and adopting the budget). At the same time the parliament has the right to present statements, declarations and appeals to the people of Estonia, ratify and denounce international treaties with other states and international organisations and decide on the Government loans.|$|E
2500|$|After 1991 {{there have}} also been {{disputes}} about the Estonian-Russian border in the Narva area, as the new constitution of Estonia (adopted in 1992) recognizes the 1920 Treaty of Tartu border to be currently legal.

Officially, Estonia has no territorial claims in the area, and [...] which was also reflected in the new Estonian-Russian border treaty signed in Moscow in May 18, 2005. Russia didn't ratify it because together with the ratification <b>Estonian</b> <b>parliament</b> approved a communiqué which reminded of Soviet Occupation. In February 18, 2014 a new border treaty was signed by both countries. The treaty must still be ratified by the parliaments of both Russia and Estonia.|$|E
2500|$|According to Soviet sources, {{pressure}} from the working people of Estonia forced its government to accept the 1939 proposal for a mutual assistance treaty by the Soviet Union. On September 28, 1939 the Pact of Mutual Assistance was signed which allowed the USSR to station {{a limited number of}} Soviet Army units in Estonia. Economic difficulties, dissatisfaction with the Estonian government's policies [...] "sabotaging fulfillment of the Pact and the Estonian government", and political orientation towards Nazi Germany lead to a revolutionary situation in June 1940. A note from the Soviet government to the Estonian Government suggested that they stuck strictly to the Pact of Mutual Assistance. To guarantee the fulfillment of the Pact, additional military units entered Estonia, welcomed by the Estonian workers who demanded the resignation of the Estonian government. On June 21 under the leadership of the Estonian Communist Party political demonstrations by workers were held in Tallinn, Tartu, Narva and other cities. On the same day the fascist government was overthrown, and the People's government led by Johannes Vares was formed. On July 14–15, 1940 elections for the <b>Estonian</b> <b>Parliament,</b> the State Assembly (Riigikogu) were held. The [...] "Working People’s Union", created by an initiative of the Estonian Communist Party received with 84.1% turnout 92.8% of the votes. On July 21, 1940 the State Assembly adopted the declaration of the restoration of Soviet power in Estonia and proclaimed the 'Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic'. On July 22 the declaration of Estonia's wish to join the USSR was ratified and the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union was petitioned accordingly. The request was approved by the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on August 6, 1940. On July 23 the State Assembly proclaimed all land to be people's property while banks and heavy industry were nationalized. On August 25 the State Assembly adopted the Constitution of the Estonian SSR, renamed itself the Supreme Soviet of the Estonian SSR and approved the Council of People's Commissars of the Estonian SSR.|$|E
2500|$|The Government of the Soviet Union {{suggested}} that the Government of the Republic of Estonia conclude a mutual assistance treaty between the two countries.
