5|$|In 1981, Fischer {{stayed at}} the home of {{grandmaster}} Peter Biyiasas, where, over a period of four months, he defeated Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games. In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. It was like I was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't <b>even</b> <b>getting</b> out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that.|$|E
5|$|John Verbruggen {{was one of}} the {{original}} rebels and had been offered a share in the actors' company, but became disgruntled when his wife Susanna, a popular comedian, was not. For Rich, it was a stroke of luck to get Susanna and John back into his depleted and unskilled troupe. John's availability to play Loveless remained precarious, however. In September, when The Relapse had still not been staged after six months of trying (probably because Rich was still parleying with Cibber about his availability as Lord Foppington), John was still complaining about his employment situation, <b>even</b> <b>getting</b> into a physical fight over it at the theatre. This misbehaviour caused the Lord Chamberlain to declare his contract void {{and at the same time}} order him to stay with the Patent Company until January 1697, to give Rich time to find a replacement. The original Loveless was thus finally guaranteed for an autumn season run of The Relapse. Since the loyal Verbruggen couple always moved as a unit, Susanna's services were also assured.|$|E

In the match against Somerset, both Ferguson himself and his assistant, Archie Knox, took to the field, with Knox <b>even</b> <b>getting</b> on the scoresheet.

They did remain very close friends until Mineo's death.|$|E
25|$|In January 1916, Stieglitz {{was shown}} a {{portfolio}} of charcoal drawings by a young artist named Georgia O'Keeffe. Stieglitz was so taken by her art that without meeting O'Keeffe or <b>even</b> <b>getting</b> her permission to show her works he made plans to exhibit her work at 291. The first that O'Keeffe heard {{about any of this}} was from another friend who saw her drawings in the gallery in late May of that year.

25|$|From the start, Gullit's {{time with}} Galaxy was troublesome. Not well-versed in the intricacies and {{specifics}} of the MLS such as salary cap and draft rules, the Dutchman never adapted well to the North American league. The ill-fated January 2008 acquisition of left back Celestine Babayaro (who was brought in on Gullit's personal wishes before getting dismissed quickly and unceremoniously without <b>even</b> <b>getting</b> {{a chance to play}} any competitive matches due to extreme lack of commitment in pre-season) {{set the tone for the}} league campaign that was about to start. After getting blown out 0–4 in the season opener, Gullit clashed with midfielder Peter Vagenas, who criticized him for completely neglecting set play practice during training.|$|E
25|$|Without warning, {{there was}} a large {{deafening}} explosion at 3.25 p.m. just aft of the engine room where the whole after section or {{about a third of the}} vessel had disappeared and the vessel settling by the stern. The explosion resulted in timber and debris being shot into the air as well as oil from the fuel tanks spurted up like a geyser. Luckily the oil didn't catch fire. And seconds later the survivors found themselves in the calm sea struggling around grasping bundles of plywood six feet long and three feet wide which were scattered over a fairly wide expanse of sea. The bundles of plywood acted as life rafts as there had been no chance of <b>even</b> <b>getting</b> near the life-boats, let alone launching any of them. There had been no chance of sending out a wireless distress call.|$|E
25|$|Australia A {{dominated}} the first day, mostly thanks to 146 from James Hopes, {{who had come}} in {{as a replacement for}} Phil Jaques. The Pakistani bowling attack who had been so effective a week earlier had been replaced, with only Mansoor Amjad retained from the previous game, and the Pakistan A team had seven new faces. They now conceded 19 no balls in a day, as Australia A racked up 318 runs for the loss of five wickets, and Hopes scored 146. The second day was rained off, but the tourists added 89 in 17 overs on the third day, as Shane Watson got a half-century. Pakistan A, batting second, had Hasan Raza to thank for <b>even</b> <b>getting</b> near a competitive score - the 23-year-old batsman added 111 not out from number five, defying off spinner Dan Cullen to help Pakistan A to 249 for 6 at the close of play on day three.|$|E

500|$|Conker's Bad Fur Day {{follows the}} story of Conker the Squirrel, a red {{squirrel}} who embarks on a quest simply to return home to his girlfriend, Berri, {{after a night of}} binge drinking with his friends. Meanwhile, the Panther King, ruler of the land that Conker is lost in, finds that his throne's side table is missing one of its legs and orders his paraplegic weasel servant, Professor Von Kriplespac, to solve the problem. Kriplespac suggests the use of a red squirrel as the fourth leg for his table, and therefore the Panther King sends his minions to search for one and capture it. As Conker searches for his way home, he finds himself embroiled in a series of increasingly absurd and often dangerous situations, including having to recover a bee hive from some enormous wasps, fighting a Terminator-like robot in a barn, confronting a giant opera-singing pile of feces, being turned into a bat by a vampire, and <b>even</b> <b>getting</b> drafted into a war between grey squirrels and a Nazi-like group of teddy bears known as the [...] "Tediz," [...] which Conker ultimately destroys.

Spinetta's album Artaud (incorrectly credited to the-then disbanded Pescado Rabioso due to his record label contract) it is widely considered the greatest Argentine rock album of all time. By 1970, Vox Dei and their unique mixture of hard nosed rock with subtle melodious undertones refreshed the movement. Their album [...] "La Biblia" [...] (The Bible) {{is one of the}} seminal works of the early 1970s, <b>even</b> <b>getting</b> an unusual stamp of approval by the Catholic Church. In that same year, the first B.A (Buenos Aires) Rock festival would be the first showcase of a rising subgenre that would dominate the first half of 1970s Argentine rock. A new group of musicians was to bring new ideas to the mixing bowl of early Argentine rock.|$|E
2500|$|The idea of who {{people are}} and what makes them who they are is a {{prominent}} theme throughout the series, becoming more prominent as the series goes on.

(Her chapters in A Dance With Dragons see her called 'The Blind Girl' and 'The Ugly Little Girl'.)
