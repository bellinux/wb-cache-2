Copper(II) oxidizes four <b>equivalents</b> of nitroxide to oxoammonium, two <b>equivalents</b> of which (blue) react with alcohols to form carbonyl compounds. The other two <b>equivalents</b> of oxoammonium (red) undergo comproportionation to re-form nitroxy radicals (pink).

40|$|Alternative oxidase (AOX), {{the unique}} {{terminal}} oxidase in plant mitochondria, catalyzes the energy-wasteful cyanide (CN) -resistant respiration. Although {{it has been}} suggested that AOX might prevent chloroplast over-reduction through the efficient dissipation of excess reducing <b>equivalents,</b> direct evidence for this in the physiological context has been lacking. In this study, we examined the mitochondrial respiratory properties, especially AOX, connected to the accumulation of reducing <b>equivalents</b> in the chloroplasts and the activities of enzymes needed to transport the reducing <b>equivalents.</b> We used Arabidopsis thaliana mutants defective in cyclic electron flow around PSI, in which the reducing <b>equivalents</b> accumulate in the chloroplast stroma due to an unbalanced ATP/NADPH production ratio. These mutants showed higher activities of the enzymes needed to transport the reducing <b>equivalents</b> even in low-light growth conditions. The amounts of AOX protein and CN-resistant respiration in the mutants were also higher than those in the wild type. After high-light treatment, AOX, even in the wild type, was preferentially up-regulated concomitant with the accumulation of reducing <b>equivalents</b> in the chloroplasts and an increase in the activities of enzymes needed to transport reducing <b>equivalents.</b> These results indicate that AOX can dissipate the excess reducing <b>equivalents,</b> which are transported from the chloroplasts, and serve in efficient photosynthesis...|$|R
