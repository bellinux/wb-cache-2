25|$|Because of {{perceived}} discrepancies between early and more recent determinations, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) recently revised its standard curves {{as defined in}} ISO 226, {{in response to the}} recommendations of a study coordinated by the Research Institute of <b>Electrical</b> <b>Communication,</b> Tohoku University, Japan. The study produced new curves by combining the results of several studies, by researchers in Japan, Germany, Denmark, UK, and USA. (Japan was the greatest contributor with about 40% of the data.) This has resulted in the recent acceptance of a new set of curves standardized as ISO 226:2003. The report comments on the surprisingly large differences, {{and the fact that the}} original Fletcher–Munson contours are in better agreement with recent results than the Robinson-Dadson, which appear to differ by as much as 10–15dB especially in the low-frequency region, for reasons that are not explained. Fortuitously, the 40-phon Fletcher–Munson curve is particularly close to the modern ISO 226:2003 standard.|$|E
