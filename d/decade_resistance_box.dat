25|$|A <b>resistance</b> <b>decade</b> <b>box</b> or {{resistor}} substitution box is a unit containing resistors of many values, {{with one}} or more mechanical switches which allow any one of various discrete resistances offered by the box to be dialed in. Usually the resistance is accurate to high precision, ranging from laboratory/calibration grade accuracy of 20 parts per million, to field grade at 1%. Inexpensive boxes with lesser accuracy are also available. All types offer a convenient way of selecting and quickly changing a resistance in laboratory, experimental and development work without needing to attach resistors one by one, or even stock each value. The range of resistance provided, the maximum resolution, and the accuracy characterize the box. For example, one <b>box</b> offers <b>resistances</b> from 0 to 100 megohms, maximum resolution 0.1 ohm, accuracy 0.1%.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT During {{the last}} <b>decade</b> <b>resistance</b> against {{environmental}} destruction has spread {{throughout much of}} the developed world. Over this period Environmental Direct Action (EDA) has evolved into an inventive and dynamic movement that not only rallies against specific environmental damages, but also the broader political and economic systems that are perceived to facilitate them. With the growth of Environmental Direct Action there has been a concomitant increase in the number wishing to understand and explain the phenomenon. This expansion of academic interest raises two questions: (1) Are conventional academic epistemologies suitable to understand and explain the motivations of and challenges posed by EDA?, and (2) Do the power relations inherent within such approaches facilitate or preclude our opportunities to make sense of this resistance movement? This paper uses experience gained from my own empirical work on EDA in the UK to explore these issues...|$|R

40|$|A small-scale, composting, {{microbial}} {{fuel cell}} (MFC) system was constructed that used cow manure as the reduced carbon energy source.
