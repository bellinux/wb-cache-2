In practice this seldom occurs due to concerns about the cleanliness of the TXRF system. This paper describes the results of tests on the particulate levels introduced by several TXRF instruments. The top (polished) sides of bare silicon wafers were analyzed by a Tencor particle counting system and then analyzed by TXRJ! either top-side up (to detect particles introduced on the top side by a typical TXRF analysis) or top-side down (to detect particles normally introduced onto the wafer bottoms by the wafer handling system).

When patterns of particles were detected, wafers were analyzed by TXRF in areas of high and low particle density to determine the identity of the particles. The results from three TXRF instruments of various vintages and in different environments indicated that significant numbers of add-on particles were introduced on the front side, with much higher levels introduced on the back side, primarily from the wafer chuck; consequently, until improvements are made such that particulate levels are reduced, TXRF cannot safely be used as a true <b>in-line</b> <b>analysis</b> tool in a modern semiconductor wafer manufacturing area.

40|$|This {{manuscript}} {{presents a}} novel method {{for the analysis}} of vapour permeation through polymeric membranes based on <b>in-line</b> <b>analysis</b> of the permeate with an FID detector. The hexane vapour permeation was studied for two commercially available membranes, namely low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and thin-film-composite polyamide (PA) membrane. The hexane permeation was studied at temperatures of 25 – 45 °C, hexane vapour activity in the range of 0. 2 – 0. 8 and trans-membrane pressures of 5 – 50 kPa. Two fundamentally different membranes were chosen to demonstrate the potential and sensitivity of the permeation apparatus. Upon increasing the temperature from 25 to 45 °C, the flux in LDPE was found to increase almost fourfold over the whole activity range. The nonlinear increase of the flux with activity indicates plasticization of the polymer by hexane. Contrarily, the flux in the PA membrane increases almost linearly with activity, with only a minor upward curvature. Since the PA is far away from any phase transition, it is less temperature-dependent than LDPE. The activation energy for permeation demonstrates that the temperature dependence in the LDPE membrane is dominated by changes in diffusion, whereas it is dominated by changes in solubility in the PA membrane.

30|$|Controversial {{evidence}} has been reported so far {{on the effect of}} stripping on enamel morphology and roughness. SEM studies [19, 20] showed that perforated diamond-coated disks with less than 30 -μm grain size minimized grinding defects, whereas subsequent polishing with fine and extra-fine alumina disks (Sof-Lex, 3 M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA) produced smooth surfaces, equally to or smoother than untreated enamel. Nevertheless, {{the results of this study}} were mainly based on subjective qualitative assessment of enamel morphological characteristics. On the other hand, qualitative assessment by SEM and quantitative assessment of the amplitude parameter Ra by in-line stylus profilometry [21] showed that stripping disks and diamond-coated metal strips followed by fine Sof-Lex disks produced significantly rougher surfaces in comparison with the intact enamel of permanent and deciduous teeth. Qualitative (scanning electron microscopy) and quantitative (surface roughness test) measurements by Gupta et al. [22] also showed that the enamel after stripping with diamond disks and different polishing methods was significantly rougher than untreated control teeth. To improve the reliability of quantitative analysis, 3 D optical profilometry was used to determine the Ra values by scanning sample areas rather than performing <b>in-line</b> <b>analysis</b> on enamel areas [23]. The results showed that grinding and polishing with automatic oscillating systems, including Ortho-Strips, resulted in equally smooth surfaces with untreated enamel, or even better.

40|$|Dairy powders {{derived from}} {{membrane}} filtration processes, such as milk protein concentrate (MPC) and phosphocaseinate (PC) powders, have considerable potential as functional ingredients {{due to their}} high proteincontent and quality. However, {{the use of these}} powders is sometimes limited or impaired by their poor rehydration characteristics in aqueous media, which has been linked with the formation of an inter-linked network of casein micelles at particle surfaces during processing and storage. Analytical tools are now available which can monitor the rehydration of dairy powders dynamically. This is a considerable development, as the rate-limiting stages of rehydration for individual powders (e. g., wetting,dispersion) can now be identified, quantified and targeted in attempts to improve rehydration properties. In addition, these technologies allow the negative effects of sub-optimal processing or storage conditions on powder rehydration and solubility characteristics to be measured, which allows preventative strategies against loss of solubility to be developed.

40|$|In this report, {{we present}} a new {{approach}} for {{the determination of the}} disulfide bond connectivity in proteins using negative ionization mass spectrometry of nonreduced enzymatic digests. The mass spectrometric analysis in negative ion mode was optimized to allow <b>in-line</b> <b>analysis</b> coupled directly to the HPLC system used for the separation of the peptides resulting from enzymatic digestion. We determined the disulfide structure of a human immunoglobulin gamma 2 (IgG 2) antibody containing 18 unique cysteine residues linked via 11 unique disulfide bonds. The efficiency of the gas-phase dissociation of disulfide-linked peptides using negative electrospray ionization was evaluated for an ion trap mass spectrometer and an orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Both mass spectrometry techniques provided efficient in-source fragmentation for the identification of the disulfide-linked peptides of the antibody. Both instruments were limited in the number of disulfide bonds that could be dissociated. Seven of the 11 unique disulfide linkages have been determined, including the linkage of the light chain to the heavy chain. Only the disulfide connectivity of the hinge peptide H 6 H 7 H 8 H 9 (C 6 C 7 VEC 8 PPC 9 PAPPVAGPSVFLFPPKPK) could not be determined (numbering the cysteine residues sequentially from the N-terminus and labeling the heavy chain cysteines “H” and the light chain cysteines “L”).

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) has {{millions}} of gallons of radioactive liquid and sludge wastes stored in underground tanks at several of its sites. In order to comply with various regulations and to circumvent potential problems associated with tank integrity, these wastes must be retrieved from the tanks, transferred to treatment facilities (or other storage locations), and processed to stable waste forms. The sludge wastes will typically be mobilized by some mechanical means (e. g., mixer pump, submerged jet) and mixed with the respective supernatants to create slurries that can be transferred by pipeline to the desired destination. Depending on the DOE site, these slurries may be transferred up to six miles. Since the wastes are radioactive, it is critically important for the transfers to be made without plugging a pipeline. To reduce such a risk, the relevant properties of the slurry (e. g., density, suspended solids concentration, viscosity, and particle size distribution) should be determined to be within acceptable limits prior to transfer. These properties should also be continuously monitored and controlled within specified limits while the transfer is in progress. The baseline method for determining the transport properties of slurries involves sampling and analysis; however, this method is time-consuming, and costly, and it does not provide real-time information. In addition, personnel who collect and analyze the samples are exposed to radiation. It is also questionable as to whether a laboratory analyst can obtain representative aliquots from the sample jar for these solid-liquid mixtures. The alternative method for determining the transport properties is <b>in-line</b> <b>analysis.</b> An in-line instrument is one that is connected to the process, analyzes the slurry as it flows through or by the instrument, and provides the results within seconds.

One of the highest priorities is to determine the concentration of suspended solids in each of the slurries. In the project described in this report, two Coriolis meters were used simultaneously to create a suspended solids monitoring system that would provide accurate results with high precision. One Coriolis meter was used to measure the density of the slurry, while the other meter was used to measure the density of the carrier fluid (i. e., after filtration to remove the solid particles).

In order to comply with various regulations and to circumvent potential problems associated with tank integrity, these wastes must be retrieved from the underground tanks, transferred to treatment facilities (or other storage location), and processed to a stable waste form. Each sludge waste will typically be mobilized by some mechanical means (e. g., mixer pump, submerged jet) and mixed with the supernatant to create a slurry that can be transferred by pipeline to the desired destination. Depending on the DOE site, such slurries may be transferred up to six miles. Since these wastes are radioactive, it is critically important that the transfers be conducted safely and successfully. The transport properties of a given slurry must be within the appropriate design limits to prevent the formation of a pipeline plug. The consequences of a plugged pipeline with radioactive material are unacceptable from the perspectives of safety, cost, and schedule. If a pipeline plug occurs and conventional methods (e. g., water flushing) are not successful, either the entire pipeline must be replaced (and the plugged pipeline remediated at a later date) or the plugged sections must be located, excised, and replaced. Either option would expose workers to radiation fields, and the cost of the project could escalate and result in a severe delay of the project schedule. Even if a pipeline plug were successfully removed by conventional methods, the project would experience some delay and additional costs. For example, flushing a plugged pipeline would require a shutdown of operations until the situation could be resolved; and such action would lead to the generation of additional liquid waste, which would also require treatment. To reduce the risk of plugging a pipeline, the relevant properties of the slurry (e. g., density, suspended solids concentration, viscosity, and particle size distribution) should be determined to be within acceptable limits prior to transfer.

When the stability conditions have been met, the simulation prompts the user to consider stopping the simulation. On the other hand, if {{at the end of}} the run length selected by the user, the statistical conditions were not satisfied, the tool notifies the user of that fact. This capability enabled us to significantly reduce the simulation run lengths, and ensures, with little additional computational effort, that the results were reliable. We used this tool to control simulations of electronics, steel, automotive, and metal processing industries. In general, using this tool we realized a reduction of more than 40 % in the time required for simulation...|$|R
40|$|The {{implications}} of froth stability for recovery in mineral flotation are often underestimated. In the last years, technology and automation {{have been widely}} implemented in flotation plants, so that automatic level control and <b>in-line</b> visual <b>analysis</b> of the froth are now a standard feature in modern concentrators. However, most of the decision making process still relies on the operator's experience. The best flotation strategy is generally determined empirically, and froth stability, in particular, is rarely quantified. In this work, froth stability has been assessed, down the bank, in two different concentrators treating copper sulphide minerals. Froth stability was measured, in situ of the flotation cells, {{by the use of}} a transportable device (modified froth stability column), and other froth descriptors, like froth velocity and froth depth, were also measured. Differences in froth stability have been correlated to the different plant operating conditions, and implications on the recovery of minerals across the froth phase are discussed. It is shown that different flotation strategies may lead to similar metallurgical performance, and that froth stability can be a useful indicator to optimise operating conditions in the flotation cells.
