5|$|Although Enron's {{compensation}} and performance management system {{was designed to}} retain and reward its most valuable employees, the system contributed to a dysfunctional corporate culture that became obsessed with short-term earnings to maximize bonuses. Employees constantly tried to start deals, often <b>disregarding</b> <b>the</b> quality of cash flow or profits, {{in order to get}} a better rating for their performance review. Additionally, accounting results were recorded as soon as possible to keep up with the company's stock price. This practice helped ensure deal-makers and executives received large cash bonuses and stock options.|$|E
5|$|As the {{president}} begins continuity-of-government procedures, Fisher shuts down the burning plant and averts {{a chain reaction}} to the next reserve. When he captures another senior Engineer, he learns about Sadiq's final plan: to disclose all U.S. military secrets. Sadiq kidnaps the Secretary of Defense and holds them at the Site F government bunker under Denver International Airport. <b>Disregarding</b> <b>the</b> president's order, Fourth Echelon infiltrates the base.

Briggs intervenes, killing the secretary and halting Sadiq's plan.|$|E
5|$|Because {{high levels}} of jitter have been {{detected}} in the spectrum of HAT-P-33, the ability to collect the most sensitive radial velocity measurements possible has been dulled. The loss of accuracy has prevented astronomers from <b>disregarding</b> <b>the</b> possibility that HAT-P-33 is actually a binary star, where the secondary, dimmer companion is visually indistinguishable from the brighter primary companion. If this is the case, then the dimmer star in the HAT-P-33 system {{would have to have}} a mass that is less than 0.55 times that of the Sun. A search for a binary companion star using adaptive optics at the MMT Observatory was negative.|$|E

5|$|<b>Disregarding</b> <b>the</b> dates, most historians agree {{upon the}} same {{sequence}} of events for {{this part of the}} Sacred War. The principal question is therefore when that sequence started. Thus, Buckler (as well as Beloch and Cloche) dates Neon to 355 BC, Methone to 355–354 BC, Philip's first Thessalian campaign to 354 BC, and his second to 353 BC. Conversely, Cawkwell, Sealey, Hammond and others give these dates as occurring one year later, beginning with Neon in 354 BC.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1410s several Fellows of Oriel {{took part in}} the {{disturbances}} accompanying Archbishop Arundel's attempt to stamp out Lollardy in the University; the Lollard belief that religious power and authority came through piety and not through the hierarchy of the Church particularly inflamed passions in Oxford, where its proponent, John Wycliffe, had been head of Balliol. <b>Disregarding</b> <b>the</b> Provost's authority, Oriel's Fellows fought bloody battles with other scholars, killed one of the Chancellor's servants when they attacked his house, and were prominent among the group that obstructed the Archbishop and ridiculed his censures.|$|E

5|$|The {{hopes of}} the abolitionists notwithstanding, slavery did not wither {{with the end}} of the slave trade in the British Empire, nor did the living {{conditions}} of the enslaved improve. The trade continued, with few countries following suit by abolishing the trade, and with some British ships <b>disregarding</b> <b>the</b> legislation. Wilberforce worked with the members of the African Institution to ensure the enforcement of abolition and to promote abolitionist negotiations with other countries. In particular, the US had abolished the slave trade in 1808, and Wilberforce lobbied the American government to enforce its own prohibition more strongly.|$|E
5|$|At the {{recommendation}} of the Vicar General of Verapoly, Mons. Joseph Sebastiani, Pope Clement X appointed Bishop Thomas de Castro, a Goan Theatine and Bishop of Fulsivelem, as the Vicar Apostolic of Propaganda Fide in the Vicariate of Canara on 30 August 1675, for the purpose of providing spiritual leadership to the Canara Christians. After his consecration, he first went to Calicut and then moved to Mangalore, where he served from 1677 to 1684. In 1677, Bishop de Castro entered into a conflict with the Archbishop of Goa, Dom Frei António Brandão, for <b>disregarding</b> <b>the</b> Padroado. Consequently, they did not cede the jurisdiction to him despite the Pope's letter of appointment. The Padroado–Propaganda conflict which ensued divided the Catholics of Canara into two sides—those who recognised the authority of the Padroado Archbishop in Goa versus those who supported de Castro.|$|E
5|$|For a few centuries, Europeans had {{experimented with}} American vines and plants in their soil, and many {{varieties}} were imported from America without regulation, <b>disregarding</b> <b>the</b> possibility of pest transfer, and related problems. Jules-Emile Planchon, a French biologist, who identified the Phylloxera in the 1860s, maintained that this transfer of American vines and plants into Europe greatly increased between roughly 1858 and 1862, {{and this is}} how the Phylloxera was accidentally introduced to Europe around 1860, although the aphid did not enter France until around 1863. It is believed that the advent of steamships was a factor as well, as the ships were faster, and the Phylloxera were able to survive the quicker ocean voyage.|$|E

5|$|At 00:25, Kondo {{ordered all}} of his ships that were able to {{converge}} and destroy any remaining U.S.ships. However, the Japanese ships still {{did not know where}} Washington was located, and the other surviving U.S.ships had already departed the battle area. Washington steered a northwesterly course toward the Russell Islands to draw the Japanese force away from Guadalcanal and the presumably damaged South Dakota. The Imperial ships finally sighted Washington and launched several torpedo attacks, but by the skilled seamanship of her captain she avoided all of them and also avoided running aground in shallow waters. At length, believing that the way was clear for the transport convoy to proceed to Guadalcanal (but apparently <b>disregarding</b> <b>the</b> threat of air attack in the morning), Kondo ordered his remaining ships to break contact and retire from the area about 01:04, which most of the Japanese warships complied with by 01:30.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} third century, {{the balance of}} power had shifted from the Senate to the army, and the {{position}} of the Senate was considerably weakened. The emperor of Rome was appointed by the support of the military, while the Senate existed solely to officiate state affairs without any real authority. Both Macrinus and later Elagabalus secured the support of the military while generally <b>disregarding</b> <b>the</b> opinion of the Senate. Macrinus was in dire circumstances after Elagabalus' rebellion and had no other choice but to turn to the Senate for assistance. While in Antioch, Macrinus made one final attempt at securing support, this time from Rome. A combination of distrust from the Senate, insufficient funds, and Elagabalus' impending approach, however, forced Macrinus to face Elagabalus' approaching legions with only his Praetorian Guard. Had more time had been available, the Prefect of Rome Marius Maximus {{might have been able to}} muster troops to send as reinforcements to assist Macrinus. Despite their relative powerlessness, the Senate still declared war against the usurper and his family.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} {{that began with the}} {{accession}} of the Emperor Nerva and ended with the death of the Emperor Commodus, the Empire continued to weaken. It was becoming difficult to recruit enough soldiers for the army, inflation was becoming an issue, and on at least one occasion, the Empire almost went bankrupt. The most significant constitutional development during this era was the steady drift towards monarchy. M. Cocceius Nerva succeeded Domitian, and although his reign was too short for any major constitutional reforms, he did reverse some of his predecessor's abuses. He was succeeded by Trajan in 98, who then went further than even Nerva had in restoring the image of a free republic, by, for example, allowing the senate to regain some independent legislative abilities. Hadrian succeeded Trajan as Emperor. By far, his most important constitutional alteration was his creation of a bureaucratic apparatus, which included a fixed gradation of clearly defined offices, and a corresponding order of promotion. Hadrian was succeed by Antonius Pius, who made no real changes to the constitution. Antonius Pius was succeeded by Marcus Aurelius in 161. The most significant constitutional development that occurred during the reign of Marcus Aurelius was the revival of the republican principle of collegiality, as he made his brother, L. Aelius, his co-emperor. In 169, Aelius died, and in 176, Marcus Aurelius made his son, L. Aurelius Commodus, his new co-emperor. In 180, Marcus Aurelius died, and Commodus became Emperor. Commodus' tyranny revived the worst memories of the later Julian emperors, as he was more explicit than any of his predecessors in taking powers that he did not legally have, and in <b>disregarding</b> <b>the</b> constitution. He was killed in 192.|$|E
