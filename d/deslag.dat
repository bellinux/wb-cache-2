40|$|Background and objectives: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is {{the most}} common and {{distressing}} symptom that affects overall quality of life of cancer patients. Due to the multi-factorial etiology, there is currently no “gold standard” for treatment of CRF. Considering the growing importance of national traditional medicines, natural remedies are viewed as playing distinctive role. “Jollab” is a natural syrup prescribed by Iranian traditional medicine (ITM) scholars as tonic especially for the cardiovascular system. “Jollab” can consist of several ingredients although almost all traditional recipes include saffron and rose water as well as sugar or honey. The aim of this research was to develop a honey based “Jollab” and evaluate hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), a product of fructose decomposition, as an indicator of heating effect on honey. Methods: Several “Jollab” formulations with different proportions of honey and rose water were prepared using <b>deslagging</b> procedure through direct or indirect heating. The HMF content of the formulation was measured according to International Honey Commission (IHC) method. Results: “Jollab” was formulated with saffron (0. 1 %), honey (57. 1 %) and rose water (42. 8 %). Two-thirds of the rose water was evaporated during <b>deslagging</b> procedure through direct heating (up to 95 °C) and the remaining was added to the honey {{at the end of the}} process. Moreover, the HMF content of the prepared Jollab was 64. 47 ± 5. 49 mg/kg which meets ICH standards. Conclusion: The developed honey based Jollab could be considered as a safe formulation for further studies in the field of CRF due to the acceptable HMF content...|$|R

Ways to lower phosphorus content without major loss of chromium in order to decrease the production costs of Sandvik AB’s stainless steel. The study was conducted with respect to oxidizing dephosphorization and parameters affecting dephosphorization are carbon and chromium content, temperature and slag properties. It was revealed that higher carbon content and basicity is beneficial to the dephosphorization process.

A method of refining chromium in slag using an electric arc furnace (EAF) was also discovered. This made it possible to extract 97 % of all chromium in slag.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} to assess the behaviours of Cold Briquetted Iron (CBI) when exposed to increasing temperature changes up to its complete melting. High-temperature behaviours and melting characteristics of CBI were studied. Ground as-received CBI briquette and those heated to temperatures ranging from 500 °C to 1000 °C were sieved to maximum of 30 microns diameter size and their room-temperature x-ray diffraction (XRD) measured. CBI was found to contain among others, α-iron, cementite and silica phases. Cementite was found to commence decomposition at 500 °C - 600 °C and completed by 700 °C with conspicuous increase in the concentration of α-iron phase.

50|$|Starting a {{continuous}} casting machine involves placing a dummy bar (essentially a curved metal beam) up through the spray chamber to close off {{the base of the}} mould. Metal is poured into the mould and withdrawn with the dummy bar once it solidifies. It is extremely important that the metal supply afterwards be guaranteed to avoid unnecessary shutdowns and restarts, known as 'turnarounds'. Each time the caster stops and restarts, a new tundish is required, as any uncast metal in the tundish cannot be drained and instead freezes into a 'skull'. Avoiding turnarounds requires the meltshop, including ladle furnaces (if any) to keep tight control on the temperature of the metal, which can vary dramatically with alloying additions, slag cover and <b>deslagging,</b> and the preheating of the ladle before it accepts metal, among other parameters. However, the cast rate may be lowered by reducing the amount of metal in the tundish (although this can increase wear on the tundish), or if the caster has multiple strands, one or more strands may be shut down to accommodate upstream delays. Turnarounds may be scheduled into a production sequence if the tundish temperature becomes too high after a certain number of heats or the service lifetime of a non-replaceable component (i.e., the submerged entry nozzle (SEN) in a thin-slab casting machine) is reached.|$|R
5000|$|Once the {{temperature}} and chemistry are correct, the steel is tapped out into a preheated ladle through tilting the furnace. For plain-carbon steel furnaces, as soon as slag is detected during tapping the furnace is rapidly tilted back towards the <b>deslagging</b> side, minimising slag carryover into the ladle. For some special steel grades, including stainless steel, the slag is poured into the ladle as well, to be treated at the ladle furnace to recover valuable alloying elements. During tapping some alloy additions are introduced into the metal stream, and more lime is added {{on top of the}} ladle to begin building a new slag layer.

The yield strength is expected to be between 450 MPa and 550 MPa after the hot rolling process depending on prescribed standards. A series of experimental trials during a hot rolling process were carried out in a steel plant in which parameters such as the water flow rate and the processing time were varied to study their effect on the evolving mechanical properties of the rebars. Four “heats”(A “heat” is a batch of molten steel, referred to as tap to tap cycle and involves furnace charging with scrap, melting, <b>deslagging,</b> tapping molten steel and furnace turn-around. Furnace turn-around is the period following completion of tapping until the furnace is recharged for the next “heat”) were done to produce Y 12 mm reinforced bars (rebars). For every “heat” done, tensile tests were carried out on the samples every after 15 minutes to establish the yield strength of the rebar. At least eight samples were tested in every “heat”. It was observed that some samples showed low values of yield strength (< 450 MPa) which falls short of the minimum guaranteed yield strength. It was further noted that the water flow rate in the water cooling chamber was far below 600 m⁄h for this size of rebar in some cases. A series of these tests were conducted and the water flow rate adjusted in order to arrive at the optimum flow rate corresponding to the expected yield strength and microstructure. The quenching time in the water cooling chamber was in the range 0. 1 to 0. 5 seconds and the results obtained both for the tensile tests and microstructure after several adjustments to the flow rate in particular yielded optimum results consistent with prescribed standards...|$|R
40|$|Ladle {{metallurgical}} processes {{constitute a}} portion of the total production chain of steel from iron ore. With these batch processes, the hot metal or steel transfer ladle is being used as a reactor vessel and a reagent is often injected in order to bring the composition of the hot metal or steel to the specification of the final product. To control and further improve these processes, often use is made of models that predict the course of the processes. Models derived from first principles of mass and energy transport have the advantage over empirical descriptions that predictions outside the established window of operation can be made. The establishment of such a model, however, requires deeper knowledge of the underlying thermo-chemical processes. The purpose of this work is to provide a uniform method {{for the development of a}} model of injection processes in the ladle metallurgy. This will give direction to the development of new models, and will clarify blind spots in the existing knowledge for which further research is required. It is chosen to study two ladle treatments and to develop a reactor model of these, namely the desulphurisation of hot metal by the injection of magnesium and lime, and the modification of inclusions in aluminium killed steel by the injection of calcium. The hot metal desulphurisation has been studied by microscopic analysis of hot metal samples taken during different heats. The top layer of the bath, where the hot metal is in contact with the slag layer, has also been studied. From these analyses, it follows that during the injection of magnesium, magnesium sulphide particles are formed which continue to be present for some time in the hot metal, grow and later on rise out of the bath. This corresponds to the mechanism as has been proposed by G. Irons and R. Guthrie, based on their experiments on a laboratory scale. Due to the differences in scale, however, the accumulation of magnesium sulphide particles in the hot metal plays a significant role in the explanation of sulphur levels observed in the industrial desulphurisation process. The measurements furthermore show that the rise of the particles to the slag layer is partially obstructed by graphite and Ti (C, N) particles that accumulate in the colder surface layer of the hot metal. This creates a layer with a high concentration of MgS-particles that remain unnoticed but can lead to undesirable sulphur pick up in the converter process. It also appears that the MgS particles that rise to the slag layer react with co-injected lime to form MgO and CaS. In order to prevent sulphur reversal by oxidation of MgS in the ambient air, lime should always be injected in a slight excess. During the injection process, iron droplets are thrown up from the spout area. These droplets slowly sink through the slag layer and do not make it back to the hot metal before the end of the injection process. Based on this it can be explained how the hot metal loss depends on the amount of injected magnesium, the hot metal temperature, and the hot metal titanium content. Because these droplets are entrained with the sulphide containing slag during <b>deslagging,</b> this presents a major cost in the form of loss of hot metal. Based on these findings, a reactor model of the hot metal desulphurisation has been developed The mixing in the hot metal bath has been described as an ideally mixed tank reactor, wherein the residence time of injected magnesium and lime has been described by a generic model of the bubble plume. An important aspect of the model is that the total sulphur content is formed by the sulphur that is dissolved in the hot metal and the sulphur which is bound in the MgS particles suspended in the hot metal. The specific surface area of the MgS particles is derived from the microscopic observations and the flotation of the MgS particles is described by a first order rate equation. The predicted development of the concentrations of magnesium and sulphur during the duration of the injection is in good agreement with the measurements which have been made with two treatments. The calcium treatment of aluminium killed steel has been extensively studied by W. Tiekink. Based on the measurements carried out by him on laboratory and industrial scale, the steel bath in the ladle is divided into two reaction zones: a zone plume in which the steel is saturated with calcium and a bulk zone in which initially no calcium is present. In the plume zone CaO and CaS are deposited on the Al 2 O 3 particles. Induced by the bubble plume resulting from the calcium injection, a circulating current flows between these zones. Each zone is modelled by a continuously stirred, ideally mixed tank reactor (CISTR). Carried along with this circulating current, the particles are alternately exposed to high and low levels of calcium activity which ultimately results in a variation in size and composition of the particles. This is modelled by taking a population balance of the particles for each zone containing terms for convection and growth by deposition of CaO and CaS. The results of the model are consistent with the observations when it is assumed that the solubility of calcium in steel amounts to 1 ppm. There is a good prediction of particle sizes and composition, but the CaS content of the particles is slightly overestimated by the model. This is explained by the pick up of oxygen at the surface of the steel which is not yet taken into account in the model. The final conclusion of this work is that the chemical conversion of the hot metal and steel during ladle metallurgical injection processes can be well modelled with a detailed description of nucleation, growth and rise of the product particles in conjunction with a relatively simple macroscopic description of the flow field in the ladle. This can best be achieved by providing a population balance of the product particles in which, to the extent appropriate, terms for nucleation, growth, convection and flotation are included. The flow field in the ladle then is modelled using three CISTR's coupled by circulating currents of liquid metal. These CISTR's represent the three zones that can be distinguished in a ladle stirred by a bubble plume; the plume zone, the recirculation zone and the stagnant zone above the bottom of the ladle. <br/...|$|R
