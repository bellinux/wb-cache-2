Five {{months before}} the Olympics, Celski {{suffered}} a gruesome injury when he fell during a race and his right skate blade gashed his left thigh and was uncertain if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to skate again.|$|E
5|$|Marx {{longed to}} return to his {{economic}} studies, as he had left these studies in 1844 and had been preoccupied with other projects over the last thirteen years. By returning to his study of economics, Marx felt <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to understand more thoroughly what was occurring in the world.|$|E
5|$|Benedict Arnold and John André {{finally met}} on September 21 at the Joshua Hett Smith House. On {{the morning of}} September 22, the outpost at Verplanck's Point under command of Col. James Livingston fired on HMS Vulture, the ship that was {{intended}} to carry André back to New York. This action did sufficient damage that she retreated downriver, forcing André to return to New York overland. Arnold wrote out passes for André so that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> {{to pass through the}} lines, and also gave him plans for West Point.|$|E

5|$|On May 9, 2017 Yoshiki's {{management}} {{announced that}} the drummer would undergo urgent surgery on May 16, where an artificial disc would be inserted between his vertebrae. Due to his health conditions, {{it was reported that}} concerts would need to be either rescheduled or cancelled. On June 9, X Japan announced at a press conference that the concerts would not be postponed but instead performed in an acoustic set, with Yoshiki at the piano, as it is uncertain whether <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to play the drums in the future.|$|E
5|$|Once the Thrud strip had run {{its course}} in White Dwarf, Critchlow worked on other comics {{including}} the Judge Dredd/Batman crossover story The Ultimate Riddle, first published in 1995. His work on this story was fully painted, and while considered impressive was also criticised as being forced, confused and muddy. Critchlow was developing a new style based on line-drawings with computer colouring, but having been pigeon-holed as a painter {{did not believe that}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to interest anyone in this very different style.|$|E
5|$|Roy faced {{challenges}} {{before entering}} college. His parents {{and his older}} brother had not attended college, and due to a learning disability Roy had difficulty with the SAT; his reading comprehension was slow, which increased the time he needed for tests. He had taken the test four times (with tutors) before finally meeting the NCAA requirements. Unsure whether <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to attend a four-year college, Roy worked on the Seattle docks, cleaning shipping containers for $11/hour.|$|E

5|$|The role of Sergeant Joaquin Acosta was to {{be played}} by Richard Gomez, but he chose instead to pursue a {{political}} career in Ormoc. Matti later cast Joey Marquez; although Marquez was seen primarily as a comedian, Matti believed <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to portray a simultaneously charismatic and obnoxious character. The cast also features Leo Martinez as General Pacheco, Lito Pimentel as Pol, William Martinez as Rex, Vivian Velez as Thelma, and Rayver Cruz as Bernabe.|$|E
5|$|Apart from a {{short period}} doing {{contract}} surveying for the New Zealand Company in March 1849, Brunner remained unemployed and wrote numerous letters to his contacts. His former travelling companion, William Fox, and Dillon Bell, chief agent of the New Zealand Company, also sought to find him a job and through them, {{he was able to}} find work as a clerk with the Canterbury Association between September 1849 and February 1850. He returned to Nelson in May 1850 and secured full-time employment as a surveyor with the New Zealand Company, but with the proviso that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to take on private work which did not interfere with his duties. To supplement his income Brunner began to take on architectural commissions.|$|E
5|$|Bakshi chose {{rotoscoping}} as {{a cost-effective}} way {{to complete the}} movie's battle scenes with his own finances. Because he {{could not afford to}} hire a film crew or actors, or develop 35mm stock, Bakshi requested prints of films that contained the type of large battle scenes needed, including Sergei Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky, and spliced together the footage he needed. However, the cost of printing photographs of each frame would have cost $3 million. Learning that IBM had introduced an industrial-sized photocopier, Bakshi asked one of the company's technical experts if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to feed 35mm reels into the machine to produce enlarged copies of each frame. The experiment worked, and Bakshi got the pages he needed for a penny per copy.|$|E

5|$|Beckett {{struggled}} {{in the early}} part of the 2013 season with an 0–5 record and 5.19 ERA in eight starts. He was placed on the disabled list with a groin strain on May 15. While on the disabled list he began to experience numbness and tingling in his hand so he went to see a nerve specialist and expressed doubt as to whether <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to pitch again. The Dodgers shut him down from pitching for a month while he underwent a rigorous rehabilitation program in an effort to avoid season-ending surgery. However, the tingling sensation returned when he attempted to resume his throwing program in late June. He was diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome, which required him to undergo surgery on July 10, 2013 that ended his 2013 season.|$|E
5|$|For the 2009 remake, {{stuntman}} Derek Mears {{was hired}} to portray Jason Voorhees at the recommendation of makeup special effects supervisor Scott Stoddard. Mears's pleasant demeanor had the studio worried {{about his ability to}} portray such a menacing character on screen, but Mears assured them <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to perform the role. When Mears auditioned for the role he was asked why they should hire an actor over just another guy in a mask. As Mears explained, portraying Jason is similar to Greek mask work, where the mask and the actor are two separate entities, and, based on the scene, there will be various combinations of mask and actor in the performance.|$|E
5|$|In 1163, a {{conflict}} arose between {{the king and}} the new Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, over {{the rights of the}} king in the English church. At a council held at Westminster in October 1163, the king and Becket contended over the question, with the bishops supporting Becket against the king. Robert was involved in the conflict not only as a bishop-elect, but as an envoy to Becket from the pope, as he accompanied Philip of Aumone, a French abbot, who was sent by Alexander to Becket in after the Council of Westminster to urge Becket not to inflame the situation. Robert went with Philip, probably because it was hoped <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to influence Becket.|$|E

5|$|In January 2015 in {{his column}} in Weekly Famitsu, Sakurai alluded to the {{possibility}} of retirement, expressing doubt that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to continue making games if his career continued to be as stressful as it was. In December 2015, Sakurai once again stated that he was not sure if there will be another Smash Bros. game in the series. In January 2016, it was rumoured that a Super Smash Bros. game was being developed by Bandai Namco and that the game was planned as a launch title for the Nintendo Switch. However, the rumour was debunked upon the release of the Switch.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} part, Lewis Hamilton quickly set a fast lap time, the quickest {{of the weekend}} up to that point, about half a second ahead of his {{teammate}} Rosberg. Meanwhile, Daniel Ricciardo set his fastest lap on the harder supersoft compound tyre, meaning that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to start the race on them, should it have stayed dry. On the back end, Williams struggled for pace and both Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa missed out on Q3 by qualifying 11th and 14th respectively. Also eliminated were Esteban Gutiérrez, Jenson Button, Romain Grosjean and Magnussen.|$|E
5|$|Marcus {{continued}} {{throughout his}} tenure to hold tightly to his father's assurance that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> {{to maintain and}} act on his political convictions while running the business. He supported the United Nations in its early years, an unpopular position in Dallas for that time. In the early 1950s he began to explore the ramifications of ending the store's participation in the then-common practice of excluding black customers from shopping in the store, and while his legal advisors cautioned against that step, he offered support for any black entrepreneur looking to establish a quality store and, in 1954, began to hire black staff in some departments.|$|E

5|$|Ptolemy {{decided to}} try to make a night dash from Citium, round Cape Greko, to Salamis, hoping to {{surprise}} Demetrius and combine his fleet with his brother’s sixty ships so they could then outnumber Demetrius. Demetrius, however, informed of Ptolemy's arrival, took steps just in order to prevent this from happening: he equipped his ships with missile-throwers, brought aboard his best troops as marines, and sailed his fleet to anchor just outside the harbour of the city, bottling up Menelaus in the harbour and interposing himself between the two enemy fleets. This meant that Demetrius took a calculated risk that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to defeat Ptolemy before Menelaus could sail out of the harbour and attack him in the rear.|$|E
5|$|Saavedra {{was warned}} by fellow {{members of the}} Junta, {{military}} leaders and even the Cabildo that if he left Buenos Aires, the government would be prone to fall into a political crisis. He left anyway, convinced that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to reorganize the Army of the North. The warnings were justified; shortly after his departure, the Junta {{was turned into a}} legislative power, while the executive would be managed by the First Triumvirate. This arrangement lasted for a short time, then the Junta was abolished. The Regiment of Patricians made a mutiny against the triumvirate, but failed.|$|E
5|$|San Martín {{thought that}} if he joined forces with Bolívar <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> to defeat the remnant royalist forces in Peru. Both liberators would meet in Quito, so San Martín {{appointed}} Torre Tagle to manage the government during his absence. Bolivar was unable to meet San Martín at the arranged date, so San Martín returned to Lima, but still left Tagle in government. Bolívar moved from Quito to Guayaquil, which secured its independence. There were discussions {{on the future of}} the region: some factions wanted to join Colombia, others to join Peru, and others to become a new nation. Bolívar ended the discussion by annexing Guayaquil into Colombia. There was Peruvian pressure on San Martín to do a similar thing, to annex Guayaquil to Peru.|$|E
