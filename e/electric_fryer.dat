50|$|<b>Electric</b> {{restaurant}} <b>fryers</b> {{are popular}} in counter top models {{because of their}} mobility. They lose a little less heat than gas fryers because their heating elements are immersed in the oil, {{and they have a}} faster temperature recovery time between frying cycles. Gas fryers heat up more quickly and to a higher cooking temperature than <b>electric</b> <b>fryers.</b> Gas fryers can be powered by either natural gas or propane, both of which are generally less expensive energy sources than electricity. This makes gas power especially popular in floor model fryers.|$|R
40|$|The gas {{industry}} has conducted significant research, {{in the form}} of the GRI-spnsored CKV research project, that provides a sound technical foundation for unbiased energy analysis of commercial food service equipment. ASTM F 1704 - 96 Standard Test Method for the Performance of Commerical Kitchen Ventilation Systems was developed in conjunction with this research. Previously published data historically used for predicting the cooling load from operating commercial cooking equipment was not consistent with preliminary five major categories of commercial cooking appliances: griddles, ranges, convection ovens, charboilers, and fryers. Both natural gas and electric equipment were tested in earch category. The intended use of these results in conjuction with data from other similar research, is to update the cooling load chapter in the ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals. The results from this project indicate that maximum heat gains from cooking appliances are significantly higher than previously considered for both gas and electric equipment, ranging rom about 2 to 8 times higher, averaging about 3 times higher. The heat gain from <b>electric</b> <b>fryers</b> was found to be eight times higher. The heat gain from <b>electric</b> <b>fryers</b> was found to be eight times higher than the ASHRAE recommended design load. ...|$|R
40|$|Alheiras are a traditional, smoked, {{fermented}} meat sausage, {{produced in}} Portugal, with an undeniable cultural and gastronomic legacy. In this study, we assessed the nutritional {{value of this}} product, {{as well as the}} influence of different types of thermal processing. Alheiras from Mirandela were submitted to six different procedures: microwave, skillet, oven, charcoal grill, <b>electric</b> <b>fryer</b> and electric grill. Protein, fat, carbohydrate, minerals, NaCl, and cholesterol contents, as well as fatty acid profile were evaluated. The results show that alheiras are not hypercaloric but an unbalanced foodstuff (high levels of proteins and lipids) and the type of processing has a major impact on their nutritional value. Charcoal grill is the healthiest option: less fat (12. 5 g/ 100 g) and cholesterol (29. 3 mg/ 100 g), corresponding to a lower caloric intake (231. 8 kcal, less 13 % than the raw ones). Inversely, fried alheiras presented the worst nutritional profile, with the highest levels of fat (18. 1 g/ 100 g) and cholesterol (76. 0 g/ 100 g) ...|$|E
40|$|Background. Understanding of oil {{deterioration}} during heating/frying {{process is}} important as oils are nor- mally kept hot at commercial food outlets during intermittent frying cycles. An increased level of consumer awareness toward fat composition {{and its impact}} on human health could have an effect on selection of fats in the food industry. The rate of quality deterioration during heating depends on fatty acid composition and also the content and composition of minor components. Therefore, the use of more stable frying oils would be desirable. The present study compares the heat stability at frying temperature of regular sunflower oil (RSFO) with that of high-oleic acid sunflower oil (HSFO).   Material and methods. Heating test was carried out at 185 ± 5 °C for the samples RSFO and HSFO using <b>electric</b> <b>fryer</b> for 8 h/day for 3 consecutive days. The samples were collected every 4 h. The changes in phys- icochemical properties of the samples were monitored by analytical and instrumental methods.   Results. In this study, refractive index, free fatty acid content, peroxide value, p-anisidine value, TOTOXvalue and polar compounds of the oils all increased, whereas C    /C ratio decreased as heating progressed. The percentage of linoleic acid tended to decrease, whereas the percentages of palmitic, stearic and oleic ac-ids increased. The sample HSFO exhibited better heating performance compared to RSFO. However, a higher amount of free fatty acids was found in HSFO compared to RSFO at the end of heating trial. Moreover, heat- ing process decreased the total tocopherol content and higher reduction was detected in RSFO.   Conclusion. In conclusion, the heating caused the formation of comparatively lower amounts of some deg- radative products in HSFO compared to RSFO indicating a lower extent of quality deterioration of HSFO.    ...|$|E
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Alimentar - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaOlive oil is {{obtained}} by physical extraction of olives (fruit {{of the olive}} tree, Olea europea L.), retaining its flavor, aroma and unique chemical and biological properties. In addition to the balanced composition of saturated, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, it also has essential fatty acids, high levels of fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K) and natural antioxidants (tocopherols and polyphenols), providing benefits for human health. This study compared {{the characteristics of the}} portuguese Oliveira da Serra olive oil and the brazilian EPAMIG olive oil, before and after they were submitted to heating at 180 ºC on a heater or used in potato frying at 180 ºC. The potatoes were purchased on a local market. In the heating tests, 100 mL of extra virgin olive oil sample remained in the heater at 180 ° C for 10 hours. During the night they were cooled in a desiccator. This process was repeated for 20 and 30 hours of heating. For the frying test an <b>electric</b> <b>fryer</b> was used, and 500 mL of olive oil was used to fry three portions of 100 g of potatoes. Before the first frying, the olive oil was heated for 10 minutes at 180 °C. After the first 5 minutes of frying, a sample of 100 mL of olive oil was collected. The same procedure was performed for the second and third frying. The collected olive oils from heating or frying were stored in sealed glass vials, protected from light at - 18 °C. Both olive oils were analysed for the acidity, peroxide value, degree of oxidation (p-anisidine and total value), fatty acid and tocopherol composition and thermal stability. According to visual observations of both olive oils, the portuguese one was clearer (more translucent) than the brazilian olive oil, which showed an intense green color, and a dark brown solid particles sediment. For both olive oils, and during the heating process, the acidity increased, 69, 4 % on the portuguese and 44, 2 % on the brazilian olive oil, in relation to the initial acidity. On the frying process, the portuguese olive oil showed an increase of 36 %, but a slight decrease in the acidity of the brazilian olive oil was observed. Concerning the peroxide value determination, in portuguese olive oil it increased for up to 20 h of heating and decreased thereafter, which is caused by the degradation of hydroperoxides and secondary oxidation products formation. In the brazilian olive oil, the peroxide value stayed high after 30 h of heating, maybe because it had less initial peroxide content than the portuguese olive oil. In the frying assay, the behavior observed in both olive oils was similar to that seen in the heating trials. In frying, due to the use of potatoes, which contain naturally high levels of humidity, despite the short frying time, the process of formation and decomposition of peroxides is considerably faster. The results of p-anisidine index indicate that in the first 10 hours of heating, there was a large increase in the concentration of aldehydes in both olive oils, reaching a constant level after this. In the frying process, the index values of p-anisidine increased along the frying process on both olive oils, but once again, faster than in the heating process. The brazilian olive oil showed lower concentrations of aldehydes than the portuguese olive oil. Thus, according to this parameter the brazilian olive oil is considered to be more stable than the portuguese. In relation to the total value of oxidation, both olive oils showed a sharp increase after 10 hours of heating, reaching a plateau situation up to 20 hours of heating. A decrease in the total oxidation was observed for the portuguese olive oil after 30 hours of heating, due to the sudden decrease in the peroxide value. On the brazilian olive oil, this variation was not observed. The same result described above was seen in the frying trial with portuguese olive oil. In the third frying, the peroxide value decreased, which led to a slight decrease in the total oxidation. The brazilian olive oil is apparently more stable to oxidation than the portuguese. The fatty acid determination showed that during heating, due to degradation reactions, the polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased, resulting in the formation of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. This behavior is more evident in the portuguese olive oil than in the brazilian one. The levels of monounsaturated fatty acids increased over heating due to the degradation of the double bonds of polyunsaturated fatty acids. In the frying process, the same results were observed. During both processes the relative percentage of saturated fatty acids increased as the percentage of unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased. The α-tocopherol is the main tocopherol of the olive oil, with initial contents of 17. 03 mg/kg and 17. 86 mg/kg in portuguese and brazilian olive oils respectively. During heating, there was a sharp decline in the levels of tocopherols, especially during the first 10 hours. After 30 hours the brazilian olive oil had the levels of the three tocopherols ( and ) very close to zero, while the portuguese still had trace amounts of -tocopherol (1. 55 mg/kg). Looking at the tocopherols profile after the first and second frying, a decrease of -tocopherol occurred, while the levels of  and -tocopherol remained unchanged. After the third frying, an unexpected value was observed: the -tocopherol content increased in the portuguese olive oil and the -tocopherol increased in the brazilian one. Concerning the thermogravimetric analysis, the portuguese olive oil indicated that it is thermally resistant up to 396, 59 °C, temperature at which it begins to degrade, and its degradation maximum rate occurs at 425, 14 °C. The brazilian olive oil is thermally resistant up to 385, 95 °C. In conclusion, the differences observed in the values obtained in the various tests carried out for the two olive oils may have been influenced by factors such olive trees age, the olives variety, the influence of environmental and geographical process of cultivation, olive oil extraction processes or even the amounts of natural antioxidant...|$|E

30|$|Dried shrimp {{crackers}} {{were obtained}} from a local market in Songkhla, Thailand. They had an average diameter of 5  mm with thickness of 1.5  mm. Crackers were fried using an <b>electric</b> deep <b>fryer</b> containing 4  L of frying oil. Palm oil used as a frying medium was preheated to 180  °C before frying. Samples {{were placed in the}} frying basket and immersed into the oil for 30  s until samples are completely puffed. Thereafter, fried samples were placed on the screen to drain the oil for 5  min. The fried shrimp cracker was blotted with paper towels to remove an excess oil on the surface and allowed to cool at room temperature (26 – 28  °C), approximately 15  min before being packaged.|$|R
50|$|By comparison, <b>electric</b> deep <b>fryers</b> feature {{circuitry}} {{and design}} features (such as thermostat-controlled internal heating elements) that prevent the oil from being heated {{to the point}} of ignition.
