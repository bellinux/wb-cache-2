40|$|Extracts of Echinodorus grandiflorus {{obtained}} from dried leaves by three different techniques {{were evaluated by}} bacterial lysogenic induction assay (<b>Inductest)</b> {{in relation to their}} genotoxic properties. Before being added to test cultures, extracts were sterilized either by steam sterilization or ultraviolet light. Only the extracts prepared by infusion and steam sterilized have shown genotoxic activity. The phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of the flavonoids isovitexin, isoorientin, swertisin and swertiajaponin, isolated from a genotoxic fraction. They were assayed separately and tested negative in the <b>Inductest</b> protocol. The development of browning color and sweet smell in extracts submitted to heat, prompted further chemical analysis in search for Maillard's reaction precursors. Several aminoacids and reducing sugars were cast in the extract. The presence of characteristic Maillard's melanoidins products was determined by spectrophotometry in the visible region and the inhibition of this reaction was observed when its characteristic inhibitor, sodium bisulfite, was added prior to heating. Remarkably, this is the first paper reporting on the appearance of such compounds in a phytomedicine preparation under a current phytopharmaceutical procedure. The genotoxic activity of such heat-prepared infusions imply in some risk of developing degenerative diseases for patients in long-term, uncontrolled use of such phytomedicines...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Euphorbia tirucalli Lineu, {{commonly}} known as Aveloz, is a very common plant found in tropical regions [1]. The ingestion or contact with its latex causes symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea, pallor, skin irritation, hepatotoxicity as well as carcinogenesis [2]. Moreover, the Aveloz latex is also responsible for a few important activities against some infectious and neoplastic diseases. Aveloz latex phytochemical composition may vary according to seasonal aspects and geographic location [3], and it is used either orally or topically in traditional medicine. Popularly known as an antitumoral agent (breast, prostate, lung, kidney), it is used not only in Brazil, but in several other countries. According to the literature, the latex could have a dual behaviour, activating or inhibiting tumoral events [3 - 6]. However, there are few reports discussing these mechanisms. Besides, the mutagenic and genotoxic potentials of phytochemical and homeopathic Aveloz {{have not yet been}} described. Several experimental methods have been used to evaluate the mutagenic and genotoxic effects, such as <b>Inductest,</b> the Ames test and the chromotest. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the genotoxic and mutagenic potentials of Aveloz latex and Aveloz phytotherapic and homeopathic solutions. Methodology: In this study, Aveloz 5 and 30 cH are prepared according to Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia [7], from Aveloz latex collected in the Center for Natural Products Research (NPPN) at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro [8]. The Aveloz phytochemical solution was prepared following the doses used in folk medicine: 2 drops diluted in 250 ml of water and 2 drops diluted in 25 ml of water. All test solutions were submitted to the following methodologies: (a) Inductest: assesses the ability of physical or chemical agents to promote lysogenic induction as a response to DNA damage in lysogenic bacteria; (b) The Ames test: uses indicator strains of Salmonella typhimurium, which are sensitive to substances that can induce different types of mutation; (c) Chromotest: evaluates the genotoxicity of chemicals through the induction of the bacterial SOS system. Results: In the <b>Inductest</b> there was no decrease in bacterial survival fraction and no increase in lysogenic cycle. As measured by The Ames test and the chromotest no mutagenic or genotoxic potentials were detected. Discussion: The homeopathic and the phytochemical Aveloz solutions were unable to produce lysogenic induction or mutagenesis in bacterial cells and they were also unable to produce genotoxic effects, as measured by chromotest. Conclusion: Our results showed that no mutagenic or genotoxic damages were induced by all Aveloz preparations studied, thus we are led to believe that patients using Aveloz as a complementary therapy present no side effects in relation to mutagenesis and genotoxicity...|$|E
40|$|Background: Candida spp is {{naturally}} found in humansÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ flora of skin, gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts and, in general, up to 75 % {{of the population}} {{does not have any}} symptom [1]. However, oral candidiasis is very common among HIV patients and patients undergoing chemotherapy. The treatment of oral candidiasis is necessary once the disease causes discomfort and dysphagia, resulting in poor nutrition, slow recovery, and prolonged hospital stay [2, 3]. Preliminary results obtained by our group with a new biotherapic prepared from Candida albicans (Candida 30 x) showed a great potential to reduce the candida yeast adhesion rate when the epithelial cells were pre-treated. This study is currently being developed with the evaluation of mutagenic and genotoxic potentials of several homeopathic solutions. &# 13; &# 13; Aims: The goal {{of this study was to}} assess the genotoxic and mutagenic potentials of different homeopathic potencies of C. albicans. &# 13; &# 13; Methodology: One part of C. albicans yeast obtained from Brazilian patientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blood [4] was diluted in 9 parts of sterile water. This sample was submitted to 100 mechanical succussions (approximately 3 Hz), using AuticÃ‚Â® Brazilian machine, originating the first dilution (1 x). Then, 1 ml of this solution was diluted in 9 ml of solvent, submitted to 100 succussions, obtaining 2 x potency. This procedure was successively repeated to obtain 30 x potency, according to Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia [5]. By the same technique, water vehicle was prepared until 30 x to be used as control. All samples were prepared in sterile and aseptic conditions, using laminar flow cabinet, class II and were stored in the refrigerator (8 Ã‚ÂºC). The samples 1 x, 6 x, 12 x, 18 x, 24 x and 30 x of C. albicans and water 30 x (vehicle control) were analysed by: the <b>Inductest,</b> which assesses the ability of physical or chemical agents to promote lysogenic induction as a reflection of damage in DNA molecules in lysogenic bacteria, and the Ames test, which uses indicator strains of Salmonella typhimurium, sensitive to substances that can induce different types of mutation. &# 13; &# 13; Results: In the <b>Inductest</b> no decrease in survival fraction of bacteria and no increase in the formation of lysogenic induction were detected independently of the homeopathic potency employed. The same profile was obtained after the Ames test, with similar results to negative control. &# 13; &# 13; Conclusion: Afterwards, we can conclude that these samples are not able to induce DNA damage in the cells tested. So, the use of this medicine does not present any side effects related to mutagenesis and genotoxicity...|$|E

40|$|Although {{the use of}} {{medicinal}} plants or natural products has increased in recent decades all over the world, little information is available on their potential risk to health. Annona crassiflora Mart., a plant commonly known as araticum in Brazil, has been widely used in folk medicine {{for a long time}} since its seeds and leaves are often utilised in the treatment of cancer, snake bites, and venereal diseases, its fruits are consumed as tonic and astringent, and its bark powder has anti-fungal and anti-rheumatic properties. To evaluate the genotoxic and mutagenic properties induced by the ethanolic extract of araticum leaves, we performed the prophage &# 955; induction (<b>Inductest)</b> and bacterial mutagenicity assays. We used Escherichia coli WP 2 s(&# 955;) and RJF 013 strains in the lysogenic induction test, whereas the mutagenic studies were carried out using Salmonella typhimurium histidine auxotroph strains TA 97 a, TA 98, TA 100, and TA 102. Each experiment was performed three times in duplicate and included positive and negative controls. No statistically significant (p > 0. 05) positive results were obtained for any of the strains tested, which suggests that the ethanolic extract of araticum leaves did not exhibit direct mechanisms of genotoxicity or mutagenicity that could be detected by the tests used in the present work...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{influenza}} virus {{has been responsible}} for contagious respiratory diseases with high mortality rates [1]. Some drugs have been used to treat human influenza. However, these drugs cause many common side effects and induce the appearance of resistant viral strains [2]. The impact caused by the {{influenza virus}} has motivated the development of new approaches for the prevention and control of influenza [3]. Therefore, a new homeopathic medicine was developed using, as a starting point, the infectious influenza virus [4]. This belongs to a group called living nosodes [5]. However, its mutagenic and genotoxic potentials, especially when used in low dilutions, has not yet been evaluated and it is important because this biotherapic is prepared from living microorganisms. Different methods can be used to detect mutagenic and genotoxicic effects. &# 13; &# 13; Aims: This study aims to evaluate the genotoxic and mutagenic potentials of influenza A living nosode at different homeopathic potencies. &# 13; &# 13; Methodology: 1 ml of purified viral suspension was diluted in 9 ml of sterile distilled water. This sample was submitted to 100 mechanical succussions (approximately 3 Hz), using AuticÃ‚Â® Brazilian machine, originating the first dilution, named decimal (1 x). 1 ml of this solution was diluted in 9 ml of solvent and was submitted to 100 sucussions, generating biotherapic 2 x. This procedure was successively repeated, according to Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia, to obtain the biotherapic 30 x [6]. By the same technique, water vehicle was prepared until 30 x potency to be used as control. All samples were prepared in sterile and under aseptic conditions, using laminar flow cabinet, class II, and were stored in the refrigerator (8 Ã‚ÂºC). The samples 1 x, 6 x, 12 x, 18 x, 24 x and 30 x and water 30 x (vehicle control) were analysed by: the <b>Inductest,</b> which assesses the ability of physical or chemical agents to promote lysogenic induction as a reflection of damage in DNA molecules in lysogenic bacteria, and the Ames test, which uses indicator strains of Salmonella typhimurium, sensitive to substances that can induce different types of mutation. &# 13; &# 13; Results: The <b>Inductest</b> showed no decrease in the survival fraction of the bacteria used, and no increase in the formation of lysogenic induction, in any tested potency. The same profile was obtained after the Ames test, with similar results to negative control. &# 13; &# 13; Conclusion: We can conclude that this living nosode compounded with Influenza A virus is not able to induce DNA damage in prokaryotic cells. This result permits us to conclude that patients who use this medicine have no side effects related to mutagenesis and genotoxicity...|$|E
40|$|A simple, inexpensive, and {{sensitive}} test for potential carcinogens {{based upon the}} property of carcinogens to induce prophage lambda is described. By using chemicals activated with microsomal enzymes and E. coli K 12 permeable (envA) tester bacteria also deficient in DNA repair (uvrB), the range of carcinogens detected in a lysogenic induction test (<b>inductest)</b> has been extended. We have provided the evidence that, after activation, carcinogenic polycyclic hydrocarbons such as benzo[a 5 pyrene and 7, 12 -dimethylbenz[a]anthracene induce prophage lambda. Three variants of the test have been developed (inductests I, II, and III), which are as sensitive as the mutagenicity test of Ames et al. [Ames, B. N., McCann, J. and Yamasaki, E. (1975) Mutat. Res. 31, 347 - 364]. Inductests II and III provide a quantitative estimation of the inducing activity of a carcinogen. With the latter test, one can determine: (i) the cellular toxic effect of a carcinogen and (ii) the kinetics of appearance and disappearance of active metabolites. For two series of chemicals, aflatoxins and benz[a]anthracenes, {{there is a good}} correlation between their carcinogenic activity in rodents and their prophage inducing activity in bacteria. The fact {{that the majority of the}} cell population is induced makes it possible to test the inducing activity of carcinogens at the biochemical level, e. g., by measuring lambda repressor inactivation...|$|E

40|$|We {{present and}} {{evaluate}} the SOS chromotest, a bacterial test for detecting DNA-damaging agents. It is a colorimetric assay based on the induction by these agents of the SOS function sfiA, whose level of expression is monitored {{by means of a}} sfiA::lacZ operon fusion. The response is rapid (a few hours), and does not require survival of the tester strain. Dose-response curves for various chemicals include a linear region. The slope of this region is taken as a measure of the SOS inducing potency. Comparison for a number of substances of known genotoxicity of the SOS inducing potency determined in the SOS chromotest with the mutagenic potency determined in the Salmonella assay (mutatest) revealed a striking quantitative correlation over more than 7 orders of magnitude. The sensitivity of the SOS chromotest (lowest amount detected) is equal to that of the mutatest and generally 4 - 40 times higher than that of a phage induction assay (<b>inductest).</b> From a practical point of view our observations contribute to the validation of the SOS chromotest as a test for detecting genotoxins and in particular genotoxic carcinogens. From a theoretical standpoint the results suggest that mutagenic potency measured in the mutatest reflects the level of induction of an SOS function and that most genotoxins are inducers of the SOS response in bacteria...|$|E
40|$|Curatella {{americana}} L., {{commonly known}} as "lixeira" in Brazil, {{has been used in}} folk medicine to treat ulcers and inflammations. The purpose of the present work was to evaluate the cytotoxic and genotoxic potential of the ethanolic extract of C. americana stem bark using the prophage &# 955; induction test (SOS <b>inductest).</b> To evaluate the cytotoxicity of this plant, after treatment with different concentrations of the extract, Escherichia coli WP 2 s(&# 955;) cultures were diluted in M 9 buffer, inoculated into LB plates, and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. To assess genotoxicity, the lysogenic strain E. coli WP 2 s(&# 955;) was treated with different concentrations of the extract. Then, the lysogenic strain was added to the indicator strain (RJF 013), LB(1 / 2) (malt/amp), seeded into plates with the matches, and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. After this period, the total number of colonies and the number of plaques were counted to evaluate C. americana cytotoxicity and genotoxicity, respectively. Our results showed that although the extract of "lixeira" did not modify the survival of bacteria (p > 0. 05), it caused a significant increase in prophage &# 955; induction, especially at the higher concentrations (p< 0. 05). Therefore, we conclude that the ethanolic extract of C. americana stem bark did not present cytotoxic effect, but some genotoxic potential was observed...|$|E
