40|$|ABSTRACT: We have {{examined}} the kinetic mechanism for binding of the homotetrameric Escherichia coli SSB protein to single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides [(dT) 70 and (dT) 35] under conditions that favor {{the formation of a}} <b>fully</b> <b>wrapped</b> ssDNA complex in which all four subunits interact with DNA. Under these conditions, a so-called (SSB) 65 complex is formed in which either one molecule of (dT) 70 or two molecules of (dT) 35 bind per tetramer. Stopped-flow studies monitoring quenching of the intrinsic SSB Trp fluorescence were used to examine the initial binding step. To examine the kinetics of ssDNA wrapping, we used a single-stranded oligodeoxythymidylate, (dT) 66, that was labeled on its 3 ′-end with a fluorescent donor (Cy 3) and on its 5 ′-end with a fluorescent acceptor (Cy 5). Formation of the <b>fully</b> <b>wrapped</b> structure was accompanied by extensive fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from Cy 3 to Cy 5 since the two ends of (dT) 66 are in close proximity in the <b>fully</b> <b>wrapped</b> complex. Our results indicate that initial ssDNA binding to the tetramer is very rapid, with a bimolecular rate constant, k 1,app, of nearly 109 M- 1 s- 1 in the limit of low salt concentration (< 0. 2 M NaCl, pH 8. 1, 25. 0 °C), whereas the rate of dissociation is very low at all salt concentrations that were examined (20 mM to 2 M NaCl or NaBr). However, the rate of initial binding and the rate of formation of the <b>fully</b> <b>wrapped</b> complex are identical, indicating that the rate of wrapping of the ssDNA around the SSB tetramer is very rapid, with a lowe...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{behavior}} and failure modes of fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) confined concrete wrapped with different FRP schemes, including <b>fully</b> <b>wrapped,</b> partially wrapped, and nonuniformly-wrapped concrete cylinders. By using {{the same amount of}} FRP, this study proposes a new wrapping scheme that provides a higher compressive strength and strain for FRP-confined concrete, in comparison with conventional <b>fully</b> <b>wrapping</b> schemes. A total of 33 specimens were cast and tested, with three of these specimens acting as reference specimens and the remaining specimens wrapped with different types of FRP (CFRP and GFRP) by different wrapping schemes. For specimens that belong to the descending branch type, the partially-wrapped specimens had a lower compressive strength but a higher axial strain as compared to the corresponding fully-wrapped specimens. In addition, the nonuniformly-wrapped specimens achieved both a higher compressive strength and axial strain in comparison with the fully-wrapped specimens. Furthermore, the partially-wrapping scheme changes the failure modes of the specimens and the angle of the failure surface. A new equation {{that can be used to}} predict the axial strain of concrete cylinders wrapped partially with FRP is proposed...|$|R

30|$|The {{results show}} that the damage of cutting one of the {{prestressing}} strands (girder PS- 2) resulted in 18.44  % loss in flexural capacity compared to that of the undamaged control girder (PS- 1). The CFRP repair of damaged girders (PS- 3 to PS- 10) restored their capacity and exceeded the capacity of the undamaged control girder PS- 1 by up to 37.63  %. The results also show that U-shaped discrete strips or wraps of CFRP sheets of girders PS- 3 to PS- 8 enhanced the flexural capacity even if the girders were not <b>fully</b> <b>wrapped</b> with continuous wrapping covering the entire girder sides. U-wrappings covered the entire girders (PS- 9 and PS- 10) using 2 layers of CFRP (soffit and U-wraps). However, the U-wraps applied to PS- 10 were overlapped by an inch (25.4  mm), whereas the U-wraps applied to PS- 9 were not overlapped. By comparing the two <b>fully</b> <b>wrapped</b> girders (PS- 9 and PS- 10), an increase in the flexural capacity was observed for the girder with an overlap of its wraps (PS- 10). That overlapping of transverse U-wraps is needed to develop proper continuity; even in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the fibers. That is in addition to overlapping the fibers along their length for lap splices, as indicated in ACI 440.2 R- 08.|$|R

40|$|Simulations of {{nanoscale}} {{systems are}} important from the understanding {{point of view}} of the physics and chemistry involved in describing observed phenomenon. This paper presents the results of systematic theoretical investigation of the structural and magnetic properties of gold-iron complexes at small size scale. Ab initio calculations are performed for AunFem with and without the presence of a sulfur atom, i. e., the clusters AunSFem, where n, m = 1 - 5. The study also includes Au 6 SFe and Au 12 Fe in order to investigate how the <b>fully</b> <b>wrapped</b> Fe atom responds to the Au atoms. The study mainly focuses on the geometrical and magnetic changes with a step by step removal of the sulfur atom as a function of the cluster size. It is found that average Au-Fe bond length is increased with increasing number of atoms in the cluster. An increase of Au-Fe bond length would have increased the magnetic moment of the Fe atom, but due to the hybridization of Au and Fe orbitals, the moment converges to about 3. 00 B. This value is higher than the magnetic moment of Fe atom in bulk gold. An enhanced magnetic moment is found on Fe atom even if it is <b>fully</b> <b>wrapped</b> by the Au 12 octahedral cluster. From this study it is found that, the cluster stability is increased on the addition of a single sulfur atom to the AunFem clusters. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to study the application of extemally bonded FRP (Fiber Reinforced Polymer) sheets on the transverse beani of RC (Reinforced Concrete) bridge frames. In shear strengthening beams using FRP sheets, full wrapping is not always possible and in U-wrapping, debonding failure of FRP sheet limits the proper utilization of its strength. Therefore, in this research FRP sheets were mechanically anchored. A total number of six specimens with different wrap configurations and mechanical anchorage schemes were tested. Experimental results showed that a proper selection of mechanical anchorage scheme for FRP sheet in V-wrap portion is necessary for the significant enhancement of shear strength of RC beam close to that of a <b>fully</b> <b>wrapped</b> beam. ...|$|R

30|$|Li and Gu [132] {{studied the}} {{interaction}} of charged and neutral NPs with CM by means of molecular dynamics simulations. It was found that charged NPs had better adhesion to the CMs compared to neutral NPs. Moreover, by increasing the charge density of NPs, they can be <b>fully</b> <b>wrapped</b> by the membrane. Another research group employed molecular dynamics simulation to investigate the interactions of cationic and anionic AuNPs with CMs. The results have revealed that disruption to the CM due to AuNPs penetration increases as the charge density of AuNPs are enhanced [133]. These findings suggest a way of controlling the interactions between cells and AuNP by manipulating the surface charge densities of AuNPs to optimize its uptake while minimizing cytotoxicity which are essential characteristics for any NPs that are being considered for biomedical applications.|$|R

50|$|Work {{from the}} Widom {{laboratory}} {{has shown that}} nucleosomal DNA is in equilibrium between a wrapped and unwrapped state. Measurements of these rates using time-resolved FRET revealed that DNA within the nucleosome remains <b>fully</b> <b>wrapped</b> for only 250 ms before it is unwrapped for 10-50 ms and then rapidly rewrapped. This implies that DNA {{does not need to}} be actively dissociated from the nucleosome but that there is a significant fraction of time during which it is fully accessible. Indeed, this can be extended to the observation that introducing a DNA-binding sequence within the nucleosome increases the accessibility of adjacent regions of DNA when bound. This propensity for DNA within the nucleosome to “breathe” is predicted to have important functional consequences for all DNA-binding proteins that operate in a chromatin environment.|$|R
