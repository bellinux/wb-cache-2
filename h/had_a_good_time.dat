25|$|England <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> {{between the}} Fourth and Fifth Tests. Mike Denness {{returned}} to form with 157 {{not in their}} innings victory over Tasmania and 99 in a 187 run win over New South Wales. Dennis Amiss made 52 and 124 in the Sydney game and Chris Old took 7/59. Denness therefore returned to the team as England captain, replacing the injured vice-captain John Edrich who was still recovering from his damaged ribs, which had in fact been broken, not just bruised as previously thought. Australia dropped the batsman Ross Edwards in favour of the local leg-spinner Terry Jenner. There was a storm {{the night before the}} first day, which ripped the covers off the field and flooded the ground. The nightwatchman had not called the curator, so the damage could not be repaired in time for the first day's play, which had to be abandoned. The ex-Australian umpire Col Egar thought that play might not even start on the second day. What made it more distressing was that a record crowd appeared despite the series having already been won, but had to be turned away. Jim Laker and Ken Barrington were part of the crowd, escorting travel groups of British cricket fans. As it was there was a steady wind which helped dry out the ground overnight, except at the River Torrens end, but the famously long boundary was pulled in with ropes marking a now egg shaped Adelaide Oval. Denness called heads {{and for the first time}} England won the toss. With the pitch still worse for wear he chose to field, the third time the winning captain had taken this unusual course in the series.|$|E
25|$|While Wert {{endured the}} humiliating {{situation}} in Mantua {{through the late}} 1560s, he kept his job: he was to remain at least nominally maestro di cappella in Mantua until 1592. The 1560s were productive years for Wert musically, as he produced his first four books of five-voice madrigals during this time, and his first book for four voices. The dedications are significant: one is to Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba, Duke of Sessa, and in the dedicatory preface Wert thanks him {{for the opportunity to}} lead his choir. (Fernández de Córdoba was Governor of Milan from 1558 to 1560.) During the late 1560s Wert had several offers of employment elsewhere, but turned them down. The most significant came in Augsburg in 1566, where Wert's spectacular ability to improvise counterpoint engendered an offer to join the imperial court in Prague, serving Maximilian II, the Holy Roman Emperor. The next job offer he refused came from Parma the next year, the home of the Farnese family. However he became increasingly close to the Este court in Ferrara during the 1570s and 1580s, without actually becoming employed there. While the two courts were closely connected by marriage and mutual interchange of musicians, Ferrara was a place with a profoundly different outlook from Mantua: Ferrara was progressive, while Mantua was supportive of the Counter-Reformation; the progressive tendencies of Ferrara better fitted Wert's musical inclinations. Wert <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> there; so much so that his employer in Mantua sent a strongly worded letter on 22 December 1584 demanding his immediate return to his post. Wert, however, {{had fallen in love with}} the widowed Tarquinia Molza, the most famous female singer and poet in Italy, who was a lady-in-waiting at the Este court, so he endeavored to spend as much time as possible in Ferrara. This was the same year that Lucrezia, Wert's wife, died in prison in Novellara.|$|E

Rusko said [...] "She's got a kid, a little one year old baby, and we recorded his heart beat. We'd just think of crazy ideas".

Budke from AOL's TV Squad gave the episode a positive review, specifically praising the scene in which Stewie beats up Brian. Budke also {{said that it was}} [...] "fun" [...] and that you could tell the crew <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> making it. Overall, he considered it [...] "not a bad episode. The scene eventually {{became one of the most}} popular videos on YouTube."

[...] Ament said that the band members would bring in fragments of songs, and it would take hours before Vedder could have music to which he could add vocals. He added that [...] "Ed's typically the guy who finishes off the songs...But by the end of No Code, he was so burnt, it was so much work for him." [...] The band's mood had gotten better by the time the album was finished, and the bandmembers gave credit for this to Irons. Regarding Irons, O'Brien stated that [...] "everybody was on their best musical behavior around him." [...] McCready said that Irons urged the band members to discuss their problems, and called him [...] "a big spiritual influence, if not the biggest." [...] Vedder said, [...] "Making No Code was all about gaining perspective." [...] Commenting upon the sessions as a whole, O'Brien said, [...] "It was really a transitional record.

Clint (Bowyer) and Brian (Vickers) were up front all day long. This just says a lot about everything that everybody at MWR has done over the off season – working hard, giving us good race cars. We got off in the mid-part of the race, but had the race strategy at the end and a fast enough car to stay up there.” Earnhardt regretted colliding with team-mate Jeff Gordon, “I’m mad because I screwed myself on pit road speeding. I’m pretty upset about that. Otherwise, I feel bad about running into Jeff’s car. I had a good day other than that.

2500|$|Anorthosis took a 1-0 {{victory against}} Anagennisi Dherynia, {{with the goal}} from Lavorde on 15' minute on March 5. Crescendo of missed {{opportunities}} for the [...] "grande dame" [...] with Laborde {{to make up a}} party to withdraw due to injury or undue relaxation in the last 20 minutes that could cost you. Moderate pace {{in the first half of}} the match, with Anorthosis to press and after he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>time</b> with Rezek 12', managed to get ahead in the score with Laborde 15' with the Colombian scoring after the repulse of a Mastrou on the shot of Rezek. Anorthosis continued the momentum, the Renaissance merely a passive role, with the Laborde 20', Rezek 22' have two other good moments. The Rezek 37' near-scoring after a superb Laborde unstoppable energy, the Colombian taking the baton in lost opportunities in the latter stages of the first part 38',42'. The same setting and repeat Anorthosis to have absolute control over the match and lost two consecutive opportunities with Okkas 46',47' and the Andic 51', Laban 54' and Rezek 63'. In the last 20 minutes and especially after the exit of Laborde (forced change) Anorthosis lost the aggressiveness and speed ... threw in performance. The looseness came close to cost, by Milan Belić (82') having a good time for guests, like Shaka Bangura in the last minute of normal time the match. Eventually the 1-0 remained until the end of Anorthosis with anxiety to celebrate the victory in a game that could clean it up sooner. MVP: Ricardo Laborde. The Colombian returned several appetite after absence for punishment, with its good performance to seal it with a certain artistic goals and actions. The defense of the Renaissance especially in the first part with anything they could to limit the action of Laborde.|$|E
