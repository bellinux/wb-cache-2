40|$|With {{the advent}} of technologies, library {{services}} in higher education face pressure to increase their level <b>of</b> <b>digitalisation</b> {{in order to meet}} changing user demands. While many researchers aim to understand what digitalisation means to library services from the user perspective, there is little attention paid to the employees of library services.

This paper aims to explore employee attitudes towards <b>digitalisation</b> <b>of</b> library services via a case study with data collected from participant observation, focus groups and interviews. The finding suggests that the employee understanding <b>of</b> <b>digitalisation</b> is rather limited, which might have a negative impact on the benefit realisation <b>of</b> <b>digitalisation.</b> Furthermore, there are polarised views on factors of utilisation of digital applications between senior management and operational staff.

The <b>digitalisation</b> <b>of</b> immunofluorescence staining was impossible at the evaluation period. The cases were diagnosed by three experienced pathologists using a conventional light microscope and the virtual microscope. There was a high diagnostic accuracy between the conventional first diagnosis and the second opinion using virtual microscopy. The main reasons for limitations of the virtual microscopy in nephropathology were the missing immunofluorescence staining and sometimes problems in image quality. The image quality of the scanning technology for WSI allows a high diagnostic accuracy and {{is limited by the}} missing <b>digitalisation</b> <b>of</b> immunofluorescence stainings...|$|R

40|$|Many {{theoretical}} models of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) {{predict that the}} X-ray corona, lying above the black hole, constitutes the base <b>of</b> the <b>X-ray</b> jet. Thus, by studying the exact geometry of the close black hole environment, we can pinpoint the launching site of the jet. Detection <b>of</b> <b>negative</b> <b>X-ray</b> reverberation time delays (i. e. soft band X-ray variations lagging behind the corresponding hard band X-ray variations) can yield significant information about the geometrical properties of the AGN, such as the location <b>of</b> the <b>X-ray</b> source, {{as well as the}} physical properties of the the black hole, such as its mass and spin. In the frame-work of the lamp-post geometry, I present the first systematic X-ray time-lag modelling results of an ensemble of 12 AGN, using a fully general relativistic (GR) ray tracing approach for the estimation of the systems' response functions. By combing these state-of-the art GR response models with statistically innovative fitting routines, I derive the geometrical layout of the close BH environment for each source, unveiling the position of the AGN jet-base.

In comparison with the two famous water-tight mesh generation algorithms: Tight Cocone (Dey and Goswami, 2003) and Power Crust (Amenta, Choi and Kolluri, 2001), our method shows a significant quality on the resulted models due to the efficient pre- and post- processing. We choose our previously published online mesh generation method, for it reduces the very large point-clouds very fast and effective, which is suitable for our applications: reconstruction of historical buildings and online <b>digitalisation</b> <b>of</b> small scale objects. To optimisation the resulted mesh, we apply a fast and automatic pre- and post-processing to fill the holes effectively. It consists of six steps: mesh segmentation, filtering of noise, hole detection, filling of holes, triangles subdivision and surface smoothing. The whole process is integrated in one and is performed fully automatically. Validation of our method is based on the <b>digitalisation</b> <b>of</b> small objects with a hand-guided multi-sensory device and 3 D-reconstruction of cultural heritage. 1...|$|R
