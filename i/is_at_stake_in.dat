500|$|The {{question}} of morality plays {{a large role}} in The Monster, especially in terms of compassion and tolerance. Several critics have pointed to the novella's non-absolute stance on these themes, mainly in regard to Dr. Trescott's ethical dilemma in his devotion to Henry, a black man and his son's savior. As author Patrick Dooley points out, [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> <b>in</b> The Monster is that if Trescott is a moral man, Crane has rejected common-sense morality. If Trescott's actions are supererogative and saintly, however, he is to be applauded and admired, but the ordinary moral behavior of average people and the competence of everyday heroes will not have been expunged." [...] Crane scholar Stanley Wertheim also noted the duplicitous morality depicted by the town of Whilomville, which exhibits [...] "prejudice, fear and isolation in an environment traditionally associated with neighborliness and goodwill." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{viewpoint}} on sex education, historically {{inspired by}} sexologists like Wilhelm Reich and psychologists like Sigmund Freud and James W. Prescott, holds that what <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> <b>in</b> sex education is {{control over the}} body and liberation from social control. Proponents of this view tend to see the political question as whether society or the individual should teach sexual mores. Sexual education may thus be seen as providing individuals with the knowledge necessary to liberate themselves from socially organized sexual oppression and {{to make up their}} own minds. In addition, sexual oppression may be viewed as socially harmful. Sex and relationship experts like Reid Mihalko of [...] "Reid About Sex" [...] suggest that open dialogue about physical intimacy and health education can generate more self-esteem, self-confidence, humor, and general health.|$|E

2500|$|Appiah {{credited}} Stein {{with helping}} {{to clarify the}} issues surrounding social constructionism, but argued that, because of his avoidance of some technical philosophical issues, Stein {{failed to make the}} strongest possible case against some forms of [...] "essentialism". He complimented Stein for his discussion of early scientific research on sexual orientation, as well as his criticism of more recent work by scientists such as LeVay, Dean Hamer, and Daryl Bem. He wrote that Stein clarified the debate over the relevance of choice to sexual orientation, and considered Stein's [...] "notion of nondeterminism" [...] to be one of his most original contributions. He endorsed Stein's view that the science of sexual orientation is not relevant to debates on gay rights, but was less convinced by Stein's arguments that future technologies that might make it possible to determine a child's sexual orientation would encouraged prejudice and thus be unethical. He welcomed Stein's contribution to the debate over the morality of conducting scientific research on sexual orientation, and concluded that his was [...] "a rich and rewarding work that should be read by anyone who wants to think about what <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> <b>in</b> the scientific exploration of sexual orientation." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{treaties}} {{were signed}} between European monarchs and First Nations in North America {{as far back}} as 1676, the only ones that survived the American Revolution are those in Canada, which date {{to the beginning of the}} 18th century. Today, the main guide for relations between the monarchy and Canadian First Nations is King George III's Royal Proclamation of 1763; while not a treaty, it is regarded by First Nations as their Magna Carta or [...] "Indian Bill of Rights", binding on not only the British Crown but the Canadian one as well, as the document remains a part of the Canadian constitution. The proclamation set parts of the King's North American realm aside for colonists and reserved others for the First Nations, thereby affirming native title to their lands and making clear that, though under the sovereignty of the Crown, the Aboriginal bands were autonomous political units in a [...] "nation-to-nation" [...] association with non-native governments, with the monarch as the intermediary. This created not only a [...] "constitutional and moral basis of alliance" [...] between indigenous Canadians and the Canadian state as personified in the monarch, but also a fiduciary affiliation in which the Crown is constitutionally charged with providing certain guarantees to the First Nations, as affirmed in Sparrow v. The Queen, meaning that the [...] "honour of the Crown" [...] <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> <b>in</b> dealings between it and First Nations leaders.|$|E

Not only, however, are the ten-and-a-half hours of recognised study frequently increased to eleven-and-a-half by devoting to books the time set apart for exercise; {{but some of the}} students get up at four o'clock in the morning to prepare their lessons; and are actually encouraged by their teachers to do this!

6000|$|But {{the deepest}} {{annoyance}} {{arising from the}} miracles would be the irrelevance of the issue raised by them. Jesus's teaching {{has nothing to do}} with miracles. If his mission had been simply to demonstrate a new method of restoring lost eyesight, the miracle of curing the blind would have been entirely relevant. But to say [...] "You should love your enemies; and to convince you of this I will now proceed to cure this gentleman of cataract" [...] would have been, to a man of Jesus's intelligence, the proposition of an idiot. If it could be proved today that not one of the miracles of Jesus actually occurred, that proof would not invalidate a single one of his didactic utterances; and conversely, if it could be proved that not only did the miracles actually occur, but that he had wrought a thousand other miracles a thousand times more wonderful, not a jot of weight would be added to his doctrine. And yet the intellectual energy of sceptics and divines has been wasted for generations in arguing about the miracles on the assumption that Christianity <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>stake</b> <b>in</b> the controversy as to whether the stories of Matthew are false or true. According to Matthew himself, Jesus must have known this only too well; for wherever he went he was assailed with a clamor for miracles, though his doctrine created bewilderment.|$|E
