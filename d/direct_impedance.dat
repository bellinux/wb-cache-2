These properties can either be a negative mass density or a negative bulk modulus. However, these artificial behaviours derive from the engineered arrangement of the unit-cells, which do not present individual ''meta-properties'', rather than from their intrinsic nature. It is although possible to achieve intrinsic metamaterial properties out of a single unit-cell, according to active control techniques, such as <b>direct</b> <b>impedance</b> control. This paper intends to highlight the metamaterial nature of such active concepts, justifying some interesting analogies between the latter and the theory of acoustic metamaterials...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Operational space {{control has}} a number of de-sirable {{characteristics}} but is sensitive to model accuracy. For heavy machines the dynamics are difficult to model due to their friction and dynamic coupling, thus making full compensation imprecise. This work presents an approach in which a simplified model gives partial compensation via an open-loop feedforward input, pre-calculated in forward simulation. In this way, effects that are difficult to compensate for can be partially corrected without causing instability. Since the reference trajectory is known a priori, dynamic model parameters are tuned in its neighbourhood, reducing the burden of global modelling. The feasibility and performance of this approach is shown experimentally via improved free motion tracking of an exca-vator arm. This framework further supports efforts for <b>direct</b> <b>impedance</b> control between bucket tip and soil. I...|$|E

40|$|The {{acoustic}} impedance at the diaphragm of an electroacoustic transducer {{can be modified}} using a range of active control strategies, amongst which is “direct impedance control”. This technique employs a combination of feedbacks, one on the acoustic pressure {{and the other on}} the diaphragm velocity, to the loudspeaker electric terminals, allowing significant modifications of the acoustic resonator properties of the diaphragm within a specified range. This concept has been specifically adapted to a novel concept of active acoustic liners for aircraft engines within the European project OPENAIR. One of the objectives of active acoustic liners is the achievement of real-time modifications of the {{acoustic impedance}} of a 1 degree of freedom resonator.

40|$|Starting {{with a brief}} {{review on}} {{existing}} methods of impedance emulation, this paper addresses a general and systematic approach to programmable and reconfigurable emulation of power impedances. The proposed approach not only enables the impedance value to be programed, it also allows the characteristics (i. e. type) of the impedance to be reconfigured instantly during operation. Based on the proposed control method, emulation of at least six types of emulated power impedances (EPI) can be easily attained. In particular, it is theoretically and practically demonstrated that the impedance characteristic can be emulated {{through a combination of}} different functions. The systematic derivation of these functions is explained. New techniques that compensate the circuit power losses are introduced. This general approach has been practically verified in several EPI. Both steady-state and dynamic performance of these EPI confirm the programmability and re-configurability. It is envisaged that the proposed method can be applied to a range of functions such as power filtering, energy storage and even power conversion based on <b>direct</b> <b>impedance</b> control...|$|E

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} of static conduction and low-frequency noise {{are carried out}} in N-channel polysilicon TFTs biased from weak to strong inversion, and operating in the linear mode. ISE-TCAD software is used to make simulations and numerical results are first adjusted to experimental data. The physical model used to simulate the static conduction is the drift diffusion model. Results show that the drain current follows the Meyer-Neldel effect (compensation law) and that this latter {{is related to the}} distribution of states located at the interface and associated with the dangling bonds along the channel.

Results underline that the sources responsible of noise in the TFTs are mainly located close to the interface. A noise parameter is defined according to the Hooge empirical relationship. The microscopic parameter deduced from numerical simulation is lower than the macroscopic one deduced from noise measurements.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{world population}} is {{putting pressure on}} global food production. Agriculture must meet these growing demands by increasing crop yields. One phenomenon which prevents seedling emergence and damages crop yield is soil crusting. Understanding of soil crusting and the factors which influence it is fundamental to ensuring good crop production. An instrument which will test soil crust strength in a novel way, mimicking seedling growth, may lead to pre-emptive agricultural soil management which could increase crop production. This work details the process of design, construction and testing of an ascending penetrometer to measure soil crust strength. The full design process is discussed from concept generation and evaluation, using experimental methods and a multi-criteria decision making tool, through to final design configuration, specification, manufacture and testing. Traditionally, soil penetrometers measure soil strength by forcing a probe {{from the surface of}} the soil into the bulk soil below. To more accurately measure the <b>direct</b> <b>impedance</b> a seedling would experience a device should measure impedance from the bulk soil upwards and into the soil crust, mimicking what a growing seedling would experience. Results prove that the manufactured ascending penetrometer with a force resolution of 0. 01 N and displacement resolution of 0. 0004 mm is capable of detecting differences in soil crusts. At these resolutions and accuracy to 0. 1 N and 0. 1 mm excellent repeatability was achieved. The machine is therefore a useful and realistic tool for quantitatively comparing soil crusts in soil. It is hoped that being able to compare soil crust strength will lead to improved soil management techniques...|$|E
40|$|For fungal {{contamination}} of foodstuffs, {{there are no}} fast, reliable, automated techniques to examine growth, nor have any predictive models been developed to describe {{the growth in the}} same way as for bacteria. Traditional plating methods can take 3 to 7 days to get adequate results depending on the fungal species utilised and well over a month for challenge testing, an unacceptable delay especially for the food industry. In this study two rapid analysis techniques were investigated, conductimetry (direct and indirect) and turbidimetry (Bioscreen), with the sole objective being to analyse their capability to detect fungal growth in optimum conditions and in the presence of inhibitory agents, in this case sorbic acid and vanillin. Three fungal (Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum and Pencillium verrucosum and one yeast species (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were used, though only A. niger growth was analysed using both of the rapid analysis techniques. Two bacterial species (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium) were also tested using the conductimetry technique for comparison. It was found that both the impedance and turbidimetry methods provided a sensitive and rapid means of detecting, and, under standardised conditions, measuring the activity of micro-organisms. The rate of response showed close correlation with the concentration of both bacteria and spores in the initial inoculum for each strain tested so correlation curves could be constructed to estimate the number of viable cells and spores in a suspension. Moreover, both methods can be used for the accurate screening of potential antimicrobial substances. In comparison with the turbidimetry method though, the impedance method did show a greater deal of variability and there is the possibility it is unsuitable for the analysis of certain fungal species. In addition the <b>direct</b> <b>impedance</b> technique was found to be completely unusable for the analysis of fungal growth. Despite these disadvantages both are promising rapid alternatives to the standard plating technique...|$|E

30|$|The {{second issue}} is how to release the inner force in the {{manipulator}} that occurs during turning the handle and pushing the door because of the positional error and the imprecise modeling of the environment. The inner force occurs because {{the motion of the}} manipulator cannot follow the position of the handle exactly due to the positional error. In order to meet the positional accuracy requirements, the manipulator must have at least three DOFs theoretically, and specific mechanisms or control strategies need to be applied. Farelo, et al. [25] designed a 9 -DOF wheelchair mounted robotic arm system to open doors by keeping the end-effector stationary while moving the base through the door. Ahmad, et al. and Zhang, et al. developed a compact wrist which could switch between active mode and passive mode as task requirements differed [26], and applied the wrist to a modular re-configurable robot mounted to both a tracked mobile platform [27] and a wheeled one [28] to open doors. Winiarski, et al. [29] applied a <b>direct</b> <b>impedance</b> controller and a local stiffness controller to a 7 -DOF manipulator to robustly open doors. Karayiannidis, et al. [30] proposed a dynamic force/velocity controller which adaptively estimated the door hinge’s position in real time, thus properly regulating the forces and velocities in radial and tangential directions during opening doors. Guo, et al. [31] simulated a hybrid position/force controller for a manipulator mounted to a wheeled platform to open doors. The PR 2 [32, 33] could both push and pull room doors and cabinets open by applying vision systems, tactile sensors and an impedance controller. However, the positional error cannot be eliminated completely. The inner force still always occurs, as long as the manipulator is compelled to follow the handle exactly by a firm grasp. Considering that the firm grasp is not essential for all cases, this paper applies a 0 -DOF tool which can effectively release the inner force by providing a loose grasp and allowing relative movement between the handle and the tool. By integrating with the 6 -DOF body of the robot, the 0 -DOF tool mounted to the body has enough DOFs and workspace to operate.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{relationship}} between central venous pressure values and bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA), which {{may be used as}} complementary methods in the bedside monitoring of fluid status. DESIGN: Cross-sectional evaluation of a consecutive sample. SETTING: Intensive care unit of a university hospital. PATIENTS: One hundred and twenty-one consecutive Caucasian, adult patients of either gender, for whom routine central venous pressure measurements were available. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Central venous pressure values and impedance vector components (i. e., resistance and reactance) were determined simultaneously. Total body water predictions were obtained from regression equations according to either conventional bioimpedance analysis or anthropometry (Watson and Hume formulas). Variability of total body water predictions was unacceptable for clinical purposes. Central venous pressure values significantly and inversely correlated with individual impedance vector components (r 2 =. 28 and r 2 =. 27 with resistance and reactance, respectively), and with both vector components together (R 2 =. 31). Patients were classified in three groups according to their central venous pressure value: low (0 to 3 mm Hg); medium (4 to 12 mm Hg); and high (13 to 20 mm Hg). Three BIVA patterns were considered: vectors within the target (reference) 75 % tolerance ellipse (normal tissue hydration); long vectors out of the upper pole of the target (dehydration); and short vectors out of the lower pole of the target (fluid overload). The agreement between BIVA and central venous pressure indications was good in the high central venous pressure group (93 % short vectors), moderate in the medium central venous pressure group (35 % normal vectors), and poor in low central venous pressure group (10 % long vectors). CONCLUSIONS: Central venous pressure values correlated with <b>direct</b> <b>impedance</b> measurements more than with total body water predictions. Whereas central venous pressure values > 12 mm Hg were associated with shorter impedance vectors in 93 % of patients, indicating fluid overload, central venous pressure values < 3 mm Hg were associated with long impedance vectors in only 10 % of patients, indicating tissue dehydration. The combined evaluation of intensive care unit patients by BIVA and central venous pressure may be useful in therapy planning, particularly in those with low central venous pressure in whom reduced, preserved, or increased tissue fluid content can be detected by BIV...|$|E
40|$|The urban {{transportation}} model predicts flows on {{a transportation}} network {{as a function}} of the urban system containing the network and the characteristics of the transportation network. It comprises four steps: (1) trip generation, (2) trip distribution, (3) modal split, and (4) traffic assignment. The fourth step, traffic assignment, predicts routes (paths) used between each origin-destination pair on the transportation network. ^ Calibration of traffic assignment models is acknowledged as a perquisite to their application. Such calibration efforts have traditionally been ad hoc. They have fallen into one of five categories: (1) modification of the network representation, (2) adjustment of travel demand, (3) selecting the traffic assignment method and assumptions, (4) adjustment of the traffic dispersion parameter for stochastic assignments, and (5) estimating congestion function parameters. ^ Some efforts have recently been made towards systematizing the calibration of traffic assignment. These efforts can be categorized as mathematical programming and heuristic procedures. Mathematical programming has been traditionally applied in the estimation of congestion function parameters. If observed link flows and travel times are available, least squares are applied. ^ In practice, however, it is hard to measure link travel times. Proposed is a generic method I term network loading (NL). This method simultaneously estimates the link flows and congestion function parameters. If equilibrium link flows are used in parameter estimation and prediction, we have what I call the user-equilibrium (UE) model. A particular implementation of the UE model is the Entropy-Maximizing (EM) model. The bilevel formulation by Suh et al. (1990) is a similar approach that I cover in this research. It has an upper-level objective function that minimizes the error in estimated link flows. The lower-level problem is the formulation of the UE assignment. ^ Despite their elaborate formulations, the mathematical programming methods are difficult to implement. The difficulty increases with the size of the network. Human-based expertise and heuristics provide a viable alternative approach. Fricker (1989) proposes the parameter adjustment (PA) method for the calibration of congestion function parameters. He also proposes the <b>direct</b> <b>impedance</b> adjustment (DIA) and simultaneous link speed adjustment (SLSA) methods for modifying link free-flow travel times and speeds. The three proposed procedures require only observed link flows. ^ The three heuristic procedures are tested on two networks, the fictitious Archerville and the real Eindhoven networks. The experiments on the Archerville network are controlled for extraneous sources of error while those on the Eindhoven network are not. The Eindhoven network is supplemented with synthetic data and more controlled tests are conducted. ^ The conclusions of the experiments are as follows: (1) PA is very sensitive to parameter starting values and level of congestion on the network. It performs well only on highly detailed networks. (2) DIA and SLSA improve traffic assignment performance in terms of replicating actual link flows. DIA, however, does not always perform very well. (3) DIA and SLSA perform better at higher levels of network detail. (4) DIA and SLSA can be applied to all or parts of a network. (5) SLSA is clearly superior to DIA. Accordingly, it recommended for use by transportation planners. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The three {{electromagnetic}} properties {{appearing in}} Maxwell’s equations are dielectric permittivity, electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability.

Then we have devel-oped the static and dynamic model based on experimen-tal test results. Classical sliding mode control approach is adopted for implementing position control. Finally, we dis-cussed three essential modes of motion needed for human-robot manipulation interactive tasks...|$|R
40|$|The three {{electromagnetic}} properties {{appearing in}} Maxwell's equations are the electric permittivity, the electric conductivity and the magnetic permeability. The study of point diffractors in an homogeneous, isotropic, and linear medium suggests {{the use of}} logarithms to describe the variations of electromagnetic properties in the earth. A small anomaly in electric properties (permittivity and conductivity) responds to an incident electromagnetic field as an electric dipole, whereas a small anomaly in the magnetic property responds as a magnetic dipole. No property variation can be neglected compared to the others. Furthermore, considering radiation patterns of the different diffraction points, differentiating electric and magnetic variations {{is not an easy}} task using Ground Penetrating Radar. But using an effective electromagnetic impedance and an effective electromagnetic velocity to describe a medium, the cor- responding radiation patterns behave completely differently with the source-receiver offset. Zero-offset reflection data give a <b>direct</b> image of <b>impedance</b> variations with depth while large-offset reflection data contain information on velocity variations...|$|R
40|$|To {{develop a}} general method for the {{detection}} of histidine-tagged proteins, the interactions of the histidine epitope tag of MutH and MutL proteins with the epitope specific monoclonal anti-His antibody were monitored by a label-free <b>direct</b> method using <b>impedance</b> spectroscopy. The immunosensor was fabricated by covalent coupling of the antibody on a conducting polymer coated electrode surface. The impedance of the antibody modified electrode was decreased after binding to the histidine-tagged proteins. The specificity of the sensor was demonstrated by showing that no impedance change was occurred when the sensor was exposed to both of non-tagged MutH and MutL proteins. The specific interaction was further characterized using quartz crystal microbalance studies. Based on impedance measurements, the linear ranges were obtained from 50. 0 to 125. 0 and 50. 0 to 250. 0 μg/ml, for His-tag MutH and His-tag MutL proteins, respectively. The detection limits were determined to be 37. 8 and 59. 1 μg/ml, for His-tag MutH and His-tag MutL proteins, respectively...|$|R
