She swung off at a tangent, rolling until a great slanted slope of rusty iron was clear {{on that side of}} her, while the Shasta's poop was held down by the strain on the hawser. A sea smote her on the weather side and veiled her in a cloud of flying spray, but Jimmy could dimly see a man {{flounder}} aft up to his knees in water with an axe on his shoulder. It was not the instrument an engineer would have chosen for cutting <b>hard</b> <b>steel</b> <b>wire,</b> but the axe is wonderfully effective {{in the hands of a}} Canadian, and the strain would part the rope if one strand were nicked.

An experimental campaign {{has been carried out}} to assess the role of the deposition strategy and process parameters such as pulse duration, peak power and frequency on process outcome. The extent of the dilution layer between the substrate and deposited track, as well as tempering effects due to the mutual interaction between tracks and layers, are studied as functions of process parameters in order to assess the characteristics of the deposited tracks. In particular, it is observed that under suitable conditions hard (HV> 550) deposits can be achieved with minimal tempering effects even in the case of multiple tracks and layers...|$|R
5000|$|High tensile (H-T or HT) fencing is {{a special}} <b>hard,</b> springy <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> that was {{introduced}} in the 1970s and has slowly gained acceptance. The wire may be a single strand plain or barbed wire, or woven mesh, and is capable of much higher tension than mild steel. It permits the use of wider post spacings and is neither stretched easily by animals, nor by fallen trees or branches. It can be insulated and electrified. Because of the wide spacing of the posts, thin metal or wood spacers (or [...] "droppers") may be attached to the wires between posts to maintain their spacing.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{modeling}} method and dynamical characteristics of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes {{has been researched}} for several decades. In the past, <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes were usually modeled as a two dimensional system, which was only suitable for the planar motion. Also, no kink-wave propagation was considered when <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes were used in relatively low speed engineering application areas. By contrast, a three dimensional approach to model <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes used in high energy absorber apparatus is presented in this paper. Three dimensional contacts between <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes and other objects and kink-wave propagation in <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes are taken into consideration when applying the new approach to model <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes. Compared to the two dimensional model of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes, the proposed model regards <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes as a multi-body system consisting of identical cylindrical elements with {{6 degrees of freedom}} connected by space constraints. Impact forces generated by three dimensional contacts between <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes and other objects are calculated and theories of elastic wave propagation are applied to analyze the kink-wave propagation when <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes are loaded with a sudden perpendicular impact by a high speed moving object. In addition, mathematical model of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes is established and numerical simulation of the three dimensional model of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes is implemented. By comparing the simulation results with the experimental data available, the model of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes proposed in this paper is demonstrated to be valid and correct. Therefore, the proposed {{modeling method}} can be treated as a new approach in the research field of modeling <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes. The dynamical characteristics of the <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes based on this new modeling approach are addressed simultaneously and plots of the dynamics of <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes cannot only be regarded as a basis for the further comparative studies, but also can provide some significant and interesting results...|$|R

High strength, low relaxation <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes with minor radius, high tensile strain and good corrosion resistance were used in this reinforcement. The construction process for strengthening with prestressed <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes—including wire rope measuring, extruding anchor heads making, anchorage installing, tensioning <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes and pouring mortar was described. Ultimate bearing capacity of the bridge after strengthening was discussed based on the concrete structure theory. The flexural strength of RC T-beam bridges strengthened with prestressed <b>steel</b> <b>wire</b> ropes was governed by the failure of concrete crushing. To investigate effectiveness of the strengthening method, fielding-load tests were carried out before and after strengthening. The results of concrete strain and deflection show that the flexural strength and stiffness of the strengthened beam are improved.
