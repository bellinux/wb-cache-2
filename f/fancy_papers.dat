40|$|Early in {{the nineteenth}} century the London {{publishers}} and printsellers, S. and J. Fuller, packaged paper dolls and storybooks together in their Temple of <b>Fancy</b> <b>paper</b> doll books. This article examines the tension between the narratives of these works—typically moral tales for children in which a love of clothing is punished—and the accompanying paper dolls, which celebrate costume and dressing up. The textual morals against love of clothing are gendered in problematic ways, with female characters mortified for this flaw more readily than male characters. However, the variety of potential reading experiences offered by the form of the paper doll book, in which picture and word are separate, is viewed as a challenge to the gendered moral content of the stories. Ultimately this article argues that the form of the paper doll book sheds new light on D. F. McKenzie's (1986) ideas about how readers make meaning from texts...|$|R

5000|$|The player, {{an alien}} {{creature}} named Vetvel, must compete with six other acolytes (each a different alien species) for the Shepherdship. Each of these characters {{has a distinct}} personality. Each morning, the acolytes wake up knowing one {{of each of the}} three [...] "auras" [...] the others possess. They must trade knowledge with each other {{in order to try to}} gain enough knowledge for the [...] "mind combat" [...] that takes place every night, which is basically a <b>fancy</b> Rock, <b>Paper,</b> Scissors game that depends on the aura counts for the players involved. The game is won when a player gets eight auras in all three categories. However, in giving away somebody's aura count, the player betrays that person, which angers them and may make them less likely to trade aura counts with the player. Therefore, a player has to know whom to trust and whom to betray, hence the title: Trust & Betrayal.|$|R
40|$|Part travelogue, part {{flight of}} <b>fancy,</b> this <b>paper</b> recounts a {{coastline}} stroll from Maroubra Beach to Bondi in Sydney’s eastern suburbs. The author as ‘travel guide’ points out features of potential interest to two visiting criminological colleagues as they ‘pass by’ scenery of great beauty shadowed by acts of spectacular violence. The everyday acts of walking and talking while {{passing through a}} ‘landscape’ serve to constitute a criminology of everyday life, illustrating {{the way in which}} a consciousness of crime, crime sites, analyses and theories permeates the ways a ‘tourist trail’ might be experienced and seen, myths made and histories forged. The walk starts with the unseen lines of penal force radiating from Long Bay Gaol, before skirting through surfing and its regulation; the ‘brotherhood’ of the BRA Boys; the Hines killing and the politics of self defence; the shark arm case, the Virgin Mary and the Bali bombing memorial at Coogee; zones of the beach and Jock Young’s Vertigo at Bronte and Tamarama; before finishing at the Marks Park ‘badlands’ at Bondi, scene of a series of mostly unsolved and unpunished homophobic killings, giving rise to reflections on ‘ungrievable lives’, memory, mourning and forgetting...|$|R
40|$|In 1942 a {{coalition}} of twenty scientific societies formed the Conference on the Supply of Experimental Animals (CSEA) {{in an attempt to}} pressure the Medical Research Council to accept responsibility for the provision of standardised experimental animals in Britain. The practice of animal experimentation was subject to State regulation under the Cruelty to Animals Act of 1876, but no provision existed for the provision of animals for experimental use. Consequently, day-to-day laboratory work was reliant on a commercial small animal market which had emerged to sustain the hobby of animal <b>fancying.</b> This <b>paper</b> explores how difficulties encountered in experimental practice within the laboratory led to the problematisation of biomedical science’s reliance upon a commercial market for animals during the inter-war period. This is shown to have produced a crisis within animal reliant experimental science in the early 1940 s which enabled the left-wing Association of Scientific Workers to cast science’s reliance on a free market as economically inefficient and a threat to the reliability of British research. It is argued that the development of standard experimental animals in Britain was, therefore, embedded within the wider cultural, societal, political and economic national context of the time...|$|R
40|$|Ono-no-Tofu(894 - 966), Fujiwara-no-Sari (944 - 998) and Fujiwara-no-Kozei (972 - 1027) who {{appeared}} in the tenth century after the three eminent calligraphers, known as "Sampitsu (Three Brushes, i. e. Kukai (774 - 835), Emperor Saga (786 - 842), Tachibana-no-Hayanari (?- 842)) have been called "Sanseki" (Three Brush Traces; another set of three eminent calligraphers), {{and they are the}} representative masters of Japanese calligraphy who started and established "wayo" (the Japanese style) which means the break from the direct influence of "karayo" (the Chinese style) that had originated in China and then later was introduced to Japan. Sari, one of the above-mentioned "Sanseki", was a very unique person who has greatly influenced the present-day calligraphers like us in our fundamental attitudes towards making our own calligraphic works. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to give a tentative explanation for the charm of his art by paying special attention to his way of lije and the age in which he lived. Sari was born to the north branch of the reputable Fujiwara Clan, and he lost his father when he was four years old and then lost his grandfather, too, who had been his guardian after the death of his father. That prevented him from holding an important place in the political world of his days. But he was very good at writing calligraphic works on tablets and "shikishi" (square pieces of <b>fancy</b> <b>paper)</b> attached to "byobu" (folding screens) and he gradually became known as one of the finest calligraphic artists. Only a few of his works are now extant － that is, Shikaishi and five letters. Judging from his calligraphical characteristics that we can see in those extant works of his, he was not a mere successor to Tofu who started "wayo", but he established his own free style with the aesthetic and rhythmical writing of his own. The main feature of Sari's calligraphy has been traditionally called "ichiboku-no-yo" (the style of ink in one streamline), which means writing several characters with one stroke, but at the same time, giving variations to each character, which reminds us of "renmentai" (the style of unbroken line) of "kana" syllabary. It is often said that when you see a man's writing you can see the man. Sari's calligraphic style seems to have much to do with his own personality and the historical background of the age in which he lived. He was never a worldly-wise man and he was sometimes even called "jodeinin" (a loose man). But he doggedly lived up to his own way of life without going with the current of his times. We can say that Sari's writing is nothing but his own sincere attitude towards life itself...|$|R

6000|$|Jo {{glanced at}} the sheet and saw a {{pleasing}} illustration composed of a lunatic, a corpse, a villain, and a viper. She did not like it, but the impulse that made her turn it over {{was not one of}} displeasure but fear, because for a minute she <b>fancied</b> the <b>paper</b> was the Volcano. It was not, however, and her panic subsided as she remembered that even if it had been and one of her own tales in it, {{there would have been no}} name to betray her. She had betrayed herself, however, by a look and a blush, for though an absent man, the Professor saw a good deal more than people fancied. He knew that Jo wrote, and had met her down among the newspaper offices more than once, but as she never spoke of it, he asked no questions in spite of a strong desire to see her work. Now it occurred to him that she was doing what she was ashamed to own, and it troubled him. He did not say to himself, [...] "It is none of my business. I've no right to say anything," [...] as many people would have done. He only remembered that she was young and poor, a girl far away from mother's love and father's care, and he was moved to help her with an impulse as quick and natural as that which would prompt him to put out his hand to save a baby from a puddle. All this flashed through his mind in a minute, but not a trace of it appeared in his face, and by the time the paper was turned, and Jo's needle threaded, he was ready to say quite naturally, but very gravely...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. As {{military}} forces {{around the world}} embrace modelling and simulation as a fundamental enabling technology necessary to help them meet strategic objectives, the limitations and potential misuses of these tools and the processes that use them are worth closer examination. Of particular concern {{is the potential for}} decision-makers to be unduly influenced by state-of-the-art animation and 3 D graphics that make the simulation appear more realistic than the underlying data and algorithms would suggest. The old adage “Garbage in, garbage out! ” applies as much to a simulation study as it does to any type of data analysis effort. In simulation studies, however, it is an even greater concern as the simulation developer {{can take advantage of the}} ever-improving representation technologies to make the simulation appear to be very realistic potentially resulting in “Garbage in, Hollywood out! ” As appropriate as this may be for a video game, or in some cases for a virtual simulator used for training, it also affords analysts and others the opportunity to influence decision-makers in potentially inappropriate ways. Army transformation decisions based upon models and simulations of weapon systems that do not yet exist imply high risk that cannot be mitigated by <b>fancy</b> animation. This <b>paper</b> brings attention to these risks and suggests what measures should be taken to mitigate them. 1...|$|R
6000|$|Now Mary {{had never}} thought any such thing. She knew that her uncle much wished her to marry Roswell, and had all along <b>fancied</b> that the <b>paper</b> she held, which indeed was {{contained}} in an envelop addressed to her lover, contained some expression of his wishes on this to her the most interesting of all subjects, and nothing else. Mary Pratt thought very little of her uncle's property, and still less of its future disposition, while she thought {{a great deal of}} Roswell Gardiner and of his suit. It was, consequently, the most natural thing in the world that she should have fallen into some such error as this. But, now that the subject was brought to her mind in this new light, she arose, went to her own room, and soon re-appeared with the paper in her hand. Both Mr. Job Pratt and Rev. Mr. Whittle offered to relieve her of the burthen; and the former, by a pretty decided movement, did actually succeed in getting possession of the documents. The papers were done up {{in the form of a}} large business letter, Was duly sealed with wax, and was addressed to [...] "Mr. Roswell Gardiner, Master of the Schooner Sea Lion, now absent on a voyage." [...] The superscription was read aloud, a little under the influence of surprise; notwithstanding which, Mr. Job Pratt was very coolly proceeding to open the packet, precisely as if it had been addressed to himself. In this decided step, Mrs. Martin, and Mrs. Thomas, and Rev. Mr. Whittle, might be set down as accessories before the act; for each approached; and so eager were the two women, that they actually assisted in breaking the seal.|$|R
6000|$|Meantime, {{the other}} has been {{watching}} the change of the clouds, and the march of the light along the mountain sides; he beholds the entire scene in broad, soft masses of true gradation, and the very feebleness of his sight is in some sort an advantage to him, in making him more sensible of the aërial mystery of distance, and hiding from him the multitudes of circumstances which {{it would have been}} impossible for him to represent. But there is not one change in the casting of the jagged shadows along the hollows of the hills, but it is fixed on his mind for ever; not a flake of spray has broken from the sea of cloud about their bases, but he has watched it as it melts away, and could recall it to its lost place in heaven by the slightest effort of his thoughts. Not only so, but thousands and thousands of such images, of older scenes, remain congregated in his mind, each mingling in new associations with those now visibly passing before him, and these again confused with other images of his own ceaseless, sleepless imagination, flashing by in sudden troops. <b>Fancy</b> how his <b>paper</b> will be covered with stray symbols and blots, and undecipherable shorthand:--as for his sitting down to [...] "draw from Nature," [...] there was not one of the things which he wished to represent that stayed for so much as five seconds together: but none of them escaped, for all that: they are sealed up in that strange storehouse of his; he may take one of them out, perhaps, this day twenty years, and paint it in his dark room, far away. Now, observe, you may tell both of these men, when they are young, that they are to be honest, that they have an important function, and that they are not to care what Raphael did. This you may wholesomely impress on them both. But fancy the exquisite absurdity of expecting either of them to possess any of the qualities of the other.|$|R
