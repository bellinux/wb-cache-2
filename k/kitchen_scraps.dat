50|$|Bird feeding is {{typically}} {{thought of as}} an activity of bird enthusiasts. People who feed wild birds often attempt to attract birds to suburban and domestic locations.

5000|$|A pet rabbit's diet, {{focused on}} {{providing}} adequate fiber, typically consists of timothy grass or other hay (about 80% of the diet), a fair quantity of leafy greens and other fresh vegetables (not just carrots, which are sugary), and {{a limited amount}} of commercial pellet fodder. [...] However, testing to determine if this hay/vegetable/pellet diet meets the animal's requirements for minerals and vitamins have not been conducted to the extent that pellet diets have been researched in commercial rabbitry. Some rabbit welfare organizations and veterinarians recommended that a pet rabbit's diet should model off an approximation of a wild rabbit's natural diet as a foraging animal. Outdoor rabbits are also happy to eat some lawn grass, though it is not a complete diet for them. Small scale farming of rabbits often feeds them largely from <b>kitchen</b> <b>scraps.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{first time}} that a sink {{appeared}} in a drawing was in the Bokie (慕帰絵) written in the early Muromachi period. The kitchen of the Nanrou temple (南瀧院) had a large sunokoyuka (すのこ床) lit. drainboard floor, next to a stove with a water filled oke and hisyaku (syaku) for washing. This sunokoyuka was made with split bamboo and water would drain through gaps between the canes. Even though in many places a sunokoyuka was made over a river and washing was done, to make a part of the kitchen floor into sunokoyuka to use as a drain was an innovation. This did not pose a health problem as <b>kitchen</b> <b>scraps</b> were meticulously collected and used to make a compost. Few Japanese ate meat due to the Emperor's decree in the 8th century and animals and birds were slaughtered away from a house. Until late Edo period, this type of kitchen was widely used.|$|E
5000|$|Corsican charcuterie is {{considered}} one of the best worldwide. This is due to the traditional production processes, and to the fact that Corsican pig (porcu nustrale), which lives partly in the wild, is crossbred with wild boar (Cingale, Singhjari) and is mainly fed with chestnuts and chestnut flour. Each peasant family has one or two pigs: these are castrated (sterilised if female) when they are two months old. When they are slaughtered, they are about 14 months old and weigh 200 kg. This usually happens in December, before Christmas: the carcass is hung upside-down to let the blood drain, and is totally processed. The same day as the slaughtering, dishes are prepared like figatelli, boudin, ventra (similar to the Italian sanguinaccio). The intensive breeding takes place in the mountains, where the animals cannot disturb the cultures: above all in the Castagniccia, Bastelica, upper Taravo and Quenza regions: a shepherd (u purcaghju) watches the pigs, which are free to search in the wood for chestnuts, roots and small animals, but at the evening they are fed with <b>kitchen</b> <b>scraps</b> and spoilt apples.Typical cold-cuts are prisuttu (ham); panzetta (bacon); lonzu, one of the four pork's fillets, peppered, salted and smoked; [...] figatellu (a sausage made with pork liver), and capicollu (also called coppa). Figatellu is smoked above the fucone three or four days, then put to dry: it can be consumed roasted or grilled. Prisuttu, coppa and lonzu acquired in 2012 the AOC denomination.|$|E

5000|$|Today, {{livestock}} graze in open areas {{during the}} day, but are sheltered in corrals during the night, except for goats, which {{are permitted to}} manage on their own within limits. A similar pattern must have developed by {{the latter part of}} the 18th into the 19th century. Nonetheless, the disposal of livestock waste, which became woman's work, required a systematic way of disposing of it. And, over time, the women worked out a method for doing so. In organic gardening, their solution is called sheet composting or mulching. Over time, the women mixed a variety of other organic matter with the manure (<b>kitchen</b> <b>scraps,</b> harvest residues, and vegetative materials from a living fence or hedgerow) and piled it each day on their garden beds and trees to decompose and become nutritious humus. In the 20th century, livestock among the Fulɓe shifted from large animals to smaller types. Horses, perhaps due to the tsetse fly decreased, while goats, sheep, pigs, and poultry increased, and [...] n'dama cattle remain an integral asset.The tapade gardens of Fouta Djallon have been highly researched by international scholars from various disciplines. This research has revealed that the cuntuuje system has a higher soil nutrient level than any other soil in the region. Almost all labor, except for the initial preparation, is performed and managed by women and children, in the past and now, within each family group. The gardens are important for both food and cash crops for their families. PLEC, a project of the United Nations University, measured yields on 6.5 ha from tapade fields at Missidè Héïré, Fouta Djallon and found that maize yielded up to 7 t/ha, cassava 21 t/ha, sweet potatoes 19 t/ha, and groundnuts (peanuts) about 8 t/ha.|$|E
