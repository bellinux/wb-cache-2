40|$|Thermomagnetic {{analysis}} of magnetic susceptibility k(T) {{was carried out}} {{for a number of}} natural powder materials from soils, baked clay and anthropogenic dust samples using fast (11 oC/min) and slow (6. 5 oC/min) heating rates available in the furnace of Kappabridge KLY 2 (Agico). Based on the additional data for mineralogy, grain size and magnetic properties of the studied samples, behaviour of k(T) cycles and the observed differences in the curves for fast and slow heating rate are interpreted in terms of mineralogical transformations and Curie temperatures (Tc). The effect of different sample size is also explored, using large volume and small volume of powder material. It is found that soil samples show enhanced information on mineralogical transformations and appearance of new strongly magnetic phases when using fast heating rate and large sample size. This approach moves the transformation at higher temperature, but enhances the amplitude of the signal of newly created phase. Large sample size gives prevalence of the local micro- environment, created by <b>evolving</b> <b>gases,</b> <b>released</b> during transformations. The example from archeological brick reveals the effect of different sample sizes on the observed Curie temperatures on heating and cooling curves, when the magnetic carrier is substituted magnetite (Mn 0. 2 Fe 2. 70 O 4). Large sample size leads to bigger differences in Tcs on heating and cooling, while small sample size results in similar Tcs for both heating rates...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Aluminium {{phosphide}} (AlP) is a fumigant pesticide {{which protects}} stored grains from insects and rodents. When it comes {{into contact with}} moisture, AlP releases phosphine (PH 3), a highly toxic gas. No efficient antidote has been found for AlP poisoning so far and most people who are poisoned do not survive. Boric acid is a Lewis acid with an empty p orbital which accepts electrons. This study aimed to investigate the neutralisation of PH 3 gas with boric acid. Methods: This study was carried out at the Baharlou Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, between December 2013 and February 2014. The volume of <b>released</b> <b>gas,</b> rate of gas evolution and changes in pH were measured during reactions of AlP tablets with water, acidified water, saturated boric acid solution, acidified saturated boric acid solution, activated charcoal and acidified activated charcoal. Infrared spectroscopy was used to study the resulting probable adduct between PH 3 and boric acid. Results: Activated charcoal significantly reduced the volume of <b>released</b> <b>gas</b> (P < 0. 01). Although boric acid did not significantly reduce the volume of <b>released</b> <b>gas,</b> it significantly reduced the rate of gas evolution (P < 0. 01). A gaseous adduct was formed in the reaction between pure AlP and boric acid. Conclusion: These findings indicate that boric acid may be an efficient and non-toxic antidote for PH 3 poisoning...|$|R
