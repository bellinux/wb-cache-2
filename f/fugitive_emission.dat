40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a systematic method for estimating <b>fugitive</b> <b>emission</b> from storage tank and wastewater treatment (WWT) units. <b>Fugitive</b> <b>emission</b> is the unintentional release of chemical vapors or gases that occur whenever there are discontinuities in the solid barrier maintaining the containment. While the amount released is very small, continuous exposure to chemical substances due to emission may adversely affect workers’ health. To achieve the objectives, a comprehensive review is conducted on currently available <b>fugitive</b> <b>emission</b> estimation methods. A combination of emission factor, equation and software techniques is chosen as the methodology to study <b>fugitive</b> <b>emission</b> from storage tank and WWT units. A total of eleven horizontal and vertical tanks as well as nine WWT units are selected in this study. The results are presented as precalculated <b>fugitive</b> <b>emission</b> database for storage tank and WWT units. Dimensions data for storage tank and WWT units are also compiled from various sources for estimating chemical concentration. Three examples are given to demonstrate the application of the precalculated <b>fugitive</b> <b>emission</b> database in estimating <b>fugitive</b> <b>emission</b> and concentration from storage tank and WWT units. To calculate the other losses (e. g. working loss and evaporation loss), TANKS 4. 09 d software and evaporation loss equation are used. The typical range of <b>fugitive</b> <b>emission</b> individual stream value for both storage tank and WWT units are found to be within 0. 01 - 0. 20 kg/h.

40|$|During {{process plant}} {{development}} and preliminary design stages emissions {{resulting from the}} daily manufacturing operations are identified and measures are taken to control {{them in order to}} prevent possible adverse impacts on people and the environment. Process industry experiences not only emissions resulting from the daily manufacturing operations but also emissions which are fugitive or unanticipated. Fugitive emissions during process plant operation stage are often monitored because they are an occupational health concern. However the attention on fugitive emissions during the plant design stage is lacking. During this stage the equipment that involves large fugitive emissions could be identified and avoided. For this, methods to estimate fugitive emissions from various equipment used in the process industry are required. This work proposes a methodology to estimate the amount of potential fugitive emissions resulting from a mixing vessel used in the mixing operation. The distribution of those emissions in the environment which are essential to identify the impacts on the environment and human well-being is also looked at. Two designs of mixing vessels are studied for fugitive emissions. Firs t is a closed design where fugitive emissions are assumed to occur under well controlled conditions. The second is an open design where emission from surface evaporation occurs from an open mixing vessel. The method is applied on a paint mixing vessel in the paint manufacturing industry during early design stage and potential <b>fugitive</b> <b>emission</b> quantities are estimated.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} before Australia {{jumps into the}} golden age of gas as a way of combating climate change, it is {{essential}} to have a good understanding of the effect that this will have on emissions, which requires measuring the <b>fugitive</b> <b>emissions</b> that occur in the coal seam gas extraction process. With increasing awareness of the dangers of climate change, the world is hunting for other forms of power generation that produce lower emissions of greenhouse gas. While gas is not a zero emissions energy source, it has come to be seen by some as a 2 ̆ 7 bridging fuel 2 ̆ 7. In Australia an increasingly important source of gas has {{come in the form of}} coal seam gas (CSG). While a number of concerns have been raised about the environmental impacts of CSG, including the process of fracking, in Australia most of these concerns centre on water. These include contamination of ground water, disposal of produced water, reduced availability of water for other consumers and the creation of hazardous waste resulting from either treatment of produced water or drilling mud. There is also concern about the chemical cocktail that can be used in the fracking process. Most of the difficulties in confronting these concerns come from the lack of information that is available on the broader effects of CSG extraction. Very little measurement and research has been done in this area. While concerns about the effects of CSG on Australia 2 ̆ 7 s water supply are widespread in the community, the focus of this paper is on <b>fugitive</b> <b>emissions</b> produced during the CSG extraction process. <b>Fugitive</b> <b>emissions</b> occur when methane leaks during the extraction, processing and transportation of CSG. Leaking at the wellhead during extraction is the most significant source of <b>fugitive</b> <b>emissions</b> and is also the source for which the least amount of measurement has been done. The current default measurement technique for <b>fugitive</b> <b>emissions</b> at the wellhead is the same as that used for conventional natural gas, despite the fact that there is evidence to suggest that <b>fugitive</b> <b>emissions</b> from the extraction of CSG are significantly higher. While conventional natural gas, particularly offshore production, comes from large reservoirs and so has only a relatively small number of wellheads which are very large and closely monitored, CSG is extracted from many small reservoirs. This means that for any given quantity of gas there are many small wellheads, rather than a few large ones. It also means that each of the wellheads is monitored less closely. For every tonne of natural gas produced from CSG, there is potential for more leakage to occur from the wellhead when compared with each tonne of gas produced from a conventional natural gas well. Another reason why <b>fugitive</b> <b>emissions</b> from CSG would be expected to be significantly higher than conventional gas during extraction is that the amount of emissions that leak from the wellhead increases when fracking is used. Unlike conventional gas, fracking is likely to be used on 25 to 40 per cent of Australian CSG wells. The size of the underestimate in CSG <b>fugitive</b> <b>emissions</b> could be substantial. If we use the new United States Environmental Protection Agency estimate for <b>fugitive</b> <b>emissions</b> and apply it to a conservative estimate of Australian CSG production over the next three years then total <b>fugitive</b> <b>emissions</b> are expected to be 125 million tonnes of CO 2 e. This is twice the emissions that would be estimated if the current default factor is used. This is an underestimate of 62 million tonnes of CO 2 e over three years. The consequences of underestimating <b>fugitive</b> <b>emissions</b> from CSG are two-fold: it blunts the efficacy of the recently introduced carbon price, as firms will not be paying the tax on all of their emissions; it also prevents us from correctly calculating Australia 2 ̆ 7 s contribution to climate change. This underestimate may be inadvertently making it harder for the world to limit the warming effect of climate change below the environmental tipping point of two degrees. Under the carbon price, the underestimate also has a flow-on effect in terms of the size of the effective subsidy the government is giving to CSG companies. An extra 62 million tonnes of CO 2 e over three years is equivalent to giving CSG companies more than 1. 5 billion. This figure is likely to be an underestimate; the actual size of the subsidy is likely to be far higher. Before we jump into {{the golden age of}} gas as a way of combating climate change, it is essential that we have a good understanding of the effect that switching from coal to gas will have on our emissions. We cannot do this until we can measure the <b>fugitive</b> <b>emissions</b> that occur in the coal seam gas extraction process. The solution is to undertake better measurement of <b>fugitive</b> <b>emissions,</b> particularly at the CSG wellhead. With better information from more accurate measurement, we can more accurately calculate <b>fugitive</b> <b>emissions</b> and therefore better measure the impact that CSG extraction is having on Australia 2 ̆ 7 s greenhouse gas emissions. Before the government approves more CSG production it would be prudent to allocate funding from the 200 million it has put aside from the Minerals Resource Rent Tax for scientific research on the effects of CSG extraction towards measuring <b>fugitive</b> <b>emissions...</b>|$|R

40|$|Appendices {{available}} on CD-Rom in hardcopy available in Baillieu Special Collections© 2002 Dr. David Hayden CollinsFugitive air emissions from heavy industrial buildings exhibit substantial {{spatial and temporal}} variability. These characteristics present substantial challenges for representative sampling, accurate analysis, plume dispersion modelling and environmental impact assessment. Little published research is available to remedy these problems. In this thesis, {{a broad range of}} interesting and useful experimental, analytical and numerical modelling methods were developed, validated and applied to assist with the characterisation and control of fugitive air emissions from heavy industrial buildings. By way of introduction, building emission pathways were described and existing studies were reviewed. Field studies were then carried out at a number of aluminium smelters to characterise the velocity and concentration profiles associated with common fugitive building emission sources. Many recommendations for improvement to existing USEPA measurement methods were put forward based on the insight gained from these studies. A number of general analytical models were developed for estimating buoyancy and wind driven building emission velocity distribution, concentration distribution and flow rate. The estimates obtained were in good agreement with observations. A two dimensional computational fluid dynamic (2 D CFD) modelling study was then carried out to assess the usefulness of CFD modelling for emission characterisation. The agreement between modelled and limited measured data was excellent. Next typical <b>fugitive</b> <b>emission</b> sources were investigated and mathematical models were developed to help estimate emissions. For example, a generalised mathematical model for estimating leakage from process hoods was developed and validated. Application of the model revealed some surprising and important insights into hooding design and emission management. In addition, a series of field experiments were conducted to characterise a few common fugitive emissions processes and develop improved control strategies. Finally, two studies were carried out to better understand the interaction between fugitive building emissions and the external environment. Firstly, a 3 D CFD case study was conducted to characterise the building wake flows for the general case of wind directions oblique to the long axis of buildings. As part of this study commonly used plume rise and dispersion expressions were reviewed and were found to compare reasonably well against available plume rise data for <b>fugitive</b> <b>emission</b> plumes from buildings. Secondly, an extensive field study was carried out to determine the effect of the large buoyant <b>fugitive</b> <b>emission</b> plumes on the development of a thermal internal boundary layer at a coastal site. In conclusion, this thesis represents a unique study into the behaviour of fugitive building emissions. Many valuable methods were developed and validated and important insights were obtained which will help improve the accuracy of emission characterisation, and reduce the cost of emission characterisation and control.
