5000|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>{{evidence}}</b> is {{any evidence}} that directly proves or disproves a fact. The most well-known type of <b>direct</b> <b>evidence</b> is a testimony from an eye witness. In eye-witness testimonies the witness states exactly what they experienced, saw, or heard. <b>Direct</b> <b>evidence</b> may {{also be found in}} the form of documents. In cases that involve a breach of contract, the contract itself would be considered <b>direct</b> <b>evidence</b> as it can directly prove or disprove that there was breach of contract. Circumstantial evidence, however, is evidence that does not point directly to a fact and requires an inference in order to prove that fact.|$|R

40|$|This Comment {{examines}} why Washington should place {{a higher}} burden on employers in <b>direct</b> <b>evidence</b> and mixed motive age discrimination cases.

Section III explores the courts 2 ̆ 7 modification of the traditional federal approach found in <b>direct</b> <b>evidence</b> and mixed motive cases. Section IV discusses Washington 2 ̆ 7 s anti-discrimination statute and Washington 2 ̆ 7 s judicial interpretation of that statute. Section V demonstrates Washington 2 ̆ 7 s insufficient response to federal developments in <b>direct</b> <b>evidence</b> and mixed motive cases. Finally, Section VI identifies procedural safeguards that Washington courts can employ in these cases to avoid potential problems caused by requiring employers to show that they would have taken the same action absent discrimination. By placing a greater burden of proof on the employer in <b>direct</b> <b>evidence</b> and mixed motive cases, Washington courts can better effectuate the goals of Washington 2 ̆ 7 s anti-discrimination statute...|$|R
30|$|Each article deemed {{relevant}} to the review and included in the extraction tables was categorized as including either <b>direct</b> <b>evidence</b> or indirect <b>evidence.</b> <b>Direct</b> <b>evidence</b> was defined as evidence that provided an answer specific to a research question of interest; for example, <b>direct</b> <b>evidence</b> articles compared empirically the relative robustness or merits of two different response scale types within the same study/population. Indirect evidence was defined as evidence that, while {{relevant to}} the review and the overall conclusions, does not directly answer a research question or hypothesis. For example, review articles and articles that evaluated a single response scale type within the study/population (i.e., a study evaluating comprehension of VAS in cognitively impaired patients) were considered to contain indirect evidence.|$|R
