500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Larry Charles and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones, who directed all of the episodes in Season 2. [...] "The Statue" [...] was the second episode Charles wrote for the show, though {{it was the first}} to be aired. Charles was mostly interested {{in the development of the}} Kramer character, as he felt [...] "Jerry and George were so well-defined through Larry [...] and Jerry, that there was less room for me to, sort of, expand on those personas. But Kramer was very unformed at the beginning of the show and it gave me an area of creativity to, sort of, expand upon. So I spent a lot of time with Kramer because he was a character that I could have an impact on in the future of the show". Richards enjoyed how his character evolved and, after the filming of the episode, went to Seinfeld, Charles and David and said [...] "we should keep <b>going</b> <b>that</b> way." [...] He cites this episode, as well as [...] "The Revenge" [...] (in which Kramer puts concrete in a washing machine), as episodes that really defined the character.|$|E

[...] This was clearly contrary to the published statements by Johanson. After Hovind had been informed in 1993 that his statement was false, he agreed to stop using the claim. When he repeated the claim in 1995, he once more agreed he was in error.|$|E

2500|$|Leno {{himself was}} among O'Brien's harshest critics, calling O'Brien's numbers [...] "destructive to the franchise" [...] despite O'Brien's {{success in the}} advertiser-friendly {{demographics}} combined with his significantly smaller salary compared to Leno's pointing to profitability. In fact, Leno's comment was in stark contrast with his own assessment of O'Brien's performance {{less than three months}} prior: [...] "Personally, I think Conan is doing fine.

2500|$|One element Gerson Saines {{was sure}} about from the {{beginning}} was {{that she wanted to}} work with HBO, in part because of her longstanding relationship with the network through her work as an agent. [...] "But I also knew that by <b>going</b> <b>that</b> route, more people will see it," [...] she said. [...] "When you're trying to make a movie like this, it's very rare that it reaches a wide audience." [...] HBO was equally intrigued by the story, and Gerson Saines credits past and present HBO executives with keeping the project alive until it could be properly realized. [...] "I made a commitment to Temple that I {{was going to make it}} and make it right...I never pushed to get it made until now, because now we got it right." ...|$|E

2500|$|An oft-repeated legend is that today's {{cannabis}} is {{at least}} {{an order of magnitude}} stronger than in the past (and by implication much more dangerous). [...] THC levels are allegedly 10, 20 or even 30 times higher than in the 1960s or 1970s. [...] Although potency levels have risen in several countries (such as the US and UK), the actual increases have been much more modest (almost threefold from 1982 to 2007 in the US) and high-potency strains have always existed, as have various concentrated forms of cannabis. |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-07-27}} Furthermore, potency of seized samples was not tested before 1971, leaves were not distinguished from buds by testers at first, and samples from before the early 1980s (when testing and storage procedures were changed) were often degraded, making comparisons <b>going</b> <b>that</b> far back inaccurate. Non-representative sampling was also an issue. [...] Since most of the increase happened after 2000, this legend can be considered an example of ostension (people have been making such claims {{as far back as the}} 1970s).|$|E
2500|$|On 8 May 2006, then Israeli Vice Premier Shimon Peres {{said in an}} {{interview}} with Reuters that [...] "the president of Iran should remember that Iran can also be wiped off the map," [...] Army Radio reported. Peres, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, drew unusually stiff criticism from an analyst on Israel's state television, Yoav Limor, for talking of destroying another country. In May 2006, IDF Chief of Staff Dan Halutz stated that Iran’s nuclear facilities can be destroyed, hinting at a possible plan to do just that. In September 2007, Israel repeated its policy concerning the development of nuclear capacity by its potential enemies. [...] Shabtai Shavit, a former chief of the Mossad, said Iranian atomic facilities could be destroyed within a year, but has not ruled out <b>going</b> <b>that</b> direction. Isaac Ben-Israel, a former general of the Israeli Air Force, said an attack could be carried out at any time but only as a last resort. Iran's Shahab-3 missile exercises were conducted in early July demonstrating that Israel was within reach.|$|E
2500|$|Stanley Kauffmann, in The New Republic, wrote, [...] "This is {{the scariest}} film I've seen in years—the only scary film I've seen in years... If {{you want to}} be shaken—and I found out, while the picture was <b>going,</b> <b>that</b> that's what I wanted—then The Exorcist will scare the… (shit) out of you." [...] Variety noted that it was [...] "an expert telling of a supernatural horror story... The climactic {{sequences}} assault the senses and the intellect with pure cinematic terror." [...] In Castle of Frankenstein, Joe Dante called it [...] "an amazing film, and one destined to become at the very least a horror classic. Director Friedkin's film will be profoundly disturbing to all audiences, especially the more sensitive and those who tend to 'live' the movies they see... Suffice it to say, there has never been anything like this on the screen before." [...] Roger Ebert gave the film a 4-out-of-4 star review, praising the actors (particularly Burstyn) and the convincing special effects {{but at the end of}} the review wrote, [...] "I am not sure exactly what reasons people will have for seeing this movie; surely enjoyment won’t be one, because what we get here aren’t the delicious chills of a Vincent Price thriller, but raw and painful experience. Are people so numb they need movies of this intensity in order to feel anything at all?" ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{still playing}} in South Africa, he joined Sussex in 2005 as an {{overseas}} player for the English season playing in 17 matches altogether. He then joined his second English county in 2007 playing for Northamptonshire, but didn't finish {{the season after}} being called up by South Africa for the World Twenty20, and he was replaced by Nicky Boje (who next year became captain). The next year his was signed as a Kolpak player, however just before the season started he was banned by the ECB for playing in the Indian Cricket League (IPL) alongside four other players including Northampton's new signing Andrew Hall. A month later after an appeal, he and Hall were allowed to play again, a spokesman {{said it was a}} [...] "unlawful, unreasonable, capricious and discriminatory" [...] ban. During that year, Johan recorded his best first class figures of 7/60 and took 43 wicket altogether that season. In 2009, he was an important team member of the Northants Steelbacks Twenty20 Cup squad that got to the finals day at Edgbaston. During the group stages he won the match against Worcestershire Royals scoring the 22 needed in the last over that kept Northamptonshire's winning run <b>going.</b> <b>That</b> season proved to be Johan's best season at Northants as he took over 50 first class wickets and scored just under 500 runs. Van der Wath and Riki Wessels were unable to play for the county in the 2010 season.|$|E
2500|$|During {{a safety}} car {{situation}} on Lap 160 of the 2012 Daytona 500, Earnhardt Ganassi Racing driver Juan Pablo Montoya's car had a suspension part failure, and it lost control on turn 3, sharply veering {{right into a}} safety truck and jet dryer trailer, causing a massive diesel/jet fuel fire. As it was seen on video, sparks were seen emanating from Montoya's car right before its hard collision with the jet dryer trailer and left driver's side of the truck. Montoya was treated at the infield care center and released. Montoya's report over the radio after the incident was [...] "I left the pits and felt a really weird vibration and I came back in and checked the rear end {{and said it was}} okay and I got into the backstraight and we were are going fourth gear but wasn't <b>going</b> <b>that</b> fast. Every time I got on the gas I could feel the rear squeezing. When I was telling the spotter to have a look how the rear was moving the car just turned right." [...] The driver of the Chevrolet Silverado Crew Cab, Duane Barnes, was taken to a local hospital for observation and was resting comfortably. He was an employee at Michigan International Speedway, a sister track of Daytona. The tracks often share jet dryer equipment on race weekends to help in case of rain such as the case on Sunday, the original scheduled start time of the race. The entire incident took about two hours to clean up before the last 40 (later extended to 42 due to a Green-white-checkered finish) laps were able to be completed.|$|E

[...] In 783, after the emissary of the Tibetan Empire Qujiazan (區頰贊) arrived in Chang'an to negotiate a border realignment treaty with Tang and after the treaty was completed, at Lu's instigation, Emperor Dezong made Li Kui emissary to the Tibetan Empire to escort Qujiazan back to the Tibetan Empire. [...] Li Kui, then 72, stated to Emperor Dezong, [...] "I do not fear <b>going</b> <b>that</b> far a distance, but I am afraid that I would die on the way and not complete my task." [...] Emperor Dezong, who was saddened by the remarks, told Lu, [...] "Li Kui is too old." [...] Lu responded, [...] "An emissary to a far-away foreign state {{needs to have a}} good reputation. [...] Further, if Li Kui, who is this old, is sent as an emissary, then in the future, no official younger than Li Kui would dare to refuse such a task." [...] When Li Kui got to the Tibetan Empire, its king Trisong Detsen asked, [...] "I heard that there is a Li Kui who is the most able of officials in Tang. [...] Are you that person, lord?" [...] Li Kui was afraid that this meant that Trisong Detsen intended to detain him, and therefore responded, [...] "That Li Kui would never be willing to come here." [...] On his way of returning from the Tibetan Empire in 784, he died at Feng Prefecture (鳳州, in modern Baoji, Shaanxi). [...] He was buried with honor and given the posthumous name Gong (恭, meaning [...] "respectful").|$|E
