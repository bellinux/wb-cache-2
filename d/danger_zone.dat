5|$|In 2012, Indonesia has 127 active volcanoes {{with about}} 5 {{million people have}} {{activities}} within the <b>danger</b> <b>zone.</b> The earthquake and tsunami event of 26 December 2004 is thought to bring disruption to the volcanoes' eruption pattern. The 2010 eruption of Mount Sinabung, which has no recorded eruption since the 1600s, is presented as one possible example of the hypothesis.|$|E

5|$|Harry Randall Truman (October 30, 1896 – May 18, 1980) was a {{resident}} of the U.S. state of Washington who lived on Mount St. Helens. He came to brief fame in the months preceding the volcano's 1980 eruption after he stubbornly refused to leave his home despite evacuation orders, and he is presumed to {{have been killed in the}} eruption. He was the owner and caretaker of Mount St. Helens Lodge at Spirit Lake, located at the south end of Spirit Lake at the foot of the mountain in the <b>danger</b> <b>zone</b> at the time of the eruption.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Expanding {{traditional}} time geography, {{this study}} examines personal exposure to air pollution and personal pollutant intake, and defines personal health <b>danger</b> <b>zones</b> by accounting for individual level space-time behavior. A 3 D personal air pollution and health risk map is constructed to visualize individual space-time path, personal Air Quality Indexes (AQIs), and personal health <b>danger</b> <b>zones.</b> Personal air pollution exposure level and its variation through space and time is measured by a portable air pollutant sensor coupled with a portable GPS unit. Personal pollutant intake is estimated by accounting for air pollutant concentration in immediate surroundings, individual’s biophysical characteristics, and individual’s space-time activities. Personal air pollution <b>danger</b> <b>zones</b> are defined by comparing personal pollutant intake with air quality standard; these zones are particular space-time-activity segments along an individual’s space-time path. Being able to identify personal air pollution <b>danger</b> <b>zones</b> can help plan for proper actions aiming at controlling health impacts from air pollution. As a case study, this paper reports on an examination and visualization of an individual’s two-day ozone exposure, intake and <b>danger</b> <b>zones</b> in Houston, Texas...|$|R

5|$|IR's John Tracy (Barrett), who {{has been}} {{monitoring}} radio traffic from the space station Thunderbird 5, relays news of the unfolding events to Tracy Island. Jeff (Peter Dyneley) immediately dispatches Scott (Shane Rimmer) and Virgil (David Holliday) in Thunderbirds 1 and 2 – the latter carrying Pod 3 – to London. Arriving at the <b>danger</b> <b>zone,</b> Scott assures Norman of IR's good intentions, in return demanding his word that no photographs will be taken of either aircraft. However, the Hood, disguised {{as one of the}} airport police detachment, breaks into the unmanned Thunderbird 1 and photographs the cockpit. Scott is alerted by the Automatic Camera Detector and the Hood flees, chased along the M1 motorway by the police.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the South station's demolition in 1996, thousands of pounds were spent on a number of security measures; the site was fenced off, bunding was installed, warning signs were put up and security patrols took place. However, large sections of the fencing were stolen and the warning signs were ignored. Ultimately this led to one man being trapped on the site for five hours on 22May 1997. He had been looking for scrap metal and power cables, and had climbed through a small hole into an underground room, from which he had to be rescued by fire crews. The site was then designated a <b>danger</b> <b>zone.</b> The derelict site was vandalised in July 1999, when people hurled burning tyres into the sub-station, creating a fire and damaging cables worth £150,000.|$|E
5|$|In April 1989, Voight {{returned}} to Colombia to the volcano Galeras after being {{contacted by the}} United Nations Disaster Relief Organization. People in Pasto, located {{at the foot of}} the volcano, had become alarmed by noises and shaking from Galeras. While Galeras proved far easier to climb than Nevado del Ruiz, land mines planted to hinder guerrilla forces dotted the slopes of the mountain. With USGS geologist Dick Janda, Voight drew a hazard map that included several populated areas within the <b>danger</b> <b>zone.</b> Before Voight left Galeras, the volcano underwent an unexpected phreatic eruption, which Voight and his team failed to predict. Although Pasto was unaffected, six scientists attending a United Nations workshop for natural disaster relief were killed. After reviewing deformation data from the day before the eruption, Voight discovered that no acceleration in the deformation process had occurred. He surmised that phreatic eruptions do not exhibit an acceleration in deformation before taking place and left after confirming that the volcano's monitoring system functioned properly.|$|E

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I study {{corruption in}} the public sector in Sweden, a country which the literature regards as having few corruption problems. Sweden is therefore classified as a “least corrupt” case, and such countries are seldom studied in corruption research. My work is thus an effort to fill a gap in the literature. This research is also motivated by a conviction that such a case provides a fertile ground for studying <b>danger</b> <b>zones</b> for corruption. For example, this work allows me to explore how institutional and contextual changes impact on corruption and <b>danger</b> <b>zones.</b> Though the main focus of this work is on Sweden, I also have comparative ambitions. First, I locate Sweden in a cross-national context. I then study corruption in Sweden using a comparative methodology and with an eye to international comparisons. I apply a combined theoretical approach and a multi-method investigation based on several empirical sources and both quantitative and qualitative techniques. This research strategy enables me to capture a phenomenon (corruption) that is more difficult to identify in countries with relatively few obvious corruption scandals than it is in countries in which the phenomenon has traditionally been studied. Regarding <b>danger</b> <b>zones</b> for corruption, the results show that some of the zones identified in the international literature, such as public procurement, are also important in Sweden. For the Swedish case, my empirical research also identifies the types of corruption that occur, perceptions of <b>danger</b> <b>zones</b> and corruption, how corruption changes over time, and how corruption is fought. With regard to the latter, one conclusion is that ingrained (male) sub-cultures can be problematic and may need to be opened up using a combination of measures like promoting a more heterogeneous group of politicians, creating more transparent proceedings in decision groups and conducting more effective audits. The research also highlights the importance of adapting control measures to existing structures of delegation. For example, if delegation arrangements are changed to improve efficiency and cut costs, new accountability measures may be necessary. In general, delegation and control structures should be structured {{in such a way as}} to make the cost of shirking quite high. Finally, based on the results of this multi-method investigation, I conclude that one avenue for further corruption research is to connect our knowledge of <b>danger</b> <b>zones</b> to what we know about mechanisms effecting corrupt behaviour, and then to apply this to discussions of new models of the politics of management in multi-level governance...|$|R

25|$|Seabirds use {{the islands}} as resting, breeding, and {{wintering}} sites. Species found here include streaked shearwater (Calonectris leucomelas), brown booby (Sula leucogaster), red-footed booby (S. sula), great crested tern (Sterna bergii), and white tern (Gygis alba). Little {{information is available}} regarding {{the current status of}} the islands' seabird populations, though it is likely that birds may divert nesting sites to smaller, less disturbed islands. Bird eggs cover the majority of Song Tu, a small island in the eastern <b>Danger</b> <b>Zone.</b> A variety of cetaceans such as dolphins, orcas, pilot whales, and sperm whales are also present around the islands.|$|E
25|$|During {{emergencies}} where {{evacuation of}} a heavily populated area is required, local authorities may institute contraflow lane reversal, {{in which all}} lanes of a road lead away from a <b>danger</b> <b>zone</b> regardless of their original flow. Aside from emergencies, contraflow may {{also be used to}} ease traffic congestion during rush hour or {{at the end of a}} sports event (where a large number of cars are leaving the venue at the same time). For example, the six lanes of the Lincoln Tunnel can be changed from three inbound and three outbound to a two/four configuration depending on traffic volume. The Brazilian highways Rodovia dos Imigrantes and Rodovia Anchieta connect São Paulo to the Atlantic coast. Almost all lanes of both highways are usually reversed during weekends to allow for heavy seaside traffic. The reversibility of the highways requires many additional highway ramps and complicated interchanges.|$|E
