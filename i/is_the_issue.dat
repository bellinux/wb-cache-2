5|$|A {{common theme}} {{throughout}} Zobel's work <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach {{is possible and}} easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.|$|E
5|$|Complicating {{the account}} of this period <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of the Peace of Callias, which {{allegedly}} ended hostilities between the Greeks and the Persians. The very existence of the treaty is hotly disputed, and its particulars and negotiation are ambiguous. Ernst Badian believes that a peace between Athens and Persia was first ratified in 463 BC (making the Athenian interventions in Egypt and Cyprus violations of the peace), and renegotiated {{at the conclusion of}} the campaign in Cyprus, taking force again by 449–448BC.|$|E
5|$|The term double burden {{arises from}} the fact that many women, as well as some men, are {{responsible}} for both domestic labor and paid labor. However, due to the thinking that a woman's time spent in domestic work is more valuable than a woman's time spent doing paid work, and that a man's time spent doing paid work is more valuable than a man's time spent doing domestic work, there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of women having to do a large amount of both paid and unpaid work, leading to the double burden. Some alternative terms for double burden include : double day, second shift, and double duty.|$|E

25|$|Environmentally {{sustainable}} design concepts also include aspects {{related to the}} commercial and residential heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) industry. Among several considerations, one of the topics attended to <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of indoor air quality throughout the design and construction stages of a building's life.|$|E
50|$|Each <b>issue</b> of <b>the</b> {{magazine}} had a {{theme that}} was typically associated with the calendar month. <b>The</b> December <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Holiday <b>issue,</b> while <b>the</b> January <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Beginners <b>issue</b> and <b>was</b> meant as {{an introduction to the}} CoCo world for readers who had received a Color Computer for Christmas. August <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Games <b>issue,</b> September <b>was</b> Education, November was Telecommunications, and July <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Anniversary <b>issue.</b>|$|R

25|$|The TAKS test's grading {{standards}} {{have come under}} fire, as some deem them to be too easy. In addition, hundreds of schools throughout Texas have been investigated and audited by the Texas Education Association due to suspicious scoring discrepancies. Also, there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> with teachers teaching to the TAKS test, instead of the standard Texas curriculum.|$|E
25|$|Newcastle City Council {{has worked}} with the {{university}} to tackle local issues. One such <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> to make public service cuts fair in times of austerity. Chris Brink, former Vice-Chancellor at the university chaired the Newcastle Fairness Commission to decide how the concept of 'fairness' could be implemented with the full support of the community.|$|E
25|$|Results {{can also}} depend heavily on sample {{preparation}} {{and how it}} was run/introduced. An important example <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of which matrix is used for MALDI spotting, since much of the energetics of the desorption/ionization event is controlled by the matrix rather than the laser power. Sometimes samples are spiked with sodium or another ion-carrying species to produce adducts rather than a protonated species.|$|E
50|$|Collaterals can be first-, second- or third-line. First-line {{collaterals}} <b>are</b> <b>the</b> {{descendants of}} the deceased’s parents, i.e., the deceased’s siblings and nieces and nephews. Second-line collaterals <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of <b>the</b> grandparents not including the parents, which includes uncles and aunts, and first cousins. Likewise, third-line collaterals <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of great-grandparents not including grandparents and parents, and so on.|$|R

25|$|Similar to {{the issue}} of a point of {{reference}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of orientation: a displacement in 2 or 3 dimensions is not just a length, but is a length together with a direction. (This issue does not arise in 1 dimension, or rather is equivalent to the distinction between positive and negative.) Thus, to compare or combine two dimensional quantities in a multi-dimensional space, one also needs an orientation: they need to be compared to a frame of reference.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the major}} {{complications}} in studying hydrogen isotopes <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of exchangeability. At many time scales, ranging from hours to geological epochs, scientists have to consider if the hydrogen moieties in studied molecules are the original species or if they represent exchange with water or mineral hydrogen near by. Research {{in this area is}} still inconclusive in regards to rates of exchange, but it is generally understood that hydrogen exchange complicates the preservation of information in isotope studies.|$|E
25|$|A {{perennial}} {{debate in}} Evanston <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of Northwestern University's {{status as a}} tax-exempt institution. In the founding charter of Northwestern University, signed in 1851, the state granted the school an exemption from paying property taxes, and unlike other well-off private universities with statutory exemptions, it provides its own police services, but not firefighter/paramedic services. It pays water, sewer, communications, real property transfer taxes, and building permit fees, but not property taxes. Northwestern does not make Payments in Lieu of Taxes for the real estate it removes from property tax rolls.|$|E

25|$|There is a fake comic in {{circulation}} which features Yugoslav lifetime president Josip Broz Tito {{in a story}} line {{in one of the}} issues. Tito is portrayed as Number One's old acquaintance who often engaged in shady activities. The entire issue was allegedly banned from publishing in Yugoslavia. The fake issue was published decades later after the country disintegrated. However, apart from decent drawing of fake characters, and borrowed dialogue from various issues, giveaway <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> number (#39), which in fact is a comic called Belle Epoque.|$|E
25|$|Females show a {{stronger}} McGurk effect than males. Women show significantly greater visual influence on auditory speech than men did for brief visual stimuli, but no difference is apparent for full stimuli. Another aspect regarding gender <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of male faces and voices as stimuli {{in comparison to}} female faces and voices as stimuli. Although, {{there is no difference}} in the strength of the McGurk effect for either situation. If a male face is dubbed with a female voice, or vice versa, there is still no difference in strength of the McGurk effect. Knowing that the voice you hear is different from the face you see – even if different genders – doesn’t eliminate the McGurk effect.|$|E
25|$|Outcomes have {{generally}} indicated that early onset of puberty in girls can be psychologically damaging. The {{main reason for}} this detrimental effect <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of body image. As they physically develop, gaining weight in several areas of the body, early-maturing girls usually look larger than girls {{who have not yet}} entered puberty. A result of the social pressure to be thin, the early-maturing girls develop a negative view of their body image. In addition, boys may tease the girls about their visible breasts, forcing the early-maturing girl to hide her breasts by dressing differently. Embarrassment about a more developed body may also result in the refusal to undress for gym. These experiences lead to lower self-esteem, more depression and poorer body image in these early-maturing girls.|$|E

25|$|Further critiques {{have emerged}} from feminist, constructionist and discursive sources. Key to these <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of power. In this regard there is a concern that clients are persuaded—both {{inside and outside the}} {{consulting}} room—to understand themselves and their difficulties in ways that are consistent with therapeutic ideas. This means that alternative ideas (e.g., feminist, economic, spiritual) are sometimes implicitly undermined. Critics suggest that we idealize the situation when we think of therapy only as a helping relationship—arguing instead that it is fundamentally a political practice, in that some cultural ideas and practices are supported while others are undermined or disqualified, and that while it is seldom intended, the therapist–client relationship always participates in society's power relations and political dynamics. A noted academic who espoused this criticism was Michel Foucault.|$|E
25|$|One {{of several}} {{issues that have}} risen from the {{controversy}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of blood lineage and government records in regards to determining tribal membership. Historians have noted that before the Dawes Commission, the Cherokee have included people from previous rolls and people of non-Cherokee descent {{as members of the}} nation, from former captives to members by adoption. The Delaware and Shawnee tribes, two non-Cherokee tribes, are members of the Cherokee Nation via the Delaware Agreement of 1867 and the Shawnee Agreement of 1869. Another issue is that of a tribe's breaking a treaty protected by Article Six of the United States Constitution. Daniel F. Littlefield Jr., director of the Sequoyah Research Center at the University of Arkansas-Little Rock, stated that the Treaty of 1866 granted freedmen their rights as citizens, and the case should not be made into a racial issue.|$|E
25|$|The {{generality}} of the characterisation {{process is}} not and cannot be wholly scientific. It is always a matter of interpretation. For example, if A, who is a national of Arcadia, dies having made a valid local will and leaves land situated in Barsoom to C, who is domiciled in Catilage, how <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> to be classified? One might say that any rights that C might have are vested by the will that was made in Arcadia, the lex loci actus. Equally, the right to succeed to title might be an aspect of C's status as the oldest surviving male heir under Cartilagean law, the lex loci domicilii. Also, {{it may be a}} matter for the law of Barsoom since all matters of title to land must be adjusted by the lex situs, as the law of the place of the land. Thus, completely different judgments might result depending on how the forum court characterises the action.|$|E
