25|$|The term harbour salvage {{refers to}} the salvage of vessels {{stranded}} or sunk in sheltered waters. Such vessels are not normally {{subject to the same}} deterioration caused by marine and weather conditions as offshore salvage vessels are. In addition, unless the vessel to be salvaged is obstructing navigation, then {{there is no need to}} work as swiftly as in offshore salvage. Also, harbour pre-salvage survey and planning stages tend to be less time consuming and environmentally dependent. It is also easier to gain access to local labour resources and heavy equipment such as <b>floating</b> <b>cranes</b> and barges.|$|E

2500|$|The {{refloating}} {{of ships}} stranded or sunk in exposed waters is called offshore salvage. In {{this type of}} salvage, vessels are exposed to waves, currents and weather and are the most vulnerable and difficult to work on. They also tend to deteriorate more rapidly than such vessels in protected harbors. Offshore salvage may provide only a short window of opportunity for the salvage team due to unusually high tide or inclement weather for instance. The work window may not come around again {{for as long as}} weeks or months and in the interim, the vessel will continue to deteriorate. As a result, it is often imperative to work quickly. Typically, offshore salvage is conducted from pre-outfitted salvage tugs and other tugboats. In addition, portable diving facilities may be transported by helicopter or small boat to the work area. From a tactical point of view, working in unprotected waters is less hospitable for <b>floating</b> <b>cranes,</b> construction tenders, dredges and equipment barges. Plus, {{it is often difficult to}} depend upon a stable workforce (welders, carpenters, etc.) as all personnel must be present on site for the duration ...|$|E

Some <b>floating</b> <b>cranes</b> are mounted on pontoons, others are specialized crane barges with a lifting capacity exceeding 10000 ST and have been used to transport entire bridge sections. <b>Floating</b> <b>cranes</b> have also been used to salvage sunken ships.|$|E

A 1,300 ton <b>floating</b> <b>crane</b> was used to install the caisson foundations, which was cheaper and did not interfere with shipping at the site. Cast-in-place {{concrete piles}} were chosen for PY2 because the shallow depth of just 3.9m restricted access by the <b>floating</b> <b>crane.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Harvard Historian Jorge Domínguez {{states that}} Operation Mongoose's scope {{included}} sabotage actions against a railway bridge, petroleum storage facilities, a molasses storage container, a petroleum refinery, a power plant, a sawmill, and a <b>floating</b> <b>crane.</b> Domínguez states that [...] "only once in [...] thousand pages of documentation did a US official raise something that resembled a faint moral objection to US government sponsored terrorism."

40|$|Many {{activities}} {{present in}} the offshore technology are affected by sea waves and their safety strongly depends on the sea state. The fundamental question in operation risk analysis is the limit sea state which enables the safe operation controlled in all phases: from the sea surface to the sea bottom. The safe limit sea state is especially important when some lifting operation is performed in sea waves. This paper presents a dynamical model of a <b>floating</b> <b>crane</b> in sea waves with a hanging load at a high altitude above sea level. The model {{is defined as a}} linearized coupled double pendulum where the usual 6 DOF of the <b>floating</b> <b>crane</b> oscillatory motions in waves are extended by additional 3 DOF of the swinging load. The numerical model of the <b>floating</b> <b>crane</b> is calibrated and tuned according to the measured model in a towing tank. The significant values of the crane boom top accelerations were estimated for the given design sea state with different vertical load positions. The problem is illustrated by the example of a <b>floating</b> <b>crane</b> consisting of a simple single pontoon with an ordinary land crane mounted on the deck. The reliability of the proposed method is evaluated on the basis of correlation between the calculated and measured data.
