Friction coefficient and lubricating film thickness {{of a series of}} commercially available bearing greases and their bled oils were measured in laboratory tribometers. Test greases were selected to cover a wide spectrum of thickener and base oil types, and base oil viscosities. The trends in measured friction coefficients were analysed in relation to <b>grease</b> <b>composition</b> in an attempt to establish the relative influence of individual grease components on friction. Two distinct operating regions with markedly different friction behaviour are identified for each grease. At relatively high speeds the greases behave approximately as their bled/base oils, while in the low speed region the frictional response is very dependent on their thickener type and properties of the lubricating film. Low viscosity, synthetic base oil seems to offer efficiency advantages in the high speed region regardless of thickener used, while the choice of thickener type is significant under low speed conditions...|$|E
40|$|Context: Oils {{and butter}} of seed from Brazilian {{biodiversity}} are extending {{the range of}} innovative products for cosmetics development. They have a fat potential similar to skin composition, leading to the improved performance of these product. Aims: Improve the emulsions spreadability through prior screening of <b>grease</b> <b>composition</b> and studying the viscosity, and the emulsions accelerated stability. Methods: Emulsions were formulated using oils from semiarid plants from Bahia: Syagrus coronate, Pachira retusa, and Pachira aquatica, so as to compare them with oils already standard {{in the production of}} cosmetics. Spreadability and stability tests were made comparing the results. The same criteria were used with Amazon seed butter: Virola surinamensis, Butyrospermum parkii, Astrocaryum murumuru, Theobroma cacao and Theobroma grandiflorum. For the emulsions screening and performance, a system was developed for oil/ butter, following tests of accelerated stability, viscosity, and spreadability. Results: The combined system of spreadability was optimized using screening. Emollients containing oleic and palmitic acids, and light chain fatty acids obtained good spreadability. The oil emulsion containing Pachira retusa and Virola surinamensis butter had a higher viscosity. Conclusions: With high content of fatty acids such as oleic, palmitic or the light chain fatty acids obtain an appropriated appearance, texture, and spreadability for cosmetic use. Thus, oils with a low fatty acid content may be combined with butter that have a high fatty acid content and vice-versa. Analyzing and strategically combining <b>grease</b> <b>composition,</b> one can optimize the performance of cosmetic formulations...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{environmental}} demands {{push the}} limits of lubrication of machine elements, towards thinner films, higher operating temperatures, lower friction and higher durability. In this context {{the need for a}} better understanding of the physical and chemical processes which take places at intimate, molecular levels of rubbing surfaces, becomes crucial. Grease have important advantages over oil lubricants such as lower lubricant losses, better corrosion protection, improved sealing, easy to handle and the elimination of complex and costly oil supply system. At the same time the complex nature of lubricating grease is little understood and only little knowledge about its chemistry and physics is accessible. In the present paper the relation between lubricating <b>grease</b> <b>composition</b> and characteristics and the cavitation length of point EHD contacts was evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Tribological {{behavior}} of de-agglomerated and exfoliated active molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2) nanosheets as additives in lithium based grease was investigated. MoS 2 nanosheets were prepared by mechano-chemical {{process in a}} planetary ball mill with selective organic molecules particularly lecithin (a source of phosphorus (exfoliating/stabilizing agent)) along with antiwear additives (ZDDP). Tribological evolutions show significant influence of MoS 2 nanosheets on the friction coefficient, WSD (wear scar diameter) and extreme pressure properties of lithium based <b>grease.</b> The elemental <b>composition</b> analysis of the wear track shows the presence of Mo, S, and P on the surface protective layer, revealing {{the formation of a}} tribofilm containing MoS 2 nanosheets along with phosphorus based moieties...|$|R
40|$|The lipids in {{feedstuffs}} commonly {{consumed by}} swine consist mainly of neutral fats, specifically triglycerides. The concentration of fats in feedstuffs varies widely. Fat levels range from 1. 5 to 4. 5 % among cereal grains, 4. 5 to 10 % among high oil corn lines,. 5 to 9 % in fibrous byproducts,. 5 to 20 % in common protein feedstuffs, and 90 to 99 % in supplemental fat sources. Consequently, {{the level of}} fat in a particular diet {{is dependent on the}} type of basic feedstuffs included as well as the level of a supplemental fat source. For example, corn (standard yellow dent) and wheat contain about 3. 9 and 1. 7 % fat, respectively. Inclusion of wheat for corn in a simple corn-soybean meal mix effectively lowers the fat content of the diet by one-half. Similarly, the replacement of half of the dehulled soybean meal (. 8 % fat) with full-fat beans (18 % fat) as the supplemental protein source in a corn-soy mix raises the dietary fat content from 3 to above 5 %. Supplemental fat sources commonly used in swine diets include animal fats (tallows, greases), vegetable oils (corn, soybeans), restaurant greases (spent oils and greases), and commercial blends (mixtures of vegetable oil, animal fats, restaurant <b>grease).</b> The <b>composition</b> of these fats largely differ in the type of fatty acids, the building blocks of fat, that are present. Animal fats normally contain more saturated fatty acids which are a solid at roo...|$|R
40|$|Fats, oil and <b>grease,</b> {{the main}} <b>composition</b> of GTW, {{is the major}} cause of sewer pipe {{blockage}} {{that can lead to}} a costly treatment for councils as well as the households themselves. To prevent this, grease traps are required to be installed in most of commercial food services such as restaurants and food processing factories. As a result, a large amount of grease trap waste is being collected and need to be treated {{at the end of life}} that can cause many problems for most of the environmental services. This study investigated a potential solvent extraction method to extract FOG from the very low quality GTW. GTW was collected from an environmental service in Adelaide region, while hexane (HEX), diethyl ether (DEE) and co-solvent hexane - diethyl ether (HEX-DEE) are utilised as solvent to extract FOG and used it as a feedstock for biodiesel production. The results showed that the extraction yield was increased significantly while utilising the solvent as the following order: DEE > HEX-DEE > HEX. A 96 % extraction yield was obtained under the optimum operating condition of 1 : 1 DEE-GTW ratio (v/w), 30 oC, 300 rpm and 360 min. In addition, HEX-DEE co-solvent was observed more efficiency in terms of emulsion reduction. All of the solvents are recycled and can be used two to three times for FOG extraction with more than 88 % extraction yield.

40|$|Associating {{the global}} trend of {{incorporating}} active compounds and plants in cosmetic formulations {{and the vast}} Brazilian biodiversity, the present work aimed to study the incorporation of Brazilian vegetable oils in hair conditioner formulations, evaluating the mechanical resistance of hair fibers. The following oils were incorporated into base formulations at 5. 0 % (w/w) : babassu, buriti, andiroba and pequi. The formulations were applied to samples of Caucasian hair, followed by several washing steps, then the evaluation of mechanical strength. It was {{found that there was}} no statistically significant difference in mechanical resistance between samples treated with oils and the control between the first and seventh wash cycles. This fact {{can be explained by the}} possible low penetration of oils into the cortex, a region responsible for the mechanical properties of the hair fiber, since the <b>grease</b> <b>composition</b> disfavors its diffusion. The common effects of vegetable oils on the cuticle, such as filling in cracks or cavities, lubrication, and increased protein hydrophobicity cannot be excluded. The oils tested in this work were not able to raise or protect hair tresses. However, additional studies are required in order to establish the effects of oil treatments, particularly in damaged hair...|$|E
40|$|The {{microstructure}} of {{lubricating greases}} greatly conditions their in-service performance. In that sense, optimal testing protocols are required {{in order to}} accomplish their correct morphological characterization. This study explores and compares the suitability of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques for imaging six different commercial metallic soap-based greases and two novel biopolymer-based formulations. Pros and cons of both techniques and the effect of sample preparation protocol were analysed. The results revealed a wide variety of morphological characteristics depending on composition. Thus, the four anhydrous calcium-based greases demonstrated two clearly distinct microstructures (fibrous and granular) determined by the type of base oil employed. With regard to the lithium complex greases, the typically reported microstructure characterized by well-defined entangled and fibrous network was observed in both AFM and SEM techniques. As for the two biopolymer-based greases, fibre networks were also encountered. Besides this, selected greases were subjected to different tribological tests, and the effect of high-shear frictional working treatments on their microstructure was also analysed. As a result of the friction and internal wear, the AFM results evidenced microstructural changes which depended on <b>grease</b> <b>composition.</b> Overall, the combined use of AFM and SEM techniques was demonstrated to be a powerful approach to microstructurally characterize lubricating greases. This work is part of two research projects (CTQ 2014 - 56038 -C 3 - 1 R and TEP- 1499) sponsored by MINECO-FEDER and Junta de Andalucia programmes, respectively.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} film {{formation}} and friction in grease lubricated, rolling-sliding, non-conformal contacts over {{a range of}} entrainment speeds, surface roughnesses and contact temperatures. The effects of <b>grease</b> <b>composition</b> are assessed by employing custom made, additive free, lithium and diurea thickened greases, whose composition is systematically varied so {{that the effects of}} the thickener and the base oil can be isolated. All film thickness and friction measurements were conducted under fully-flooded conditions. It was found that at low speeds all tested greases are able to form thicker films than the corresponding base oils. The thickness and behaviour of these films is determined by the thickener type and is independent of the base oil viscosity and the test temperature. At higher speeds, the film thickness is governed by the base oil properties alone and can be predicted by the EHD theory. At low speeds, films with diurea greases grow with time under constant speed and residual films persist under load after contact motion ceases. The real lambda ratio, based on measured grease film thickness, was shown to correlate well with contact friction. The transition from the thickener dominated behaviour to that dominated by the base oil occurs at a relatively constant film thickness, regardless of the base oil viscosity and test temperatures, rather than at a given entrainment speed. Based on the presented evidence, it is here proposed that the mechanism of formation of grease films at low speeds, is analogous to that reported to operate in EHL contacts lubricated with colloidal dispersions, namely the mechanical entrapment and deposition of thickener fibres, and that, rather than the widely quoted ???transition speed???, it is the ratio of the thickener fibre size to prevailing film thickness that determines the range of conditions under which the film enhancement due to the action of thickener is present...|$|E
