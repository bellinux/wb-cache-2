5|$|Alan Tudyk <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> for {{an episode}} about a planet {{that is always}} day on one side, and night on the other. On the night side, Jayne accidentally spills a type of {{pheromone}} on himself and the crew, which attracts a species of dogs. The crew are chased {{back to the ship}} by these dogs. There River uses her mind powers to domesticate the dogs.|$|E

Naveen Andrews, who played the character Sayid on the show, <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of encouraging the writers to write a romantic relationship between his character and Shannon into the story. Critics found {{her to be a}} largely unsympathetic character until only shortly before her death. Nonetheless, Grace received a Teen Choice Award nomination for her role as Shannon.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Hillenburg {{first became}} {{fascinated with the}} ocean and began {{developing}} his artistic abilities as a child. During college, he majored in marine biology and minored in art. After graduating in 1984, he joined the Ocean Institute, an ocean education organization, where he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> to create a comic book titled The Intertidal Zone, {{which led to the}} creation of SpongeBob SquarePants. In 1987, Hillenburg left the Institute to pursue a career in animation.|$|E
5000|$|Although I <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of {{substance}} in me {{by virtue of}} being a substance, this does not account for my <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of an infinite substance, when I am finite. This idea must have come from some substance which really was infinite.|$|R
5000|$|I cannot <b>have</b> gained <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>the</b> {{infinite}} {{merely by}} negating the finite. On the contrary, {{to know that}} I am finite means knowing that I lack something and so must first <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>the</b> infinite to make that comparison.|$|R

5|$|After the {{discovery}} of the short pulsed electric arc in 1800 by Humphry Davy and of the continuous electric arc in 1802 by Vasily Petrov, arc welding developed slowly. C. L. Coffin <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of welding in an inert gas atmosphere in 1890, but even in the early 20th century, welding non-ferrous materials such as aluminum and magnesium remained difficult because these metals react rapidly with the air and result in porous, dross-filled welds. Processes using flux-covered electrodes did not satisfactorily protect the weld area from contamination. To solve the problem, bottled inert gases were used {{in the beginning of the}} 1930s. A few years later, a direct current, gas-shielded welding process emerged in the aircraft industry for welding magnesium.|$|E
5|$|Jeffrey Tayor of Stagescreen Productions <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of {{a modern}} version of Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde in the mid-1990s. He {{attempted}} to get it produced in the United States three times, but all three attempts fell through for various reasons. He returned to England from {{the west coast of}} the United States and joined with Hartswood Films when Elaine Cameron was scouting for ideas for a supernatural thriller. Cameron then approached Steven Moffat for a script, and a six-part series was commissioned by the BBC's Jane Tranter and John Yorke in November 2005.|$|E
5|$|She then <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> {{to weave}} some of it, so she kept some for herself. Having {{observed}} {{the life of}} the silk worm on the recommendation of her husband, the Yellow Emperor, she began to instruct her entourage in the art of raising silk worms, sericulture. From this point, the girl became the goddess of silk in Chinese mythology. Silk eventually left China via the heir of a princess who was promised to a prince of Khotan. This probably occurred in the early 1st century CE. The princess, refusing to go without the fabric that she loved, would finally break the imperial ban on silk-worm exportation.|$|E

5|$|Stephen Hillenburg {{first became}} {{fascinated with the}} ocean and began {{developing}} his artistic abilities as a child. During college, he majored in marine biology and minored in art. He planned to return to college eventually to pursue a master's degree in art. After graduating in 1984, he joined the Ocean Institute, an organization dedicated to educating the public about marine science and maritime history. While he was there, he initially <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> {{that would lead to}} the creation of SpongeBob SquarePants: a comic book titled The Intertidal Zone. In 1987, Hillenburg left the institute to pursue a career in animation.|$|E
5|$|The first {{continental}} competition organised by CONMEBOL, {{the governing}} body of football in South America, was the 1960 Copa Libertadores. Before this official tournament, Chilean club Colo-Colo's President Robinson Alvarez <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> for a South American Championship of Champions, which was eventually held in Santiago in 1948. In 1958, the new CONMEBOL president, José Ramos de Freitas, contacted South American football associations intending to introduce an annual competition for clubs on the continent. The following year, at a CONMEBOL congress in Caracas, {{the creation of}} a South American Champions Cup was decided, renamed as Copa Libertadores in honour of the heroes of South American liberation.|$|E
5|$|The video, {{which cost}} Jackson $150,000 to create after CBS refused to finance it, was filmed on Los Angeles' Skid Row—mainly on {{locations}} on East 5th Street—around March 9, 1983. To add authenticity {{to the production}} but also to foster peace between them, Jackson <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> to cast members of rival Los Angeles street gangs Crips and Bloods. In addition to around 80 genuine gang members, the video, which is noted for opening up many job opportunities for dancers in the US, also featured 18 professional dancers and four breakdancers. Besides Jackson, Michael Peters, and Vincent Paterson, the cast included Michael DeLorenzo, Stoney Jackson, Tracii Guns, Tony Fields, Peter Tramm, Rick Stone, and Cheryl Song.|$|E

5|$|When Itachi {{is first}} {{mentioned}} by Sasuke in the manga, Kishimoto had not planned about the character's backstory. The only idea {{he had was}} to attribute to Itachi some violent action that would have Sasuke wanting to kill him. However, when Itachi was introduced, Kishimoto <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> to make Itachi Konoha's secret agent who killed his clans under their orders. Itachi was originally conceived {{as the leader of}} Konoha's Special Assassination and Tactical Squad, dubbed the , which would have been a 70-man group divided into four teams, specialising in assassination and other illicit operations. However, this idea was scrapped in favor of the current Itachi working for Akatsuki. From all the Akatsuki characters Kishimoto designed, Itachi is his favorite based on his backstory.|$|E
5|$|Curtis, {{inspired}} {{by the fact that}} Van Gogh never knew he would be famous, <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> for an episode centred on him. He left the script open to criticism from the crew and made many revisions as a result. Curtis wanted to portray Van Gogh truthfully, rather than being cruel by writing jokes about his mental illness. Most of the episode was filmed in Trogir, Croatia, and many of the sets were modelled after Van Gogh paintings. The episode was watched by 6.76 million viewers on BBC One and BBC HD. Reception to the episode varied, ranging from very positive to mixed to very negative. While the amount of emotion in the episode was debated, many reviewers agreed that Curran's performance as Van Gogh was excellent, but that the Krafayis was not a threatening monster.|$|E
5|$|Despite these successes, Parsons, {{the project}} {{engineer}} of Aerojet's Solid Fuel Department, remained motivated {{to address the}} malfunctions observed during the Ercoupe tests. In June 1942, assisted by Mills and Miller, he focused his attention on developing an effective method of restricted burning when using solid rocket fuel, as the military demanded JATOs that could provide over 100 pounds of thrust without any risk of exploding. Although solid fuels such as GALCIT-27 were more storable than their liquid counterparts, they were disfavored for military JATO use as they provided less immediate thrust {{and did not have}} the versatility of being turned on and off mid-flight. Parsons tried to resolve GALCIT-27's stability issue with GALCIT-46, which replaced the former's ammonium nitrate with guanidine nitrate. To avoid the problems seen with ammonium nitrate, he had GALCIT-46 cooled and then heated prior to testing. When it failed the test, he realized that the fuel's binding black powders rather than the oxidizers had resulted in their instability, and in June that year <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of using liquid asphalt as an appropriate binding agent with potassium perchlorate as oxidizer.|$|E

5|$|Development on Gotcha {{began in}} July 1973, as Atari's fourth game after Pong, Space Race, and Pong Doubles. The company was {{interested}} in producing a very different game from their previous success of Pong, as they felt that innovative design was what would separate them from their competitors, which they saw as flooding the market with Pong clones rather than making new video games. After the release of Space Race, development immediately moved on to Gotcha. The design of the game was done by Allan Alcorn, the designer of Pong and developer for Space Race. Alcorn <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> for the game from a defect he sometimes saw when testing Pong machines: if part of the circuit that converted scores to images on the screens was broken, then parts of the numbers would be scattered across the screen. Alcorn thought that combining that defect intentionally with a motion circuit could create dynamically changing mazes. A prototype design was developed by Steve Mayer of Cyan Engineering, which had recently become a semi-independent research and development subsidiary of Atari.|$|E
5|$|Fermi <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> {{to resort}} to {{replacing}} the polonium-beryllium neutron source with a radon-beryllium one, which he created by filling a glass bulb with beryllium powder, evacuating the air, and then adding 50 mCi of radon gas, supplied by Giulio Cesare Trabacchi. This created a much stronger neutron source, the effectiveness of which declined with the 3.8-day half-life of radon. He knew that this source would also emit gamma rays, but, {{on the basis of}} his theory, he believed that this would not affect the results of the experiment. He started by bombarding platinum, an element with a high atomic number that was readily available, without success. He turned to aluminium, which emitted an alpha particle and produced sodium, which then decayed into magnesium by beta particle emission. He tried lead, without success, and then fluorine in the form of calcium fluoride, which emitted an alpha particle and produced nitrogen, decaying into oxygen by beta particle emission. In all, he induced radioactivity in 22 different elements. Fermi rapidly reported the discovery of neutron-induced radioactivity in the Italian journal La Ricerca Scientifica on 25 March 1934.|$|E
5|$|In March 1995, American Tejano music singer Selena {{was shot}} and killed by Yolanda Saldívar, her friend and former manager of the singer's boutiques. The impact of the singer's death had a {{negative}} impact on Latin music, her genre—which she catapulted it into the mainstream market—suffered and its popularity waned following Selena's death. She continued to be the last remaining Tejano recording artist to appear on the United States Billboard 200 chart since 2000. In the fall of 2011, Chilean record producer Humberto Gatica and Capitol Latin senior vice president Sergio Lopes <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of turning Selena's songs into duets in popular music genres. Mexican singers Cristian Castro, Samo, American singers Don Omar, Carlos Santana, Selena Gomez (who was named after Selena), and Spanish singer Juan Magan lent their voices for the duet/remix style album. The project—named Enamorada de Ti—was released in April 2012 and debuted and peaked at number one on the U.S. Top Latin Albums and Latin Pop Albums chart. Lo Mejor de...Selena followed the commercial success of Enamorada de Ti, released on the twentieth anniversary of Selena's death. It was also made available for digital download and released as a double disc.|$|E
50|$|Joey and Stranahan soon {{develop a}} sexual {{relationship}} and continue to plan more intricate and sophisticated acts of revenge. Stranahan <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of pretending to blackmail Chaz, by inventing a witness to Joey’s murder.|$|R
5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{beliefs of}} the Amungme people are animistic. The Amungme people did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of [...] "gods" [...] that are separate from nature where spirits and nature {{are one and the}} same.|$|R

5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} by Takeshi Yamazaki and produced by Motohide Eshiro. Eshiro {{had come up with}} the idea of a new adventure game about Ace Attorney characters while working on Trials and Tribulations, and Yamazaki <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> to have it be about deductive reasoning and crime scene investigation. The game was specifically designed to be different from previous Ace Attorney titles, with a larger focus on the environment. The development team had originally considered using Ema Skye, a character from earlier games in the series, as the lead character, but used Miles Edgeworth instead because of his popularity. They aimed to have players be immersed in the game and feel like they are Edgeworth, as opposed to previous Ace Attorney games, where they felt players merely could identify with the lead characters; to do this, they included direct control of Edgeworth, and a gameplay element that involves connecting his thoughts.|$|E
5|$|Writer Darin Morgan had {{pieces of}} the script for a long time, drawing {{inspiration}} from research he had done on hypnosis and a book on government coverups and UFOs that theorized that UFOs are a phenomenon that manipulate space and time, but are not piloted by aliens. Morgan <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> for the teaser in mind before becoming a staff member on the show. The narrative style was influenced by a casting session Morgan witnessed where an actor auditioning sounded like Truman Capote. From this {{he came up with}} the idea to have a writer covering the case. Capote died in 1984, and second choice Rip Taylor was unavailable, so the role of Jose Chung ended up going to Charles Nelson Reilly. Jesse Ventura was cast as one of the men in black, while the other, which Morgan had originally wanted Johnny Cash for, went to Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek. The role of Lord Kinbote went to stuntman Tony Morelli.|$|E
5|$|Mills booked {{herself into}} the Hippocrates Health Institute in Florida, which put her on a raw food vegan diet, using wheat grass and garlic poultices to heal her wound. After an operation, Mills {{discovered}} {{that she had been}} previously identified as having an O rhesus negative blood type, when in fact she was A rhesus negative, which had interfered with her attempts to follow the so-called blood type diet. As her prosthetic leg had to be replaced on a regular basis, because the size of the amputated stump kept changing as it healed, she <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> to collect thousands of discarded prosthetic limbs for amputees in Croatia. Mills persuaded the Brixton prison governor to get inmates to dismantle and pack the prosthetic limbs before being transported, which resulted in 22,000 amputees obtaining limbs in addition to the Croatian citizens who were already supplied with prosthetic limbs by the Croatian Institute for Health Insurance, which paid for the fitting of limbs and rehabilitation of patients. The first convoy of limbs arrived in Zagreb in October 1994 and Mills travelled with the convoy to film interviews with some of the recipients for the Good Morning with Anne and Nick daytime TV show. She received an award in 2001 from Croatia's prime minister, Ivica Račan for the money she raised to help clear that country of landmines.|$|E
