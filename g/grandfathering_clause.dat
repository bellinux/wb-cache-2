40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} the New Source Review (NSR) environmental regulations on coal-fired electric power plants. The New Source Review program, which grew out of the Clean Air Act of 1970, required new plants to install costly pollution control equipment but exempt existing plants with a <b>grandfathering</b> <b>clause.</b> Previous theoretical research has shown that vintage differentiated regulations, like NSR, can lead to distortions, and if the distortions are large, the short run effect of a regulation like NSR may be to increase pollution rather than reduce it. Older, dirtier plants may be kept in service longer or run more intensively since replacing them becomes more expensive. In the case of NSR, there is also an effect associated with its enforcement. Since upgrading a plant could potentially qualify it as a new plant, the old plants may have done less maintenance leading to lower efficiency and higher emissions. This paper attempts to estimate {{the extent to which these}} mechanisms have impacted coal-fired electric power plants. We find suggestive evidence that NSR increased operating lifetimes of plants in areas where environmental regulations were most stringent. We also find evidence that the risk of NSR enforcement reduced capital expenditures at plants. However, we find no discernable effect on the operating costs or fuel efficiency of these plants...|$|E

40|$|WTO Members {{have more}} leeway under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) to elude the WTO's basic most favoured nation (MFN) {{obligation}} than in merchandise trade under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In particular, under the Annex on Article II Exemptions, each Member had the one-off opportunity [...] at the GATS' {{entry into force}} in 1995 or, if later, the date of WTO accession [...] to seek cover for the retention of whatever departures from MFN treatment. Such MFN exemptions are subject to relatively soft disciplines only. The relevant Annex provides that their duration should not exceed 10 years in principle, and that they be subject to negotiation in any subsequent trade round. In addition, the GATS allows for departures from MFN treatment, which {{are not subject to}} time constraints, including for Economic Integration Agreements and recognition measures related to standards, certificates and the like. Over 90 WTO Members (counting EC 12 as one) have listed MFN exemptions for close to 500 measures in total. This article discusses their role within the structure of the GATS as well as governments' underlying policy intentions: <b>grandfathering</b> <b>clause</b> or active/offensive policy tool? It further traces the sectoral and modal patterns of current exemptions, their use by different groups of Members and the [...] limited [...] changes offered in the services negotiations to date. The authors submit that the non-availability of new exemptions, including for measures that had escaped Members' attention at the relevant point in time, could have added to the popularity of potential substitutes (including in the context of Economic Integration Agreements), promoted an excessively broad interpretation of existing exemptions and discouraged governments from rescinding those that had served their initial purpose. A more flexible approach might thus be warranted; possible options are being discussed. Oxford University Press 2009, all rights reserved, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E
40|$|A 2001 US Supreme Court {{decision}} {{limiting the}} scope of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act by eliminating federal authority over isolated wetlands has shifted the burden for regulating wetlands to states and local governments. Given New York State’s current wetland regulations, {{the gap in the}} federal wetland regulations can not be filled at the state level. This study centered {{on the question of whether}} local wetland protection ordinances can fill this regulatory gap. Local wetland protection laws in the Hudson Valley were surveyed to provide insight into how many municipalities have local wetland protection ordinances, and to provide data as to the level of wetland protection. Of the 240 towns and villages located in the 10 counties in the Hudson Valley, only 30 percent have local wetland protection laws. Most of these municipalities also regulate buffers around wetlands and watercourses. Almost half of the municipalities with ordinances regulate wetland areas down to no minimum size threshold which includes isolated wetlands, which therefore exceeds federal wetland regulations and fills this regulatory gap. The study also included an analysis of municipalities that recently have passed, failed or is currently pursuing wetland protection ordinances to determine what challenges and issues were faced and what elements of the law required compromising. Officials agreed getting the public involved early in the procedures was the most important issue. Political alignment was proved to determine the likelihood of a municipality to have such ordinances. Municipalities that failed to implement wetland protection regulations appeared to result from misinformation or a lack of information provided to the public. The most controversial element of these regulations is the buffer areas. Most towns had to compromise on the buffer areas. A <b>grandfathering</b> <b>clause</b> was also significant in getting the public to endorse the new regulations. Typically, activities surrounding residential and agricultural properties were important issues. Several recently passed wetland and watercourse regulations were the result of public concern for health and safety issues such as flooding events...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the current legal regime applicable to animal-human combinations under the Assisted Human Reproduction Act (Canada). The Act prohibits as criminal offences the use of non-human reproductive material in humans, the use in humans of human reproductive material previously transplanted into a non-human life form, the creation of chimeras made from human embryos, and the creation for reproductive purposes of human/non-human hybrids. Additional animal-human combinations, such as transgenic life forms, may be regulated pursuant to section 11 of the Act in the future. The underlying concerns of the Act in establishing this regime {{appear to be the}} protection of human health and safety, human dignity and individuality, and the human genome. The Act seems calibrated to prohibit the creation of animal-human combinations that are currently unsafe and scientifically and ethically problematic, while leaving open the possibility of regulating other such combinations with more immediate scientific potential, although these also raise ethical questions. Currently, certain differences subsist in Canada between what is permissible for researchers and institutions funded by federal agencies and those in privately funded research. The development of the regulatory framework under the Act will reveal how freedom of research will be balanced against the need for scientifically valid and ethically justifiable research, and whether these differences will continue to apply.
