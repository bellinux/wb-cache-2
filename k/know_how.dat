5|$|Abebe {{returned}} to his homeland a hero. He was greeted by a large crowd, many dignitaries and {{the commander of the}} Imperial Guard, Brigadier-General Mengistu Neway. Abebe was paraded through the streets of Addis Ababa along a procession route lined with thousands of people and presented to Emperor Haile Selassie. The emperor awarded him the Star of Ethiopia and promoted him to the rank of asiraleqa (corporal). He was given the use of a chauffeur-driven Volkswagen Beetle (since he did not yet <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to drive) and a home, both owned by the Guard.|$|E

5|$|After {{his release}} from prison in 2010, Chen was placed under house arrest against Chinese law, and was closely {{monitored}} by security forces. Legally, he was proclaimed {{by the government to}} be a free man, but in reality the local government offered no explanation for the hundreds of unidentified agents monitoring his house and preventing visitors or escape. The national propaganda organ, the Global Times, expressed confusion over the issue, and suggested that the local government may not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to handle it, but no disciplinary action was taken at the national level.|$|E
5|$|During Rædwald's youth, the {{establishment}} of other ruling houses was accomplished. Sometime before 588, Æthelberht of Kent married Bercta, the Christian daughter of the Frankish ruler Charibert. As early as 568, Ceawlin of Wessex, the most powerful ruler south of the River Humber, repulsed Æthelberht. According to later sources, Mercia was founded by Creoda in 585, although a paucity of sources {{makes it difficult to}} <b>know</b> <b>how</b> the Mercian royal line became established.|$|E
5|$|Gilsig has {{characterized}} Terri as being emotionally {{still in high}} school, and lacking the skills to make her marriage work. She has explained that Terri feels threatened by her husband's commitment to the glee club, worried that it is pulling him away from her, and will stop at nothing to keep her marriage together. She does not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> long Terri will be featured in the series, as she was initially created simply {{as an obstacle to}} come between Will and Emma.|$|E

5|$|Just {{before the}} capture of Jerusalem, the British War Office had been very worried about Allenby's {{extended}} advance and warned of a possible retirement back to Gaza and Beersheba if the war on the Western Front dictated the transfer {{of large numbers of}} troops from the Levant.

The War Office then wanted to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> Allenby might exploit his success {{with the addition of a}} division from Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|Meg asks Lois and Peter if she {{can have}} a {{birthday}} party, preferably a teenager-type party with a band playing at her house. Unfortunately, Peter and Lois don't even <b>know</b> <b>how</b> old Meg is going to be.

Meg notices that her birthday party is kiddie-type, with games such as Pin the Tail on the Donkey.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns {{demands for}} Maggie to be arrested, {{but he is}} {{dismissed}} by Wiggum, who says no jury would convict a baby for a crime. Marge also adds the shooting {{must have been an}} accident, considering Maggie, being an infant, is very unlikely to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to operate a gun. In the final shot, Maggie is shown with shifty eyes, suggesting that she may have shot Mr. Burns deliberately.|$|E

5|$|Ochs went on tour {{wearing the}} gold suit, {{backed by a}} rock band, singing his own {{material}} along with medleys of songs by Buddy Holly, Elvis, and Merle Haggard. His fans did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to respond. This new Phil Ochs drew a hostile reaction from his audience. Ochs's March 27, 1970, concerts at Carnegie Hall were the most successful, {{and by the end}} of that night's second show Ochs had won over many in the crowd. The show was recorded and released as Gunfight at Carnegie Hall.|$|E
5|$|Romney {{opposed the}} use of {{mandatory}} limits on greenhouse gas emissions to deal with global warming. He stated that he believed climate change is occurring, but {{that he did not}} <b>know</b> <b>how</b> much of it could be linked to human activity. He was a proponent of increased domestic oil drilling, hydraulic fracturing ("fracking"), building more nuclear power plants, and reducing the regulatory authority of the Environmental Protection Agency. He believed North American energy independence could be achieved by 2020.|$|E

5|$|The defence {{argued that}} Sheila was the killer, {{and that she}} did <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to handle guns, {{because she had been}} raised on a farm and had {{attended}} shoots when she was younger. She had a very serious mental illness, had told a psychiatrist she felt capable of killing her children, and the loaded rifle and cartridges had been left on the kitchen table by Bamber. There had been a recent family argument about placing the children in foster care.|$|E
5|$|The field {{grew from}} 19th century beginnings, where {{embryology}} faced a mystery: zoologists did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> embryonic development was controlled {{at the molecular}} level. Charles Darwin noted that having similar embryos implied common ancestry, but little progress was made until the 1970s. Then, recombinant DNA technology at last brought embryology together with molecular genetics. A key early discovery was of homeotic genes that regulate development {{in a wide range}} of eukaryotes.|$|E

In a post-credits scene, Aramov approaches a mysterious man inside the Agency headquarters and whispers something in his ear. He congratulates her while the camera pulls back to show PharCom boxes in the office.|$|E
