5|$|Lines {{of poems}} are often {{organized}} into stanzas, which are denominated {{by the number}} of lines included. Thus a collection of two lines is a couplet (or distich), three lines a triplet (or tercet), four lines a quatrain, and so on. These lines may or may not relate to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>by</b> rhyme or rhythm. For example, a couplet may be two lines with identical meters which rhyme or two lines held together by a common meter alone.|$|E

5|$|Not {{only are}} groups useful {{to assess the}} {{implications}} of symmetries in molecules, but surprisingly they also predict that molecules sometimes can change symmetry.
