In 2005, EU customs seized more than 75 million counterfeited goods, including foods, medicines and other goods, partly due to internet sales.

40|$|Before {{to start}} writing this {{contribute}} {{on the use}} of “heavy elements isotope ratio” for food traceability purposes, let us to underline our though about this nowadays important topic. In fact, it is fairly common to closely link the use of isotope ratios parameters, either of light or bio elements and heavy ones, as tools against <b>food</b> <b>counterfeiting.</b> Furthermore, it is worth to highlight how these indicators tackled rather successfully this task. Nevertheless, another important aspect, largely lacking (or neglected), needs to be considered. Indeed, geographical traceability of food should be considered as an opportunity to increase food quality. The objective possibility to link the food to its production territory (its “terroir”) represents an opportunity of growth for both the producers and the consumers...|$|E

With a growing threat of <b>food</b> adulteration and <b>counterfeiting,</b> a need for quality authentication is essential to protect the integrity and strong market value of Philippine civet coffee. At present, there is no internationally accepted method of verifying whether a bean is an authentic civet coffee.

40|$|Food {{fraud is}} related to {{different}} illicit conducts which aim at gaining economic benefit from <b>counterfeiting</b> <b>food</b> and ignoring the damage they cause to public economy and health. Consumers use the new technologies, like social networks, in order to share their worries about food frauds and to stay informed about them. But, in such a complex and dynamic context, {{it is important to}} ensure the reliability of news about food frauds in order to avoid misinformation and general panic phenomena. In this context, we propose an extension of a Collective Knowledge System aiming at verifying the reliability of news about food frauds and to decide whether to publish and spread information on the food frauds in the society. A Fuzzy Consensus Model has been proposed for helping the experts in achieving a shared decision about the reliability of each news and about its publication and diffusion.

However, officials worried that protectionist forces in the US could use the spate of quality problems to restrict trade. As Zheng was being executed, representatives of the country's leading food and drug regulatory bodies were holding a joint news conference to emphasize their determination to crack down on fake and <b>counterfeit</b> <b>food</b> and medicine. After weeks of denying serious problems or accusing foreign forces of exaggerating the issue, officials have begun to strike a less defensive tone.

40|$|Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) {{combines}} spectroscopy with imaging, {{enabling the}} identification of the chemical signature of scene materials and objects without physical contact. The potential of HSI is enormous. Although originally applied in the professional market of remote sensing, researchers are striving to develop low-cost, miniaturized and high-speed hyperspectral cameras for low-cost consumer applications such as <b>food</b> inspection, <b>counterfeit</b> detection, etc. in various, portable form factors. Hyperspectral data is collected in a 3 D hyperspectral image cube/data structure with two spatial (horizontal) and one spectral (vertical) dimension. The process of stacking spectral images acquired from a 2 D hyperspectral camera to form a 3 D hyperspectral image cube, generally suffers from misalignment/misregistration, preventing the accurate reading of the scenes chemical-spectral signatures. To achieve a perfect hyperspectral cube, images have to be aligned with sub-pixel accuracy. The main objective of the thesis herein is two-fold. First, we develop a robust registration algorithm, immune against the severe hyperspectral image artifacts such as blur, noise and spectral reflectance variations. To meet this research objective, this thesis proposes two novel feature detection algorithms using the cosine modulated Gaussian and the tenth order Gaussian derivative filters. The proposed feature detection algorithms show a two times higher immunity against the image artifacts as compared to state-of-the-art methods. These feature detection algorithms also double the registration accuracy. Second, we also propose a low complexity implementation approach. The thesis proposes a fixed-length approximation filter, providing constant-time, low-cost image filtering implementations. Finally, uniquely combining the proposed advanced feature detection algorithms with RANdom SAmple Consensus's (RANSAC) model parameter estimation, the proposed registration algorithm reduces the registration error from hundreds of pixels in the raw hyperspectral image cube down to half-pixel registration inaccuracy, without the need of costly calibration, deblurring and/or denoising techniques in hardware or software. This eventually paves the way to a low-cost, yet reliable hardware/software co-designed hyperspectral imaging system. nrpages: 276 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Terrestrial {{remote sensing}} imagery {{involves}} {{the acquisition of}} information from the Earth's surface without physical contact with the area under study. Among the remote sensing modalities, hyperspectral imaging has recently emerged as a powerful passive technology. This technology has been widely used {{in the fields of}} urban and regional planning, water resource management, environmental monitoring, <b>food</b> safety, <b>counterfeit</b> drugs detection, oil spill and other types of chemical contamination detection, biological hazards prevention, and target detection for military and security purposes [2 - 9]. Hyperspectral sensors sample the reflected solar radiation from the Earth surface in the portion of the spectrum extending from the visible region through the near-infrared and mid-infrared (wavelengths between 0. 3 and 2. 5 µm) in hundreds of narrow (of the order of 10 nm) contiguous bands [10]. This high spectral resolution can be used for object detection and for discriminating between different objects based on their spectral xharacteristics [6]. However, this huge spectral resolution yields large amounts of data to be processed. For example, the Airbone Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) [11] collects a 512 (along track) X 614 (across track) X 224 (bands) X 12 (bits) data cube in 5 s, corresponding to about 140 MBs. Similar data collection ratios are achieved by other spectrometers [12]. Such huge data volumes put stringent requirements on communications, storage, and processing. The problem of signal sbspace identification of hyperspectral data represents a crucial first step in many hypersctral processing algorithms such as target detection, change detection, classification, and unmixing. The identification of this subspace enables a correct dimensionality reduction (DR) yelding gains in data storage and retrieval and in computational time and complexity. Additionally, DR may also improve algorithms performance since it reduce data dimensionality without losses in the useful signal components. The computation of statistical estimates is a relevant example of the advantages of DR, since the number of samples required to obtain accurate estimates increases drastically with the dimmensionality of the data (Hughes phnomenon) [13]...|$|R

Problems that are getting special attention especially the concern of contamination of food products by non-halal meat. For example rat meat on meatballs. This research {{is expected to be}} one of the basis for the guarantee of non-halal meatballs products. The study of Fourier Transform Infrared spectrophotometry (FTIR) combined with chemometrics can be used to identify the presence of rat meat in meatballs qualitatively and quantitatively. Samples of meatballs are made by preparing pure rat and pure beef meat. The calibration samples were prepared by making meatballs containing beef - rat with variations of 0 %, 25 %, 35 %, 65 %, 75 %, and 100 % rat meat in dough meatballs. Validation samples were prepared from a number of meatballs prepared in the laboratory containing rat meat in a certain concentration and 5 samples of meatballs in the market.
