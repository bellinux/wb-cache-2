'Not this, not this,' he whimpered to himself, as {{the first}} perfect mood of {{softness}} and sleep-loveliness ebbed {{back away from the}} rushing of passion that came up to his limbs and over his face as she drew him. And soon he was a perfect <b>hard</b> <b>flame</b> of passionate desire for her. Yet in the small core of the flame was an unyielding anguish of another thing. But this also was lost; he only wanted her, with an extreme desire that seemed inevitable as death, beyond question.|$|E
50|$|Tsuna {{received}} an upgrade from the metal craftsman Talbot. This {{gave him the}} Ring of The Vongola Ver. 10. This new form allows him to access higher level of flame output and increases {{the power of the}} original x burner with the attack having a 'face' which is similar to Natsu's in appearance. This attack is so powerful that it was able to destroy the black hole that Emna was trapped in. Another technique is the XX Burner. It is a modified X Burner, being twice as powerful since in this technique, both gloves shoot <b>hard</b> <b>flames,</b> while arm thrusters shoot soft flames that act as support.|$|R

60|$|Mr Doyce stood, chamber-candlestick in hand, {{the other}} hand in his pocket, looking <b>hard</b> at the <b>flame</b> of his candle, with a certain quiet {{perception}} in his face {{that they were going}} to say something more. 'I thought our good friend a little changed, and out of spirits, after he came this morning?' said Clennam.|$|R
60|$|I {{wonder you}} can bear it. I think of Fleet Street and Lincoln's Inn {{now with a}} shudder of disgust. There are only two {{things in the world}} that make life worth living, love and art. I cannot imagine you sitting in an office over a ledger, and do you wear a tall hat and an {{umbrella}} and a little black bag? My feeling is that one should look upon life as an adventure, one should burn with the <b>hard,</b> gem-like <b>flame,</b> and one should take risks, one should expose oneself to danger. Why do you not go to Paris and study art? I always thought you had talent.|$|R
60|$|Pater's {{mistake is}} {{revealed}} in his most famous phrase. He asks us to burn with a <b>hard,</b> gem-like <b>flame.</b> <b>Flames</b> are never <b>hard</b> and never gem-like--they cannot be handled or arranged. So human emotions are never hard and never gem-like; they are always dangerous, like flames, to touch or even to examine. There {{is only one way}} in which our passions can become hard and gem-like, and that is by becoming as cold as gems. No blow then has ever been struck at the natural loves and laughter of men so sterilizing as this carpe diem of the aesthetes. For any kind of pleasure a totally different spirit is required; a certain shyness, a certain indeterminate hope, a certain boyish expectation. Purity and simplicity are essential to passions--yes even to evil passions. Even vice demands a sort of virginity.|$|R
50|$|Menaced by bushfires in 1928, {{settlers}} had {{to battle}} <b>hard</b> against the <b>flames</b> {{in order to}} save their properties. More bushfires, fanned by strong winds, swept across the region in 1935 burning out over 100 ha and destroying one house and a barn. More bushfires were burning in the district {{over the course of several}} days in 1937 resulting in the stables and the sheds at the local race course to be burned down, the destruction of large amounts of feed for stock and the loss of telephone lines.|$|R
60|$|When she limped {{out into}} the kitchen, Judith looked up with a <b>hard</b> face. A <b>flame</b> of sullen anger glowed in her dark eyes, and {{she went into the}} sitting-room and shut the door, as if by that act she were {{shutting}} her sister for evermore out of her heart and life. Salome, strung up to the last pitch of nervous tension, felt intuitively the significance of that closed door. For a moment she wavered--oh, she could not go against Judith! She was all but turning back to her room when Lionel Hezekiah came running in, and paused to look at her admiringly.|$|R

50|$|After the fire, {{people were}} {{planning}} to rebuild the town. The towns leaders made a few changes, First {{they said they would}} build the houses further apart, making it <b>harder</b> for the <b>flames</b> to spread. Also, all the houses were now positioned next to the road instead of further away from it, making it easier to escape in case of a fire and the fire not being spread as easily on roads. A lot of changes were also made to roads and houses, such as the Heiden street lying next to the Church walls being widened, The entrance between Bertels and Strucks was widened, and a new street was built under the church walls.|$|R
40|$|In Italy {{weed control}} {{in urban areas}} is mainly {{performed}} by means of mowing cutting and herbicide distribution. While trimmers are not effective in reducing weed density and they are also potentially injurious for hard surfaces {{and the safety of}} citizens and operators, chemical control induces resistance to active compounds in spontaneous plants and it is surely a source of environmental pollution and a risk factor for the health of human beings and animals. For this reason the use of herbicides in urban areas is strictly regulated by laws. As an alternative to ordinary weed control devices, thermal equipments can be used successfully for weed control on <b>hard</b> surfaces. <b>Flaming</b> machines are the most efficient among thermal devices and they are suitable for treatments in many urban contexts. The aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of different weed managements (flaming, mowing, herbicide application, and flaming+herbicide application) on weed dynamics in two cities of Tuscany (Central Italy) and to compare the total working time and costs of operations in order to define a proper strategy for the control of weed flora growing on hard surfaces in a typical mediterranean environment. A hand knapsack device and three motorized flaming prototypes were also projected, built and tested at the University of Pisa. One of the self-propelled versions of the flaming machines was also used for a trial of weed management in the city of Livorno between October 2006 and June 2007 in order to evaluate its technical performances and effectiveness...|$|R
5000|$|Through such {{discrimination}} we may [...] "get as many pulsations {{as possible}} into the given time": [...] "To burn always with this <b>hard,</b> gem-like <b>flame,</b> {{to maintain this}} ecstasy, is success in life." [...] Forming habits means failure on our part, for habit connotes the stereotypical. [...] "While all melts under our feet," [...] Pater wrote, [...] "we may well catch at any exquisite passion, or any contribution to knowledge that seems by a lifted horizon to set the spirit free for a moment, or any stirring of the senses, or work of the artist's hands. Not to discriminate every moment some passionate attitude in those about us in the brilliancy of their gifts is, on this short day of frost and sun, to sleep before evening." [...] The resulting [...] "quickened, multiplied consciousness" [...] counters our insecurity {{in the face of}} the flux. Moments of vision may come from simple natural effects, as Pater notes elsewhere in the book: [...] "A sudden light transfigures a trivial thing, a weathervane, a windmill, a winnowing flail, the dust in the barn door; a moment - and the thing has vanished, because it was pure effect; but it leaves a relish behind it, a longing that the accident may happen again." [...] Or they may come from [...] "intellectual excitement", from philosophy, science and the arts. Here we should [...] "be for ever testing new opinions, never acquiescing in a facile orthodoxy"; and of these, a passion for the arts, [...] "a desire of beauty", has (in the summary of one of Pater's editors) [...] "the greatest potential for staving off the sense of transience, because in the arts the perceptions of highly sensitive minds are already ordered; we are confronted with a reality already refined and we are able to reach the personality behind the work".|$|R
6000|$|Men, being reasonable, must hurry about {{town when}} the {{thermometer}} is at something fabulous, wearing black clothes, going to parties, and larding the lean earth. Beasts {{are not so}} foolish. To the pious Brahmin Vishnu accords the power of becoming what animal he pleases, with {{a break in the}} lease, so to speak, when circumstances alter. Had a sage this power at this moment he would become a cow, standing up to her middle in the clear, cool water of the Kennet, under the shade of a hanging willow tree. What bliss can equal that of a cow thus engaged? Her life must, indeed, be burning with a <b>hard</b> gem-like <b>flame.</b> She must be plucking the flower of a series of exquisite moments. The rich, deep grass, with the buttercups and forget-me-nots, is behind her, but she has had enough of that, and is open to more spiritual pleasures. The kingfishers and water- wagtails flit about her. The water-rat jumps into the stream with a soft plash, and his black body scuttles along to the opposite bank. The green dragon-flies float hither and thither; the beautiful frail-winged water- flies float over trout too lazy to snatch at them. The cow, in her sensuous nirvana, may see and marvel at the warm boating-man as he tows two stout young ladies in a heavy boat, or labours with the oar. Her pleasure is far more enduring than that of the bathers in the lasher up stream, and she has an enormous advantage over the contemplative man trying to lie on the grass and enjoy nature, for he really is not enjoying nature. The pleasures of lying on the grass are chiefly those of imagination. You cannot get into a truly comfortable position. Your back has a lump of grass under it here, or your arm tingles and [...] "falls asleep," [...] as children say. No attitude will enable you to read, and the black flies hover around and alight on such of your features as are tempting--to a fly. Then you begin to be quite sure it is damp, and, as you have nothing else to sit on, you sit down on your book, which no one can call comfortable.|$|R
40|$|Weed {{control is}} a major issue not only in {{agriculture}} but also on hard surfaces in urban and suburban contexts. Weeds can cause serious damage to urban structures and are often considered {{as a sign of}} neglect. Moreover, citizens are becoming increasingly aware of environmental pollution and its potential risks for their health. Flaming represents a concrete alternative to herbicide applications on <b>hard</b> urban surfaces. <b>Flaming</b> can also be a good alternative to mechanical means (e. g., string trimmers) which can seriously damage surfaces because they are too intense and in any case are often not effective. The aim of this work is to describe LPG fed flaming machines designed and built at the University of Pisa, Italy. Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is a flammable mixture of hydrocarbon gases– propane and butane. Four different machines were developed and tested in four different urban and sub-urban contexts. A small backpack flamer equipped with a manual lance was tested on a stonewall, a trolley machine with a manual lance was used to clean the base of ornamental trees, a self-propelled machine was tested in a railway station, and a mounted machine was used in a suburban cycle way. Flaming was compared to the ordinary weed control systems such as using herbicides or mowing. The results showed that flaming can be both less expensive and more effective (on average less that 1 € m- 2 year- 1 maintaining weed cover below 5 % to 6 %) than the ordinary treatments in urban areas. Flaming was more effective than mowing in the suburban area but much more expensive, thus an integrated approach would be advisable in this context. Future research should be devoted to improving the efficiency of the treatment, using for example, new burners with secondary air and precision agriculture technologies...|$|R
60|$|Wonderful then, {{those days}} at Crockham Cottage, the first days, all alone {{save for the}} woman who came {{to work in the}} mornings. Marvellous days, when she had all his tall, supple, fine-fleshed youth to herself, for herself, and he had her like a ruddy fire into which he could cast himself for rejuvenation. Ah, that it might never end, this passion, this marriage! The flame of their two bodies burnt again into that old cottage, that was haunted already by so much by-gone, {{physical}} desire. You could not be in the dark room for an hour without the influences coming over you. The hot blood-desire of by-gone yeomen, there in this old den where they had lusted and bred for so many generations. The silent house, dark, with thick, timbered walls and the big black chimney-place, and the sense of secrecy. Dark, with low, little windows, sunk into the earth. Dark, like a lair where strong beasts had lurked and mated, lonely at night and lonely by day, left to themselves and their own intensity for so many generations. It seemed to cast a spell on the two young people. They became different. There was a curious secret glow about them, a certain slumbering <b>flame</b> <b>hard</b> to understand, that enveloped them both. They too felt that they did not belong to the London world any more. Crockham had changed their blood: the sense of the snakes that lived and slept even in their own garden, in the sun, so that he, going forward with the spade, would see a curious coiled brownish pile on the black soil, which suddenly would start up, hiss, and dazzle rapidly away, hissing. One day Winifred heard the strangest scream from the flower-bed under the low window of the living room: ah, the strangest scream, like the very soul of the dark past crying aloud. She ran out, and saw a long brown snake on the flower-bed, and in its flat mouth the one hind leg of a frog was striving to escape, and screaming its strange, tiny, bellowing scream. She looked at the snake, and from its sullen flat head it looked at her, obstinately. She gave a cry, and it released the frog and slid angrily away.|$|R
