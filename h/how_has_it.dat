40|$|This paper {{contains}} {{an analysis of}} the activity-based costing (ABC) literature which has been accumulated in the UK and USA accounting journals over the fourteen-year period since the first articles on ABC emerged. This evidence is used both longitudinally and cross-sectionally to gain insights into how ABC started, <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been communicated, <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been researched, <b>how</b> <b>it</b> is constituted, <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> generated attention and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> developed and changed. From the analysis conclusions are drawn on these issues and on the role of academic research when confronted by a new practical innovation of this type. ...|$|R

6000|$|More talk {{outside the}} door. Nedda, {{alone with her}} lover, {{crouched}} forward on her knees, and put her lips to his.

60|$|And {{then he went}} on, {{and told}} us <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> taken him {{half an hour to}} land <b>it,</b> and <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> broken his rod.

'And talk of Time {{slipping}} by you, {{as if it}} was {{an animal}} at rustic sports with its tail soaped,' said Mr Inspector (again, a subject which nobody had approached); 'why, well you may.

6000|$|... "Come, Doodles, {{you go on}} {{with your}} game," [...] said he; [...] "it's you to play." [...] Doodles turned to the table, and scientifically {{pocketed}} the ball on which he played; then laid his own ball close under the cushion, picked up a shilling and put it into his waistcoat pocket, holding a lighted cigar in his mouth the while, and then he came back to his friend.

6000|$|... 'You are strict to your time,' {{said the}} chief robber. 'I {{knew you would}} be.

60|$|And then, <b>how</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> answered, {{that plan}} of his of keeping her all to himself? He, Dr Thorne, {{was still a}} poor man; the gift of saving money had not been his; he had ever had a {{comfortable}} house for her to live in, and, in spite of Doctors Fillgrave, Century, Rerechild, and others, had made from his profession an income sufficient for their joint wants; {{but he had not}} done as others do: he had no three or four thousand pounds in the Three per Cents. on which Mary might live in some comfort when he should die. Late in life he had insured his life for eight hundred pounds; and to that, and that only, had he to trust for Mary's future maintenance. <b>How</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> answered, then, this plan of letting her be unknown to, and undreamed of by, those who were as near to her on her mother's side as he was on the father's?

6000|$|Sir Peregrine {{when this}} was said to him got {{up from his chair}} and walked away to the window. He was not angry with her that she so spoke to him.

6000|$|Nearly {{eighteen}} months elapsed in this protracted exile. To {{me they were}} so many ages. Ardent and impetuous by nature, I scarcely know how I should have supported so long an absence, had I not felt assured that the faith of Bianca was equal to my own. At length my father died. Life went from him almost imperceptibly. I hung over him in mute affliction, and watched the expiring spasms of nature.

60|$|And {{the fourth}} night {{came and went}} and still there was nothing. Then a great discouragement fell upon the people; the army was on the way, but why did it not arrive? Suddenly here and there people were heard asking about the letter from the Pope. No one had seen the messenger. <b>How</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> come?

Old Nancy Dryden ran up to the old nursery with it, and laid it in a great wooden tub full of hot water, and was giving it warm milk to drink, and dandling it, almost before the men knew what had happened.|$|R
