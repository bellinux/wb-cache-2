5|$|Grand Theft Auto clones allow {{players to}} freely explore the game world, which is {{typically}} {{on the scale}} of an entire city. Some games base their level design on real world cities, such as London, New York City, and Los Angeles. Players are usually able to navigate by vehicle or on foot. Some games put greater emphasis on leaping, climbing, and even swimming. Exploring the world is not just necessary to complete objectives, but also to gain valuable items, weapons, and vehicles. Different parts of the game world may be controlled by different enemy factions, who will attempt to stop the player in a variety of ways. However, more recent games in this genre allow players to acquire their own territory. The freedom of navigating a huge game world may be overwhelming or confusing for new players. Game designers <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a variety of navigational aids to solve this problem. A mini-map feature is common, while Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto IV {{go so far as to}} offer a GPS service. Games without these navigation tools are sometimes criticized as confusing.|$|E

25|$|Classically, scrolls of {{the books}} of the Bible have always been divided by blank spaces at the end (petuhoth) or middle (setumoth) of the lines.

While Cardinal Hugo de Sancto Caro is also known to <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a systematic division of the Bible (between 1244 and 1248), it is Langton's arrangement of the chapters that remains in use today.|$|E

It is found, however, that very few, if any, languages are entirely one direction or the other. Linguists <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a number of theories to explain the inconsistencies, sometimes positing a more consistent underlying order, with the phenomenon of phrasal movement being used to explain the surface deviations.|$|E
25|$|The {{leader of}} Islington borough council, Margaret Hodge, had chaired {{the meeting of}} the Labour london boroughs in June 1984 at which the {{strategy}} of setting no rate had been decided upon, and according to Ken Livingstone, claimed to <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the idea. Hodge was one of the public leaders of the campaign and on the evening of Thursday 7 March the council organised a people's festival in the civic auditorium while the council formally voted not to set a rate. On 22 April the council published the results of an opinion poll it had commissioned which showed that 57% of people in Islington supported the council in the struggle, with 20% supporting the Government. Asked what the council should do, the poll found 37% wanted the council to continue not to set a rate, 27% wanted the council to resign and force an election on the issue, and 21% wanted the council to set a legal rate.|$|E
25|$|Classical {{figures have}} not {{discussed}} {{the subject as}} it has only {{come up in the}} 19th century. Contemporaries <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> several distinct stances. One stance is that adaptation, or evolution on a micro scale, is accepted within a species, but cross-species evolution, that is evolution from one species into another species, is not as the human beginning is considered to be miraculous. However, this traditional thought would not conflict with the view that human-like beings could have been created around the same time as human beings, which, in this view, would explain the fossil records that look human but are not. Another stance is that since evolution is the simplest explanation it is the most reasonable to accept under the condition that it is not random but occurs only with the permission of God every step of the way. One particular argument that supports the idea that evolution is possible is the one stating that in that the stages of human development in evolution are akin to the distinct stages of development acknowledged in the Koran. The final stance completely rejects cross-species evolution across all organisms, but approves of adaptation (micro evolution).|$|E

Lyricist Howard Dietz claims to <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> the song's name and helped with the lyrics, but received no official credit.

Chapman, however, was able to refine and improve on the idea better than his rivals, melding the tactical change with his own ideas on counter-attacking football, pacy wingers and a strong defence. Chapman himself summed it up by saying: [...] "the most opportune time for scoring is immediately after repelling an attack, because opponents are then strung out in the wrong half of the field." ...|$|E
