500|$|After {{watching}} Herbie Hancock perform [...] "Rockit" [...] at the 26th Annual Grammy Awards in 1984, Goldstein {{became obsessed}} with deejaying, realizing <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted {{to do for a}} career. He attended the Quaker school Friends' Central. When he was 14, Herbert was incarcerated for committing bank fraud, and his mother subsequently moved to Los Angeles with Goldstein and his sister.|$|E
500|$|Myth was {{reviewed}} by two separate critics from RPGFan. Eric Farand praised the album, saying {{that half of}} the songs were great and the other half were [...] "pretty good"; he called out [...] "Village Pride" [...] as one of the best. Like Fagen he felt that {{the second half of the}} album contained several tracks that were [...] "forgettable, phoned-in or a poor song selection for this album". He agreed with Schweitzer that the majority of the arrangements did not deviate much from the original compositions, but said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> expected and wanted from an orchestral arrangement album. Stephen Meyerink, in his review, was less receptive to the album, saying that [...] "It's good. It's not great." [...] He praised the technical quality of the performances, especially those of the string section of the orchestra, but criticized the lack of originality in the arrangements. He noted [...] "Soaring" [...] and [...] "Bonds of Sea and Flames" [...] as some of the few tracks he felt brought something unique to the arrangement. He felt that while the original compositions were strong, that the album felt [...] "rushed" [...] and [...] "phoned-in" [...] with poor track selection, made more to tie in with the release of Xenogears on the PlayStation Network that year than for the love of the music.|$|E
2500|$|Israel, as Brody put it, {{had opened}} his eyes. [...] He had never {{previously}} traveled anywhere outside the U.S. [...] Before {{he arrived in}} Israel, all he knew about <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had studied in Hebrew school. [...] To his surprise, rather than arriving in Biblical Israel (with people riding camels and living in tents), {{he found himself in}} a modern society in which {{for the first time he}} met Jews from around the globe. [...] The experience was a culture shock, and he was attracted to the culture and the everyday life. [...] It changed the NBA-bound basketball player's goals in life. Eventually, because he was Jewish he agreed to take up the challenge and stay. His decision completely changed Israeli basketball.|$|E

No, {{that is not}} quite it: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thinks he can stupefy a {{particularly}} and unspeakably dull reader into thinking <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thinks. He makes that comment {{with the knowledge that}} Shelley is in love with this woman's daughter, and that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> because of the fascinations of these two that Shelley has deserted his wife--for this month, considering all the circumstances, and his new passion, and his employment of the time, amounted to desertion; that is its rightful name. We cannot know how the wife regarded it and felt about it; but if she could have read the letter which Shelley was writing to Hogg four or five days later, we could guess her thought and how she felt.

2500|$|His trips outside Israel are {{coordinated by}} the Israeli Foreign Ministry and by Israel's {{embassies}} and consulates. He speaks at schools, universities, Jewish and non-Jewish organizations and community centers, synagogues, Christian events, African-American organizations, and fundraising events. [...] While {{he seeks to}} encourage those people who support Israel, {{a major focus of}} his—which accords with a suggestion he was given by Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz—is on those people who are undecided about Israel. [...] His discussions with groups outside of Israel have touched on the tension between terrorism and restrictions on freedom of movement, Israel's security fence, Israel's Black Ethiopian Jews, and the role of Israeli Arabs in Israeli society. [...] Brody said that he took on the role because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted to do—serve the State of Israel.|$|E
2500|$|In 1968 {{he joined}} Mabel Greer's Toyshop as {{keyboard}} player with Peter Banks (guitar), Chris Squire (bass), Jon Anderson (vocals), and Bill Bruford (drums). In July 1968 {{they changed the}} name of the band to Yes, and with this line-up released two albums: Yes (1969) and Time and a Word (1970), and a few singles. In 1971, Yes released The Yes Album with guitarist Steve Howe replacing Banks. The opening track, [...] "Yours Is No Disgrace", was co-composed by Kaye, his first recorded composition. After a concert at The Crystal Palace in August 1971, Kaye was asked to leave the group. [...] His musical conservatism is often cited as the reason for his expulsion -- the group was looking to evolve, incorporating the Mellotron and synthesizers in their sound, while Kaye refused to play anything other than the Hammond organ and piano, namely because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was most comfortable playing. Kaye {{had been part of the}} original recording sessions for some of the songs that appeared on Fragile, such as [...] "Heart of the Sunrise", with his keyboard parts being re-recorded by Rick Wakeman.|$|E
2500|$|Kodansha (publisher of the Tsubasa and xxxHolic manga) {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} developing both films and contacted Production I.G, who chose Toru Kawaguchi and Tetsuya Nakatake as producers. Since Tsubasa was popular in Japan and Production I.G was well-known, Natakate wanted viewers to enjoy the film. Directed by Itsuro Kawasaki and written by Midori Goto and Junichi Fujisaku, its characters were designed by Yoko Kikuchi and its music composed by Yuki Kajiura. Director Itsuro Kawasaki met producer Nakatake, who told him that they were working in The Princess of the Birdcage Kingdom but had not chosen a director. According to Kawasaki, he had declined an offer from Production I.G because {{he was working on}} an anime television series. It was the director's first feature animated film; Kawasaki was initially sceptical about making a film based on Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, because he thought the market was saturated and wanted to focus on less-popular series. Since he had heard that Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle was an entertaining manga, Kawasaki read it when the film finished development. He was satisfied because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had in mind when he made the film, and praised Clamp's illustrations and designs. When Yoko Kikuchi was chosen as character designer, Kawasaki said, [...] "we were very lucky"; he was familiar with Kikuchi's work, and she was fond of the character Sakura.|$|E
