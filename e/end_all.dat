A television crew working on an architectural programme locates the monster in Westminster Abbey, and Quatermass and troops of the British Army rush in to destroy it in the hour before it brings about doomsday. Quatermass convinces the consciousness of the three crewmen buried deep inside the creature to turn against it and destroy it; this appeal to the last remains of their humanity succeeds in defeating the organism.|$|E
5|$|Brown, Barnes and Morris {{shared the}} opening duties against the visiting Indians; their batting averages were 43.00, 52.25 and 42.66 respectively. With Brown recovered, the Australian {{selectors}} dropped Barnes {{for the first}} two Tests against the Indians. However, Brown struggled and made only 18 and 11 runsAustralia batted once in both Testsand was then dropped for Barnes, who made only 12 and 15 in the Third Test. Retained for the Fourth Test, Barnes made 112 in an Australian victory. Morriswhose place was securewas rested for the Fifth and final Test to give Brown another chance to show that he was worthy of selection. Barnes made 33 while Brown made 99 run out as Australia completed a 40 series win. In the <b>end,</b> <b>all</b> three were selected for the England tour, though Barnes had to give assurances about the amount of contact he would have with his wifestill living in Scotlandbefore he was confirmed.

5|$|During the Australian {{season of}} 194748, which preceded {{the tour of}} England, Morris played {{in the first four}} Tests against the touring Indians, scoring 45 and an unbeaten 100 in the Third Test victory in Melbourne. He was omitted for the Fifth Test because the {{selectors}} wanted to trial other candidates for the 1948 tour of England. Morris ended the series with 209 runs at a batting average of 52.25, making him the third highest scorer as Australia won 40. During the series, he had opened with both Bill Brown, the veteran who had been a mainstay of Australian teams of the 1930s, and New South Wales teammate Sid Barnes. The Australian selectors chose Brown for the first two Tests against the Indians, but he struggled and made only 18 and 11—Australia batted once in both Tests—and was then dropped for Barnes, who made only 12 and 15 in the Third Test. Retained for the Fourth Test, Barnes made 112 in an Australian victory. Morris—whose place was secure—was rested for the Fifth Test to give Brown another chance to show that he was worthy of selection.

2500|$|Powell made {{a speech}} in Morecambe on 11 October 1968 on the economy, setting out alternative, radical free-market {{policies}} that would later be called the 'Morecambe Budget'. Powell used the financial year of 1968–9 to show how income tax could be halved from 8s 3d to 4s 3d in the pound (basic rate cut from 41% to 21%) and how capital gains tax and Selective Employment Tax could be abolished without reducing expenditure on defence or the social services. These tax reductions required a saving of £2,855 million, {{and this would be}} funded by eradicating losses in the nationalised industries and denationalising the profit-making state concerns; <b>ending</b> <b>all</b> housing subsidies except for those who could not afford their own housing; <b>ending</b> <b>all</b> foreign aid; <b>ending</b> <b>all</b> grants and subsidies in agriculture; <b>ending</b> <b>all</b> assistance to development areas; <b>ending</b> <b>all</b> investment grants; and abolishing the National Economic Development Council and the Prices and Incomes Board. The cuts in taxation would also allow the state to borrow from the public to spend on capital projects such as hospitals and roads and spend on [...] "the firm and humane treatment of criminals".|$|R

5|$|The {{marriage}} ceremony was conducted {{according to the}} Catholic rite between 19 May, when Catherine arrived in Milodraž near Fojnica accompanied by her father, and 22 May 1446. The wedding was attended by a delegation from the Republic of Ragusa (Dubrovnik), but it failed to <b>end</b> <b>all</b> internal strife, since leading noblemen such as Ivaniš Pavlović (Catherine's first cousin, lord of eastern Bosnia) and Petar Vojsalić (lord of Donji Kraji) snubbed it. The coronation, planned {{to take place in}} Mile near Visoko immediately after the wedding, was apparently postponed. The new queen consort converted to Catholicism ("laid aside Patarin errors"), likely prior to her marriage, and was allowed by Pope Eugene to choose for herself two chaplains from among Bosnian Franciscans. The Queen's father appears to have contemplated converting too, but eventually gave up the idea and remained an adherent of the Bosnian Church until his death.|$|E
