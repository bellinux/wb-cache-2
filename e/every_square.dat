The bunkers (Albanian: bunkerët) were built during the communist government of Enver Hoxha from the 1960s to the 1980s; by 1983 a total of 173,371 concrete bunkers had been constructed around the country.|$|E

For <b>every</b> <b>square</b> foot of green roof used in one study the savings amounted to $5.80 energy-wise. There were also savings seen in the emissions, water, and maintenance categories. Overall, the savings amounted to $52.90-$71.30 on average while the cost of going green totaled -$3.00-$5.00.|$|E

In large areas, according to maps of U.S. bombing sites, it appears that nearly <b>every</b> <b>square</b> mile of land was hit by bombs.|$|E
50|$|The {{minimum number}} of transversals of a Latin square is also an open problem. H. J. Ryser conjectured (Oberwolfach, 1967) that <b>every</b> Latin <b>square</b> of odd order has one.

5|$|Among other {{inhabitants}} of London are 10,000 red foxes, {{so that there}} are now 16 foxes for <b>every</b> <b>square</b> mile (2.6 square kilometres) of London. These urban foxes are noticeably bolder than their country cousins, sharing the pavement with pedestrians and raising cubs in people's backyards. Foxes have even sneaked into the Houses of Parliament, where one was found asleep on a filing cabinet. Another broke into the grounds of Buckingham Palace, reportedly killing some of Queen ElizabethII's prized pink flamingos. Generally, however, foxes and city folk appear to get along. A survey in 2001 by the London-based Mammal Society found that 80 percent of 3,779 respondents who volunteered to keep a diary of garden mammal visits liked having them around. This sample cannot be taken to represent Londoners as a whole.|$|E

For every five-cun layer of earth, two men, {{standing}} face to face, should tamp six times with pestles, each man pounding three times on a dent; then tamp four times on each dent, two men again standing face to face, each pounding twice on the same dent; then tamp two more times, each man pounding once. Following this, tamp the surface with pestles or stamp with feet randomly to even out the surface. Every five-cun layer of earth should be compressed to three cun; every three-cun layer of brick and stone to one and a half cun.|$|E
5|$|Portsmouth, as {{the most}} densely {{populated}} city in the United Kingdom, is the only city whose population density exceeds that of London. As of the 2011 census, the city had 205,400 residents. This equates to 5,100 people living in <b>every</b> <b>square</b> kilometre (0.4 sq.mi.), which is eleven {{times more than the}} regional average of 440 people per square kilometre and more than London, which has 4,900 people per square kilometre. The city used to be even more densely populated, with the 1951 census showing a population of 233,545. In a reversal of that decrease, the population of the city has been gradually increasing since the 1990s. With about 860,000 residents, the South Hampshire built-up area is the fifth-largest urban area in England and the largest in South East England, forming the centre of one of the United Kingdom's most populous metropolitan areas.|$|E
30|$|Then <b>every</b> {{homotopy}} cocartesian <b>square</b> in C is weakly {{equivalent to}} a cofiber <b>square,</b> and conversely, <b>every</b> cofiber <b>square</b> is homotopy cocartesian. In fact, a cocartesian square (2.4) is homotopy cocartesian as soon as X is cofibrant, and either f or g is in C (for a proof, see e.g. [26] or Sect.  7.2). For fiber squares, the situation is dual.|$|R
