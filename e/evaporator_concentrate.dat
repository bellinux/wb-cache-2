To provide a technical basis to permit the waste treatment facility, a relatively organic-rich Hanford Tank 241 -AN- 107 waste simulant was spiked with 14 target volatile, semi-volatile and pesticide compounds, and evaporated under vacuum in a bench-scale natural circulation evaporator fitted with an industrial stack off-gas sampler at the Savannah River Technology Center. An evaporator material balance for the target organics was calculated by combining liquid stream mass and analytical data with off-gas emissions estimates obtained using EPA SW- 846 Methods.

40|$|Polyethylene {{microencapsulation}} physically homogenizes and incorporates mixed waste particles {{within a}} molten polymer matrix, forming a solidified final waste form upon cooling. Each individual particle of waste is embedded within the polymer block and {{is surrounded by}} a durable, leach-resistant coating. The process has been successfully applied for the treatment of a broad range of mixed wastes, including <b>evaporator</b> <b>concentrate</b> salts, soil, sludges, incinerator ash, off-gas blowdown solutions, decontamination solutions, molten salt oxidation process residuals, ion exchange resins, granular activated carbon, shredded dry active waste, spill clean-up residuals, depleted uranium powders, and failed grout waste forms. For waste streams containing high concentrations of soluble toxic metal contaminants, additives can be used to further reduce leachability, thus improving waste loadings while meeting or exceeding regulatory disposal criteria. In this configuration, contaminants are both chemically stabilized and physically solidified, making the process a true stabilization/solidification (S/S) technology. Unlike conventional hydraulic cement grouts or thermosetting polymers, thermoplastic polymers such as polyethylene require no chemical. reaction for solidification. Thus, a stable, solid, final waste form product is assured on cooling. Variations in waste chemistry over time do not affect processing parameters and do not require reformulation of the recipe. Incorporation of waste particles within the polymer matrix serves as an aggregate and improves the mechanical strength and integrity of the waste form. The compressive strength of polyethylene microencapsulated waste forms varies based on the type and quantity of waste encapsulated, but is typically between 7 and 17. 2 MPa (1000 and 2500 psi), well above the minimum strength of 0. 4 MPa (160 psi) recommended by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for low-level radioactive waste forms in support of 10 CFR 61 (NRC, 1991; 1983) Because polyethylene is a relatively new material, it is difficult to predict its long-term durability. However, prior to scale-up of the microencapsulation process, a study was conducted to evaluate potential degradation mechanisms. The study examined potential effects on mechanical integrity from exposure to chemicals and solvents, thermal cycling, saturated environments, microbial attack, and high gamma-radiation fields (Kalb et al., 1991). At ambient temperatures, polyethylene is relatively inert to most chemicals, including organic solvents, acids, and alkaline solutions. Exposure to changes in temperature or saturated soil conditions have been shown to degrade the mechanical integrity of some waste forms, but had little or no measurable impact on polyethylene waste forms. Low-density polyethylene is not susceptible to growth of microbial organisms, a fact that is evidenced by the lack of plastics decomposition in municipal waste landfills. When exposed to gamma-radiation at total doses of up to lo 8 rad, additional cross-linking of the polymer occurs, resulting in increased strength and lower leachability...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{necessity}} for quickly detecting and assessing alpha and beta emitters in the environment, in nuclear fuel processes, and in storage waste has caused {{an increase in}} analyses of gross α (sum of all α emitters in the sample) and gross β (sum of all β emitters in the sample) activity. In fact, these analyses {{have been the most}} popular method for measuring radio-activity. Scintillation counting allows for the detection and quantification of α- and β-emitting radionuclides in an accurate and reproducible way without self-absorption problems. Optimization of α/β separation is achieved by using pulse-shape dis-crimination (PSD), calibrated by quantifying event misclassification at any given setting for pure α and β emitters. We studied α/β separation for different scintillant/vial combinations. We observed that both the optimum PSD level and total interference value were dependent upon the sample quenching. Thus, we propose a procedure for analyzing gross α and β activity in radio-active waste streams, such as ion exchange resins and <b>evaporator</b> <b>concentrates,</b> from Spanish nuclear power plants. The sam-ples were prepared using standard solutions of radionuclides that are normally present in these types of samples.

This report documents the non-radioactive simulant tests impacts of glycolate on storage and evaporation of Savannah River Site high-level waste.

In order to identify the composition of the fouling deposit, the behavior of the mineral fraction was studied during the concentration by evaporation of by-products of the manufacture of fresh cheeses and acid casein, lactic acid whey and hydrochloric acid whey respectively. These latter have the same pH (about 4. 6) and are strongly mineralized, but differ from their mineral composition: lactic acid whey contains a high level of lactic acid but no citrate ion whereas hydrochloric acid whey contains citrate ion and no lactic acid. Concentration of both wheys was performed using a pilot-scale falling-film <b>evaporator.</b> <b>Concentrates</b> at different concentration factors (up to 6) were prepared and their mineral composition were determined experimentally.

The behavior of the mineral fraction of both acid wheys during evaporation was shown very different. The concentration of lactic acid whey did not lead to the formation of mineral precipitate of calcium phosphate or other salts. On the contrary, precipitation of calcium citrate occurred into the concentrate during the concentration of hydrochloric acid whey. Moreover, losses of citrate and calcium in the concentrates were deduced, suggesting calcium citrate deposit {{on the surface of the}} evaporation tubes.
