40|$|OBJECTIVES: To compare {{histological}} with <b>genome</b> <b>detection</b> {{methods for}} diagnosis of herpesvirus infection in eye and brain of HIV infected patients undergoing necropsy and to correlate these findings with both antemortem clinical findings and postmortem evidence of extraocular herpesvirus infection, {{especially in the}} CNS. METHODS: A prospective study of 31 consecutive HIV infected patients undergoing necropsy. In life 11 patients had been assessed by an ophthalmologist because of ocular symptoms. Ocular and brain samples were examined for herpesviruses by conventional histological methods and by nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) for all eight human herpesviruses; evidence of extraneural herpesvirus infection was sought by histological methods. RESULTS: Although only 12 out of 31 patients (39 %) had antemortem clinical evidence of ocular or CNS herpesvirus associated disease, herpesviruses were detected by nPCR in eye and brain from 26 (84 %) patients; six patients {{had more than one}} herpesvirus infection. There was concordance between ocular and CNS findings in 15 of 19 patients (79 %) with CMV infection. 17 of 31 patients (55 %) had extraocular or CNS CMV infection at necropsy. <b>Genome</b> <b>detection</b> using nPCR was superior to histological methods for diagnosis of ocular and CNS herpesvirus infection. CONCLUSION: Herpesvirus infection of eye and brain was a frequent finding at necropsy in this group of HIV infected patients; almost a fifth were co-infected by more than one herpesvirus.

40|$|Since the {{emergence}} of high-throughput genome sequencing platforms and more recently the next-generation platforms, the genome databases are growing at an astronomical rate. Tremendous efforts have been invested {{in recent years in}} under-standing intriguing complexities beneath the vast ocean of genomic data. This is apparent in the spurt of computational methods for interpreting these data in the past few years. Genomic data in-terpretation is notoriously difficult, partly owing to the inherent heterogeneities appearing at different scales.

The costs and calendar day of first detection of these different surveillance systems were compared under three different epidemiological scenarios: very low level circulation, low level recurrent circulation, and epidemic situation.

40|$|Abstract:- The {{presence}} of repeated sequences {{is a fundamental}} feature of biological <b>genomes.</b> The <b>detection</b> of tandem repeats is important in biology and medicine {{as it can be}} used for phylogenic studies and disease diagnosis. A major difficulty in identification of repeats arises {{from the fact that the}} repeat units can be either exact or imperfect, in tandem or dispersed, and of unspecified length. Many of the methods for detecting repeated sequences are part of the digital signal processing field. These methods involve the application of a kind of transformation. Applying a transform technique requires mapping the symbolic domain into the numeric domain in such a way that no additional structure is placed on the symbolic sequence beyond that inherent to it. Therefore the numerical representation of genomic signals is very important. This paper presents results obtained by combining grey level spectrograms with two novel numerical representations to isolate position and length of DNA repeats...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{increasing}} number of sequenced prokaryotic genomes contains a wealth of genomic data {{that needs to be}} effectively analysed. A set of statistical tools exists for such analysis, but their strengths and weaknesses have not been fully explored. The statistical methods we are concerned with here are mainly used to examine similarities between archaeal and bacterial DNA from different genomes. These methods compare observed genomic frequencies of fixed-sized oligonucleotides with expected values, which can be determined by genomic nucleotide content, smaller oligonucleotide frequencies, or be based on specific statistical distributions. Advantages with these statistical methods include measurements of phylogenetic relationship with relatively small pieces of DNA sampled from almost anywhere within <b>genomes,</b> <b>detection</b> of foreign/conserved DNA, and homology searches. Our aim was to explore the reliability and best suited applications for some popular methods, which include relative oligonucleotide frequencies (ROF), di- to hexanucleotide zero'th order Markov methods (ZOM) and 2. order Markov chain Method (MCM). Tests were performed on distant homology searches with large DNA sequences, detection of foreign/conserved DNA, and plasmid-host similarity comparisons. Additionally, the reliability of the methods was tested by comparing both real and random genomic DNA. Results Our findings show that the optimal method is context dependent. ROFs were best suited for distant homology searches, whilst the hexanucleotide ZOM and MCM measures were more reliable measures in terms of phylogeny. The dinucleotide ZOM method produced high correlation values when used to compare real genomes to an artificially constructed random genome with similar %GC, and should therefore be used with care. The tetranucleotide ZOM measure was a good measure to detect horizontally transferred regions, and when used to compare the phylogenetic relationships between plasmids and hosts, significant correlation (R 2 = 0. 4) was found with genomic GC content and intra-chromosomal homogeneity. Conclusion The statistical methods examined are fast, easy to implement, and powerful for a number of different applications involving genomic sequence comparisons. However, none of the measures examined were superior in all tests, and therefore the choice of the statistical method should depend on the task at hand. </p...|$|R
