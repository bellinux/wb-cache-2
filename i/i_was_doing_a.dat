500|$|During Howard's solo concerts from 1983to 1999, [...] "Shivers" [...] was {{the song}} most {{requested}} by audience members. However, {{by the time}} of his final tour in 2009—the year he died—he had stopped receiving requests for it. In an October 2009 interview, Howard commented on his relationship with the song, and its position in his setlists, stating: [...] "I have just tried, perhaps finally successfully, to divorce myself from the song. It's impossible for me to recreate what I was trying to do when I wrote that song so whilst I can see that people have an attachment to it, I don't. I feel like, when I did use to do it in shows, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> cover of some song that had been around forever. That's how it felt. And I guess that is a strange way to feel about a song you wrote, so yeah, I am happy to not have to do it these days".|$|E
500|$|From {{the age of}} thirteen, Mitchell {{was educated}} at Abingdon School, a public school in Oxfordshire. Having always been top of the class at Primary school and Prep school, once he moved to Abingdon, he {{realised}} that {{there were plenty of}} people more intelligent than he was; so he turned his attention to debating and drama, [...] "where [...] had a chance of being the best". There, Mitchell often took part in plays, [...] "largely because you got to play cards backstage." [...] His roles mainly consisted of small minute-long parts, until he won the role of Rabbit in Winnie-the-Pooh. This {{was the first time that}} he was [...] "consciously aware <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> performance" [...] and that that [...] "was better, even, than playing cards." [...] Mitchell had been [...] "obsessed" [...] with comedy writing since his school days, as he [...] "always felt that doing a joke was the cleverest thing", and [...] "would intrinsically prefer a parody of something to the actual thing itself".|$|E
500|$|After touring in 1992 with drummer Chris Vrenna, the then-core of KMFDM (Konietzko, Esch, Schulz, {{and second}} guitarist Mark Durante) {{returned}} to Chicago {{and found that}} Wax Trax! had filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy to begin corporate reorganization in November 1992. The band went into the studio in 1993 as a group to record its seventh album, Angst, which sold more than 100,000 copies {{over the next two}} years. Esch said after the album's release, [...] "I like this album way more. Money was done in a hurry, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> major Pigface tour, so I didn't have much influence on the album. I really like Angst. I'm totally down with it. We've tried to involve guitar players, we tried to be like a real band, especially in the creative kind of aspect." [...] After the release of Angst, Wax Trax!/TVT Records launched a promotion in which fans were encouraged to devise as many alternate meanings for KMFDM as possible, with more than a thousand submissions resulting.|$|E

500|$|By 1994, Ice {{received}} less publicity and became {{removed from the}} public spotlight. After becoming more interested with the Rastafari movement, Ice became a vegetarian, grew dreadlocks and talked more openly about smoking cannabis. On March 22, 1994, Ice released his second studio album, Mind Blowin'. Reviews were unfavorable. Entertainment Weekly reviewer James Bernard called the album [...] "more clunky than funky".|accessdate=March 7, 2009|last=Bernard|first=James|date=March 25, 1994|publisher=Entertainment Weekly}} Rolling Stone reviewer Danyel Smith praised the song [...] "Get Loose" [...] as [...] "snappy", writing that although the lyrics are [...] "inane", [...] "the song is a thumping party, {{one of the few}} places where Ice loosens up. He sounds solid at the beginning of 'The Wrath' as well ... In 'Now and Forever,' a wet dream kind of song, Ice goes back to goofy lyrics." [...] Allrovi reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that [...] "There isn't a single moment that establishes a distinct musical identity, and the whole thing is rather embarrassing." [...] Primus bassist Les Claypool stated in response to Ice's cannabis-oriented lyrics: [...] "That's all fine and dandy and cute, but it could be misconstrued and manipulated by the wrong people." [...] When asked about the drug oriented sound years later, Vanilla Ice said [...] "A lot of the record is drug oriented because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> lot of drugs at the time". Shortly afterward, SBK went bankrupt.|$|E

2500|$|In another interview, Fisher {{revealed}} {{that she used}} cocaine during the filming of The Empire Strikes Back. [...] "Slowly, I realized <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> bit more drugs than other people and losing my choice in the matter", she noted. In 1985, after months of sobriety, she accidentally overdosed {{on a combination of}} prescription medication and sleeping pills. She was rushed to the hospital, creating the turn of events that led to much of the material in her novel and screenplay, Postcards from the Edge. Asked why she did not take on the role of her story's protagonist, named Suzanne, in the film version, Fisher remarked, [...] "I've already played Suzanne." ...|$|E

2500|$|In a 2005 interview, Heinze {{spoke of}} the {{creative}} frustration {{that led him to}} leave academia. [...] "Even though <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> lot of academic writing," [...] he said, [...] "I had this ceaseless, nagging feeling that I wasn't fulfilling myself creatively... I finally took the plunge into a real fiction project... it became clear to me that creative rather than scholarly writing was my real métier." [...] He chose playwriting, in particular, because of Joe Orton; the intensity, intelligence and dark humor of Orton's plays had fascinated him. In 2006 he left his tenured Full Professorship at USF, moved to New York City, and embarked on a career in playwriting.|$|E
2500|$|Morrison {{concluded}} recording in the summer, when {{he recorded}} {{the rest of}} the songs for the album. Four songs were not used from this session, including the future singles [...] "Real Real Gone" [...] and [...] "Tore Down a la Rimbaud". Neither Knopfler nor Herbie Armstrong were able to produce the guitar tone Morrison wanted, so engineer Jim Stern suggested Chris Michie: [...] "I got the call when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> session in San Francisco. Van's producer Jim Stern said 'Can you get to the Plant [...] in twenty minutes?' I said 'Yeah.' I walked into the studio with my gear as the band and Van were doing ... basic tracks. I was set up and playing {{before the end of the}} song 'She Gives Me Religion'". [...] Michie later added lead guitar overdubs to [...] "Cleaning Windows" [...] and [...] "Aryan Mist". Knopfler's contributions still featured on the final release, but are not as audible as Michie's.|$|E
2500|$|In a November 2014, {{interview}} with The A.V. Club, Reubens explained why the film {{took so long}} to be made, saying: [...] "I think part of what happened with this project is it got leaked probably {{a year and a half}} or two years before we really wanted anyone to know about it. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> Q somewhere, and I said I was writing a movie with a guy named Paul Rust, and the next day a journalist called my manager and said, [...] "Paul Rust is someone very associated with Judd Apatow, can you confirm Judd Apatow is involved in the project?" [...] The whole thing got leaked and we had just started. We didn’t have a script yet or anything, so the script took a year and—I don’t really know the answer. I think two years of it was like premature information out there, and then the last two years it's just been very, very slow to get the right people involved, and we now have such an amazing company involved, and that's the really big announcement that hasn’t been made yet." ...|$|E

2500|$|The lyrical {{themes of}} Currents centre on {{personal}} transition and growing older. Parker's lyrics {{on the album}} are entirely autobiographical. His vocals are clearer and less affected than in prior Tame Impala releases, which is partially owed to him having more pride in his lyrics; he said he {{hoped it would be}} easy for listeners to understand them. Parker considered the primary theme of the album to be a [...] "deep feeling of transition in your psyche," [...] or, in a broad sense, fully entering adulthood. He began learning about the concept of the Saturn return halfway through the recording process, which explained his feelings of reflection. He said, [...] "I was halfway through making the album when I heard about it, and it gave what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> lot more meaning; suddenly things made a lot more sense." [...] Accordingly, on the album his reaction to transition is acceptance, exemplified by the opening song, [...] "Let It Happen". Parker also felt buying the home where he recorded Currents [...] "really changed my perspective about where I saw myself, like a place that I belonged." ...|$|E

5000|$|She {{noted that}} the {{entertainment}} industry tended to typecast models: [...] "For me the girl <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in a photo shoot is a character that is portrayed by me for the shoot. If <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> sexy shoot then I play the sexy model. Now the problem comes {{when you want to}} cross over into other avenues in the industry such as singing or acting and people in the industry see you as just 'sexy'".|$|R

2500|$|Sturridge said he {{preferred}} to play as a centre-forward {{rather than as a}} wide player: [...] "I do still see myself as <b>a</b> striker but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> job for the team and I'm enjoying <b>doing</b> it." [...] <b>As</b> Sturridge transitioned from a wider role into a striker when he joined Liverpool, Sturridge also said that he likens himself on striker Thierry Henry, who [...] "played wide for Juventus and then went to Arsenal and played as a centre-forward." ...|$|R
