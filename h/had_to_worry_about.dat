Once again she led the campaign, lobbying church leaders and politicians, among them the Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, who pledged his support, which culminated in Tony Blair's apology to the Conlon family. Ill, {{she was unable to}} make the trip to London to hear the apology, but her children spoke to her by telephone from the House of Commons. After securing the apology, she mentioned that she no longer <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> dying and what it means.|$|E

25|$|The {{censorship}} in Hamburg {{was relatively}} lax but Campe <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> Prussia, the largest German state {{which had the}} largest market for books (it was estimated that one-third of the German readership was Prussian). Initially, any book which had passed the censor in a German state {{was able to be}} sold in any of the other states but in 1834 this loophole was closed. Campe was reluctant to publish uncensored books as he had bad experience of print runs being confiscated. Heine resisted all censorship. So this issue became a bone of contention between the two.|$|E

But Tabinshwehti made it clear through his emissaries {{that he no longer}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> Ava or Arakan, and that he would continue the siege even during the rainy season. Finally, on 19 May 1542, Minkhaung accepted the offer of amnesty, and surrendered. Minkhaung and his chief queen Thiri Hpone-Htut were sent to Toungoo. Tabinshwehti appointed one of his fathers-in-law Shin Nita viceroy of Prome.|$|E
25|$|Adolescence marks a {{rapid change}} in one's role within a family. Young {{children}} tend to assert themselves forcefully, but are unable to demonstrate much influence over family decisions until early adolescence, when they are increasingly viewed by parents as equals. The adolescent faces the task of increasing independence while preserving a caring relationship {{with his or her}} parents. When children go through puberty, there is often a significant increase in parent–child conflict and a less cohesive familial bond. Arguments often concern minor issues of control, such as curfew, acceptable clothing, and the adolescent's right to privacy, which adolescents may have previously viewed as issues over which their parents had complete authority. Parent-adolescent disagreement also increases as friends demonstrate a greater impact on one another, new influences on the adolescent that may be in opposition to parents' values. Social media has also played an increasing role in adolescent and parent disagreements. While parents never <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> the threats of social media in the past, it has become a dangerous place for children. While adolescents strive for their freedoms, the unknowns to parents of what their child is doing on social media sites is a challenging subject, due to the increasing amount of predators on social media sites. Many parents have very little knowledge of social networking sites {{in the first place and}} this further increases their mistrust. An important challenge for the parent–adolescent relationship is to understand how to enhance the opportunities of online communication while managing its risks. Although conflicts between children and parents increase during adolescence, these are just relatively minor issues. Regarding their important life issues, most adolescents still share the same attitudes and values as their parents.|$|E

500|$|While Rogers' book enjoyed {{financial}} success, it had {{a practical}} purpose—to aid British navigators and possible colonists. Much of Rogers' introduction is devoted to advocacy for the South Seas trade. Rogers notes that had there been a British colony in the South Seas, {{he would not have}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> food supplies for his crew. A third of Rogers' book is devoted to detailed descriptions of the places that he explored, with special emphasis on [...] "such [...] as may be of most use for enlarging our trade". [...] He describes the area of the River Plate in detail because it lay [...] "within the limits of the South Sea Company", whose schemes had not yet burst into financial scandal. Rogers' book was carried by such South Pacific navigators as Admiral George Anson and privateering captains John Clipperton and George Shelvocke.|$|E
500|$|Both men {{describe}} Star Trek {{as having}} put personal pressures on them that negatively affected their family lives. The conversation is mostly guided by Shatner, who prompts Nimoy to discuss issues he had regarding {{the legitimacy of}} consistently portraying an extraterrestrial, and other struggles with his acting career at the time. [...] "It took me a while," [...] Nimoy says, [...] "but I got rid of all that anger when I realized that I never <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> work ever since Star Trek went on the air." [...] Nimoy reveals {{that he was an}} alcoholic {{at the time of the}} original Star Trek series—something that was not publicly known before Mind Meld. He developed [...] "a major drinking habit, probably during the second or third year" [...] of the series, he says, and had his secretary bring him alcohol in paper cups at the end of each day of filming. Nimoy suggests that he became dependent on alcohol because of the deterioration of his marriage to Sandra Zober, his first wife. He says that, since divorcing Zober in 1987 and marrying actress Susan Bay in 1988, he has been a teetotaler.|$|E

500|$|The {{victory at}} Saratoga (and {{to some extent}} Washington's near success at Germantown) were {{influential}} in convincing France to enter the war openly as an as an American ally. [...] French entry into the war changed its dynamics, for the British were no longer sure of command of the seas and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> an invasion of their home islands and other colonial territories across the globe. The British, now {{under the command of}} General Sir Henry Clinton, evacuated Philadelphia in 1778 and returned to New York City, with Washington attacking them along the way at the Battle of Monmouth; this was the last major battle in the north. [...] Prior to the battle Washington gave command of the advance forces to Charles Lee, who had been exchanged earlier in the year. [...] Lee, despite firm instructions from Washington, refused Lafayette's suggestion to launch an organized attack on the British rear, and then retreated when the British turned to face him. When Washington arrived {{at the head of the}} main army, he and Lee had an angry exchange of words, and Washington ordered Lee off the command. [...] Washington, with his army's tactics and ability to execute improved by the training programs of the previous winter, was able to recover, and fought the British to a draw.

500|$|Throughout her career, Ayola {{has been}} outspoken {{on the subject}} of racial {{discrimination}} in the entertainment industry. Describing her motivation, she states: [...] "I am not an overtly political person. I just want fairness". Ayola believes that black actors receive less recognition than their white counterparts, explaining; [...] "If you get a show with six stars and one is black you are more likely to see interviews with the five white actors. [...] They are not being sold as a reason to watch." [...] She believes that her career would have taken her in a different direction were she not of ethnic origin, stating: [...] "I could not have played any of the roles I have played on TV if I was white [...] I am very aware of where the glass ceiling is and it's still very low and expectations are still very low". She has noted having casting directors accept the notion of characters being both black and Welsh to be a particular problem, explaining that: [...] "I get offered a lot of very different roles, but they're never Welsh. [...] The one time I was asked to play a Welsh character on screen was in Tiger Bay for BBC Wales, but I know if that series had been called Radyr Park or Cyncoed Close I wouldn't have been in it". In 2001, Ayola founded a production company and directed a short film entitled Persephone's Playground. She presented the film at the Cannes film festival, using it as part of her campaign for increased black representation in theatre, films and television. The project, however, was largely unsuccessful, with Ayola stating: [...] "it just made me decide that if there's anything I don't want to do, it's produce films, because I'm rubbish at it. I was so bad with the budget that I just said yes to everything and then <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> how to pay for things at the end." [...] In 2008, Ayola offered her support to the [...] campaign Dignity! Period, aiming to provide affordable sanitary protection to Zimbabwean women.|$|E
2500|$|Ortiz fought Andre Berto for the WBC Welterweight title on April 16, 2011, at the Foxwoods Resort Casino, Mashantucket. Hailed as {{the early}} pick for the fight of the year, Ortiz won the fight by {{unanimous}} decision over Berto. They both came out aggressively, then just over a minute into the round, Ortiz landed a shot behind Berto's head and Berto went down. Berto and Ortiz exchanged knockdowns in their fights {{with both of them}} going down twice. Both fighters were hurt in that fight. However, Berto took a lot of punishment while against the ropes and looked to be exhausted after the 6th.

2500|$|In Rope, Granger and John Dall portrayed two {{intellectuals who}} commit a murder simply {{to prove they}} can get away with it. The two {{characters}} and their former professor, played by Jimmy Stewart, were supposed to be homosexual, and Granger and Dall discussed the subtext of their scenes. Because The Hays Office was keeping close tabs on the project, however, the final script was so discreet that Laurents remained uncertain of whether Stewart ever realized that his own character was homosexual. Hitchcock shot the film in continuous, uninterrupted 10-minute takes, the amount of time a reel of Technicolor film lasted, and, as a result, technical problems frequently brought the action to a frustrating halt throughout the 21-day shoot. The film ultimately received mixed reviews, although most critics were impressed by Granger, who in later years said he was happy to be part of the experience, but wondered [...] "what the film would have been like had [...] shot it normally" [...] and [...] "had he not <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> censorship." ...|$|E
2500|$|Amid Tanaka's objections, Noboru Takeshita {{formed a}} [...] "study group" [...] called Soseikai on 7 February 1985, which counted among its ranks 43 of the 121 Tanaka faction members. Weeks after this defection, Tanaka {{suffered}} a stroke on February 27 and became hospitalized, sparking uncertainty {{over the future of}} his faction. His daughter Makiko spirited him from the hospital after authorities refused to give the former prime minister an entire floor, and the Diet session halted entirely while details of Tanaka's condition leaked out to the press. Susumu Nikaido, the titular chairman of Tanaka's faction, mounted a campaign against Takeshita to attempt to win over members of Tanaka's faction amid uncertainty as to his condition, which was only known to Tanaka's family and doctors. The division in the Tanaka faction was a boon for smaller LDP faction leaders, particularly Prime Minister Nakasone who no longer <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> a single dominant force within the LDP. Public chiding of Tanaka continued during 1985, including Sega's publication of an arcade game titled [...] featuring a caricature of Tanaka dodging various celebrities in a quest to collect gold bars and grow wealthy, with the title punning on the Japanese term for [...] "prime minister", Sōri (総理).|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the conquest}} of the old Republic in 1795, the war had not ended; the Netherlands had just changed sides and now fully participated in the {{continuing}} conflagration, but its role had changed. France did not need its army so much as its naval resources, in which France itself was deficient. In 1796, under the new alliance, the Dutch started a programme of naval construction. Manning the new ships was a problem, because the officer corps of the old navy was staunchly Orangist. People like the [...] "Hero of Doggerbank" [...] Jan Hendrik van Kinsbergen honourably withheld their services. The new navy was therefore officered by people like Jan Willem de Winter, who were of the correct political hue, but had only limited experience. This directly led to the debacles of the surrender at Saldanha Bay in 1796, and of the Battle of Camperdown in 1797. At Camperdown the Batavian navy behaved creditably, but this did not lessen the material losses, and the Republic had to start its naval construction programme all over again. This programme soon brought the Batavian navy up to sufficient strength that Great Britain <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> its potential contribution to a threatened French invasion of England or Ireland.|$|E
