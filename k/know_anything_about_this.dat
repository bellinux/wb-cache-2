D., Department of Mathematics Education Abstract: The {{aim of this}} Bachelor {{thesis is}} to create a {{historical}} introduction to the exciting card game and especially proximity of its mathematical aspects to the general public. The work consists of didactic way with many comments to the theory. The text is worded in a way that most people understand the situations, which are described without mathematical basics. For this reason there are no complicated formulas written and used are thoroughly described. The work focuses mainly on amateur poker players, but also on people, who <b>knows</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> card game.

60|$|Now, nobody <b>knew</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> old, old sword, {{but when}} the cathedral came to be examined--which was {{immediately}} done--there, sure enough, the sword was found! The Dauphin then required a number of grave priests and bishops to give him their opinion whether the girl derived her power from good spirits or from evil spirits, which they held prodigiously long debates about, {{in the course of}} which several learned men fell fast asleep and snored loudly. At last, when one gruff old gentleman had said to Joan, 'What language do your Voices speak?' and when Joan had replied to the gruff old gentleman, 'A pleasanter language than yours,' they agreed that it was all correct, and that Joan of Arc was inspired from Heaven. This wonderful circumstance put new heart into the Dauphin's soldiers when they heard of it, and dispirited the English army, who took Joan for a witch.|$|R

While this was going on, two of the hired help came up from the kitchen with pails and mops, and presently succeeded in cleaning up the floor. Two rugs which had been lying there were taken away to be dried.|$|E

"I may be back or I may not"--said Roswell, {{just then}} remembering Mary, and {{wondering}} if she would continue to keep him any longer in suspense, should he return successful from his present adventure--"That will depend on others more than on myself.

5000|$|Bran Castle (Castelul Bran; Törzburg; Törcsvár), {{situated}} near Bran and in {{the immediate}} vicinity of Braşov, is a national monument and landmark in Romania. The fortress is situated on the border between Transylvania and Wallachia, on DN73. Commonly known as [...] "Dracula's Castle" [...] (although it is one among several locations linked to the Dracula legend, including Poenari Castle and Hunyad Castle), it is often erroneously referred to as the home of the title character in Bram Stoker's Dracula. There is, however, no evidence that Stoker <b>knew</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> castle, which has only tangential associations with Vlad the Impaler, voivode of Wallachia, the putative inspiration for Dracula. As discovered by the Dutch author Hans Corneel de Roos, the location Bram Stoker actually had in mind for Castle Dracula while writing his novel was an empty mountain top, Mount Izvorul Călimanului, 2033 m high, located in the Călimani Alps near the former border with Moldavia. Stoker's description of Dracula's crumbling fictional castle also bears no resemblance to Bran Castle.|$|R
5000|$|With {{information}} about the mobile labs the Bush administration then went and asked Ahmed Chalabi's Iraqi National Congress (INC) if they <b>knew</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> [...] "threat". The INC provided an Iraqi defector, Mohammad Harith, who claimed that while working for the Iraqi government he had purchased seven Renault refrigerated trucks to be converted into mobile biological weapons laboratories. [...] The INC used James Woolsey, {{former director of the}} CIA, to directly contact Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary Linton Wells, of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), with info about Mohammad Harith's account to avoid any scrutiny by the CIA. [...] Harith's was met by a DIA debriefer who concluded that it [...] "seemed accurate, but much of it appeared embellished" [...] and he apparently [...] "had been coached on what information to provide." [...] However, the line about Harith being coached was removed and one that he passed a lie detector added and as such became official evidence of mobile bio-labs even being used by Bush in his January 2003 State of the Union message. [...] Later Mohammad Harith like curveball evidence was labeled with a fabricator notice.|$|R
60|$|Blue {{was a man}} of deeds {{rather than}} words, and so much strong speech from him, whom {{everybody}} knew to be remarkably reliable and keen, made a profound impression upon most of the Isbel faction. But, to Jean's surprise, his father did not rave. It was Blaisdell who supplied the rage and invective. Bill Isbel, also, was strangely indifferent to this new element in the condition of cattle dealing. Suddenly Jean caught a vague flash of thought, as if he had intercepted the thought of another's mind, and he wondered--could his brother Bill <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> crooked work alluded to by Blue? Dismissing the conjecture, Jean listened earnestly.|$|E

I laughed at him at first, for it seemed very absurd and I do {{not want him to}} love me. But then he proved to me there was some truth in his statement. He said his Lucy had a scar on her left arm, and that made me afraid, because I had {{discovered}} a scar on my own arm. I don't know how it got there. I don't <b>know</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> old Lucy. And I'm afraid to find out. I'm afraid of Lucy." ...|$|E

I did not want to learn sense or be done a world of good; I wanted to stay in Montreal and go on being foolish--and make up my quarrel with Mark Fenwick.

5000|$|In 1960 his String Quartet Number Two was premiered at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. by the Paganini Quartet, {{with the}} {{composer}} present, and broadcast on live FM radio. In the early 1960s {{he turned to}} free serial techniques, less sharply accented rhythms, and increasing fantasy [...] In his 1987 diaries, he wrote, [...] "Yesterday, I read about Elliott Carter's Double Concerto for piano and harpsichord. I find I am developing a type of chordal structure similar to his, but I never <b>knew</b> <b>anything</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> phase of his before reading about it. I certainly don't feel attracted to his rhythmic style, but the widespread open distribution of intervals in the chords & the cluster forms & inversions are very much what I have been doing. I hadn't, until lately, done anything {{to arrive at a}} new chordal style because of my predominant drive for linear motion, thematic or contrapuntal." [...] He wrote, in 1983, of his musical influences: [...] "The first music of a serious nature I was introduced to as a child was the 2- and 3-part inventions of Bach. Then Haydn and Chopin. All of these are simple and clear, and their harmonic content is not obscured by an elaborate overlay of either contrapuntal virtuosity or chromatic sugaring. After college I emerged with a fairly self-recognized set of preferences: Scarlatti, Soler, Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Berlioz, Debussy, Stravinsky—all those whose attitude toward the sonic portion of music is one of making things clear and strong-flavored." ...|$|R
