50|$|Nemesis is a {{hypothetical}} red dwarf or brown dwarf, originally postulated in 1984 to be orbiting the Sun {{at a distance}} of about 95,000 AU (1.5 light-years), somewhat beyond the Oort cloud, to explain a perceived cycle of mass extinctions in the geological record, which seem to occur more often at intervals of 26 million years. , over 1800 brown dwarfs have been identified. There are actually fewer brown dwarfs in our cosmic neighborhood than previously thought. Rather than one star for every brown dwarf, there may be as many as six stars for every brown dwarf. The majority of solar-type stars are single. The previous <b>idea</b> <b>stated</b> half or perhaps most stellar systems were binary, trinary, or multiple-star systems associated with clusters of stars, rather then the single-star systems that tend to be seen most often.|$|E

Emperor Taizong, rejecting the <b>idea,</b> <b>stated,</b> [...] "When it comes to the Prince of Wei, I would not even hesitate to cut my own flesh. However, the Crown Prince needs to be the son of the Son of Heaven. How can the Prince of Wei be Crown Prince?" [...] He then ordered that additional honors be considered for Zhao. At the suggestion of the imperial scholar Zhang Li (張礪), he gave Zhao the titles of defender of the central capital (i.e., Heng Prefecture (恆州, in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei)), and Grand Chancellor, in addition to continuing to have him be chief of staff. [...] Also around the same time, with his wife the Princess of Yan's having died in 942, he married her younger sister as his second wife.|$|E
5000|$|Although the Australian [...] {{ships were}} not {{originally}} planned to operate fixed-wing aircraft, in May 2014, the Minister for Defence David Johnston stated in media interviews {{that the government}} was considering acquiring F-35B fighters for Canberras, and Prime Minister Tony Abbott instructed 2015 Defence White Paper planners to consider the option of embarking F-35B squadrons aboard the two ships. Supporters of the <b>idea</b> <b>stated</b> that providing fixed-wing support to amphibious operations would maximize aircraft capability, and the presence of a ski-jump ramp, inherited from the original design, meant that the vessels were better suited to STOVL operations than equivalent ships with flat flight decks. Opponents to the idea countered that embarking enough F-35Bs to be effective required abandoning the ships' amphibious capability and would make the pseudo-carriers more valuable targets, modifications would be required to make the flight deck capable of handling vertical-landing thrust and to increase fuel and ordnance capacity for sustained operations, and that the F-35B project itself has been the most expensive and most problematic of the Joint Strike Fighter variants. In July 2015 Australia ended consideration of buying the F-35B for its two largest assault ships, as the ship modifications were projected to cost more than AUS$5 billion (US$4.4 billion). The plan was opposed by the Royal Australian Air Force, as an F-35B order could have diminished the number of F-35As purchased.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: {{typical of}} some {{contemporary}} theories of rationality is the pithily formulated <b>idea</b> <b>stated</b> almost 20 {{years ago by}} Gillian Rose (1947 - 1995) in her autobiography: «Reason, the critical criterion, is forever without ground». One important way of understanding this statement {{is found in the}} early writings of Karl R. Popper (1902 - 1994). This statement expresses the conviction at the root of Popper’s theory of rationality. This article begins with a brief presentation and analysis of Popper’s theory of rationality as it bears upon the question of violence. Afterwards, I turn to consider Ratzinger/Benedict XVI’s theory of rationality—as a response to Popper’s theory of rationality where critical reason is forever without ground. For Popper reason has its origin in the irrational, being as such, then, without grounds. Pace Popper, according to Ratzinger, reason has its origin in the Logos. In this connection, I lay out Ratzinger’s appeal to the ecumenical Christian philosophy of the Logos as the grounds of human reason. Wrapping up my presentation of Benedict’s view, I argue that he overcomes the dilemma of rationalism and irrationalism, especially in connection with the question of violenc...|$|E
40|$|Ideas of Rozansky and Witten, as {{developed}} by Kapranov, {{show that a}} complex symplectic manifold X gives rise to Vassiliev weight systems. In this paper we study these weight systems by using D(X), the derived category of coherent sheaves on X. The main <b>idea</b> (<b>stated</b> here a little imprecisely) is that D(X) is the category of modules over the shifted tangent sheaf, which is a Lie algebra object in D(X); the weight systems then arise from this Lie algebra in a standard way. The other main results are {{a description of the}} symmetric algebra, universal enveloping algebra, and Duflo isomorphism in this context, and the fact that a slight modification of D(X) has the structure of a braided ribbon category, which gives another way to look at the associated invariants of links. Our original motivation for this work was to try to gain insight into the Jacobi diagram algebras used in Vassiliev theory by looking at them in a new light, but there are other potential applications, in particular to the rigorous construction of the (1 + 1 + 1) -dimensional Rozansky-Witten TQFT, and to hyperkaehler geometry...|$|E
40|$|This paper explores value {{co-creation}} {{and value}} co-destruction {{with a focus}} on the social practices embedded in the online brand community “My Starbucks Idea (MSI). ” The objectives of the research are accomplished through a detailed explanation of the study’s stages, starting with the Research design/Planning, and followed by the Community Entry (Entrée), Data collection, Limitations, and Ethical implications. Since the study is exploratory in character, the qualitative research strategy was used. As Bryman and Bell (2011) note, qualitative research gives particular attention to words rather than numbers in the gathering and interpretation of data. This study applied a modified ‘netnographic’ approach, a new qualitative method devised specifically to investigate consumer behaviour vis-à-vis cultures and communities present on the Internet (Kozinets 1998). This study identifies three elements of practice: stalking, gossip, and exhibitionism. It also supports the <b>idea</b> <b>stated</b> by Echeverri & Skålén (2011) that there is no positive without a negative in interactive value formation. Although those authors’ work was focused on the provider-customer interface, the idea proves applicable to the online brand community (OBC) used for illustration in this study. The present study also draws attention to a vital characteristic of practice often forgotten: ‘Language’ as an enabler of all other elements (Whittington 2006). The paper contributes to the knowledge in the practice theory domain, and thus consumer culture, especially relating to OBCs. When using OBCs as a marketing tool, considerable ingenuity must be employed by business managers to gain strategic information and feedback from online forum discussions. Such information can help in the company’s strategic decision making. By building relationships and gaining new customers through the process of collaboration, managers can become more like brand storytellers. Also, such communication can be channelled as a means to create greater awareness, both of the brand and the users’ experiences, along with aiding in the development of better services and products to meet customers’ needs. In the current study, consent was an ethical concern that limited the scope and path taken by the paper. The ten-week research period was another limiting factor in properly covering all of the contextualized consumption activities and gaining sufficient experience within the MSI community...|$|E
