25|$|After {{the success}} of One Life to Live, a series Nixon created in 1968, ABC asked her to create another soap opera for them. She used the story bible <b>for</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Children to create the new program. The Erica {{character}} officially debuted in 1970 once All My Children made it onto the air.|$|E
25|$|On June 20, 2013, a {{deal was}} reached between Prospect Park and the Union, and taping will resume on August 12, 2013. On June 25, 2013, TOLN stated {{that there will}} be a {{scheduling}} switch <b>for</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Children and One Life to Live. Starting July 1, 2013, all episodes of the week for both shows would be released on Mondays.|$|E
25|$|On December 17, 2012, Deadline Hollywood {{reported}} that revival plans <b>for</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Children and One Life to Live had resurfaced. A few days later, it was {{reported that}} Prospect Park had secured studio place in Stamford, Connecticut, where both shows would be filmed. The show had been filmed in New York City from 1970 to 2010, and in Los Angeles from 2010 to 2011.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, Riegel {{returned}} for a short-term stint <b>for</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Children's 40th anniversary. The character had been cited as too iconic to recast, but, in 2010, Riegel decided to permanently exit the role, and plans to recast were subsequently confirmed. However, on February 22, 2013, {{it was announced that}} Riegel will be reprising her role as Bianca in guest-arc on the Prospect Park's continuation of All My Children.|$|E
25|$|Agnes Nixon, {{then head}} writer for The Guiding Light, first {{came up with}} the idea <b>for</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Children in the 1960s. When writing the story bible, she {{designed}} the show so it would be a light-hearted soap opera that focused on social issues and young love. She unsuccessfully attempted to sell the series to NBC, then to CBS, and once again to NBC through Procter & Gamble. When Procter & Gamble was unable to make room for the show in its lineup, Nixon put All My Children on hold.|$|E
25|$|Despite its fruitless {{attempt to}} save the series, Prospect Park had succeeded in {{retaining}} 13 actors to sign for the online venture, compared to only two actors <b>for</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Children. Matriarch actress Erika Slezak (Victoria Lord) was among the 13. The 12 other actors were Melissa Archer (Nathalie Buchanan), Kassie DePaiva (Blair Cramer), Michael Easton (John McBain), Shenell Edmonds (Destiny Evans), Josh Kelly (Cutter Wentworth), Ted King (Tomás Delgado), Florencia Lozano (Tea Delgado), Kelley Missal (Danielle Manning), Sean Ringgold (Shaun Evans), Andrew Trischitta (Jack Manning), Jerry Ver Dorn (Clint Buchanan) and Tuc Watkins (David Vickers).|$|E

25|$|Prospect Park {{initially}} intended <b>for</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Children {{to begin}} its {{run on the}} internet on September 26, 2011, but ran into challenges. One challenge cited in was a need to negotiate a new contract with the union representing the actors of All My Children. On September 27, 2011, Prospect Park announced that All My Children along with its sister soap One Life to Live would be relaunched in January 2012 on the company's new internet channel, The Online Network. But on November 10, 2011, several sources reported that Prospect Park had indefinitely suspended its plans to relaunch All My Children and that the company would concentrate solely on the higher-rated One Life to Live. Reasons given for this decision were lack of funding coupled with Prospect Park {{not being able to}} sign enough cast members from All My Children.|$|E
25|$|Erica and Dimitri {{were not}} {{originally}} scripted into a romantic pairing with each other. Erica Kane {{was created in}} the 1960s as one of the original characters in Agnes Nixon's story bible <b>for</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Children. Since the shows inception on January 5, 1970, Erica has had several love interests. It was not until twenty-one years after the soap opera began airing that she met Dimitri. The Dimitri Marick character was created in 1991 as a love interest for Natalie Marlowe. Even while he was engaged in a love triangle with Natalie and Trevor Dillon, there was speculation about a possible romance between Erica and Dimitri. These rumors were neither confirmed nor denied by Nixon. She did, however, confirm that Dimitri's story would eventually include Erica. At first the involvement was limited to each character's story being effected by the same catalysts and Erica commenting on Dimitri's relationship with Natalie.|$|E
500|$|The romance between Dimitri and Finola Hughes' Alexandra Devane Marick also rose in popularity. Soap Opera Update named {{them the}} best couple {{of the year in}} 1999 <b>for</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Children despite the fact that their love story played out through brief flashbacks. The {{magazine}} compared the couple's relationship to the television series Once and Again. Soap Opera Update also referred to them as the [...] "break out supercouple of the year".|$|E

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 2006, Bonnie Miller Rubin of the Chicago Tribune {{described}} TransGeneration as a pop-culture vehicle that [...] "helped trans issues gain more visibility". The show inspired writer/actor Megan McTavish to create a transgender character <b>for</b> <b>All</b> <b>My</b> Children, a US soap opera for which she was the head writer. [...] "I found [...] experiences so moving that I started thinking along those lines," [...] she said. The character she created, Zoe, was introduced in 2006, and was played by Jeffrey Carlson.|$|E
500|$|Henry kept {{in touch}} with his younger brother Edgar {{sporadically}} as they grew up, often through letters but once he even visited Edgar in Richmond in the 1820s. There, Edgar introduced his brother to his childhood sweetheart, Sarah Elmira Royster. Edgar's foster-father John Allan also corresponded with Henry. In one letter, dated November 1, 1824, Allan apologized that Edgar was slow in writing a letter to Henry, complaining that his foster-son [...] "had little else to do, for he does nothing... The boy possesses not a Spark of affection for us, not a particle of gratitude <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> care and kindness towards him." ...|$|E

[...] Bieber explained on his Twitter that [...] his fans [...] "took him from a small town in Canada" [...] to the [...] "amazing opportunity" [...] he is living now, and feels [...] "grateful for everything" [...] and [...] "blessed" [...] for the support. Bieber confirmed he co-wrote the track with August Rigo. He also told his fans to enjoy it as they are the ones who give him his strength in this.|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} 1898 Dresser {{reported}} that nearly one million copies of sheet music would soon be sold, making [...] "Wabash" [...] a [...] "sensation", the [...] "great hit of the day." [...] In a newspaper interview Dresser said, [...] "I can’t tell you just how much I have cleared off of the song, but the $50,000 estimate I have seen in some papers is very modest. You see I am a publisher {{as well as a}} composer and have a big printing house of my own in New York. I also write the words <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> songs, dictate the circumstances and stage settings for their public introductions, write my own ads, and sometimes sing my own songs. Now {{what do you think of}} that for a monopoly. Eh?" [...] Dresser earned a substantial income from the song, including royalties through the sale of sheet music.|$|E
500|$|A {{controversy}} arose {{over the}} writing credits on [...] "Irreplaceable". Ne-Yo told MTV: [...] "Apparently Beyoncé {{was at a}} show somewhere and right before the song came on she said, 'I wrote this <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> ladies' and then the song came on...The song is a co-write. I wrote the lyrics, I wrote all the lyrics. Beyoncé helped me with the melodies and the harmonies and the vocal arrangement {{and that makes it}} a co-write. Meaning my contribution and her contribution made that song what it is." [...] In 2011, Ne-Yo said that he wrote the song for himself, but thought {{that it would be better}} suited for Beyoncé, and later regretted giving the song to her. Some of Beyoncé's fans read Ne-Yo's remark as disrespectful towards her. However, he clarified his comment later through Twitter, writing, [...] "I said I originally wrote the song for me....Once I realized how the song comes across if sung by a guy, that's when I decided to give it away." ...|$|E
500|$|The song, {{which was}} the last one written for the album, was placed {{at the end of the}} album because it [...] "marks a new beginning" [...] for the band, {{which was the}} theme on the album and a theme in Lee's life. In the booklet of The Open Door, she stated that her long-time friend and husband, Josh Hartzler, was the main {{inspiration}} for the song. In the booklet she wrote, [...] "Josh, you are my muse. Nothing inspires me the way you do. Thank you <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> missing pieces. Thank you for your strength and love. Thank you for letting me see myself through your eyes, because only then could I know that I am good enough for you." [...] One of the band's previous singles, [...] "Bring Me to Life", was also written about Josh Hartzler. In an interview with VH1, Lee further revealed the inspiration behind the song, saying [...] "I had gone through a lot of difficult things during the writing of the whole album, and by the end of it, I had stepped away from those bad situations. That's really hard. You have to be really brave and strong about it. After doing that, I felt so amazing. For the first time I felt like I could write a song based on how good I felt. I have never done that before ever. During another interview with The Washington Post she stated: ...|$|E

500|$|The A.V. Club's Noel Murray {{had a more}} mixed reaction, {{giving the}} episode a rating of C+ and criticizing lead guest actor Cameron Monaghan, [...] "In this role, he was a drag, playing 'rebellious teen' in a stock, wooden way, with no extra layers. Also, nobody—not even Joshua Jackson, whom I've come to {{appreciate}} more as an actor over the run of this show—could make the 'My mind is being controlled!' scenes look anything other than goofy." [...] Murray also said, [...] "Yet <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> griping, I was quite taken with {{the theme of this}} episode, and the motifs that writers Robert Chiappetta and Glen Whitman and director Joe Chappelle used to support it. From the tinfoil Peter Pan hats that Walter and Astrid wear to Tyler popping the medication that grants him his powers out of a Pez dispenser, there's a lot in 'Of Human Action' about childish things." [...] Ramsey Isler from IGN graded the episode 8.0/10, explaining that despite it being a [...] "standalone" [...] episode, it was [...] "a high-intensity, action-filled tale that kept the adrenaline flowing. Fringe is usually more of a cerebral show, but there's nothing wrong with appealing to our love of action every now and then". Also positive was Chanel Reeder of Newsarama, who believed Fringe [...] "totally deliver in its most recent episode. The twists are back, along with the dramatic high intensity moments that the show is known for." [...] Reeder praised the plot twist of Tyler being the mind controller, and was pleased with the increased presence of Massive Dynamic.|$|E
500|$|An ode to oral sex, [...] "Blow" [...] {{stands in}} line with the {{explicit}} theme of the album about frank female sexuality and eroticism. Lyrically, it refers to cunnilingus through heavy innuendos omitting subtlety; the lines [...] "Can you lick my Skittles, it's the sweetest in the middle/ Pink is the flavor, solve the riddle" [...] are sung [...] "flirtatiously" [...] by Beyoncé. It opens with a breathy atmosphere and Beyoncé singing the lines, [...] "I kiss you and you lick your lips/ You like it wet and so do I/ I know you never waste a drip/ I wonder how it feels sometimes". The chorus lines are [...] "pleaded" [...] by the singer as stated by Fallon: [...] "Keep me coming, keep me going, keep me humming, keep me moaning". The second half of the song contains a tempo change with a funkier beat and the singer singing verse-chorus-verse trajectories. Chris Richards of The Washington Post compared this type of songcraft with Maxwell, Erykah Badu and Frank Ocean's work. It starts with Beyoncé declaring [...] "I'm about to get into this girls. This <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> grown women out there". During this part, Timbaland's vocals can be heard in the background as part of a call and response. It follows with Beyoncé singing the lines [...] "I can't wait 'til I get home so you can turn that cherry out" [...] to her man; according to Caitlin White of the website The 405, these line [...] "exhibit deep assurance of her usual freedom". During the second part, the lines [...] "turn that cherry out" [...] are repeatedly sung followed by the lyrics [...] "I'm-a let you be the boss of me". She finishes the second part by delivering, [...] "Don't slip off when it drip off on top of you... Gimme that daddy-long stroke". The second part was further described as a [...] "masterful recreation of mid-'80s First Avenue funk". At the end [...] "Blow" [...] features a French-language interlude.|$|E
500|$|He {{received}} {{interest from}} Micky Adams' Port Vale, {{and joined the}} club on trial in July 2010. Acknowledging [...] "it's a last-chance saloon", Roberts said [...] "I've learnt just {{not to be a}} plonker <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>my</b> life." [...] He joined the team on their July pre-season trip to Ireland, as Adams, already convinced of the player's talents, wanted to test Roberts' ability to stay away from his off-the-field demons. Roberts seemed to enjoy a good start to his Vale career, and after Adams' typically relentless pre-season fitness regime he claimed [...] "I've turned the corner...I think I've got my act together but I've just got to keep living each day as it comes and as long as I wake up clean that's all that I need". He signed a six-month contract {{at the end of the}} month. He started the season well, maintaining discipline off the pitch, and his first team place on it, forging a midfield partnership with Anthony Griffith. As early as September he entered negotiations with the club to extend his contract, and Roberts quickly signed an extended contract to keep him at the club until the end of the season. However Micky Adams left the club in December 2010, and Roberts did not enjoy a happy relationship with new manager Jim Gannon. Gannon dropped him to the bench after Roberts admitted he did not enjoy playing in a more advanced position; Vale fans showed their support for the player by chanting his name throughout a 1–0 win over Rotherham. He then picked up a three-match ban after receiving a red card for violent conduct in a reserve match against Nottingham Forest. Gannon defended Roberts, believing the player was unlucky to be dismissed after he responded to a 'reckless' challenge by David Morgan by shoving Morgan to the ground. In March, speculation that he would leave Vale Park at the end of the season (or earlier) increased, as it was reported by BBC Radio Stoke that the club had informed the player he could leave on loan. However Gannon denied this on the club's website, stating that there was [...] "no substance" [...] to the report. In fact he went on to say [...] "he has a huge part to play" [...] in the club's promotion campaign. His teammates also showed their support for him by celebrating goals with Roberts' celebration style during his absence; club captain Marc Richards also dedicated his two goals against Shrewsbury Town to Roberts. Gannon's reign was quickly terminated, but Roberts still struggled to regain his form under caretaker-manager Mark Grew.|$|E
