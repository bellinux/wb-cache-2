The {{interior of the}} <b>keys</b> <b>are</b> frequented by warblers and the hawks that prey on them. Coastal zones are habitat for ruddy turnstones and least sandpipers. Gulls and terns include royal terns, laughing gulls and ring-billed gulls, with brown pelicans just offshore. Wilson's plovers nest on Boca Chita Key, where nesting zones are closed during breeding season.|$|E

5|$|Saint Peter was {{represented}} holding keys {{as early as}} the fifth century. As the Roman Catholic Church considers him the first pope and bishop of Rome, the keys were adopted as a papal emblem; they first appear with papal arms in the 13th century. Two keys perpendicular were often used on coins, but beginning in the 15th century were used to represent St. Peter's Basilica. Perpendicular keys last appeared in the shield of the papacy in 1555, after which the crossed <b>keys</b> <b>are</b> used exclusively. The <b>keys</b> <b>are</b> gold and silver, with the gold key placed to dexter (viewer's left) on the personal arms of the Pope, although two silver keys or two gold keys were used late into the 16th century. The keys as a symbol of Saint Peter may be found within many coats of arms; the coat of arms of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen displayed two argent (silver) crossed keys as Saint Peter is the patron saint of the Bremian archiepiscopal cathedral.|$|E
5|$|The AACS Licensing Authority (LA) assigns {{a series}} of 253 unique {{cryptographic}} keys to device manufacturers. When an AACS protected disc is manufactured, {{a series of}} up to 64 keys called title <b>keys</b> <b>are</b> generated and the video content on the disc is encrypted using these keys. The title <b>keys</b> <b>are</b> stored on the disc and themselves encrypted with another key called the volume unique key. The volume unique key for any disc can be calculated by all authorized devices using another key called a processing key, which is derived from a media key block stored on each disc. Authorized devices use {{one or more of}} the manufacturer's assigned device keys to decrypt the media key block, yielding a processing key and enabling further decryption of the volume and title keys, and finally the content.|$|E
5|$|All {{communication}} from mobile terminals {{to the base}} stations is encrypted with a key known only to the base station and the terminal. For group conversations, two <b>keys</b> <b>are</b> used, one from the terminal to the base station, and one from the base station to all users. In addition, there are 32 fixed keys used for terminal-to-terminal communication should the base station fall out. In addition, the police can use a user-to-user encryption where the communication is encrypted {{all the way through}} the network from the one user to the other.|$|E

5|$|Clock Tower is a point-and-click {{adventure}} {{game with}} 3D graphics. The player may use a PlayStation controller or mouse {{to move the}} cursor on the screen. The cursor will change shape when placed over certain objects, which the player can click to interact with. Clicking in any location will guide the player character in that direction. Moving the cursor {{to the top of}} the screen will reveal the player's inventory. Clicking an item and then clicking an object on the screen will use the item on that object or in that location. Some items such as <b>keys</b> <b>are</b> used automatically when clicked.|$|E
5|$|In {{computer}} science, integer sorting is the algorithmic {{problem of}} sorting {{a collection of}} data values by numeric keys, {{each of which is}} an integer. Algorithms designed for integer sorting may also often be applied to sorting problems in which the <b>keys</b> <b>are</b> floating point numbers, rational numbers, or text strings. The ability to perform integer arithmetic on the keys allows integer sorting algorithms to be faster than comparison sorting algorithms in many cases, depending on the details of which operations are allowed in the model of computing and how large the integers to be sorted are.|$|E
5|$|Once an {{alternate}} boot partition has been created, the TPM module {{needs to be}} initialized (assuming that this feature is being used), after which the required disk encryption key protection mechanisms such as TPM, PIN or USB key are configured. The volume is then encrypted as a background task, something that may take {{a considerable amount of}} time with a large disk as every logical sector is read, encrypted and rewritten back to disk. The <b>keys</b> <b>are</b> only protected after the whole volume has been encrypted, when the volume is considered secure. BitLocker uses a low-level device driver to encrypt and decrypt all file operations, making interaction with the encrypted volume transparent to applications running on the platform.|$|E

5|$|Reaction to {{the utility}} by Doom9 forum members, bloggers, and {{mainstream}} media has ranged from supportive to intensely hostile. By some, the circumvention of AACS {{was seen as}} a reaffirmation of fair use. Others felt that the utility {{was no more than a}} piracy tool and would bring about group punishment against consumers in the form of player revocation. One article compared proponents of BackupHDDVD to terrorists. When the release of the tool was first publicized, several articles claimed that AACS had been cracked. In fact no cryptographic weaknesses constituting a crack have yet been found in AES, the underlying cryptographic system of AACS. <b>Keys</b> <b>are</b> actually obtained through a side-channel attack.|$|E
5|$|Biscayne National Park protects four {{distinct}} ecosystems: {{the shoreline}} mangrove swamp, the shallow waters of Biscayne Bay, the coral limestone keys and the offshore Florida Reef. The shoreline swamps {{of the mainland}} and island margins provide a nursery for larval and juvenile fish, molluscs and crustaceans. The bay waters harbor immature and adult fish, seagrass beds, sponges, soft corals, and manatees. The <b>keys</b> <b>are</b> covered with tropical vegetation including endangered cacti and palms, and their beaches provide nesting grounds for endangered sea turtles. Offshore reefs and waters harbor more than 200 species of fish, pelagic birds, whales and hard corals. Sixteen endangered species including Schaus' swallowtail butterflies, smalltooth sawfish, manatees, and green and hawksbill sea turtles may be observed in the park. Biscayne also has a small population of threatened American crocodiles and a few American alligators.|$|E
5|$|During the event, a Warlord infiltrates Camelot and poisons Squire Everett. The party {{collects}} {{an antidote}} in the Swamp of Zagar and saves the Squire. They then claim the fourth Key of Truth in Stone Keep. They rescue {{the son of}} the Gnome King to obtain the fifth Key of Truth, and collects four Elemental Keys to unlock access to Castle Vilor and the sixth Key of Truth. The party finds the seventh and eighth Keys of Truth in Crownhorn village and the Cape of Death, respectively. The ninth and tenth <b>Keys</b> <b>are</b> found in Blackroot Keep and the Dark Citadel while searching for the missing pieces of the Staff of Rhiothamus, which can break open a path in Hadrian's Wall.|$|E
50|$|The search {{algorithm}} for skip graphs {{is almost}} identical to the search algorithm for skip lists but it is modified to run in a distributed system. Searches start at the top level and traverse through the structure. At each level, the search traverses the list until the next node contains a greater key. When a greater <b>key</b> <b>is</b> found, the search drops to the next level, continuing until the <b>key</b> <b>is</b> found or it is determined that the <b>key</b> <b>is</b> not contained in the set of nodes. If the <b>key</b> <b>is</b> not contained in the set of nodes the largest value less than the search <b>key</b> <b>is</b> returned.|$|R
5000|$|We {{begin by}} {{examining}} the root node. If the tree <b>is</b> null, the <b>key</b> we <b>are</b> searching for {{does not exist in}} the tree. Otherwise, if the key equals that of the root, the search is successful and we return the node. If the <b>key</b> <b>is</b> less than that of the root, we search the left subtree. Similarly, if the <b>key</b> <b>is</b> greater than that of the root, we search the right subtree. This process is repeated until the <b>key</b> <b>is</b> found or the remaining subtree is null. If the searched <b>key</b> <b>is</b> not found after a null subtree is reached, then the <b>key</b> <b>is</b> not present in the tree. This is easily expressed as a recursive algorithm (implemented in Python): ...|$|R

5|$|The HTC One uses a unibody {{aluminum}} frame sourced from custom-grade aluminum; {{the choice of}} material was intended to give the device a solid, premium feel in comparison to smartphones made with a plastic shell. The frame is etched with channels in which the polycarbonate is inset using zero-gap injection molding. The polycarbonate forms a band {{around the edge of}} the device, covers the top and bottom ends, and bisects the back with two lines, one of which flows around the camera below. The two polycarbonate bands across the back are used to insulate its antennas, while the ring around the camera is used as a loop antenna for the One's near field communication (NFC) functionality. Alongside its display are two aluminum endpieces with a tight grid of laser-cut holes forming the speaker grilles behind which sit two stereo sound speakers; the metal volume <b>keys</b> <b>are</b> smoothly inlaid on the left side of the frame. The unibody frame itself takes at least 200 minutes of precision CNC cutting to machine, and the final result is a solid slate of anodized aluminum, white polycarbonate, and tempered glass with chamfered, polished edges.|$|E
5|$|The Steam store also enables {{users to}} redeem store product keys to add {{software}} from their library. The <b>keys</b> <b>are</b> sold by third-party providers such as Humble Bundle (in which {{a portion of}} the sale is given back to the publisher or distributor), distributed as part of a physical release to redeem the game, or given to a user as part of promotions, often used to deliver Kickstarter and other crowd funding rewards. A grey market exists around Steam keys, where less reputable buyers purchase a large number of Steam keys for a game when it is offered for a low cost, and then resell these keys to users or other third-party sites at a higher price, generating profit for themselves. This caused some of these third-party sites, like G2A, to be embroiled in this grey market. It is possible for publishers to have Valve to track down where specific keys have been used and cancel them, removing the product from the user's libraries, leaving the user to seek any recourse with the third-party they purchased from. Other legitimate storefronts, like Humble Bundle, have set a minimum price that must be spent to obtain Steam keys as to discourage mass purchases that would enter the grey market.|$|E
5|$|The {{smartphone}} considerably reduces its predecessor's sizes, measuring 4.3 by 2.4 by 6 inches (10.92, 6.09 and 15.24 centimeters, respectively). The Bold 9700 has a 624MHz {{processor and}} a 256MB Flash memory. The device uses a 2.44 inch HVGA (approximately 6.1cm) non-touch LCD display at {{a resolution of}} 480×360 pixels. The resolution of the display was {{compared to that of}} HTC Magic, as it has also HVGA quality. The model changes its predecessor's trackball to an optical trackpad, with simple functionalities such as swiping the thumb to move it and press it to make a selection. This change prevented problems including the accumulation of dust behind the trackball. Similarly to previous BlackBerry models, BlackBerry 9700 has a 35-key QWERTY-type physical keyboard, which is smaller than that of Bold 9000. On the top of the device, there are two buttons that respectively lock or mute it; {{on the right side of}} it, rubberized <b>keys</b> <b>are</b> found, which can either control the audio volume or the music player; further down, there is a camera shutter key. Cosmetic changes including the addition of a leatherette battery cover were carried out in order to appeal both sexes.|$|E
