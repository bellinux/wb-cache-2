Since such self-excited <b>ionization</b> <b>waves</b> {{are determined by the}} ionization processes in the discharge, they are inherently nonlinear and a variety of nonlinear effects may be observed. After reviewing the theory and experimental observations for small amplitude linear <b>ionization</b> <b>waves</b> in gas discharges, experimental data obtained from an argon discharge, 5 cm in diameter, 110 cms in length, run at gas pressures between 0. 1 - 1. 5 torr and discharge currents of 20 - 250 mA, are presented. Linear interactions between large amplitude self-excited waves of the same frequency, and nonlinear mode coupling between waves of different frequencies and wave numbers are reported and the characteristics of each wave type are described. In order to interpret some of the phenomena observed for the self-excited waves, experiments where an external alternating voltage was applied across the discharge were performed. Following a general discussion of wave modulation the wave-wave mode coupling is interpreted as due to nonlinear interactions which may arise during the initial nonlinear growth of <b>ionization</b> <b>waves.</b> A physical model for the nonlinear behaviour is described.

40|$|This review {{focuses on}} one of the {{fundamental}} phenomena that occur upon application of sufficiently strong electric fields to gases, namely the formation and propagation of ionization waves-streamers. The dynamics of streamers is controlled by strongly nonlinear coupling, in localized streamer tip regions, between enhanced (due to charge separation) electric field and ionization and transport of charged species in the enhanced field. Streamers appear in nature (as initial stages of sparks and lightning, as huge structures-sprites above thunderclouds), and are also found in numerous technological applications of electrical discharges. Here we discuss the fundamental physics of the guided streamer-like structures-plasma bullets which are produced in cold atmospheric-pressure plasma jets. Plasma bullets are guided <b>ionization</b> <b>waves</b> moving in a thin column of a jet of plasma forming gases (e. g.,He or Ar) expanding into ambient air. In contrast to streamers in a free (unbounded) space that propagate in a stochastic manner and often branch, guided <b>ionization</b> <b>waves</b> are repetitive and highly-reproducible and propagate along the same path-the jet axis. This property of guided streamers, in comparison with streamers in a free space, enables many advanced time-resolved experimental studies of <b>ionization</b> <b>waves</b> with nanosecond precision. In particular, experimental studies on manipulation of streamers by external electric fields and streamer interactions are critically examined. This review also introduces the basic theories and recent advances on the experimental and computational studies of guided streamers, in particular related to the propagation dynamics of <b>ionization</b> <b>waves</b> and the various parameters of relevance to plasma streamers. This knowledge is very useful to optimize the efficacy of applications of plasma streamer discharges in various fields ranging from health care and medicine to materials science and nanotechnology...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – The {{initiation}} and {{the development}} of a breakdown of highly overvoltaged gas gaps by voltage pulses having the rise time of 1 ns or shorter are studied experimentally and in theoreti-cal terms. The study revealed that ionization proc-esses leading to the breakdown start in the gas vol-ume and not from the surface of the electrodes. The gap flashover is followed by ionization wave processes initiating in the gas volume and playing the decisive role at the first phase of the break-down. The dynamics of the <b>ionization</b> <b>waves</b> strongly depends on the initial distribution of free electrons over the gas gap. The distribution of ioni-zation waves is analyzed when the initial electrons are distributed nonuniformly over the gap. It is shown that their nonuniform distribution initiates the simultaneous propagation of cathode- and an-ode-oriented <b>ionization</b> <b>waves.</b> These waves cause a redistribution of the electrical field in the gas gap and a region of a strong field, whose intensity is sufficient for the onset of emission processes and the generation of a short beam of fast electrons near the cathode, is formed at the cathode for a very short (up to 100 ps) time. 1...|$|E
