5|$|The VP {{update of}} 1991 {{featured}} cosmetic changes and mechanical however most were not visible {{unless you were}} to pull the motor down; and a very similar revised 3.8-litre V6 and 5.0-litre V8 engines from the VN were carried over. The 2.0-litre straight-four engine previously available in New Zealand was discontinued. Exterior cosmetic changes included a translucent acrylic <b>grille</b> on the base level Executive and Berlina, with a colour-coded <b>grille</b> for the S and SS, and a chrome <b>grille</b> for Calais. Updated tail lights and boot garnishes were {{also a part of}} the changes, which were different for each model, with the Berlina having grey stripes and the Calais chrome stripes. Semi-trailing arm independent rear suspension became standard on the Calais and SS, but was made an option on lower-end models in lieu of the live rear axle, improving ride and handling.|$|E
5|$|A new wider {{front track}} was {{introduced}} to address issues with the previous carried-over VL chassis components. In August 1992, anti-lock brakes were introduced as an option on the Calais and SS trim levels, later becoming optional on all Series II variants. This January 1993 update also included a colour-coded <b>grille</b> for the Executive and alloy wheels for the Commodore S.|$|E

50|$|Cars with rear engines, {{such as the}} Volkswagen Beetle and {{the early}} Porsches, {{necessarily}} have no radiator <b>grilles</b> in front, and so have horn <b>grilles</b> placed below their headlights. Some motor scooters have this feature as well, placed below the handlebars. Their horn <b>grilles</b> may be made of cheap plastic. These vehicles and the cheaper cars have only one horn.|$|R
50|$|<b>Grilles</b> {{took on a}} {{new look}} after World War II. Following the {{introduction}} of the 1947 Buick, Studebaker, and Kaiser, <b>grilles</b> became shorter and wider to accommodate for the change in design.|$|R
5000|$|Ford Vanette, Ford MTO-71 or Ford FFV {{was made}} between 1948 and 1970. It succeeded the Walk-In {{versions}} of the Ford F-Series trucks, and had the same <b>grilles</b> of the Ford F-Series from 1951-1955. After 1956, it retained the 1955 <b>grilles</b> until the model was discontinued and replaced with the Ford P-Series chassis. These models were stripped-chassis that could be fitted with made-to-order bodies, and often contained red crests on the <b>grilles</b> reading [...] "Chassis By FORD." ...|$|R
5|$|A mentally {{unbalanced}} Ricky Williams (David Baxt) {{is driven}} to re-enter the caves when {{a sample of}} crystals pulsates and the chemical intelligence exerts its influence through a mark on his arm. Thrown into a <b>grille</b> in a compromised environmental suit, Gail (Rosalind Lloyd) removes her helmet and freezes {{to death in the}} toxic atmosphere while trying to amputate her trapped foot with a chainsaw. Documentation officer Kate Frost (Stephanie Beacham) shoots Ricky with a harpoon gun before he opens both the inner and outer airlock doors and renders the air inside the base unbreathable.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 11 {{companies}} were ever granted licenses by the BBC to manufacture the model, {{a maximum of}} 3 at any given time. The product proved highly challenging to manufacture, {{if for no other}} reason than tight specifications and consistency of parts, and many of these companies would have a chequered corporate history. Audible differences could result from the mounting screws, <b>grille</b> fabric, or the origin of the wool.|$|E
5|$|After the two-car draft style {{dominated}} the 2011Budweiser Shootout, NASCAR reduced the front <b>grille</b> opening to 50square inches and the overflow valve for the cooling {{system would be}} supplied by NASCAR and set at 33pounds per square inch. Also, high speeds in the race caused NASCAR {{to reduce the size}} of the restrictor plate by 1/64-inch, with the expectations of cutting 10horsepower from the engines.|$|E

5|$|Kieswetter's {{career was}} cut short owing to an injury {{sustained}} while batting for Somerset in July 2014: a ball penetrated the gap between his helmet's <b>grille</b> and visor and struck him in the face, damaging his vision. There was initially some hope of a full recovery and he was named in a provisional England squad for the 2015 Cricket World Cup, but he continued to experience difficulties with his vision. As {{a result of these}} problems, in June 2015, aged 27, he announced his retirement from professional cricket. In 2017, he became a professional golfer.|$|E
5|$|MY09: {{models were}} {{launched}} on 15 March 2008. Six airbags were made standard across the rangeâ€”Omega and SV6 variants were previously fitted with two and four airbags respectively. Omega models also received standard fitment of air conditioning, 16-inch alloy wheels, body colour wing mirrors and door handles, {{and a new}} <b>grille</b> insert with chrome highlights. Revised alloy wheel designs were featured on the Calais (seven-spoke) and Calais V (10-spoke).|$|E
5|$|On 23 November 1984, during {{renovation}} works, {{the station}} suffered a severe fire which burned out the northbound Victoria line platform. It {{is believed that}} the fire was caused by smoking materials being pushed through a ventilation <b>grille</b> into a storeroom where they set several materials on fire. This caused the Victoria line between Warren Street and Victoria to be suspended until 18 December the same year. This incident also led to a smoking ban being introduced on trains in July 1984.|$|E

5|$|Toyota also {{manufactures}} {{and markets}} the Aurion {{in parts of}} East and Southeast Asia, where it is marketed under the Toyota Camry branding. This model gets a redesigned <b>grille</b> and is marketed under different trim levels to their Australasian counterparts. Although these vary from country to country, the range consists of the following models in some markets: 2.0 E, 2.0 G, 2.4 E, 2.4 G, 2.4 Sportivo, 2.4 V, 3.5 V, and 3.5 Q. The decimal in the nomenclature denotes the engine displacement, with the letter representing the level of luxury.|$|E
5|$|International: sedans and Sportwagons entered {{production}} in mid-March 2009. Internationals are appointed with launch VE Calais V alloy wheels, front foglamps, a six-disc CD changer, leather upholstered trim and steering wheel, Bluetooth connectivity and rear park assist. Holden reintroduced the International in October 2009. Offered in sedan and Sportwagon body styles, the second iteration was fitted with the 3.0-litre SIDI V6 engine and six-speed automatic transmission; a 3.6-litre LPG Alloytec V6 engine with four-speed automatic transmission option {{was available for}} the sedan only. Extra features include 18-inch alloy wheels, Berlina front <b>grille,</b> leather seat trim and steering wheel, Bluetooth connectivity and rear park assist for the sedan (already standard on Sportwagons).|$|E
5|$|Marking a {{high point}} in terms of sales, the last-of-the-series VL Commodore sold in record numbers, finally {{managing}} to outsell the Ford Falcon in the private sector. The 1986 VL represented a substantial makeover of the VK and {{would be the last}} of the mid-size Commodores. Designers distanced the Commodore further away from its Opel origins, by smoothing the lines of the outer body and incorporating a subtle tail spoiler. A thorough redesign of the nose saw the Commodore gain sleek, narrow headlamps and a shallower <b>grille,</b> while the Calais specification employed unique partially concealed headlamps.|$|E
40|$|Good {{ventilation}} {{system in a}} bus passenger compartment is important for providing clean, healthy air and comfortable micro-environment for passengers. Lack of fresh air inside the bus compartment could increase the contaminant concentration level and affect the passenger's health. This research presents field measurement on contaminant concentration level of particulate matter and carbon monoxide inside the passenger compartment of a university's shuttle bus. The field measurements were conducted at the front, middle and rear locations of the passenger compartment. Computational fluid dynamics software was used to develop a simplified three-dimensional model of the bus passenger compartment. Two cases of air return <b>grilles</b> location namely three air return <b>grilles</b> and four air return <b>grilles</b> were performed. The results show that four air return <b>grilles</b> could reduce the contaminant concentration levels of CO and PM 1 inside the bus passenger compartment...|$|R

5|$|The Fairmont model {{opened up}} the luxury sector for the BA range. Externally, the Fairmont could be {{distinguished}} from the other BA models with its 16-inch alloy wheels and grey mesh <b>grille</b> with chrome surround. Some of the standard features included traction control and dual-zone climate control air conditioning, an analogue clock on the top centre console stack, wood grain highlights, and velour upholstery. Automatic headlights, which turn off or on depending on surrounding environmental conditions, were now standard on the Fairmont model. In addition to this, the Fairmont also received illuminated footwells. The basic mechanical setup carried over from the XT, although buyers could opt for the Barra 220 V8 engine.|$|E
5|$|In May 1985, {{designers}} {{started work}} on the F1 project. In late 1985, designers presented the first exterior study models to F1 management, featuring a sports car-like design with a low-slung hood and narrow front profile. By 1986, the sedan used a three-box design with an upright stance, more prominent <b>grille,</b> and a two-tone body. Extensive modeling and wind tunnel tests resulted in a low drag coefficient for a conventional production vehicle of the time (C'd 0.29). For the passenger cabin, the materials-selection tests evaluated 24 different kinds of wood and multiple types of leather {{for two years before}} settling on specific trim combinations. By 1986, the Lexus marque was created to support the launch of the flagship sedan, and the vehicle became known as the Lexus LS. Following eight design reviews, subsequent revisions, concept approval in September 1986, and over US$1 billion in development expenses, the final design for the production Lexus LS 400 (chassis code UCF10) was frozen in May 1987 with design patents filed on 13 May 1987.|$|E
5|$|Later in the 1960s {{and into}} the 1970s, locally {{prominent}} bands gradually changed from primarily cover bands to more well rounded groups, while the city's musical opportunities grew with the foundation of venues and institutions. This period {{has been called the}} Normaltown River of Music, and included long-time local performers like Mad Dog Melton as well as Brian Burke, Davis Causey and Randall Bramblett, many of whom later worked with Gregg Allman and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. The most influential local bands to emerge from this period included the Normaltown Flyers, and Dixie Grease. The oldest bar featuring live music in Athens is Allen's Hamburgers where the Normaltown Flyers were the house band for many years. Allen's opened in 1955 on Prince Avenue, closed for a brief time, and has since reopened on Hawthorne Ave. as part of a restoration project. Bars like The Last Resort (currently the Last Resort <b>Grille</b> restaurant) opened in the 1960s, beginning the local club scene just as some bands were beginning to gain some regional fame for Athens.|$|E
