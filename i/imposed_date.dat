However, many gift vouchers are lost or forgotten and expire unused – resulting in enormous profits to the retailers and corresponding losses to consumers. Many Canadian provinces and US States have enacted legislation prohibiting retailers from <b>imposing</b> expiry <b>dates</b> on gift vouchers. This article argues that it is unjust for retailers to accept consideration for gift vouchers and then refuse to deliver promised goods or services when the vouchers expire. It recommends amendments to Australian consumer protection laws along the lines of Canadian and US reforms to protect consumers from losing the benefit of unused and expired gift vouchers...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{complexities}} of solving PDEs, a general assumption regarding real options is to discard time-dependency. Nevertheless, this assumption is not necessarily realistic, considering that people tend to simplify problems by self <b>imposing</b> maturity <b>dates.</b> To study this phenomenon, {{the value of a}} compounded American option is compared considering two different exercise rules, using either (1) fixed dates under which a decision must be made, or (2) establishing a fixed lead time after an option exercise where an investor cannot exercise its claim over the asset. These values are then computed using numerical methods, in order to calculate under which circumstances it is worthwhile to establish limited timeframes to Behavioral economists have long recognized the fact that people do not always act as predicted by economic theory.

40|$|The European {{integration}} {{process has been}} accompanied by an increasing openness to trade within Europe. Boosting trade within Europe is a longstanding concern of the EU. Economic literature has paid attention to estimate the effect of single integration steps and has focused mainly on the Euro effect. A priori, it is not clear which event had most crucially affected trade patterns in Europe. We analyze which of the major steps of European integration most profoundly has influenced the trending behaviour of trade openness. Instead of exogenously <b>imposing</b> break <b>dates,</b> we endogenously determine the single most decisive breakpoint. To this end, we apply a state-of-the-art testing and estimation procedure for trend breaks under a minimal set of assumptions. Our empirical results suggest that trend breaks are a prevailing feature of export openness, and majorly occur in association with European integration events. We find that monetary integration matters most for Italian and French export openness, whereas German and Dutch trade patterns have been decisively shaped by real integration steps...|$|R

William Wallace and Richard Gibson were in partnership as builders and contractors from 1876 and worked on Catholic churches at Leyburn and Goondiwindi. By the mid-1880s they were in practice as architects and building surveyors in Warwick with work that included the St George's Masonic Hall (1887) [...] Stonemason John McCulloch, who had worked on the earlier presbytery, was awarded the contract for the brickwork. McCulloch worked on many prominent religious and civic buildings in Warwick including the Court House (1885), St Mark's Anglican Church (1867-1870), Our Lady of the Assumption Convent (1892-93) and the Warwick Town Hall (1888). The presbytery was built during a pronounced period of prosperity for Warwick and the surrounding agricultural district.
