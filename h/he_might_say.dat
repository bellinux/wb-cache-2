5|$|Through {{the night}} to the morning of September 22, Eisenhower and Nixon aides {{arranged}} the speech. The RNC worked to raise the $75,000 needed to buy the half hour of television time, while the Eisenhower staff secured sixty NBC stations to telecast the speech, with radio coverage from CBS and Mutual. The Nixon staff initially advocated a half hour that evening, Monday, September 22, to follow the immensely popular I Love Lucy show, but when the candidate indicated {{he could not be}} ready that soon, settled for 6:30pm Tuesday night, 9:30pm in the East, following the almost equally popular Texaco Star Theater, starring Milton Berle. The campaign arranged to use the El Capitan Theatre, in Hollywood, where several NBC variety shows were then broadcast, since its lighting was superior to that of NBC Studios. Nixon told the press that he would be addressing the nation on television, but refused to take any questions about what <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
25|$|On July 8, 2007, the Drudge Report {{indicated}} that Imus {{would return to}} the air before the 2008 presidential election. The New York Post reported on July 16, 2007, that Imus was in search of a black comedian to join the show upon its return to help cushion racially insensitive comments <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> on the air. The same paper reported on July 27, 2007, that CBS was close to a buyout of Imus's contract. The report also said Imus's representatives had contacted Buckley Broadcasting, Citadel Broadcasting, and Clear Channel Communications. On August 14, Imus reached a settlement with CBS Radio over his contract, leaving him free to pursue other media opportunities.|$|E
25|$|It may be {{difficult}} to see where simultaneity came into the Doppler shift calculation, and indeed the calculation is often preferred because one does {{not have to worry about}} simultaneity. As seen above, the ship twin can convert his received Doppler-shifted rate to a slower rate of the clock of the distant clock for both red and blue images. If he ignores simultaneity, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> his twin was aging at the reduced rate throughout the journey and therefore should be younger than he is. He is now back to square one, and has to take into account the change in his notion of simultaneity at the turnaround. The rate he can calculate for the image (corrected for Doppler effect) is the rate of the Earth twin's clock at the moment it was sent, not at the moment it was received. Since he receives an unequal number of red and blue shifted images, he should realize that the red and blue shifted emissions were not emitted over equal time periods for the Earth twin, and therefore he must account for simultaneity at a distance.|$|E
5000|$|Hare is the protector, the {{character}} {{who has a}} sense of responsibility. <b>He</b> <b>might</b> not <b>say</b> a lot but when he does, the other listen ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know he is}} good, Barbara; and as for truth, {{there is}} no {{question}} about it, because he has never said a word to me that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> not <b>say</b> to any girl." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{truth of}} the {{conclusion}} is independent of the truth of its premise - it is a 'non sequitur', since Jackson might be a mammal without being human. <b>He</b> <b>might</b> be, <b>say,</b> an elephant.|$|R
2500|$|Padre Pio died in 1968 {{at the age}} of 81. His health {{deteriorated}} in the 1960s but {{he continued}} his spiritual works. On September 21, 1968, the day after the 50th anniversary of his receiving the stigmata, Padre Pio felt great fatigue. [...] The next day, on September 22, 1968, he was supposed to offer a Solemn Mass, but feeling weak, he asked his superior if <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> a Low Mass instead, as he had done daily for years. Due to the large number of pilgrims present for the Mass, Padre Pio's superior decided the Solemn Mass must proceed. Padre Pio carried out his duties but appeared extremely weak and fragile. His voice was weak and, after the Mass had concluded, he nearly collapsed while walking down the altar steps. He needed help from his Capuchin brothers. This was his last celebration of the Mass.|$|E
2500|$|In 1983 Dahl {{reviewed}} Tony Clifton's God Cried, {{a picture}} {{book about the}} siege of West Beirut by the Israeli army during the 1982 Lebanon War. Dahl's review stated that the book would make readers [...] "violently anti-Israeli", writing, [...] "I am not anti-Semitic. I am anti-Israel." [...] Dahl told a reporter in 1983, [...] "There's a trait in the Jewish character that does provoke animosity ... I mean {{there is always a}} reason why anti-anything crops up anywhere; even a stinker like Hitler didn't just pick on them for no reason." [...] Dahl maintained friendships with a number of Jews, including philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin, who said, [...] "I thought <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> anything. Could have been pro-Arab or pro-Jew. There was no consistent line. He was a man who followed whims, which meant he would blow up in one direction, so to speak." [...] Amelia Foster, director of the Roald Dahl Museum in Great Missenden, states, [...] "This is again an example of how Dahl refused to take anything seriously, even himself. He was very angry at the Israelis. He had a childish reaction {{to what was going on}} in Israel. Dahl wanted to provoke, as he always provoked at dinner. His publisher was a Jew, his agent was a Jew... and he thought nothing but good things of them. He asked me to be his managing director, and I'm Jewish." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Clara; you {{certainly}} {{could not help}} what <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> to you. You could not refuse to listen to him. A lady in such a case, when she is on terms of intimacy with a gentleman, as you were with Mr. Fitzgerald, is bound to listen to him, and {{to give him an}} answer. You could not help what <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>say,</b> Clara. The question now is, what answer did you give to what he said?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>might</b> well <b>say</b> so, for {{the bloated}} old Spider had been {{flattened}} {{out by the}} weight of the Mole to nearly twice her size, and was apparently quite dead. In great concern, the host and hostess ran to raise her.|$|R
6000|$|Master went out, {{slamming}} {{the door in a}} fury; as well <b>he</b> <b>might.</b> <b>Says</b> <b>he,</b> [...] "If I can't have a comforable life, I can have a jolly one;" [...] and so he went off to the hed tavern, and came home that evening beesly intawsicated. When high words begin in a family drink generally follows on the genlman's side; and then, fearwell to all conjubial happyniss! These two pipple, so fond and loving, were now sirly, silent, and full of il wil. Master went out earlier, and came home later; missis cried more, and looked even paler than before.|$|R
60|$|The doctor's face {{expressed}} {{a kind of}} doubting admiration. 'If they were all as unemotional' <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have been <b>saying.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> {{it after}} me, {{but as he}} would not have an idea what we meant, I don't see that we should be getting any forwarder." ...|$|E
6000|$|Gyp took up her sunshade. She {{felt that}} she must get away; at any moment <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> {{something}} she could not bear--and the smell of mutton rising fast! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And Nurse some," [...] added Hal. [...] "Trust Jackie {{for taking}} care of himself." [...] Well <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> so, {{considering}} how full were John's mouth, hands, and pockets.|$|E

60|$|Instantly {{there was}} great {{excitement}} in the dormitory, {{and all of the}} students crowded around Polly, to learn what <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have to <b>say.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{could hardly}} utter the words, {{though she was}} not weeping. She was waiting with {{trembling}} eagerness for anything else <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have to <b>say.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Why nothing?" [...] {{she asked}} hurriedly, {{in order that}} <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> more and so make more splendid, more red, more darkly {{intertwined}} with smoke this flame rushing upwards.|$|E
60|$|Nicholas {{was delighted}} {{to find that the}} old gentleman spoke so warmly, and in the hope that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> {{something}} more to the same purpose, made no reply.|$|E
60|$|He {{spoke as}} fast as anybody! He had dark lively little eyes, too, all crinkled round like a Catholic priest's. Winifred felt {{suddenly}} <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> things she would regret.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I think <b>he</b> <b>might.</b> I must <b>say</b> this: that, had I {{known at}} the time the cause of the fray, I should have refused to {{accompany}} him.' ...|$|R
60|$|Songbird Powell and Tom and Sam Rover {{had seen}} the {{approach}} of the foreman, and men and boys ran out to listen to what <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have to <b>say.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{said those}} few commonplace words with needless hurry and eagerness, {{and with a}} curiosity to know what had brought me to Yorkshire, which <b>he</b> was perfectly--I <b>might</b> <b>say</b> childishly--incapable of concealing from notice.|$|R
60|$|This rather stilted {{beginning}} did not please him, and {{it became}} more and more obvious to him that, whatever <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>say,</b> his unhappiness had been directly caused by Katharine.|$|E
60|$|Festing {{noted that}} {{her voice was}} low like her mother's, {{but it had a}} firmer note. He could be frank with her, but there was a risk that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> too much.|$|E
60|$|After all {{he might}} know {{something}}, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> something which {{would help her}} to bear this intolerable misery of uncertainty: and on the merest chance of that she threw prudence to the winds.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>might</b> well <b>say</b> <b>he</b> {{had first}} {{seen it in}} his sister's face. She had brought him the paper, and was looking for {{something}} he wanted her to read to him, when 'Redclyffe Bay' met her eye, and then came the whole at one delightful glance. He saw the heightened colour, the exquisite smile, the tear-drop on the eyelash.|$|R
60|$|No; <b>he</b> decidedly <b>might</b> not <b>say</b> so. But as {{the letter}} was not yet {{finished}} when his mother and Mrs. Orme returned, I will not anticipate matters by giving Miss Furnival's reply.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} I see," [...] {{answered}} the chief yeoman, pointedly; and {{something in his}} manner attracted such attention that all in the crowd gathered around to learn what <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have to <b>say.</b>|$|R
60|$|We {{hastened to}} assure the Professor that, in {{accordance}} with the high standards of honour represented by our journal, we should of course regard anything that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>say</b> as ultramicroscopic and treat it accordingly.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have nothing}} in {{particular}} to do, this afternoon; and I have nothing particular to do." [...] He delivered himself of this assertion rather abruptly. At the same time, {{it was one of}} those promising statements which pave the way for anything. <b>He</b> <b>might</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "Having nothing particular to do to-day--why shouldn't we make love?" [...] Or <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "Having nothing particular to do to-morrow--why shouldn't we get the marriage license?" [...] Would he put it in that way? No: he made a proposal of quite another kind. He said, [...] "You seem to be fond of stories. Suppose I tell you a story?" ...|$|E
6000|$|There was one {{of those}} you-could-have-heard-a-pin-drop silences. Psmith was staring reflectively at the ceiling. Mr. Downing was looking as if at any moment <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>say,</b> [...] "Thwarted to me face, ha, ha! And by a very stripling!" ...|$|E
60|$|He went {{to sleep}} that night {{revising}} that conversation for the twentieth time, treasuring this and expanding that, and inserting things <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have said to Miss Walshingham, things <b>he</b> <b>might</b> still <b>say</b> about himself--in relation more or less explicit to her. He wasn't quite sure if he wouldn't like his arm to mortify a bit, which would make him interesting, or to heal up absolutely, which would show the exceptional purity of his blood.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] she answered. [...] "It just {{occurred}} to me. He and Louise {{have known each}} other for such a long time, and I wondered what <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have to <b>say</b> about it." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{excitement}} {{of the two men}} and their interest in each other increased every moment; the one being full of the idea of having made a wonderful discovery of, as it were, a lost community, the other being equally full of the delight of once more talking to a man--a seaman--a messmate, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> soon <b>say,</b> for <b>he</b> meant to feed him like a prince.|$|R
