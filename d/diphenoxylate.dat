25|$|In overdoses, {{atropine}} is poisonous. Atropine {{is sometimes}} added to potentially addictive drugs, particularly anti-diarrhea opioid {{drugs such as}} <b>diphenoxylate</b> or difenoxin, wherein the secretion-reducing effects of the atropine can also aid the anti-diarrhea effects.|$|E
25|$|Codeine is used {{to treat}} mild to {{moderate}} pain and to relieve cough. Codeine {{is also used to}} treat diarrhea and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, although loperamide (which is available without a prescription for milder diarrhea), <b>diphenoxylate,</b> paregoric or even laudanum are more frequently used to treat severe diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|Pethidine, {{also known}} as {{meperidine}} and sold under the brand name Demerol among others, is a synthetic opioid pain medication of the phenylpiperidine class. Synthesized in 1939 as a potential anticholinergic agent by the German chemist Otto Eisleb, its analgesic properties were first recognized by Otto Schaumann while working for IG Farben, Germany. Pethidine is the prototype of a large family of analgesics including the pethidine 4-phenylpiperidines (piminodine, anileridine and others), the prodines (alphaprodine, MPPP, etc.), bemidones (ketobemidone, etc.) and others more distant, including <b>diphenoxylate</b> and analogues.|$|E
50|$|Lomotil (<b>diphenoxylate</b> and atropine) {{contains}} <b>diphenoxylate</b> hydrochloride 2.5 mg, and {{atropine sulfate}} 0.025 mg to discourage deliberate overdosage and injection.|$|E
50|$|Its active {{ingredients}} are <b>diphenoxylate</b> and atropine. <b>Diphenoxylate</b> is anti-diarrheal and atropine is anticholinergic. A subtherapeutic amount of atropine sulfate is present to discourage deliberate overdosage. Atropine has no anti-diarrheal properties, but will cause tachycardia when overused. The medication <b>diphenoxylate</b> works by {{slowing down the}} movement of the intestines. In some cases Lomotil has been shown to ease symptoms of opiate/opioid withdrawal.|$|E

5000|$|Preparations {{containing}} {{small amounts}} of opium or <b>diphenoxylate</b> (used to treat diarrhea); ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Diphenoxylate</b> is metabolized in {{the body}} to yield difenoxin. Difenoxin is another {{centrally}} acting antidiarrheal that is 250 to 400 percent the strength of <b>diphenoxylate</b> via the oral route and is also able to be manufactured and is distributed as Motofen, (1 mg difenoxin/25 µg atropine), which {{was introduced in the}} United States in the late 1990s after being discovered in 1970 at Janssen.|$|E
50|$|The diphenoxylate/loperamide {{subfamily}} of gastrointestinal drugs works {{directly on}} opioid receptors, {{which can be}} found in the intestine, brain, and spinal cord. <b>Diphenoxylate</b> itself crosses the blood-brain barrier. This being the case, this medication is potentially habit-forming and can generate significant tolerance if taken continuously for a protracted period. Physical dependence is most common particularly with high doses and/or long-term use. The CNS penetration of <b>diphenoxylate</b> makes it an agent that can cause euphoria and other psychoactive effects, which could over time lead to habituation and dependency on the drug in the user. As with other medicinal opioids, iatrogenic addiction is uncommon although physical dependence secondary to treatment of a functional bowel disorder with <b>diphenoxylate</b> for more than 45-90 days may very well occur; it typically requires the use of high doses to impart a morbid seek orientation for the drug in the user. Because of this, <b>diphenoxylate</b> is manufactured and marketed as a combination drug with atropine (Lomotil, Pfizer) as an abuse deterrent. Lomotil was used during the Apollo program, as was pethidine.|$|E
50|$|Loperamide {{is often}} {{compared}} to <b>diphenoxylate.</b> Recent {{studies suggest that}} loperamide is more effective and has lower neural side effects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diphenoxylate</b> is the {{prototype}} of a small subfamily of opioids (the phenylpiperidines) including difenoxin (diphenoxylic acid), an active metabolite of <b>diphenoxylate</b> produced in the human body, and loperamide, which unlike the former two works exclusively in the intestines because it only crosses the blood-brain barrier in very small amounts. It was discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1956. It is a congener to the narcotic pethidine. Other somewhat more distant relatives include alphaprodine and piritramide.|$|E
50|$|In 1958, {{the same}} line of work yielded “one of the {{greatest}} advances of the 20th century psychiatry", haloperidol, as well as <b>diphenoxylate,</b> which lacked the opioid's analgesic properties but still stopped peristalsis in the intestines, a typical side effect of opioids; Janssen brought <b>diphenoxylate</b> to market as a drug to treat diarrhea. And through further advances, Janssen created fentanyl in 1960, which proved to be ten times more potent than phenoperidine.|$|E
5000|$|Difenoxin (Motofen, R-15403) is an opioid drug used, {{often in}} {{combination}} with atropine, to treat diarrhea. [...] It is the principal metabolite of <b>diphenoxylate.</b>|$|E
50|$|Loperamide {{hydrochloride}} {{was first}} synthesized by Paul Janssen from Janssen Pharmaceutica in Beerse (Belgium), following previous discoveries of <b>diphenoxylate</b> hydrochloride (1956) and fentanyl citrate (1960).|$|E
50|$|Medications may {{consist of}} stool {{softeners}} and laxatives in IBS-C and antidiarrheals (e.g., opiate, opioid, or opioid analogs such as loperamide, codeine, <b>diphenoxylate)</b> if diarrhea is predominant.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diphenoxylate</b> (INN, BAN) (brand name Diocalm), or <b>diphenoxylate</b> {{hydrochloride}} (USAN), is a centrally active opioid drug of the phenylpiperidine {{series that}} {{is used for the}} treatment of diarrhea. It acts by slowing intestinal contractions and peristalsis allowing the body to consolidate intestinal contents and prolong transit time, thus allowing the intestines to draw moisture out of them at a normal or higher rate and therefore stop the formation of loose and liquid stools. It is the main active ingredient in the anti-peristaltic medication Lomotil, which also contains atropine.|$|E
50|$|Many {{prescription}} drugs are commonly abused, particularly those marketed as analgesics, including fentanyl (Duragesic), hydrocodone (Vicodin), oxycodone (OxyContin), oxymorphone (Opana), propoxyphene (Darvon), hydromorphone (Dilaudid), meperidine (Demerol), and <b>diphenoxylate</b> (Lomotil).|$|E
5000|$|Difenoxin, an {{antidiarrheal}} drug, such as {{when combined}} with atropine (Motofen) (difenoxin is 2-3 times more potent than <b>diphenoxylate,</b> the active ingredient in Lomotil, which is in Schedule V) ...|$|E
50|$|The drug {{combination}} is generally safe in short-term use and with recommended dosage. In doses {{used for the}} treatment of diarrhea, whether acute or chronic, <b>diphenoxylate</b> has not produced addiction.|$|E
5000|$|... 4-Phenylpiperidine is {{the base}} {{structure}} {{for a variety}} of opioids, such as pethidine (meperidine), ketobemidone, alvimopan, loperamide, and <b>diphenoxylate.</b> Other pharmaceutical drugs derived from 4-phenylpiperdine include haloperidol, ropitoin, vesamicol, enefexine, and Altapizone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diphenoxylate</b> {{is listed}} in {{national}} controlled-substances and drugs laws such as pure <b>diphenoxylate</b> being in Annex/Schedule/List II of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 and also in similarly numbered schedules of laws passed to implement the Convention such as the Canadian Controlled Substances Act and the Betäubungsmittelgesetz in Germany and the Suchtgiftverordnung of Austria. This level of regulation is also implemented in the Misuse of Drugs Act of 1971 (UK), the French opium law of 31 December 1970, and royal decrees and laws passed by practically all other countries in Europe, the Pacific Rim, South Asia and the Middle East.|$|E
50|$|In overdoses, {{atropine}} is poisonous. Atropine {{is sometimes}} added to potentially addictive drugs, particularly anti-diarrhea opioid {{drugs such as}} <b>diphenoxylate</b> or difenoxin, wherein the secretion-reducing effects of the atropine can also aid the anti-diarrhea effects.|$|E
50|$|Manufacturing unit at Thane {{produces}} Active Pharmaceuticals Ingredients (also {{called as}} Bulk Drugs) and is ISO 9001 certified and has Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), Australia, and approval for 3 of its major products namely <b>Diphenoxylate</b> Hydrochloride, Haloperidol and Propanthelene Bromide.|$|E
5000|$|Some centrally-acting antidiarrheals, such as <b>diphenoxylate</b> (Lomotil) when {{mixed with}} {{atropine}} (to make it unpleasant {{for people to}} grind up, cook, and inject). Difenoxin with atropine (Motofen) has been moved to Schedule IV. Without atropine, these drugs are in Schedule II.|$|E
50|$|Similar to {{loperamide}} and difenoxin preparations, {{the usual}} protocol {{is to take}} a loading dose (usually two tablets or the quantity of liquid containing 5 mg of <b>diphenoxylate)</b> and then the standard dose of one tablet every 3 to 4 hours prn over a time period not to exceed 48 hours unless so ordered by the physician. Long-term intermittent prn users should contact their physician if the need for it arises more than was usual at the outset of therapy as tolerance to <b>diphenoxylate</b> can occur. Those taking it in large quantities or continuously over an extended period should taper down the dose on a schedule devised by the physician and/or pharmacist.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diphenoxylate</b> {{works by}} {{decreasing}} {{the speed and}} amplitude of wave-like movements of the intestines (peristalsis) therefore allowing the body time to remove moisture from the intestinal contents and consolidate waste product into a dense solid form rather than loose and watery as is diarrhea.|$|E
50|$|Treatment {{consists}} {{mainly of}} replacing fluids and salts lost because of diarrhea. Replacement by mouth is satisfactory for most people, but some {{may need to}} receive fluids intravenously. Antidiarrheal drugs (such as <b>diphenoxylate</b> or loperamide) may prolong the infection {{and should not be}} used.|$|E
50|$|Codeine is used {{to treat}} mild to {{moderate}} pain and to relieve cough. Codeine {{is also used to}} treat diarrhea and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, although loperamide (which is available without a prescription for milder diarrhea), <b>diphenoxylate,</b> paregoric or even laudanum are more frequently used to treat severe diarrhea.|$|E
50|$|This {{combination}} medication {{should not}} be confused with Lomotil (2.5 mg <b>diphenoxylate</b> and 0.025 mg atropine - a Schedule V Combination), because the active ingredients in the two medications are different compounds, except for the inclusion of atropine. Motofen is approximately 2 to 4 times more effective in treating symptoms than Lomotil.|$|E
50|$|Piritramide was {{developed}} and patented in Belgium, at Janssen, in 1960. It {{is part of an}} eponymous two-member class of opioids in clinical use with the other being bezitramide (Burgodin). The closest chemical and structural relatives of piritramide in clinical use include the <b>diphenoxylate</b> family, fentanyl (both Janssen discoveries) and somewhat more distantly alphaprodine.|$|E
50|$|Diarrhoea {{resulting}} from cyclic or diarrhoea-predominant IBS {{may not be}} optimally treated with <b>diphenoxylate</b> or difenoxin, and may not respond to a meaningful degree to loperamide; thus, diarrhoea and cramping which does not respond to belladonna derivatives and non-centrally-acting soothing and/or stool-desiccating agents are often treated with conservative doses of codeine, especially where paregoric and/or laudanum are not currently in general use.|$|E
50|$|This {{medication}} {{is classified as}} a Schedule V under the United States' Comprehensive Drug Abuse Control & Prevention Act of 1970 aka Controlled Substances Act (CSA) (21 U.S.C. § 801 et. seq.) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in the United States when used in preparations. When <b>diphenoxylate</b> is used alone, it is classified as a Schedule II; having one or more other active ingredients makes it Schedule V. As such, diphenoxylate/atropine tablets are under state and local control and where allowed by state law, {{can be obtained by}} signing a log book and the customer can receive up to 48 units (tablets or capsules) in any 48-hour period, much like the 4 fl. oz. limit on codeine, dihydrocodeine, dionine (ethylmorphine), and opium cough syrups and gastrointestinal drugs.Bulk <b>diphenoxylate</b> (Schedule II) has a DEA ACSCN of 9170 and an annual aggregate manufacturing quota of 750 kilos as of 2013.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, {{difenoxin}} and atropine tablets are Schedule IV {{and therefore}} federally controlled and require a prescription, loperamide is unscheduled {{and not on}} prescription, and diphenoxylic acid is classified {{as a form of}} <b>diphenoxylate.</b> Other Schedule IV narcotics also include butorphanol nasal spray, pentazocine, propoxyphene-based mixtures and others of the same type. Unscheduled narcotics and opioid agonists include loperamide (OTC), and nalbuphine (Rx).|$|E
50|$|It is {{also used}} to {{discourage}} abuse in certain opiate analgesics due to its unpleasant side effects at high doses. While therapeutic doses of phenyltoloxamine can generate mild to moderate euphoria as can many of its close chemical relatives, much higher doses have a side effect profile similar to that of atropine, which {{is also used}} in this fashion for tablets of <b>diphenoxylate</b> and morphine for oral administration.|$|E
5000|$|The prefix of [...] "co-" [...] is {{used for}} many {{combination}} drugs, including opioid with paracetamol or aspirin analgesics (e.g., Co-codamol, Co-codaprin, Co-dydramol, Co-proxamol). The other commonly encountered opioid combination is the anti-diarrhoeal, non-analgesic mixture of <b>diphenoxylate</b> and atropine, Co-phenotrope (a.k.a. Lomotil). Also antibiotics (e.g., Co-fluampicil and Co-trimoxazole), drugs to lower blood pressure (e.g., Co-tenidone), diuretics (e.g., Co-amilofruse and Co-amilozide), gastrointestinal drugs (e.g., Co-danthrusate), and anti-Parkinsonism agents such as Co-careldopa, Co-beneldopa, and others (e.g., Co-cyprindiol).|$|E
