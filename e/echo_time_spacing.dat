40|$|The spin-spin {{relaxation}} rate R 2 (= 1 /T 2) in hydrogel foams measured {{by use of}} a multiple spin echo sequence {{was found to be}} dependent on the <b>echo</b> <b>time</b> <b>spacing.</b> (Baete and De Deene. Proc. Intl. Soc. Magn. Reson. Med. 15 : 37, 2007). This property, referred to as R 2 -dispersion, originates to a large extent from molecular self-diffusion of water within internal field gradients that result from magnetic susceptibility differences between the gel and air phase. Another contribution to the R 2 relaxation rate is surface relaxation. Numerical simulations are performed to investigate the relation between the foam microstructure (the mean air bubble radius and standard deviation of the air bubble radius) at one hand and the R 2 -dispersion at the other hand. The simulated R 2 -dispersions of gel foam are in agreement with measured R 2 -dispersions. By correlating the R 2 -dispersion parameters and simulated microstructure properties a relationship is obtained that enables the mean air bubble size to be derived from measured R 2 -dispersion curves. The R 2 - derived mean air bubble size of a hydrogel foam is in agreement with the bubble size measured with X-ray micro- CT.

METHODS: 25 patients with spondyloarthritis and Achilles symptoms were studied with MRI and ultrasound. MR images of the Achilles tendon were acquired using T 1 -weighted spin echo, gradient echo and ultrashort <b>echo</b> <b>time</b> (UTE) sequences with <b>echo</b> <b>times</b> (TE) between 0. 07 and 16 ms, before and after intravenous contrast medium.

40|$|Purpose: T 2 {{relaxation}} time measurements in the prostate are {{complicated by the}} structure of prostate tissue which consists of fluid filled glands surrounded by epithelial and stromal cells. Since the glands are large relative to diffusion distances, there is little water exchange between the two compartments and T 2 s are biexponential. Because the relative size and characteristics of the two compartments change in prostate tumours, accurate measurement {{of the characteristics of}} each may provide useful information on tumour grade. The {{purpose of this paper is}} therefore to determine the <b>echo</b> <b>times</b> that provide the greatest precision in measurements of prostate T 2 s. Materials and Methods: T 2 s were measured in a group of twenty-five men with biopsy-proven prostate cancer. Subjects were scanned at 3 T with a sixteen-echo turbo-spin echo T 2 -mapping sequence. Normal prostate T 2 s were measured in areas showing no disease. Optimum <b>echo</b> <b>times</b> for measurement of normal prostate T 2 s were found by calculating the covariance matrix which provides estimates of parameter variance. <b>Echo</b> <b>times</b> that minimize T 2 variance were then found by searching over grids of different <b>echo</b> <b>times.</b> Optima for four to eight echo acquisitions were found. Optima were tested by Monte-Carlo simulation. Results: Fast and slow T 2 s were 60 ms and 360 ms respectively. The fast signal fraction was 0. 6. Optimum <b>echo</b> <b>times</b> were between 0 and 780 ms depending on the number of echoes acquired.

40|$|MRI {{with zero}} <b>echo</b> <b>time</b> is a robust, fast, and silent {{approach}} for three-dimensional (3 -D) imaging of samples with short transverse relaxation times. In this article, {{the principles of}} acquiring and reconstructing data with zero <b>echo</b> <b>time</b> are described and complemented by discussions of implementation details, potential limitations, and selected applications, as well as advanced and related techniques. MR imaging of samples with very short T 2 s requires spatial encoding and data acquisition to be started and completed rapidly after signal creation. One powerful way of meeting these requirements is with 3 -D radial center-out k-space encoding. In particular, when RF excitation is performed after switching on the projection gradient, such schemes achieve an <b>echo</b> <b>time</b> of zero and immediately have available maximum k-space speed. MRI with zero <b>echo</b> <b>time</b> poses two major challenges. First, RF pulses need to be of high bandwidth to uniformly excite {{the full range of}} Larmor frequencies induced by the projection gradient.

40|$|The BOLD signal {{consists}} of an intravascular (IV) and an extravas-cular (EV) component from both small and large vessels.

Spin-echo acquisition suppresses EV BOLD from large veins and reflects predominantly blood T 2 changes and EV BOLD signal from small blood vessels. At a short <b>echo</b> <b>time</b> (32 ms), diffusion gradient-based suppression of blood signals resulted in a 75 % and 20 % decrease in spin-echo BOLD changes at 4 T and 7 T, respectively. However, at <b>echo</b> <b>times</b> (55 – 65 ms) approximating tissue T 2 typically used for optimal BOLD contrast, these gradients had much smaller effects at both fields, consis-tent with the decreasing blood T 2 with increasing field strength.
