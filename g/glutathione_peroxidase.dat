5|$|The {{glutathione}} system includes glutathione, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidases, and glutathione S-transferases. This {{system is}} found in animals, plants and microorganisms. <b>Glutathione</b> <b>peroxidase</b> is an enzyme containing four selenium-cofactors that catalyzes the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides. There are at least four different <b>glutathione</b> <b>peroxidase</b> isozymes in animals. <b>Glutathione</b> <b>peroxidase</b> 1 is the most abundant and is a very efficient scavenger of hydrogen peroxide, while <b>glutathione</b> <b>peroxidase</b> 4 is most active with lipid hydroperoxides. Surprisingly, <b>glutathione</b> <b>peroxidase</b> 1 is dispensable, as mice lacking this enzyme have normal lifespans, but they are hypersensitive to induced oxidative stress. In addition, the glutathione S-transferases show high activity with lipid peroxides. These enzymes are at particularly high levels in the liver and also serve in detoxification metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative {{damage in}} DNA can cause cancer. Several {{antioxidant}} enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, <b>glutathione</b> <b>peroxidase,</b> glutathione reductase, glutathione S-transferase etc. protect DNA from oxidative stress. It {{has been proposed}} that polymorphisms in these enzymes are associated with DNA damage and subsequently the individual's risk of cancer susceptibility.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} α-tocopherol form is the most {{important}} lipid-soluble antioxidant, and that it protects membranes from oxidation by reacting with lipid radicals produced in the lipid peroxidation chain reaction. This removes the free radical intermediates and prevents the propagation reaction from continuing. This reaction produces oxidised α-tocopheroxyl radicals that can be recycled back to the active reduced form through reduction by other antioxidants, such as ascorbate, retinol or ubiquinol. This is in line with findings showing that α-tocopherol, but not water-soluble antioxidants, efficiently protects <b>glutathione</b> <b>peroxidase</b> 4 (GPX4)-deficient cells from cell death. GPx4 is the only known enzyme that efficiently reduces lipid-hydroperoxides within biological membranes.|$|E

25|$|Glutathione (GSH) {{participates in}} {{leukotriene}} synthesis {{and is a}} cofactor for the enzyme <b>glutathione</b> <b>peroxidase.</b> It is also important as a hydrophilic molecule that is added to lipophilic toxins and waste in the liver during biotransformation before they can {{become part of the}} bile. Glutathione is also needed for the detoxification of methylglyoxal, a toxin produced as a byproduct of metabolism.|$|E
25|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} are {{dangerous}} by-products that sometimes {{result from the}} use of oxygen in organisms. Important examples include; oxygen free radicals such as the highly-dangerous superoxide O2−, and the less harmful hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The body uses superoxide dismutase to reduce superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide. <b>Glutathione</b> <b>peroxidase</b> and similar enzymes then convert the H2O2 to water and dioxygen.|$|E

25|$|Catalase, {{which is}} {{concentrated}} in peroxisomes located next to mitochondria, reacts with the hydrogen peroxide to catalyze the formation of water and oxygen. <b>Glutathione</b> <b>peroxidase</b> reduces hydrogen peroxide by transferring {{the energy of the}} reactive peroxides to a very small sulfur-containing protein called glutathione.

25|$|Because free {{radicals}} {{are necessary for}} life, the body {{has a number of}} mechanisms to minimize free-radical-induced damage and to repair damage that occurs, such as the enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, <b>glutathione</b> <b>peroxidase</b> and glutathione reductase. In addition, antioxidants {{play a key role in}} these defense mechanisms. These are often the three vitamins, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin E and polyphenol antioxidants. Furthermore, there is good evidence indicating that bilirubin and uric acid can act as antioxidants to help neutralize certain {{free radicals}}. Bilirubin comes from the breakdown of red blood cells' contents, while uric acid is a breakdown product of purines. Too much bilirubin, though, can lead to jaundice, which could eventually damage the central nervous system, while too much uric acid causes gout.|$|E
50|$|In plants, the glutathione-ascorbate cycle {{operates}} in the cytosol, mitochondria, plastids and peroxisomes. Since glutathione, ascorbate and NADPH {{are present in}} high concentrations in plant cells {{it is assumed that}} the glutathione-ascorbate cycle plays a key role for H2O2 detoxification. Nevertheless, other enzymes (peroxidases) including peroxiredoxins and <b>glutathione</b> <b>peroxidases,</b> which use thioredoxins or glutaredoxins as reducing substrates, also contribute to H2O2 removal in plants.|$|R
50|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} forms a homotetramer structure. As with other <b>glutathione</b> <b>peroxidases,</b> GPx1 has a conserved {{catalytic}} tetrad composed of Sec or Cys, Gln, Trp, and Asn, where the Sec {{is surrounded by}} four arginines (R 57, 103, 184, 185; bovine numbering) and a lysine of an adjacent subunit (K 91'). These 5 residues bind glutathione (GSH) and are only present in GPx1.|$|R
50|$|Although it is toxic {{in large}} doses, {{selenium}} {{is an essential}} micronutrient for animals. In plants, it sometimes occurs in amounts toxic as forage, e.g. locoweed. Selenium is {{a component of the}} amino acids selenocysteine and selenomethionine. In humans, selenium is a trace element nutrient that functions as cofactor for <b>glutathione</b> <b>peroxidases</b> and certain forms of thioredoxin reductase. Selenium-containing proteins are produced from inorganic selenium via the intermediacy of selenophosphate (PSeO33−).|$|R
25|$|Arachidonic acid (AA) has double {{bonds between}} carbons 5-6, 8-9, 11-12, and 14-15; these double bonds {{are in the}} cis (see Cis–trans {{isomerism}} or Z {{as opposed to the}} trans or E configuration. ALOX15 adds a hydroperoxy residue to AA at carbons 15 {{and to a lesser extent}} 12 to from 15(S)-hydroperoxy-5Z,8Z,11Z,13E-eicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)-HpETE) and 12(S)-hydroperoxy-5Z,8Z,10E, 15S-eicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HpETE); the purified enzyme makes 15(S)-HpETE and 12(S)-HpETE in a product ratio of ~4-9 to 1. Both products may be rapidly reduced by ubiquitous cellular <b>Glutathione</b> <b>peroxidase</b> enzymes to their corresponding hydroxy analogs, 15(S)-HETE (see 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid) and 12(S)-HETE (see 12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid). 15(S)-HpETE and 15(S)-HETE bind to and activate the Leukotriene B4 receptor 2, activate the Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, and at high concentrations cause cells to generate toxic reactive oxygen species; one or more of these effects may be at least in part responsible for their ability to promote inflammatory responses, alter the growth of various times of human cancer cell lines, contract various types of blood vessels, and stimulate pathological fibrosis in pulmonary arteries and liver (see 15-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid#15(S)-HpETE and 15(S)-HETE). 15(S)-HpETE and 15(S)-HETE are esterified into membrane phospholipids where they may be stored and subsequently released during cell stimulation. As one aspect of this processing, the two products are progressively esterified in mitochondria membrane phospholipids during the maturation of red blood cells (see erythropoiesis) and thereby may serve to signal for the degradation of the mitochondria and the maturation of these precursors to red blood cells in mice. This pathway operates along with two other mitochondria-removing pathways and therefore does not appear essential for mouse red blood cell maturation.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the idea}} is controversial, some {{evidence}} suggests a link between aging and mitochondrial genome dysfunction. In essence, mutations in mtDNA upset a careful balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and enzymatic ROS scavenging (by enzymes like superoxide dismutase, catalase, <b>glutathione</b> <b>peroxidase</b> and others). However, some mutations that increase ROS production (e.g., by reducing antioxidant defenses) in worms increase, rather than decrease, their longevity. Also, naked mole rats, rodents {{about the size of}} mice, live about eight times longer than mice despite having reduced, compared to mice, antioxidant defenses and increased oxidative damage to biomolecules. Once, there was thought to be a positive feedback loop at work (a 'Vicious Cycle'); as mitochondrial DNA accumulates genetic damage caused by free radicals, the mitochondria lose function and leak free radicals into the cytosol. A decrease in mitochondrial function reduces overall metabolic efficiency. However, this concept was conclusively disproved when it was demonstrated that mice, which were genetically altered to accumulate mtDNA mutations at accelerated rate do age prematurely, but their tissues do not produce more ROS as predicted by the 'Vicious Cycle' hypothesis. Supporting a link between longevity and mitochondrial DNA, some studies have found correlations between biochemical properties of the mitochondrial DNA and the longevity of species. Extensive research is being conducted to further investigate this link and methods to combat aging. Presently, gene therapy and nutraceutical supplementation are popular areas of ongoing research. Bjelakovic et al. analyzed the results of 78 studies between 1977 and 2012, involving a total of 296,707 participants, and concluded that antioxidant supplements do not reduce all-cause mortality nor extend lifespan, while some of them, such as beta carotene, vitamin E, and higher doses of vitamin A, may actually increase mortality.|$|E
