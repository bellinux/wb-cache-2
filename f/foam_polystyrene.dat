40|$|Liquefied {{natural gas}} is shipped across the oceans in large marine {{carriers}}. The carriers house the LNG using several different insulation systems. One of these systems involves large aluminum spheres insulated with polystyrene <b>foam.</b> <b>Polystyrene</b> foam is very susceptible to heat degradation. This raised issues as {{to the extent of}} possible insulation failure caused by a large ship fire. Experiments were done investigating the nature of polystyrene’s thermal degradation, notably by Brauman, Chen, and Matzinger and Butler. A large scale investigation was also performed by Sandia National Laboratory. However, computational modeling of the degradation was lacking. This work set out to build comprehensive models of the experiments performed by BCM, Butler, and Sandia. The models were created using COMSOL Multiphysics, a complex finite element method computational software. The thermal degradation of polystyrene is a complex process involving moving boundaries, phase transitions, and temperature dependent physical properties. The BCM and Butler experiments provided the most amount of detail and were used to test the accuracy of the models and methods used within them. The value of principal interest was the overall regression rate of the material, a variable that could be calculated by the models and compared directly with experimentally measured values. Modeling started with an extensive literature review of the physical properties of dense and <b>foam</b> <b>polystyrene.</b> The BCM experiments were first considered as they were the least complex. Both a transient and a steady-state model of the BCM experiments were built. Although detail of the transient heat up phase was lost, the steady-state model provided a better fit with experiment. With a good fit of the BCM experiments, the techniques were carried forward and adapted to the more complex Butler <b>foam</b> <b>polystyrene</b> experiments. Again, regression rates for the model were reasonably close to those measured by experiment. Next, the Sandia experiment was investigated. Here, the values of interest were no longer regression rates but insulation failure times and cargo tank heat fluxes. The Sandia experiment presented a new complication in the form of necessary information not being available, notably the surface emissivity of the aluminum scrim used. With the model, it was found that a very low surface emissivity, one near the lowest commercially available, was required to match the experimental results...|$|E

40|$|Aims: The {{purpose of}} the present work was to {{consider}} the effect of different samples thicknesses on the acoustic absorption coefficient. Materials and Methods: An impedance tube was built with two microphones accordance to ISO- 10534 and the American Society for Testing Materials-E 1050 standards. For the measurement of absorption, the study was carried for 25 and 30 mm thicknesses of closed cell polyurethane <b>foam,</b> <b>polystyrene,</b> polyvinyl chloride (PVC), rubber, mineral wool, carpet, and glass samples. Measurements were performed by impedance tube and VA-lab 4 software. Results: In carpet and mineral wool with more thickness, the absorption was increased but, the carpet with less thickness showed more sound absorption in the frequency range of 1500 - 3600 Hz. The peak of the absorption coefficient of 25 mm glass was 0. 36 that the amount was reduced to 0. 2 in the 30 mm thickness. Furthermore, the difference between the peak absorption of two thicknesses in polystyrene sample was equal to 0. 29. In fact, polystyrene with less thickness had better sound absorption. The same situation was happened for glass in frequencies of below 4500 Hz with less thickness. Conclusion: Incident sound energy, which is not absorbed, must be reflected, transmitted, or dissipated. The porous materials had a higher absorption coefficient. Carpet and mineral wool samples had the highest absorption coefficient, but the materials such as polyurethane foam, PVC, and rubber had lower sound absorption...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} {{present study was}} to clarify the {{relationship}} between the transmissibility of the information through tactile perception and the combination of materials and shape of a product. In order to make clear the transmissibility by the finger and the foot, two experiments were carried out. In the first experiment, the transmissibility of operation information using push button was discussed. The operation information was “on- off”, “low- middle- high ” and “up- down”. There were nine kinds of button’s shape and four kinds of the materials; alloy of aluminum, poly methyl methacrylate, woof of hoonoki and <b>foam</b> <b>polystyrene.</b> The suitable samples to transmit the information were selected by the sighted and the visually impaired. In the second experiment, the transmissibility of information using tactile tiles was discussed. The information was as follows; “goal”, “for men”, “for women”, “up”, “down ” and “danger”. Tactile tiles with eight kinds of raised parts were used as samples. Those were made of five kinds of materials; concrete, unsaturated polyester, silicon rubber, the alloy of aluminum and hardwood. The subjects were selected the most suitable sample for the information. Obtained data were analyzed using dual scaling method and Hayashi’s quantification theory I and II analysis. The results were summarized as follows: (1) The shape of the buttons for “on- off ” and “low- middle- high ” greatly affected the transmissibility of the information, but the difference of material does not affect it.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This report {{presents}} {{new information}} regarding emissions of CFC 12 {{used to make}} extruded <b>polystyrene</b> <b>foam</b> products. Earlier reports identified {{a significant difference in}} emission rates from extruded <b>polystyrene</b> <b>foam</b> that are used to estimate the amount of the chlorofluorocarbon yet to be released from these materials – the banked amount.

This report will provide evidence that CFC 12 is emitted from extruded <b>polystyrene</b> <b>foam</b> more than an order of magnitude slower than some earlier reported rates, resulting in a bank of CFC 12, yet to be released from the foam, potentially larger than previously estimated.
