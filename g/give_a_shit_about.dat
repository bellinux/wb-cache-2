This subterfuge, however, proved too much for Harry. He never spoke to Jack again. When Harry Warner died on July 27, 1958, Jack did not attend the funeral, and he departed for his annual vacation at Cap d'Antibes. [...] Asked to respond to his brother's death, Jack said, [...] "I didn't <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>shit</b> <b>about</b> Harry." [...] At the same time, Jack took pride in the fact that President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent him a letter of condolence.|$|E
500|$|Described by her actress, Lauren Cohan, as [...] "a female Humphrey Bogart", Bela is [...] "a {{little bit}} manipulative" [...] and she [...] "always {{wants to be}} in control". According to series creator Eric Kripke, the writers {{conceptualized}} the character as [...] "someone [...] really never come across before" [...] because, though she moves throughout the supernatural world, Bela has no interest in the [...] "altruistic or obsessed or revenge-minded motives of hunting". Writer and producer Sera Gamble summarized the writing team's characterization of Bela as a greedy [...] "mercenary that [...] just [...] <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>shit</b> <b>about</b> the cause".

500|$|The album debuted on the Billboard 200 {{at number}} 144. Geffen shipped {{about half of}} the initial US {{pressing}} to the American Northwest, where it sold out quickly and was unavailable for days. Geffen reputedly put production of all other albums on hold in order to fulfill demand in the region. Nevermind was already selling well but, over the next few months, the momentum increased significantly as [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] unexpectedly became more and more popular. The song's video had received a world premiere on MTV's late night alternative show 120 Minutes but it soon proved so popular that the channel began playing it during the day. The record was soon certified Gold, but the band was relatively uninterested in the achievement. Novoselic recalled, [...] "Yeah I was happy about it. It was pretty cool. It was kind of neat.

2500|$|Williams {{took the}} 2003 Kansas {{team to the}} NCAA {{championship}} game against Syracuse. Syracuse defeated Kansas, 81–78, to win the championship. The {{end of the season}} brought a cloud of uncertainty over KU, as Williams' future was up in the air. During CBS' exit interview with Williams, he was consistently asked if he was taking the North Carolina job instead of his current Kansas team's effort, eventually inspiring him to say to the reporter [...] "I could <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>shit</b> <b>about</b> North Carolina right now" [...] to the live mic. Chancellor Robert Hemenway fired KU Athletic Director Al Bohl, and while he cited Bohl's involvement in an academic scandal at Fresno State, many perceived the move as a desperate move to keep Williams at KU, as the relationship between Bohl and Williams was very poor. Bohl reacted angrily, accusing Williams of engineering the firing.|$|E

Diddley {{had been asked to}} sing Tennessee Ernie Ford's hit [...] "Sixteen Tons", which he agreed.

Diddley later recalls, [...] "Ed Sullivan says to me in plain words: 'You are the first black boy—quote—that ever double crossed me!' I was ready to fight, because I was a little young dude off the streets of Chicago, an' him callin' me 'black' in them days was as bad as sayin' 'nigger'. My manager says to me 'That's Mr. Sullivan!' I said: 'I don’t <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>shit</b> <b>about</b> Mr. Sullivan, e don't talk to me like that!' An' so he told me, he says, 'I'll see that you never work no more in show business.

2500|$|On May 21, 2014, Smith {{appeared}} {{along with}} other celebrities in Washington, D.C. at a White House talent show held by Michelle Obama which was organized to raise awareness for Turnaround Arts, a program enacted {{under the guidance of}} the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities (PCAH) to increase performance and achievement at some of the lowest-ranked schools in the country through arts education. Students from eight schools around the country participated in the show which featured musical theatre, spoken word and interpretative dance. President Barack Obama made a surprise appearance at the event. Smith adopted a school in Greenfield, California also lobbied Speaker of the House of Representatives John Boehner for increased funding for arts education and that it is a personal issue for him. Smith said [...] "I didn't <b>give</b> <b>a</b> <b>shit</b> <b>about</b> science, math or English when I was in school and music was the only reason I wanted to go. It got me interested in other subjects and I would've never graduated without it. If kids can connect with some sort of art in some way, it will enrich their lives in ways they probably can't fully comprehend at the time." [...] Earlier in the week, Smith was joined by former New York Yankee and musician, Bernie Williams at Savoy Elementary School in Washington, D.C. where together they taught a music class. [...] "These are schools where the kids look down at their feet and have no hope and don't feel like they mean anything. They have no self-worth. They need something. This is not a photo-op and just throwing some money. You really roll your sleeves up and immerse yourself in the school." [...] Smith said.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{though they}} did have a {{following}} in the straight edge community, Government Issue's stylistic expansion from one album to the next alienated much of their early hardcore audience. Blush writes that [...] "Unfortunately, most who went to see G.I. through the 80s still expected to hear hardcore reminiscent of the first EP. The group was moving into a softer, R.E.M. direction, and none of their fans <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> <b>shit</b> <b>about</b> such profound maturity." [...] Huey remarks that the band [...] "has remained somewhat overlooked {{in relation to the}} rest of the D.C. hardcore bands of their time, in part because their music never really fit the proto-emo bent of much of the local Dischord stable", while Burgess notes that they nonetheless [...] "made history in their own way by never fitting into the scene most people naturally associated with their city." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1999, Gurewitz {{reunited with}} Graffin to co-write a song together, called [...] "Believe It", which would appear on their next album, The New America (2000). For it, Todd Rundgren, an early musical {{inspiration}} for Graffin, {{was brought in}} to produce. [...] "Todd was kind of an underground sensation back in 1974. Here's a guy who was making pop music but in a way that you wouldn't hear on the radio. So much of my early musical identity was wrapped up in the way he conducted himself." [...] In the summer of 2000, they set out on a 3-month U.S. arena tour opening for Blink-182. Unfortunately, the experience might not have been all that Greg {{and the rest of the}} band might have hoped. Interest in recording the record waned, due to Rundgren's poor attitude. Jay Bentley reflects on this by saying, [...] "I didn't feel we were going anywhere and so did Greg. Todd didn't like Greg and that made Greg so mad! He met his idol and he was a jerk! I don't think Todd <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> <b>shit</b> <b>about</b> anything." [...] However, Graffin later writes in his book, Anarchy Evolution, that although Todd Rundgren was difficult to work with, he and Graffin are friends to this day. Meanwhile, Bobby Schayer left the band following a serious shoulder injury and was replaced by Brooks Wackerman (Suicidal Tendencies).|$|R
5000|$|The {{starting}} {{budget of}} the film was $3-4 million, though the film's final budget is debatable. Zombie at one point claimed that the film was made solely with the initial $4 million, though in a later interview claimed the film had received a budget of anywhere between $7-14 million. Zombie later admitted that he initially knew he didn't have the funding for a good ending but hedged his bets that if he shot what he could on what remained of his budget, the studio would kick in more funds {{to make a better}} ending. [...] "I knew the ending sucked, so I let it suck and they said, [...] "The movie's great but the ending sucks" [...] and I know. So they gave me more money and we shot a more elaborate ending, bigger sets, the whole razzamatazz." [...] The original film featured more characters, with Zombie mentioning a [...] "skunk ape thing", and featured footage of the four teenagers on their road trip. Universal hoped that the film would focus more on the group of kids, with Zombie stating [...] "nobody <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> <b>shit</b> <b>about</b> the kids".

5000|$|Despite {{receiving}} universal acclaim from critics, Llewyn Davis was panned {{by those}} who experienced the Greenwich Village in the 1960s or knew Dave Van Ronk personally. Folk artist Christie Lavin, a friend of Dave Van Ronk, wrote, [...] "I HATE THIS FILM..."Am outraged that the Coens took such a colorful character and interpreted him as a doofus," [...] in reference to what she viewed as a disrespectful interpretation of the late folk singer. Suzanne Vega, a folk singer who experienced the Greenwich Village of the 1970s and also befriended Dave Van Ronk around the time said, [...] ""I feel they took a vibrant, crackling, competitive, romantic, communal, crazy, drunken, brawling scene and crumpled it into a slow brown sad movie". Dave Van Ronk's ex-wife, Terri Thal, writes [...] "What bothers {{me is that the}} movie doesn't show those days, those people, that world. In the movie, Llewyn Davis is a not-very smart, somewhat selfish, confused young man for whom music is {{a way to make a}} living. It's not a calling, as it was for David and for some others. No one in the film seems to love music. The character who represents Tom Paxton has a pasted-on smile and is a smug person who doesn't at all resemble the smart, funny, witty Tom Paxton who was our best man when we married." [...] In response to some folk singers from the Greenwich Village scene who detested the film's presentation of the Greenwhich Village and the Llewyn Davis character, Aimee Levitt notes that the film is purposely bleak because it is seen through the eyes of a depressed character. She writes, [...] "Nobody <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> <b>shit</b> <b>about</b> his music. His singing partner has just committed suicide. He's alienated all his family and friends and has to hit up strangers to find a place to stay. The whole movie's told from his point of view, and there's nothing, even Pete Seeger leading a big old hootenanny in Washington Square Park, that's going to keep it from looking brown and sad, because that's what the world looks like when you're down in the depression hole." ...|$|R
