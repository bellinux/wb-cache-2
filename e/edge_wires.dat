The local impurity scattering in an arbitrary configuration of conducting and insulating channels is investigated {{and the problem is}} reduced to a single algebraic matrix equation. In particular, the solution to this equation is found for a finite array of chains described by Luttinger liquid models.

50|$|A 3D package (System in Package, Chip Stack MCM, etc.) {{contains}} {{two or more}} chips (integrated circuits) stacked vertically so that they occupy less space and/or have greater connectivity. An alternate type of 3D package {{can be found in}} IBM's Silicon Carrier Packaging Technology, where ICs are not stacked but a carrier substrate containing TSVs is used to connect multiple ICs together in a package. In most 3D packages, the stacked chips are wired together along their edges; this <b>edge</b> <b>wiring</b> slightly increases the length and width of the package and usually requires an extra “interposer” layer between the chips. In some new 3D packages, TSVs replace <b>edge</b> <b>wiring</b> by creating vertical connections through the body of the chips. The resulting package has no added length or width. Because no interposer is required, a TSV 3D package can also be flatter than an edge-wired 3D package. This TSV technique is sometimes also referred to as TSS (Through-Silicon Stacking or Thru-Silicon Stacking).|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} general {{framework}} for solving the stationary nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) on a network of one-dimensional wires modelled by a metric graph with suitable matching conditions at the vertices. A formal solution is given that expresses the wave function and its derivative {{at one end of}} an <b>edge</b> (<b>wire)</b> nonlinearly in terms of the values at the other end. For the cubic NLSE this nonlinear transfer operation can be expressed explicitly in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions. Its application reduces the problem of solving the corresponding set of coupled ordinary nonlinear differential equations to a finite set of nonlinear algebraic equations. For sufficiently small amplitudes we use canonical perturbation theory which makes it possible to extract the leading nonlinear corrections over large distances. Comment: 26 page...|$|R

40|$|Present {{concepts}} {{for solar}} power satellites involve dimensions up {{to tens of}} kilometers and operating internal currents up to hundreds of kiloamperes. A question addressed is whether the local magnetic fields generated by these strong currents during normal operation can shield the array against impacts by plasma ions and electrons (and from thruster plasmas) which can cause possible losses such as power leakage and surface erosion. One of several prototype concepts was modeled by a long narrow rectangular panel 2 km wide and 20 km long.

The wire currents accumulate from zero to 100 kiloamp and are the dominant sources. The magnetic field is approximated analytically.

The density distribution of a trapped cold atom cloud reveals disorder in the trapping potential, which results from meandering current {{flow in the}} wire.

Here, we point out that the <b>edges</b> of microfabricated <b>wires</b> normally exhibit self-affine roughness. We investigate the consequences of this for disorder in atom traps.

40|$|Steel {{manufacturers}} and stockholders prefer bandsawing for cutting off raw materials {{compared to other}} techniques as it enjoys competitive advantages of higher accuracy of cut, better surface finish, lower kerf loss, better straightness of cut, long tool life and high metal removal rate. Along with the geometries of the bandsaw tooth, bandsaw cutting edge condition (e. g., edge sharpness and burr) significantly affects the cutting performance of a bandsaw. Currently the production of bandsaw is largely done by milling operation due to the scale of manufacturing and the economics of milling compared to other processes (e. g., grinding). Ideally, the bandsaw teeth should possess sharp cutting edges with no burr. In general, two types of burr are commonly seen in the bandsaw teeth manufactured by milling operation namely tooth tip burr and side burr. Current research undertaken at Northumbria University in collaboration with a major bandsaw producer {{is focused on the}} mechanism of burr formation in the bandsaw teeth. This paper briefly outlines the factors affecting the burr formation in bimetal (High Speed Steel <b>edge</b> <b>wire</b> and soft steel backing material) bandsaw teeth manufactured by milling process and suggests the necessary steps to be considered for manufacturing burr free bandsaw with sharp cutting edges. The investigation showed that flank wear in the milling cutter has a major influence on the side burr formation in the bandsaw teeth, whereas tooth tip burr was influenced by both flank wear and ''V'' type notch wear found at the crossover point on the flank face. It was also concluded that TiN coating on the milling cutter could control the burr formation in bandsaw teeth to some degree...|$|R

The results help us further understand the nature of the fluctuation and predict the possible application in the precise measurement. Comment: 6 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
50|$|Some high-security safes {{use what}} is called a glass relocker. It is a piece of {{tempered}} glass mounted between the safe door and the combination lock. It has wires attached to the <b>edges.</b> These <b>wires</b> lead to randomly located, spring-loaded bolts.

To drill a safe with a glass relocker, side, top, or rear drilling may be necessary. Many modern high-security safes also incorporate thermal relockers in conjunction with glass-based relockers (usually a fusible link as part of the relocker cabling), which also activate when the temperature of a safe exceeds a certain level as a defense against torches and thermal lances.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Commercially pure Al wires {{are drawn}} through equal channel angular dies with {{simultaneous}} torsion. The wires are deformed {{up to an}} equivalent strain of 1 to 4 at room temperature after several passes. The microstructure evolution of the wires is investigated using optical microscopy at both longitudinal and transverse cross sections. A grain refinement to a mean grain size of 10 to 15 µm is achieved by using this process. Finer grain structure is observed at the edge area of the wires due to the non-uniform strain distribution. The micro-hardness measurement indicates that the hardness distribution is inhomogeneous and increasing from a minimum value at the wire centre to a maximum value at the <b>wire</b> <b>edge.</b> Finite element (FE) results show that by using a channel angel of 160 ° and an initial wire diameter of 4 mm during one pass, an equivalent plastic strain of about 0. 4 at the wire centre and 0. 9 at the <b>wire</b> <b>edge</b> can be achieved. The most important advantage {{of this process is}} the ability to impose continuous severe plastic deformation to wires. This new hybrid process could be used as an industrial method for continuous grain refinement of wires...|$|R
