40|$|The lived {{experiences}} {{of young people}} are becoming increasingly marginalised within the narrowly defined curricula of neoliberal contexts. Many young people are also cast within the media according to deficit discourses of youth which contribute to the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> and the limitation of interaction between generations. This article describes a film project in which young people living in an ex-mining community in the midlands of England worked in and with their community to create a representation of where they live. As part of the process, the young film-makers did more than connect to other people’s memories as repositories of information; both as process and as product, their film {{can be seen to}} connect shared narratives of people and place, across time and space. We argue that this project offers a timely opportunity to reflect upon the ways in which we understand learning in and out of English classrooms...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{changes in}} community governance in the contextof negotiations with a mining company. We focus on three issues:the {{role played by}} the community government on the regulation ofcommunity resources and territory, the diverse and complex intereststhat emerge in the presence of mining activity; and, the communityas a political institution confronting external pressures over its land. We develop a study case focusing on the negotiation process betweenthe Michiquillay peasant community and Anglo American MiningCompany in Cajamarca, Peru. This information was obtained doingfieldwork in the community in 2009. In our analysis we observe thatchanges on community resources regulation, its uses and valorization,as well as changes on the balance of power between economicand political actors, have created a greater level of complexity in thecommunity, creating new levels <b>of</b> <b>community</b> decision and spaces fordisputing resources’ control.

40|$|Using the Philadelphia-based {{organization}} Media Mobilizing Project {{as a case}} study, {{this article}} argues for a more sophisticated understanding of social movement networks. We argue that the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> the neoliberal city has increased the saliency of networked-based organizing. Contrary {{to much of the}} existing scholarly literature, however, we argue that such networks combine horizontal and vertical forms of organization, as well as online and offline media. Networks are not purely horizontal, nor are new media necessarily the best or most natural apparatus for developing networked social movements. Instead, we argue, radio and video may be better suited to connecting poor people in today 2 ̆ 7 s cities. We also shift the locus of analysis away from transnational networks to local ones. While the <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> and isolation <b>of</b> the poor can be found across a range of deindustrialized cities in the United States and globally, the effect of deindustrialization and neoliberalism is asymmetrical. This difference gives the specifics of particular locations greater saliency in scholarly analysis. The local network reveals a three-dimensional political and organizational response that joins the contemporary urban landscape with the contemporary media landscape...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} much recent {{interest}} in generative models for graphs. The intuition behind the study of such link prediction functions is that they provide a succinct description of {{the process by which}} networks grow and evolve: a model that accurately predicts small-scale actions such as coauthorships should help us understand the global properties of the network. Previous work in social network analysis, such as Liben-Nowell and Kleinberg [5], has often focused on generative models that take into account only the graph structure of the network, without making any use of the individual properties of the nodes themselves. Frequently, however, much richer data is available than the link structure alone, such as text documents for coauthorship networks. In this paper, we propose a generative model for documents that produces both text and authors based on a notion <b>of</b> <b>communities,</b> which each have a distribution over authors and over topics. We demonstrate this model on the proceedings of the NIPS conference, showing improved likelihood of held-out coauthorship data. Discovering latent structure can also be useful in analyzing long term trends, such as the growth and <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>communities...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Concentration of {{knowledge}} work in cities generates innovations entailing economic development. This paper addresses {{the challenge of}} turning around the present trend of urban sprawl toward the concentrated knowledge work in cities. The assumption is that dislocation of office and residential housing entailing longer commuting mileage is {{the main cause of}} urban sprawl. Methods: The life cycle costs method is used for comparison of office systems. The present offices system is compared to the concentrated mega offices system outside cities, as well as the local and home offices within cities. The life cycle costs are assessed with statistical data on space, materials and energy, and information services. These are the main resources of the offices systems given labor and capital. Results: Commuting costs about 22 % of the annual average wage and causes congestion, <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> districts, health risks and pollution. These high costs can be reduced by changes in the office systems. The present office system with commuting adds 40 % to the average labor costs. The innovative office systems reduce these costs by 15 to 28 % of the present offices. Sensitivity analyses underpin the findings for nearly all urban conditions. The local office systems are particularly cost-effective. The local office system can also save nearly 78 % energy and reduce 74 % CO 2 emission of the present offices along with less space use. Congestion, as well as <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>communities</b> and nature caused by commuting can be avoided. Conclusions: Some project developers invest in the distributed offices. Policies encourage such investments if they reallocate funds from infrastructure into refurbishing of the available housing and internalize the external effects of land use in the costs of real estate development. These policies increase smartness of cities, reduce energy use, and improve living qualities in cities...|$|R

The researcher aims to develop a culturally sensitive psycho-social approach to address alcohol use among children.

The research was qualitative in nature and through semi-structured interview schedules the researcher was able to gain insight in the area of substance use amongst children in the rural areas of the Eastern Cape Province.

40|$|The {{power of}} the concept of ethnic and {{national}} identity has again become brutally evident in recent years, as ethnonationalism has contributed to tearing apart countries and interethnic strife has erupted into bloody conflict in a growing number of locations across the world – from Rwanda and Congo to ex-Yugoslavia and the Caucasus and China. The major powers have seemed impotent to resolve these crises, and the term "ethnic cleansing " has entered our vocabulary. The anticipated peace and "new world order " following the end of the Cold War have become a dream unfulfilled rather than a reality, as the lifting of superpower constraints in both Europe and parts of the developing world has enabled nationalistic rhetoric, nationalism, interethnic conflict, and even genocide to surface once again. Ethnonationalism is not a new phenomenon, yet its spread {{since the end of the}} cold war has become a more salient challenge both to the integrity and sovereignty of states and to the stability of regions and, perhaps, the international system itself.
