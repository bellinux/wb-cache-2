5000|$|In August 2010 he escaped, by tearing {{a hole in}} {{the wire}} fence around the low {{security}} clinic, apparently using his bare hands. He then illegally crossed the border to Norway in a boat and met with Norwegian reporters. While wearing Nazi symbols, he told the reporters that he was [...] "not a nationalist, but a racist". Joined by two neo-Nazis from [...] "an ex-Soviet Baltic state" [...] living in Norway, he appeared at the International Police Immigration Service in Oslo on September 21, 2010, where he handed in a loaded weapon, declared himself a [...] "white warrior" [...] and requested political asylum. As a result, the police searched their tattoo shop where they found five illegal handguns and an <b>entrance</b> <b>card</b> stolen from the Norwegian Armed Forces. Nazi paraphernalia including a large doll dressed up as a Nazi was found near the front entrance of the shop. The newspaper interviewed residents near the tattoo shop who claimed they 'often heard loud noise, screaming and banging'. The neighbors also stated they would occasionally see the occupants of the tattoo shop 'practicing fighting and boxing while completely naked'. All three were then jailed, while the case is being investigated. On October 18 Russian authorities sent an extradition request to Norwegian authorities.|$|R
5000|$|The set is {{constructed}} {{to resemble a}} typical public library. A team of six players sits at a study table, three on each side, with host Zero Kazama sitting nearby at the circulation desk next to the <b>entrance.</b> Six <b>cards</b> are placed facedown on the table, and each player picks one and flips it over. Typically, five of the cards are green and marked [...] "Safe"; the sixth, which is yellow and marked with a black skull and crossbones, means that its holder must endure a bizarre [...] "punishment" [...] challenge. In some cases during the second season, {{five of the six}} cards show the skull and crossbones, leaving only one player safe.|$|R

She then played in the Rogers Cup and lost to Samantha Stosur in the second round. She {{received}} a wild <b>card</b> <b>entrance</b> to the Pilot Pen Tennis tournament in New Haven, but lost in the quarterfinals to Mauresmo. This became her last tournament as 1st seeded. At the US Open she won in straight set wins over Görges, Sevastova, and Peer, but lost against Caroline Wozniacki in the fourth round. At the Toray Pan Pacific Open in Tokyo, seeded fifth, she lost to Andrea Petkovic.|$|R
5000|$|Not being {{a native}} speaker of Chinese, Lin {{sometimes}} reacted {{more slowly than}} his fellow soldiers to commands, earning him {{a reputation as a}} [...] "bungler", in his own words. Other than that, however, he describes his experiences as being quite similar to the generations of draftees before him. After boot camp, he was assigned to a unit based in Miaoli County. Like other fresh boot camp graduates, he experienced some hazing from senior soldiers. He served on guard duty at the base's <b>entrance,</b> checking identity <b>cards</b> and on one occasion coming into contact with a superior officer surprised to see a white man serving in the army. He was later promoted to corporal, and took on lighter duties at the brigade headquarters. He was honourably discharged from the army in early 1998.|$|R
40|$|Libraries {{staff was}} faced with {{developing}} an ongoing instruction program for using a second online public access catalog. At this point UCF was in transition from CLSI, which {{had served as a}} catalog andcirculation system to NOTIS’s public access catalog, LUIS. In this phaseof the library’s transition, the users found two clusters of different catalog terminals, side-by-side, near the building’s <b>entrance</b> and no <b>card</b> catalog. LUIS was to be the library’s catalog while CLSI was to remain the library’s circulation system. The CLSI system, in use since 1982, featured remote access and traditional access points (author, title, subject) to bibliographic records. LIJIS could be considered UCF’s second generation catalog (Hildreth, 1987), since it featured authority files and access to holdings of eight other university libraries, in addition to traditional catalog records and access. Presently (Summer 1988), the number of LUIS terminals available to the public has increased. The number of CLSI terminals has been reduced, relocated to a less visible area, and labeled as “circulation information. ” The transition to the NOTIS circulation module is being studied, but no definite date for implementation has been determined...|$|R
5000|$|CVHS's Baseball Club is the school's most successful, {{high-profile}} sport. The 2009 baseball team, following {{more than}} 25 years of tradition, defeated ESISON High School 1-0 in the CIF Championship game played at Angel Stadium to capture CVHS's 6th CIF Championship in baseball. The CVHS Varsity Baseball Club has been coached by Robert [...] "Bob" [...] Zamora since the school opened in 1977. Coach Zamora {{is also known}} as Coach [...] "Z" [...] by current and former players. The Cougars are a perfect 6-0 in CIF Championship games and have won CIF Titles in each decade since the 1980s. The Cougar baseball program's dominance of prep baseball in Southern California started with the capturing of the school's first CIF Championship in 1983. CIF Championships were also captured by the 1987, 1991, 2000 & 2001 squads. The 1987 team remains the standout team in the school's history, posting a school best 27-3 record. The 1991 title was obtained by a Wild <b>Card</b> <b>entrance</b> into the CIF Playoffs and the 2000 & 2001 squads were the first CIF back to back title winners in school history. The baseball team has also had a penchant for turning out many college scholarships athletes and professionals as well as one U.S. Olympian (Don August 1984).|$|R
40|$|Normative {{requirements}} {{according to}} that descriptions of vibroemitters(VE) are checked for standard steel mass do {{not take into account}} all variety of building constructions, on that VE set. Different constructions("heavy" are walls, ceiling, ???? etc.; "easy" constructions are windows, sanitary engineering systems, air-ducts etc.) are required for effective noise masking by the different levels of noise vibroacceleration. Taking into account productive variation of parameters of VE expediently at an entrance/weekend control of indexes of setting of VE to distribute on groups depending on the level of the vibroacceleration developed by them on standard mass. The similar differentiated going near verification of VE allows in a number of cases substantially to promote such important productive index, as "percent of exit suitable", and at creation of complex TZI substantially to decrease temporal and ??????????? expenses on his creation. A task of development of such methodology of verification of ??, that would be realized by means of accessible facilities of personal computer(PC) and corresponding public domain software) and here on efficiency of selection of suitable VE would not yield to the traditional methodology, based on application of standard equipment of audio-noise meter (ANM) enters in the complement of that. The offered methodology can be realized by means of stand, in that checked up VE connected to the exit of vibroacoustic generator passes a vibration directly VD, that is used in the mode of direct piezo-effect. Thus the construction of stand provides a reliable direct mechanical contact between the working surfaces of VD and checked up VE. A signal acting from the exit of VD directly to the <b>entrance</b> of sound <b>card</b> PC allows to look after in the window of the program of spectrum analyzer circumflex spectrum of output signal of VD. On a location this circumflex spectrum in relation to the border of the field of admittance("borders from" below) concluded about the state of capacity of checked up VE. The border of the field of admittance is beforehand inflicted on the working field of window of the program of spectrum analyzer and fixed there. An offer methodology was approved at verification of party of VE, passing tests with the use of standard measuring facilities(complete set of ANM and standard steel mass). Comparison of the results got in both cases showed that data of tests of VE by means of an offer methodology and data of tests of VE by means of traditional methodology coincided fully. Therefore there are grounds to suppose that an offer methodology of verification of capacity of VE (taking into account relative simplicity and cheapness of her realization) {{can be used in a}} number of cases for operative diagnostics of VE both in the conditions of production(for example, at output control of producer) and for a consumer(as entrance control). ??????????? ??????????, ???????? ??????? ?????????????? ????????????????
