5|$|She {{moved to}} BAM Racing in October 2001 and drove her first (and only) {{race in the}} NASCAR Winston West Series (now called K Pro Series West) at Las Vegas Motor Speedway that same month. Robinson {{was sent to a}} driving school to {{familiarize}} herself with the track, and Kranefuss granted her permission to race. She retired due to a car failure while running in third position. Team owner Tony Morgenthau first noticed Robinson at an ARCA race at Pocono Raceway the previous year when she made contact with his driver Matty Mullins who was sent into the wall. He had been impressed with <b>her</b> <b>pace</b> at Las Vegas. He spoke to Robinson after the race and asked her why she had not competed in more events. He later offered her a multi-year contract which she signed in December 2001. Her crew chief was former Busch Series driver Eddie Sharp. She attempted to qualify for 24-races during the 2002 season since her team had no owner points because they were a new operation. Robinson went to Kranefuss to terminate her contract with his team. She ran for the Rookie of the Year award, but was seen by the Chicago Tribune as having little chance of securing the honor.|$|E

However, Liddell couldn't get any further breakthroughs, and even though England lost Connor and Edwards to Fitzpatrick - both lbw - Arran Brindle batted out an hour for 24 not out to see England to the target about three hours before the {{scheduled}} close.|$|E
25|$|A small, quick, yet {{sturdy and}} {{tenacious}} player, who is regarded {{by many in}} the sport as the greatest female footballer of all time, Marta is renowned for her flair, quick feet, and exceptional skill on the ball, which has earned her comparisons with Ronaldinho, Romário, and also Pelé, who himself dubbed her as Pele with skirts. In addition to her vision and technical skills, Marta is also known for <b>her</b> <b>pace</b> when dribbling at speed. Marta is capable of playing in several offensive positions: she began her career in an offensive midfield role as a classic number 10, although she was later deployed in a more advanced role, both as a supporting forward and as a main striker, or even on the wing, a position which allows her to cut into the middle and shoot on goal with her stronger left foot. Although she is primarily known for her creativity, chance creation, and ability to play off of her teammates as an advanced playmaker, Marta is a prolific goalscorer, who is renowned for her striking ability; she is also accurate from penalties and set-pieces. In addition to her footballing abilities, Marta has also stood out for her leadership.|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} verse, Beyoncé sings to the [...] "sexual teasing" [...] lyrics, which are {{addressed}} to the men looking at her: [...] "I can be a tease, but I really wanna please you [...] Oohhh you watchin me shake it, [...] Ya can't take it, it’s blazin ...". The chorus lines; [...] "Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight" [...] are sung in a very quick and breathless manner by Beyoncé. Bret McCabe noted that <b>her</b> <b>pace</b> could be {{compared to that of}} American singer Donna Summer. Slim Thug appears again after the second verse to perform another different verse rap: [...] "I’m checking on you boo, do what’chu do / And while you dance I’ma glance at this beautiful view / I’m keep my hands in my pants, I need to glue ’em with glue ...". Before the song ends, Beyoncé repeats the chorus lines four times as additional vocals of hers are played in the background.|$|E
500|$|Two {{months prior}} to the Olympics, Lynch went to North America and competed in World Cup races in Canada and the United States. She then competed in the 1996 pre-Olympic cycle tour, winning one of the stages. Once she arrived at the Olympic Village in Atlanta, she was underwhelmed by the support she {{received}} from the cycling team; most had never been to a mountain bike event. The team jersey was unsuitable for the heat and humidity. Her new bike had a hole in the bottom bracket and the neutral tech support insisting that she couldn't ride it. Her old frame was couriered over with two days to spare. Life in the village was unpleasant due to constant security checks, and athletes who had completed their event partying all night. Lynch moved out and shared accommodation with Jacqui Nelson in a suburb. Whilst this required a two-hour bus ride to the mountain bike venue, it made for a more pleasant stay and sufficient sleep. The mountain bike course overlapped with the equestrian venue and was not open for mountain bike training until two days prior to the race. Lynch ignored this and promptly ran into an American army unit looking for bombs and was arrested. After an hour's detention, one of the mountain bike officials verified that she was a competitor. The race day, 30 July, was the hottest of the Olympic Games, and the [...] laps were reduced to [...] Lynch settled into fifth place in the first lap, but crashed on one of the corners. A few riders went past and she continued in 12th place. In the third lap, the heat became unbearable, but Lynch had a CamelBak with frozen drink; one of the few riders to do so. She kept <b>her</b> <b>pace</b> as other riders struggled. She finished 8th, with two previous world champions behind her (Juli Furtado in 10th, and Silvia Fürst in 16th).|$|E

2500|$|In 2016, Savchenko left Batkivshchyna, but {{remained}} {{a member of}} its parliamentary faction. This was announced on 12 December 2016 right after Savchenko had admitted she had recently held a secret meeting with separatist leaders Aleksandr Zakharchenko (of the Donetsk People's Republic) and Igor Plotnitsky (of the Luhansk People's Republic) in Minsk. On 15 December 2016, Batkivshchyna expelled Savchenko from its parliamentary faction in response to her Minsk meeting with Zakharchenko and Plotnitsky. The party saw this meeting as [...] "negotiations with terrorists" [...] and [...] "adamantly opposed" [...] it. Following this controversy, the Ukrainian parliament stripped Savchenko of <b>her</b> <b>PACE</b> membership on 22 December 2016. On 27 December 2016, Savchenko established the Civic Platform RUNA (an acronym for Ukrainian People's Revolution). According to Savchenko RUNA {{will not be a}} [...] "political project" [...] but rather a [...] "mechanism" [...] and a [...] "natural association of people" [...] who do not follow [...] "populist slogans." [...] In July 2017 her new political party [...] "Social and Political Platform of Nadiya Savchenko" [...] was officially registered. The same month she stated her intent {{to take part in the}} 2019 Ukrainian presidential election.|$|E
2500|$|Number one Maria Sharapova {{continued}} easily {{moving through}} the draw after surviving her Day 2 scare due to heat. [...] She defeated 30 seed Tathiana Garbin 6–3, 6–1. [...] Her opponent in the fourth round would be fellow Russian Vera Zvonareva, who surprisingly defeated number 13 Ana Ivanovic soundly 6–1, 6–2. [...] Australian fan favourite Alicia Molik won her first set 6–3 against Swiss Patty Schnyder on Rod Laver Arena, but could not continue <b>her</b> <b>pace,</b> as Schnyder won 3–6, 6–2, 6–0. [...] Number 4 Kim Clijsters defeated Alyona Bondarenko 6–3, 6–3 in a quick match. [...] Number 6 Martina Hingis continued the great play of her comeback, winning 6–2, 6–1 against Aiko Nakamura. [...] Clijsters, Hingis, and Schnyder will all benefit from playing on the roofed courts during the rain experienced on Day 6, as their opponents on Day 8 will have to play on Day 7 as well. [...] The matches delayed by rain were: #9 Dinara Safina v #16 Li Na, #12 Anna Chakvetadze v Jelena Kostanić Tošić, and #15 Daniela Hantuchová v Ashley Harkleroad. [...] The winners of those matches would play Hingis, Schnyder, and Clijsters, respectively. [...] The roofed centre courts are always seen as an unfair advantage to the top players or the home country players, as {{they are able to}} complete matches on days affected by rain or heat, whereas their opponents are delayed and face playing on back-to-back days.|$|E
2500|$|The Guardian said [...] "despite {{the usual}} collaborators, it is Ciara's {{presence}} that is stamped {{firmly on the}} album. Evidence that she is an under-rated balladeer {{comes in the form}} of [...] "Keep Dancin' on Me", a shimmering slow jam, and the morning-after existential haze of [...] "I Don't Remember", but a terpsichorean swagger remains at the heart of Ciara's world. Few artists go as hard as she does on her club jams, whether inviting the world to 'kiss my swag' over kinetic freestyle beats on [...] "Pucker Up", combining outraged soprano braggadocio with thunderous crunk baselines on the broiling [...] "High Price" [...] or gliding smoothly through the delectable, sun-kissed [...] "Echo". At her best, <b>her</b> <b>pace</b> is furious, and keeping up is exhilarating." [...] Digital Spy gave it three out of five stars and commented that [...] "Fantasy Ride features much the same cast of producers as countless other R albums from the last couple of years, but these A-list knob-twiddlers rarely try anything risky or inventive here. However, this isn't to say that Fantasy Ride is a bad album. It actually offers a consistently sexy listen with enough minor triumphs – [...] "Love Sex Magic", [...] "Turntables" [...] and the electro-scuzzy [...] "Pucker Up" [...] – to hold your attention. Ciara, meanwhile, is on a seductive form throughout. Ciara's Fantasy Ride deserves the benefit of the doubt." [...] However, Billboard gave it an average review, stating, [...] "On 'High Price,' where she takes her vocals to an opera-like pitch, and her collaboration with the-Dream, 'Lover's Things,' whose faint tenor would seem like an ideal match, Ciara seems to go almost unnoticed. Thankfully, 'Work,' featuring Missy Elliott, has Ciara showing fly-girl antics over a house-like, clap-laden production, and the breakup song 'Never Ever,' featuring Young Jeezy, which samples 'If You Don't Know Me by Now,' pick up the slack." [...] In his Consumer Guide, however, Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "dud" [...] score (...) [...]|$|E

2500|$|MSN Music {{picked the}} album as Album of the Week and praised it with four-out-of-five star review, noting: [...] "It {{may be a}} cliché, but Jones has proven that heartbreak makes good music." [...] Jim Farber of New York Daily News was also {{positive}} about the album, writing it shows [...] " [...] undeniably darker Norah than we've heard before", {{and gave it a}} four-out-of-five-star review, opining that: [...] "True to its title, Little Broken Hearts amounts to an end-of-the-relationship concept album, told {{from the point of view}} of a woman in full control of her poisonous feelings. Unsurprisingly, Jones went through a break-up right before creating the music. To seal the mood, she came up with a sound as broodingly coherent as the soundtrack to a domestic drama." [...] The Washington Post positive, highlighting the opening track of the record, [...] "Good Morning" [...] and said: [...] "Thematic albums are increasingly rare these days, good ones rarer still. Jones and Burton pull it off." [...] Boston Globe praised the album, saying: [...] "There are enough good musical ideas here to keep the mind from wandering, and it brings her squarely into contemporary pop without sounding contrived." [...] Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune gave it a three-out-of-four star review and said: [...] "There are enough good musical ideas here to keep the mind from wandering, and it brings her squarely into contemporary pop without sounding contrived." [...] musicOMH was positive, giving the album four-out-of-five stars and praised the team for the collaboration and remarked: [...] "The team assembled here have done something quite remarkable, and this new-found partnership between Jones and Burton could perhaps lead to some very fine collaborations on future albums." [...] Rolling Stone reviewer Will Hermes said [...] "her [...] fifth album is a brand-rejigging songwriting collab with Brian [...] "Danger Mouse" [...] Burton that both picks up <b>her</b> <b>pace</b> and pumps up her palette," [...] awarding it three-and-a-half stars out of five and closed the review with: [...] "even good girls need revenge sometimes." [...] Enio Chiola of PopMatters also gave a positive review of the album, scored it as seven out of ten, praised Jones for her writing skill and said: [...] "Instead of picking apart the tracks that work best, the entire album plays like a cohesive whole, somehow frayed and fragmented if not left intact." [...] Spins review was very positive, scoring it as eight out of ten and writing: [...] "Little Broken Hearts is exciting because it explores the darkest corners of betrayal, bad love, and jealousy with enough vitality to propel Jones out of the bloodless purgatory of brunch music." [...] Andrea Warner of Exclaim! was also very positive, noting: [...] "This Norah Jones is damaged, dangerous and vulnerable, and Burton's mastery of sound helps deepen the relationship between listener and song." ...|$|E
