5|$|Hemimetabolous insects, {{those with}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis, change gradually by undergoing {{a series of}} molts. An insect molts when it outgrows its exoskeleton, which does not stretch and would otherwise restrict the insect's growth. The molting process begins as the insect's epidermis secretes a new epicuticle inside the old one. After this new epicuticle is secreted, the epidermis releases a mixture of enzymes that digests the <b>endocuticle</b> and thus detaches the old cuticle.

The morphological {{changes in the}} cuticle and surface of the cuticle-removed cortex were observed by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). When human hair was treated with dehydrated 5 % KOH/ 1 -butanol at 50 øC, {{the boundary between the}} exo- and <b>endocuticles</b> in a few outer layers became obscure at first, and the thickness of a layer decreased with the simultaneous dissolution of the outermost layer. The obscurity of boundary was also observed even in the inner layers with the thickness kept unchanged. The dissolution proceeded from the outer to inner cuticle layer successively, with the complete disappearance of the boundary between exo- and <b>endocuticles</b> in the inner layer. The surface of the untreated and descaled hair was examined by means of FT-IR in diffuse reflectance measurements. FT-IR microspectroscopy was also employed to measure inside the cortical cells. The appreciable changes in spectrum were observed for the surface of the descaled hair in the region from 1000 cm- • to 1100 cm-•. There was no change in the spectrum inside the cortex. These findings indicated that longer treatment with KOH/ 1 -butanol led to some modification of disulfide and SH groups {{on the surface of the}} cortex, but that it did not penetrate deeply into the cortex...|$|R
40|$|The {{swimming}} crab Liocarcinus depurator (L.) {{is a common}} member of the benthic fauna in Scottish waters, and is often caught as bycatch from the common lobster fishery grounds. This study aims to employ the species {{in relation to the}} biomonitoring potential for Mn in the Scottish inshore waters and in UK monitoring programmes by choosing Loch Fyne in the west coast of Scotland as a naturally high Mn area and the Clyde Sea area as the reference area. The ability of the crushed carapace to remove Mn from aqueous solution in a biosorption column system in the remediation of contaminated waters was also investigated as an attempt to turn this un-commercial species into beneficial use. Measured using standard atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), the concentrations of Mn in the tissues of the {{swimming crab}} L. depurator from Loch Fyne were consistently higher than in the tissues in crabs from the Clyde Sea area. The metal concentration differed according to sexes, and to the tissues in the order of the exoskeleton (carapace, gills) > hepatopancreas > crusher claw muscle and gonads. The trend observed in L. depurator was comparable to the shore crab, Carcinus maenas which is an established biomonitor for metals collected within the vicinity of both study areas. A series of different exposures of L. depurator to Mn in sea water (10 ppm and 20 ppm) for up to 21 d, followed by a depuration period of 47 d were performed under controlled laboratory conditions. Temporal changes in Mn concentrations in the exoskeleton of individual crabs were monitored by autotomizing a walking leg at weekly intervals. Mn concentrations in other tissues at given sampling points were obtained by sacrificing a batch of crabs at each sampling time. The hard tissues (dorsal carapace and leg exoskeleton) irreversibly accumulated Mn from the water whereas the soft tissues both accumulated Mn when exposed, and eliminated Mn after a period of depuration in clean sea water. As a result, the use of the exoskeleton of autotomized legs to represent Mn accumulation in the whole exoskeleton of a crab was established, and the accumulation of Mn from the water into the crabs tissues particularly the exoskeleton was confirmed. The ability of dried and crushed carapace particles from the swimming crab L. depurator to remove Mn from aqueous solutions was studied using a packed bed up-flow biosorption column system. From a batch experiment carried out at room temperature on fine carapace particles with a diameter of less than 300 µm and 100 ml of 80 ppm Mn in distilled water, the data fitted the Freundlich adsorption isotherm with an adsorption capacity KF= 22. 82 mg. g- 1. The breakthrough curves generated from a series of up-flow biosorption experiments (constant flow rate of 100 ml. h- 1, 72 h sorption) indicates the great potential of the crab carapace particles to remove Mn from a solution. The removal depended greatly on the initial concentrations of the solution and the amount of carapace particles used which can be expressed as mass or the height of the column beds. Greater column bed heights increase Mn removal capacity which in the columns could be observed visually through progressive colour change of the beds. Experiments repeated using the carapace particles of the Norway lobster, Nephrops norvegicus (L.) generated similar trends and comparable data with the ones observed for L. depurator. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and SEM combined with electron dispersive analysis of x-ray (SEM-EDX) were applied to examine the morphology of the dorsal carapace and gills of L. depurator, and also the form and site of Mn deposition onto both the intact carapace of L. depurator and onto Mn-biosorbed carapace particles. The dorsal carapace of L. depurator resembles the typical crustacean cuticle with three main layers, the epi-, exo- and <b>endocuticles</b> made up primarily by CaCO 3. Mn deposited onto the carapace especially on exposed inner layers and broken edges of the carapace particles in the form of Mn-rich nodules, which in 72 h could create a layer visually observed as blackening of the particles. Deposition onto the gill surface took the form of fine particles scattered on the lamellae. Exposure of an isolated carapace to 80 ppm Mn solution indicated the barrier-effect played by the epicuticle to Mn deposition onto the external surface. This barrier was lost when the surface is abraded. The membranous layer on the internal side did not act as a barrier, and penetration of Mn up to approximately 50 µm into the endocuticular layers was detected. These results correlated with AAS measurements which indicated that internal exposure of the carapace resulted in a three times higher concentrations of Mn compared with external exposure. Based on the wide distribution of L. depurator around the UK coast and its habit of resting on the bottom sediment, {{the results of this study}} propose L. depurator as a biomonitor species for Mn in the bottom water, particularly in the Scottish waters. Given the abundance of the species in common lobster fishery grounds in Scotland and often caught as bycatch in the trawls, L. depurator could provide a continued source of materials if the carapace is to be converted into a good Mn-removing agent in Mn contaminated waters...|$|R

40|$|A {{description}} is given of cells termed lipo-protein {{cells in the}} blood of Carcinus maenas, and of their development from amoebocytes. These cells exhibit a marked cycle of appearance and disappearance correlated with the moult. They appear {{towards the end of the}} instar, reach their maximum development immediately before the epicuticle of the new cuticle is secreted, and disappear soon after the moult. They show positive reactions for the presence of lipids, aromatic substances, tyrosine, and peptide linkages. As the epicuticle and pre-exuvial <b>endocuticle</b> are secreted, the colouring with Sudan black B and the Millon reaction in the cells decrease in intensity. The cells are believed to synthesize lipo-protein or extract it from the haemolymph, and to transport it to the epidermis and thence to the developing cuticle, thus contributing to the secretion of the epicuticle and impregnating the pre-exuvial <b>endocuticle.</b> The lipo-protein cells are compared with the oenocytes of insects and with the granulo-cytes and vacuolar cells or leberidocytes of spiders...|$|E
40|$|Figure 1 - TEM A, G, H, I and STEM B, C, D, E, F micrographs of decalcified and EPON {{embedded}} tergites of Porcellio scaber. A Sagittal overview showing epicuticle (ep), exocuticle (ex), <b>endocuticle</b> (en) and membranous layer (ml), ec, epithelial cell; n, nucleus; sc, epicuticular scale. B Proximal exocuticle. Dense {{network of}} pore canals (pc) containing fibrils or fibres following {{the direction of}} the pore canal. C, D Fibres of the distal exocuticle (dex) consisting of approximately 3 nm thick unstained chitin crystallites (arrowheads) surrounded by densely stained proteins. E, F In the <b>endocuticle</b> single fibrils form the twisted plywood structure. The pore canals contain vertical fibrils or fibres. G, H, I Section through a cuticular thickening. The increase in cuticle thickness is brought about by an increase of the stacking height in the distal exocuticle only.

40|$|In 1994 a {{previously}} unreported rust spot shell disease {{was seen in}} mud crabs Scylla serrata— Forskal from Port Curtis, central Queensland, Australia. Of 673 crabs surveyed, 21. 7 % had shell lesions. Of these, 82. 9 % had rust spot lesions on the carapace. The majority of rust spot-affected crabs (78. 8 %) were female. Rust spot lesions were predominantly non-perforated (89. 4 %) and 54. 8 % were bilaterally symmetrical. There was also a gender difference {{in the areas of}} the carapace most commonly affected. The main histological features of the rust spot lesion included: a cavity in the upper endocuticle; indentation of the <b>endocuticle</b> below the cavity; remains of muscle attachment adhesive epithelium within the cavity; fibrous connective tissue between the damaged carapace andthe attached muscle; and islands of <b>endocuticle</b> in this fibrous connective tissue. Histopathology of the internal organs failed to find evidence of an infectious or parasitic cause of the rust spot lesions. The cause(s) of the syndrome appear(s) to be non-infectious...|$|E
