40|$|In {{order to}} {{identify}} possible risk factors for T. gondii infection in goat herds in Ceará, Brazil, 2362 serum samples were tested by ELISA. The serological prevalence was 25. 1 %. The risk factors identified for Toxoplasma gondii infection in goat herds were age, number of cats, use of wooden <b>feeding</b> <b>troughs</b> and absence of <b>feeding</b> <b>troughs.</b> Goats older than 37 months had 2. 01 (CI 95 %; 1. 55 - 2. 61) higher risk of infection than younger animals. Greater risk of infection was observed in farms with more than 10 cats (OR = 1. 73; CI 95 %; 1. 01 - 3. 33). The use of wooden <b>feeding</b> <b>troughs</b> represented a high probability of infection (OR = 7. 81; CI 95 %; 1. 66 - 36. 67). The lack of <b>feeding</b> <b>troughs</b> also represented a high probability of infection (OR = 5. 50; CI 95 %; 1. 24 - 24. 39) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{basking shark}} (Cetorhinus maximus) and megamouth shark (Megachasma pelagios) are {{two species of}} <b>filter</b> <b>feeding</b> sharks, both {{belonging}} to the order Lamniformes. There are two conflicting hypotheses regarding the origins of <b>filter</b> <b>feeding</b> in Lamniform sharks; {{that there is a}} single origin of <b>filter</b> <b>feeding</b> within Lamniformes, or conversely, the <b>filter</b> <b>feeding</b> adaptations have been developed independently due to different ancestral conditions. Evidence obtained from several studies strongly supports the latter hypothesis. Because evidence suggests that C. maximus and M. pelagios have developed their <b>filter</b> <b>feeding</b> adaptations independently, we expect to see convergent evolution taking place within these two lineages. Geometric morphometric analyses were performed on fossil and Recent teeth of megamouth and basking sharks to determine if there is commonality among tooth shape. The results of the analyses support independently derived <b>filter</b> <b>feeding</b> morphologies and convergent evolution within these two lineages...|$|R

Com o objetivo de se identificarem os fatores de risco associados à presença de infecção por toxoplasmose em rebanhos caprinos no estado do Ceará, Brasil, soros sanguíneos de 2362 caprinos foram testados por meio de ELISA. A prevalência estimada pelo ELISA foi 25, 1 %. Os fatores de risco identificados nas propriedades foram: idade dos animais, número de gatos, comedouro manufaturado de madeira e ausência de comedouro. Em caprinos com mais de 37 meses de idade o risco de estarem infectados pelo T. gondii foi 2, 01 vezes maior (IC 95 %; 1, 55 - 2, 61) que em animais mais jovens. Maior risco de infecção foi observado em fazendas com mais de 10 gatos (OR = 1, 73; IC 95 % 1, 01 - 3, 33).

40|$|<b>Filter</b> <b>feeding</b> of microalgae {{is known}} {{to be a source of}} {{nutrients}} in sponges, but the relationship between sponge morphology and <b>filter</b> <b>feeding</b> rates have not been investigated. The demosponges Haliclona ecbasis, Ophlitaspongia pennata, and Mycale hispida of class Demospongiae are commonly found in the San Juan Islands, and were used in a comparison study of sponge morphology and <b>filter</b> <b>feeding</b> rates. Sponge samples were collected from two sites, one intertidal and one subtidal, and were treated with a microalgae monoculture of Nannochloropsis. Water samples were taken at regular intervals and measured by spectrophotometer at λ 440 nm for absorbance. Post ANOVA statistical analysis samples from the intertidal site were found to not show any variance within species at any collection point. Specimens from the subtidal site failed to produce conclusive data possibly due to contamination of sponges by other organisms inhabiting the sponges or weakness in the methodology. Therefore, the results of this study conclude that the three species Haliclona ecbasis, Ophlitaspongia pennata, and Mycale hispida of class Demospongiae may not have significantly different <b>filter</b> <b>feeding</b> efficiencies even though each species exhibit different morphotypes...|$|R
