[...] CNN also reported on his past support for anti-Semitic and radical organizations and individuals, particularly the Nation of Islam and Louis Farrakhan, but noted they found no anti-Semitic writings or public statements by Ellison, and cited his public rejection of the group [...] "due to its propagation of bigoted and anti-Semitic ideas and statements". The New York Times reported that one of the Democratic Party's biggest donors, Haim Saban, said in his 2016 foreign policy forum that Ellison is [...] "clearly an anti-Semitic and anti-Israel person.” Reporters from the Washington Post, Slate and the Huffington Post have described this as part of a smear campaign against Ellison, and note that Ellison's rivals agreed that Saban should apologize for the comments.

So he spends hours that turn into days that turn into weeks that turn into months that turn into a lifetime of asking himself: Is this really what I’m meant to be doing? Sartre is marking his presence on the Earth, trying to make sense of a situation through writing words, words that will eventually represent his thoughts as if those thoughts were still alive. <b>Does</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense?</b> Sartre thinks. Can a thought have a life of its own? He doesn’t like the words, but he starts to write them down, just in case. Can - ‘scratch’ - a thought – ‘scratch, scratch’ - have a life – ‘scratch, scratch’ - of its own – ‘scratch, scratch, scratch’… Oh no! What is happening? Now we are travelling through time and space. “Losing you Sartre, we are losing you”, flying across an ocean, entering another time zone, no longer in Paris, we’re in New York, and oh my goodness it is, isn’t it, it is Carrie Bradshaw. We see her through an open window, until the camera moves us into the room where we see her typing a script from which the actress Sarah Jessica Parker who plays Carrie in the television series Sex and the City and two subsequent movies, is just about to say the words that will enable us to understand these words represent Carrie’s thoughts, as those thoughts are escaping from somewhere that is deep within her subconscious, some might call it her soul, or others might call it … I don’t know what they might call it, but whatever it is, it is deep, very deep, and it’s late at night, and Carrie is alone in her room with her thoughts. The walls in the apartment are painted blue, an ocean blue, but the shade is very close to Benjamin Moore’s Electric Blue. There’s an undercurrent of white elements in the room, including billowing curtains, ceramic lamps, an old leather armchair and a mid-century credenza with sliding doors that might hide an amount of clutter. Of course Carrie is totally unaware of our presence. “Hmm!” she exclaims, while she continues to click, click, click away at her computer, before she tilts her head to one side, and then to the other “Hold it there, Sarah, beautiful. Now let your eyes drift to one side a little but don’t look at anything. You’re lost in that thought, whatever it is, as you start to lift your arm… no your right arm Sarah, lift your right arm above your head, and move your hand across your forehead, relax your fingers and yes - touch your eyebrow, it might loosen the thought.

40|$|Transcription begins]: Sunday My darling Judson, Honey, I adore you so. Golly, honey, I {{miss you}} so much. The only thought that I have to cheer me up {{is that at}} the end of the ten weeks we’ll be married. Darling, I have so many things to be {{grateful}} to you for. Your love, sweetness, kindness and understanding has completely changed me. Until this last week, marriage to me was a kind of dark shadow. Something that every woman had to go through 2 ̆ 6 tolerate. Can you imagine how awful that was. You probably can’t. I was so happy being in love with you but always in the back of my mind was that awful fear 2 ̆ 6 doubt. Now that’s all gone. I am so relieved 2 ̆ 6 happy now. Honey, I’m so glad that I’m in love with you. Another thing I’m thankful for is this last week. What a difference a week can make. Without that lord only knows what would have happened. Well, you’re at Spence Field now. I hope it’s a good field and that you’ll like it. What time did you get there? You weren’t late were you, honey? Sure hope not. That hospital was some place. Honestly, honey, those nurses were a bunch of absolute morons. They kept giving me ice bags that leaked 2 ̆ 6 they’d forget that they had leaked 2 ̆ 6 leave me for three quarters of an hour with a wet gown (hah, that’s a laugh—those pityful [sic] things they call gowns—Bags—probably burlap at that). I could just feel myself catching cold. This morning, (I’d just gotten to sleep at about six thirty) at the ungodly hour five o’clock one of the morons came in to wake me up—she took my temperature 2 ̆ 6 pulse. Then the parade began. You’d think I was giving away free lunch or something. Had a glass of milk for breakfast 2 ̆ 6 one for lunch. Also managed some pudding 2 ̆ 6 potatoes for lunch. Darling, I love you so. I can’t think of anything except how very much I love you, honey. You are to me everything I love. While we were at the hospital waiting to go home they played “Don’t Fence Me In. ” Gee, I love you so. That song brings back so many memories. I love you so. All the way home I kept seeing things that reminded me of you. We drove down a few streets in Brooklyn that you 2 ̆ 6 I had when we were lost. Then Daddy turned down a street. Remember how we went down the one way street, the wrong way, where the police car stopped us in New York? Daddy went down the same street the wrong way. Gee, honey, I love you so. Then we drove on that highway that you 2 ̆ 6 I always go to New York on. Gee, honey, so many things remind me of you. Golly, Judd, I’ve really got it bad. Honestly, I never knew I could love anyone the way I love you. Golly—Everytime I see you or just hear your voice I love you more. Golly, Sweetheart, it really will be something when we’re married. We really won’t have a friend left. Tonight’s New Year’s Eve. Gee, it would be marvelous to be with you. In the condition I’m in it wouldn’t be so nice but I do love you so. Wasn’t supposed to come home until tomorrow or later but I hate to stay in a hospital. What a way to spend New Year’s Eve. Wonder what you’re doing now honey? It’s six o’clock. Oh, is your time there different from the time here? I hope not. Cause when I’m trying to imagine what you’re doing at a certain time, you won’t be doing it then. Oh, honey, I love you so. Happy New Year, my darling. What a year this has been. Never dreamed when it started that I’d be engaged before the year was over. Honey, I’d better rest for a while. That doctor told me to rest a lot. Well, darling, I’ll write more later. I love you more than anything else in the world. Whatever you do, honey, remember I love you. Please don’t forget to write whenever you can. I love you so. I always think of you 2 ̆ 6 miss you loads. Monday Hello darling— This is sort of a continued story. What a life. My throat is really sore again today. Can’t even talk. Yesterday your mother 2 ̆ 6 Bobbie came down for a few minutes. Must have talked too much then or something because my throat feels as though there was a lump of something there so that I can’t say a word. In a way it’s nice not to be able to talk. Don’t have to listen to what anyone else is saying 2 ̆ 6 can just sit there and day dream about you—But, golly, I keep thinking of the funniest things I’d like to say. Gee, honey, I miss you so. You are so wonderful to be in love with—I’m so glad that you’re the one I’m going to marry. You’ll be the most wonderful person in the whole world. I love you so, Sweetheart. Oh, remember when Daddy announced our engagement 2 ̆ 6 Ronnie wanted to know if that made him a grandfather now? Well, Mother called Sis 2 ̆ 6 Walter (his mother 2 ̆ 6 father) and said that I was in the hospital. Ronnie must have been listening or something because he asked “Is Dottie in the hospital to have a baby. ” He really is rushing things. Honey, I love you so. It’s really pityful [sic]. No matter what I’m doing I think of you constantly. Happy New Year, darling—I hope that next New Year’s Eve we will be together. Golly, honey, we’ll be married then. Honey, please try to get a lot of rest 2 ̆ 6 sleep during these next ten weeks. Don’t lose any more weight. You’ll have to take care of yourself. Someone has to be healthy in our family. Harry James is playing, “I’m Beginning To See The Light. ” I like it. Just played “Stareyes. ” That’s a good song too. Gee, honey, there are so many things I’d like to say to you. Try to tell you how much I love you and miss you but there aren’t enough words, I guess. Hope that you can read this but I’m lying down 2 ̆ 6 it’s some angle to write from. Honey, I wonder if I’ll ever be sure of you. I can’t explain how I feel 2 ̆ 6 I’ll probably say the wrong thing 2 ̆ 6 give you the wrong impression—But, I just can’t believe that you love me. It’s too good to be true. It just doesn’t seem possible—was thinking about it last night for the longest time and should have written it then when my thoughts were clear. You’re going to be getting terribly conceited but, honey, you’re just perfect—I can’t find one thing that I don’t like about you. Physically you’re perfect. You’re good looking 2 ̆ 6 tall 2 ̆ 6 dark 2 ̆ 6 have beautiful eyes and curley [sic] hair. You’re nice 2 ̆ 6 strong. Mentally you’re perfect, too. You’ve got ability—talent and loads of brains 2 ̆ 6 you’ve got good sense (most of the time, except when you try to be practical at the wrong times). You have knowledge 2 ̆ 6 can use it when the need arises. You can do just about anything you put your mind to. Besides that you have a marvelous sense of humor. You’re sweet 2 ̆ 6 thoughtful and I love you. Better stop telling you how wonderful you are or there’ll be no living with you. Golly, hon, this time last week, we were eating dinner here. We didn’t want to go to Brooklyn. Golly, suppose we hadn’t gone. Things might have been so different. I don’t know about you but this week made a lot of difference to me. They’re playing “I’m Making Believe. ” That’s what I’ll be doing until you come home. How is this field? Hope it’s nice. Honey, I don’t see how these ten weeks will go fast but everyone seems convinced that they will. To me they’ll seem more like ten years. When do you start flying? What a day. It’s pouring 2 ̆ 6 the wind is blowing. Glad that you’re not at Stewart now. The weather will probably be awful. The doctor said I couldn’t go out for two weeks. Phooey. It will be horrible lying around for two weeks but good for my ankle. Mother wants me to go see Conover 2 ̆ 6 do photography instead of going back to wholesale. Can’t decide whether to do that or not. Honey, gee, you can’t imagine how lonesome it is around here without you. I’d love to have you home just for a few hours so that I could hear your voice, hear you laugh 2 ̆ 6 say “I love you. ” There are so many little things I love about you. Honey, they’re playing “Together. ” All day they’ve been playing all our songs. Especially “Don’t Fence Me In. ” Memories are wonderful things. We were really lucky to have so much time together, hon. Do you get every weekend off? Are you restricted or anything for the first two or three weeks? How was the train trip down? Do you have any Scotch left or am I kidding? I’ve written you two letters so far 2 ̆ 6 will keep them until I hear from you because they’re so long. I’d hate to have anything happen to them before you read them. Finished reading Mrs. Parkington today. She had a pretty good life. It was a very good story. It took me ages to read it because I kept thinking about you. The nurse was going to make me take my ring 2 ̆ 6 bracelet off but I explained I couldn’t 2 ̆ 6 she was very nice 2 ̆ 6 said it would be o. k. to leave them on. Had me worried for a minute though. Have my tonsils in a jar on my dressing table. They were awful the doctor said. Now I’ll probably be o. k. He said they had so much pus in them that they were breaking 2 ̆ 6 going through my system. Well, from now on I should be the picture of health. Honey, have you gotten in touch with Steve yet? Woody is madly waiting for a letter from him. I have been dying to have a long talk with her ever since you told me what happened to see if she is any different. Now I’ll be looking for her to say something while before I wasn’t. The only trouble is that I can’t talk. It’s awful—wonder if she’ll tell me. I doubt it. I’m sure if I had I wouldn’t go around telling anyone. I’ll tell you if anything happens. She’ll probably have to tell someone. Most people do. Honey, the luggage is so beautiful. I’m crazy about it. Gee, I love it. Honestly, honey, I was so surprised. You can’t imagine. The bracelet surprised me too. I wish that I could have surprised you but I knew you wanted the old pen 2 ̆ 6 pencil set. That’s so unromantic, honey. I’m dying to go downstairs 2 ̆ 6 sit 2 ̆ 6 look at my Christmas presents. I really haven’t seen most of them. When I first came in they were what I saw. Your luggage. Honestly, honey, I’m crazy about them. Bobbie just called 2 ̆ 6 yesterday she took home the monkey I got for Ricky. She said it looked like you 2 ̆ 6 was calling it Willy—I’ll have to murder her. Bobbie said if I don’t stop writing this letter I’ll have to send it railway express. Grandmaw said I shouldn’t give the monkey to Ricky because it would scare him—I thought he was cute. You can decide whether to be insulted or flattered when you see “Willy. ” Oh, if anyone down there calls you Bill or any other name that comes from William tell them they’ll have a battle on their hands when I get down there. Judson is such a nice name—I’ve always liked that name—ever since I first met you. I really should end this soon because it will be getting too big for an envelope. Honey, I love you so. Every day I was with you made me love you so much more. How long can this go on[?] Every weekend I was sure that I couldn’t love you any more 2 ̆ 6 yet every weekend I did love you more. That last week was wonderful. It was heaven to be with you so much. Almost as though we were married. We certainly weren’t apart for long. It was wonderful. Honey, how do you feel towards Mickey now? You know me well enough to know that I’m not asking out of jealousy. But when you thought you saw her you looked so strange I didn’t quite know how to interpret that look. Golly, I kept thinking today was Sunday 2 ̆ 6 it’s Monday. We were asleep before I guess. Remember? We were out at the base now. Sinatra’s singing “Night and Day. ” It’s so true. I think of you Night 2 ̆ 6 Day. Honey, I love you so. I’ll never be able to tell you how much. You have such a wonderful way of saying what I mean. <b>Does</b> <b>that</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> to you? But you do. You say what I want to but [can’t] find words for. Now he’s singing “Saturday Night Is the Loniest [sic] Night In the Week. ” Ah, yes. Hope you can read this. I’m just writing whatever comes into my mind 2 ̆ 6 it probably won’t make much sense. I love you. Honey, we won’t ever fall out of love will we, honey? That’s another thing that has worried me. After we’ve been married for a few—(oh, honey, he’s singing “If You Are But a Dream”). (Oh, honey, that’s the first time I’ve heard it since you left. Darling I love you so and miss you terribly. Honey, I hope these ten weeks hurry.) To get back to what I was writing, years to become indifferent to each other 2 ̆ 6 not be in love any more. It won’t happen to us will it, honey? Well, darling—Frankie’s singing “I Dream of You. ” I do—“And I Want You So More than You’ll ever know. ” Hope you like “East Jesus. ” I love you so. Have you started flying yet? What’s it like there? Hope you like it. I love you so. Please write as often as possible. I’ll try to write every day. Probably the rest of my letters won’t be this long, but I’ll try to keep them as long as possible. I love you more than anything else in the world. Goodnight, Sweetheart. I love you. You have all my love forever 2 ̆ 6 always. Dottie P. S. I love you— [Transcription ends...|$|E

30|$|The Mystery Spot is {{a tourist}} {{attraction}} outside of Santa Cruz, California (The Mystery Spot Official Website, n.d.). By constructing a cabin with walls that are perpendicular to a hillside, instead of vertical with respect to gravity, the Mystery Spot creates illusions where balls appear to roll up hill and short people appear taller than tall people. The way the Mystery Spot is constructed breaks the link between visual perception and the proprioceptive and vestibular systems causing objects and environments to appear to have spatial properties <b>that</b> <b>do</b> not <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> in the physical world.|$|R

However, despite all that, whether she is really dense or she acts stupidly on purpose, just to torment Ragamuffin for fun, is unclear, because at times she is shown to be quite intelligent-such as in Vol 2 issue #2, when she verbosely presents Mr.Gosh with various examples of [...] "things she loves more than him" [...] which are quite revolting but quite witty nonetheless.|$|R
40|$|Einstein insisted {{throughout}} his life that the signal achievement of his {{general theory of relativity}} was its general covariance. How are we to reconcile this with the now common view that general covariance merely expresses a definition, our freedom to label events with any set of numbers we like? There is, I believe, a natural reading for Einstein's claims <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>make</b> perfect <b>sense.</b> It requires us to adopt a physical interpretation of relativity theory that is now no longer popular, so the natural reading will no longer have intrinsic interest.

5000|$|On June 5, 2014, Sanford {{introduced}} the TSA Office of Inspection Accountability Act of 2014 (H.R. 4803; 113th Congress), {{a bill that}} would direct the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to review the data and methods that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) uses to classify personnel as law enforcement officers and to reclassify, as necessary, any staff of the Office of Inspection that are currently misclassified according to the results of that review. Sanford said that [...] "even though there are federal standards in place that lay out how employees qualify for higher wages, the Transportation Security Administration pays some of their employees more for jobs they're not <b>doing.</b> <b>That</b> wouldn't <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> anywhere outside of government and our bill would help fix that problem by clarifying those employees' responsibilities." [...] According to Sanford, accurately reclassifying employees who do not spent at least 50 percent of the time on law enforcement activities and putting them on an accurate pay scale would save the government $17 million a year.|$|R

50|$|The {{custom of}} singing Shalom Aleichem on Friday night before Kiddush is now nearly universal, even though certain rabbinical {{authorities}} have expressed misgivings. As {{has been noted}} by Rabbi David Bar-Hayim of Jerusalem, the 18th century Rabbi Jacob Emden in his Sidur Beth Ya'aqov prayer book pointed out many problems regarding this song (addressing requests to angels, expressions <b>that</b> <b>do</b> not <b>make</b> <b>sense,</b> etc.). A similar attitude to the singing of Shalom Aleichem is attributed to Rabbi Elijah, the Vilna Gaon. A further objection, Bar-Hayim explains, is that the song {{is based on a}} literal understanding of an Agadic (homiletic) statement (Babylonian Talmud Shabath 119b) which he views as misguided. Most rabbis, however, do not accept these arguments.|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} of textual and echoic prompts {{was conducted to}} determine which form of prompts was more effective for teaching intraverbal behavior to a 6 -year-old boy with autism. A multiple baseline design across three sets of questions measured (a) the number of full-sentence target answers, (b) partial answers that made sense, and (c) partial answers <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not <b>make</b> <b>sense,</b> or no response, to direct questions asked. A fading procedure using either scripted textual or scripted echoic prompts was employed to evoke the child's correct answers. Although both forms of prompts were effective, results indicated that textual prompts were much more effective. These findings suggest that textual prompts may be effective in teaching complex skills to children with autism...|$|R

30|$|Finally, {{we share}} with Fischer [10, 11] and {{his idea of}} the meta-design. In his approach, it is {{desirable}} that all users in a collaborative design process can express themselves and engage in personally meaningful activities. Users have more power, can override designers’ decisions, and adjust the system according to their interaction needs. In this context, users {{can be seen as}} co-designers, leaving behind the role of mere consumers of technology. The tailoring-based approach, as adopted in this paper, empowers users, for instance, allowing them to change the position of some interaction elements or even disabling functions <b>that</b> <b>do</b> not <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> to them. Moreover, the proposed approach makes it possible to present accessible options as videos in sign language for users who need them or to offer retractile resources to improve efficiency of use for expert users.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{simplification}} algorithm for manifold polygonal meshes of plane-dominant models. Models {{of this type}} are likely to appear in man-made environments. While traditional simplification algorithms focus on generality and smooth meshes, the approach presented here considers a specific class of man-made models. By detecting and classifying edge loops on the mesh and providing a guided series of binary mesh partitions, our approach generates a series of simplified models, each of which better respects the semantics {{of these kinds of}} models than conventional approaches do. A guiding principle is to eliminate simplifications <b>that</b> <b>do</b> not <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> in constructed environments. This, coupled with the concept of “punctuated simplification”, leads to an approach that is both efficient and delivers high visual quality. Comparative results are given.

30|$|A {{different}} kind of problem emerged after preliminary classification tree analyses. The disturbance variables (distance to nearest previous burn in the 1960 s, 1970 s, and 1980 s) gave results <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> ecologically: at some regression splits, greater distances to burned areas were modeled to have higher likelihood of high cheatgrass cover (≥ 10 %), not lower cover, {{as would be expected}} if the previously burned areas were functioning as seed sources. The reason for these results are not obvious, but probably reflect the non-random spatial pattern of previous fires in DINO, and the fact that at least some cheatgrass is present almost everywhere in DINO. We determined that inclusion of these disturbance variables in the final BRT models would obscure rather than enhance the actual patterns of postfire cheatgrass dynamics, and so they were deleted before the final BRT runs.|$|R
40|$|Psychological {{research}} and practice in New Zealand {{has a long history}} of a positivist inspired epistemology and a pragmatic evidence-based approach to therapeutic treatment. There is a growing realization that a more meaningful interface between {{research and}} practice is required to accommodate indigenous Maori knowledge of wellbeing and living. The dominant Western psychological view in New Zealand of world, time, illness and wellbeing results in practices <b>that</b> <b>do</b> not <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> in cultural terms. The medicalisation and classification of psychological disorders cannot account for the degree to which cultural and spiritual factors are associated with problems of living. Heidegger’s analysis of Being and his phenomenological method of understanding these matters ontologically reflect a persuasion not dissimilar to the worldview of the Maori and their notion of wellbeing. It offers some direction to the question of how to better integrate psychological {{research and practice}} in New Zealand.

40|$|An {{approach}} for specifying and executing dynamically adaptive software systems combines model-driven and aspect-oriented techniques to help engineers tame {{the complexity of}} such systems while offering {{a high degree of}} automation and validation. Today’s society increasingly depends on software systems deployed in large companies, banks, airports, and so on. These systems must be available 24 / 7 and continuously adapt to varying environmental conditions and requirements. Such dynamically adaptive systems exhibit degrees of variability that depend on user needs and runtime fluctuations in their contexts. Engineers can develop DASs by defining several variation points. Depending on the context, the system dynamically chooses suitable variants to realize those variation points. These variants may provide better quality of service (QoS), offer new services <b>that</b> <b>did</b> not <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> in the previous context, or discard some services that are no longer useful. DASs range from small embedded systems to large systems of systems and from human-driven to purel...|$|R
