40|$|Abstract- Mechanical {{systems or}} robots to assist {{landmine}} detection {{are expected to}} greatly improve quality of humanitarian demining tasks. These new systems could provide: i) safer operation; ii) advanced methods for automatic target recognition and discrimination; iii) consistent performance with less influence of “human-factors”; iv) better detection performance, i. e., higher probability of detection (POD) and lower false alarm rate (FAR); among others. However, despite many research/development efforts around the world, no practical landmine detection robot has yet achieved maturity for practical use. Nonetheless, the humanitarian <b>demining</b> <b>robot</b> Gryphon, which current status of development is described in detail, is close {{to meet the requirements}} for practical use. This paper analyses the results from latest on-site tests underwent by Gryphon in Croatia (2006, 2007) and Cambodia (2006), to make a critical and objective evaluation of its validity, and clarify the points that still require further development in order to realize a practical humanitarian <b>demining</b> <b>robot...</b>|$|E

40|$|Landmine {{detection}} and removal is a challenging field for researchers. The {{advantages of a}} fully automated approach to this task are obvious, {{but there are many}} technical and economical problems to solve. Most commercially available mobile robots consist of mainly custom made parts. The design and manufacturing of these parts make the robots very expensive. This fact reduces their attractiveness for humanitarian demining, as landmine affected countries cannot support expensive high-tech solution. A <b>demining</b> <b>robot</b> has to be cost effective compared to local labor costs. To cope with these challenges a new 6 wheeled mobile robotic platform is in development. Its geometry has been optimized for rough terrain and obstacle crossing. The robot consists mainly of Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) parts which are easily available at low costs. Using such parts has significantly reduced the overall development time and costs while the reliance on proven-in-use components has increased...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Humanitarian {{demining}} {{is still}} a highly laborintensive and high-risk operation. Advanced sensors and mechanical aids can significantly reduce the demining time. In this context, it is the aim to develop a humanitarian <b>demining</b> mobile <b>robot</b> which is able to scan semi-automatically a minefield. This paper discusses {{the development of a}} control scheme for such a semi-autonomous mobile <b>robot</b> for humanitarian <b>demining.</b> This process requires the careful consideration and integration of multiple aspects: sensors and sensor data fusion, design of a control and software architecture, design of a path planning algorithm and robot control.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} cooperative target searching by groups of autonomous mobile agents. The navigational task is {{to search for a}} target that is a source of a diffusion odour field. We describe a genetically based algorithm (GA) by which multiple agents can locate an odour source more efficiently then a single agent. In previous works the authors have shown the effectiveness implementing animal based strategies in a mobile robot in order to find an odour source in turbulent plumes. This work presents simulation results in searching for an odour source by a swarm of mobile agents coordinated by a GA based strategy. The results of this work can be used for example to coordinate a set of mobile environment monitoring agents in order to find sources of pollution or by a set of <b>demining</b> <b>robots</b> in order to find mined areas...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a {{simulated}} version of a potential demining problem in which robotic minesweepers clear a battle area of anti-tank mines to enable troops to breach the field. The demining problem is modeled as a distributed optimization problem in which the robots strive to minimize an abstract cost function. Robots were simulated using the Java based simulator, TeamBots (www. teambots. org). The <b>demining</b> <b>robots</b> are responsible for clearing a direct vertical path between {{the top and bottom}} edges of the minefield. At each time step, robots must select one of three possible actions: move, scan, or defuse. Each action has a time cost associated with it that represents the relative difficulty of the task for the robot; deactivating mines is not explicitly modeled in the simulation as an actuation task. This problem has characteristics of the consume and graze tasks describe...|$|R
40|$|Many robotic agents use {{color vision}} to {{retrieve}} quality {{information about the}} environment. In this work, we present a visual servoing technique, where vision is the primary sensing modality and sensing {{is based upon the}} analysis of the perceived visual information. We describe how colored targets can be identified and how their position and motion can be estimated quickly and reliably. The visual servoing procedure is essentially a four-stage process, with color target identification, motion parameter estimation, target tracking and target position estimation. These individual parts add up to a global vision system enabling precise positioning for a <b>demining</b> <b>robot.</b> In this work, we present a color target tracking algorithm aimed at robot localization in varying illumination conditions. In our approach a colored target is put {{on the top of the}} robot and a fixed camera is used to detect and track the target. The 3 D robot position can be estimated knowing the camera parameters after an analysis of the camera image. The general setup of this approach is sketched o...|$|E
40|$|Demining and unexploded {{ordnance}} (UXO) clearance {{are extremely}} tedious and dangerous tasks. The use of robots bypasses the hazards and potentially increases {{the efficiency of}} both tasks. A first crucial step towards robotic mine/UXO clearance is to locate all the targets. This requires a path planner that generates a path to pass a detector over all points of a mine/UXO field, i. e., a planner that is complete. The {{current state of the}} art in path planning for mine/UXO clearance is to move a robot randomly or use simple heuristics. These methods do not possess completeness guarantees which are vital for locating all of the mines/UXOs. Using such random approaches is akin to intentionally using imperfect detectors. In this paper, we first overview our prior complete coverage algorithm and compare it with randomized approaches. In addition to the provable guarantees, we demonstrate that complete coverage achieves coverage in shorter time than random coverage. We also show that the use of complete approaches enables the creation of a filter to reject bad sensor readings, which is necessary for successful deployment of robots. We propose a new approach to handle sensor uncertainty that uses geometrical and topological features rather than sensor uncertainty models. We have verified our results by performing experiments in unstructured indoor environments. Finally, for scenarios where some a priori information about a minefield is available, we expedite the demining process by introducing a probabilistic method so that a <b>demining</b> <b>robot</b> does not have to perform exhaustive coverage...|$|E
40|$|Millions of antipersonnel landmines {{are left}} in the ground after past war conicts across many countries. Being {{functional}} for more than 50 years they provide a lot of humanitarian and economical problems long after the conict is _nished. Cleaning the existing mine_elds, called humanitarian demining, is {{required in order to}} return the large areas of the land to normal use and save the local civilians from the danger. Currently, the only fully trustable solution for this problem is the manual clearance which is itself a very dangerous and slow procedure. Automation of the humanitarian demining may change the situation providing a faster approach which eliminates the participation of humans on the mine_eld. This work {{is a part of the}} e_ort toward the development of such approach. Automation of the humanitarian demining meets a lot of technical problems which currently do not have e_ective solutions. This work covers the ones related to the automatic detection of antipersonnel landmines assisted by a mobile scanning platform which carries the landmine detection sensors. The landmine detection approach developed in this work assumes the employing of several nonselective sensors most widely used for landmine detection which include metal detectors, infrared sensors, and ground penetrating radar. The approach has a multi-stage structure and is based on feature-level sensor fusion strategy. This process is understood as a step-by-step reduction of the false alarm rate depending on the quality of the available sensor data. During the _rst stage the sensor data are processed in order to distinguish all objects suspected to be landmines against the background. For this purpose a novel online algorithm was developed. It allows to detect the object during the robot movement and is hardly sensitive to the quality of the sensor data. The consequent stages are performed in order to recognize the landmines among the detected suspicious objects. A number of new classi_cation features were developed in order to perform this recognition. Based on the feature analysis a concept of selective training specially suited for the landmine recognition task was developed. This technique allows to account for the high overlapping of the classes and multimodal distributions of the classi_cation features. Finally, a concept of dominant class was introduced in order to provide high levels of detection rates even in case of poorly separated classes. Being specially designed for the speci_cs of landmine detection the proposed algorithms allow to improve the results. In order to assist the gathering of the sensor data, the problems related to the effective sensor data gathering,path planning and localization of the platform are also addressed. The developed solutions are implemented on the previously created pneumatic scanning platform acting as a prototype <b>demining</b> <b>robot.</b> A number of practical solutions improving the platform localization were developed. The positioning of the robot is based on its odometry, compass and a novel vision system which are combined together by means of a Kalman _lter. The vision system employees a simple CCD camera and is guided by a novel algorithm for the detection and association of natural landmarks found on the ground surface. Finally, considering the landmine detection problem in the scale of mine_eld the problem of the _eld exploration is addressed. Assuming a general case in which the mine_eld may be populated with some obstacles in unknown positions an algorithm for online unknown area coverage was developed. The algorithm guarantees regularity of the robot path necessary for the mapping of sensor data and the safety of the robot by planning its path only inside already covered area. The developed algorithms were implemented in a form of control software for the real platform. Testing of the proposed ideas in simulation and in real conditions (on a test mine_eld) provided promising results showing the perspective of the developed concepts. Based on the experimental results the recommendations for future work are formulated. The automatic landmine detection task raises a number of challenging problems which have connections to other areas of robotics, pattern recognition and control. In this regards the development of the methods proposed in this work was considered in a more broad sense. Thus, the results of this work can be used in the adjacent _elds of robotics: automatic subsurface sensing with online reaction to the found target, pattern recognition in case of poorly distinguished classes, and online unknown area coverage required for cleaning, grass cutting, agriculture, etc. Tese de doutoramento em Engenharia Electrotécnica (Instrumentação e Controlo) apresentada à Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia da Universidade de Coimbr...|$|E
40|$|Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is {{the task}} of de-termining a path that passes over all points of an area or volume of {{interest}} while avoiding obsta-cles.

A considerable body of research has addressed the CPP problem. However, no updated surveys on CPP reflecting recent advances in the field have been presented in the past ten years. In this paper, we present a review of the most successful CPP methods, focusing in the achievements made in the past decade. Furthermore, we discuss reported field applications of the described CPP methods. This work aims to become a starting point for researchers who are initiating their endeavors in CPP. Likewise, this work aims to present a com-prehensive review of the recent breakthroughs in the field, providing links to the most interesting and successful works. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a number of}} complementary algorithms for detecting faults on-board operating robots, where we define a fault as a deviation from expected behavior. Experience has shown that even carefully designed and tested robots may encounter faults [3]. One {{of the reasons for}} this is that components degrade over time. Another is that the operators of the robot rarely have complete knowledge of the environment in which it operates and, hence, may not have accounted for certain situations. In a number of application domains, such as planetary exploration, search and rescue, mine mapping, nuclear waste cleanup, and <b>demining,</b> <b>robots</b> operate in environments where human intervention is expensive, slow, unreliable, or impossible. It is therefore essential for robots to monitor their behavior so that faults may be addressed before they result in catastrophic failures. This monitoring needs to be efficient since there is limited computational power available on robots. Not only are robots venturing into areas inaccessible or dangerous for humans, they are also increasingly becoming a part of day-today life. It is also important for these robots to detect faults in a timely manner, since failure to do so may result in expensive consequences, both monetary and in terms of consumer trust that may be hard to regain. If faults go undetected...|$|R

40|$|While many multi-robot systems rely on fortuitous {{cooperation}} between agents, some tasks, {{such as the}} assembly of large structures, require tighter coordination.

Working as a team, these robots are able to perform a high-precision docking task that none could achieve individually. 1.

40|$|There is a {{large number}} of {{possible}} applications in the field of mobile robotics: Mail delivery robots, domestic or industrial vacuum cleaners, surveillance <b>robots,</b> <b>demining</b> <b>robots</b> and many others could be very interesting products. Despite this potential market and the actual technology, only few simple systems are commercially available. This proves that there are several important and problematic issues in this field, mainly at the intelligence level. As a reaction to the failure of the classical artificial intelligence applied to the field of mobile robotics, several new approaches have been proposed. Artificial neural networks are one of these, and genetic algorithms, supported by the Artificial Life trend, are also getting more and more consideration. These two techniques have already been applied to mobile robotics, but mainly in simulation, and without a final test on a real mobile robot. The use of physical robots for this research seems to be still problematic {{due to the lack of}} efficient tools. Several neural structures for the control of mobile robots have been analysed in this work. All experiences have been carried out on physical robots. To reach this goal, an important effort has been made in order to design new efficient robotic tools. Together with Edo Franzi, André Guignard and Yves Cheneval, we have developed and built hardware and software tools that make an efficient research work possible. Along with several analysis software tools, the mobile robot Khepera has been a result of this development. Using this equipment, six experiences have been carried out, covering a large spectrum of the possible ways neural networks can be used for the control of mobile robots. These experiments have nevertheless been restricted to simple behaviours and small neural networks. The first two experiments show, with a very simple and manually adjusted behaviour, the important role of the interaction of the robot with its environment. The first experiment is based on a collective behaviour, the second on a collaborative one. The adaptation of the robot to the environment is introduced in the third experiment, in which a learning technique is applied. The result is a robot able to learn how to use visual stimuli to avoid particular obstacles. Despite its interesting results, this approach has turned out to be very limited, due to the rigid structure needed. The last three experiments demonstrate the possibilities of the use of genetic algorithms, which proved to be a very flexible adaptation mechanism. The first of these three experiments tests the feasibility of this approach. The second one takes advantage of the characteristics of genetic algorithms to achieve more complex behaviours. Finally, genetic algorithms and learning techniques are associated in the last experiment, showing a high adaptive structure. An important effort has been made to show both advantages and disadvantages of each technique, in order to provide the necessary elements for the continuation of this research activity...|$|R
