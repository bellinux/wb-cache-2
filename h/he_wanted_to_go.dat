5|$|After he was {{released}} from active duty, Basilone returned home and worked as a truck driver in Reisterstown, Maryland. After driving trucks for a few months, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to Manila and believed he could get there faster by serving in the Marines than in the Army.|$|E
5|$|Though he was {{initially}} unsure whether <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to university, Fox's mother {{convinced him to}} enrol at Simon Fraser University, where he studied kinesiology as a stepping stone to becoming a physical education teacher. He tried out for the junior varsity basketball team, earning a spot ahead of more talented players due to his determination.|$|E
5|$|He {{graduated}} from Hall High School with a National Merit Scholarship. He helped take their swim {{team to the}} state championship, filling in for a sick teammate by swimming two legs of a relay. Clark has often repeated the anecdote that he decided <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to West Point after meeting a cadet with glasses who told Clark (who wore glasses as well) that one did not need perfect vision to attend West Point as Clark had thought. Clark applied, and he was accepted on April 24, 1962.|$|E

5|$|He again {{excelled in}} {{basketball}} his senior year, leading {{his team to}} the Queens divisional championship and amassing more points than any other New York City high school basketball player. He was even named captain of the Journal-American All-Scholastic team. He then began to plan for college. His family had wanted him to attend a Catholic school, and <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> somewhere outside New York City. Boston College recruited him, and he considered accepting the BC offer, but it had no dormitories, {{and he was not}} interested in being a commuter student. Soon afterward, he received an offer from the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts about forty miles (64 kilometers) west of Boston. He was impressed by the school, and accepted the basketball scholarship it offered him. He spent the summer before matriculating working at Tamarack Lodge in the Catskill Mountains and playing in a local basketball league along with a number of established college players.|$|E
5|$|Modern writers {{all agree}} that Andrée's North Pole scheme was unrealistic. He relied on the winds blowing {{more or less in}} the {{direction}} <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> on being able to fine-tune his direction with the drag ropes, on the balloon being sealed tight enough to stay airborne for 30 days, and on no ice or snow sticking to the balloon to weigh it down. In the attempt of 1896, the wind immediately refuted his optimism by blowing steadily from the north, straight at the balloon hangar at Danes Island, until the expedition had to pack up, let the hydrogen out of the balloon, and go home. It is now known that northerly winds are to be expected at Danes Island; but in the late 19th century, information on Arctic airflow and precipitation existed only as contested academic hypotheses. Even Ekholm, an Arctic climate researcher, had no objection to Andrée's theory of where the wind was likely to take them. The observational data simply did not exist.|$|E
25|$|He {{announced}} his retirement on 17 October 2007 after a Twenty20 tournament wherein he was New Zealand's leading run-scorer with 163 runs {{at an average of}} 40.75 and a strike-rate of 181.

25|$|After {{recording}} an 8–8 {{record in}} 1988, Elway once again led {{his team to}} the Super Bowl after the 1989 season, with yet another win over the Browns in the AFC championship game, going on to face the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XXIV. However this game ended even worse for the Broncos than their previous Super Bowl losses. San Francisco blew out Denver 55–10, the most lopsided score in Super Bowl history. Although Elway scored the only touchdown for his team on a three-yard run, his performance was abysmal: 10 out of 26 completions for 108 yards with no touchdown passes and two interceptions. But he didn't try {{to hide from the}} media after the game or downplay his dismal performance. And when he was asked if <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to the Super Bowl after three losses, he responded that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back every year, even if his team kept losing. Still by this point, many doubted that he would ever win a Super Bowl in his career.|$|E

25|$|The RCMP on October 23 {{released}} security video showing Zehaf-Bibeau's movements {{across the}} Parliament Hill precinct. They also announced that Zehaf-Bibeau {{was not one}} of 93 suspected extremists on a RCMP high-risk traveller list, though email written by Zehaf-Bibeau had been found on a computer belonging to an unnamed individual charged with terrorism offences. At this meeting, RCMP Commissioner Paulson said Zehaf-Bibeau's mother had told the RCMP that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Syria, but she denied this, stating that, in a recorded interview, she had told the RCMP that he had wanted to go to Saudi Arabia.|$|E

25|$|Van Sant got {{an offer}} of $2 million from an outside {{investor}} but when he put off production for nine months so that Phoenix could make Dogfight, the investor and his money disappeared. Producer Laurie Parker shopped the script around and, at the time, New Line Cinema {{was in the process}} of branching out into producing arthouse films and decided to back Van Sant's vision with a USD$2.5 million budget. In an interview in March 2012, Kiefer Sutherland said that he declined the offer by Gus Van Sant to star in the lead role because <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> skiing, a decision he has said he regrets.|$|E

He kept repeating that he did not trust LaRouche, and said <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to England. She told him he was free to leave and could phone her if he wanted to, which seemed to reassure him. She last saw him with one of his roommates sitting {{on the steps of the}} museum around 8:30pm.|$|E
25|$|Later in 2008, Marshall and Jones {{left the}} band to pursue other careers. Charlie Griffiths, the guitarist {{for the band}} Linear Sphere and Anchorhead became a {{full-time}} member of the band. Griffiths parted ways with Linear Sphere because <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{in a different direction}} musically. Mexican keyboardist Diego Tejeida auditioned and eventually joined the band in late 2008 as well. As they began to tour more, even opening a few UK shows for King's X, Sensory Records recognized them and offered them a record deal. They began recording for their debut album, Aquarius, soon after, and it was released in March 2010.|$|E

25|$|After {{ensuring}} that the letter would reach its destination, the king announced that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Porto. He met with an advising council, the officials {{and part of the}} escort. The commander João Agnelo Velez Caldeira Castelo Branco and the chief officer João Jorge Moreira de Sá opposed the opinion of the monarch, claiming that if Porto turned them away, they would not have enough fuel to reach a different anchorage. Despite the insistence of D. Manuel II, the chief officer argued that they carried on board the whole royal family, so his main duty was to save their lives. In the end, the chosen port was Gibraltar. Once there, the king found out that Porto had also joined the republican cause. D. Manuel sent orders that the ship, being legally the Portuguese State's property, be returned to Lisbon. The deposed king would live out {{the rest of his life}} in exile.|$|E
25|$|This {{new version}} of Krypto has all the {{physical}} abilities of his pre-Crisis predecessor, but with a normal canine intellect. This initially causes {{a great deal of}} trouble for his new master when, for instance, he would scratch at a door to indicate <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out and unintentionally gouged big chunks out of the door with his super strength, or inflicting grievous bodily harm when combating villains (since Krypto bites the way a regular canine would, only without being careful about his super strength). As a result, Krypto is for some time locked away in the Fortress of Solitude under the care of one of Superman's robots. This robot is programmed to emit the scent of the dog's real master. Superman has {{gone to great lengths to}} train the dog, and he now occasionally accompanies the Man of Steel on missions. Batman never misses an opportunity to poke fun at Krypto when Batman and Superman don't see eye-to-eye.|$|E
25|$|Regarded as a five-star recruit by {{both the}} Rivals.com and Scout.com {{recruiting}} networks, Peterson was listed as the No. 1 running back and overall prospect in the Class of 2004 by Rivals.com.

Concluding his high school football career at the annual U.S. Army All-American Bowl, he led the West squad with 95 yards on nine carries and scored two touchdowns, and announced at the game that he would attend college at the University of Oklahoma. Following his senior season, he was awarded the Hall Trophy as the U. S. Army National Player of the Year.
