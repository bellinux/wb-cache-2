5|$|The {{maritime}} fur {{trade was}} a ship-based fur trade system {{that focused on}} acquiring furs of sea otters and other animals from the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast and natives of Alaska. The furs were mostly sold in China in exchange for tea, silks, porcelain, and other Chinese goods, which were then sold in Europe and the United States. The maritime fur trade was pioneered by Russians, working east from Kamchatka along the Aleutian Islands to the southern coast of Alaska. British and Americans entered during the 1780s, <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> is now the coast of British Columbia. The trade boomed around {{the beginning of the}} 19th century. A long period of decline began in the 1810s. As the sea otter population was depleted, the maritime fur trade diversified and transformed, tapping new markets and commodities, while continuing to focus on the Northwest Coast and China. It lasted until the middle to late 19th century. Russians controlled most of the coast of what is now Alaska during the entire era. The coast south of Alaska endured fierce competition between, and among, British and American trading vessels. The British were the first to operate in the southern sector, but were unable to compete against the Americans, who dominated from the 1790s to the 1830s. The British Hudson's Bay Company entered the coast trade in the 1820s with the intention of driving the Americans away. This was accomplished by about 1840. In its late period, the maritime fur trade was largely conducted by the British Hudson's Bay Company and the Russian-American Company.|$|E
25|$|Abstract algebra was {{developed}} in the 19th century, deriving from the interest in solving equations, initially <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> is now called Galois theory, and on constructibility issues. George Peacock was the founder of axiomatic thinking in arithmetic and algebra. Augustus De Morgan discovered relation algebra in his Syllabus of a Proposed System of Logic. Josiah Willard Gibbs developed an algebra of vectors in three-dimensional space, and Arthur Cayley developed an algebra of matrices (this is a noncommutative algebra).|$|E
25|$|From {{the end of}} the 19th {{century and}} through most of the 20th century, this part of Mexico City {{suffered}} a severe decline. This house was adapted to rent space to lower-class tenants and by end of the 1950s had become tenements, {{in spite of the fact}} that it had been declared a national monument in 1931. In 1960, the Mexico City government acquired the building from the descendents of the Counts of Santiago de Calimaya in 1960. The City decided to convert this building into a museum. It hired architect Pedro Ramirez Vazques to remodel it, converting the old rooms into exhibition halls. In 1964, the Museum of the City of Mexico was inaugurated, <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> Mexico City was and what Mexico City hoped to be. However, by 1992, the Museum was in disarray. The museum closed and there were plans to convert it into lodging for guests of the city, but this never came to pass. In 1997, the Museum was reorganized and reopened dedicated to exhibitions about Mexico City's past, present and future, working in cooperation with the Museo Nacional de Antropología, the Museo de Arte Moderno the Museo de Virreinato and the Galería de Historia.|$|E

500|$|During {{his student}} years, Lethbridge had frequented the Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, {{where he had}} befriended its curator, Louis Clarke. Upon Lethbridge's graduation, Clarke offered him the honorary {{position}} of Keeper of Anglo-Saxon Antiquities at the museum. Lethbridge took up the voluntary and unpaid post, being able to subsist on his family's finances. There, Lethbridge befriended the archaeologist Cyril Fox, aiding in Fox's excavation of the Devil's Dyke in Cambridgeshire. Lethbridge's archaeological excavations were however deemed of poor quality by many of his peers. In turn, Lethbridge derided the archaeological establishment, being frustrated by {{how long it took}} them to accept what he deemed to be [...] "facts", and he believed in <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> he believed to be instinct and common sense. There were exceptions to his scorn; for instance, he developed a friendship with T. D. Kendrick, an Anglo-Saxon art historian who then worked as Keeper of the British Museum in London. Over the course of his career at the museum, Lethbridge produced 60 archaeological reports, written in an unusually informal manner that used humour and wit and included narrative descriptions of the excavation process.|$|E
500|$|In late 2010, Square Enix {{announced}} a franchise reboot titled Tomb Raider; the new Lara Croft {{would be a}} darker, grittier reimagining of the character. In examining the character, Crystal Dynamics concluded that Croft's largest failing was her [...] "Teflon coating", and that it needed a more human version that players would care about. The studio sought a new voice actress, trialling dozens of relatively unknown performers. The second reboot focuses {{on the origin of}} the character, and as a result, changes the previous back story. Staff opted to first work on the character's biography rather than cosmetic aspects. Crystal Dynamics sought to avoid the embellished physique of past renditions and pushed for realistic proportions. In redesigning the character's appearance, the designers began with simple concepts and added features that it felt made Lara Croft iconic: a ponytail, [...] "M-shaped" [...] lips, and the spatial relationship between her eyes, mouth, and nose. The company also changed the character's wardrobe, <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> it believed was more functional and practical. In designing the outfits, staff aimed to create a look that was [...] "relevant" [...] and [...] "youthful", but not too [...] "trendy" [...] or [...] "hip". To gauge the redesign, Crystal Dynamics conducted eye tracking studies on subjects who viewed the new version and previous ones.|$|E
500|$|However, {{some critics}} {{felt that the}} album was overly ambitious and that the band's musical {{departure}} may alienate listeners. Chad Grischow of IGN felt that the album's dramatic hooks seem [...] "bloated" [...] at times: [...] "The band does a great of <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> they do best, but the album does drown itself a bit with all the overwhelming enormity of it all." [...] Scott Shetler of Slant disliked the [...] "melodramatic" [...] undertones of [...] "I've Got All This Ringing in My Ears and None on My Fingers" [...] and [...] "Golden", writing [...] "they don't handle that style quite as well as Panic! at the Disco". Cory Apar of AllMusic opined that the album's pop direction contradicts the band's lyrical claims of wishing to stick to their roots. He called the album's various styles [...] "hit and miss", yet commented that [...] "Once Infinity on High sinks in, it's indeed a fun record. But for a band that was once so self-assured and able to utilize its talents so compellingly, the album is regrettably haphazard." [...] Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian believed that the album was overly sullen, but noted that [...] "They may not be happy, but they haven't forgotten to be catchy." [...] Barry Nicholson of NME found the amount of guest producers to be unnecessary and disliked some of the songs, but admired the album's [...] "infectious" [...] nature.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} {{commissioned}} in 2002 by ITV's head of drama Nick Elliott, who encouraged Peter Morgan {{to put aside}} any other projects and start work on a script as soon as possible. Granada was initially sceptical of producing it; the company's executive chairman and chief executive—Charles Allen and Simon Shaps respectively—believed that Blair {{would be forced to}} resign as Prime Minister over the impending war in Iraq, consequently leaving the story outdated. The project was believed to be [...] "too cerebral" [...] and attempts were made to persuade Morgan to develop a television series to replace Cold Feet, another Granada production. John Whiston and Andy Harries convinced Allen and Shaps otherwise, citing Granada's history of producing ground-breaking drama and film as reasons for why The Deal should be made. ITV's director of channels, David Liddiment, who supported the production, resigned in December 2002 and was replaced by Nigel Pickard, who shared the concerns of Allen and Shaps. Peter Morgan wrote his first script draft in the three weeks preceding Christmas 2002. Recent events such as the 2001 foot and mouth outbreak and the contention surrounding the September Dossier made him believe that the perceived adversity between Brown and Blair was no longer in the public consciousness. His opinion was changed when he watched the 2002 Labour Party Conference and saw a [...] "thunderous expression" [...] on Brown's face as Bill Clinton praised Blair in his speech; Morgan realised that the rivalry was not over. This draft was extremely sympathetic to Brown, <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> Morgan called [...] "Gordon's heartbreak". Subsequent rewrites toned down this approach, though Brown still remained the [...] "main character".|$|E

2500|$|Gregg Landaker and Gary Rizzo were sound {{engineers}} for the film, {{tasked with}} sound mixing, while sound editor Richard King supervised the process. Christopher Nolan said {{he sought to}} mix the film's sound to take maximum advantage of current sound equipment in theaters. Nolan paid close attention to designing the sound mix, for instance <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> buttons being pressed with astronaut-suit gloves would sound like. The studio's website said that [...] "The sound on Interstellar has been specially mixed to maximize {{the power of the}} low-end frequencies in the main channels {{as well as in the}} subwoofer channel." [...] Nolan deliberately intended some dialogue to seem drowned out by ambient noise or music, causing some theaters to post notices emphasising that this effect was intentional and not a fault in their equipment.|$|E

2500|$|After being [...] "utterly inspired" [...] by Jonathon Porritt's book Seeing Green, Lucas {{joined the}} Green Party in 1986. She {{recalled}} in 2007: [...] "I thought, right! I'm going there now" [...] to the Green's main office on Clapham High Street, near where she lived. [...] "I'm {{just going to}} dedicate {{the rest of my}} life to this party". Soon afterwards she became the party's National Press Officer (1987–89) and Co-Chair (1989–90). Lucas has a reputation as a party moderniser, in terms of internal slang, a [...] "spiky" [...] rather than a [...] "fluffy". In a 2009 Guardian interview, she told Decca Aitkenhead: [...] "when I was putting people up to go on TV programmes I'd be saying to them, 'What are you planning to wear?', and they'd be slightly offended that I'd even think of asking the question. But I do genuinely think that has changed, a lot. It's a recognition, not that there's some kind of terrible compromise about putting on a tie, but that actually you don't want people to be <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> you look like but on what you're saying".|$|E
2500|$|When Sam Carter {{joined the}} band to replace Matt Johnson, drummer Dan Searle had {{commented that the}} lyrics Carter wrote drew from more {{personal}} experience than those of his predecessor. The lyrics of Hollow Crown focus {{on a number of}} themes, with some songs dealing with everyday life like sitting in a car with friends or angst against girls, while some other songs, particularly [...] "Early Grave", [...] "Follow the Water" [...] and [...] "In Elegance", were written about Carter's growing dependence on cannabis and him [...] "struggling against his own instincts and self-destructive obsessions". Two songs featured on Hollow Crown – [...] "Dead March" [...] and [...] "Left with the Last Minute" [...] – feature [...] "call and response-type" [...] lyrics about a stalker and their victim's response to being stalked, respectively. For the lyrics of Daybreaker, Carter and Tom Searle collaborated on writing, <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> they believed to be [...] "bigger picture" [...] themes, such as the critique of negative aspects of religion and society. Carter and Searle collaborated again on the lyrics of Lost Forever // Lost Together, and in an attempt not to sound like a [...] "broken record", they no longer only addressed political issues, but also focused on themes that everyone can relate to.|$|E
2500|$|The former {{trend in}} Disney's {{hand-drawn}} features where {{the characters and}} cinematography were influenced by a CGI-look has been abandoned. Andreas Deja, a veteran Disney animator who supervised the character of Mama Odie, says [...] "I always thought that maybe we should distinguish ourselves {{to go back to}} what 2D is good at, which is <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> the line can do rather than volume, which is a CG kind of thing. So we are doing less extravagant Treasure Planet kind of treatments. You have to create a world but [...] What we're trying to do with Princess and the Frog is hook up with things that the old guys did earlier. It's not going to be graphic...". Deja also mentions that Lasseter was aiming for the Disney sculptural and dimensional look of the 1950s: [...] "All those things that were non-graphic, which means go easy on the straight lines and have one volume flow into the other– an organic feel to the drawing." [...] Lasseter also felt that traditional animation created more character believability. For example, with Louis the alligator, created by Eric Goldberg, Lasseter said: [...] "It's the believability of this large character being able to move around quite like that." [...] Choreographer Betsy Baytos was brought by the directors to lead a team of eccentric dancers that gave reference to make each character a different style of movement. The character design tried to create beautiful drawings through subtle shapes, particularly for most characters being human. For the frog versions of Tiana and Naveen, while the animators started with realistic designs, they eventually went for cutesy characters [...] "removing all that is unappealing in frogs", similar to Pinocchios Jiminy Cricket.|$|E
