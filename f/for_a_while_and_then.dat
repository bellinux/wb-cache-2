5|$|The Przeworsk culture {{people of}} the earlier Roman period lived in small, {{unprotected}} villages, populated each by a few dozen residents at most, made up of several houses, usually set partially below the ground level (semi-sunken), each covering an area of 8–22 square meters. They knew how to dig and build wells, so the settlements didn't have to be located near bodies of water. Thirteen 2nd century wells with variously constructed timber lined walls were found at a settlement in Stanisławice, Bochnia County. Fields were being used for crop cultivation <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> as pastures, when animal excrement helped the soil regain fertility. Once iron share plows were introduced the fields were alternated between tillage and grazing.|$|E

500|$|Mature female bolas spiders of {{the genus}} Mastophora build [...] "webs" [...] that consist of only a single [...] "trapeze line", which they patrol.

They emit chemicals that resemble the pheromones of moths, and then swing the bolas at the moths.

The spiders eat the bolas if they have not made a kill in about 30 minutes, rest <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> make new bolas. Juveniles and adult males are much smaller and do not make bolas. Instead they release different pheromones that attract moth flies, and catch them with their front pairs of legs.|$|E
