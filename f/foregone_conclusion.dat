This was emblematic of his later treatment which resulted in his being forced into the role of an outcast of the physics community, thus leaving him little choice but to align himself with industrialists.|$|E

On March 24, 1794 in Kraków, Tadeusz Kościuszko declared {{what has come to be}} known as the Kościuszko Uprising. On May 7, he issued the Proclamation of Połaniec (Uniwersał Połaniecki), granting freedom to the peasants and ownership of land to all who fought in the insurrection. Revolutionary tribunals administered summary justice to those deemed traitors to the Commonwealth. After initial victories at the Battle of Racławice (April 4), the capture of Warsaw (April 18) and the Wilno (April 22)the Uprising was crushed when the forces of Russia, Austria and Prussia joined in a military intervention.

The defeat of Kościuszko's forces led in 1795 to the third and final partition of the Commonwealth.|$|E

40|$|Foreshadowing {{in a novel}} {{would seem}} to imply that that novel {{takes place in a}} world of fate, but Charles Dickens’s Bleak House and Thomas Hardy’s A Pair of Blue Eyes complicate this assumption. Instead of {{directly}} arguing against a world of fate, however, their foreshadowing techniques present fate as a subjective experience, most likely shared by people who have been trained to read their own lives novelistically. While Dickens’s novel shows readers a meaningful world in which all secret plot information will be revealed eventually, Hardy’s novel stresses readers’ inability to know the whole story and teases them with withheld information all the way to its end. In this thesis, I attempt to explore foreshadowing in especially cryptic passages of Bleak House and A Pair of Blue Eyes.   In Bleak House, I focus on the foreshadowing in the scenes leading up to Krook and Tulkinghorn’s deaths.   In A Pair of Blue Eyes, my focus is less chapter-centric, although I spend considerable time examining Henry Knight’s near-death experience on the Cliff Without a Name.   Much of the critical framework for my close readings comes from Peter Brook’s Reading for the Plot and Michael André Bernstein’s <b>Foregone</b> <b>Conclusions.</b>   While Reading for the Plot supplements my commentary on repetition’s relation to resolution in a plot, <b>Foregone</b> <b>Conclusions</b> gives me the vocabulary to discuss different types of foreshadowing and their effects. Although these critics, and others, inform my work, I add my own perspective on the features of foreshadowing, by looking at how readers’ experiences of foreshadowing change when they re-read a text...|$|R

Murray is utterly faithful to the neoconservative version of how liberalism went wrong in the 1960 s. He says an intellectual elite shifted the blame for poverty, crime and low achievement to "the system" destroying individual responsibility. But his argument is not supported by evidence.

5|$|Johnston took up cricket from {{an early}} age, playing with his elder brother Allan {{throughout}} the year on a backyard pitch on the family's dairy farm, owned by his father. Beeac's local team, which competed in the Colac District Association, occasionally had difficulty in assembling a full side. As a result, Johnston made his debut aged only twelve alongside his brother after an invitation from his schoolteacher. On debut, when a draw became a <b>foregone</b> <b>conclusion,</b> Johnston was allowed to bowl the final over, taking a wicket maiden. The following season, the brothers led Beeac's attack, continuing to do so after moving to Colac High School, where Bill became captain of the cricket and football teams and a prefect. Johnston left school at sixteen, working in Colac, before following Allan to Melbourne in 1939. He joined Richmond Cricket Club in the Third XI and took 6/16. After five games {{he was promoted to}} the Second XI, and made his first grade debut in the last game of the 1939–40 season. The following season, when nineteen, he was selected for Victoria's Sheffield Shield match against Queensland, but the Pearl Harbor attacks forced the cancellation of competitive cricket and the match did not go ahead. Johnston joined the Royal Australian Air Force along with his brother, serving for four years as a radar technician in northern Australia. It was at training camp that he first met Keith Miller. Johnston was not posted overseas, unlike his brother, who {{died in a plane crash}} in Ireland.|$|E

40|$|This article {{draws upon}} recent youth {{research}} {{in some of}} Britain's poorest neighbourhoods (in Teesside, north-east England). It {{stresses the importance of}} a qualitative, biographical and long-term perspective in attempting to understand drug-using and criminal careers (and wider youth transitions) and points to some difficulties in applying — straightforwardly — influential models of risk assessment and prediction to individual biographies. In a context of deep, collective disadvantage, most research participants shared many of the risk factors associated with social exclusion in early adulthood. Yet the majority did not pursue full-blown criminal or drug-using careers and the research struggled to identify background factors that seemed to play a causal role in separating out more 'delinquent' transitions from more 'conventional' ones. Youth biographies were marked by flux; they did not roll on deterministically to <b>foregone</b> <b>conclusions.</b> Unpredictable 'critical moments' turned transitions in unpredictable directions; sometimes towards crime, sometimes away. The article concludes that there is danger in criminal career research — as in studies of youth transition — in prioritising individual level explanations at the expense of an assessment of the 'risks' presented by sociospatial and historical context...|$|R
