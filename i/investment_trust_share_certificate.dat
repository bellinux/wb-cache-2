40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{selectivity}} and timing {{performance of a}} large sample (79) of UK <b>investment</b> <b>trusts</b> {{over a long period}} (15 years) by applying a number of models. There are few studies in this area in the UK. It is often argued that investors hold <b>investment</b> <b>trust</b> <b>shares</b> to obtain diversification and managerial skills. Managerial skill, if present, should be observed in the form of superior selectivity and timing performance measures. The general decline in the level of discount observed in the industry over the sample period suggests that excess returns could be obtained by holding <b>investment</b> <b>trusts</b> <b>shares.</b> We use single index and multifactor models for the analysis. Positive but statistically insignificant, selectivity estimates and negative, and at times significant, timing estimates are observed. Copyright Blackwell Publishers Ltd 1999. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{considers}} the pricing of <b>investment</b> <b>trust</b> <b>shares</b> in the 1960 s when data on {{net asset value}} were not available on a real time basis, but viewable only infrequently {{on the basis of}} annual company reports, and when the industry itself was in rapid transition from an old fashioned industry to the modern industry of today. A significant relationship is found between changes in both <b>investment</b> <b>trust</b> yields and retention ratios and subsequent changes in the ex-post observable discount. The suggestion is that as yields rise the fixed management charge erodes a smaller proportion of the trust's income. The more than proportionate rise in the share's price then shows up as a smaller discount. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} institutional investor behavior on the stock return synchronicity using a sample of Taiwanese listed companies for the period 2000 - 2005. We find that stock prices reflect more firm-specific information for firms whose institutional ownerships are higher. Synchronicity is negatively associated {{with the number of}} shares held by foreign investors and securities dealers. The negative relationship suggests that the transactions of foreign investors and securities dealers increase the relative flow of firm-specific information to prices. Stock prices contain more market- and industry-level information in firms with more securities <b>investment</b> <b>trust</b> companies' <b>shares</b> or dominated by securities <b>investment</b> <b>trust</b> companies. The higher the change of ownership ratio of foreign investors, securities <b>investment</b> <b>trust</b> companies, and securities dealers, the lower the synchronicity is. This implies that more firm-specific information impounds into stock prices. From the simultaneous equation estimations, institutional investors and synchronicity are endogenously determined. The level of synchronicity influences the number of shares of these three parties, which in turn influences the level of synchronicity. The above results hold after considering the robustness tests of highly-market-value-weighted stocks and securities <b>investment</b> <b>trust</b> companies' strategies. institutional investors, stock return synchronicity...|$|R

Modified {{duration and}} convexity – {{interest rate risk}} measures generally applied in bond analyses – could therefore be natural candidates to measure the REIT price sensitivity to interest rate changes.

Then, we test this model empirically using data from all the 22 Italian listed REITs in the time period 2007 – 09. Our {{results show that the}} relationship between REIT price changes and interest rate variations is, indeed, nonlinear and significanteven after market price fluctuations are taken into account.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{development}} of the closed-end <b>investment</b> <b>trust</b> in both the UK and the US, {{in the context of the}} investment management strategies adopted and whether they provided value-added services for investors. Although US <b>investment</b> <b>trusts</b> of the 1920 s boom years were heavily influenced by their earlier UK counterparts, they differed from British <b>investment</b> <b>trusts</b> in a number of key ways, in particular, size, capital structure, tax and accounting practices, management, and costs. These differences led to their relatively much worse performance in the stock market crash of the late 1920 s and early 1930 s. This poor US trust performance led directly to the creation of the US open-ended ‘fixed trust’, marketed as an antidote to the generally poor management of conventional closed-end <b>investment</b> <b>trusts.</b> As confidence in mutual funds slowly returned in the United States, open-ended funds were gradually given more flexibility, but US <b>investment</b> <b>trust</b> companies, with <b>share</b> prices at a steep discount to liquidation value, and partly blamed for the crash, were encouraged to convert to mutual fund status by the 1936 Revenue Act. By 1944, open-end funds had overtaken <b>investment</b> <b>trusts</b> in terms of asset size, a phenomenon that did not occur in Britain for another 30 years...|$|R
40|$|The {{exchange-traded}} funds (ETFs) are traded {{just like}} {{shares of common}} stocks, but they are unit <b>investment</b> <b>trusts</b> and their <b>share</b> prices are directly linked to their respective stock indexes. Theoretical models have predicted that the ETFs markets would attract trading volume from liquidity traders because their losses due to adverse trades with informed traders would usually be lower in ETFs markets than in individual securities markets. This study uses SPDRs and DIAMONDS as examples of ETFs to empirically investigate the hypotheses specified in the theoretical models. Consistent with the hypotheses, {{we find that the}} information asymmetry is lower in the ETFs markets than in the market of their underlying individual securities. ETFs markets are more liquid and have lower adverse selection costs and lower trade informativeness compared with their underlying individual securities...|$|R
40|$|Discount {{volatility}} {{is generally}} {{an important component}} of total risk for closed-end funds but there is considerable cross-sectional variation in the magnitude of this discount volatility. These are interesting aspects of the closed-end fund discount puzzle which have received little attention in the literature, particularly as regards UK <b>investment</b> <b>trusts.</b> This paper seeks to explain the cross-sectional variation in discount volatility for the UK <b>investment</b> <b>trust</b> sector. The sample consists of 59 UK conventional <b>investment</b> <b>trusts</b> in continuous operation over the five years from 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1996. Discount volatility is calculated using monthly intervals. Four explanatory variables are highly significant - <b>trust</b> <b>share</b> turnover, standard deviation of NAV return, market value and percentage of underlying assets which are unquoted. There is no evidence that either small investor sentiment or UK specific sentiment has any impact on discount volatility...|$|R
40|$|Privatization of {{publicly}} traded companies arguably {{represents one of the}} most important trends in North American business during this decade. The sweep of private equity (PE) through the hotel and other industries was dramatic, until the 2007 credit crisis slammed on the brakes. Because these transactions are leveraged buyouts (LBOs), the reduced availability of debt capital stemming from recent problems in the credit markets appears to be responsible for the disappearance of PE deals. Notwithstanding those matters, conditions unrelated to debt financing sparked the PE surge during the early 2000 s. As detailed in this report, these conditions are property market liquidity, real estate <b>investment</b> <b>trust</b> (REIT) <b>shares</b> trading at deep discounts to net asset values (NAVs), high regulatory costs for public companies, public company incentive problems, and factors specific to real estate ownership companies that make them poorly suited for public trading. The same conditions could motivate another wave of public-to-private transactions when debt for large-scale transactions again becomes available. A principal source of this funding is found in pension accounts. Despite problems in the credit markets and the U. S. economic slowdown, money continues to flow into the pension accounts from a record number of workers. Fund managers must invest this capital somewhere! Forecasting how much will flow to finance PE-led LBOs during the coming years, particularly hotel company LBOs, requires consideration of a variety of underlying economic, financial, and regulatory conditions...|$|R

There is clear evidence of excess volatility of <b>trust</b> <b>share</b> returns compared with NAV returns. Since Big Bang in 1986, there has been a significant ‘double whammy’ effect, meaning that discounts tend to widen when NAVs fall and narrow when NAVs rise.
