25|$|Temporal {{aliasing}} is a {{major concern}} in the sampling of video and audio signals. Music, for instance, may contain high-frequency components that are inaudible to humans. If a piece of music is sampled at 32000 samples per second (Hz), any frequency components above 16000 Hz (the Nyquist frequency for this sampling rate) will cause aliasing when the music is reproduced by a <b>digital</b> <b>to</b> <b>analog</b> <b>converter</b> (DAC). To prevent this, an anti-aliasing filter is used to remove components above the Nyquist frequency prior to sampling.|$|E

50|$|A pipelined ADC (also called subranging quantizer) uses two or {{more steps}} of subranging. First, a coarse {{conversion}} is done. In a second step, the difference to the input signal is determined with a <b>digital</b> <b>to</b> <b>analog</b> <b>converter</b> (DAC). This difference is then converted finer, {{and the results are}} combined in a last step. This can be considered a refinement of the successive-approximation ADC wherein the feedback reference signal consists of the interim conversion of a whole range of bits (for example, four bits) rather than just the next-most-significant bit. By combining the merits of the successive approximation and flash ADCs this type is fast, has a high resolution, and only requires a small die size.|$|E
