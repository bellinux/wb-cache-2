40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} some {{processing}} treatments on the proximate composition of dehulled and undehulled mungbean seeds flours were investigated.

Results showed that increase in boiling time (30, 45, 60 and 90 min) did not significantly (p> 0. 05) increase the moisture (10. 30 - 10. 65 %) and carbohydrate (57. 16 - 65. 05 %) contents but rather decreased the fat, ash, crude fiber and energy values.
