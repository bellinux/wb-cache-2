The equipment was transported directly through the Soviet Union via the Trans-Siberian railway, and a 15 km track of railroad between Beijing Railway Station and Dongjiao Station was built especially to service the factory. Caltech-educated scientist Dr. Luo Peilin (罗沛霖), formerly head of the <b>preparatory</b> <b>group</b> in 1951-1953, was Head Engineer of Joint Factory 718 during its construction phase.

There are three volumes to the Briefing Book. This second volume contains input that the <b>Preparatory</b> <b>Group</b> has received. The structure of this volume of the Briefing Book is summarised here. In the following chapter we collect the documents received as input to the Strategy Group from individual scientists, collaborations, working groups, etc. Most of these documents were submitted before the Orsay Open Symposium, and contributed to the material presented by the Symposium speakers, and to the ensuing discussions. They are reproduced here unedited, and grouped by topic following the chapter subdivision of Briefing Book 1, Part 1. Chapter 3 presents contributions received from national scientific communities, from laboratories and from funding agencies. These range from general statements, to detailed road maps for the field. Some of these documents were prepared specifically for the Strategy Group evaluation, others were pre-existing, and others reflect the current status of studies in progress. In this last case, the web-based version of Briefing Book 2 [URL] contains links to the most up-to-date version of these documents. Chapter 4 collects the reports emerged from recent Committee reviews, both in the field of elementary particle physics, and in the research areas covered by the Committees present as observers in Zeuthen, ApPEC and NuPECC. Reviews which are currently in progress are also listed, and the relative links to the updated materials is available from the web-based version of Briefing Book 2.

40|$|A liquid chromatographic {{method for}} {{determining}} low aflatoxin M 1 concentrations in milk was evaluated in an International Dairy Federation (IDF) interlaboratory study. The study involved 16 participants from 11 countries. The method, chosen after {{a comparison of}} several methods by a <b>preparatory</b> <b>group,</b> uses an immunoaffinity column for cleanup. As the sample passes through the column, antibodies selectively bind with aflatoxin M 1 (antigen) present and form an antibody-antigen complex. All other components of the sample matrix are washed off the column with water. Then, aflatoxin M 1 is eluted from the column with acetonitrile, which is collected. Final determination is carried out by reversed-phase liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Over the tested range (80 - 600 ng aflatoxin M 1 /kg milk powder), an RSDR ranging from 11 to 23 % was obtained by analyzing 24 samples (blind duplicates), 2 samples of which were blanks...|$|R
40|$|On July 4, 2012, the {{discovery}} of a new boson, with mass around 125 GeV/c 2 and with properties compatible with those of a standard-model Higgs boson, was announced at CERN. In this context, a high-luminosity electron-positron collider ring, operating in the LHC tunnel at a centre-of-mass energy of 240 GeV and called LEP 3, becomes an attractive opportunity both from financial and scientific point of views. The performance and the suitability of the CMS detector are evaluated, with emphasis on an accurate measurement of the Higgs boson properties.
