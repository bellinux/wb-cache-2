500|$|... id Software {{replaced}} Certain Affinity {{to work on}} the game's multiplayer for Microsoft Windows {{after the}} game's launch and promised to fix its issues and introduced new features such as private matches, custom game settings and an enhanced cheat detection system. At E3 2016 on June 12, Bethesda Softworks announced its division, Bethesda VR, and that it was working on virtual reality support for the newly released Doom, set for release on an unspecified date. Also at E3 2016 on that day, Bethesda Softworks and id Software announced the game's free demo, which was initially going to last for only a week but was extended indefinitely. They also announced new multiplayer downloadable content titled Unto the Evil, whose features include three maps and a new demon called the [...] "Harvester", gun, <b>equipment</b> <b>item,</b> taunts, and armor sets. The DLC was released on August 4, 2016. Patches for Doom were released after the game's release; these patches introduced a new photo mode, classic weapon pose, and support for the Vulkan API. The Vulkan patch is expected to enable playable framerates on older hardware. Subsequent benchmarks show up to 66% improvement in the frame rates on AMD graphics cards, with minor changes in the performance of Nvidia cards.|$|E

50|$|Equipment {{is special}} items a {{character}} can wield or wear. An <b>equipment</b> <b>item</b> usually {{is associated with}} an element, including fire, water, earth, air, light and darkness. A piece of equipment can be armor or a weapon.|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "GAO was asked to assess the condition of key <b>equipment</b> <b>items</b> and {{to determine if the}} services have adequate plans for sustaining, modernizing, or replacing them. To address these questions, we selected 25 major <b>equipment</b> <b>items,</b> and determined (1) their current condition, (2) whether the services have mapped out a program strategy for these items, (3) whether current and projected funding is consistent with these strategies, and (4) whether these <b>equipment</b> <b>items</b> are capable of fulfilling their wartime missions. ...|$|R
50|$|Specifications: Written design {{requirements}} of all major <b>equipment</b> <b>items.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Quantity (field C) Identifies {{the number}} of <b>equipment</b> <b>items</b> present.|$|R
50|$|ILS is a {{technique}} introduced by the US Army {{to ensure that the}} supportability of an <b>equipment</b> <b>item</b> is considered during its design and development. The technique was adopted by the UK MOD in 1993 and made compulsory for the procurement of the majority of MOD equipment.|$|E
50|$|Schema {{structure}} includes {{data revision}} and change tracking support, and life-cycle status detail, so applications {{can be developed}} to monitor data alterations over time and maintain records throughout the life-cycle of an <b>equipment</b> <b>item.</b> Units of measurement are also supported by the schemas, so AEX cfiXML can be used within the US or internationally.|$|E
50|$|From a Utilization {{point of}} view, {{it should be}} {{possible}} to review both the utilization of an individual attachment, if they are also rented without their main <b>equipment</b> <b>item,</b> or purely as a subsection of the main item. If individual charges are applied to individual attachments or accessories then this will feed into the financial utilization of the attachment in its own right, but may also be regarded as part of the financial utilization of the main item.|$|E

50|$|In January 1970, the Infantry Board {{completed}} {{the evaluation of}} the load-carrying equipment, and on 17 March 1970, they held a conference at Fort Benning to review the results of the evaluation. They discussed each item evaluated, and agreed as to the acceptable changes to each load-carrying <b>equipment</b> <b>item.</b> They also agreed that the test of the first-generation LINCLOE LCE should be stopped and new items be designed to reflect the characteristics developed {{as a result of the}} evaluations by the NCO Board and Infantry Team.|$|E
50|$|Part One of MIL-STD-810G {{describes}} management, engineering, {{and technical}} {{roles in the}} environmental design and test tailoring process. It focuses {{on the process of}} tailoring design and test criteria to the specific environmental conditions an <b>equipment</b> <b>item</b> is likely to encounter during its service life. New appendices support the succinctly presented text of Part One. It describes the tailoring process (i.e., systematically considering detrimental effects that various environmental factors may have on a specific equipment throughout its service life) and applies this process throughout the equipment's life cycle to meet user and interoperability needs.|$|E
50|$|One <b>equipment</b> <b>item</b> {{of unusual}} {{interest}} was the Vestibular Sled, an ESA contribution {{consisting of a}} seat for a test subject that could be moved backward and forward with precisely controlled accelerations and stops, along rails fixed {{to the floor of}} the Spacelab aisle. By taking detailed measurements on a human strapped into the seat, scientists gained data on the functional organization of the human vestibular and orientation systems, and the vestibular adaptation processes under microgravity. The acceleration experiments by the sled riders were combined with thermal stimulations of the inner ear and optokinetic stimulations of the eye.|$|E

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "With continued heavy military involvement in operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Department of Defense (DOD) is spending billions of dollars sustaining or replacing its inventory of key <b>equipment</b> <b>items</b> while also planning to spend {{billions of dollars to}} develop and procure new systems to transform the department's warfighting capabilities. GAO developed a red, yellow, green assessment framework to (1) assess the condition of 30 selected <b>equipment</b> <b>items</b> from across the four military services, and (2) {{determine the extent to which}} DOD has identified near- and long-term program strategies and funding plans to ensure that these items can meet defense requirements. GAO selected these items based on input from the military services, congressional committees, and our prior work. These 30 <b>equipment</b> <b>items</b> included 18 items that were first assessed in GAO's 2003 report. ...|$|R
50|$|In Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, {{there is}} a Triforce-shaped item known as the Great Force given to Mario & Luigi by Professor E. Gadd at Starbeans Café. Originally during the game's development, Link {{was to make a}} cameo at the Café (along with several other Nintendo {{characters}} like Wario, Fox McCloud, & Samus Aran) and give Mario Bros. the Triforce as an <b>equipment</b> <b>item,</b> but the idea was scrapped and all the intended character cameos where replaced with E. Gadd and the equipment items based on items from the characters' respective games where renamed, resulting in the Triforce item being renamed Great Force.|$|E
50|$|Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a bottom-up, {{inductive}} {{analytical method}} {{which may be}} performed at either the functional or piece-part level. For functional FMEA, failure modes are identified for each function in a system or <b>equipment</b> <b>item,</b> usually {{with the help of}} a functional block diagram. For piece-part FMEA, failure modes are identified for each piece-part component (such as a valve, connector, resistor, or diode). The effects of the failure mode are described, and assigned a probability based on the failure rate and failure mode ratio of the function or component. This quantiazation is difficult for software ---a bug exists or not, and the failure models used for hardware components do not apply. Temperature and age and manufacturing variability affect a resistor; they do not affect software.|$|E
50|$|Every medical {{treatment}} facility should have policies and processes on equipment control and asset management. Equipment control and asset management involves {{the management of}} medical devices within a facility and may be supported by automated information systems (e.g., enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are often found in U.S. hospitals, and the U.S. military health system uses an advanced automated system known as the Defense Medical Logistics Standard Support (DMLSS) suite of applications). Equipment control begins with the receipt of a newly acquired <b>equipment</b> <b>item</b> and continues through the item's entire life cycle. Newly acquired devices should be inspected by in-house or contracted biomedical equipment technicians (BMETs), who will receive an established equipment control/asset number from the facilities equipment/property manager. This control number is used to track and record maintenance actions in their database. This is similar to creating a new chart for a new patient who will be seen at the medical facility. Once an equipment control number is established, the device is safety inspected and readied for delivery to clinical and treatment areas in the facility.|$|E

5000|$|In Castlevania: Symphony of the Night {{there is}} a boss called Count Olrox who is based on Count Orlok. In the game, he is {{described}} as a magic-wielding vampire who rules upper part of Dracula's castle, an area called [...] "Olrox's Quarters". Olrox has two forms: his human form and his true vampire form. After Alucard, the player's character, defeats both forms, a Life Vessel and the Echo of Bat Relic can be obtained. In Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow, {{there is a}}n <b>equipment</b> <b>item</b> called Olrox's Suit which {{is described as a}}n armored suit once worn by Count Olrox. The suit also appears in Castlevania: Harmony of Despair where it can only be used by characters Soma Cruz and Alucard. Count Olrox also appears as the main antagonist in the Castlevania novel Akumajō Dracula: Kabuchi no Tsuisōkyoku which takes place after the events of Aria of Sorrow. A creature that looks very similar to Count Orlok appears frozen in the background of the ice level in Castlevania Chronicles.|$|E
