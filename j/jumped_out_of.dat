25|$|Antikainen was {{allegedly}} {{killed in a}} plane crash near Arkhangelsk in October 1941. As he had openly critizised the Soviet leaders, some believe that his death was not an accident. According to the memoir of the exile Austrian communist Ruth von Mayenburg, Antikainen stayed at the Hotel Lux in Moscow and <b>jumped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the window as the NKVD officers were breaking his door. It is also claimed that he was assassinated by the later head of the Soviet Union Yuri Andropov, because Antikainen tried to take his place in the Komsomol of the Soviet Karelo-Finnish Republic.|$|E

25|$|The attack began poorly. The caravan of {{automobiles}} became separated {{by the time}} it arrived at the barracks, and the car carrying the guerillas' heavy weapons got lost. Furthermore, many of the rebels who would have taken part in the attack were left behind for a lack of weapons. In Castro's autobiography, he claims that he drove his car into a group of soldiers at the gate who had realized an attack was in progress. The men in the cars behind him <b>jumped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their cars, believing they were inside the barracks, and the alarm was sounded before the barracks had been infiltrated. According to Castro, this was the fatal mistake in the operation. The net result of these events was the rebels being outnumbered more than 10 to 1.|$|E

In June 1903 he was auditioned at the Royal College of Music in London by Charles Villiers Stanford, who left the room and brought Hubert Parry in to hear him as well. The violinist Professor Kruse, who was then attempting to revive the Saturday 'Pops' at the St James's Hall <b>jumped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his chair and promptly engaged him, and it was Kruse who arranged for his first appearance in Edward Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius early in 1904 as an addition to his Beethoven Festival.

A member of the All Navy Pistol Team and a longtime pistol and bird shooter, Arnold was an excellent marksman, and shot down a torpedo plane coming in to strafe the new control tower next to which he was standing. The plane crashed on the field. Between the two waves, Jack and a couple of sailors went over to look at the wreckage. Discovering it belonged to the first wave’s Torpedo Squadron Commander, they drank the downed pilot's sake and returned to the battle. That kill from the ground was later to make Jack the only known pilot who shot down five aircraft (one with a BAR, two with an Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bomber, and two with a Grumman F6F Hellcat fighter) who was not an ace.|$|E
25|$|Bruno Manser {{was nearly}} imprisoned twice in Sarawak, {{but managed to}} avoid being jailed. He was first arrested on 10 April 1986 after being spotted by police {{inspector}} Lores Matios. While on holiday at Long Napir, Limbang, Matios arrested Manser and brought him to Limbang police station. Manser was not handcuffed, as the inspector did not carry them while on holiday. During the 90-minute ride to Limbang, the Land Rover that carried Manser came close to running out of petrol. Manser <b>jumped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Land Rover and dived into a local river as the vehicle was being refilled with petrol. Matios shouted at him and used his pistol to fire two shots at Manser. Manser lost all of the notebooks {{he had been working}} on for the previous four years. Bruno Manser was nearly arrested for a second time on 25 March 1990 after meeting the same police inspector on a flight from Miri, Malaysia to Kuching.

He later stated that the expression on her face was so sinister and murderous, that he let out a loud yell and she immediately ran from the room without uttering a single word. Left feeling terrified and uncomfortable, Anderson believed that Gunness intended to murder him. He quickly <b>jumped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed and threw on his clothes. He fled the house without saying goodbye. As he ran away, he kept looking over his shoulder the entire time, fearing Gunness would come chasing after him. When he finally made it to La Porte, he got on the first train headed to Missouri. He never returned for his belongings, nor did he ever speak to Gunness again.|$|E

25|$|In {{this short}} story, {{a man named}} Gunnar was {{suspected}} of manslaughter and escaped to Sweden, where Gunnar became acquainted with this young priestess. He helped her drive Freyr's wagon with the god effigy in it, but the god did not appreciate Gunnar and so attacked him and would have killed Gunnar {{if he had not}} promised himself to return to the Christian faith if he would make it back to Norway. When Gunnar had promised this, a demon <b>jumped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the god effigy and so Freyr was nothing but a piece of wood. Gunnar destroyed the wooden idol and dressed himself as Freyr, then Gunnar and the priestess travelled across Sweden where people were happy to see the god visiting them. After a while he made the priestess pregnant, but this was seen by the Swedes as confirmation that Freyr was truly a fertility god and not a scam. Finally, Gunnar had to flee back to Norway with his young bride and had her baptized at the court of Olaf Tryggvason.|$|E
25|$|O'Hare's initial {{maneuver}} was a high-side diving attack employing accurate deflection shooting. He accurately placed {{bursts of}} gunfire into a Betty's right engine and wing fuel tanks; when the stricken craft of Nitō Hikō Heisō Tokiharu Baba (3rd Shotai) {{on the right}} side of the formation abruptly lurched to starboard, he ducked to the other side of the V formation and aimed at the enemy bomber of Ittō Hikō Heisō Bin Mori (3rd Shotai) on the extreme left. When he made his third and fourth firing passes, the Japanese planes were close enough to the American ships for them to fire their anti-aircraft guns. The five survivors managed to drop their ordnance, but all ten 250kg bombs missed. O'Hare's hits were so concentrated, the nacelle of a Betty <b>jumped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> its mountings, after O'Hare blew up the leading Shōsa Takuzo Ito's Betty's port engine. O'Hare believed he had shot down five bombers, and damaged a sixth. Lieutenant Commander Thach arrived at the scene with other pilots of the flight, later reporting that at one point he saw three of the enemy bombers falling in flames at the same time.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the hijackers}} noticed the airstars moving towards them, they {{recognised}} the imminent assault. As the first airstair reached the front starboard (right) door, {{it became apparent}} that it was elevated too much higher than the door frame for a uniform entry into the aircraft. The GIGN had trained on an empty aircraft, in which the suspension system of the plane was not as compressed, leading to the an overestimation of the necessary height of the airstairs. After a short delay in re positioning the airstairs, GIGN forces were able to enter. The hijackers returned fire, attacking the GIGN forces. One hijacker was killed instantly. Then, the two other units entered the rear of the aircraft. The participants fired hundreds of bullets. The hijackers fired through the skin of the aircraft. Grenades erupted and smoke went through the cabin. The GIGN's concussion grenades temporarily blinded and deafened occupants, allowing the GIGN to storm the aircraft. One of the hijackers' homemade grenades detonated, causing limited damage. The snipers on the tower could not get a clear shot into the aircraft as the copilot, Jean-Paul Borderie, blocked their view. Through a window, Borderie <b>jumped</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the cockpit and staggered away. With the view unobstructed, the snipers began firing into the cockpit, while the GIGN evacuated passengers {{in the rear of the}} aircraft.|$|E
