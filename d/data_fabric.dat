40|$|It {{is easy to}} make {{a mistake}} while wiring up switches, {{particularly}} in the large scale systems modern data centers have become bad wirings or miswirings generally results in diminishing performance in terms of wasted bandwidth, lost reachability, large forwarding tables and high latency. Hence, it is beneficial to identify whether a limited number of changes such as adding, removing, or swapping wires and/or switches could be made to improve the performance of a data center's network. A <b>data</b> center <b>fabric,</b> as built in PortLand [3], is subject to many kinds of faults UNRP [9] was developed to allow the fabric to quickly establish itself and enable forwarding, but it has almost no diagnostic abilities. UNRP operates with no knowledge of the desired configuration nor does it evaluate the quality of the configuration it found. This is because UNRP is in the operational critical path, and has to be fast and free from human intervention. In this thesis, we look at the complementary problem : evaluating an actual configuration of a <b>data</b> center <b>fabric.</b> Solving this problem allows fabric engineers to understand the behavior of the fabric and make informed decisions on how it should be reconfigured or repaired by trading off issues such as cost, disruption, and physical limitations. This thesis focuses on an important core problem in this space : given a known intended topology and the output of UNRP, (1) report on the utility of the fabric as compared to the utility of the intended fabric; (2) come up with a complete and accurate list of the faults in the fabric; (2) give a repair pla...|$|R

This {{is a consequence}} of the yield-like behavior of a Kevlar 49 /epoxy lamina in fiber-directed compression. In this paper, analyses that utilize a simple idealization of compressive yielding are described and calculated results for Kevlar 49 reinforced beams and rings are compared with available <b>data.</b> <b>Fabric</b> reinforced beams are considered first. An existing analysis for unidirectionally reinforced beams is extended to accommodate the bilinear compressive behavior exhibited by a Kevlar 49 fabric reinforced lamina. Next, results of a finite element analysis of a thin, unidirectionally reinforced ring subjected to diametral compression are presented. This analysis uses beam elements that incorporate linear tensile and elastic-perfectly plastic compressive behavior. Finally, a method used to analyze quasi-isotropic beams tested in four-point bending and rings tested in diametral compression is discussed. This finite element analysis uses a layered shell element with a lamina constitutive model that permits elastic-perfectly plastic response to fiber-directed compression, but otherwise assumes linear elastic behavior. Comparison of calculated and experimental results corroborate the ability of analyses using a simple compressive yield model to account for much of the observed flexural nonlinearity in Kevlar 49 /epoxy beams and rings...|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} contribution of this thesis to knowledge are novel digital readout architectures for hybrid pixel readout chips. The thesis presents asynchronous bus-based architecture, a data-node based column architecture and a network-based pixel matrix architecture for data transportation. It is {{shown that the}} data-node architecture achieves readout efficiency 99 % with half the output rate as a bus-based system. The network-based solution avoids “broken” columns due to some manufacturing errors, and it distributes internal data traffic more evenly across the pixel matrix than column-based architectures. An improvement of > 10 % to the efficiency is achieved with uniform and non-uniform hit occupancies. Architectural design has been done using transaction level modeling (TLM) and sequential high-level design techniques for reducing the design and simulation time. It has been possible to simulate tens of column and full chip architectures using the high-level techniques. A decrease of > 10 in run-time is observed using these techniques compared to register transfer level (RTL) design technique. Reduction of 50 % for lines-of-code (LoC) for the high-level models compared to the RTL description has been achieved. Two architectures are then demonstrated in two hybrid pixel readout chips. The first chip, Timepix 3 has been designed for the Medipix 3 collaboration. According to the measurements, it consumes < 1 W/cm^ 2. It also delivers up to 40 Mhits/s/cm^ 2 with 10 -bit time-over-threshold (ToT) and 18 -bit time-of-arrival (ToA) of 1. 5625 ns. The chip uses a token-arbitrated, asynchronous two-phase handshake column bus for internal data transfer. It has also been successfully used in a multi-chip particle tracking telescope. The second chip, VeloPix, is a readout chip being designed for the upgrade of Vertex Locator (VELO) of the LHCb experiment at CERN. Based on the simulations, it consumes < 1. 5 W/cm^ 2 while delivering up to 320 Mpackets/s/cm^ 2, each packet containing up to 8 pixels. VeloPix uses a node-based <b>data</b> <b>fabric</b> for achieving throughput of 13. 3 Mpackets/s from the column to the EoC.
