5|$|As {{a result}} of Hurricane Katrina and the {{subsequent}} 2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans, the congregation's building at 7000 Canal Boulevard filled with at least ten feet of water, and Beth Israel garnered national attention after {{attempts were made to}} save its Torah scrolls. Beth Israel's rabbi, Yisroel Shiff, who had evacuated to Tennessee before <b>Katrina</b> <b>hit,</b> contacted Rabbi Isaac Leider, who had worked on ZAKA search-and-rescue teams in Israel for five years. After contacting federal officials and the Louisiana National Guard, Leider hired a helicopter to fly him to within a mile of Beth Israel, met with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) search-and-rescue team appointed to retrieve the scrolls. The group used rubber rafts to reach Beth Israel and enter it, where Leider waded into the sanctuary and rescued the Torah scrolls and their silver ornaments.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after filming Basic Instinct 2, {{he began}} work on The Reaping (2007) in Louisiana, in which he played science teacher Doug Blackwell {{opposite}} Hilary Swank. The role had been offered to him quite late in pre-production, and he flew to Baton Rouge the Monday after Basic Instinct 2 wrapped. He took the role {{because he was a}} fan of Swank, and Hopkins' film The Life and Death of Peter Sellers (2004), and he preferred the thriller aspect of the Reaping script above the horror aspect. After a week of filming, production had to be suspended when Hurricane <b>Katrina</b> <b>hit</b> the state. He found the filming schedule quite demanding, particularly the three weeks of night filming and a scene in which his character is attacked by a plague of locusts, most of which were computer-generated in post-production but some were real on camera. The Reaping was released in 2007 and performed badly in cinemas. Despite the failures of both films, Morrissey was grateful that they opened him up to more film offers from Hollywood.|$|E

Several weeks later Hurricane Rita devastated portions of western Louisiana and eastern Texas, and then the less severe Hurricane Wilma damaged Florida.|$|E
25|$|The coffee {{companies}} of Houston formed the Greater Houston Coffee Association in fall 2000. The industry {{then tried to}} make Houston a major coffee shipping port. Coffee sold through futures contracts may only be shipped to a New York Board of Trade-certified port, and Texas's ad valorem tax on warehouse inventories {{made it impossible for}} Houston to get such a certification. The tax was written into the Constitution of Texas, so the Greater Houston Coffee Association asked State Representative Joe E. Moreno and State Senator Mario Gallegos to present a constitutional amendment bill to exempt cocoa and coffee stored in Harris County warehouses from the tax. Voters approved the amendment in 2001. Since then Houston's role as a coffee port increased. After Hurricane <b>Katrina</b> <b>hit</b> New Orleans, much of the traffic switched to Houston.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, {{with the}} {{approach}} of Hurricane Katrina, storm surge funneled by {{the confluence of the}} GIWW's and MRGO's levees created multiple breaches in the canal's concrete floodwalls, including the spectacular failure of a quarter-mile length on the Lower 9th Ward side, resulting in catastrophic flooding. On the Upper 9th Ward side, the canal poured through a breach near Florida Avenue. On the opposite side, there were two breaches between Florida Avenue and Claiborne Avenue. A large barge, the ING 4727, floated through the breach closer to the river and was deposited in the Lower 9th Ward. The barge itself may have caused {{one or more of the}} breaches; this possibility is under investigation. The canal lock was functioning two days after <b>Katrina</b> <b>hit,</b> at first mostly for barges bringing in fill to repair the breaches. A month later Hurricane Rita reflooded recently drained areas along the canal by topping emergency fill at the breach sites.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{entitled}} “Optimisme Al Collins Untuk Mencapai Kemenangan dalam Film Hurricane Season” {{tells about}} Al Collins, {{the head coach}} of John Ehret Patriots basketball team. Al Collins was pretty sure about to win 2006 state basketball championship until Hurricane <b>Katrina</b> <b>hits</b> New Orleans and destroyed the team. But Al Collins would not lose to this Hurricane Katrina; he then starts to rebuild Patriots by recruiting either old or new players that still live in New Orleans to take part as Patriots. The aim of this thesis is to show Al Collins’ optimism and things that he did to rebuild the team after he got <b>hit</b> by Hurricane <b>Katrina.</b> In this study, the writer applied library research. The writer gathers information from books and other sources that support the analysis of this thesis. The writer also applied two approach methods which are exponential and psychological approach. Exponential approach consists of the analysis of narrative and cinematic elements. Meanwhile, psychological approach consists {{of the definition of}} optimism as part of psychology. From the analysis, the writer concludes that Al Collins is a strong person. He did not give up even though he had lost everything after the disaster. He believes that his players can do their best and he is very optimistic to win the championship...|$|R

40|$|Our {{social world}} is {{changing}} rapidly, and cartography {{is no exception}} to this. This paper expands on this by examining the effect it has had on data collection for mapping, using OpenStreetMap’s crowdsourcing of geodata as a case study. There are parallels to what is happening with data collection in other aspects of modern life. Wikipedia has changed the whole knowledge landscape, whilst applications like Flickr and You Tube have similarly allowed the easy storage and dissemination of photographs and videos respectively. In today’s society {{there is a need}} for instant information, particularly in crisis situations. Hurricane <b>Katrina,</b> which <b>hit</b> Louisiana with such effect in 2005, showed the problems that inadequate map data can have for aid and emergency work.

5000|$|Begging, panhandling and {{homelessness}} have been prevalent {{issues for the}} state of Louisiana for some time, and correlate closely with its poverty rates. Particularly since the disastrous Hurricane <b>Katrina,</b> which <b>hit</b> many Southern American states in 2005, poverty has maintained at a high level The hurricane led to 1577 deaths in Louisiana alone, with $13 billion invested in flood insurance aid Hurricane Katrina did not just have devastating physical and environmental impacts on Louisiana, but also socio- economical ones. Much of Louisiana, and New Orleans in particular, is made up of African-African, elderly and veteran populations, many of whom were plunged into further poverty once their houses were damaged by floods [...] As a result, begging and panhandling in Louisiana {{is not just a matter}} of economics, but also of gender, race and age. Louisiana remains the third most impoverished state in the United States, with nearly 1 in 5 people living in poverty.|$|R

2500|$|Givers {{was formed}} in 2008 in Lafayette, Louisiana by Tiffany Lamson, Taylor Guarisco, Kirby Campbell, Josh LeBlanc, William Henderson, and Nick Stephan. The band knew one another {{from high school in}} Lafayette, where [...] "there's two or three clubs and {{everybody}} plays there and supports each other." [...] Guarisco had toured with a zydeco band, while the other future members dabbled in Cajun and jazz music. Lamson grew up with gospel music as her parents were pastors, and she sang in the church band; she instead focused on feeling the music emotionally while the other members studied music. The band's earliest origins date to when Hurricane <b>Katrina</b> <b>hit</b> in August 2005. Lamson had just started her freshman year at the University of New Orleans, where much of the band first met. Guarisco and Lamson were rooming together when the storm hit, leaving them with roughly 15 feet of water in their apartment. With school on hold and nowhere to live, the duo returned home with little to do, and began making music together and performing at open mic nights. While Lafayette was [...] "suitably anonymous" [...] before the disaster, nearly 30,000 people moved to the city following the tragedy, resulting an [...] "explosion in culture." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{storm surge}} from Hurricane <b>Katrina</b> that <b>hit</b> Pass Christian was {{estimated}} at 8.5 m (27.8 ft), which is the US record high, leveling Pass Christian up to half a mile inland from the shore; estimation of highest storm surges was complicated because high-water markers were also destroyed. Highway 90 along the beach was damaged, and the bridge over the Bay of St. Louis was thrown completely apart, not being reopened until a new bridge was partially completed in May 2007. (Connection was temporarily replaced by a ferry service.) Sewage contamination rendered the local water supply unusable, as some samples tested positive for more than 250 bacteria and parasites. By late September 2005, access was restricted south of the railroad tracks (about four blocks inland) without proper credentials, as crews continued to search for victims and clear debris. In early 2007, although rebuilding was underway {{in much of the}} city, a large portion of empty, deserted homes and other structures remain. Many residents were still living in FEMA trailers, and out-of-state volunteers were still needed for the rebuilding effort.|$|R
5000|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 20th century to 1980, New Orleans faced increasing residential segregation. Unemployment of blacks was as much as 10 times that of whites, and blacks paid a greater proportion of their income for housing than whites. In the 1970s, four times as many blacks had incomes placing them below the poverty level than whites, and by 1980 there was a belt along the undesirable backswamp of majority black residents. In addition to facilitating the growth of suburbs and advancing depopulation, the creation of Interstate 10 displaced many historically black neighborhoods [...] including Tulane/Gravier, Tremé/Lafitte and the 7th Ward. As individuals with financial and social mobility moved to suburbs, the poor, who were disproportionately African American [...] remained in low lying location within the city's core, making them especially susceptible to flood and storm damage. Although {{there are a variety of}} ways Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath affected groups differentially based on race and class, as journalist Eugene Robinson said, [...] "Environmental injustice began long before Hurricane <b>Katrina</b> ever <b>hit,</b> in the basic pattern of settlement in the city." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{economic}} {{effects of}} Hurricane <b>Katrina,</b> which <b>hit</b> Louisiana, Florida, Texas and Mississippi in late August 2005, were far-reaching. In 2006, the Bush administration sought over $100 billion for repairs and reconstruction in the region, {{making it the}} costliest natural disaster in US history. And this {{does not account for}} damage to the economy caused by potential interruption of the oil supply and exports of commodities such as cotton. Also, before Hurricane Katrina, the region supported approximately one million non-farm jobs, with 600,000 of them in New Orleans. One study, by Mark Burton and Michael J. Hicks estimated the total economic impact to Louisiana and Mississippi may exceed $150 billion.Hundreds of thousands of residents of southern Louisiana and Mississippi, including nearly everyone who lived in New Orleans, were left unemployed. No paychecks were being cashed and no money was being spent, and therefore no taxes were being collected by local governments. The lack of revenue will limit the resources of the affected communities and states for years to come. Before the storm, the region was already one of the poorest in America with one of the highest unemployment rates.|$|R
