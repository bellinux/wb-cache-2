50|$|The {{volunteer}} fire department {{for much of}} the early and mid-20th century used a truck with 3 tanks and a <b>front-mounted</b> <b>pump</b> (sometimes called the chemical truck), and a General-St. Louis truck that was acquired from Mason City. Both had open cockpits and could be hand cranked to start the engine. In the late 1950s the school bus barn burned and the department saved two International Metro buses. Some of the fire department members restored one Metro for the District and the District gave the other one to the department, which used it for rescue for quiet a few years.|$|E
