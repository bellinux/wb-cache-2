40|$|We {{examine the}} impact <b>of</b> {{different}} <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> fiscal <b>feedback</b> on debt {{in an economy}} with nominal rigidities where monetary policy is optimal. We look at {{the extent to which}} different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> fiscal <b>feedback</b> enhance or detract from the ability of the monetary authorities to stabilize output and inflation. Using an objective function derived from utility, we find the optimal level <b>of</b> fiscal <b>feedback</b> to be small. A clear discontinuity exists in the behavior of monetary policy and welfare on either side of this optimal level. As the extent <b>of</b> fiscal <b>feedback</b> increases, optimal monetary policy becomes less active because fiscal feedback tends to deflate inflationary shocks. However, this fiscal stabilization is less efficient than monetary policy, so welfare declines. In contrast, if fiscal feedback falls below some critical value, optimal monetary policy becomes strongly passive, and this passive monetary policy leads to a sharp deterioration in welfare. ...|$|R

40|$|Sensorimotor {{synchronization}} is {{the process}} by which we are able to synchronize a motor response with a sensory stimulus that occurs at predictable intervals over time. A common experimental paradigm for studying this process is finger tapping to a metronome. It has been found that finger trajectory is asymmetric and this asymmetry increases with timing accuracy, suggesting that the relatively high velocity of the finger flexion phase compared to the extension phase may provide proprioceptive feedback that aids in synchronization. In this study, we examined how the kinematics of the motor response varies in relation to changes in the frequency of occurrence of the stimulus and to changes in the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> sensory <b>feedback</b> during the motor response. Participants were asked to tap on three different surfaces offering varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> tactile <b>feedback</b> while synchronizing to a virtual metronome playing at one of two different rates. Motion capture equipment recorded their finger movement. It was expected that the greater the amount <b>of</b> sensory <b>feedback</b> from the tapping surface, the more symmetric the finger trajectory would become, as dependence on a high velocity phase could decrease and movement could more resemble the symmetric sinusoidal motion that models of motor control would predict for the repetitive to and fro movement of finger tapping {{in the absence of a}} synchronization constraint.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{variations}} in signal probability and varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> correct <b>feedback</b> on response bias were studied in a yes-no auditory signal detection task. The main {{finding was that}} the bias towards saying yes was an increasing function of the frequency <b>of</b> signal <b>feedback</b> events, but did {{not depend on the}} correctness <b>of</b> the <b>feedback.</b> Several learning models coupled with a simple psychophysical and decision model yielded predictions about overall biases and certain sequential statistics.

40|$|The {{capacity}} to rapidly adjust perceptual representations confers a fundamental advantage {{when confronted with}} a constantly changing world. Unexplored is how feedback regarding sensory judgments (top-down factors) interacts with sensory statistics (bottom-up factors) to drive long- and short-term recalibration of multisensory perceptual representations. Here, we examined {{the time course of}} both cumulative and rapid temporal perceptual recalibration for individuals completing an audiovisual simultaneity judgment task in which they were provided with varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>feedback.</b> We find that in the presence <b>of</b> <b>feedback</b> (as opposed to simple sensory exposure) temporal recalibration is more robust. Additionally, differential time courses are seen for cumulative and rapid recalibration dependent upon the nature <b>of</b> the <b>feedback</b> provided. Whereas cumulative recalibration effects relied more heavily on feedback that informs (i. e., negative feedback) rather than confirms (i. e., positive feedback) the judgment, rapid recalibration shows the opposite tendency. Furthermore, differential effects on rapid and cumulative recalibration were seen when the reliability <b>of</b> <b>feedback</b> was altered. Collectively, our findings illustrate that feedback signals promote and sustain audiovisual recalibration over the course of cumulative learning and enhance rapid trial-to-trial learning.

40|$|Our {{group is}} {{interested}} in the potential use of gas sensors for detection of key odorants in industry and as alternative sensory mechanisms for guidance control in robots. It has been recently shown that chemically modified, resonating quartz piezoelectric (QPZ) crystals exposed to different odorants, generate characteristic response patterns (termed "kinetic signatures"). To demonstrate their utility in an electronic olfactory system, artificial neural networks (ANNs) were trained using the back propagation method, to associate the kinetic signature responses of 6 differently treated sensors to 18 trialed odorants. Arranging each of the separate networks corresponding to each sensor in a layer-like fashion (hereafter referred to as tiers to avoid confusion with network layers), the weight states of the output processing elements (PEs) of the amalgamated ANN combine to produce weighted, two dimensional 'olfactory response maps' that uniquely identify each of the odorants.

We model the uncertainty in the arrivals and services via polyhedral uncertainty sets which are inspired from the limit laws of probability. Using the generalized central limit theorem, this framework allows to model heavy-tailed behavior characterized by bursts of rapidly occurring arrivals and long service times. We take a worst-case approach and obtain closed form upper bounds on the system time in a multi-server queue. These expressions provide qualitative insights which mirror the conclusions obtained in the probabilistic setting for light-tailed arrivals and services and generalize them {{to the case of}} heavy-tailed behavior. We also develop a calculus for analyzing a network of queues based on the following key principle: (a) the departure from a queue, (b) the superposition, and (c) the thinning of arrival processes have the same uncertainty set representation as the original arrival processes. The proposed approach (a) yields results with error percentages in single digits relative to simulation, and (b) is to a large extent insensitive to the number of servers per queue, network size, <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>feedback,</b> traffic intensity, and somewhat sensitive to the degree of diversity of external arrival distributions in the network...|$|E

40|$|Random {{errors are}} omnipresent in {{sensorimotor}} tasks due to perceptual and motor noise. The question is, are humans {{aware of their}} random errors on an instance-by-instance basis? The appealing answer would be ‘no ’ because it seems intuitive that humans would otherwise immediately correct for the errors online, thereby increasing sensorimotor precision. However, here we show the opposite. Participants pointed to visual targets with varying <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>feedback.</b> After movement completion participants indicated whether they believed they landed left or right of target. Surprisingly, participants ’ left/right-discriminability was well above chance, even without visual feedback. Only when forced to correct for the error after movement completion did participants loose knowledge about the remaining error, indicating that random errors can only be accessed offline. When correcting, participants applied the optimal correction gain, a weighting factor between perceptual and motor noise, minimizing end-point variance. Together these results show that humans optimally combine direct information about sensorimotor noise in the system (the current random error), with indirect knowledge about the variance of the perceptual and motor noise distributions. Yet, they only appear to do so offline after movement completion, not while the movement is still in progress, suggesting that during movement proprioceptive information i...|$|E
40|$|Elections, {{specially}} {{in countries such}} as Brazil with an electorate of the order of 100 million people, yield large-scale data-sets embodying valuable information on the dynamics through which individuals influence each other and make choices. In this work we perform an extensive analysis of data sets available for Brazilian proportional elections of legislators and city councillors throughout the period 1970 - 2012, which embraces two distinct political regimes: a military dictatorship and a democratic phase. Through the distribution P(v) of the number of candidates receiving v votes, we perform a comparative analysis of different elections in the same calendar and as a function of time. The distributions P(v) present a scale-free regime with a power-law exponent α which is not universal and appears to be characteristic of the electorate. Moreover, we observe that α typically increases with time. We propose a multi-species model consisting in a system of nonlinear differential equations with stochastic parameters that allows to understand the empirical observations.

40|$|We propose an {{alternative}} approach for studying queueing systems by employing robust optimization as opposed to stochastic analysis. While traditional stochastic queueing theory relies on Kolmogorov’s axioms of probability and models arrivals and services as renewal processes, we use the limit laws of probability as the axioms of our methodology and model the queueing systems primitives by uncertainty sets. In this framework, we obtain closed form expressions for the steady-state waiting times in multi-server queues with heavy-tailed arrival and service processes. These expressions are not available under traditional stochastic queueing theory for heavy-tailed processes, while they lead to the same qualitative insights for independent and identically distributed arrival and service times. We also develop an exact calculus for analyzing a network of queues with multiple servers based on the following key principle: a) the departure from a queue, b) the superposition, and c) the thinning of arrival processes have the same uncertainty set representation as the original arrival processes. We show that our approach, which we call the Robust Queueing Network Analyzer (RQNA) a) yields results with error percentages in single digits (for all experiments we performed) relative to simulation, b) performs significantly better than the Queueing Network Analyzer (QNA) proposed in Whitt (1983), and c) is {{to a large extent}} insensitive to the number of servers per queue, the network size, <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>feedback,</b> traffic intensity, and somewhat sensitive to the degree of diversity of external arrival distributions in the network...|$|E

More specifically, the focus is on examining the grouped impact of the factors. First, this research draws on existing research on the factors influencing customer satisfaction. Second, an empirical research is conducted to discover the combined effect of different factors on hand on customer satisfaction and on the other hand on efficiency. METHOD A novel method in marketing called fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis is the used method. It was chosen because it is suitable for a research with a small population and because it takes both quantitative and qualitative aspects into consideration. It also analyses the impact of factors combined together rather than as separate individuals. KEY FINDINGS The main findings include the notion that a factor can have a different impact on customer satisfaction and efficiency depending on which other factors it is combined with. Additionally, separate factors or the same factors in a different form influence customer satisfaction and efficiency. Hence, there are trade-offs while attempting to achieve very good levels of both customer satisfaction and efficiency. In addition, the results include findings related to individual factors. For example, it is indicated that a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>feedback</b> can have a positive effect on customer satisfaction.

Studio-based education, in which students apply ideas to a real site, has been seen as key to a well-rounded education in the built environment and planning professions. At the same time, traditional methods require a high degree of tutor time to be spent with students, which is increasingly impractical given resource constraints and increased class sizes. Drawing on research exploring the challenges posed by sustainable development and participatory processes in ecological planning, a core second year studio-based module at The University of Manchester was re-designed so as to meet these challenges. Key elements of the redesign include: use of the hands-on toolkit, Ketso, for creative thinking and synthesis of ideas within and across groups; mapping and layered spatial analysis; simulating aspects of community consultation, without directly contacting the community; effective use of Graduate Teaching Assistant time in giving feedback and assistance to students; and including an individual reflective learning journal as part of the assessment.

40|$|Neutrophil (PMN) {{activation}} by {{the yeast}} component zymosan involves the complement receptor type 3 (CD 11 b/CD 18). Recombinant human tumour necrosis factor-alpha (rhTNF-alpha) augmented the zymosan-stimulated leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4) release from PMN, reaching a fourfold increase at 10 (- 9) M. Co-incubation of PMN with 10 (- 9) M rhTNF-alpha and staurosporine {{resulted in a}} further dose-dependent increase, which became significantly greater than a purely additive effect at a staurosporine concentration of 10 nM. This synergy was maintained at all doses of staurosporine tested. In addition, doses of phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) that do not activate protein kinase C (PKC) (below 10 (- 9) M) also augmented the zymosan-stimulated release of LTB 4. However, doses of PMA above 10 (- 9) M progressively inhibited the response to levels below that of zymosan alone. Staurosporine at 50 nM completely prevented, and 10 (- 9) M rhTNF-alpha partially but significantly (P less than 0. 02 at 10 (- 8) M PMA, P less than 0. 01 at 10 (- 7) M PMA) reversed, this high-dose PMA inhibition. PKC activation thus opposes the priming effect of rhTNF-alpha on neutrophils, while PKC inhibition may enhance the ability of rhTNF-alpha to prime PMN for zymosan activation. The combined effect of rhTNF-alpha and staurosporine suggests an intracellular synergy rather than simply a direct action due to increased zymosan receptor expression. Thus {{there appear to be}} mechanisms whereby the responses of neutrophils may be augmented without activating PKC. Indeed, kinase activation may even exert a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>feedback</b> control that is antagonized by rhTNF-alpha treatment...|$|E
