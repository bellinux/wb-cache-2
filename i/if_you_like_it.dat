5|$|Borrowing {{from the}} French again, Planché {{introduced}} the revue (or review) to British theatre, as {{a commentary on}} recent events, particularly events in the theatre. His first revue, Success; or, a hit <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> was produced in 1825. He wrote another seven over the next 30 years, a peak of four in the years 1853–1855.|$|E
500|$|Primarily an uptempo latin pop track, [...] "Rabiosa" [...] {{additionally}} borrows influences from merengue {{and dance}} music. In the song, Shakira and Pitbull/El Cata trade verses regarding each other's sex appeal. English and Spanish words are mixed together in various lines, {{such as when}} Shakira sings [...] "Oye papi, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> mocha / Come get a little closer and bite me en la boca". Jennifer Schaffer from The Stanford Daily described Shakira and Pitbull's vocals as [...] "sultry" [...] and [...] "raspy," [...] respectively.|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Jacques Pépin {{wrote an}} article that called the {{inclusion}} of canned tuna the [...] "conventional choice", and recommended sauteed fresh tuna instead as [...] "more elegant". Mimi Sheraton disagrees, commenting, [...] "Salade Nicoise with fresh tuna is a travesty [...] [...] [...] <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> [...] you are wrong!" [...] In 1999, Pépin joined with Julia Child in a TV series, [...] Jacques and Julia: Cooking at Home. Each prepared a salad they called [...] "Near Nicoise". Child's version was a composed salad including tuna and anchovies canned in olive oil, [...] and blanched green beans. [...] Pépin's was a tossed salad including sauteed fresh tuna and potatoes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite good! Well, I suppose that's {{all you can}} say for <b>it</b> honestly. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it,</b> <b>it's</b> curious <b>you</b> didn't eat very much. Then, you see, I can cook, and I {{wanted to}} make a little feast to {{celebrate}} your beginning the job." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Tartar <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like,</b> <b>it's</b> {{much the}} same <b>if</b> <b>you</b> catch him. And it winds up with a girl--which is not surprisin'--who is to be expectorated--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fancy {{there are}} men who would not have thought that a great misfortune," [...] said Seaforth dryly. [...] "You could also, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>liked</b> <b>it,</b> do so still." ...|$|R
500|$|There {{was this}} huge scandal that {{originally}} [...] "Halo" [...] {{was meant to}} go to Leona. That was never the case... That song was written for Beyoncé. What happened was that Beyoncé waited long enough to record that song... I thought {{this would be a}} brilliant first single for Leona, which it would have... What I did was foolishly say to Leona's camp, [...] "I have it on hold for another A-list artist and I'm pretty sure they'll take it, but if they don't, I just want to know <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> enough to consider it". I sent it to them and they flipped on it. They loved it and instantly said they wanted to do it. I was like, [...] "Wait, wait, wait, no, it's not free yet!" ...|$|E
500|$|I've {{had this}} idea {{in my head}} for this show Tears of a Clown which is a {{combination}} of music and storytelling. Because {{at the end of the}} day I do think of myself as a story teller. But it's rough as f---, [...] so bear with me and give me all the support you can. It's from the heart. I chose to debut this work in progress, this rough rehearsal, here in Australia because I feel so bad about cancelling on you guys the last time. I'm sorry. You've been so patient, you waited for so long, I feel like I owe you a present, so this is your present... I want to make a disclaimer... If anyone thinks they came here to see a finished final show, there's the door. This is some brand spanking new shit. I don't know <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> raw.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{were mixed}} on Parker and Stone's {{elaborate}} April Fools' Day prank. Diane Werts of Newsday {{said of the}} episode, [...] "Fans rioted. Some jumped ship and never came back. The lesson: Pay off our expectations, or you'll be sorry." [...] Jim Minge of the Omaha World-Herald said South Park fans were [...] "duped" [...] by the episode. Philip Martin of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, who said in May 1998 the South Park phenomenon was [...] "dead", described the April Fools' prank as [...] "lamentable" [...] {{and part of the}} reason for the show's apparent decline. Others, however, praised Parker and Stone for making the move at the risk of upsetting fans. Tim Clodfelter of the Winston-Salem Journal said, [...] "It was a funny, clever move [...] quickly separated the fans who truly [...] "got" [...] humor from those who were just watching for the dirty jokes." [...] Jon Casimir of The Sydney Morning Herald said, [...] "It is gratifying, in an entertainment world dominated by market research and common denominators, to see a program that obviously doesn't care <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> or not." [...] However, he said the characterization of Terrance and Phillip was too thin to be particularly funny, and added that the novelty of the prank is lost in later years.|$|E
6000|$|... "Natural--absolutely natural," [...] she insisted. [...] "You can wet {{your finger}} and try <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like.</b> <b>It's</b> excitement. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> {{look into the}} depths of my {{wonderful}} eyes--I have got wonderful eyes, haven't I?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now then, {{what do you}} want?" [...] {{its owner}} said sharply, {{as she opened the}} door in reply to his knock. [...] "There's nothing for you here. You can look round <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like.</b> <b>It's</b> been all {{stripped}} clean days ago, so I tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, it's {{all well}} {{enough for you}} to talk. You're an Englishman, and you could wear a hat, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>liked.</b> <b>It</b> would be set down to character. But in an American it would be set down to greenness. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> were an American, you would have to wear a bonnet." ...|$|R
2500|$|In February 2015, Eddie Murphy {{stated that}} his cameo {{appearance}} in the pilot ironically doomed the show's chances: [...] "I was gonna be in the pilot, and they thought I should be recurring. I’m not gonna do Beverly Hills Cop on TV. I remember when they tested it — they had this little knob that you turn <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> or you don’t like it. So when Axel {{shows up in the}} pilot, some people turned the knob so much, they broke it. So the network decided 'if he isn’t recurring, then this isn’t gonna happen.' So it didn’t happen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Davis's trumpet and McLaughlin's guitar {{parts were}} heavily overdubbed for the recording. The overdubbing effect {{was created by}} {{superimposing}} part of Davis's trumpet solo onto other parts of it, through something Teo Macero calls a [...] "recording loop". Macero later said of this production technique, [...] "You hear the two parts and it's only two parts, but the two parts become four and they become eight parts. This was done over in the editing room and it just adds something to the music [...] I called [...] in and I said, 'Come in, I think we've got something you'll like. We'll try it on and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> you've got it.' He came in and flipped out. He said {{it was one of}} the greatest things he ever heard". DeJohnette's drums were also manipulated by Macero, who used an automatic switcher to have them rattle back and forth between the left and right speakers on the recording. In his book Running the Voodoo Down: The Electric Music of Miles Davis, Davis-biographer Phil Freeman describes this technique as [...] "100 percent Macero" [...] and writes of its significance to the track as a whole, stating: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will say}} {{making love to}} her, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> better; and gentlemen under these {{circumstances}} will sometimes become infatuated." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in the least; I was {{thinking}} of my people. They {{have no idea where}} I am,' answered Prince Roman. 'I'll engage to do as much for <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like.</b> <b>It's</b> certain that half of us at least shall be killed before the end, so there's an even chance of one of us surviving the other.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wild {{turkey or}} deer. Maybe both, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like.</b> But <b>it's</b> well to take wild meat slow. An' turkey--that 'll melt in your mouth." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Oh God!' said Birkin, 'don't be so matter-of-fact. Close {{the account}} {{in your own}} soul, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like.</b> <b>It</b> is there you can't close it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Twenty pounds," [...] {{repeated}} Miss Vickers, [...] "or {{four hundred}} shillings, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> better. If you {{wait a moment}} I’ll make it pennies." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, I will go {{five pounds}} even with you, and I will take five to one, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like,</b> that <b>it</b> does not last another month.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Call <b>it</b> affirmative <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like.</b> Only <b>it</b> has affirmed my indifference. Mind you, not {{my natural}} indifference--I HAD none. But my studied, my wilful renunciation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘My dear fellow!’ he wailed, ‘of {{course you}} can twist my words, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like.</b> <b>You</b> say <b>it</b> was an affair of honour. Well, I can’t, of course, tell you that—I can’t—I mean, you must see that that’s just the point! Was it? I don’t know.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "See! {{this is for}} you, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> more {{better than}} the thunder-and-lightning marbles, as Cousin Penny calls the one {{you were going to}} wear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Heathcote, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> We ain't {{particular}} to a shade out here {{as you are}} at home. He has been telling you about fires, has he?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{quite in}} earnest. I won't. If {{you do as}} I ask you, you shall talk to me till dinner-time, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> There. Now you may begin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can lump that hat <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> I dare <b>you</b> {{to knock}} it off--and anybody that'll take a dare will suck eggs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear fellow!" [...] he wailed, [...] "of {{course you}} can twist my words, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like.</b> <b>You</b> say <b>it</b> was an affair of honour.

6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Carrie, [...] "I think I understand. Still, there's the adventure, Jim. And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> didn't <b>like</b> <b>it</b> in England, <b>you</b> {{could come}} back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And Medlicot {{means to}} live by {{employing}} sheep-stealers and horse-stealers. You can go <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> You won't {{want me to go}} with you. Will you have the baggy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all--nor a {{glass of}} brandy in it, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> Indeed, Mr Lynch, I think that, just at present, {{it will be the}} better thing for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit down, Mr Crosbie," [...] {{said the}} countess, [...] "and {{let us have}} a little conversation. She shall sit by you, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> Nonsense, Alexandrina,--if he asks it!" ...|$|E
60|$|GIRL. Don't mind me talkin', ni-ice boy. I don't {{know anyone}} to talk to. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> I can be {{quiet as a}} mouse.|$|R
