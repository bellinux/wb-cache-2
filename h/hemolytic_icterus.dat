40|$|<b>HEMOLYTIC</b> <b>icterus,</b> in its literal sense, {{is a term}} so {{broad and}} {{inclusive}} that it may embrace {{a wide variety of}} conditions in which there is hemolysis of the erythrocytes and anemia. By common usage the term is applied to a more specific entity characterized not only by increased hemolysis and anemia, but by splenomegaly, increased fragility of the erythrocytes and evidences of bone marrow stimulation. This disease has been subdivided into the familial or congenital (Chauffard-Minkowski) type and the acquired (Hayem-Widal) type. The former represents a definite, clear-cut, clinical entity, whereas there is a diversity of opinion {{as to whether or not}} the acquired form should be so recognized. There are many who feel the term " acquired <b>hemolytic</b> <b>icterus</b> " should be eliminated, believing that all such cases are in reality manifestations of the familial or congenital form, and that there is a latent, inherent tendency of the erythrocytes in these individuals to hemolize, requiring only some infectious, toxic, or metabolic disturbance to bring this to light. 1 ' 2 A diagnosis of acquired <b>hemolytic</b> <b>icterus</b> has been made i...|$|E

40|$|Of 18 Hereford cattle {{imported}} into Quebec {{from the eastern}} U. S. A., five exhibited acute <b>hemolytic</b> anemia, <b>icterus,</b> depression, fever, anorexia and died; 11 were killed because they had positive or suspicious anaplasma titers and two were quarantined. Anaplasma marginale organisms {{were found in the}} erythrocytes of the sick animals by light and electron microscopy. The partial absence of erythrocytic plasmalemma on several electron photomicrographs suggested exit of the anaplasma bodies. Titers up to 1 : 320 in infected animals were found by the complement fixation test...|$|R
40|$|Abstract   Equine {{infectious}} anemia (EIA) {{is caused}} by the equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), which infects the animals in the family Equidae and is classified in the subfamily Lentivirinae of the family Retroviridae. The disease leads to fever, <b>hemolytic</b> anemias, <b>icterus,</b> depression and chronic weight loss. This study was conducted on 287 horses (200 male and 87 female) in Tabriz area in Iran {{in order to determine the}} seroprevalence of equine infectious anemia. Blood was collected from all horses and the sera were analyzed for the presence of antibodies to equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) using an ELISA test with IDEXX kit. The mean of Optical Density (OD) was 0. 372 ± 0. 016.   In these samples the lowest and highest levels were 0. 273 and 0. 511 respectively. There was no positive case according to the observed results. Mean OD was 0. 381 ± 0. 014 in male horses and 0. 387 ± 0. 010 in female horses, and there was no significant difference between the two groups (P= 0. 356). The horses were studied in four age groups: 1 - 3 (54 horses), 3 - 6 (125 horses), 6 - 9 (70 horses) and over 9 years old (38 horses). Mean OD was 0. 373 ± 0. 011, 0. 381 ± 0. 012, 0. 383 ± 0. 009, 0. 388 ± 0. 017 in these groups respectively. The results revealed that none of the horses were positive for antibodies to EIAV...|$|R
40|$|Case {{reports on}} the effect of {{hydroxyurea}} (HU) therapy for unstable hemoglobins (Hbs) are sparse; only three adult cases have been reported. We report for the first time {{on the effect of}} HU therapy in children carrying unstable Hbs. The first case concerns a female child with a familial history of chronic hemolytic anemia. She was diagnosed with Hb Volga (HBB: c. 83 C>A) at the age of 7 months. At age 6, treatment options were reconsidered due to increasing fatigue and decreasing Hb concentration. The second case also concerns a female child with chronic <b>hemolytic</b> anemia and <b>icterus</b> since the age of 5. She was diagnosed with Hb Koln (HBB: c. 295 G>A) at the age of 9. At age 10, treatment options were reconsidered due to decreased general condition and poor school performance. Both children were started on HU therapy. The child with Hb Volga showed reduced clinical symptoms and increased average Hb concentrations. She has been on HU therapy for over 7 years at preparation of this manuscript. The child with Hb Koln showed decreasing Hb concentrations upon start of therapy; clinical symptoms did not improve. Therapy was discontinued after 31 / 2 months. The Hb Volga case report suggests that HU therapy could improve clinical symptoms in some patients with unstable Hbs. Based on these and previously published cases, it was speculated that response can be predicted by the percentage of Hb F and reticulocyte counts...|$|R
40|$|Human {{liver tissue}} has been assayed to {{determine}} the amount of hemoglobin production factors in normal and abnormal states. Standardized dogs made anemic by blood removal have been used in this biological assay. Normal animal liver as control is rated as 100 per cent. Normal human liver tissue as compared with the normal animal control contains more of these hemoglobin production factors—a biological assay ratio of 120 to 160 per cent. Infections, acute and chronic, do not appear to modify these values, the concentration of hemoglobin-producing factors falling within the normal range. Pernicious anemia and aplastic anemia both show large liver stores of hemoglobin-producing factors—a biological assay ratio of 200 to 240 per cent. Therapy in pernicious anemia reduces these liver stores as new red cells are formed. Secondary anemia presents a low normal or subnormal liver store of hemoglobin-producing factors—an assay of 60 to 130 per cent. Hemochromatosis, erythroblastic anemia, and <b>hemolytic</b> <b>icterus</b> in spite of large iron deposits in the liver usually show a biological assay which is normal or close to normal. Polycythemia shows low reserve stores of hemoglobin-producing factors. Leukemias present a wide range of values discussed above. Hypoproteinemia almost always is associated with low reserve stores of hemoglobin-producing factors in the liver—biological assays of 60 to 80 per cent. Hypoproteinemia means a depletion of body protein reserve stores including the labile protein liver reserves—a strong indication that the prehemoglobin material (or globin) is related to these liver stores. Pregnancy, eclampsia, and lactation all may present subnormal liver stores of hemoglobin-producing factors. Exhaustion of protein stores lowers the barrier to infection and renders the liver very susceptible to many toxic substances. It should not be difficult to correct hypoproteinemia under these conditions and thus relieve the patient of a real hazard...|$|E
40|$|FROM {{the maze}} of {{confused}} terminology and the many classifications of the vague group of blood diseases called hemolytic anemia, only chronic familial hemolytic jaundice stands out as a definite symptom-complex in which the diagnosis is exact and the treatment satisfactory. The disease, though not common, is of sufficient frequency to excite suspicion and war-rant careful consideration in any patient with unexplained anemia with or without jaundice. This is evidenced by our group of 28 cases that have been seen at the University Hospital {{in the past three}} years. It is our purpose to present a brief clinical analysis of these cases together with their characteristic blood changes, the various complications and the indications for and the results of treatment. The study presents a fairly accurate cross section of the voluminous literature on the subject. The term chronic familial hemolytic jaundice will be used in preference to such varied names as hemolytic jaundice, <b>hemolytic</b> anemia, acholuric <b>icterus,</b> acholuric ictero-anemia, <b>hemolytic</b> splenomegaly, splenic anemia or chronic infectious anemia with splenomegaly. We may define chronic familial hemolytic jaundice as a chronic micro-spherocytic anemia, characterized by increased fragility of the red cells, reticulocytosis, acholuric icterus and splenomegaly. 1 ETIOLOGY Chronic familial hemolytic jaundice is a disease of all ages and of either sex. In our 28 cases there were 11 males and 17 females; their ages varied from 3 to 63 years. The age at which symptoms first appeared, however, was usually within the first two decades of life. Occasionally, sub-clinical evidence of the disease would remain latent and unsuspected for many years and be discovered only if the individual or some other member of the family was found to be an active clinical case...|$|R
