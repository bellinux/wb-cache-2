5|$|Hans Karl von Winterfeldt {{was born}} at Vanselow Castle (now in Siedenbrünzow, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern) in Swedish Pomerania. His {{education}} was imperfect, and in later life he always regretted his lack of <b>familiarity</b> with the French language.|$|E
5|$|Critics praised Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike as {{a humorous}} {{adaptation}} of Chekhov themes that doesn't require <b>familiarity</b> with Chekhov. The original Broadway production {{proved to be}} a commercial success, recouping its $2.75 million investment in under four months. In 2013, it won the Tony Award for Best Play and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play, among other awards.|$|E
5|$|Fallout: New Vegas {{received}} positive reviews, with critics {{praising the}} gameplay improvements and expanded content over Fallout 3, while criticizing <b>familiarity</b> and technical issues. As of November 8, 2010, the game had shipped 5 million copies worldwide, achieving revenue of $300 million. Electronic Entertainment Design and Research, a market research firm, {{estimates that the}} game has sold 11.6 million copies worldwide by 2015.|$|E

5|$|Lem {{singled out}} only one American science fiction writer for praise, Philip K. Dick, {{for example in}} his 1986 English-language {{anthology}} of his critical essays, Microworlds. In fact, initially Lem held an equally low opinion of Philip K. Dick together with the bulk of American science fiction, explaining later {{this was due to}} limited <b>familiarity</b> with Dick's work.|$|E
5|$|Traditional Victorian dancing fairies and elves {{appear in}} much of Tolkien's early poetry, and have {{influence}} upon his later works {{in part due to}} the influence of a production of J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan in Birmingham in 1910 and his <b>familiarity</b> with the work of Catholic mystic poet, Francis Thompson which Tolkien had acquired in 1914.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{definition of}} Mitică and mitici {{was adopted by}} many inhabitants of Transylvania, who used the terms in reference to either Bucharest-based politicians or inhabitants of the city at large, and contrasted them with their counterparts to the northwest. The character has thus evolved to include a stereotypical view of contemporary Bucharesters or Wallachians, one which depicts them as , arrogant, aggressive and cunning. In other contexts, the mitici {{may be seen as}} not having an adequate <b>familiarity</b> with the culture of Transylvania, and are associated with the Balkans (whereas Transylvania is identified with Central Europe).|$|E
60|$|In this {{agreeable}} {{way would}} Mr. Slang rattle on, speedily making himself {{the centre of}} the conversation, and addressing graceful <b>familiarities</b> to all the gentlemen and ladies round him.|$|R
60|$|He {{began by}} {{understanding}} {{far too much}} of the bishop's illness, and he insisted on various <b>familiarities</b> with the bishop's heart and tongue and eye and knee that ruffled the bishop's soul.|$|R
60|$|Lippy's mother, a large-eyed, good-looking young woman, with {{insufficient}} clothing--at {{least in}} the estimate of a Ratingaite--was transfixed {{the first time she}} saw her little one practise her <b>familiarities</b> on their demigod.|$|R
5|$|Although Apollonius {{wrote his}} poem in the 3rd century BC, the {{composition}} of the story of the Argonauts is earlier than Odyssey, which shows <b>familiarity</b> with the exploits of Jason (the wandering of Odysseus may have been partly founded on it). In ancient times the expedition was regarded as a historical fact, an incident in the opening up of the Black Sea to Greek commerce and colonization. It was also extremely popular, forming a cycle to which a number of local legends became attached. The story of Medea, in particular, caught the imagination of the tragic poets.|$|E
5|$|Bache's {{strategy}} for presenting these works {{was one of}} <b>familiarity.</b> He performed two-piano arrangements of Liszt's orchestral works prior to the debuts of the original versions, and performed some of Liszt's symphonic poems shortly after they had been premiered at the Crystal Palace. He also provided informative, scholarly program notes, written by leading musical analysts and intimates in the Liszt circle. The English musical press, while generally hostile to the music he presented, noted and appreciated Bache's efforts. Liszt remained grateful; without Bache, he acknowledged, his music might not have gained the foothold that it did.|$|E
5|$|But I'm a Cheerleader was Babbit's {{first feature}} film. It was {{inspired}} by an article about conversion therapy and her childhood <b>familiarity</b> with rehabilitation programs. She used {{the story of a}} young woman finding her sexual identity to explore the social construction of gender roles and heteronormativity. The costume and set design of the film highlighted these themes using artificial textures in intense blues and pinks.|$|E
60|$|Somewhat {{annoyed by}} these {{conversational}} <b>familiarities,</b> Captain Delano turned curiously upon the attendant, then glanced inquiringly at his master; but, as if long wonted to these little informalities, neither master nor man {{seemed to understand}} him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes." [...] She {{stood at}} the door. Now that she had carried out her preposterous impulse {{to see what he}} was like, she was cold, she was as ready to detect <b>familiarities</b> as the virtuous Miss Ella Stowbody.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't Duchess ME, sir. Did you not promise {{they should}} not speak; and hasn't that horrid tipsy wretch offered to embrace me? Didn't his monstrous wife sicken me with her odious <b>familiarities?</b> Call my people, Tufthunt! Follow me, my children!" ...|$|R
5|$|Due to the rainout and the racers' lack of <b>familiarity</b> {{with the}} EuroSpeedway, CART {{cancelled}} qualifying for the American Memorial. The starting grid {{was determined by}} drivers' order in the season points standings. The pole position went to de Ferran, though {{due to the lack}} of qualifying, he was not awarded a point in the standings as was customary for pole winners. Bräck earned second position since he held a tie-breaker over Castroneves, who started third, and Andretti began the race in fourth.|$|E
5|$|During 1913-19, {{advocates of}} woman {{suffrage}} {{drew on the}} educational and advertising techniques of the national parties and the lobbying tactics of the women's club movement. They also tapped into popular culture, successfully using popular symbolism and traditional ideals to adapt community festivals and social gatherings {{to the task of}} political persuasion. The Dallas Equal Suffrage Association developed a suffrage campaign based on social values and community standards. Community and social occasions served as recruiting opportunities for the suffrage cause, blunting its radical implications with the <b>familiarity</b> of customary events and dressing it in the values of traditional female behavior, especially propriety.|$|E
5|$|Greatly {{expanding}} his <b>familiarity</b> {{with historical}} and social subjects, Kogălniceanu also {{began work on}} his first volumes: a pioneering study on the Romani people and the French-language Histoire de la Valachie, de la Moldavie et des Valaques transdanubiens ("A History of Wallachia, Moldavia, and of Transdanubian Vlachs", the first volume in a synthesis of Romanian history), {{both of which were}} first published in 1837 inside the German Confederation. He was becoming repulsed by the existence of Roma slavery in his country, and in his study, cited the example of active abolitionists in Western countries.|$|E
60|$|How shall I address you? Dear Bernard, or Sir? It doesn't matter. I {{am going}} to do one of the few good actions of my life: and <b>familiarities</b> or formalities matter nothing to a woman who lies on her deathbed.|$|R
6000|$|She {{rose and}} {{approached}} him. In the past {{days of the}} honeymoon and its sweet <b>familiarities,</b> he had sometimes taken her on his knee. He took her on his knee now, and put his arm round her. [...] "Kiss me," [...] he said.|$|R

"That, in the Beginning of June, 1741, he {{observed}} a Man (whom he described), and afterwards {{found it was}} Lord Talbot, to meet the Dutchess as she was walking alone in the Fields near that Place; and thereupon mentioned adulterous <b>Familiarities</b> which passed between them." ...|$|R
5|$|In June 1985 Goldschmidt {{announced}} his candidacy for Oregon Governor. His name <b>familiarity</b> {{and access to}} large donations through his business and political ties made him the Democratic front runner. He easily defeated Oregon State Senator Edward N. Fadeley in the May 1986 Democratic primary. Goldschmidt defeated Republican Secretary of State Norma Paulus in the 1986 general election 52% to 48%, succeeding two-term Republican Governor Vic Atiyeh, becoming the state's 33rd governor.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} create <b>familiarity</b> with a common-day setting and tone, Vaughan made this story arc include various {{references}} to current popular culture, including television series, films, and celebrities such as , the Matrix trilogy, and Dr. Phil. Vaughan even makes references to real-world events, such as the Menendez brothers' shootings, the Beltway sniper attacks, Saddam Hussein's hiding and the O. J. Simpson murder case.|$|E
5|$|Johnny Rioux, who had {{produced}} Flatfoot 56's last album, Black Thorn, {{was chosen as}} the album's producer. The band felt that having the same producer improved communication and allowed the band to work more freely. According to frontman Tobin Bawinkel, this <b>familiarity</b> allowed Rioux to encourage the band to advance musically and think differently. During January 2012, the band recorded the entire album at the Atlas Studios in Chicago, Illinois.|$|E
60|$|He rose before her, {{as he said}} this, so {{soft and}} fair, so rich, {{in spite of what}} might worry him, in {{restored}} <b>familiarities,</b> that it gave a bright blur to the meaning--to what would otherwise perhaps have been the palpable promise--of the words.|$|R
5000|$|Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal {{acknowledged}} {{the cast and}} {{the look of the}} film and, despite some <b>familiarities</b> with the film's conflict, praised Allen's work on the film. He wrote, [...] "For the filmmaker who brought these intertwined universes into being, the film represents new energy in a remarkable career.".|$|R
6000|$|Winterbourne {{stood looking}} after them; {{he was indeed}} puzzled. He lingered beside the lake {{for a quarter of}} an hour, turning over the mystery of the young girl's sudden <b>familiarities</b> and caprices. But the only very {{definite}} conclusion he came to was that he should enjoy deucedly [...] "going off" [...] with her somewhere.|$|R
5|$|Most of Caragiale's prose is {{interconnected}} through {{allusions to}} himself, and, occasionally, the narratives discreetly refer to one another. Although his texts {{are characterized by}} precision in defining the moment and location for the plot, the general lines of the narratives are often subject to a calculated fragmentation, an innovative technique which, Vartic writes, attests the author's <b>familiarity</b> with Antoine Furetière's vision. Vartic also indicates that Balzac's La Comédie humaine, in particular its Thirteen cycle—which {{is known to have}} been one of the books Caragiale treasured most—, influenced the general structure of his stories.|$|E
5|$|Released in North America on September17, 1999, American Beauty was {{positively}} received by critics and grossed over $356million worldwide. Reviewers praised most {{aspects of the}} production, with particular emphasis on Mendes, Spacey, and Ball; criticism focused on the <b>familiarity</b> of the characters and setting. DreamWorks launched a major campaign to increase the film's chances of Academy Award success; at the 72nd Academy Awards the following year, the film won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (for Spacey), Best Original Screenplay, and Best Cinematography. It was nominated for and won many other awards and honors, mainly for the direction, writing, and acting.|$|E
5|$|Risk to {{defensive}} capabilities: Security {{forces are}} not changing armaments annually, and thus small arms manufacturers need civilians as key customers. Crippling of civilian firearms market would likely lead to end of firearms manufacturing in the Czech Republic. At the same time, <b>familiarity</b> with semi-automatic versions of army rifles by civilians {{is a clear}} defensive advantage in case these {{people need to be}} drafted to defend the country.|$|E
50|$|Paiśācī is {{a largely}} unattested {{literary}} {{language of the}} middle kingdoms of India mentioned in Prakrit and Sanskrit grammars of antiquity. It is found grouped with the Prakrit languages, with which it shares some linguistic <b>familiarities,</b> but is not considered a spoken Prakrit by the grammarians because it was purely a literary language, but also due to its archaicism.|$|R
50|$|Henry Blanke {{who served}} as the {{producer}} of this film had also produced The Nun's Story in 1959 starring Audrey Hepburn. The Sins of Rachel Cade had some <b>familiarities</b> to that story particularly with the lead character: a religious female working to help during wartime. Also, Peter Finch plays an atheistic authority figure in both films.|$|R
6000|$|But {{this was}} an {{opportunity}} not to be lost by the honest steward, who, from affection and long services, had been indulged in <b>familiarities</b> exceeding any other of his master's establishment. He very deliberately helped himself to a glass of wine, and drawing near {{the seat of the}} bride-elect, with an humble reverence, commenced his speech as follows: ...|$|R
