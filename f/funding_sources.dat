5|$|Netball gained Olympic {{recognition}} in 1995 after 20 years of lobbying. Although {{it has never}} been played at the Summer Olympics, politicians and administrators have been campaigning to have it included in the near future. Its absence from the Olympics has been seen by the netball community as a hindrance in the global growth of the game by limiting access to media attention and <b>funding</b> <b>sources.</b> Some <b>funding</b> <b>sources</b> became available with {{recognition in}} 1995, including the International Olympic Committee, national Olympic committees, national sport organisations, and state and federal governments.|$|E

5|$|Although {{multiple}} <b>funding</b> <b>sources</b> {{were originally}} {{considered by the}} NEDA to fund the airport's construction, {{it was decided that}} the project should avail of an official development assistance facility offered by the Japanese government through the then-newly formed Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). After almost two years of negotiations, and after initially refusing to bankroll the project, the JBIC extended a 6.2 billion peso (US$152million) loan to the Philippine government in August 2000.|$|E

Additional charges were assessed as follows: Every province receiving power from the Three Gorges Dam had to pay ¥7.00 per MWh extra. Other provinces had to pay an additional charge of ¥4.00 per MWh. The Tibet Autonomous Region pays no surcharge.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, NuScale's largest investor, Kenwood Group, was {{investigated}} by the Securities Exchange Commission and later plead guilty to operating a Ponzi scheme. The SEC investigation {{was not related to}} any of Kenwood's dealings with NuScale, but Kenwood's assets were frozen just as NuScale was expecting additional funding. The company started making staffing and pay cuts as executives looked for new <b>funding</b> <b>sources</b> and most of the company's employees were laid off within a few months.|$|E

5|$|During World War I, the {{compound}} {{was used by}} the Turkish army and its allies as a barracks. From 1921 to 1927, Theodor Schneller resumed management of the orphanage, overseeing the modernization of the property with electrical and sewage installations, as well as new machinery for the various workshops. His son Ernst directed the orphanage from 1927 until its confiscation by the British army in 1940. The orphanage's German <b>funding</b> <b>sources</b> were severely curtailed during the 1930s when the Nazi government of Germany banned citizens from sending funds abroad.|$|E
5|$|Growing {{weary of}} his workload, Gray {{and his wife}} {{departed}} {{on a trip to}} Britain, Egypt (for three months), and Switzerland in September 1868. It was during the winter spent in Egypt that Gray first grew his white beard. They returned in autumn 1869. In early 1872 Gray tried to resign his professorship and garden duties still with no replacement for himself. He proposed only looking after the herbarium and writing books in exchange for the rent of the house in which he and his wife lived on the university grounds. Due to the way the finances of the <b>funding</b> <b>sources</b> were handled and the lack of a replacement, Gray was unable to resign at that time.|$|E
5|$|After Sesame Streets initial success, the CTW {{began to}} think about its {{survival}} beyond the development and first season of the show, since their <b>funding</b> <b>sources</b> were composed of organizations and institutions that tended to start projects, not sustain them. Government funding ended by 1981, so the CTW developed other activities, including unsuccessful ventures into adult programs, the publications of books and music, international co-productions, interactive media and new technologies, licensing arrangements, and programs for preschools. By 2005, income from the CTW's international co-productions of the series was $96 million. By 2008, the Sesame Street Muppets accounted for $15–17 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees. Cooney resigned as CEO during 1990; David Britt was named as her replacement. On June 5, 2000, the CTW changed its name to Sesame Workshop to better represent its work which included non-television activities, and Gary Knell became CEO. H. Melvin Ming replaced Knell during 2011. During 2014, Ming was succeeded by Jeffrey D. Dunn.|$|E

5|$|In 1991 and 1992, {{the median}} strip {{of the entire}} freeway was {{significantly}} widened to accommodate the Joondalup railway line, being built under the Northern Suburbs Transit System project. The line was to {{be located in the}} middle of the road reserve, between the freeway carriageways. At the time, the northbound and southbound carriageways, between Loftus Street and McDonald Street, were positioned next to each other, with space for future widening located on the eastern side of the road reserve. Initially, three new road bridges were constructed over Vincent Street, Powis Street, and Scarborough Beach Road. Once the road bridges had been completed and surfacing works completed, the southbound carriage was relocated, creating the required space for the railway line construction. Additional lanes were constructed in the realigned section, funded from regular road <b>funding</b> <b>sources,</b> whilst the bridges and some associated works were included as part of the costs for the Northern Suburbs Transit System project.|$|E
5|$|Restoration {{of most of}} {{the canal}} does not present major problems, but {{challenges}} are presented by the final sections at both ends. The original route to join the Trent has been severed by the building of the A52 road. A route was identified which followed the course of the Polser Brook, which passes under the A52 {{to the north of the}} canal, but by 2009, three possible solutions were under consideration. These pose additional problems in finding funding, since they do not count as restoration, and many of the traditional <b>funding</b> <b>sources</b> are not then available. At Grantham, an embankment carrying the A1 road blocks the line of the canal, and the terminal basin has been filled in. There are plans for a tunnel under the A1 as part of a cycle route to improve access to Grantham, and the basin could be redeveloped in due course.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, the Multnomah County Library began distributing {{books to}} neighborhoods outside {{downtown}} Portland. A reading room {{was established in}} the Woodstock neighborhood's fire station building in 1908; later that year it was recognized as a branch of Multnomah County Library. Deposit stations, containing packing crates that turned into two-shelf bookcases holding up to 50 books each, were often set up within fire stations or private homes. Woodstock received its deposit station, a collection of children's books housed within a public school, in 1909, becoming one of fifteen outlying service areas. On May 16, 1911, the Woodstock deposit station was replaced by a sub-branch library, supplying more reading material for adults and children but without the reference works and other library services offered at regular branches. The collection was moved to a larger storefront facility, west of SE 44th on SE Woodstock Boulevard, on September 12, 1914. The library achieved full branch status in 1917, offering a collection and services comparable to other branches. In 1918, the Woodstock branch and several others were threatened with closure after employees received a $10 per month salary increase, but <b>funding</b> <b>sources</b> helped to defray the additional expense. Along with other county libraries, the branch closed between November 1 and November 16 in response to the 1918 flu pandemic.|$|E

5|$|More than 400 student {{clubs and}} {{organizations}} operate on Duke's campus. These include numerous student government, special interest, and service organizations. Duke Student Government (DSG) charters and provides {{most of the}} funding for other student groups and represents students' interests when dealing with the administration. The Duke University Union (DUU) is the school's primary programming organization, serving a center of social, cultural, intellectual and recreational life. Cultural groups are provided funding directly from the university via the Multicultural Center {{as well as other}} institutional <b>funding</b> <b>sources.</b> One of the most popular activities on campus is competing in sports. Duke has 37 , and several intramural teams that are officially recognized. Performance groups such as Hoof 'n' Horn, the country's second-oldest student-run musical theater organization, a cappella groups, student bands, and theater organizations are also prominent on campus. As of the 2016–2017 school year, there are seven a cappella groups recognized by the Duke University A Cappella Council: Deja Blue, Lady Blue, Out of the Blue, the Pitchforks, Rhythm & Blue, Something Borrowed Something Blue, and Speak of the Devil. The Duke University mock trial team won the national championship in 2012. The Duke University Student Dining Advisory Committee provides guidance to the administration on issues regarding student dining, life, and restaurant choices.|$|E
5|$|Voter {{approval}} of the referendum created a public–private partnership. The Washington State Public Stadium Authority was created to oversee public ownership of the stadium, exhibition center, and parking garage complex. Allen purchased the Seahawks and formed First & Goal Inc. to build and operate the facility. The budget for the project was $430million. Of this cost, $44million was allotted to build the Event Center, $26million for the parking garage, and $360million for the stadium. First & Goal was to cover cost overruns and pay up to $130million of the project while the contribution from the public was capped at $300million. The public funding package included new sports-related state lottery games, taxes on the facility's admissions and parking, sales tax credits and deferrals, and an eight-year extension of the 2% tax on hotel rooms in King County. The taxes on admissions and parking are set at 2% {{to pay off the}} project's tax-exempt bonds. Those taxes will be kept below the authorized 10% to preserve the tax-exempt status, but the percentage will be increased to the full amount when the bonds are completely paid in 2021. At such time, they will become dedicated <b>funding</b> <b>sources</b> for maintenance and modernization of the facilities.|$|E

40|$|What are {{the factors}} {{affecting}} university researchers in {{their decision to}} choose one type of <b>funding</b> <b>source</b> over the other? One such factor is the perceptions of individuals toward the costs and the rewards {{that are associated with}} the collaboration. Therefore, it was hypothesized that when researchers maintain low level of dependency on external support, they will tend to prefer the collaboration with a <b>funding</b> <b>source</b> which is perceived to provide most rewards and least costs among all sources. Faculty at five doctoral universities in the USA responded to a mailed questionnaire. The results suggested that most of those who regarded a specific <b>funding</b> <b>source</b> as providing the most rewards or the least costs preferred this source. The paper discusses the implications of the findings, {{and the role of the}} federal government as the major <b>funding</b> <b>source</b> amongst all sources...|$|R
