40|$|Abstract. Coating pore {{structure}} of low <b>gloss</b> <b>coated</b> paper based on different pigment blends was analyzed using mercury intrusion method in this paper. The {{results show that}} pore size of coating layer structure of low <b>gloss</b> <b>coated</b> paper ranges from 20 nm- 500 nm, and the range from 500 nm- 5000 nm is mainly from base paper and interactions between coating color and base paper. Printability of coated paper can be well related with coating {{pore structure}}. Print gloss is strongly influenced by pore size and pore volume. Large pore diameters and small pore volume of coating layer structure can improve print gloss. Ink density increases with the increasing of pore diameter while the pore volume is kept constant. The increasing of pore volume of coat layer structure will improve capillary absorption and then improve ink absorption. The control of coating pore structure {{is very important for}} producing low <b>gloss</b> <b>coated</b> paper...|$|R
40|$|High quality reproductions made by {{prepress}} operators {{were studied}} {{in order to}} derive gamut mapping strategies. Ektachrome transparencies were reproduced on <b>gloss</b> <b>coated</b> and newsprint hard copy media, and the implicit mapping strategies in dimensions of hue, lightness and chroma were analyzed. The results supported some elements of the CARISMA gamut mapping algorithm, including a shift in hue towards the colorant primaries of the reproduction media and (for <b>gloss</b> <b>coated</b> media only) linear lightness scaling from the minimum and maximum L* lightness of the image {{to those of the}} reproduction media. Compression of lightness and chroma towards the achromatic axis was found to be non-linear, and to have a variable convergence point. A gamut mapping algorithm incorporating these features (Graphic Arts Media Mapping Algorithm or GAMMA) was compared to other mapping methods in a transparency-to-newsprint workflow. The experiment compared different methods of determining the achromatic convergence point in simultaneous lightness-chroma compression, and compared linear compression against a nonlinear distance-weighted compression. Non-linear compression methods and variable, lightness and chroma dependent convergence points performed better than those with linear compression and fixed convergence points...|$|R

40|$|This {{experiment}} uses four experimental sickles containing flint and novaculite blades {{to harvest}} wet, growing grass and mature, dry rye {{in an effort}} to determine the differences in the development of sickle polish and other use wear traces caused by moisture content and other plant characteristics. During harvesting, samples of harvested material averaging about two handfuls were collected. These samples were massed, dried, and massed again to determine moisture content of the plants. The sickles were each used for approximately 13 hours. Each blade was then cast using high resolution dental epoxy for microscopic inspection. An edge survey was conducted along each blade starting at 100 x magnification and increasing as needed to 200 x. Microscopic examination of the sickle blades shows varying development of sickle wear stages. The flint blades used to harvest wet grass show higher levels of development of sickle gloss overall, with sickle <b>gloss</b> continuously <b>coating</b> the surface of the stone. The novaculite blades used to harvest wet grass show slightly lower levels of development of sickle gloss, with <b>gloss</b> discontinuously <b>coating</b> the surface of the stone. Both sickles used to harvest dry rye show barely developed sickle gloss, with gloss existing in isolated, discontinuous patches. The blades used to harvest wet grass show increased numbers of highly rounded microplating margins when compared to the rye sickles. Additionally, the difference in the abrasive nature of the plants generated different forms of striations. The tougher, more abrasive rye heavily striated the surface of the blades. The softer, fibrous grass produced finer striations {{on the surface of the}} blades. Microscopic inspection of the blades shows the process of rounding over the edge is likely a tandem process between edge abrasion and microplating, with the abrasion occurring first. While it is clear that moisture content affects the development of sickle gloss, other variables such as plant density, hardness, and abrasiveness were not controlled for and, therefore, potentially play an important role...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} {{evaluation of}} electrostatic spray and 'hot dipping' fluidized bed to deposit two different organic paints {{belonging to the}} class of thermoplastic (PPA 571, an alloy of acid modified polyolefins) and thermoset (TGIC-free transparent pigmented bronze polyester) powders was performed. Visual appearance of the investigated coatings was evaluated by colour, <b>gloss</b> and <b>coating</b> thickness measurements {{as well as by}} the determination of the surface morphologies. Micro-mechanical performance of the coatings was assessed by progressive load scratch tests. 'Hot dipping' fluidized bed is found a fast deposition technique as, after substrate pre-heating, it takes just few seconds to have the part completely powder coated. On the other hand, electrostatic spray deposition is a potentially selective coating technique, but it lasts longer (generally, 6 - 15 s) and, moreover, the coated parts must be post-cured for long time (at least, 15 min) and at high temperature (150 - 200 °C) to give rise to the formation of continuous films. Indeed, whilst 'hot dipping' fluidized bed is found particularly suitable for the deposition of thick and smooth thermoplastic coatings, electrostatic spray deposition is found the most viable technique to deposit thinner and highly scratch and wear resistant thermoset coatings. © 2012 Elsevier B.

However, {{it is well known}} that the gloss phenomenon involves more than can be represented by a single number. A recently developed instrument called a microgoniophotometer has been applied to the characterization of paper gloss. The Bi-directional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) plots generated by this device were shown to be related quantitatively and directly to Fresnel 2 ̆ 7 s law of specular reflection and to the surface roughness of the sample. Unlike standard gloss meter measurements, the BRDF enables the analyst to distinguish between effects of surface roughness and the Fresnel reflectance factor. Moreover, the analysis provides a way to characterize quantitatively the importance of sub-surface specular reflections to the overall <b>gloss</b> of a <b>coated</b> paper...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the preparation of}} heterogeneous latexes, which may serve as binders in coating applications, and the characterization of these. The latexes were prepared in two-stage seeded emulsion polymerization. The seed latexes used were polystyrene, whose properties had been changed by copolymerization with methacrylic acid (MAA) or divinyl benzene. The second-stage polymers were copolymers of styrene-co-isoprene-co-MAA or styrene-co-butadiene-co-MAA with varying compositions. The monomers in {{the second stage of}} polymerization were added either as a batch, or as a semi-continuous operation during the whole of the second stage or during various periods. The hydrophilicity of the polymeric phases was found to affect the particle morphology to a great extent. It was possible to change the particle morphology from an inverted core-shell to a core-shell morphology simply by adding small amounts of MAA to the monomer mixture used in the second stage of polymerization. Crosslinking of the seed particles had an even stronger effect on the morphology development. Increased amounts of isoprene and MAA, as well as an increased phase ratio between the second-stage polymer and the seed was found to increase deviations between particle sizes obtained by TEM and QELS. Monomer swelling experiments showed {{that it was possible to}} estimate the monomer volume fraction at which the seed polymer glass transition temperature (Tg) and the so-called gel point occurred, through pressure measurements. When the pressure was monitored in the copolymerization of butadiene and styrene, the conversion at which crosslinking began was detected as an irregularity on the pressure curve plotted as a function of the second-stage monomer conversion. Films made from the heterogeneous latexes were found to consist of two phases with the hard seed particles remaining as particles within the films. Mechanical measurements on the films showed that films made from latexes with crosslinked seed particles having irregular shapes, had the highest mechanical strength due to inter-particle contacts. Films made from latexes with core-shell morphologies exhibited lower mechanical strength due to the smooth seed particle structures left in the film. When latexes with crosslinked seed particles of irregular shapes were used as binders in model paper coating applications, they increased the porosity, gave greater light scattering ability and higher <b>coating</b> <b>gloss</b> of the <b>coating</b> layer, compared with latexes having core shell morphologies, due to retarded shrinkage of the coating during drying...|$|R
40|$|Gloss {{is one of}} {{the optical}} {{properties}} of primary concern to papermakers due to its strong impact on visual perception. In order to improve <b>gloss</b> of <b>coated</b> papers, it is necessary to better understand the relationship governing the behaviour of gloss as a function of surface texture attributes of coated paper. Since pigment represents between 80 to 95 % in weight of any coating colour, pigment characteristics, such as particle size, size distribution, and morphology, play a fundamental role in determining the coating structure. In addition, intensive calendering is often used to achieve a high sheet gloss, but can cause a significant increase in gloss variation (besides to a reduction in bulk). In this study, macro gloss, microgloss and microgloss nonuniformity of laboratory coated paper samples containing seven different delaminated and undelaminated kaolin clays with various particle size distributions were studied as a function of calendering conditions and coat weight. It was found that the average microgloss, given as average gray level, is strongly related to the macro gloss measured using the standard glossmeters. In addition, higher sheet average gloss corresponds to a larger gloss variability at the micro scale. It was also found that by increasing the calendering temperature from 28 to 150 oC, the average microgloss and the microgloss nonuniformity increased while the RMS surface heights decreased. For most samples, increasing the calendering temperature resulted in a decrease in surface roughness, σh. A semi-empirical model based on Alexander-Katz and Barrera’s approach of the Kirchhoff theory can be successfully used to identify key surface parameters for gloss and gloss nonuniformity. It showed that the average microgloss of the coated paper is strongly dependent on the surface texture parameter (LC/λ) /(σh/λ) 2. In addition, the microgloss variability of these coated papers also exhibited a strong linear correlation with the surface texture parameter (LC/λ) /(σh/λ) 2, but the relationship itself was found to be specific to each pigment type...|$|R

40|$|Previously, we {{have shown}} that {{coatings}} formulated with fumed silica pigments are capable of producing glossy inkjet media, {{despite the presence of}} these coating cracks, caused by shrinkage of the coating layer. However, their high cost and the inability to run them at high solids (> 30 % solids) limits their commercial application. Raising the coating solids with the addition of conventional pigments reduces the amount of shrinkage that occurs during drying, and thereby reduces the coating cracks, improving the final <b>gloss</b> of the <b>coating</b> layer. In this research, the solids of fumed silica coating systems were increased by adding co-pigments of different particle sizes. Fumed silica was used as the main pigment and precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) and ultra fine ground calcium carbonate (UFGCC) were used as co-pigments. The ratio of fumed silica to co-pigments were 100 : 0, 90 : 10, 80 : 20, 70 : 30, 60 : 40, 50 : 50, 0 : 100. These blends of pigments were previously shown to produce high gloss and good printability. The coatings were applied using Meyer rods to obtain a coat weight of 10 g / m 2 on one side. The optical brightness, printability, ink density, and ink gloss were compared. Based on the findings, it is concluded that the co-pigment systems had optical properties and printing qualities as good as the mono pigment coatings...|$|R
40|$|The rising {{concern about}} the impact of {{printing}} material on the environment is pushing the graphic industry to turn towards the use of materials derived from abundant, renewable resources. The end-result of this process would be a replacement of conventional printing materials that are often derived from unsustainable resources. The aim of this study was the application of cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) coating as a novel type of sustainable coating that might eliminate use of synthetic coatings. The selected coating was prepared from cellulose nanocrystals suspension that was derived from cellulose fibrils on the laboratory scale. The coating formulation examined in this paper was not yet used on the industrial scale. Experimental research was carried out in the form of preliminary laboratory tests for offset printing application using IGT test methods of ink transfer and set-off. Paper coated with cellulose nanocrystals was used as a printing substrate, while vegetable oil-based ink was used as a printing ink in order to stay in line with environmentally preferred choice of printing materials. The results indicated an increase in surface <b>gloss</b> on paper <b>coated</b> with cellulose nanocrystals, as well as in print gloss on printed paper coated with cellulose nanocrystals.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{designed}} to identify constraints and potential solutions for improved performance and quality of digitally printed papers. The targeted market segment is high-end digital production in the U. S. In the first phase a survey of print providers has been conducted, the sample drawn from the network of printing companies currently engaged with Printing Industry Center (CIAS) research activities. The second phase will be to follow up observations from the survey with a case study approach, working with both print providers and with digital press manufacturers. In {{order to understand the}} characteristics of this digital printing market segment, a demographic study of the respondent group was conducted as part of the survey. This was followed by an exploration of the considerations and paper characteristics that are involved in the paper grade selection decision. The role that paper characteristics and press requirements play in production efficiency and document quality was investigated. The change in paper costs to printers {{over the last few years}} was also explored. Specific research objectives included: identifying the paper grades commonly used for the market segment of production digital printing, identifying the number of brands used and the nature of printing companies’ relationships to suppliers, determining the factors that affect brand and purchase decisions, discovering the relative importance of different paper properties and characteristics, assessing the deficiencies in currently-available paper grades, and determining what improvements are required by digital printers, and what limitations are currently imposed by press design. The leading digital paper grades used in digital printing production were found to be <b>coated</b> <b>gloss,</b> premium uncoated, uncoated calendered, coated matte, uncoated uncalendered, and premium bond. The median number of paper brands used by this sample is five, with a wide range indicating varied practices. When making the paper purchase decision, almost half the time print providers and print purchasers collaborate on the selection of paper grades. Leading factors involved in the paper purchase decision were identified as runnability and print quality, followed in importance by availability of grade, appearance properties, price, multipurpose functionality across different technologies, and product range. The leading paper characteristics considered when making a purchase decision were found to be, in order of importance, toner/ink adhesion, accurate sheet dimensions, dimensional stability, and moisture level. Performance- and runnability-related factors were found to be more important than appearance-related factors in the purchase decision. Evans 2 ̆ 6 LeMa i re (PICRM- 2005 - 06) Overall, the price of papers charged by manufacturers to print producers seems not to be a leading factor in making the paper selection decision. Price was not a key driver in selecting brand or grade type, even though most printers have experienced paper cost increases in the last few years. The area of improvement that printers want to see most is an extended product range, with more sizes, finishes, and basis weights available for their digital presses. The presses currently owned impose paper choice limitations on size, basis weight, thickness, and surface treatment requirements. In general, it appears that there is room for product development to meet the developing potential for production digital printing applications. The survey data will be used to construct a case-study research project to further explore the observations and inferences...|$|R
