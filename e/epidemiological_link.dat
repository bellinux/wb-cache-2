Molecular genetics methods, such as DNA sequencing and DNA-DNA hybridization, {{can be useful}} for correct identification, although work by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has suggested they are unnecessary in most cases. Several groups have used 16S rDNA sequencing to identify S.iniae isolates, and while it can differentiate this species from other related species, such as S.porcinus and S.uberis, 16S sequencing cannot be used to differentiate between strains of S.iniae. [...] Ribotyping is a similar method, by which 16S and 23S rRNA genes are digested with restriction endonucleases and Southern blotted using species-specific oligonucleotide probes.

40|$|Our aim was {{to analyze}} the {{difference}} between methods for genotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex isolates. We collected genotyping results from Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) and Mycobacterial Interspersed Repetitive Units- Variable Numbers of Tandem Repeat (MIRU-VNTR) in a geographically limited area (Stockholm) {{during a period of}} three years. The number and proportion of isolates belonging to clusters was reduced by 45 and 35 % respectively when combining the two methods compared with using RFLP or MIRU-VNTR only. The mean size of the clusters was smaller when combining methods and smaller with RFLP compared to MIRU-VNTR. In clusters with confirmed <b>epidemiological</b> <b>links</b> RFLP coincided slightly better than MIRU-VNTR but where there was a difference, the variation in MIRU-VNTR pattern was only in a single locus. In isolates with few IS 6110 bands in RFLP, MIRU-VNTR differentiated the isolates more, dividing the RFLP clusters. Since MIRU-VNTR is faster and less labour-intensive it is the method of choice for routine genotyping. In most cases it will be sufficient for epidemiological purposes but true clustering might still be considered if there are <b>epidemiological</b> <b>links</b> and the MIRU-VNTR results differ in only one of its 24 loci...|$|R

40|$|Kathmandu, Nepald ABSTRACT Cholera {{continues}} to be an important cause of human infections, and outbreaks are often observed after natural disasters, such as the one following the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. Once the cholera outbreak was confirmed, rumors spread that the disease was brought to Haiti by a battalion of Nepalese soldiers serving as United Nations peacekeepers. This possible connection has never been confirmed. We used whole-genome sequence typing (WGST), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and antimicrobial susceptibility testing to characterize 24 recent Vibrio cholerae isolates from Nepal and evaluate the suggested <b>epidemiological</b> <b>link</b> with the Haitian outbreak. The isolates were obtained from 30 July to 1 November 2010 from five different districts in Nepal. We compared the 24 genomes to 10 previously sequenced V. cholerae isolates, including 3 from the Haitian outbreak (began July 2010). Antimicrobial susceptibility and PFGE patterns were consistent with an <b>epidemiological</b> <b>link</b> between the isolates from Nepal and Haiti. WGST showed that all 24 V. cholerae isolates from Nepal belonged to a single monophyletic group that also contained isolates from Bangladesh and Haiti. The Nepalese isolates were divided into four closely related clusters. One cluster contained three Nepalese isolates and three Haitian isolates that were almost identical, with only 1 - or 2 -bp differences. Results in this study are consistent with Nepal as the origin of the Haitian outbreak.

40|$|Abstract Background The role of {{hospital}} water {{systems in the}} development of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) surgical site infections (SSIs) in low-income countries is barely studied. This study characterized P. aeruginosa isolates from patients and water in order to establish possible <b>epidemiological</b> <b>links.</b> Methods Between December 2014 and September 2015, rectal and wound swabs, and water samples were collected in the frame of active surveillance for SSIs in the two Tanzanian hospitals. Typing of P. aeruginosa was done by multi-locus sequence typing. Results Of 930 enrolled patients, 536 were followed up, of whom 78 (14. 6 %, 95 % CI; 11. 6 – 17. 5) developed SSIs. P. aeruginosa was found in eight (14 %) of 57 investigated wounds. Of the 43 water sampling points, 29 were positive for P. aeruginosa. However, <b>epidemiological</b> <b>links</b> to wound infections were not confirmed. The P. aeruginosa carriage rate on admission was 0. 9 % (8 / 930). Of the 363 patients re-screened upon discharge, four (1. 1 %) possibly acquired P. aeruginosa during hospitalization. Wound infections of the three of the eight P. aeruginosa SSIs were caused by a strain of the same sequence type (ST) as the one from intestinal carriage. Isolates from patients were more resistant to antibiotics than water isolates. Conclusions The P. aeruginosa SSI rate was low. There was no evidence for transmission from tap water. Not all P. aeruginosa SSI were proven to be endogenous, pointing to other routes of transmission...|$|R

It was our objective to assess the sensitivity of different phylogenetic methods and various phylogenetic programs to reconstruct <b>epidemiological</b> <b>links</b> among HIV- 1 infected patients that is the probability to reveal a true transmission relationship. Multiple datasets (90) were prepared consisting of HIV- 1 sequences in protease (PR) and partial reverse transcriptase (RT) sampled from patients with documented epidemiological relationship (target population), and from unrelated individuals (control population) belonging to the same HIV- 1 subtype as the target population. Each dataset varied regarding the number, the geographic origin and the transmission risk groups of the sequences among the control population. Phylogenetic trees were inferred by neighbor-joining (NJ), maximum likelihood heuristics (hML) and Bayesian methods. All clusters of sequences belonging to the target population were correctly reconstructed by NJ and Bayesian methods receiving high bootstrap and posterior probability (PP) support, respectively. On the other hand, TreePuzzle failed to reconstruct or provide significant support for several clusters; high puzzling step support was associated with the inclusion of control sequences from the same geographic area as the target population. In contrary, all clusters were correctly reconstructed by hML as implemented in PhyML 3. 0 receiving high bootstrap support. We report that under the conditions of our study, hML using PhyML, NJ and Bayesian methods were the most sensitive for the reconstruction of <b>epidemiological</b> <b>links</b> mostly from sexually infected individuals. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundBetween 2000 and 2012 {{the number}} of multidrug-resistant (MDR) {{tuberculosis}} cases in the UK increased from 28 per year to 81 per year. We investigated the proportion of MDR tuberculosis cases arising from transmission in the UK and associated risk factors. MethodWe identified patients with MDR tuberculosis notified in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland between Jan 1, 2004, and Dec 31, 2007, by linking national laboratory and surveillance data. Data for laboratory isolates, including drug sensitivities and 24 -mycobacterial interspersed repetitive-unit-variable-number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR) typing were obtained routinely from the National Tuberculosis Reference laboratories as part of national tuberculosis surveillance. We investigated clusters of cases with indistinguishable MIRU-VNTR profiles to identify <b>epidemiological</b> <b>links.</b> We calculated transmission using the n– 1 method and established associated risk factors by logistic regression. We also assessed the likelihood of transmission to additional secondary active tuberculosis cases, identified through conventional contact tracing. Findings 204 patients were diagnosed with MDR tuberculosis in the study period; 189 (92 · 6 %) had an MIRU-VNTR profile. We identified 12 clusters containing 40 individuals and 149 unique strains. The proportion of cases attributable to recent transmission, {{on the basis of}} molecular data, was 15 % (40 cases clustered– 12 clusters/ 189 with a strain type). The proportion of cases attributable to recent transmission (ie, transmission within the UK) after adjustment for <b>epidemiological</b> <b>links</b> was 8 · 5 % (22 cases with epidemiological links–six clusters/ 189 cases with a strain type). Being UK born (odds ratio 4 · 81; 95 % CI 2 · 03 – 11 · 36, p= 0 · 0005) and illicit drug use (4 · 75; 1 · 19 – 18 · 96, p= 0 · 026) were significantly associated with clustering. The most common transmission setting was the household but 21 of 22 of <b>epidemiological</b> <b>links</b> were missed by conventional contact tracing. 13 secondary active tuberculosis cases identified by conventional contact tracing were mostly contacts of patients with MDR tuberculosis from countries of high tuberculosis burden. 11 (85 %) of 13 shared the same country of birth as the index case, of whom ten did not share a strain type or drug resistance pattern. InterpretationTransmission of MDR tuberculosis in the UK is low and associated with being UK born or illicit drug use. MIRU-VNTR typing with cluster investigation was more successful at identifying transmission events than conventional contact tracing. Individuals with tuberculosis who have had contact with a known MDR tuberculosis source case from a country of high tuberculosis burden should have drug-sensitivity testing on isolates to ensure appropriate treatment is given.
