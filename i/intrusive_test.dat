40|$|Otitis Media with Effusion (OME), {{commonly}} referred to as glue ear, {{is one of the most}} common illnesses of early childhood. It is difficult to detect as OME is frequently symptom free and usually clears spontaneously. It can be detected by tympanometry, a simple painless non <b>intrusive</b> <b>test,</b> which can be easily performed by trained operators. In New Zealand all children have this hearing test on school entry. Research has shown links between OME and educational under achievement, possibly due to the intermittent deafness which accompanies this condition. As OME mostly occurs during early childhood, a time when the basis of language is being established, it may cause delays in learning which will not be seen until later in life. This research was designed to examine the possible effect of OME on emerging literacy in 120 children from a large urban area of New Zealand. The aural history of the children was established from a questionnaire and the results of the hearing tests on school entry. Measures of their reading ability were obtained from their scores on the Diagnostic Reading Survey. This survey, usually referred to as the six year old net test, is taken by most children in New Zealand. The childrens' scores on the reading test were examined to see if there was any correlation between these and evidence of OME. Although no conclusive proof was found that children with OME were reading at a lower age than their peers, statistically significant differences were found between the scores of the Dictation section of the test. The Dictation section is designed to measure how well children are distinguishing and recording individual sounds in words. The findings suggest that OME affects auditory discrimination so that incorrect symbols are ascribed to sounds. This effect will hinder a child when learning to read and may cause delays in other aspects of learning. No evidence of increased incidence of OME amongst Maori or Pacific Island students was found, however, the number of these students in the sample was very small. Maori and Pacific Island students however did have significantly lower scores than their peers in all aspects of the reading test...|$|E

Most known methods of measurements involve <b>intrusive</b> <b>testing</b> to determine the magnitude and profile of the residual stresses in the pipe wall thickness. The Photoelastic Coating Technique (Photostress Method TM) described in this paper involves capturing the locked in stresses with minimal interference and local disturbance as the residual stress is released. The existing methods used <b>intrusive</b> <b>testing</b> to determine the residual stress profile whereas the test recommended to WIS 43203 gives a single residual stress value at the bore. The Photostress Method permits stress measurements to be made directly at different points in the pipe wall and a welldefined residual stress profile was consequently obtained.

40|$|This report {{contains}} the experimental, theoretical and numerical studies performed under Department of Energy (DOE) Agreement Number DE-FG 07 - 96 ER 14732 entitled ''Surface Nuclear Magnetic Resonance for Imaging Subsurface Water. '' DOE and Department of Defense (DOD) complexes and test ranges are situated in widely varying climatic conditions {{from the desert}} southwest to the humid east. The mission of the Office of Environmental Restoration and Waste Management (EM) is {{to clean up the}} inventory of inactive DOE sites and facilities, and the goal of the EM Office of Technology Development (OTD) is to deliver technologies to make environmental restoration more efficient and cost effective. In the western United States, where a number of DOE facilities are located, the water table can occur several hundred feet below the surface. The zone between surface and water table is called the vadose zone or unsaturated zone. A characteristic of that zone is that mobility of water and contaminants is greatly reduced compared to rate of movement in the saturated zone. A thick vadose zone lowers the risk and, at least, increases the time before contaminants enter drinking water supplies. The assessment of risk is often performed by modeling of ground water flow and contaminant migration by analytical methods or unsaturated flow models (e. g. Hendrickx et al 1991). Necessary inputs for these models are the hydraulic properties of the different geological formations (e. g. Hendrickx 1990) and the water content distribution in the vadose zone (Freeze and Cherry 1979). Accurate risk assessments for ground water contamination cannot be conducted without actual measurements of the water content distribution in the vadose zone. To date, very few techniques have been developed to provide such information at an acceptable speed and cost. Because soil water contents exhibit a large spatial and temporal variability, the costs of conventional measurement techniques, such as gravimetric sampling, gypsum blocks, and neutron probes, are high. Only non-intrusive tests with a cost factor much lower than that of an <b>intrusive</b> <b>test</b> will offer acceptable alternatives. Therefore, a definite need exists for a non-intrusive water content measurement method. The surface nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique applied to imaging of ground water was first developed by Russian scientists from the Institute of Chemical and Combustion in Novosibirsk, Russia. Over the last two decades they have published a series of papers and reports describing the theory of the method, along with experimental measurements from the surface to a depth of about 100 m. Preliminary evaluation of the concepts and results merited further investigations, particularly because of the critical technical need for cost-effective water content measurements in environmental restoration...|$|E
40|$|For decades until now, {{manufacturers}} and end users alike have been {{absorbed by the}} challenge of extending {{the life span of}} power transformers. The life span of power transformers averages between 50 to 70 years, as the high capital cost of its replacement is astronomical. It is therefore essential that the utilization of the transformer can be optimized to the fullest extent of its maximum lifespan. It is generally accepted that the reliability of power and distribution transformers decreases with the ageing of their insulation system. This ageing is mainly due to the degradation of the characteristics of the insulating materials. In determining the life consumption of the transformer, measuring the degree of polymerization of the insulating paper is the more reliable way. However, this <b>intrusive</b> <b>test</b> requires a sample of the paper which means that the transformer has to be taken out from service and that portion of the unit be destroyed in the process. Therefore this method is not suitable for the transformers in service. The operating conditions of power and distribution transformers and other oil filled electrical equipment are usually monitored by measuring dissolved gasses in the insulating oil using gas chromatography. The analysis of oil samples does not represent a significant difficulty. Most electrical equipment is provided with sampling valve and a number of physical and chemical analyses can be performed both in the field and in the laboratory to determine the oil condition. Moreover, the insulating oil is widely used in predictive maintenance because its degradation under faulty operating conditions such as thermal defects, arcing or partial discharges, will produce gases that partially dissolved by the oil and their analysis may indicate the type or severity of the fault. The deterioration of transformer insulation is primarily a function of temperature and time, but it is also influenced by other factors such as moisture and oxygen content. Therefore, most predictive maintenance techniques of the transformer are focused on the monitoring of these factors. This is quite satisfactory for the assessment of the insulation conditions of the liquid. However, the techniques adopted such as the gas-in-oil analysis cannot give an account on the condition of the paper insulation. Similar sampling technique cannot be easily implemented with cellulosic paper due to the bad accessibility from the outside of the transformer tank. Therefore, a method of assessing the condition of the paper without involving the paper sample itself is required. An in-depth oil analysis had shown the presence of 2 -fulfuraldehyde and related compounds, where these compounds are known to be specific to the degradation of cellulose and other paper constituents [1 - 3]. One such in-depth oil analysis is known as the High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). When the cellulosic insulation materials within a transformer undergo degradation, either by normal aging or by being involved with an incipient fault, among the by-products formed are carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide gases and derivatives of the aromatic compound called furan. Thus the amount of furans present in the oil might be a good indication of the cellulosic insulation condition. In this work, the degradation of Kraft transformer insulation paper is examined by means of monitoring the increase in the concentration of furan compounds as well as the increase of moisture content. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{main cause}} of {{degradation}} for reinforced concrete (RC) structures is the corrosion of the steel reinforcement.

This paper presents an accelerated corrosion test setup and AE monitoring methodology based on the historic index, H(t), for laboratory experiments on RC specimens. Accelerated corrosion is attained by increasing the capillarity suction of RC exposed to chlorides. The frequency spectrum of the AE signals before and after the initiation of corrosion is investigated to isolate the frequency components associated with corrosion. It is shown that the AE signals generated by early corrosion excite a well-defined narrow band of the frequency spectrum...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} a novel {{approach}} to non-intrusive flow velocity profilingtechnique using multi-element sensor array and wide-band signal’s processing methods. Conventional techniques for the measurements of the flow velocity profiles are usually basedon intrusive instruments (current meters, acoustic Doppler profilers, Pitot tubes, etc.) that takepunctual velocity readings. Although very efficient, these choices are limited in terms ofpractical cases of applications especially when non-intrusive measurements techniques arerequired and/or a spatial accuracy of the velocity profiling is required This is due to factorsrelated to hydraulic machinery down time, the often long time duration needed to explore theentire section area, the frequent cumbersome number of devices {{that needs to be}} handledsimultaneously, or the impossibility to perform <b>intrusive</b> <b>tests.</b> In the case of non-intrusive flowprofiling methods based on acoustic techniques, previous methods concentrated on using alarge number of acoustic transducers placed around the measured section. Although feasible,this approach presents several major drawbacks such as a complicated signal timing,transmission, acquisition and recording system, resulting in a relative high cost of operation. Inaddition, because of the geometrical constraints, a desired number of sensors may not beinstalled. Recent results in acoustic flow metering based on wide band signals and adaptivebeamforming proved {{that it is possible to}} achieve flow velocity profiles using less acoustictransducers. In a normal acoustic time of flight path the transducers are both emitters andreceivers, sequentially changing their roles. In the new configuration, proposed in this paper, two new receivers are added on each side. Since the beam angles of each acoustic transducerare wide enough the newly added transducers can receive the transmitted signals and additionaltime of flight estimation can be done. Thus, several flow velocities are possible to becomputed. Analytically defined emitted wide band signals makes possible the identification ofsignals coming from each transducer. Using the adaptive beam-forming algorithm thereceiving transducers can record different signals from the receiver, equivalent to differentpropagation paths. Therefore, different measurements of time of flight are possible, leading toadditional flow velocity measurements. Results carried out in an experiment facility belongingto ICPE-CA, Bucharest - Romania allowed to the validation of the flow velocities computedusing this new technique, in symmetric, asymmetric and uneven flow conditions. The acousticderived values were referenced with those provided from a Pitot tube probe installed in the testchannel and the results obtained by the method proposed in this paper are relatively close tothis reference...|$|R
40|$|Obstructive {{sleep apnea}} (OSA) {{is the most}} common type of sleep apnea and the most {{prevalent}} sleep disorder in general. Approximately 22 million people in the United States and more than 100 million people worldwide are affected by this serious disorder. The disorder is characterized by repeated involuntary breathing cessations (apnea) or reductions in breathing (hypopnea) during sleep, accompanied by oxygen desaturation (hypoxia). The apneas occur due to the obstruction of the upper airway as a result of the relaxing of throat tissue. The hypoxia triggers a brain activity arousal to restore the normal breathing pattern until the next apneic episode occurs. OSA patients can experience hundreds of apneas per night. The frequent sleep disruptions and the resulting fragmented sleep pattern can have serious physical and psychological consequences and can lead to premature death. 	Because the apnea episodes rarely trigger a full awakening, patients are often unaware of having difficulty breathing at night. As a result of this unawareness, OSA is severely underdiagnosed. This problem is exacerbated by the intrusiveness of current diagnosis methods. Polysomnography [...] -the traditional gold-standard diagnosis method [...] -requires close overnight monitoring of patients' body functions, making it an uncomfortable and <b>intrusive</b> diagnostic <b>test.</b> <b>Intrusive</b> diagnosis methods discourage patients from getting tested for OSA until they experience its serious health effects. As a result, many patients remain untreated and OSA continues to be a major public health problem that places a significant burden on health care systems worldwide. In an effort to increase the level of diagnosis and treatment of the disorder, this work investigates the design and implementation of effective non-intrusive OSA diagnostic methods. We explore two kinds of detection methods: nocturnal methods that rely on diagnosing OSA by detecting apneic episodes from overnight recordings, as well as daytime methods which use features and signals that can be obtained while the subject is awake. This work involves identifying the data to be collected, building the appropriate systems to obtain them, and using machine learning techniques to analyze them. The effectiveness of our methods was proven using real data from clinical trials. Daytime methods quickly revealed their advantages over the common nocturnal methods and the few existing daytime methods. Experimental results show that our daytime methods perform the initial diagnosis of OSA non-intrusively without significantly affecting the diagnosis accuracy compared to the current state-of-the-art nocturnal methods...|$|R

The study also tested two theories that may account for beneficial effects of written emotional disclosure, the cognitive processing hypothesis and the social interaction hypothesis. Methods: patients and their partners (N?=? 102 couples) were randomised to write at home for 15 ?min a day over 3 ?days about the patient's diagnosis and treatment using the GDP or what the patient did the previous day (control).

Since the resistivities of earth materials are sensitive to the presence of contaminants and their break-down products, 4 -dimensional resistivity imaging can act as a surrogate monitoring technology for tracking and visualising changes in contaminant concentrations at much higher spatial and temporal resolution than manual <b>intrusive</b> investigations.

40|$|PCR {{to aid in}} the {{diagnosis}} of invasive aspergillosis has been in use for over 15 years but little or no agreement over methodology has limited both widespread clinical use and large scale multi-centre evaluation. Each stage of the assay needs to be evaluated, including specimen type, extraction protocol, PCR amplification and result interpretation. The technical laboratory procedures are the least complicated to assess, although may be specimen-specific and recently efforts have been made to standardise methodology when testing blood specimens. The specimen type influences all downstream applications and will limit assay performance, particularly if the specimen is combined with unsuitable extraction processes. Advances in our knowledge of the disease process and host response may elucidate the optimal specimen but this will vary with disease type and the underlying condition of the host. Indeed, the underlying status of the patient may restrict the use of PCR if <b>testing</b> <b>intrusive</b> specimens is favoured. Large scale clinical evaluations using multiple specimen types and/or the testing of animal models will allow us to define the correct specimen type(s), optimise methodology accordingly and define guidelines for confident result interpretation.

40|$|Geochemical {{studies of}} deeply buried {{intrusive}} rocks provide {{the foundation for}} evaluating the suitability of crystalline rocks as repositories for solidified HighLevel Nuclear Waste (HLW). This geochemical study examines the migration of natural and introduced radionuclides during interaction between groundwater and plutonic rock, to provide {{an understanding of the}} processes which may operate in the potential repository environment. Rock cores from the Coles Bay Granite (Tasmania), Kambalda Granodiorite (Western Australia) and the Roxby Downs Granite (South Australia) were selected for this study {{on the basis of the}} variation in mineralogy, fracture density and degree of alteration. Firstly, the behaviour ofU- and Th-decay series radionuclides in each rock was investigated as a natural analogue for some HLW elements to identify the nuclide migration pathways and significant sites of rock/radionuclide interaction. Secondly, Synroc doped with actinides and fission products was used as a source of radionuclides to evaluate the interactions between waste elements and intrusive rocks in a simulated water-saturated repository environment. This integrated approach has identified the mechanisms controlling radionuclide release, migration and retention. In the natural analogue studies, the application of fission-track micromapping has determined that primary uranium is distributed in the three intrusives as background U in the major rock-forming minerals, and as resistate U in the primary accessory phases. Two modes of redistribution of this uranium are evident; as secondary U in the secondary minerals formed during alteration, and as fracture U associated with the fracture-infilling minerals. The mechanisms for uranium retention are dominated by adsorption and ion exchange. The study of uranium-series disequilibrium has determined that significant radionuclide mobilisation has occurred in the recent past « 1. 2 Ma) as a result of groundwater interaction. Disequilibrium between 23 OTh, 234 U and 238 U in the three intrusives indicates that fractures form the dominant nuclide migration pathways and the most significant sites of rock/radionuclide interaction are the secondary and fracture-infilling minerals. Leach testing of Synroc with the three intrusives was carried out to determine the mechanisms and processes which occur during Synroc/water/granitic host rock interaction. Significant geochemical and mineralogical changes were observed in all three <b>intrusives</b> during leach <b>testing,</b> including loss of crystal structure and formation of surface reaction products. These changes are reflected in a change in the leach solution conditions and may also affect the distribution of radionuclides during leach testing. The presence of the intrusives significantly inhibited the total release of the actinides (Np, Pu and Cm) and the less soluble fission products (Zr, Ce, Nb and Ru) from Synroc, as a result of the change in solution chemistry and nuclide solubility induced by the presence of the granites. Substantial preferential uptake of all radionuclides by specific secondary and fracture infilling minerals (such as sericite, hematite, Fe- and Ti-oxides/hydroxides) in intrusives was also observed, which was controlled by rapid ion exchange, redox reactions, sorption and surface deposition of colloids and pseudocolloids. These results imply that fractures will form the main pathways for radionuclide mobilisation in the HLW disposal environment, and that the most significant sites for rock/radionuclide interaction will be the secondary and fracture-infilling minerals. Sorptive processes will dominate radionuclide retention and therefore retard migration of these elements away from the waste package into the surrounding near-field geological environment. The geochemical evolution which occurs during rock/water interaction may affect radionuclide release, migration and retention through changes in solution characteristics and sorptive capacity. These qualitative experimental observations of the chemically complex interactions which occur in the predicted repository environment may be used for quantitative predictive modelling in repository assessment...|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{depressed}} patients have difficulties to retrieve specific autobiographical memories in response to cue words (see Williams et al., 2007, for a review). Compared to controls, depressed patients tend to retrieve relatively more memories that summarize categories of events (e. g., when I go for a hike) rather than memories that refer to a single episode (e. g., when I stood on top of mount Kilimanjaro, in response to happy). This memory phenomenon is called reduced autobiographical memory specificity (rAMS) or overgeneral memory (OGM). Other research has shown that depressed individuals may experience intrusive memories (e. g., Patel et al., 2007). These are very specific, involuntary, disturbing memories. Up to now, it is unclear how this paradoxical co-occurrence of rAMS (during voluntary memory retrieval) and very specific intrusive memories (during spontaneous, involuntary memory retrieval) in depressed patients can be understood. The starting point of the current dissertation was the exploration of the role of rumination as a potential explanation for this paradox. Rumination refers to repetitively thinking about the causes, meanings, and consequences of certain feelings or cognitions. It seems a likely candidate for explaining the paradox because several studies have indicated that rumination leads to rAMS (see Sumner, 2012, for a recent review), and other {{studies have shown}} that rumination also triggers intrusive memories (e. g., Watkins, 2004). Twelve studies were conducted. A recurrent finding across several of these studies was that rumination and intrusive memories are clearly associated. Furthermore, I consistently found that rumination and intrusive memories were associated with depressive symptoms. The first three chapters focus on these robust findings. In Chapter 1 and 2, three studies in non-clinical samples are presented. Chapter 3 contains a review paper. In this review paper, the concepts of rumination and intrusive memories are clarified, an overview of studies investigating rumination and intrusive memories is presented, and a theoretical account for how rumination may lead to intrusive memories is proposed. In contrast to the repeated observation that rumination and intrusive memories are associated, I failed to observe a reliable relationship between (trait-) rumination and rAMS in any of my studies (Chapter 4). I additionally aimed to examine the role of resistance to proactive interference in relation to rumination, overgeneral memories, and intrusive memories. Resistance to proactive interference refers to the executive ability to ignore interference of previously relevant but currently irrelevant cognitions (Friedman & Miyake, 2004). Research shows that impaired executive functioning is related to rAMS (see Sumner, 2012, for a recent review), and that weak resistance to proactive interference is associated with more intrusive memories of a laboratory stressor (e. g., Verwoerd, Wessel, de Jong, Nieuwenhuis, & Huntjens, 2011). These combined findings suggest that weak resistance to proactive interference may be another important player in the paradoxical co-occurrence of rAMS and intrusive memories. In Chapter 5, I present evidence that weak resistance to proactive interference is related to rAMS in students as well as in depressed patients. Weak resistance to proactive interference was, however, not related to rumination, intrusive memories, and depressive symptoms. Chapter 6 presents a study in pregnant women on the role of rumination, intrusive memories, rAMS, and weak resistance to proactive interference in predicting prospective levels of depressive symptoms. Results showed that rumination during pregnancy could reliably predict postpartum depressive symptoms. In addition, my findings suggested that experiencing intrusive memories might be a risk factor for developing depressive symptoms. Somewhat counter to predictions, rAMS during pregnancy was related to lower levels of postpartum depressive symptoms, which may suggest a protective role of rAMS. Resistance to proactive interference during pregnancy could not predict postpartum depressive symptoms, but may render women vulnerable for developing delivery-related <b>intrusive</b> memories. To <b>test</b> the causal hypothesis that rumination underlies both rAMS and intrusive memories, four experiments were conducted in which a ruminative versus non-ruminative thinking style were induced (Chapter 7). However, these experiments yielded mixed and inconclusive results. These seven chapters are preceded by a general introduction and followed by a general discussion. The general introduction contains a brief background with respect to the research questions and aims. In the general discussion, the associations between all key variables are discussed one by one in the light of their theoretical and clinical implications. status: publishe...|$|R
