In response to the backlash the organization released an updated expenses and travel policy in November 2013. In December 2013, the CEO Ian Troop was ousted by the organization's board of directors, just three months after the expense scandal came into light. He was replaced by Saad Rafi. In 2014, more expenses by the organization came under scrutiny including boxes of South American wine.|$|E
500|$|Unlike the {{original}} release, Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror has received very positive reviews from critics. AppSafari gave the game a 5 out of 5, saying: [...] "Production {{values for the}} game are sky-high, with gorgeous graphics, challenging, well-designed puzzles, and pitch-perfect voice acting. The sequel also implements the same fantastic touch interface of its predecessor." [...] AppGamer gave the game a 10 out of 10, saying: [...] "Broken Sword 2 will last you hours, having all the playability of a full-priced PC game. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of game that could convert people who wouldn't look twice at adventure games, and is easily {{one of my most}} highly recommended titles on the platform." [...] GameZone gave the game an 8 out of 10 and praised the game's controls and cut scenes, but stated that the iPad version of the game can be blurry at times. Carl Stevens of TouchGen gave the game 4 out of 5 start and stated that it should be on everybody's [...] "must play list" [...] and that the ease of, and restriction between some puzzles were the only let down in the game. Jeniffer Allen of 148Apps gave the game a 4 out of 5 start and praised it, saying: [...] "Broken Sword: The Smoking Mirror is a fantastic game. The story feels as fresh and as entertaining as it did back in the day, and the slightly improved graphics are much appreciated. Many hours of entertaining storytelling lie ahead." ...|$|E

2500|$|Various {{academic}} {{critics and}} experts of diverse kinds, including E. M.

2500|$|Despite {{the musicians}} all {{performing}} free, the promotion has drawn some {{criticism in the}} press. Adam Sherwin wrote in The Independent: [...] "With its message, that the BBC 'owns' the entire musical waterfront and licence-fee payers {{would do well to}} remember that, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of propaganda film an autocratic regime sensing that its legitimacy is crumbling might produce." [...] Writing for The Guardian, Alex Petridis observed [...] "There's clearly something a little self-aggrandising about the BBC getting a raft of stars to sing an unambiguous song of undying devotion apparently to the corporation itself. ... perhaps we should forgive them three minutes of self-congratulation, particularly when it’s raising money for charity." [...] The Daily Telegraph, however, reported that the project cost less than the 1997 version of [...] "Perfect Day" [...] which drew much of the same criticism but went on to raise over £2 million for charity.|$|E
2500|$|To Judge Rich, {{even though}} section 101 says [...] "whoever invents or discovers," [...] {{there is no}} basis for {{importing}} into the analysis any inquiry {{into the nature of}} what it is that the patent applicants purports to have invented, and whether <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of thing that can be patented as an invention. Thus, when the Flook Court says that Flook's process {{is not the kind of}} process that the patent law permits to be patented, even though it is a process in the ordinary dictionary sense of the word, Judge Rich finds the inquiry impermissible because [...] "§ 101 was never intended to be a 'standard of patentability'; the standards, or conditions as the statute calls them, are in § 102 and § 103." [...] The only legitimate question, he says, is whether the claimed subject matter is [...] "new, useful, and unobvious." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{law which}} is {{applicable}} {{to this case}} is section 101 of the Patent Act. If Flook's patent claim can meet {{the definition of a}} [...] "process" [...] under that law then it is patent-eligible (that is, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of thing that can receive a patent if it is also novel, unobvious, and the like). The Court decided that the patent claim under review was instead a claim to a [...] "principle" [...] or a [...] "law of nature" [...] and thus not patent-eligible. The Court relied on a line of cases following from the Neilson blast furnace case. The principle of that case, as explained in O’Reilly v. Morse, is that that patent-eligibility must be analyzed on the basis of it being as if the principle, algorithm, or mathematical formula were already well known (was in the prior art). Flook's process is thus ineligible for a patent [...] "because, once that algorithm is assumed to be within the prior art, the application, considered as a whole, contains no patentable invention."

Weinberg soon regretted not playing faster on [...] "Badlands", and tempos did speed up on that number and some others during the accompanying Darkness Tour.

Peirce asserted the reality of (1) absolute chance (his tychist view), (2) mechanical necessity (anancist view), and (3) that which he called the law of love (agapist view), echoing his categories Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness, respectively. He held that fortuitous variation (which he also called [...] "sporting"), mechanical necessity, and creative love are the three modes of evolution (modes called [...] "tychasm", [...] "anancasm", and [...] "agapasm") of the cosmos and its parts. He found his conception of agapasm embodied in Lamarckian evolution; the overall idea in any case is that of evolution tending toward an end or goal, and {{it could also be}} the evolution of a mind or a society; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of evolution which manifests workings of mind in some general sense.

2500|$|Huxley was {{originally}} not persuaded of [...] "development theory", as evolution was once called.

Huxley had also rejected Lamarck's theory of transmutation, on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to support it. All this scepticism was brought together in a lecture to the Royal Institution, which made Darwin anxious enough to set about an effort to change young Huxley's mind. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of thing Darwin did with his closest scientific friends, but he must have had some particular intuition about Huxley, who was from all accounts a most impressive person even as a young man.|$|R

It is certain that England had no necessary communion with the arms and tortures of the Continental tyrannies, and that she stood at the parting of the ways. England was indeed an aristocracy, but a liberal one; and the ideas growing in the middle classes were those which had already made America, and were remaking France. The fiercest Jacobins, such as Danton, were deep in the liberal literature of England. The people had no religion to fight for, as in Russia or La Vendée. The parson was no longer a priest, and had long been a small squire. Already that one great blank in our land had made snobbishness the only religion of South England; and turned rich men into a mythology.
