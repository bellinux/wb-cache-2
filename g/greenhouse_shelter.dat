50|$|The Surinam {{cockroach}} or greenhouse cockroach (Pycnoscelus surinamensis) is {{a species}} of burrowing cockroach. It is a common plant pest endemic to the Indomalayan region that has spread to tropical and into subtropical regions around the world, and in isolated populations to temperate climates where protective habitat such as <b>greenhouses</b> provide <b>shelter</b> for individuals inadvertently shipped in the soil of plants. Its populations are almost exclusively female, and it reproduces asexually, having evolved several clonal strains from its sexual progenitor P. indicus.|$|R
40|$|The {{basic premise}} {{is that there is}} truth in the adage that 'without the body it is not {{possible}} to treat'; the secondary and implied corollary is that a climate for growth can be created. (The <b>greenhouse</b> <b>shelters</b> the fragile plant: the growing medium is selected, the right fertilizer added, plus water - and the temperature is controlled. Only when the plant appears to be sturdy and well-rooted is the move to normality 'in the open' undertaken by the skilled gardener). Swallow 1985) : 'the truth is that a heavily structured intensive treatment plan may be a fundamental part of the provision of real care but the myth that it is akin to a custodial punishment is hard to dispel'. The study has illustrated that in the area of child care, local authority secure accommodation has a worthy place as an aide to treatment. But it also indicates that whilst (i) there are, for some children and young people but NOT for all, other methods of 'holding' that do not rely on physical containment; and that (ii) the population placed in Local authority secure accommodation may be factorised into A. Young people, generally boys, who are on weekly remands (treated in a manner similar to that previous appertaining for youngsters in prison remand 'Certificates of Unruly Character') or on warrants to Local Authority remand homes; generally for these I. C. U. placements are an irrelevancy; B. Young people (of either sex) charged with the gravest offences - murder, rape, and manslaughter, or attempts thereto - for these the closeness of intensive care is a support and relief. Counselling for the future, the assaugement of guilt, and providing props against suicide and total despair are in equal part; and C. Those who are placed, in accordance with the Regulations, as 'persistently absconding and in moral/physical danger or likely to damage self or others'; it would be/is easy for a local authority 'owning' secure accommodation and being less than stringent in its concern to keep exactly to the letter of the regulations to use the accommodation to support its 'open' child care provision. The study has further indicated that where a local authority or other involved group is able similarly to isolate and control young people - by high staffing combined with some sort of cordon sanitaire - similar intensive work to that done in conditions of security is possible...|$|R
40|$|Greenhouses {{are gaining}} {{popularity}} in developing countries, since damage to crops from storm, heavy rainfall or sunshine can be limited and evaporation and evapotranspiration controlled. Harmful insects {{can be kept}} out and useful ones, for biological pest control, kept in. Greenhouses for tropical regions provides technical guidelines for the design and construction of simple and low-cost structures. The manual introduces meteorology and climates around the world, and related possibilities and problems in vegetable production. It suggests designs for different constructions for different climates, using glass, plastics, fibre, timber and metal.

5000|$|In October 1848 France’s {{agricultural}} education was reformed {{through the creation}} of the Institut National Agronomique at Versailles specialising in the vegetable garden. In 1849, Auguste Hardy, agronomist, became Head Gardener of the Institute, replacing Mr Massey in the garden and beginning student education. At the end of the Republic, the Institute is abandoned because the Emperor, like his royal predecessors, preferred the garden as a simple source of provisions. However, in 1865 Hardy created a school dedicated to the development of new fruit varieties using improved techniques, more <b>greenhouses</b> and <b>sheltered</b> areas. After 1866 many organisations vied for control of the school until in 1872 Pierre Joigneaux proposed l’École Nationale d’Horticulture (ENH), which was opened in 1874. It was to be self-financing from the sale of the products of the garden maintained by fifty [...] "student-workers". Its mission was: [...] "the training of expert gardeners who are able, after two years of theoretical and practical studies, to spread and popularize good horticultural practices and principles in our departments." [...] The garden was considered ideally situated: [...] "considering all the horticultural wealth gathered at Versailles, nowhere could provide a training more complete and more varied." ...|$|R

40|$|Production in {{horticulture}} {{is always}} uncertain with many climatic hazards over normal production risks. Climatic {{conditions in the}} Netherlands were analysed. These conditions could be improved by <b>greenhouses</b> and <b>shelter</b> screens. The problems and risks were studied in apple, carrot and chrysanthemum. With apples night frost during blossoming reduced the crop once in three years by up to 70 %. Hail too may cause serious damage. The fruit-grower had a chance of a serious loss of at least 8. 8 % every year. Winter carrots in frames had 10 % change of a 50 % loss. Storing carrots in the open as 'underthatchers' (under straw in the open) was never safe and the loss may be 20 to 100 %. In open ground average day temperature and the minimum night temperature influenced the chrysanthemum crop. Excess rain may detract from the bloom quality. It was difficult to calculate or estimate possible losses in horticultural production; a grower cannot foretell weather conditions. Detailed knowledge of growth conditions was also lacking. A skilled man limits his risks. But skill is both an economic {{as well as a}} technical conception; it is possible to eliminate risks but costs can be too high. Practical horticulture seldom takes precautions against rare events which cause slight damage: such damage is considered normal. If, however, an event occurs only seldom but can cause great damage a grower should lay store for such occasions...|$|R

40|$|A pot {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} a <b>greenhouse</b> as rainout <b>shelter</b> to investigate the response of diverse durum wheat cultivars under three levels of soil moisture. Four wheat cultivars namely Om-quais, Hourani- 27, Safra Ma`an and Al-Samra were grown under three levels of soil moisture which are 50 (M 1), 65 (M 2) and 85 % (M 3) of field capacity. Results indicated that the cultivars were good drought tolerant because {{they were able to}} produce at M 1 which is 4 % below the wilting point. Cultivars didn`t differ significantly for yield and yield component, based on this similarity in response, cultivars can be alternatives to each other within the soil moisture levels. Soil moisture very significantly affected all characters, except harvest index, thus, increasing soil moisture levels from M 1 to M 2 and from M 2 to M 3 caused a great increase of 136 and 77 % for biological yield/plant, 143 and 63 % for grain yield/plant, 93 and 77 % for straw yield/plant, 93 and 43 % for number of spikes/plant, 137 and 44 % for number of kernels/plant and by 7 and 10 % for thousand kernels weight respectively.

40|$|Enormous {{quantities}} of thermal effluent are discharged annually throughout the world, primarily at electricity generating stations. This waste warm water represents a vast, untapped thermal resource. ^ There {{have been many}} suggestions {{for the use of}} this warm water. The growth of fish and biomass crops may be accelerated by raising them at optimum temperatures. <b>Greenhouses</b> and livestock <b>shelters</b> can be heated. Wastewater treatment can be improved. Soil warming, frost protection, and district heating are possibilities. ^ Some of these applications have been commercially successful, while others remain on the drawing board. In spite of the flurry of research activity in this area, few studies have considered the crucial question of choosing which technologies are suited for a particular power plant. ^ This dissertation presents a procedure for finding the optimal mix of waste heat technologies given information on the volume and temperature of the waste heat discharges, the topography of the site, climate characteristics, and cost data. Carefully selected trial configurations are simulated to obtain their Net Present Values. A response surface is then fitted to these points by regression. The optimal mix of technologies for that site is found using standard mathematical programming techniques. Detailed cost tables and process models are included in the text. ^ Numerous sensitivity analyses were conducted. The results indicate that the waste heat source should be at least 75 % reliable, and the effluent temperature should be 38 (DEGREES) C (100 (DEGREES) F) or higher. A 100 MW generating station is large enough to take advantage of economies of scale. Providing waste treatment for at least five hundred persons brings in additional revenue and supplies nutrients for biomass production. ^ The procedure described in this dissertation will enable investigators to make more thorough waste heat utilization assessments, in {{a relatively short period of}} time, at a moderate cost. ...|$|R

This is important because gamma and particle radiation constitute a serious but reducible threat to long-term survival of human beings, electronics, and other materials in space environments. Also, it is anticipated that surface structures will constitute the primary mass element of lunar or Martian launch requirements. The ability to use in-situ materials to construct these structures will provide a benefit in the reduction of up-mass that would otherwise make long-term Moon or Mars structures cost prohibitive.

One such technology, known as Contour Crafting (additive construction), is shown in Figure 1, along with a typical structure fabricated using this technology. This paper will present the results to date of these efforts, including development of novel nozzle concepts for advanced layer deposition using the Contour Crafting process. This process, conceived initially for rapid development of cementitious structures on Earth, also lends itself exceptionally well to the automated fabrication of planetary surface structures using minimally processed regolith as aggregate, and imported binder material or binders developed from in situ materials. This process has been used successfully in the fabrication of construction elements using lunar regolith simulant and Mars regolith simulant, both with various binder materials. These binder materials have resulted from extensive evaluation and include both "imported" binder materials that might be launched from Earth as well as some binder materials that can theoretically also be derived from existing regolith materials. They were chosen to 1) reduce penetrating radiation as much as possible, primarily with hydrogen-bearing polymers, 2) attempt to provide an air-tight structure, 3) sufficiently mix and adsorb to regolith grains for strength, 4) maximize tolerance to day-night thermal cycling, 5) possibly increase electrical conductivity to dissipate any accumulated static charge, and 6) ease their application on planetary surfaces (specifically, the accommodation of reduced atmosphere and lack of heat sinks). Some of these materials have been tested with respect to radiation mitigation, micrometeorite resistance, and resistance to larger, slower-traveling pieces of regolith impinging on the surface, simulating nearby launch and landing activities.
