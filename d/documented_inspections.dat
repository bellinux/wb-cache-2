40|$|Traffic {{accidents}} involving heavy trucks have {{social and economic}} effects on society. However, little {{research has focused on}} the influence of heavy truck specifications such as weight. Apportioning the maximum permissible gross weight of trucks allows trucking companies/owners to consolidate loads, and therefore reduce the vehicle-kilometres required to collect and distribute a given amount of goods/material. While drivers/managers are responsible for ensuring that trucks are loaded appropriately and in compliance with regulations, some may take chances and overload vehicles. This increases the need for formal and <b>documented</b> <b>inspections,</b> in order to reduce traffic hazards on public roads due to overweight loading. According to a New South Wales Centre for Road Safety report in 2014, crashes involving heavy trucks often result in serious road trauma outcomes. When a heavy truck is involved in a crash, the vehicle mass raises the crash forces involved and hence increases the severity of the crash. Therefore, interventions should be established to mitigate or prevent these crashes from occurring. Currently, weight checks are required for trucks and truck drivers must drive to a weighbridge for a weight check. Since this is a random process, truck drivers may take the risk of driving an over-loaded truck on some occasions. This paper reviews existing studies concerning safe system interventions in relation to truck gross weight management and a framework is presented to effectively manage truck loading weight. The result may be a reduction of injuries and fatalities involving heavy trucks...|$|E

Paper-based inspections of software artifact were carried out on an industrial code artifact seeded with forty bugs. An experimental 3 x 3 x 4 factorial design with three defect detection techniques (checklist-based, Adhoc and perspective-based) as independent variables, three dependent variables (inspection effectiveness, effort and false positives) and four teams for each defect detection methods was used for the experiment. The data obtained were subjected to tests of hypotheses using One-way ANOVA, Post-Hoc tests and Mean coefficients.

40|$|Throughout Europe {{and with}} the support of the Standing International Conference of Inspectorates (SICI), school {{inspection}} has become one of the more visible means to govern education (Lawn & Grek 2012). This education and inspection policy is mediated, brokered, translated and learned through networked activities where the global/European meet the national/local, giving national and local ‘uptake’ a variety of characteristics (Grek & Ozga 2012, Sassen 2007). In this paper we explore the local features of this ‘uptake’ as processes of policy learning in the interaction between schools and inspectors. Drawing theoretically on Jacobsson’s notion of governing as increasingly done through meditative activities (Jacobsson 2006, 2010), we suggest that school actors learn education policy in the inspection process. Based on a rich and diverse material of observations of inspection visits, interviews with teachers, head teachers and inspectors, and school <b>documents,</b> <b>inspection</b> reports and decisions, we portray how governing education is done through inspection processes in two Swedish schools. The case narratives underscore the importance of local context in these governing and learning processes...|$|R

Apart from those, there are many other document types that are valuable, too, but that do not have any se-curity features, as e. g. bills and vouchers. These may be used by fraudulent people to defraud money from e. g. a car insurance company. The wide availability of scanning and printing hardware allows even non-experts to easily forge a document. We therefore present a new aspect in the exam-ination of intrinsic document features for optical document security: the goal is to automatically detect text-lines that have been manipulated or additionally inserted in a doc-ument by inspecting their alignment (left, right or center) with respect to the other text-lines in the document. This constitutes an additional feature in the goal of developing a powerful toolbox for automatic <b>document</b> <b>inspection.</b> Us-ing the extracted text-lines, the alignment margins are ex-tracted. Statistics on the distances of the text-lines to the alignment margins are used to identify lines that might have been forged.
