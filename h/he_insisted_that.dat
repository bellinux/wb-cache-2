5|$|The warriors {{retreated to}} Prophetstown where, {{according}} to one chief's account, the warriors confronted Tenskwatawa. They accused him of deceit because of the many deaths, which his spells {{were supposed to have}} prevented. He blamed his wife for desecrating his magic medicine and offered to cast a new spell; <b>he</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the warriors launch a second attack, but they refused.|$|E
5|$|A central {{pledge of}} President Bill Clinton's {{campaign}} was {{to reform the}} welfare system, adding changes such as work requirements for recipients. However, by 1994, the Clinton Administration appeared to be more concerned with pursuing a universal health care program. Gingrich accused Clinton of stalling on welfare, and proclaimed that Congress could pass a welfare reform bill {{in as little as}} 90 days. <b>He</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the Republican Party would continue to apply political pressure to the President to approve their welfare legislation.|$|E
5|$|Before Becket {{returned}} to England, on 1 December 1170, he excommunicated Roger, {{as well as}} Gilbert Foliot the Bishop of Lincoln and Josceline de Bohon the Bishop of Salisbury. After Becket landed in England the three excommunicates went to Becket and asked for absolution, but while Becket was willing to absolve Gilbert and Josceline, <b>he</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> only the pope could absolve an archbishop. Roger persuaded the others that they should stick together, and all three went to King Henry in Normandy, to secure the king's permission for their appeals to Rome.|$|E

5|$|David Cameron criticised the Labour Government's {{criminal}} justice system {{and the absence of}} father-figures in ethnic minority cultures, which he claimed as causes in the murder of Pryce. Cameron stated that lack of strong deterrent sentences for knife crimes and the failure of police to stop prolific criminals had {{played a role in the}} killing of Pryce. <b>He</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> parental background had a key role in preventing crime and called for zero tolerance of knife crime, claiming that not enough criminals were being sent to jail.|$|E
5|$|In his Commentary on Matthew, however, Origen {{offered a}} {{different}} approach. Answering criticisms {{that there was}} no mention of this incident in any of the many non-Christian sources, <b>he</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> it was local to Palestine, and therefore would have gone unnoticed outside. To suggestions it was merely an eclipse, Origen pointed out that this was impossible and suggested other explanations, such as heavy clouds, drawing only on the accounts given in Matthew and Mark, which make no mention of the sun.|$|E
5|$|Jim avidly {{read the}} Liverpool Echo or Express, liked solving crosswords and instigated discussions about varied subjects. His {{attitude}} to life {{was based upon}} self-respect, perseverance, fairness and a strong work ethic. His political views were far from left-wing, as <b>he</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> there was nothing anyone could do about the situation the working classes were in at the time, and nothing would ever change.|$|E
50|$|Lloyd Dobyns:But {{one part}} of Deming’s program {{is not likely to}} please them. <b>He</b> <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> {{management}} causes 85% of all the problems.|$|R

5|$|Sheriff Porttens {{was outraged}} {{that the police}} fled and rounded up the {{officers}} who were missing and ordered them to protect the streetcars, but thirty-three resigned rather than follow the order. Mayor Shank supported the police mutiny and their refusal to protect the streetcars. <b>He</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the situation required Governor Ralston to take action. Without police protection, the Traction and Terminal Company shut down operations and refused to restart them until adequate protection could be provided.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{was made}} {{chairman}} of the Town Planning Committee. Under Chamberlain's direction Birmingham soon adopted {{one of the first}} town planning schemes in Britain. The start of war in 1914 prevented implementation of his plans. In 1915, Chamberlain became Lord Mayor of Birmingham. Apart from his father Joseph, five of Chamberlain's uncles had also attained the chief Birmingham civic dignity: they were Joseph's brother Richard Chamberlain, William and George Kenrick, Charles Beale, who had been four times Lord Mayor and Sir Thomas Martineau. As a Lord Mayor in wartime, Chamberlain had a huge burden of work and <b>he</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> his councillors and officials work equally hard. He halved the Lord Mayor's expense allowance and cut back on the number of civic functions expected of the incumbent.|$|E
5|$|Clark helped {{organize}} the Whig Party in Kentucky, and as a reward, he {{was chosen as the}} party's nominee for governor in 1836. He won the canvass, defeating Democrat Matthew Flournoy 38,587 to 30,491. In his first address to the legislature, he outlined an ambitious agenda of reforms, including the establishing a public school system, strengthening the office of state auditor, and combating an increase in crime. Believing that banks should be held to their responsibilities, <b>he</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the state banks not suspend specie payments. He also strongly believed in the rights of slave owners, and encouraged Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois to cooperate in returning escaped slaves.|$|E
50|$|Kaunda raised Johansson, but <b>he</b> <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> {{she is not}} his mother, {{particularly}} in light of her refusal to take a DNA test for maternity. Kaunda, a former beauty queen, <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> Banda is not his father.|$|R

5|$|In {{accordance}} with {{the terms of the}} Oslo agreement, Arafat was required to implement PLO authority in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. <b>He</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> financial support was imperative to establishing this authority and needed it to secure the acceptance of the agreements by the Palestinians living in those areas. However, Arab states of the Persian Gulf—Arafat's usual source for financial backing—still refused to provide him and the PLO with any major donations for siding with Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War. Ahmed Qurei—a key Fatah negotiator during the negotiations in Oslo—publicly announced that the PLO was bankrupt.|$|E
5|$|In {{this volume}} Kierkegaard {{examines}} {{the concept of}} 'First Love' as a pinnacle for the aestheticist, using his idiosyncratic concepts of 'closedness' (indesluttethed in Danish) and the 'demonic' (demoniske) with reference to Eugène Scribe. Scribe {{wanted to create a}} template for all playwrights to follow. <b>He</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> people go to plays to escape from reality and not for instruction. Kierkegaard is against any template in the field of literature or of Christianity. He was against systematizing anything in literature because the system brings the artist to a stop and he or she just settles down in the system.|$|E
5|$|Livingstone's {{relationship}} with Kate Allen ended in November 2001, although they remained friends. He then started a {{relationship with}} Emma Beal, together having two children, Thomas (born December 2002) and Mia (born March 2004). At a May 2002 party in Tufnell Park, Livingstone got into an argument with Beal's friend Robin Hedges, {{a reporter for the}} Evening Standard. Hedges subsequently fell off of a wall, bruised his ribs and ended up in hospital; the press claimed that Livingstone had pushed him, although <b>he</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> he did not. Liberal Democrats on the London Assembly referred the matter to the Standards Board for England, who ruled that there was no evidence for any wrongdoing on Livingstone's behalf.|$|E
5000|$|He {{issued the}} {{anthology}} Cangue of the American Empire in 1996. It demands that Japan become anti-American. Moreover, <b>he</b> <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> Japan {{should do the}} apology and compensation to Korea.|$|R

5|$|Monteux {{continued}} {{to play in the}} Concerts Colonne through {{the first decade of the}} century. In 1910 Colonne died and was succeeded as principal conductor by Gabriel Pierné. As well as leading the violas, Monteux was assistant conductor, taking charge of early rehearsals and acting as chorus master for choral works. In 1910 the orchestra was engaged to play for a Paris season given by Sergei Diaghilev's ballet company, the Ballets Russes. Monteux played under Pierné in the world premiere of Stravinsky's The Firebird. In 1911 Diaghilev engaged Nikolai Tcherepnin to conduct the premiere of Stravinsky's Petrushka. Monteux conducted the preliminary rehearsals before Tcherepnin arrived; Stravinsky was so impressed that <b>he</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> Monteux conduct the premiere.|$|E
5|$|Officers from Latona {{were first}} {{to board the}} French frigate but Emeric refused to tender his formal {{surrender}} except to an officer of Horatio because <b>he</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> Horatio had caused the entirety of Junons damage. British historians have debated this opinion: William James agreed with this assessment, but also opined that if Horatio had been alone {{it would have been}} Scott surrendering rather than the French officers, such was the damage his ship had suffered in the battle. Edward Pelham Brenton, who was a serving officer in the Caribbean at the time, gives most of the credit for the victory to Latona, in a detailed account that James later criticised for its inaccuracies.|$|E
5|$|Parsons was {{immediately}} fired from Hughes; the FBI investigated the complaint and were suspicious that Parsons was spying for the Israeli government. Parsons denied the allegations when interrogated; <b>he</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> his intentions were peaceful {{and that he}} had suffered an error of judgment in procuring the documents. Some of Parsons' scientific colleagues rallied to his defense, but the case against him worsened when the FBI investigated Rosenfeld for being linked to Soviet agents, and more accounts of his occult and sexually permissive activities at the Parsonage came to light. In October 1951 the U.S. attorney decided that because the contents of the reports did not constitute state secrets, Parsons was not guilty of espionage.|$|E

50|$|In the former, Montgomery convincingly refutes Immanuel Kant's a priori, the {{lynchpin}} of Kant's system, {{and in the}} latter, <b>he</b> <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> {{all knowledge}} (no exceptions) {{is based on the}} evidence provided by the senses.|$|R
5|$|Stephen Russell Mallory (1812 – November 9, 1873) {{served in}} the United States Senate as Senator (Democrat) from Florida from 1850 to the secession of his home state and the {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War. For much of that period, he was chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs. This was a time of rapid naval reform, and <b>he</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the ships of the United States Navy should be as capable as those of Great Britain and France, the foremost navies in the world at that time. He also wrote a bill, and guided it through Congress, that provided for compulsory retirement of officers who did not meet the standards of the profession.|$|E
5|$|Stevenson also {{advocated}} {{careful study}} of the state's finances to deal with increasing expenditures. <b>He</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> the state stop covering its short-term indebtedness using bonds. However, Stevenson was willing to tax to benefit segregation in schools, and helped create the state bureau of education in 1870. Because most blacks possessed little property of significant value, the new tax yielded little revenue to support their educational institutions. State legislators rejected his 1870 proposal to create a state bureau of immigration and statistics to spur interest in and migration to the state. He did persuade the legislators to make some improvements in the state's penal and eleemosynary institutions, including establishing a House of Reform for juvenile offenders.|$|E
5|$|The {{concession}} conferred on the grantees {{the sole}} rights to mine throughout Lobengula's country, {{as well as}} the power to defend this exclusivity by force, in return for weapons and a regular monetary stipend. Starting in early 1889, the king repeatedly tried to disavow the document on the grounds of alleged deceit by the concessionaires regarding the settled terms; <b>he</b> <b>insisted</b> <b>that</b> restrictions on the grantees' activities had been agreed orally, and apparently considered these part of the contract even though the written text had been translated and repeatedly explained to him just before he signed it. He attempted to persuade the British government to deem the concession invalid, among other things sending emissaries to meet Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle, but these efforts proved unsuccessful.|$|E
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>insists</b> <b>that,</b> {{although}} court {{life has}} worn {{him down and}} made him [...] "an over-burdened mule", he would be [...] "spurred-on in every joint" [...] if he could wear [...] "trappings" [...] at Yule.|$|R
5000|$|Prestowitz, {{a former}} Reagan Administration trade official, {{is by no}} means anti-American. <b>He</b> <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> America's {{intentions}} are usually good, and that the world likes and admires Americans when they live up to their own ideals.|$|R
50|$|Emory is {{approached}} in the sanitarium about creating new ads himself. <b>He</b> <b>insists</b> <b>that</b> his fellow mental patients also be involved and suitably rewarded for their work, transforming the sanitarium into {{a branch of}} the advertising industry.|$|R
