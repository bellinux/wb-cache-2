If the boundary conditions are appropriate (we will clarify this statement in Theorem  4.4), then the Green’s function is symmetric [18]. Observe that c_ 0 =a_ 0 ^ 2 -b_ 0 ^ 2. Also, if L=∑_i= 0 ^n (a_iφ^*+b_i [...])D^i with a_n 0 or b_n 0, then we have that c_ 2 n=(- 1)^n(a_n^ 2 -b_n^ 2). Hence, if a_n=± b_n, then c_ 2 n= 0. This shows that composing two elements of R[D,φ^*], {{we can get another}} element that has simpler terms in the sense of derivatives of lower order. This is quite difficult when computing the Green’s functions since, in this case, we could have one, many, or no solutions of our original problem [16].

Approximately 85% of all the identified blocks have been in Sweden. The stones were originally painted and combined text with ornamentation and stylized characters. They can be divided into seven different styles. Some of the first known image-makers in Sweden were, in fact, rune carvers.|$|R

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to an {{important}} problem in {{the relations between the}} Patriarchates of Moscow and Constantinople {{at the beginning of the}} 21 st century. The author provides a complex analysis of the infl uence exercised by the ecclesiastical crisis in the Ukraine on the relations between Moscow, Phanar and Kiev. Special attention is paid to the activities of non-recognized Ukrainian ecclesiastical structures and their attempts to join the Orthodox world by way of obtaining recognition on the part of the Church of Constantinople. Their frequent joint meetings held at Phanar proved fruitless; however, they <b>were</b> <b>quite</b> <b>illustrative</b> as to the double standards of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in its policies towards the ecclesiastical schisms in the Ukraine. An important role here,according to the author, was played by the Ukrainian civil authorities, although the relations between Church and state as well as the events of the internal ecclesiastical life in the Ukraine (such as the attempted dialogue between the Ukrainian Autonomous Orthodox Church and the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Patriarchate of Kiev) are left outside the framework of the present research; facts concerning these areas are cited only when they contribute to the understanding of the processes under analysis. Proceeding from the data of Russian and Ukrainian ecclesiastical periodicals, the author maintains that the problem of the religious life in the Ukraine has long ago overstepped the boundaries of a “local confl ict” and that the “Ukrainian question” plays the part of a powerful catalyst in the inter-Orthodox relations. The Patriarchate of Moscow aims at preserving its status in the Orthodox world. As for the Patriarchate of Constantinople, it keeps voicing certain claims at strengthening its position as primus inter pares among the Orthodox Patriarchates, dreams about convening a new “Ecumenical Council” and puts the Ukraine at stake in its relations with Moscow...|$|R
