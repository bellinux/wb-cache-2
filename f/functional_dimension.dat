40|$|Learning in {{biomedical}} engineering is highly interdisciplinary: {{students need to}} integrate concepts between engineering and life sciences, {{and be able to}} design and develop technologies with physiological considerations. In this study, {{biomedical engineering}} students' artifacts were analyzed in detail according to the structure-behavior-framework (SBF) framework. The SBF framework has been investigated by educational researchers and learning scientists; in particular, the behavioral and <b>functional</b> <b>dimensions</b> were proved to be related to a sophisticated level of understanding of complex systems. Existing research results also indicate that experts (or expert-like learners) show {{a deeper understanding of the}} behavioral and functional aspects of systems. In the current study, a 5 -level scale comprising structural, behavioral, and <b>functional</b> <b>dimensions</b> of integrated learning was constructed to assess student learning in a biomedical engineering project course. Our results indicate that high achievers and low achievers were different in the behavioral and <b>functional</b> <b>dimensions.</b> The results also indicate significant relationships between behavioral and <b>functional</b> <b>dimensions</b> of learning and students' final course performance. These findings align with existing results in cognitive science and learning sciences on expert-novice differences, which help connecting engineering educational inquiries to the rich body of literature and findings in human learning. © 2010 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5000|$|The {{abstract}} of {{the patent}} is as follows: [...] "A molecular crossbar latch is provided, comprising two control wires and a signal wire that crosses the two control wires at a non-zero angle to thereby form a junction with each control wire. Each junction forms a switch and the junction has a <b>functional</b> <b>dimension</b> in nanometers. The signal wire selectively {{has at least}} two different voltage states, ranging from a 0 state to a 1 state, wherein there is an asymmetry {{with respect to the}} direction of current flow from the signal wire through one junction compared to another junction such that current flowing through one junction into (out of) the signal wire can open (close) while current flowing through the other junction out of (into) the signal wire can close (open) the switch, and wherein there is a voltage threshold for switching between an open switch and a closed switch. Further, methods are provided for latching logic values onto nanowiresin a logic array, for inverting a logic value, and for restoring a voltage value of a signal in a nano-scale wire.

The remaining responses are not optimal; some may be good, while others are poor choices and worth zero points if selected.|$|R

The <b>functional</b> <b>dimension</b> of an inductive query {{is the number of}} independent recursion variables, and is an important logical property of R, related to its efficient evaluation. In this paper, we compare the expressive power of various languages: the language of iterated inductive definitions, the stratified logic programs and second-order logic. The <b>functional</b> <b>dimension</b> is an important parameter in this comparison. We prove that on the class of finite-valued graphs with a successor relation, the query SP, where SP(a, b, i) if the shortest path between a and b is of cost, i, is not monadic second-order definable, i. e. it cannot be defined by a second-order formula with existential and universal second-order quantifiers on monadic relations. We then conclude that it can neither be defined by iterated inductions with one recursion variable, nor by stratified logic programs with one recursion variable. We prove that in the general case it is undecidable to determine if an inductive query is of <b>functional</b> <b>dimension</b> 1, although it can be decidable in certain cases...|$|E

This paper proposes a framework for integrating modelling, monitoring and learning aspects associated with the <b>functional</b> <b>dimension</b> of the enterprise. This framework is based on: (1) an ontology proposed for the <b>functional</b> <b>dimension</b> of an organization; (2) the fundamental concepts: entity, role and activity, that are the base for current research work by other authors, on modelling other dimensions or concerns of an enterprise architecture. Also an example of application of the framework is presented as a proof of concept...|$|E
40|$|Background & aim: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} the relationship between stress coping styles and quality of life (QOL) among patients with breast cancer. Methods:This descriptive correlational study was conducted on 50 patients with breast cancer, selected via convenience sampling in Kerman, Iran. To collect data Stress Coping Strategy Scale (Moss and Billings, 1982) and the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C 30, version 3. 0) were used. For data analysis, Pearson’s correlation coefficient and stepwise regression analysis were conducted using SPSS version 21. Results: The results showed a significant positive relationship between problem-focused coping strategies and two dimensions of QOL including total symptoms and functional scale (P= 0. 01). In addition, emotion-focused coping strategies had a significant negative correlation with total symptoms and <b>functional</b> <b>dimension</b> of QOL (P= 0. 01). Emotion-focused coping styles predicted a higher rate of the variance in the <b>functional</b> <b>dimension</b> of QOL compared to problem-focused coping styles (34. 7 % vs. 26. 2 %). The functional scale was significantly correlated with problem-focused coping styles (P= 0. 001 and β= 0. 512), indicating the predictive value of this scale. Moreover, the <b>functional</b> <b>dimension</b> of QOL was significantly correlated with emotion-focused coping strategies (P= 0. 001 and β=- 0. 612), showing the significance of this scale as a negative predictor. Conclusion: Problem-focused coping styles had the most significant contribution to the functional scale of QOL. Thus it can be concluded that usig problem-focused coping styles can be effective for adjusting the psychological reactions of patients and coping with the disease in the breast cancer patients...|$|E

40|$|It is {{suggested}} that body image is a multidimensional construct consisting of cognitive, behavioural and affective components. However body image incorporates not only ones physical attractiveness, or the way the body “looks” (aesthetics), but also how the body functions, or what it can “do”(function). Measurements of body image should therefore incorporate both these dimensions. This research aims to pilot a measurement of body image that incorporates the cognitive, behavioural and affective components of both aesthetical and <b>functional</b> body <b>dimensions.</b> In total, 875 (367 male, 508 female) adolescents aged 12 - 17 (M= 13. 61) from 18 high schools across Western Australia were surveyed gathering information on pubertal timing, body mass index (BMI) and body image. Participants reported their values of, investment in, and satisfaction with, the aesthetical and <b>functional</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the body. All subscales {{were found to have}} adequate reliability (a>. 70) in both male and female participants. When controlling for age, pubertal timing, and BMI, female participants reported higher aesthetical values and investment, and lower aesthetical satisfaction, functional investment and functional satisfaction than male participants. No differences were found in functional values between males and females. All subscales were positively correlated in male participants. Functional values, investment, and satisfaction were positively associated in females. However, aesthetical values were positively associated with aesthetical investment and negatively correlated to aesthetical and functional body satisfaction. This research highlights the complexity of body image, suggesting that measures focusing on body aesthetics alone overlook the <b>functional</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the body, which are valued by both males and females...|$|R
