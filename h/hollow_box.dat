25|$|The {{first step}} is to {{construct}} foundations of the large columns that will support the elevated roadway of the YBITS. Above-grade column reinforcing is constructed and enclosed by formwork and concrete is poured. After curing, the formwork is then removed. The next step is to build the roadway itself. The spans were cast in place, using extensive reinforcing, with post-tensioned cable tendons. The roadways consist of <b>hollow</b> <b>box</b> structures, cast in place in sections using formwork, owing both to the complex shapes involved and the necessity of maintaining traffic flow on adjacent structures during construction.|$|E
500|$|Newgrange is {{a passage}} tomb in the Republic of Ireland dating from around 3,300 to 2,900 BC For {{a few days}} around the Winter Solstice light shines along the central {{passageway}} {{into the heart of}} the tomb. What makes this notable is not that light shines in the passageway, but that it does not do so through the main entrance. Instead it enters via a <b>hollow</b> <b>box</b> above the main doorway discovered by Michael O'Kelly. It is this roofbox which strongly indicates that the tomb was built with an astronomical aspect in mind. Clive Ruggles notes: ...|$|E
500|$|The bridge, {{which uses}} steel girders, {{reinforced}} concrete abutments and deck slabs, hardwood deck, and {{a stainless steel}} , cost between $12.1 and $14.5million. [...] It contains large sculptural plates of curvilinear stainless steel instead of more standard flat plates. The bridge's curvilinear design gives it a flowing, natural look, instead of the linear, rigid form of standard bridges. [...] Although its steel girders rest on concrete pylons {{and most of the}} bridge is solid concrete, the bridge uses a <b>hollow</b> <b>box</b> girder design to minimize weight, as the ground that supports the bridge covers underground parking garages. [...] The concrete base and box girder are flanked by a hollow stainless steel skeleton. [...] Despite its hollow structure, {{and the fact that it}} is designed as a concealed beam bridge, the footbridge is built to highway standards and can support a full capacity load of pedestrians. [...] The bridge is designed without standard handrails and uses waist-high parapets as guard rails instead.|$|E

2500|$|The theorbo is a plucked string {{instrument}} of the lute family, with an extended neck and a second pegbox. Like a lute, a theorbo has a curved-back sound box (a <b>hollow</b> <b>box)</b> with a wooden top, typically with a sound hole, and a neck extending out from the soundbox. As with the lute, the player plucks or strums the strings {{with one hand while}} [...] "fretting" [...] (pressing down) the strings with the other hand; pressing the strings in different places on the neck produces different pitches (notes), thus enabling the performer to play chords, basslines and melodies.|$|E

2500|$|At {{some point}} {{prior to the}} Second Sino-Japanese War (sources differ as to when) the Type 38 was {{extensively}} modified. The piece was trunnioned forward and equilibrators were added to compensate for muzzle heaviness. It was given a <b>hollow</b> <b>box</b> trail that allowed elevation to 43°. The new version was called the [...] "Improved Type 38". Some 400 units were produced in Japan, and it is unclear exactly how many Type 38s were upgraded to the improved version.

2500|$|The aircraft's design {{goals were}} low cost and {{simplicity}} of construction. Four design principles were employed: using {{the least expensive}} materials, using as little material as possible, keeping the design simple and utilizing as many common parts as possible. The resulting airframe is all-wood, with the major structural parts fabricated from Douglas fir. The tail and wing covering are birch. The wing and tailplane ribs are made in pairs from marine-grade fir plywood using a bandsaw. The wing spar is a <b>hollow</b> <b>box</b> for the first [...] from the root and then changes to a [...] "C-section" [...] outboard. Top surface spoilers are provided.|$|E
2500|$|The Severn Bridge {{is located}} {{close to the}} former Aust Ferry. The bridge is a {{suspension}} bridge of conventional design, with the deck supported by two main cables slung between two steel towers. In 1966 the cables supporting the bridge deck were spun from [...] of wire. The main cables are each made up of 8,322 individual [...] wires. An unusual feature of the suspension cables carrying the deck {{is that they are}} not vertical, as for most suspension bridges, but rather arranged in a zig-zag fashion, with adjacent mounts closely spaced. The triangulation this offers is an attempt to reduce vibration, as is the prominent use of Stockbridge dampers on the cables. The bridge is [...] long, consisting of a [...] central span between the towers and the two [...] side spans. The towers rise to [...] above mean high water and are of <b>hollow</b> <b>box</b> construction. The deck is an orthotropic steel box girder of aerofoil shape with cantilevered cycle tracks and footway supported from the box. The shape of the bridge was determined by the designers Freeman, Fox and Partners following wind tunnel tests for the Forth Road Bridge, after the original wind tunnel model was accidentally destroyed. The sections of the deck were built at Fairfield-Mabey in Chepstow, and each 132tonne section was then floated down the river before being hoisted into position.|$|E

60|$|Ben, however, {{had great}} {{confidence}} in his own eyesight, and was determined to search the mystery to the bottom. For this purpose, when he was again left alone, {{he got out of}} bed and examined the window-shutters. He soon perceived a small chink in one of them, through which a ray of light found its passage and rested upon the ceiling. Now, the science of optics will inform us that the pictures of the white cow and the pigs, and of other objects out of doors, came into the dark chamber through this narrow chink, and were painted over Benjamin's head. It is greatly to his credit that he discovered the scientific principle of this phenomenon, and by means of it constructed a camera-obscura, or magic-lantern, out of a <b>hollow</b> <b>box.</b> This was of great advantage to him in drawing landscapes.|$|E

6000|$|I {{had been}} {{suffering}} in my health {{a good deal}} all the way; and at last, whether I was exhausted by my complaint or poisoned in some wayside eating-house, the evening we left Laramie, I fell sick outright. That was a night which I shall not readily forget. The lamps did not go out; each made a faint shining in its own neighbourhood, and the shadows were confounded together in the long, <b>hollow</b> <b>box</b> of the car. The sleepers lay in uneasy attitudes; here two chums alongside, flat upon their backs like dead folk; there a man sprawling on the floor, with his face upon his arm; there another half seated with his head and shoulders on the bench. [...] The most passive were continually and roughly shaken by {{the movement of the}} train; others stirred, turned, or stretched out their arms like children; it was surprising how many groaned and murmured in their sleep; and as I passed to and fro, stepping across the prostrate, and caught now a snore, now a gasp, now a half-formed word, it gave me a measure of the worthlessness of rest in that unresting vehicle. Although it was chill, I was obliged to open my window, for the degradation of the air soon became intolerable to one who was awake and using the full supply of life. [...] Outside, in a glimmering night, I saw the black, amorphous hills shoot by unweariedly into our wake. They that long for morning have never longed for it more earnestly than I.|$|E

"Bless you, if I was to {{tell you}} all the thieves and burglars, and even murderers, as have been in my growler one time or another, you'd think I'd given the whole Newgate Calendar a lift, though to be sure this young chap as I spoke of {{was the only one}} as ever reg'lar set up in {{business}} there. There was one though as I reckon to be worse than all the others put together, if he was what I think him to be. It's often laid heavy on my mind that I didn't have that chap collared before it was too late, for I might have saved some mischief. It was about ten years ago--I never was a good hand for dates--that I picked up a stout-built sailor-sort of fellow, with a reddish moustache, who wanted to be taken down to the docks. After this chap as I told you of had taken such liberties with the premises I'd {{had a little bit of}} a glass slit let in in front here--the same that your little boy's flattening his nose against at this moment--so as I could prevent any such games in the future, and have an idea, whenever I wished, of what was going on inside. Well, something or another about this sailor fellow made me suspicious of him, and I took a look at what he was after. He was sitting on the seat, sir, with a big lump o' coal in his lap, and was a looking at it most attentive. Now this seemed to me rather a rum start, so I kept on watching of him, for as you'll see, my window's not a very large one, and it's easier to see through it than to be seen. Well, he pulls a spring or something, and out jumps one of the sides of this bit of coal, and then I saw it was really a <b>hollow</b> <b>box,</b> painted, you see, and made rough so as to look like the other. I couldn't make head or tail of it anyhow, and indeed I'd pretty near forgot all about it when there came news of the explosion at Bemerhaven, and people began to talk about coal torpedoes. Then I knew as in all probability I'd carried the man who managed the business, and I gave word to the police, but they never could make anything of it. You know what a coal torpedo is, don't you? Well, you see, a cove insures his ship for more than its value, and then off he goes and makes a box like a bit o'coal, and fills it chock full with dynamite, or some other cowardly stuff of the sort. He drops this box among the other coals on the quay when the vessel is filling her bunkers, and then in course of time box is shoveled on to the furnaces, when of course the whole ship is blown sky high. They say there's many a good ship gone to the bottom like that." ...|$|E

Talmudic scholars give a very precise description of the altar during the Second Temple period. The altar was built as a perfect square and was quite large: it reached a height of 10 cubits (app. 5 meters) and its width was 32 cubits (app. 16 meters). It was constructed of two main parts: the altar itself, and the ascent ramp. Both were constructed of stones and earth. On top of the altar at its four corners, there were <b>hollow</b> <b>boxes</b> which made small protrusions or [...] "horns."

During the initial step of sulfidization WO 3 center dot 1 / 3 H(2) O transforms into hexagonal WO 3 whose surface allows for the epitaxial induction of WS 2. The initially formed platelets of WS 2 exhibit a preferred orientation with respect to the nanorod surface. In the final step individual layers of WS 2 coalesce to form closed shells.
