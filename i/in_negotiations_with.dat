5|$|Insurers {{claimed that}} because {{they have access to}} and collect patient data that allow {{evaluations}} of interventions, they are essential to ACO success. Large insurers formed their own ACOs. Many hospitals merged and purchased physician practices.

5|$|Cromwell's programme, {{assisted}} by Anne Boleyn's influence over episcopal appointments, {{was not merely}} against the clergy {{and the power of}} Rome. He persuaded Henry that safety from political alliances that Rome might attempt to bring together lay <b>in</b> <b>negotiations</b> <b>with</b> the German Lutheran princes. There also seemed to be a possibility that Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, might act to avenge his rejected aunt (Queen Catherine) and enforce the Pope's excommunication. It never came to anything but it brought to England Lutheran ideas: three sacraments only—baptism, Eucharist and penance—which Henry was prepared to countenance to maintain the possibility of an alliance.|$|E
5|$|In 1600 Lew Sapieha led a Commonwealth {{mission to}} Moscow {{to propose a}} union with the Russian state, {{patterned}} after the Polish–Lithuanian Union, with the boyars granted rights comparable {{with those of the}} Commonwealth's nobility. A decision on a single monarch was to be postponed until the death of the current king or tsar. Boris Godunov, at that time also engaged <b>in</b> <b>negotiations</b> <b>with</b> Charles of Sweden, wasn't interested in that close a relationship and only a twenty-year truce was agreed upon in 1602.|$|E
5|$|In April 1997, Marvel was <b>in</b> <b>negotiations</b> <b>with</b> Mark Gordon and Gary Levinsohn {{to produce}} Captain America, and Larry Wilson and Leslie Bohem {{were set to}} write a script. In May 2000, Marvel teamed with Artisan Entertainment to help finance the film. However, a lawsuit arose between Marvel Comics and Joe Simon over the {{ownership}} of Captain America copyrights, disrupting the development process of the film. The lawsuit was eventually settled in September 2003. In 2005, Marvel received a $525 million investment from Merrill Lynch, allowing them to independently produce ten films, including Captain America. Paramount Pictures agreed to distribute the film.|$|E

5|$|In August 2011, it was {{reported}} that Nu Image/Millennium Films was <b>in</b> <b>negotiations</b> <b>with</b> an unnamed Chinese distributor. The distributor would produce the film, in exchange for a Chinese actor (Donnie Yen) being cast and filming in China. The partnership was considered to make a Chinese release of the film easier, and would have granted Millennium Films a larger share of its Chinese revenue. However, the partnership fell apart before production began. However, another Chinese studio, Le Vision Pictures, invested in the film. Lionsgate Films purchased the North American and United Kingdom distribution rights to the film for $35million.|$|E
5|$|In early 1945, the German {{war effort}} {{was on the}} verge of {{collapse}} and Himmler's relationship with Hitler had deteriorated. Himmler considered independently negotiating a peace settlement. His masseur, Felix Kersten, who had moved to Sweden, acted as an intermediary <b>in</b> <b>negotiations</b> <b>with</b> Count Folke Bernadotte, head of the Swedish Red Cross. Letters were exchanged between the two men, and direct meetings were arranged by Walter Schellenberg of the RSHA.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} famous of the early African Americans in the {{territory}} was George Bonga. He was born in Minnesota in 1802, his father Pierre Bonga the son of a freed slave and his mother a member of the Ojibwe tribe. Bonga was schooled in Montreal and eventually became a fur trader in the Northwest territories. He went on to serve as an interpreter <b>in</b> <b>negotiations</b> <b>with</b> the Ojibwe (particularly as a representative of Michigan Governor Lewis Cass). His brother Stephen served as the Ojibwe interpreter at Fort Snelling for the 1837 treaty.|$|E

5|$|The Germans reaffirmed their {{alliance}} with Italy and signed non-aggression pacts with Denmark, Estonia and Latvia whilst trade links were formalised with Romania, Norway and Sweden. Hitler's foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop arranged <b>in</b> <b>negotiations</b> <b>with</b> the Soviet Union a non-aggression pact, the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, which {{was signed in}} August 1939.

5|$|After World War II (Great Patriotic War), Molotov was {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>negotiations</b> <b>with</b> the Western allies, {{in which he}} became noted for his diplomatic skills. He retained his place as a leading Soviet diplomat and politician until March 1949, when he fell out of Stalin's favour and lost the foreign affairs ministry leadership to Andrei Vyshinsky. Molotov's relationship with Stalin deteriorated further, with Stalin criticising Molotov {{in a speech to}} the 19th Party Congress. However, after Stalin's death in 1953, Molotov was staunchly opposed to Khrushchev's de-Stalinisation policy. Molotov defended Stalin's policies and legacy until his death in 1986, and harshly criticised Stalin's successors, especially Khrushchev.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{appeared}} before the Continental Congress as early as September 1778 on behalf of Vermont, seeking recognition as an independent state. He reported that due to Vermont's expansion to include border towns from New Hampshire, Congress was reluctant to grant independent statehood to Vermont. Between 1780 and 1783 Allen participated, along with his brother Ira, Vermont Governor Thomas Chittenden, and others, <b>in</b> <b>negotiations</b> <b>with</b> Frederick Haldimand, the governor of Quebec, that were ostensibly about prisoner exchanges, but were really about establishing Vermont as a new British province and gaining military protection for its residents. The negotiations, once details of them were published, were often described by opponents of Vermont statehood as treasonous, but no such formal charges were ever laid against anyone involved.|$|E

5|$|As {{a player}} {{representative}} to the NHL Players Association since 1990, Linden was responsible for being the contact between his teammates and the NHLPA. He saw the experience {{as a chance to}} be involved in the business side of the sport. In light of this service, Linden was elected President of the NHLPA in June 1998. Consequently, Linden was actively involved <b>in</b> <b>negotiations</b> <b>with</b> Gary Bettman and the NHL on a new CBA that ended the 2004–05 lockout. This included a final meeting in January 2005 between Linden and Harley Hotchkiss, the chairman of the NHL Board of Governors, in an attempt to avoid losing the NHL season. Despite this meeting, a result was not found in time to keep the NHL from cancelling the 2004–05 season.|$|E
5|$|During the War in Defence of the Constitution in 1792, Piattoli {{found himself}} on another {{diplomatic}} mission to Dresden, where he stayed after the Commonwealth's defeat {{at the hands of}} Imperial Russia resulted in the Second Partition of Poland. In Dresden and nearby Leipzig, Piattoli was active in the circles of Polish patriotic emigres, who included Potocki and Kolłątaj. In 1793 he officially parted ways with Poniatowski, receiving a letter in which he was discharged from his service. In 1794 he was involved in the preparations for the Kościuszko Insurrection against Russian influence, and <b>in</b> <b>negotiations</b> <b>with</b> the newly republican France, in which Polish reformists proposed an alliance with France, promising to turn Poland into a second republic in Europe.

5|$|In 1918, Kheda {{was hit by}} {{floods and}} famine and the {{peasantry}} was demanding relief from taxes. Gandhi moved his headquarters to Nadiad, organising scores of supporters and fresh volunteers from the region, the most notable being Vallabhbhai Patel. Using non-co-operation as a technique, Gandhi initiated a signature campaign where peasants pledged non-payment of revenue even under the threat of confiscation of land. A social boycott of mamlatdars and talatdars (revenue officials within the district) accompanied the agitation. Gandhi worked hard to win {{public support for the}} agitation across the country. For five months, the administration refused but finally in end-May 1918, the Government gave way on important provisions and relaxed the conditions of payment of revenue tax until the famine ended. In Kheda, Vallabhbhai Patel represented the farmers <b>in</b> <b>negotiations</b> <b>with</b> the British, who suspended revenue collection and released all the prisoners.|$|E

5|$|In {{a series}} of {{meetings}} beginning on 25 April, Eichmann met with Joel Brand, a Hungarian Jew and member of the Relief and Rescue Committee (RRC). Eichmann later testified that Berlin had authorised him to allow emigration of a million Jews in exchange for 10,000 trucks equipped to handle the wintry conditions on the Eastern Front. Nothing came of the proposal, as the Western Allies refused to consider the offer. In June 1944 Eichmann was involved <b>in</b> <b>negotiations</b> <b>with</b> Rudolf Kasztner that resulted in the rescue of 1,684 people, who were sent by train to safety in Switzerland in exchange for three suitcases full of diamonds, gold, cash, and securities.|$|E
5|$|On November 30, Louisiana Tech {{was invited}} {{to play in the}} Independence Bowl but asked for more time as they were <b>in</b> <b>negotiations</b> <b>with</b> the Liberty Bowl and Heart of Dallas Bowl.

After the Independence Bowl's deadline for Louisiana Tech to accept their invitation passed, the Independence Bowl selected the MAC's Ohio (8–4) instead. On December 2, the Liberty Bowl extended their remaining bid to Iowa State (6–6) instead of Louisiana Tech (9–3). The Liberty Bowl did not respond to The Times' request for comment on the situation. Louisiana Tech did not end up playing in any bowl game despite boasting the nation's top scoring offense.|$|E
5|$|The Sauks {{were divided}} {{about whether to}} resist {{implementation}} of the disputed 1804 treaty.

Keokuk was not a chief, but as a skilled orator, he often spoke {{on behalf of the}} Sauk civil chiefs <b>in</b> <b>negotiations</b> <b>with</b> the Americans. Keokuk regarded the 1804 treaty as a fraud, but after having seen the size of American cities on the east coast in 1824, he did not think the Sauks could successfully oppose the United States.|$|E
