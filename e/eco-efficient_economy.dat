5000|$|EuroNanoForum 2009 conference, held in Prague {{within the}} frame of the Czech presidency, {{addressed}} “Nanotechnology for sustainable economy”. The focus was to grow opportunity and responsibility to leveraging nanotechnology to reduce pollution, conserve resources and, ultimately, build a [...] "clean" [...] environmentally sustainable economy as well as to address concerns for the safe and responsible the development of nanotechnology. EuroNanoForum 2011 took place in Budapest during Hungarian EU Presidency. The event explored how nanotechnology could contribute to sustainable solutions for Grand Challenges faced by European society and businesses in several areas, such as global warming, tightening supplies of energy, water and food, ageing societies, public health, pandemics and security with the overarching challenge of turning Europe into an <b>eco-efficient</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E

Sustainable Consumption and Production (SCP) goals and actions are powerful levers in accelerating the transition to an <b>eco-efficient</b> <b>economy</b> and transforming the environmental and social challenges into business and employment opportunities. The Life Cycle Management Approach (LCM) is an integrated framework of concepts, tools, techniques and procedures addressing environmental, economic, technological and social aspects of products and services able to implement SCP models. It is a relatively new approach in business planning and management improving decision making, integrating environmental and social sustainability with economic efficiency, identifying mutual opportunities among companies at different stages in the product/service life cycle. This paper focuses on how the change process is possible through the implementation of several existing tools and practices related to the LCM approach, highlighting constrains and opportunities in making Sustainable Consumption and Production a lasting reality...|$|E

By analyzing the scrap tires directly reclaimed and reused application in landscape engineerings such as Flower Pots, Swings, Patio Furniture, Landscape decoration, Climbing nets, Retaining Walls, Sculptures, Theme parks and more. It suggests old tires can be converted into something truly useful and even valuable and artistic {{and can be used}} in simple, cost-effective and environmentally-friendly way. Foreword When enjoying convenience from automobile, people are confronted with scrap tires at the same time. Scrap tires, which have strong resistance to heat, biont and mechanism, are hard to be decomposed, and can not disappear naturally even for decades. If piled in the open for too long, they not only occupy a lot of land, but also generate mosquitoes carrying disease, even cause fires sometimes, which should be the reason why people call them “black pollution ” [1]. How to make effective use of scrap tires without polluting the environment, is not only a worldwide difficulty, but also a new topic in resources recycling confronting China. According to incomplete statistics, as of 2002, an estimated 50 million scrap tires were generated in China, among which 20 million found no takers. The recycling rate is less than 60 %, far behind 90 %, the average tires recycling rate in developed country [2]. Therefore, It is imperative to make full use of scrap tires, and go on an <b>eco-efficient</b> <b>economy</b> road, to protect the ecological environment, and to promote the creation of a resource-conserving and environment-friendly society in China...|$|E

Curs acadèmic 2014 - 2015 In {{the context}} of globalisation, with {{environmental}} degradation, it becomes necessary to rethink economic development paths and economic development models. The Industrial Ecology emerges {{as an opportunity for}} change to an <b>eco-efficient</b> and sustainable <b>economy.</b> It provides environmental, social and economic benefits. Under this premise the present work tries to explain the importance of Industrial Ecology and propose its implementation in an industrial park in Valencia. We analyse some companies and their possible interrelations, by creating synergies between them. A project which involves five companies is proposed and some synergies are identified. Firstly, this work presents us with a description of all of these companies and their flow diagrams and also the possible synergies between them. We then expand upon this until finally we achieve a diagram of synergies within that particular industrial park...|$|R
