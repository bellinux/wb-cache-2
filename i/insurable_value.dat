40|$|Insurability is a {{major issue}} for risk {{managers}} in the insurance industry. Zajdenweber (1996) mentioned that business interruption is hardly <b>insurable,</b> using extreme <b>value</b> results: the right tail of the distribution should be modeled using some Pareto distribution with parameter 1, which has none finite moment. Since the expected value in tails is infinite, on a theoretical point of view, it becomes impossible to assess the price of that risk, and to hedge it using standard insurance covers. As we shall see, the use of more advanced results in extreme value theory (a wide survey will be proposed) may let us think that the assumption of very fat tails may be not relevant. For instance, we will propose a test {{to see if a}} distribution has a finite mean. We shall also discuss at the end the use of the pure premium as a criteria to assess whether a risk is or not insurable...|$|R
50|$|The {{appraiser}} has {{to think}} about the way that most buyers usually buy a given type of property. What appraisal method do most buyers use for the type of property being valued? This generally guides the appraiser's thinking on the best valuation method, in conjunction with the available data. For instance, appraisals of properties that are typically purchased by investors (e.g., skyscrapers, office buildings) may give greater weight to the Income Approach. Buyers interested in purchasing single family residential property would rather compare price, in this case, the Sales Comparison Approach (market analysis approach) would be more applicable. The third and final approach to value is the Cost Approach to value. The Cost Approach to value is most useful in determining <b>insurable</b> <b>value,</b> and cost to construct a new structure or building.|$|E

40|$|The Risk Management Agency (RMA) “resets ” various {{features}} of the crop insurance programs annually to reflect the market’s estimate {{of the value of}} crops intended for production in the current year. Among the most important factors are (1) projected prices, (2) volatility factors, and (3) harvest prices. Projected prices directly determine the <b>insurable</b> <b>value</b> of production, and thus impact premiums as well. The volatility factor {{is a measure of the}} price risk the market associates with potential price changes in the production year, and thus directly impacts the calculated costs of insurance. Finally, the harvest price has the potential to increase the amount of insurance coverage in effect if prices increase between the end of the projected price discovery period and the harvest price determination period. The purpose of this article is to describe the processes used to establish each of these features and to discuss important implications for crop insurance in 2013. Projected prices serve as the indemnity price/bushel for crops insured under yield, revenue, and certain group products. The idea is to provide a reasonable estimate of the expected crop price at harvest, determined at a time when many production related decisions are being made – in essence a “best guess ” of the price per bushel of the crop available to be grown. To establish the projected price for a crop in a given location, rules contained in what is referred to as the Commodity Exchange Pric...|$|E
40|$|China {{has been}} {{announced}} {{to be the}} world’s largest shipbuilder in 2010. However, I understood that, the research on builder’s risk insurance, which aims to protect the shipbuilding industry, is unfortunately quite limited. The countries, which having such important shipping interests as China, should have a well developed body of law dealing with builder’s risk insurance issues. The Institute Builder’s Risk Clauses (ILU clauses), the People’s Insurance Company of China Builder’s risk insurance clauses (PICC clauses) and the Norwegian Marine Insurance Plan of 1996 (NMIP clauses) are the main regulations governing builder’s risk insurance in UK, China and Norway. In this thesis, {{we will look at}} builder’s risk insurance under the three legal systems and make a comparison base on these clauses to find out the similarities and differences between them. This thesis is composed by six parts. An introduction of reasons and aims of this paper is showed in chapter 1. A general outlook of builder’s risk insurance on the concept, character, risks and insured interest is presented in chapter 2. The legal sources governing the builder’s risk insurance in the three countries can be found in chapter 3. A comparison in chapter 4 between these three systems is generally illustrated base on the topics about the insurance period, subject-matter insured, place of insurance and <b>insurable</b> <b>value.</b> The topic “peril covered” is specifically discussed in chapter 5 as well as the two interesting issues on the “all risks and named risks principle” and “latent defects” are addressed. The conclusion is included in chapter 6...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{problems}} related to holding commercial property as an Investment. One of the greatest risks {{is the possibility of}} total or partial loss by fire or other misfortune. The value of property destroyed each year by some form of damage is immense. The proper insurance of property is therefore of critical importance. This has been tragically illustrated by a number of recent local disasters concerning the loss of property. Insurance policies must therefore be comprehensive and ensure that any loss will be received in some form or other. There are two bases on which property may be insured, namely, Indemnity and Reinstatement. An Indemnity policy ensures that the property owner does not lose from a financial viewpoint following any damage to his property. A reinstatement policy makes provision for the repair or replacement of any damage so that the property is reconstructed in exactly the same manner after the damage has occurred as it existed beforehand. The onus for fixing a suitable value for insurance purposes falls directly on the Insured. The Insurer will calculate the insurance premium on this sum. However, when a claim is made, the insurer will calculate the 'full insurable value' of the property and this is taken as a ceiling value for insurance cover. Also, if the 'full <b>insurable</b> <b>value</b> is higher than the 'Insured value', the Pro Rata Average Clause is generally operated and only a proportion of the claim will be met. This paper explains the bases of both forms of insurance and the methods of assessing 'full insurable value'. It also explains the working of the Pro Rata Average Clause and the special provisions which ought to be incorporated in an insurance policy for property assets. Finally, the paper concludes by emphasising the responsibilities which face the professional property manager/valuer in advising the property owner in the subject area of property insurance, which is growing increasingly complicated and expensive...|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} {{of the study were}} to: (1) compare the cost-loss ratio of selected Indiana school corporations in physical property insurance coverage; (2) review the established self-insurance funds that provide protection for public school property; (3) form a hypothetical self-insurance fund {{for the protection of the}} physical property of Indiana school corporations; and (4) to determine if a program of self-insurance by means of a funded reserve was feasible as an alternative for the protection of physical property. The method of investigation included the gathering of data by means of a developed questionnaire from selected Indiana school corporations having 10, 000 students or more during the years 1969 - 70 through 1973 - 74. Evaluation was done by computing cost-loss ratios from the data. A review of operating self-insurance programs was made and a model plan of self-insurance for the public schools of Indiana was presented based on criteria of the operating funds and the experiences of the Indiana school corporations. The data were reported under the following divisions: 1. The money expended for insurance premiums for the protection of physical property. 2. The appraised value of the property insured. 3. The method used to arrive at the valuation. 4. The amount of money received from insurance companies as indemnity for loss of physical property. 5. The difficulty encountered in obtaining insurance coverage for the school property. 6. The method used for purchasing school physical property insurance. The data were treated normatively using percentages and tables. The findings of the study are as follows: 1. The ratio of claims paid to the premium costs of insurance was 15. 22 per cent for the five-year period. 2. Twenty-nine per cent of the school corporations used the insurance company engineer to appraise the value of public school property; 29 per cent used the professional appraisal company; 17 per cent made use of architects; and 13 per cent used a committee to determine the <b>insurable</b> <b>value</b> of the physical property. 3. Seventy-five per cent of the administrators reported that competitive bids were used for purchasing insurance. However, 25 per cent used other methods of placing the school property insurance. 4. Most of the administrators, 87. 50 per cent, reported having no difficulty in placing the coverage for the protection of their physical property; however, 12. 50 per cent experienced difficulty in finding a company willing to insure the property. The findings of the study support the following conclusions: 1. A considerable cash reserve would be available for educational purposes, other than the payment for insurance premiums, if the school corporations in the study had formed a selfinsurance fund during the 1969 - 70 school year and maintained the fund for the five-year period. 2. All of the state self-insurance funds are operating with sufficient reserves to meet operating expenses and pay loss claims as they occur. 3. Insurance costs for the public schools in states with operating self-insurance funds varied from no costs to 68 per cent of insurance bureau rates. 4. Economically, a self-insurance fund would be feasible for the public schools of Indiana. The findings and conclusions of the study support the following recommendations: 1. A self-insurance fund modeled after the one presented in this study should be developed and presented for consideration by the Indiana General Assembly. 2. The General Assembly should provide a reserve for the fund during the first years of operation to insure solvency. 3. The fund should operate on sound insurance principles and should be free from political pressures. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|E
