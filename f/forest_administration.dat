The castle acquired a bad reputation for injustice in the 14th century, and complaints about [...] "Lydford Law" [...] persisted for centuries. In the early 19th century, however, Dartmoor Prison was constructed, and Lydford ceased to be the centre for legal administration. The castle had fallen into ruin {{by the middle of the}} century.|$|E
500|$|Lydford {{remained}} {{the centre of}} the <b>forest</b> <b>administration</b> through the 14th and 15th centuries. Despite complaints from non-miners {{at the start of the}} 14th century that the prison regime at Lydford Castle was overly lax, by the end of the century the prison had a reputation for poor, grim conditions. The first known rhymes complaining about [...] "Lydford Law" [...] date from 1399, and continued to be popular for several centuries. In 1510, Richard Strode, a Member of Parliament campaigning for reform of the Stannary laws, was infamously arrested by Stannary officials and imprisoned in Lydford Castle. He later described how he was kept in an underground room in the keep, fed only bread and water, and encumbered with legcuffs until he paid the keeper to release him from the irons.|$|E

40|$|The main {{interest}} {{of our research}} project lies at the interface between ambiguous organizational decision-making in regional <b>forest</b> <b>administrations</b> and contradictory, complex and uncertain knowledge concerning climate change adaptation. In our case study we focus on problem-solving performances related to a) the organizational response of an administration confronted with heterogeneous expectations and interests from its dynamic environments (external perspective) and b) long-term decision-making under uncertainty on the regional and local level (inside perspective). First, along with DiMaggio & Powell (1983), we assume that regional <b>forest</b> <b>administrations</b> absorb uncertainty by adopting solutions (e. g. working tools such as risk maps) from other <b>forest</b> <b>administrations</b> whose response, {{when faced with the}} same problem, is considered as legitimate within the forestry community (institutional isomorphism). Second, we presume that practical decision-making concerning climate change adaptation measures (e. g. tree species selection) is far from rational. Based on theoretical approaches such as behavioral decision theory and Karl Weick’s sensemaking concept (Weick 1995), state <b>forest</b> <b>administrations</b> are rather understood as interpretation systems that scan, interpret, and learn while acting in mutual dependencies with their environment. Based on qualitative (32 expert interviews with senior administrators) and quantitative (national online survey among district foresters) data, we argue that – instead of being considered a hurdle for long-term planning – the acceptance of indispensable uncertainty leads to an understanding of planning as a creative process, enabling a variety of solutions. 1...|$|R
