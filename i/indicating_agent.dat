40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{methodology}} {{based on}} target-responsive structural switching is powerful in bioanalysis with the controllability and sensitivity. In this paper, an aptamer-function-alized DNA hydrogel {{was designed as}} a specifically target-responsive switchable material for protein detection. This pure DNA hydrogel was constructed by using a Y-shaped DNA and an aptamer linker through a DNA self-assembly without synthetic polymer backbone. With use of thrombin as the model analyte, the DNA hydrogel was first applied to visual detection with the entrapped Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) as <b>indicating</b> <b>agent.</b> Furthermore, the positively charged quantum dots (QDs) as the fluorophore were synthesized by using polyethyleneimine (PEI) as wrapper and characterized with spectroscopy, trans-mission electron micrograph, ζ potential, and dynamic laser scattering techniques. Along with a gel-to-sol transition {{in the presence of the}} target, the released negatively charged AuNPs from the hydrogel could approach the positively charged QDs...|$|E

40|$|Choosing actions within norm-regulated environments {{involves}} balancing achieving one’s {{goals and}} coping with any penalties for non-compliant behaviour. This choice becomes more complicated in environments {{where there is}} uncertainty. In this paper, we {{address the question of}} choosing actions in environments where there is uncertainty regarding both the outcomes of agent actions and the intensity of monitoring for norm violations. Our technique assumes no prior knowledge of probabilities over action outcomes or the likelihood of norm violations being detected by employing reinforcement learning to discover both the dynamics of the environment and the effectiveness of the enforcer. Results <b>indicate</b> <b>agents</b> become aware of greater rewards for violations when enforcement is lax, which gradually become less attractive as the enforcement is increased...|$|R

40|$|Osteoporosis {{and related}} {{fractures}} {{are a significant}} concern for the global community. As the population continues to age, morbidity and mortality from fractures due to low bone mineral density (BMD) will likely continue to increase. Efforts {{should be made to}} screen those at risk for osteoporosis, identify and address various risk factors for falls and associated fractures, ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, and institute pharmacological therapy to increase BMD when <b>indicated.</b> <b>Agents</b> which increase BMD and have been shown to decrease fractures, particularly at the hip, should be considered preferentially over those for which only BMD data are available. Drugs which have been shown to decrease the risk of age-related osteoporotic fractures include oral bisphosphonates (alendronate, ibandronate, and risedronate), intranasal calcitonin, estrogen receptor stimulators (eg, estrogen, selective estrogen receptor modulators [raloxifene]), parathyroid hormone (teriparatide), sodium fluoride, and strontium ranelate. Data are beginning to emerge supporting various combination therapies (eg, bisphosphonate plus an estrogen receptor stimulator), though more data are needed to identify combinations which are most effective and confer added fracture protection.
