Three sources of and three approaches to transaction costs are identified.

40|$|A {{model of}} tenure choice is {{presented}} which treats {{the benefits and}} costs of homeownership from a theory of finance perspective. The incremental benefits from homeownership over renting housing services are from two sources: protection against rental price risk (a <b>forward</b> <b>transaction</b> in the housing market) and from a possible capital gain from the eventual sale of a house (substitutes for portfolio investment). The cost of these benefits is higher initial outlay on housing, which reduces the funds available for portfolio investments. The comparative statics of this model is presented. It is shown that rental risk and portfolio risk add {{to the value of}} homeownership. Since homeownership is a partial substitute for portfolio investment, it is shown that the lower the covariance between portfolio returns and future home prices the more valuable is homeownership. In the presence of differential borrowing opportunities it is shown that the leverage available to housing significantly increases the value of homeownership.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} finding a model-free uper bound {{on the price of}} a forward-start straddle with payoff |FT 2 −FT 1 |. The bound depends on the prices of vanilla call and put options with maturities T 1 and T 2, but does not rely on any modelling assumptions concerning the dynamics of the underlying. The bound can be enforced by a super-replicating strategy involving puts, calls and a <b>forward</b> <b>transaction.</b> We find an upper bound, and a model which is consistent with T 1 and T 2 vanilla option prices for which the model-based price of the straddle is equal to the upper bound. This proves that the bound is best possible. For lognormal marginals we show that the upper bound is at most 30 % higher than the Black-Scholes price.

40|$|Spot {{and forward}} {{purchases}} for delivery on the usage date {{play an important}} role in matching the supply and the uncertain demand of energy, because storage capacity for energy, such as electricity, natural gas, and oil, is limited. Transaction costs tend to be larger in spot than forward energy markets near maturity. Partially procuring supply in the forward market, rather than entirely in the spot market, is thus a potentially valuable real option, which we call the forward procurement option. We investigate the optimal value and management of this real option, as well as their sensitivities to parameters of interest. We do this by formulating, analyzing, and applying to natural gas data procurement models with differential spot and <b>forward</b> <b>transaction</b> costs and correlated spot demand and nominal price random variables. Our research quantifies the value of the forward procurement option on realistic instances, also suggesting that procuring the demand forecast in the forward market is nearly optimal. This policy greatly simplifies the management of this real option without an appreciable loss of value. We provide some theoretical support for this numerical finding. Beyond energy, our research has potential relevance for the procurement of other commodities, such as metals and agricultural products. 1...|$|E

Thus, spot and forward purchases for delivery on the usage date {{play an important}} role in matching the supply and the uncertain demand of energy. Transaction costs tend to be larger in spot than forward energy, and more generally commodity, markets. Hence, partially procuring supply in the forward market, rather than entirely in the spot market, is a potentially valuable real option. We call this option the forward procurement option. The study of this option from the perspective of differential transaction costs has received little attention in the literature. We thus formulate and analyze a parsimonious procurement model with differential spot and <b>forward</b> <b>transaction</b> costs and correlated spot demand and nominal price random variables. Our analysis, in part based on natural gas data, sheds novel light on the value of the forward procurement option and its optimal exercise, as well as their sensitivities to parameters of interest. Our main insight is that procuring the demand forecast in the forward market is nearly optimal on the instances that we consider. This greatly simplifies the management of this option. We obtain analogous results with a richer model in which the supply procured in the forward market is delivered at multiple dates.

40|$|The {{existence}} of forward markets {{has long been}} explained by risk hedging behaviour. More recently, attention {{has focused on the}} Cournot competition rationale for the emergence of forward markets since the quantity of <b>forward</b> <b>transactions</b> can be used as strategic variable. However, an important facet of many forward markets that has typically been ignored in the literature is the durable nature of output (e. g. nickel and lead). We show that forward markets may optimally emerge as long as a monopolist sells any fraction of its durable output. In particular, the comparative static analysis shows that as the durability of the product increases or the fraction of output sold increases, the monopolist will optimally increase the number of forward contracts purchased due to an exacerbated commitment problem with buyers. Our analysis also provides another explanation for differences between the forward price and the expected future spot price of a commodity that does not rely on uncertainty or risk considerations.

5000|$|In {{a number}} of cases, {{including}} change of email address and mailing lists, an MTA accepts an email message that is not destined to a local mailbox but needs to be forwarded.

[...] Sending bounces to the author is administratively simpler and used to be accomplished by just keeping the original envelope sender. However, if the author address is subject to a strict SPF policy (...) and the target MTA happens to enforce it, the <b>forwarding</b> <b>transaction</b> can be rejected. As a workaround, {{it is possible to}} synthesize on the fly a temporary bounce address that will direct any bounce back to the current MTA.

40|$|Commodities, {{ranging from}} {{natural gas to}} memory chips, can be {{procured}} both by trading on the date in spot markets and in advance in <b>forward</b> markets. <b>Transaction</b> costs, such as brokerage fees, are typically higher in spot markets than in forward markets. Moreover, the forecast of a ¯rm 2 ̆ 7 s commodity requirement (demand) for a given future date typically changes in an uncertain fashion over time. Thus, although the dynamics of forward and spot prices are notoriously uncertain, firms that procure commodities face the dilemma of choosing between early and possibly less expensive commitments with residual demand uncertainty and late and possibly more expensive sourcing of the exact amount needed. We investigate this issue by developing and analyzing a model of commodity procurement for a single future date. Our model generalizes models available in the real options and operations management literature, by simultaneously considering correlated demand forecast and forward price updates in a setting characterized by multiple <b>forward</b> <b>transactions</b> and a single spot transaction.
