40|$|In {{electric}} vehicle, {{battery is}} <b>the</b> main source <b>of</b> energy for tractive power. It is technically known as “Rechargeable Electrical Energy Storage System (<b>REESS).</b> <b>The</b> durability and efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>REESS</b> is mainly {{based on its}} charging rate, discharging rate, Depth of Discharge (DOD) and operating temperature. For a given <b>REESS</b> <b>the</b> charging rate, Discharging rate at conditional temperature and DOD are the main characteristics which are constant. <b>The</b> operating temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>REESS</b> can be effectively controlled by optimized design of ventilation systems and enhanced energy efficient electric components. During charging and discharging, REESS temperature rises due to its internal resistance. Rapid charging and discharging of REESS leads to rise in its temperature beyond its safe operating limit. The maximum efficiency coupled with design intended life of REESS shall be attained when it is operated at <b>the</b> temperature <b>of</b> 100 C to 45 °C. The cell (which is the individual building block <b>of</b> <b>REESS)</b> temperature across <b>the</b> battery pack has to be maintained uniformly. Uneven cell temperatures cause improper charging and discharging and reduction in its capacity and life. The following issues are currently, 	One particular cell temperature reaches to its cut back temperature, during high speed drive. 	The overall battery pack temperature reaches its cut back temperature, after undergoing cyclic charge and discharge (drive) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle. This project is intended to 	Identify the heat source / root cause for heat source 	Assess/Calculate the heat generation rate 	Design <b>the</b> optimum size <b>of</b> conducting buses and ventilation system (mass flow rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coolant across <b>the</b> <b>REESS).</b> 	Validate <b>the</b> design by conducting set of field test...|$|R
