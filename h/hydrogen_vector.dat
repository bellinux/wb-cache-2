40|$|International audienceFor over a decade, amine-borane is {{considered}} as potential chemical <b>hydrogen</b> <b>vector</b> {{in the context}} of a search for cleaner energy sources. When catalyzed by organometallic complexes, the reaction mechanisms currently considered involve the formation of β-BH agostic intermediates. A thorough understanding of these intermediates may constitute a crucial step toward the identification of ideal catalysts. Topological approaches such as QTAIM and ELF revealed to be particularly suitable for the description of β-agostic interactions. When studying model catalysts, accurate theoretical calculations may be carried out. However, for a comparison with experimental data, calculations should also be carried out on large organo-metallic species, often including transition metals belonging to the second or the third row. In such a case, DFT methods are particularly attractive. Unfortunately, triple-ζ all electrons basis sets are not easily available for heavy transition metal elements. Thus, a subtle balance should be reached between the affordable level of calculations and the required accuracy of the electronic description of the systems.

40|$|It is {{proposed}} that an integrated ammonia-PEM fuel cell could unlock {{the potential of}} ammonia {{to act as a}} high capacity chemical <b>hydrogen</b> storage <b>vector</b> and enable renewable energy to be delivered eectively to road transport applications. Catalysts are developed for low temperature ammonia decomposition with activity from 450 K (ruthenium and cesium on graphitised carbon nanotubes). Results strongly suggest that the cesium is present on the surface and close proximity to ruthenium nanoparticles and that it produces activity in ruthenium by donation of electrons. The activity of sustainable cobalt for ammonia decomposition is shown to be a function of particle size and is more active on microporous carbon supports compared to mesoporous ones. Unlike ruthenium, activity for cobalt was not inuenced by the degree of surface graphitic nature and cobalt supported on microporous carbon approached the activity of ruthenium on the same support. In accordance with the sustainable objectives of this thesis, a case-study on the sustainability of ammonia as a sustainable <b>hydrogen</b> storage <b>vector</b> was undertaken. In this scheme, hydrogen produced from renewable electricity by electrolysis is con- verted to ammonia by the Haber-Bosch process and then converted back to deliver pure hydrogen at the point of use. The energy eciency and carbon footprint fell short of targets set by the US Department of Energy and the UK Department for Transport, the biggest impact was the production of hydrogen by electrolysis and not the Haber-Bosch process which accounts for only 9 % of total energy losses. To assess the feasibility of the ammonia-PEM fuel cell, a conceptual design was un- dertaken to quantify the palladium membrane size and catalyst quantity required for a typical road transport vehicle.

In this context, this paper presents novel insights into improving the ammonia decomposition activity of ruthenium nanoparticles supported on carbon nanotubes (CNT) by nitrogen doping. Our results can be applied to develop more active systems capable of delivering hydrogen on demand, with a view to move towards the low temperature target of less than 150 [*]°C. Herein we demonstrate that nitrogen doping of the CNT support enhances the activity of ruthenium nanoparticles for the low temperature ammonia decomposition with turnover frequency numbers at 400 [*]°C of 6200 LH 2 mol$_{Ru}$$^{- 1 }$ h$^{- 1 }$, higher than the corresponding value of unmodified CNT supports under the same conditions (4400 LH$_{ 2 }$ mol$_{Ru}$$^{- 1 }$ h$^{- 1 }$), despite presenting similar ruthenium particle sizes. However, when the nitrogen doping process is carried out with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) to enhance the dispersion of CNTs, the catalyst becomes virtually inactive despite the small ruthenium particle size, likely due to interference of CTAB, weakening the metal–support interaction. Our results demonstrate that the low temperature ammonia decomposition activity of ruthenium can be enhanced by nitrogen doping of the CNT support due to simultaneously increasing the support’s conductivity and basicity, electronically modifying the ruthenium active sites and promoting a strong metal–support interaction.

The lateral diffusion constant, Dℓ, is 2. 92 × 10 − 7 and 0. 95 × 10 − 7 cm 2 /s for 72 and 288 lipids, respectively.

This leads to a much stronger restriction on the ISMF direction and its strength. We demonstrate that {{in the presence of the}} interplanetary magnetic field the plane defined by the local interstellar medium (LISM) velocity and magnetic field vectors does not exactly coincide with the plane defined by the interstellar neutral helium and <b>hydrogen</b> velocity <b>vectors</b> in the supersonic solar wind region, which limits the accuracy of the inferred direction of the ISMF. We take into account the tilt of the LISM velocity vector with respect to the ecliptic plane and show that magnetic fields as strong as 3 μG or greater may be necessary to account for the observed asymmetry. Estimates are made of the longitudinal streaming anisotropy of energetic charged particles at the termination shock caused by the nonalignment of the interplanetary magnetic field with its surface. By investigating the behavior of interplanetary magnetic field lines that cross the Voyager 1 trajectory in the inner heliosheath, we estimate the length of the trajectory segment that is directly connected by these lines to the termination shock.

40|$|Hydrogen {{has been}} {{considered}} one of the most promising materials for energy storage during the last decade with considerable research having been undertaken to demonstrate the use of the molecule in power production systems. However, hydrogen presents drawbacks in terms of global commercialisation and deployment since its distribution is only feasible with significant dedicated infrastructure investment including liquefaction or if it is combined with other gases such as methane. The latter will still produce carbon emissions, whilst the former is not economically viable with current technologies. Therefore, an alternative is to use ammonia as a <b>hydrogen</b> storage <b>vector.</b> Ammonia, a molecule that has been used for more than a century, is a well-known material distributed across the world. Moreover, its properties allow its liquefaction at a relatively low pressure under atmospheric temperature compared to hydrogen, serving as a compound that can be used from fertilising to industrial processes. For power generation, ammonia has demonstrated to have a very slow reaction hence flame speeds, thus one option is to dope the fuel with a more reactive molecule such as hydrogen, which conveniently can be obtained from cracking ammonia. Hence, this paper presents the results of a numerical and experimental campaign where a 50 : 50 (vol%) ammonia-hydrogen blend was used for lean premixed combustion in a generic swirl combustor used in gas turbine studies. The results show that whilst the mixture can produce a good flame velocity similar to methane with the mixture having near equivalent laminar flame speed characteristics, the high diffusivity of hydrogen under these conditions leads to a narrow operational envelope with the potential for boundary layer flashback. High NOx emissions are produced due to the excess production of OH and O radicals. Recommendations for further studies and future developments are also discussed...|$|R

On the one hand, the enormous re-serves found (208 trillion cubic feet proven 1), environmental sustainability and lower overall costs point to natural gas as the primary source for energy and chemicals in the near future. 2 Nowadays the transformation of methane into useful chemicals and liquid fuels is only feasible via synthesis gas, a mixture of molecular hydrogen and carbon monoxide, that is further transformed to methanol or to hydrocarbons under moderate reaction conditions (150 - 350 °C and 10 - 100 bar). 3 For a major cost reduction {{and in order to}} valorize small natural gas sources, either more efficient "syngas to products" catalysts should be produced or the manner in which methane is initially activated should be changed, ideally by developing catalysts able to directly oxidize methane to interesting products such as methanol. On the other hand, {{from the point of view}} of CO 2 emissions, the use of the re-maining fossil resources will further contribute to global warming. In this scenario, the development of efficient routes for the transformation of CO 2 into useful chemicals and fuels would represent a considerable step forward towards sustainability. Indeed, the environmental and economic incen-tives to develop processes for the conversion of CO 2 into fuels and chemicals are great. However, for such conversions to become economically feasible, considerable research is necessary. In this lecture we will summarize our recent efforts into the design of new catalytic systems, based on MOFs and COFs, to address these challenges.

This fundamental question is addressed by sketching a sustainable energy strategy that is based predominantly on renewable energy inputs and energy efficiency, with hydrogen playing a crucial and substantial role. But this role is not an exclusive one as in the original concept of the ‘hydrogen economy’ proposed in the early 1970 s. A hierarchy of spatially-distributed hydrogen production, storage and distribution centres relying on local renewable energy sources and feedstocks would be created to avoid {{the need for an}} expensive long-distance hydrogen pipeline system. There would thus be complementary use of electricity and <b>hydrogen</b> as energy <b>vectors.</b> Importantly, bulk <b>hydrogen</b> storage would provide the strategic energy reserve to guarantee national and global energy security in a world relying increasingly on renewable energy; and longer-term seasonal storage on electricity grids relying mainly on renewables. In the transport sector, a ‘horses for courses’ approach is proposed in which hydrogen fuel cell vehicles would be used in road and rail vehicles requiring a range comparable to today's petrol and diesel vehicles, and in coastal and international shipping, while liquid hydrogen would probably have to be used in air transport. Plug-in battery electric vehicles would be reserved for shorter-trips.

To accomplish this task, in addition to researching the problem, the FORTRAN programming was learned and a FORTRAN program was constructed for the calculation of the dimensionless 2 -photon transition probability amplitude D(v) for 1 s- 2 s transition in Hydrogen as a function {{as a function of the}} incident photon frequency v in gauge vector E x vector p at certain values of v, using the pseudostate method. However, some puzzling unresolved difficulties were experienced in the calculation. Then should the pseudostate calculations prove successful for gauge vector E x vector r the method will be applied to gauge vector A x vector p. If successful, then the problem is complete...|$|R
40|$|Where does {{hydrogen}} {{fit into}} a global sustainable energy strategy for the 21 st century, as we face the enormous challenges of irreversible climate change and uncertain oil supply? This fundamental question is addressed by sketching a sustainable energy strategy that is based predominantly on renewable energy inputs and energy efficiency, with hydrogen playing a crucial and substantial role. But this role is not an exclusive one as in the original concept of the `hydrogen economy&# 039; proposed in the early 1970 s. A hierarchy of spatially-distributed hydrogen production, storage and distribution centres relying on local renewable energy sources and feedstocks would be created to avoid {{the need for an}} expensive long-distance hydrogen pipeline system. There would thus be complementary use of electricity and <b>hydrogen</b> as energy <b>vectors.</b> Importantly, bulk <b>hydrogen</b> storage would provide the strategic energy reserve to guarantee national and global energy security in a world relying increasingly on renewable energy; and longer-term seasonal storage on electricity grids relying mainly on renewables. In the transport sector, a `horses for courses&# 039; approach is proposed in which hydrogen fuel cell vehicles would be used in road and rail vehicles requiring a range comparable to today&# 039;s petrol and diesel vehicles, and in coastal and international shipping, while liquid hydrogen would probably have to be used in air transport. Plug-in battery electric vehicles would be reserved for shorter-trips. Energy-economic-environmental modelling is recommended as the next step to quantify the net benefits of the overall strategy outlined...|$|R
40|$|High Altitude Platforms (HAPs) {{represents}} an appealing solution to deliver low cost broadband access to telecommunication (TLC) networks. However, this potential can be disclosed only if a proper technology is {{identified in the}} design of airships and aircrafts. This paper first presents the innovative services which can be provided by a fleet of HAPs in the field of information and communication technology (ICT), and then a novel approach to a modular the design of HAPs is presented. In particular, this study consists of a theoretical investigation and energetic design of an HAP derived from a new class of stratospheric airship for the production of energy at high quote. In practice the energy is harvested by photovoltaic panels and stored in hydrogen fuel cells. We denote this new technology with the acronym P. S. I. C. H. E. (Photovoltaic Space Island for Conversion of <b>Hydrogen</b> as Energy <b>vector).</b> In this paper authors consider the problems connected to the dimensional scalability of the system in order to verify the possibility of producing a reduced version of P. S. I. C. H. E. for telecommunication services only. This platform for telecommunication can operate over northern Italy (about 45 latitude north) at altitudes between 15 - 16 Km. Operative altitude and volume of lifting gas can vary as a function of winds in any other location all over the world. By these considerations authors are going to propose a novel iterative design methodology to dimension an airship characterized by a shape with a vertical rotation axis...|$|R
40|$|The {{intrinsic}} factor of variability {{of renewable energy}} sources often limits their broader use. The photovoltaic solar systems can be provided with a power back up based {{on a combination of}} an electrolyser and a fuel cell stack. The integration of solar hydrogen power systems with greenhouse heating equipment can provide a possible option for powering stand-alone greenhouses. The aim of the research under development at the experimental farm of Department of Agro-Environmental Sciences of the University of Bari Aldo Moro is to investigate on the suitable solutions of a power system based on photovoltaic energy and on the use of <b>hydrogen</b> as energy <b>vector,</b> integrated with a ground source heat pump for greenhouse heating in a self sustained way. The excess energy produced by a purpose-built array of solar photovoltaic modules supplies an alkaline electrolyser; the produced hydrogen gas is stored in pressured storage tank. When the solar radiation level is insufficient to meet the heat pump power demand, the fuel cell starts converting the chemical energy stored by the hydrogen fuel into electricity. This paper reports on the description of the realised system. Furthermore the efficiency and the operational mode of the electrolyser were evaluated during a trial period characterised by mutable solar radiant energy. Anyway the electrolyser worked continuously in a transient state producing fluctuations of the hydrogen production and without ever reaching the steady-state conditions. The Faradic efficiency, evaluated by means of an empirical mathematic model, highlights that the suitable working range of the electrolyser was 1. 5 ÷ 2. 5 kW and then for hydrogen production more than 0. 21 Nm 3 h – 1...|$|R
40|$|As {{societies}} {{depart from}} current economic models which are built around affordable and easily accessible fossil fuels to energy systems increasingly {{based on the}} use of renewable energies, the need grows for a wide-scale clean and sustainable energy <b>vector.</b> <b>Hydrogen</b> fulfils most of the needed equirements, but implementation and large scale penetration, especially for mobile applications, is precluded by technical issues. Among these, arguably the most complex is how to safely, economically and efficiently store hydrogen. Storage in a porous material offers some attractive features, which include fast kinetics, reversibility and moderate energy penalties. A new methodology to analyse hydrogen adsorption isotherms in microporous materials is presented in this thesis. The methodology is applied to hydrogen adsorption in different classes of high-surface area materials but could in principle be used for any supercritical fluid adsorbed onto a microporous material. To illustrate the application of the methodology, high-pressure hydrogen adsorption isotherms of four different materials were analysed, metal-organic frameworks MIL- 101 and NOTT- 101 and carbons AX- 21 and TE 7. The analysis extracts important information on the adsorptive capacities of the materials and compares them with conventional storage methods, which include compression, liquefaction and cryogenic compression. The methodology also aids in the calculation of the thermodynamics of adsorption, providing a more accurate calculation method than currently reported techniques, demonstrated with the calculation of the differential isosteric enthalpies for metal-organic framework NOTT- 101. NMR and INS are used in a novel way at the same operating conditions of sorption experiments to validate the findings of the analysis. Both methods provide a qualitative validation for the analysis. Remarkably, the INS reveals that the adsorbed hydrogen in TE 7 is in a solid-like state. GCMC simulations were also used to compare with the application and findings of the methodology, using silicalite- 1 as a test material...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{and fuel}} cells as an {{emerging}} socio-technical system {{have been suggested}} as a very promising future energy carrier and technology to address the urgent problem of climate change and other symptoms of a global energy crisis. The flexible energy carrier {{and the emergence of}} a hydrogen based economy, according to its proponents, promises enormous benefits in terms of reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, avoiding pollution, promoting innovation, economic growth, and an increase in energy efficiency. The transformation of energy systems by unlocking economies from dependence on depleting energy resources, emancipatory uses of energy, even the transformation of entire economies and societies towards sustainability are further potential positive functions of <b>hydrogen</b> as energy <b>vector.</b> Research has left its infant stages and first applications have already been successfully demonstrated. Hydrogen has the potential to turn the energy world upside down {{but at the same time}} might also lock-in unsustainable patterns of energy supply. We are currently witnessing a phase of policy formation and strategy formulation in terms of future hydrogen economies. Hydrogen economies are a possibility but not a certainty. In the absence of consensus about the nature of hydrogen and definitions what characterizes sustainable hydrogen we investigate policy formation by a narrative analysis and a quantitative online survey of hydrogen experts in the UK and Germany - two very active and ambitious countries in terms of environmental and climate policy in general and more specifically in hydrogen R&D. Energy paradigms and story lines of major stakeholders in different discourse coalitions matter in terms of future directions. Whereas there are no 'national' storylines we can well observe country and sector-specific differences in the perceptions of hydrogen experts in Britain and Germany. These become evident in the areas of nuclear and renewable sources of energy. Hydrogen experts expect that the transition towards a hydrogen economy will be a gradual process and is not characterized by sudden disruptive changes or end-of-pipe approaches in energy policy...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{production}} from water via efficient solar based photocatalytic or photoelectrochemical processes {{could play a}} major role in the energy regimes of the future. Here, intermittent solar energy is converted into the promising energy <b>vector</b> <b>hydrogen</b> for later carbon free use on demand. Although much effort has been made in the last years photocatalytic/photoelectrochemical systems with acceptable solar-to-hydrogen-efficiency for economic operation could not be introduced, yet. Within the project DuaSol simultaneous hydrogen generation and water treatment in a photoelectrochemical tandem cell is investigated as a potentially economic process. Organic contaminants are oxidised by interaction with photo-generated electron holes at the photoanode. Produced protons approach the photocathode to react with photo-generated electrons to form hydrogen. Experiments with photocatalytic systems employing DLR’s 2 -axis tracking modified linear Fresnel solar concentrator SoCRatus (Solar Concentrator with a Rectangular Flat Focus) were carried out in order to set a reference for the further experimental assessment. Diverse photocatalysts based on titanium dioxide (TiO 2) and tin niobate (SnNb 2 O 6) were tested in a planar suspension reactor with two parallel reaction chambers irradiated in the focal plane of the SoCRatus. The evolution of hydrogen was measured and correlated to the overall solar input and to spectral quantities. Three temperature levels, mostly 25 °C, 37. 5 °C, and 50 °C, were considered and maintained during the experiments in order to study temperature related effects. Methanol as a sacrificial reagent or rather a model substance for organic contaminants formed part of the suspension with a volume fraction of 10 % at 20 °C. As expected regarding the band gaps of the considered TiO 2 based photocatalysts the hydrogen output is predominately affected by the applied UV portion. The UV fraction of solar light varies significantly in the course of a day and coherently also the production of hydrogen. Hydrogen was generated at rates as high as 7386 µmol/h. Regarding the SnNb 2 O 6 based photocatalysts the generation of hydrogen rather corresponds with the irradiance in the visible range. The solar-to-hydrogen efficiency as well as the photon efficiency in different spectral ranges could be calculated. In addition an extensive analysis of the uncertainty of experimental results was conducted. It could be confirmed that the SoCRatus is an excellent platform for the experimental assessment of photocatalytic / photoelectro-chemical systems under practical conditions...|$|R
