5|$|Adler's throat closes {{up during}} the MRI due to an {{allergic}} reaction to gadolinium, prompting two members of House's team, Dr. Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Dr. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), to perform a tracheotomy. Working in the hospital's clinic, House's first patient <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> is orange because of an over-consumption of carrots and mega-dose vitamins (niacin). House also treats a ten-year-old boy whose mother allows him to use his asthmatic inhaler only intermittently instead of daily as prescribed. House criticises the mother for making such a drastic medical decision without first learning more about asthma. During his monologue, House stumbles on an idea and leaves quickly to treat Adler; he diagnoses her with cerebral vasculitis, despite having no proof. House treats Adler with steroids, which improves her condition greatly for a time, until she starts seizing and has heart failure. The team brings her back with a defibrillator.|$|E

Mr. Milsap offers Scully a room at the local boarding house, but Scully tries the rest of the town only to be ignored by everyone; they are all too engrossed in Bible study groups. Disturbed by the turn of events, she keeps her gun close at hand. The next morning, Mr. Milsap tells Scully that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> needs help downstairs. She goes with him and finds the hitchhiker from the teaser having a seizure. She advises them {{to take him to the}} hospital, but they pretend that they do not have any cars.

After losing his leg, a replacement of sorts is fashioned. This `wooden leg´, actually carved out of whalebone, allowed him to walk with minimal difficulty.

25|$|Jeremiah Wright <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> {{less than}} a week after 9/11 gave a sermon that sadistically rejoiced how America's {{chickens}} had come home to roost... The fact is, Barack Obama opted to remain in this minister's company for more than six years after that sermon until partially distancing himself just last week in the heat of a presidential race... What the analysts who are gushing over Obama's sentiments regarding race relations are missing is not only did Obama fail to accomplish the mission he needed to, he didn't even really try. He made no attempt to explain his relationship with Wright and why he hung around a man who habitually offered such hateful rhetoric. Obama instead offered a non-sequitur on race relations.|$|E

Rosenberg said, [...] "Wilson Fisk is an opportunist, first and foremost.

He wants to get whatever he can, however he can, and see how far he can push things. He is {{in the business of}} furthering Wilson Fisk, and the new Civil War will provide him a unique opportunity. He is a Civil War profiteer." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} generally favorable reviews. Pete Johnson in the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "Dylan is a superbly eloquent {{writer of}} pop and folk songs with an unmatched ability to press complex ideas and iconoclastic philosophy into brief poetic lines and startling images." [...] The editor of Crawdaddy!, Paul Williams, reviewed Blonde on Blonde in July 1966: [...] "It is {{a cache of}} emotion, a well handled package of excellent music and better poetry, blended and meshed and ready {{to become part of}} your reality. Here <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> will speak to you, a 1960s bard with electric lyre and color slides, but a truthful man with x-ray eyes you can look through if you want. All {{you have to do is}} listen." ...|$|E
500|$|Certain {{features}} of divine images are more useful than others in determining a god's identity. The {{head of a}} given divine image is particularly significant. In a hybrid image, the head represents the original form of the being depicted, so that, as the Egyptologist Henry Fischer put it, [...] "a lion-headed goddess is a lion-goddess in human form, while a royal sphinx, conversely, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> has assumed {{the form of a}} lion." [...] Divine headdresses, which range from the same types of crowns used by human kings to large hieroglyphs worn on gods' heads, are another important indicator. In contrast, the objects held in gods' hands tend to be generic. Male deities hold was staffs, goddesses hold stalks of papyrus, and both sexes carry ankh signs, representing the Egyptian word for [...] "life", to symbolize their life-giving power.|$|E
