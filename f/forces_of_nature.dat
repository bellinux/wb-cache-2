5|$|Investigations of the {{mathematical}} structure of M-theory have spawned important theoretical results in physics and mathematics. More speculatively, M-theory {{may provide a}} framework for developing a unified theory of all of the fundamental <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> Attempts to connect M-theory to experiment typically focus on compactifying its extra dimensions to construct candidate models of our four-dimensional world, although so far none has been verified to give rise to physics as observed at, for instance, the Large Hadron Collider.|$|E
5|$|Feeling a {{sense of}} debt to Pit, Dark Pit takes him to the Rewind Spring so time can be {{reversed}} for Pit's body. On his journey there, he, Palutena, and Viridi learn that Hades has been profiting off the wars against the Underworld Army, <b>Forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature,</b> Aurum, and Chaos Kin by using the souls of slaughtered humans to add numbers to his forces. Upon arrival at the Rewind Spring, Pandora is revived due to the Spring's effects on her stolen powers within Dark Pit. Pandora then uses the Spring to restore her health and ultimately her physical body, but is still defeated by Dark Pit.|$|E

50|$|Terraformer {{was with}} the <b>Force</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> when Firebrand II was {{introduced}} as Firewall's replacement. With the <b>Force</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature,</b> Terraformer entered the war-torn Trans-Sabal to cause environmental havoc there. Project: Earth enlisted the New Warriors to enter Trans-Sabal in order to pull the <b>Force</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> out <b>of</b> Trans-Sabal. While Aqueduct killed General Halladan, Terraformer covered Nova in a deadly mold causing Firestar to hurt him badly.|$|R
5|$|The {{history of}} Highway3 dates back over 200 {{years to the}} {{pioneering}} settlement era of Upper Canada following the American Revolution and the resulting influx of United Empire Loyalists. Thomas Talbot, an influential scion who joined the British army {{at the age of}} 11, would challenge the government, the terrain, and the <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> {{to see to it that}} his road be built. Due to his family legacy, Talbot worked through the ranks quickly and found himself a personal aide to John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. He returned to England after Simcoe fell ill, but vowed to return to the hinterland he had come to love.|$|E
5|$|Andrée ignored many {{early signs}} of the dangers {{associated}} with his balloon plan. Being able to steer the balloon to some extent was essential for a safe journey, and {{there was plenty of}} evidence that the drag-rope steering technique he had invented was ineffective; yet he staked the fate of the expedition on drag ropes. Worse, the polar balloon Örnen (The Eagle) was delivered directly to Svalbard from its manufacturer in Paris without being tested; when measurements showed it to be leaking more than expected, Andrée refused to acknowledge the alarming implications. Most modern students of the expedition see Andrée's optimism, faith in the power of technology, and disregard for the <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> as the main factors in the series of events that led to his death and those of his two companions Nils Strindberg (1872–97) and Knut Frænkel (1870–97).|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Geza Affleck-Boldt (born August 15, 1972) is an American actor, director, screenwriter and producer. His accolades {{include two}} Academy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, two BAFTA Awards and two Screen Actors Guild Awards. He {{began his career}} as a child and starred in the PBS {{educational}} series The Voyage of the Mimi in 1984, before a second run in 1988. He later appeared in the independent coming-of-age comedy Dazed and Confused (1993) and various Kevin Smith films including Chasing Amy (1997) and Dogma (1999). Affleck gained wider recognition when he and childhood friend Matt Damon won the Golden Globe and Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for Good Will Hunting (1997).

50|$|However, Project: Earth later {{facilitates}} the <b>Force</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature's</b> release and retains them as agents, despite the defection of Firewall to the Folding Circle. After recruiting Firebrand II {{as a replacement}} for Firewall, Project: Earth sends the <b>Force</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> to deal with oil well fires in the war-torn nation of Trans-Sabal; when the <b>Force</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> deviates from their assignment and takes a side in Trans-Sabal's ongoing conflict, Project: Earth asks the New Warriors to pull the villains out of the country before their actions further damage the Project's reputation. The Warriors reluctantly agree and eventually succeed in the task (though not before being dragged into the conflict themselves), bringing the <b>Force</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nature</b> out for incarceration in the Vault.|$|R
5|$|One {{thousand}} {{years before the}} events in the game, on a floating continent hovering high above the surface of an unnamed planet, a technologically advanced civilization sought to harness the power of the four elemental crystals of light. They did not realize that they could not control such fundamental <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> This power of light would have consumed the world itself had the light crystals not had their natural counterparts: the four dark elemental crystals. Disturbed by the sudden interruption of the careful balance between light and dark, four warriors were granted the power of the dark crystals to recapture the power of the light crystals. These so-called Dark Warriors succeeded in their quest, and restored harmony to the world. But their victory came too late to save the doomed civilization, whose culture was reduced to ruin, though their floating continent remained. On that continent, the circle of Gulgans, a race of blind soothsayers and fortune-tellers, predicted that these events will ultimately repeat.|$|E
5|$|Strange {{travels to}} Venice and meets Flora Greysteel. They become fond {{of each other}} and Strange's friends believe he may marry again. However, after experimenting with {{dangerous}} magic that threatens his sanity to gain access to Faerie, he discovers that Arabella is alive and being held captive in Lost Hope. The gentleman with the thistle-down hair curses him with Eternal Night, an eerie darkness that engulfs him and follows him wherever he goes. Thereafter, Strange's strenuous efforts to rescue Arabella take their toll, and his letters to his friends appear crazed. At Strange's request, Flora moves with her family to Padua and secludes herself within her home, along with a mirror given to her by Strange. Drawlight is sent by Lascelles and Norrell to Venice {{to find out more about}} Strange's activities and Strange uses his magic to bring Drawlight before him. Strange instructs Drawlight to deliver messages to Norrell, Childermass and the magical community within England before dismissing him. Strange then re-invokes the old alliances that exist in England between the <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> and John Uskglass. This sparks a magical renaissance, but Norrell fails to grasp its significance.|$|E
5|$|Study {{has shown}} that the origin of charge is from certain types of {{subatomic}} particles which have the property of electric charge. Electric charge gives rise to and interacts with the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature.</b> The most familiar carriers of electrical charge are the electron and proton. Experiment has shown charge to be a conserved quantity, that is, the net charge within an isolated system will always remain constant regardless of any changes taking place within that system. Within the system, charge may be transferred between bodies, either by direct contact, or by passing along a conducting material, such as a wire. The informal term static electricity refers to the net presence (or 'imbalance') of charge on a body, usually caused when dissimilar materials are rubbed together, transferring charge from one to the other.|$|E

5|$|The demons {{attempt to}} destroy the Ray Line {{underneath}} Filgaia. It was the last resort of the Guardians to connect their remaining strength together and maintain the planet. These plans are temporarily thwarted at the last moment, with Zeikfried being thrown through a dimensional rift in space when the three confront him. Finding himself transported to the underwater wreckage of the Photosphere, Zeikfred is met by a deformed visage of Mother, who devours him. However, the remaining Demons find another way to disrupt the Ray line by creating their own tear drop designed to destroy rather than create life and using the Elw teleportation system distribute it all over Filgaia, throwing the <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> into chaos. It is also revealed {{that one of the}} Quarter Knights was not originally a demon, but Jack's lost love Elmina, which fueled his lust for vengeance.|$|E
5|$|Traveling across Filgaia, {{the heroes}} {{make their way}} to the long-abandoned Guardian Temple to gain the {{alliance}} of the mystical guardians who maintain the <b>forces</b> <b>of</b> <b>nature</b> across the planet. There they are tested individually. After each of them fails their personal tests of character, the Guardians reluctantly agree to aid them. The Guardians tell Rudy and his companions that the demons have already begun to revive their leader, and have only to lift the seal on her cocoon-like prison by destroying the three scattered statues that lie across Filgaia. Utilizing ancient Elw technology in the form of teleportation devices, the group travels the world to stop the Quarter Knights from destroying the statues, but they fail in each attempt. The consequent resurrection of Mother occurs, yet the demons are informed by their leader that it is her intention to eradicate Filgaia rather than subjugate it and tells her followers that their own deaths will follow soon after.|$|E
