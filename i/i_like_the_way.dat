500|$|In 2008, rap-filk artist Luke Ski {{recorded}} and released {{a parody of}} the Beastie Boys song [...] "No Sleep till Brooklyn" [...] called [...] "No Sleep Till Babylon", which references spoo. A stanza attributed to the Babylon 5 character Londo Mollari contains the lyrics: [...] "Spoo. All I really want is Spoo. And in the morning it's Spoo. Cause in the evening it's Spoo. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that it tastes. It's blue meatballs in greyish paste..." ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding the lyrics, Madonna had commented: [...] "I like innuendo, I like irony, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> {{things can}} be taken on {{different}} levels." [...] This statement highlighted the ambiguity of the lyrics of the song, which is hung on the word 'like'. Rooksby interpreted {{the meaning of the}} song in different ways to different people. He said that for women who were really virgins, the song encouraged them to hold their compose before they engaged in their very first sexual act. For sexually experienced girls, the song meant that {{they would be able to}} re-live the feelings of their first sexual encounter all over again. For the boys, the song presented a narcissistic image of them making the girl forget her past encounters and enjoy the sexual act as if for the first time.|$|E

5000|$|... "I {{thought the}} world of Ross Perot. I put him up there with our {{founding}} fathers. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he talked. He’d say 'We’ve got {{to clean out the}} barn!' and I agreed with everything he said." ...|$|R

500|$|A {{writer for}} Rap-Up {{considered}} the video realistic, as [...] "art imitates life". Conor Friedersdorf of The Atlantic {{called it an}} inaccurate portrayal of domestic violence due to insufficient violence, {{as evidenced by the}} lack of injuries after punching through a wall. Mariel Concepcion of Billboard suggested the video was inspired by the lyric, [...] "Just gonna stand there and watch me burn, but that's alright because <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it hurts." [...] Rihanna's appearance was criticized. Writing for Rolling Stone magazine, Daniel Kreps called it [...] "especially striking" [...] and noted her relationship with Brown. An editor from The Boston Globe commented that although the video is realistic, it hinders Rihanna's ability to set an example for women in abusive relationships. Billy Johnson Jr. from Yahoo! Music wrote that Fox's character alternated between vulnerable and confrontational personalities, while Monaghan's character is similar to Eminem. Kahn, who understood why viewers thought Eminem's and Rihanna's relationships influenced the video, asked that they realize this is untrue. He said the team had been conscious of such personal matters and Fox's and Monaghan's characters are only significant to each other.|$|E
500|$|Speculation about Dempsey's {{exit from}} Grey's Anatomy began in November, when Dempsey casually {{mentioned}} {{during an interview}} that he might be leaving the series very soon. Despite signing on for two more years {{at the end of the}} tenth season of the show, he disclosed that the eleventh season would be his last. The announcement was made public on April 23, 2015, just a few hours before the airing of [...] "How to Save a Life". In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Dempsey explained how the decision could have been made when he had just renewed his contract as he asserted on the natural developments leading up to his exit from the long-running series. He said, [...] "It really was something that was kind of surprising that unfolded, and it just naturally came to be. Which was pretty good. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it has all played out." [...] He went on to share further details on his character being written out of the show, as he said, [...] "Things happened very quickly, where we were like, Oh this is where it’s going to go. It just sort of unfolded in a very organic way." [...] The developments leading up to the eventual exit which he deemed [...] "natural", began in February–March 2016.|$|E
2500|$|Goodman {{enjoyed the}} bebop and cool jazz that was {{beginning}} to arrive in the 1940s. When he heard Thelonious Monk, a celebrated pianist and accompanist to bop players Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and Kenny Clarke, he remarked, [...] "I like it, I like that very much. I like the piece and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he played it. ... I think he's {{got a sense of}} humor and he's got some good things there." ...|$|E
5000|$|Mike Brewer {{can give}} this {{account of the}} origin of the song, [...] "One day we were pretty much stoned and all and Tom says, “Man, I’m one toke over <b>the</b> line tonight.” <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that sounded and so I wrote a song around it.” ...|$|R
5000|$|ACE gave it {{an overall}} review score of 695/1000, calling it {{certainly}} one of the better GAC games released by Incentive." [...] Mike Gerrard of Your Sinclair wrote that [...] "as apart from a few careless screen layouts {{this is one of the}} best GAC games I've yet seen. The speech function is often limited to saying 'Hello' just to get a response from <b>the</b> characters, but <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> authors seem to have successfully packed lots of features into the program. Highly recommended." ...|$|R

2500|$|Upon Watson {{reaching}} the 2011 French Open second round, Andy Murray commented [...] "When I saw {{her for the}} first time, I thought she was good. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> she moves on the court. She's very balanced". Bollettieri stated that Watson's [...] "game is based on great movement, but she's not afraid to whack the ball. She's not easy to beat. She has very good ground strokes, though she can over-hit and strike the ball a little too flat at times".|$|E
2500|$|Devin Charles of Game Revolution {{gave the}} game a {{positive}} review. He scored it a 4.0 out of 5 and praised the [...] "fantastic" [...] presentation, {{the amount of}} depth, the [...] "great" [...] soundtrack, and the involvement of Spike Lee. Charles did feel as though the controls could have been better and disliked the dialogue in MyCareer mode. Charles concluded his review by saying: [...] " [...] possibly the most complete game to the series. Truly when picking a title for yourself it’s all about your preference. I actually like NBA Live 16s Pro-Am more, yet <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> 2K16 presents its product {{on and off the}} court. Having options like playing with old-school teams and players further keeps fans interested. [...] 2K Sports rarely take a step back and this year is no different." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "The Clown" [...] {{tells the}} story of a clown [...] "who tried to please people like most jazz musicians do, but whom nobody liked until he was dead. My version of the story ended with his blowing his brains out with the people {{laughing}} and finally being pleased because they thought it was part of <b>the</b> act. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Jean changed <b>the</b> ending; leaves it more up to the listener." ...|$|R
50|$|We've {{got quite}} a big family and we're all into cycling. I {{remember}} playing out in the garden with my three brothers and sister with little figures that we gave names to. I was usually Greg LeMond, then later I went on to be Miguel Indurain then eventually Laurent Jalabert. I remember LeMond's accent. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he spoke French.

5000|$|An American {{man and a}} Soviet man {{are arguing}} about which country is better. 'At {{the end of the}} day, I can march into the oval office, pound the President's desk and say [...] "Mr. President <b>I</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> you are running this country."', says the American. The Soviet man replies, 'I can do that too. I can march in to the Kremlin, pound the General Secretary's desk and say [...] "Mr. Gorbachev, <b>I</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> President Reagan is running his country!"' ...|$|R

5000|$|Other {{prominent}} pinku eiga directors {{for whom}} Asabuki acted were Shogoro Nishimura in Woman with the Pierced Nipples (Chikubi Ni Pierce O Shita Onna) (1983), and Masaru Konuma in Stewardess Scandal: Hold Me Like an Animal (Stewardess Scandal: Kemono No Youni Dakishimete) (1984). When asked {{to comment on}} Asabuki, Konuma said, [...] "A nice girl. Very responsive. One of the only actresses who could speak multiple languages. I had her talk English in one of <b>the</b> sex scenes. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> it sounded." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I like you, old boy," [...] {{said the}} other. [...] "I was dev'lish lonely in chambers, and wanted somebody, {{and the sight}} of your honest face somehow pleased me. <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> you laughed at Lowton--that poor good little snob.

I'm alone in the world, sir; and I wanted some one to keep me company;" [...] and a glance of extreme {{kindness}} and melancholy passed out of Warrington's dark eyes.|$|R
5000|$|Darren Huckerby criticised Megson's {{coaching}} style, when {{explaining why}} he chose to sign for Norwich City, instead of Megson's West Bromwich Albion. [...] "I told him <b>I</b> didn't <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he coached, <b>I</b> didn't <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he shouted at his players and didn't <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he treated seasoned professionals <b>like</b> 15-year-olds. <b>I</b> was just being honest with him. I said: 'I've seen you {{on the sidelines and}} you look like a crazed animal'". According to Huckerby, Megson's response was that [...] "He told me that was how he had to work with his players".|$|R
6000|$|... "No, she ain't," [...] {{said his}} wife. [...] "I don't know as <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> she's going on, any too well. I'm afraid, if she keeps on, she'll be down sick. She's got deeper {{feelings}} than Irene." ...|$|E

5000|$|Alyse Wax from Fearnet {{also gives}} a good review {{saying that it}} was a very enjoyable episode. [...] "First off, Damon going Dr. Mengele on Wes was a scene of epic beauty. It was swift, it was violent, it was slick. I would not have minded seeing a little more of Damon’s “playtime” with Wes. Katherine going to hell was an obvious choice, but <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> they did it. The comedy of her {{slapping}} Bonnie’s shoulders, trying to get it to work, then just getting swallowed up by darkness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I say, we {{had better}} remain at the inn," [...] rejoined his {{companion}} presently. [...] "I don't think <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> he spoke of his house. I don't like stopping {{in the house with}} such a tremendous lot of women." ...|$|E
6000|$|His comrade, however, {{engaged in}} another thought, didn’t {{so much as}} appear to catch it. “I say, I guess we had better remain at the inn.

5000|$|He {{abandoned}} the album when he realised that [...] "I wasn't {{proud of the}} songs I was writing, and I was performing <b>the</b> music because <b>I</b> <b>liked</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that people reacted rather than because I was proud of the songs." [...] He dropped out of university and [...] "had a real self-destructive moment" [...] and has said that [...] "I felt <b>like</b> <b>I</b> {{was going through a}} quarter or a midlife crisis, but I was not even 20."
