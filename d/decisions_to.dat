40|$|Increasing {{attention}} {{to higher education}} policies in the knowledge-based society makes {{important to understand the}} relationship between socio-economic family characteristics and educational choices. This paper considers the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> go to college in Argentina as a family's economic decision. The goal is to investigate the impact of family income on the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> go to a university versus the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> go to a community college in Argentina. Using a probit model of the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> go to college, the results of this paper show that the income {{of the rest of the}} family has a positive and statistically significant impact on the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> go to college. A multinomial logit model (where the choices are no college, community college or university) shows that the income of the rest of the family is important in order to determine the probability to go to a community college versus the other two possibilities. Family income also has a positive impact in the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> go to a university versus the other two choices. This model also shows that parents education is an important factor in explaining the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> go to a university as well as to go to a community college.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} to analyze; 1) {{the effect of}} political product on the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> choose the candidate of legislative member; 2) the effect of political product on the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> choose political party; 3) {{the effect of the}} <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> choose the candidates of legislative members on the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> choose political party; and 4) the role of mediating variable of the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> choose the candidate of legislative member on the affect the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> choose political party. The data were analyzed using inferential statistical analysis of Generalized Structured Component Analysis (GeSCA). It shows that 1) the political product has an effect on the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> choose the candidate of legislative member; 2) the mediating variable of the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> choose the candidate of legislative member plays a very important role for the constituents in taking the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> choose political party. However, of the existing three indicators, only personal characteristic can explain the strength of the effect of political product on the selection of political party.

5|$|Grove took {{advantage}} of his place in Chicago's starting rotation by winning nine consecutive <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> start his season and by not losing a game until a contest against the Yankees, which he lost {{as the result of}} a balk. At the time, Grove became the second member of the White Sox to win nine consecutive <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> start a season. The first pitcher to win nine straight games for the team was Lefty Williams in 1917, and the only one to do it since Grove was LaMarr Hoyt in 1982. On July 8, 1943, Grove nearly became one of the few pitchers in baseball history to pitch a no-hitter. In a game against the Yankees, he was one out away from pitching a no-hitter when Joe Gordon came up to bat. Gordon hit a double to left field that was fair by inches, ending Grove's closest bid for a Major League no-hitter. Grove finished the season with career bests in ERA (2.75), wins (15), and complete games (18). He led the White Sox that season in ERA, wins, innings pitched, complete games, and strikeouts; at the time, Grove was the youngest pitcher on the team's staff. Grove's personal life improved along with his career. On January 8, 1944, he married Catherine Sloan, having met her at a party thrown for the White Sox by her father, Francis Sloan, a year and a half earlier.|$|E
5|$|The Colombian {{tariff system}} {{is defined in}} the Ley de Servicios Públicos or Public Services Law from 1994. It is applied in public, mixed and private companies. The tariff system aims at {{reconciling}} the achievement of cost recovery with {{the protection of the}} poor.

40|$|Whereas the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> {{outsource}} {{information systems}} (IS) {{has been an}} important focus in IS research and practice, the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> switch vendors or to backsource has received little attention. Evidence suggests that in practice, however, the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> backsource or to switch vendors is becoming increasingly common as firms vie for ways to continue to cut information technology (IT) costs and improve IT service levels. This research specifically examines the factors associated with the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> backsource or to switch vendors. Based on a sample of 160 IT managers involved with application development, we compare and contrast the perceptions of those who switched vendors, backsourced, or continued in an outsourcing relationship for application development. Our findings suggest that product quality, service quality, relationship quality, and switching costs are related <b>to</b> the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> backsource application outsourcing. However, service and product quality did not influence the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> switch vendors. Rather, firms that made the <b>decision</b> <b>to</b> switch vendors reported high levels of service and product quality but low levels of relationship quality and switching costs...|$|R

The effect can be particularly strong when wars or civil disorders lead to extended interruptions in supply.

The captain, if he chooses to kill, is not simply the medium of an effect Jim is having on the world. He is the moral actor, the person with the intentions and projects. The utilitarian loses that distinction, turning us into empty vessels by means of which consequences occur.

As part of the proposed laws, the county sheriff, as opposed to local officials, would become responsible for allowing cities to reopen. Despite extensive resistance, county commissioners approved the change, giving the sitting sheriff power to override municipal evacuation orders. An additional ordinance was proposed to allow banning of alcohol sales during emergencies. During Hurricane Elena, intoxicated individuals created disorder at shelters and impeded evacuations by refusing to leave hurricane parties.|$|E

5|$|BioWare {{provided}} its Aurora Engine from Neverwinter Nights for the sequel. One of the <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> use Aurora {{rather than}} {{build a new}} engine from scratch was the toolset—Obsidian wanted players {{to continue to be}} able to make content for the game, which may not have been possible with a new engine. BioWare made itself available to Obsidian with technical support on the engine, but Obsidian planned on completely overhauling Aurora, including its code. The designers wanted to improve the visuals of the first game with additions such as better lighting and textures, which required significant changes to the engine. The upgraded engine was referred to as Electron. Electron was designed to incorporate DirectX to make it compatible for a potential Xbox 360 release, but Obsidian eventually abandoned plans for a port to the system for financial reasons. The toolset that was used to create the game was also revamped, and included several additions like a customizable interface, a new dialogue format, and building assistants—similar to the wizards found in Microsoft Word and Excel. Like Neverwinter Nights, the toolset was included in the game's release for players to use.|$|E

Hitler created a three-man committee {{with representatives of}} the State, the army, and the Party in an attempt to centralise control of the war economy. The committee members were Hans Lammers (head of the Reich Chancellery), Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, chief of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (Armed Forces High Command; OKW), and Bormann, who controlled the Party. The committee was intended to independently propose measures regardless of the wishes of various ministries, with Hitler reserving most final <b>decisions</b> <b>to</b> himself. The committee, soon known as the Dreierausschuß (Committee of Three), met eleven times between January and August 1943. However, they ran up against resistance from Hitler's cabinet ministers, who headed deeply entrenched spheres of influence and were excluded from the committee. Seeing it as a threat to their power, Goebbels, Göring, and Speer worked together to bring it down. The result was that nothing changed, and the Committee of Three declined into irrelevance.|$|E
