50|$|Jig {{concentrators}} are devices used {{mainly in}} the mining industry for mineral processing, to separate particles within the ore body, based on their specific gravity (relative density). The particles would usually be of a similar size, often crushed and screened prior to being fed over the <b>jig</b> <b>bed.</b> There are many variations in design; however the basic principles are constant: The particles are introduced to the <b>jig</b> <b>bed</b> (usually a screen) where they are thrust upward by a pulsing water column or body, resulting in the particles being suspended within the water. As the pulse dissipates, the water level returns to its lower starting position and the particles once again settle on the <b>jig</b> <b>bed.</b> As the particles are exposed to gravitational energy whilst in suspension within the water, those with a higher specific gravity (density) settle faster than those with a lower count, resulting in a concentration of material with higher density at the bottom, on the <b>jig</b> <b>bed.</b> The particles are now concentrated according to density and can be extracted from the <b>jig</b> <b>bed</b> separately. In the mining of most heavy minerals, the denser material would be the desired mineral and the rest would be discarded as floats (or tailings). There are some minerals, notably coal, that are lighter (lower in density) than the surrounding rock and in such instances the process of extraction would work in reverse, i.e. the coal would settle on top with the rock below (on the <b>jig</b> <b>bed).</b> There are several designs and methods of extraction from the <b>jig</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
40|$|Hughes’ has {{proposed}} a method {{for dealing with the}} problems of interpolating coal washability data which eliminates many of the difficulties encountered in previously proposed procedures. In particular, the problem of the interpolating function becoming negative was solved, but the computational procedure proposed was not suited to convenient computation. Lyman modified the solution to provide a smoother interpolating function, recast the computations in a manner well-suited to fully-automatic operation, and generalised and further extended the method to deal with a more difficult problem relating to interpolation of bulk density, size distribution and density distributions as a function of bed depth in samples taken from a <b>jig</b> <b>bed.</b> These methods were implemented in a major project by the author. This paper presents the mathematical background to both applications and provides an example of their application to simple interpolation of washability information. The second paper of this pair provides examples of the more complex application of the method to data arising from sampling a <b>jig</b> <b>bed</b> in layers, and the third paper considers two-dimensional interpolation of washability data...|$|E
40|$|Based on a {{detailed}} dynamic energy dissipation analysis {{for a large}} experimental data base developed in a highly instrumented and controlled pilot Baum jig, the effects of operating parameters on some important energies in the jigging process have been analyzed. Changes {{in the frequency of}} pulsation and air pressure in the accumulator result in a large change of these energies. According to regression analyses of the energy dissipation data, a new energy hypothesis is proposed, which indicates that the total energy dissipated in the <b>jig</b> <b>bed</b> within a cycle is the vital parameter determining the bed stratification. This energy is the difference between the energy input to the <b>jig</b> <b>bed</b> and the energy recovery on bed collapse. It is a combined product of the operating parameters, bed material characteristics, and jig structure. It can be suggested that for each type of bed material, a certain level of energy input is required to efficiently stratify the bed. This energy hypothesis remedies the defects of the previous jig theories, because the functions of the operating parameters and the air-water phase behaviour parameters are fully considered and analyzed...|$|E
40|$|Methods for {{cleaning}} coal particles greater than 1. 0 mm in size are discussed. Water-based technologies include jigs, dense (heavy) medium baths and cyclones, fluidised beds and Reflux Classifiers (RC). Dry-based methods include air <b>jigs,</b> air-fluidised <b>beds</b> and tables and optical/X-ray sorting. Likely future trends in plant design are discussed. Continued improvement in dry-based methods may see them being used more {{often as a}} preliminary de-stoning step for coarse particles. Improved water-based technologies will enable {{an increase in the}} upper size of the fine coal circuit, from 1 mm up to say 4 mm, which should significantly increase plant capacity...|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} {{particle}} motion subjected to four different pulsation profiles on a pulsated fluidized <b>bed</b> <b>jig</b> concentrator was carried out. The profiles {{used in the}} simulation were – sinusoidal, triangle, sawtooth-backward and sawtooth-forward. Two-dimensional local velocities of the water flow field were calculated from the continuity and momentum equations by CFD techniques implementing SIMPLE algorithm. The particle motion is modeled by a forces balance applying the Newton’s second law of motion. Liquid-solid interactions forces are calculated by the mathematical Euler-Lagrangian model extended to a particle suspension having a wide size and density distribution. To analyze the particle motion in jig, we derived a trajectory equation for the response time of particle that include virtual mass, gravity, pressure gradient, drag and Basset forces. The study demonstrates {{significant differences in the}} particle trajectories for various pulsation profiles applied to the boundary condition at the inlet to the jig chamber...|$|R
40|$|The {{movement}} of particles inside a jig ultimately determines {{the efficiency of}} the jig. The {{movement of}} these particles {{is a function of the}} particle properties (size, density and shape) and the jigging parameters (pulse shape, water flow, etc.). The purpose of this study was to investigate how particle properties affect the movement of particles inside a jig. Positron Emission Particle Tracking (PEPT) is one of the few techniques that can trace the movement of particles inside an enclosed system without interfering with the particle flow and has successfully been used to study mills, hydrocyclones and flotation. In this study, PEPT was evaluated as a possible technique to study the flow of iron ore particles inside a laboratory scale jig. The results showed that very accurate three dimensional trajectories could be obtained, with a temporal resolution high enough to see the movement of a particle during a single pulse. The vertical component from the trajectories showed the rate at which particles moved through the <b>jig</b> <b>bed</b> (stratification rate). The particle property that affected the stratification rate the most was density, followed by size. Shape didn't have a large influence on the stratification rate. However, it was evident that the flat particles have a slightly higher rate, compared to cubic and elongated particles. The PEPT testwork showed the existence of a circular flow pattern (secondary flow) that emerged inside the batch jig. Throughout the test results, the effects of the secondary flow pattern on the movement of the tracer particles was observed. It was seen that particles with densities close to that of the jigging bed were affected the most and that some of these particles showed no degree of stratification. A possible origin of this secondary flow can be the uneven water velocity under the <b>jig</b> <b>bed.</b> The uneven velocity profile was confirmed by looking at the difference in pulse height at different position in the <b>jig</b> <b>bed,</b> with the help of PEPT. None of the existing jigging models in literature take into account this back mixing caused by the secondary flow. An attempt was made to add this effect to King's potential energy model to improve its accuracy with regards to iron ore jigging. From the PEPT observations, the assumption was made that the back mixing experienced by a particle is related to the difference between the mass of the tracer particle and the average particle mass inside the jig. Simulated stratification profiles generated with the modified stratification model were compared to published data of batch iron ore jigging and showed better correlation compared to the standard model.

40|$|AbstractTo {{meet the}} needs of the jigging process control, attempt to combine the {{studying}} on jigging mechanism with the operating and detecting parameters so as to use them in practical producing control. On the basis of studying the motion characteristic of water in jig, the motion of particles with different size and density was researched. A laboratorial model jig and a high-speed dynamic analysis meter were used and 60 group conditions were designed in experiment. The motion rule and curves were gained through analyzing the huge amount of data and pictures with the high-speed dynamic analysis meter. The conclusion is that the characteristic of the position curve of the particles is similar with the typical damped vibration. Then the motion differential equation of the particles was educed imitating the damped vibration and the solution equations were gained. In the equations the motion parameters of the particles in jig, such as velocity, acceleration, force etc. are in a direct proportion to the air pressure, and have a definite non-linear relationship with the jigging cycle, thickness, mobility of the <b>jig</b> <b>bed,</b> mass and size of the particles and so on. The equations might be used directly in control process of jig...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic energy {{dissipation}} within a jigging cycle has been mechanically analyzed using data {{developed in a}} highly instrumented and controlled pilot scale Baum jig. The analysis {{is based on the}} use of the energy and momentum equations for the fluid. It was found that energy balances on the water in the jig failed to close because of elastic deformation of the jig body, rather than inaccuracies in the measurement techniques or failure to account for heat transfer. This deformation problem appears to be common in either pilot jigs or commercial jigs. An empirical means of correcting the energy balance was devised and applied to the data with some success. Using this compensation method, the energy balance was improved. The likely energy balance indicates that (i) less than 7 % of the energy of the incoming compressed air is expended in the jig system, (ii) less than 5 % of the energy from the compressed air is actually dissipated in the <b>jig</b> <b>bed,</b> (iii) the kinetic energy input from the hutch water supply is effectively negligible, in comparison to the energy input from the compressed air, and (iv) about 2. 5 - 3. 7 % of the energy from compressed air is dissipated around the bed plate...|$|E
