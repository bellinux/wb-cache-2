40|$|<b>Double</b> <b>cones</b> {{of birds}} are photoreceptors {{associated}} with motion perception, and perceiving motion is highly important to detect predators. Predation risks varies between habitats and may impose selective pressures {{that could affect}} organisms’ traits. There is evidence that birds show interspecific variations in visual system properties, such as the photoreceptor densities (single and <b>double</b> <b>cones)</b> and distribution across the retina. However, {{little is known about}} the relationship between the distribution of <b>double</b> <b>cones</b> and predator scanning strategies in birds living in different habitats. The goal of this study was to compare <b>double</b> <b>cones</b> distributions of birds that live in open vs. closed habitats. We measured the density and distribution of <b>double</b> <b>cones</b> in 2 species of the order Passeriformes. We found that the density of <b>double</b> <b>cones</b> in both species (open and closed habitat) is greater in the retina dorsal region. This result suggests that other visual traits might be taken into account in future work to better elucidate the relationship between habitat type and sensing motion. Moreover, the White-throated Sparrow had a more homogeneous distribution of <b>double</b> <b>cones,</b> result expected for this closed habitat species. Future work is suggested to be done using more individuals and more species to assess fully understand the evolution of predator- prey interactions and learn how prey can optimize vigilance strategies in different habitats with different predation pressure...|$|R

50|$|The {{conformal}} {{boundary of}} an anti-de Sitter space (or its universal covering space) is the conformal Minkowski space (or its universal covering space) with one fewer dimension. Let's {{work with the}} universal covering spaces. In AQFT, a QFT in the conformal space is given by a conformally covariant net of C* algebras over the conformal space and the QFT in AdS is given a covariant net of C* algebras over AdS. Any two distinct null geodesic hypersurfaces of codimension 1 which intersect at {{more than just a}} point in AdS divides AdS into four distinct regions, two of which are spacelike. Any of the two spacelike regions is called a wedge. It's a geometrical fact that the conformal boundary of a wedge is a <b>double</b> <b>cone</b> in the conformal boundary and that any <b>double</b> <b>cone</b> in the conformal boundary is associated with a unique wedge. In other words, we have a one-to-one correspondence between <b>double</b> <b>cones</b> in CFT and wedges in AdS. It's easy to check that any CFT defined in terms of algebras over the <b>double</b> <b>cones</b> which satisfy the Haag-Kastler axioms also gives rise to a net over AdS which satisfies these axioms if we assume that the algebra associated with a wedge {{is the same as the}} algebra associated with its corresponding <b>double</b> <b>cone</b> and vice versa.

40|$|The {{presence}} of an adverse pressure gradient, shock/shock interaction and shock wave/boundary layer interaction often induces flow separation around bodies. However, the effect of dissociated flow on separated flow characteristics, especially at hypersonic speeds, is still not clear, and considerable differences are observed between experiments and numerical simulations. In this investigation, the unsteady separated flow features around <b>double</b> <b>cones</b> are visualized in the Shock Wave Research Center (SWRC) free piston driven shock tunnel at a nominal Mach Number of 6. 99 using multiple optical techniques. The time resolved shock structure oscillations in the flow field around <b>double</b> <b>cones</b> (first cone, semi-apex angle = 25 °; second cone, semi-apex angles= 50 °, 65 °, 68 ° and 70 °) have been visualized using a high-speed image converter camera (IMACON) at a nominal stagnation enthalpy of 4. 8 MJ/kg. In addition, flow visualization studies around the <b>double</b> <b>cone</b> is also carried out using Schlieren and double exposure holographic interferometry in order to precisely locate the separation point and measure the separation length. The {{presence of}} a triple shock structure {{in front of the}} second cone and a non-linear unsteady shock structure oscillation in the flow field are the significant results from visualization studies on the 25 °/ 65 °, 25 °/ 68 ° and 25 °/ 70 ° <b>double</b> <b>cones.</b> On the other hand, the flow field around 25 °/ 50 ° is relatively steady and Type V shock/shock interaction is observed.

40|$|Abstract: The <b>double</b> <b>cone,</b> a cone over {{a product}} of a pair of spheres, is known {{to play a role in}} the black-hole black-string phase diagram, and like all cones it is {{continuously}} self similar (CSS). Its zero modes spectrum (in a certain sector) is determined in detail, and it implies that the <b>double</b> <b>cone</b> is a co-dimension 1 attractor in the space of those perturbations which are smooth at the tip. This is interpreted as strong evidence for the <b>double</b> <b>cone</b> being the critical merger solution. For the non-symmetry-breaking perturbations we proceed to perform a fully non-linear analysis of the dynamical system. The scaling symmetry is used to reduce the dynamical system from a 3 d phase space to 2 d, and obtain the qualitative form of the phase space, including a non-perturbative confirmation of the existence of the “smoothed cone”.

40|$|A {{hallmark}} {{problem in}} the study of shockwave/boundary-layer interactions (SBLI) is the flow over a <b>double</b> <b>cone.</b> The system of conical shocks interact with a developing boundary layer to produce a region of flow separation. Due to the presence of real gas effects (defined here to mean any deviations from perfect gas behavior resulting from thermal transitions and chemical reactions), air simulations routinely fail to match experimental data at flow enthalpies greater than 6 MJ/kg [1]. The <b>double</b> <b>cone</b> flow has been identified as an exceptionally suitable model problem due to the sensitivity of the separation zone size and heat transfer rates to real gas effects [2]. Numerous researchers have investigated these flow fields both experimentally and computationally [3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

40|$|The retinae of many {{bird species}} contain a {{depression}} with high photoreceptor density {{known as the}} fovea. Many species of raptors have two foveae, a deep central fovea and a shallower temporal fovea. Birds have six types of photoreceptors: rods, active in dim light, <b>double</b> <b>cones</b> that are thought to mediate achromatic discrimination, and four types of single cones mediating color vision. To maximize visual acuity, the fovea should only contain photoreceptors contributing to high-resolution vision. Interestingly, {{it has been suggested}} that raptors might lack <b>double</b> <b>cones</b> in the fovea. We used transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry to evaluate this claim in five raptor species: the common buzzard (Buteo buteo), the honey buzzard (Pernis apivorus), the Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), the red kite (Milvus milvus), and the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). We found that all species, except the Eurasian sparrowhawk, lack <b>double</b> <b>cones</b> in the center of the central fovea. The size of the double cone-free zone differed between species. Only the common buzzard had a double cone-free zone in the temporal fovea. In three species, we examined opsin expression in the central fovea and found evidence that rod opsin positive cells were absent and violet-sensitive cone and green-sensitive cone opsin positive cells were present. We conclude that not only <b>double</b> <b>cones,</b> but also single cones may contribute to high-resolution vision in birds, and that raptors may in fact possess high-resolution tetrachromatic vision in the central fovea...|$|R

The retinae of both species contained rods, <b>double</b> <b>cones</b> and four spectrally distinct types of single cone. Whilst the visual pigments and cone oil droplets in the other receptor types are very similar in both species, the wavelength of maximum sensitivity (lambda(max)) of long-wavelength-sensitive single and <b>double</b> <b>cone</b> visual pigment occurs at a shorter wavelength (557 nm) in the blackbird than in the blue tit (563 nm).
