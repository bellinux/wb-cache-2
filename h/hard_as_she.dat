500|$|During an {{interview}} with entertainment website Digital Spy Dennis discussed Paul's later relationships in depth. Paul's relationship with Lyn Scully (Janet Andrewartha) was short lived, he mistreated her but ultimately in a twist for the character, he did the right thing. Dennis describes this as: [...] "The Lyn story was quite sincere, {{but he had the}} good sense {{on the day of the}} wedding to tell her that he was no good. So he obviously cared about Lyn, but then she came back and haunted him." [...] His relationship with Rebecca Napier (Jane Hall) at times can be fiery, of this Dennis said: [...] "I want to see Paul and Rebecca be like Angie and Dirty Den. I think Rebecca is capable of that. She plays a fiery character and is a very strong. Paul needs somebody who is absolutely there for him and adores him, but will take no shit from him and stand up and fight as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> does." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Beckinsale starred {{opposite}} Sam Rockwell in {{the independent}} drama Snow Angels, {{based on the novel}} by Stewart O'Nan. The harrowing film, in which she played an overwhelmed single mother, put Beckinsale [...] "in kind of a tough place." [...] "I did have my kid, my husband and, in fact, my ex was around a lot, so it was very nice to come home to my people whom I love." [...] Puig felt [...] "Beckinsale gives her best performance in years" [...] while Richard Corliss of Time described it as [...] "her sharpest work yet." [...] However, Scott felt that [...] "her skill and discipline cannot overcome the sense that she is an exotic species transplanted into this grim ecosystem. <b>Hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> works to convince us otherwise, it’s a stretch to believe that a woman with the kind of poised confidence in her own beauty she manifests would wind up with an underachieving mouth breather like Glenn." [...] The film grossed just $414,404 worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|Push and Shove has {{received}} generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 61, based on 23 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic compared it favorably to Stefani's solo albums, stating, [...] "hat's {{the interesting thing}} about Push and Shove, for as much as there are clever contemporary flourishes [...] this is a modest, mature comeback, highlighted by the band's keen awareness of their strengths and subtle, unstated acknowledgment of encroaching middle age." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Melissa Maerz commented that on Push and Shove, Stefani [...] "pogos as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> did in her Anaheim-strip-mall ska days. But she's also just as neurotic, which adds depth to her love songs." [...] In a review for the Los Angeles Times, Mikael Wood opined, [...] "At its best, Push and Shove channels some of the infectiously restless energy of Rock Steady [...] And it further polishes a bold mix-and-match aesthetic that feels familiar today in part because of records such as Tragic Kingdom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{letter for}} me!" [...] Miss Marshall shut {{her door and}} stared at the fat {{envelope}} in amazement. Who could have written it? The postman came only in the morning. Was it some joke, perhaps? Those giggling girls? Miss Marshall's face grew <b>harder</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> lighted her lamp and opened the letter suspiciously.|$|R

2500|$|The Guardian said [...] "despite {{the usual}} collaborators, it is Ciara's {{presence}} that is stamped {{firmly on the}} album. Evidence that she is an under-rated balladeer {{comes in the form}} of [...] "Keep Dancin' on Me", a shimmering slow jam, and the morning-after existential haze of [...] "I Don't Remember", but a terpsichorean swagger remains at the heart of Ciara's world. Few artists go as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> does on her club jams, whether inviting the world to 'kiss my swag' over kinetic freestyle beats on [...] "Pucker Up", combining outraged soprano braggadocio with thunderous crunk baselines on the broiling [...] "High Price" [...] or gliding smoothly through the delectable, sun-kissed [...] "Echo". At her best, her pace is furious, and keeping up is exhilarating." [...] Digital Spy gave it three out of five stars and commented that [...] "Fantasy Ride features much the same cast of producers as countless other R albums from the last couple of years, but these A-list knob-twiddlers rarely try anything risky or inventive here. However, this isn't to say that Fantasy Ride is a bad album. It actually offers a consistently sexy listen with enough minor triumphs – [...] "Love Sex Magic", [...] "Turntables" [...] and the electro-scuzzy [...] "Pucker Up" [...] – to hold your attention. Ciara, meanwhile, is on a seductive form throughout. Ciara's Fantasy Ride deserves the benefit of the doubt." [...] However, Billboard gave it an average review, stating, [...] "On 'High Price,' where she takes her vocals to an opera-like pitch, and her collaboration with the-Dream, 'Lover's Things,' whose faint tenor would seem like an ideal match, Ciara seems to go almost unnoticed. Thankfully, 'Work,' featuring Missy Elliott, has Ciara showing fly-girl antics over a house-like, clap-laden production, and the breakup song 'Never Ever,' featuring Young Jeezy, which samples 'If You Don't Know Me by Now,' pick up the slack." [...] In his Consumer Guide, however, Robert Christgau gave the album a [...] "dud" [...] score (...) [...]|$|E

6000|$|Rose {{turned as}} red as a poppy, {{snatched}} the pen, and flew upstairs, to call herself <b>hard</b> names <b>as</b> <b>she</b> industriously spoiled all Aunt Plenty's new pocket handkerchiefs by marking them [...] "A.M.C." ...|$|R

50|$|Mary Bergen is a {{successful}} clairvoyant who, along with help from her brother Alan and husband Max, aids the police in murder investigations. Unfortunately, she can only sense pieces of the crime as it happens in real time. Her latest case proves to be the <b>hardest</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> is haunted by visions where she can't see the killer's face. She is also being haunted by visions {{of the man who}} tortured her in her childhood, and who also vowed that one day he'll return for her despite dying twenty-four years ago.|$|R
60|$|It {{was easy}} to see that Masouda was pleased at this courteous word, for her voice, which in general seemed a little <b>hard,</b> {{softened}} <b>as</b> <b>she</b> answered, for the first time giving him his own title.|$|R
60|$|Leger did so concisely, and Hetty clenched the chair-arm <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> {{listened to}} him. Still, young as she was, she held herself in hand, and sat very still, with the colour ebbing from her face.|$|E
60|$|Kitty {{was delighted}} to hear that; for she had longed to go, and went on {{skipping}} as <b>hard</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> could, that she might learn some of the graceful steps the shoes took before the day was done.|$|E

60|$|On this summons Kate hastened her {{toilet and}} made her way down the old winding stair to the room in which they had supped the night before. Surely Girdlestone must have had a heart of flint not to be melted by the sight of that fair, fresh face.

50|$|Since the {{escaping}} LC {{high command}} took their most experienced commanders with them, the remaining LC forces {{were forced to}} entrust their primary research complex' defense to a new recruit. The newcomer however performed excellently, even leading a counterattack and driving ED out of the area. They did not give up yet, however. LC spies discovered an ED base still under construction in Ukraine where the next series of attack were expected. The base was protected by four artillery batteries which made the recruit's task even <b>harder,</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> couldn't bring in heavier equipment until they were got rid of.|$|R

60|$|Her amiability {{had cost}} her an effort, and it grew <b>harder</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> opened the song. It was pointed with witty coquetry, and she {{hesitated for a}} moment with a feeling of humiliation, though she meant to play out her part. Andrew and his friends were in peril in the icy wilds; somehow they were at the mercy of this cruel, gross-natured man; and, hateful as her task was, she must not shrink. She thought he could be led on to betray himself. Tingling with shame, she sang with all the fire and art she could command, and Mappin was swept off his feet.|$|R
