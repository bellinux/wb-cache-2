40|$|SUMMARY- We {{describe}} an atypical clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern observed {{during the course}} of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis in a 14 year-old boy. In this patient with a two weeks history of partial complex seizures, the atypical EEG pattern was characterized by an initial left temporal focus which evolved to periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) and, only during the 3 rd and 4 th weeks the typical bilateral and generalized <b>periodic</b> <b>complexes</b> appeared. KEY WORDS: subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, EEG, <b>periodic</b> <b>complexes,</b> partial complex seizure. Since the early reports of Radermecker (1949) 1 2 and Cobb and Hill (1950) 2, the great diagnostic value of electroencephalographic (EEG) findings in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) has been outlined by numerous workers. As is well known, the characteristic EEG pattern consists of high-voltage and polymorphic <b>periodic</b> <b>complexes,</b> recurring at long intervals, grossly widespread throughout both hemispheres 3 that are often associated with motor spasms. In the case reported here, the patient presented partial complex seizures and an atypical EEG finding, making the diagnosis more difficult. We are aware of only one study of SSPE with partial complex seizures 9. REPORT OF CASE HJ, a 14 -year-old boy had partial complex seizures two weeks before being seen at the Escola Paulista de Medicina, that were characterized by loss of consciousness, staring, verbal and gestual automatisms, several times per day. Also, cognitive and intellectual deterioration had developed. A diagnosis of partial complex seizures and behavioural disturbance were made. Despite treatment with anticonvulsants (carbamazepine) th...|$|R
