However, Dempsey did not apologise, saying he did not <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>about</b> the incident and an inquiry was still being conducted. A senior advisor to Afghan President Hamid Karzai warned that Pakistan and Afghanistan may be on a course toward military conflict. Hamid Karzai contacted the Pakistani Prime Minister to discuss the NATO strike and gave his condolences over the deaths of soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Following his announcement, Rasmussen Reports had Barr polling at 6% {{nationwide}} against Barack Obama (42%), John McCain (38%), and Ralph Nader (4%). The study identified Barr as the Libertarian candidate, {{but most}} voters {{said they did}} not <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>about</b> him to have an opinion of him personally. Barr's support in the poll was a net drain on Republicans; he picked up 7% of the Republican vote, 5% of the Democratic vote, and 5% of the unaffiliated vote.|$|E
25|$|While the Champenois {{and their}} French clients {{preferred}} their Champagne to be pale and still, the British were developing {{a taste for}} the unique bubbly wine. The sparkling version of Champagne continued to grow in popularity, especially among the wealthy and royal. Following the death of Louis XIV of France in 1715, the court of Philippe II, Duke of Orléans made the sparkling version of Champagne a favorite among the French nobility. More Champenois wine makers attempted to make their wines sparkle deliberately, but didn't <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>about</b> how to control the process or how to make wine bottles strong enough to withstand the pressure.|$|E

500|$|Lynch {{wrote in}} 1977 that The Homosexual Matrix [...] "had been widely criticized for many reasons", {{including}} for largely ignoring {{the gay rights}} movement and for expressing a negative view of women. According to Lynch, Tripp stated {{in an interview with}} Keith Howes in Gay News that he had not written about the gay liberation movement because he did not <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>about</b> it to be able to discuss the subject, that he was amazed at the accusation of sexism directed against his book, and that he believed the [...] "gay press" [...] had reacted with embarrassment to it, while Howes suggested that Tripp was hurt by the negative reaction to his book from some gay people.|$|E
500|$|Maria Theresa {{found herself}} in a {{difficult}} situation. She did not <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>about</b> [...] matters of state and she {{was unaware of the}} weakness of her father's ministers. She decided to rely on her father's advice to retain his councillors and defer to her husband, whom she considered to be more experienced, on other matters. Both decisions, though natural, later gave cause for regret. Ten years later, Maria Theresa recalled in her Political Testament the circumstances under which she had ascended: [...] "I found myself without money, without credit, without army, without experience and knowledge of my own and finally, also without any counsel because each one of them at first wanted to wait and see how things would develop." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{criticism}} of Vrba {{stems from the}} tension between what Ruth Linn calls survivor and expert discourse. Bauer referred to Vrba's memoir as [...] "not a memoir in the usual sense", alleging that it [...] "contains excerpts of conversations of {{which there is no}} chance that they are accurate and it has elements of a second-hand story that does not necessarily correspond with reality". When writing about himself and his personal experiences, Vrba's account is an important and true one, Bauer wrote, but he argued that Vrba was not justified in seeing himself as an expert on Holocaust history. Vrba often dismissed the opinion of historians. Regarding the numbers killed at Auschwitz, he said that Bauer and historian Raul Hilberg did not <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>about</b> the history of Auschwitz.|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Keith DeCandido {{reviewed}} it on behalf of Tor.com, comparing it to [...] "The Naked Time" [...] and stating that [...] "there's nothing in this episode as entertaining as Sulu bare-chested with an epee, and Wesley being nerdy in the engine room is nowhere near as much fun as Riley singing." [...] He gave the episode a score of two out of ten, remarking that [...] "it's rarely a good idea to do an episode where everyone acts out of character as only the second one out of the gate, since we don't <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>about</b> these people for their acting strange to be meaningful." [...] Cast member Wil Wheaton re-watched the episode for AOL TV, and summed it up saying [...] "whether it was the worst episode ever or not probably rested upon the viewer's expectations. Trekkies who were looking for reasons to hate The Next Generation found plenty" [...] while [...] "viewers who were willing to watch it with an open mind saw flashes of things they came to love watching," [...] and gave it a score of D+.|$|E
500|$|The lockout {{prompted}} indifference {{among most}} American sports fans, {{who thought that}} greed was shown by both sides; the latter was a similar sentiment to what fans voiced during the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike. A CBS News–New York Times poll conducted in October 1998 showed that, while most fans' opinion of professional basketball was unaffected by the work stoppage, 29percent reported that their views had become more negative. The same poll showed that fans backed the NBPA in the dispute by a 36–29 margin, while the general public supported the owners 24percent to 22percent. One-quarter of basketball fans {{who responded to the}} poll stated that they did not <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>about</b> the lockout to give an opinion, along with 45percent of the general public. Media members were frequently critical of the owners and players. Sportswriter Tony Kornheiser described the labor dispute as one [...] "between tall millionaires and short millionaires." [...] An article in Newsweek termed the lockout [...] "an incomprehensible and unconscionable dispute between rival gangs of millionaires". Time Bill Saporito believed that each side was damaged by the lockout, in terms of financial losses and negative publicity. Stern said that he had made concessions in the agreement, while Hunter said that the parties [...] "both blinked." ...|$|E
500|$|Later, {{following}} an e-mail exchange with the expected Republican challenger Toomey about health care, Sestak proposed an unorthodox joint town hall with Toomey about the issue, {{which was held}} September 2 at Muhlenberg College in Allentown. Specter was not invited to participate, and political pollster G. Terry Madonna of Franklin & Marshall College described it as an [...] "informal pact" [...] between Sestak and Toomey to weaken their joint rival, something the two men denied. Commentators suggested Toomey was willing to help Sestak {{at this stage of}} the race because he preferred Sestak as a general election opponent over Specter, who could possibly draw Republican and Independent voters from Toomey. Also in September, Obama appeared in a 30-second television ad for Specter, praising him for his support of the President's economic recovery initiatives. A September poll by Franklin & Marshall College found Specter maintained a 37 percent to 11 percent lead over Sestak, but also that 54 percent of people felt a change was needed as opposed to 34 percent who felt Specter deserved a sixth term. That poll also found 73 percent felt they did not <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>about</b> Sestak to form an opinion, which pollster Madonna said indicated the race would be focused more on Specter's incumbency and record than about Sestak or Toomey.|$|E

Inside Soap {{wondered}} {{if this was the}} biggest clue so far, saying it suggests he has access to money, because flats in London are not cheap. They said it might seem familiar, as Max has rented flats before for his lovers Stacey (when cheating on Tanya), and Tanya (when cheating on Vanessa Gold (Zöe Lucker)). They said Derek also [...] "wouldn't think twice about flashing his cash" [...] and opined that Jack would probably be able to afford it as well. They said viewers do not <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>about</b> Ray yet but he would probably {{not be able to afford}} it with his job as a pub chef, and Michael, although forced to steal from Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) to pay for his wedding, is married to Janine, who is a millionaire. Kate White from Inside Soap later opined that Michael would be able to get the money for the flat as he got Janine to tear up their prenuptial agreement. In relation to the flat, Soaplife focussed on Ray following the dance between him and Kat, and thought that if it was him, then he is [...] "either a secret millionnaire or EastEnders hasn't thought this one through."

2500|$|Chair of the Annapolis Group, and {{president}} of Gettysburg College, Katherine Haley Will, discussed this decision further in a 9 July 2007 article for The Washington Post. [...] In this article, Hill states that this decision was not based upon [...] "a lack of concern about providing accurate, comprehensive information to help {{students and their families}} make decisions about college." [...] Rather, she argued against the methodology of the U.S. News rankings. In particular, she argues against [...] "the largest single factor in the U.S. News rating formula" [...] which is the reputational survey as, [...] "it is unrealistic to expect academic officials to <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>about</b> hundreds of institutions to fairly evaluate the quality of their programs." [...] Hill then argues that, [...] "by contrast, 1 percent of the U.S. News ratings formula is assigned to student-to-faculty ratios, which many faculty members and students consider {{the most important factor in}} educational experience." [...] Hill states that the members of the Annapolis Group will offer the same information in an alternative, free, format which will not rank schools, as, [...] "an educational experience can't be reduced to one number, a school's so-called rank. The simplicity of a rank is understandably more appealing than spending hours poring over college catalogues and visiting campuses, but myriad complex variables can't be reduced to a single number." [...] Instead, Hill asks students and parents to [...] "compare schools on a variety of factors [...] they should visit campuses and go on what feels like a good match rather than relying on filtered or secondhand information. We must encourage students to look inside their hearts and trust their instincts when it comes to choosing a college, not whether parents or friends think a university is cool or prestigious." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{presidents have}} also {{commented on the}} {{reputational}} survey. [...] Former president of Scripps College, Nancy Y.

College presidents, academic deans and deans of admission do not <b>know</b> <b>enough</b> <b>about</b> other institutions to make meaningful comparisons. This gives a false sense of reliability to what is a ranking system without any real validity." [...] Sweet Briar College president, Elizabeth S. Muhlenfeld stated that, [...] "one of our colleagues likened it to trying to rank composers. It's a great analogy. How can you say that Beethoven and Brahms are better than Mahler or Mozart?" [...] Trinity Washington University president Patricia McGuire argued that, [...] "the survey asks me to 'rate the academic quality of undergraduate programs,' assigning each school a single score using a 1-to-5 scale from 'marginal' to 'distinguished.' That I have little real information about these 181 institutions does not seem to matter to the U.S. News editors [...] Some of the actual best colleges in this nation do not fare well in the U.S. News survey because {{they do not have the}} wealth, big-time sports notoriety or public relations clout to influence the peer voting system." [...] Finally, DePauw University president, Robert G. Bottoms, argued that, [...] "I, in fact, did not fill out the reputational survey for this past year. [...] I came to the conclusion that I am not in a position to make judgments on other schools, many of which I have little or no familiarity with. The fact that one quarter of a college's ranking is based upon what is, in essence, its popularity, is very disturbing and we choose not to be a part of the process." ...|$|E
