5|$|The fair catch kick is a rule at the {{professional}} and high school levels of American football that allows {{a team that has}} just made a fair catch to attempt a free kick from the spot of the catch. The kick must be either a place kick or a drop kick, and <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>passes</b> over the crossbar and between the goalposts of the defensive team's goal, a field goal, worth three points, is scored to the offensive team.|$|E
5|$|After the E.coli outbreak, Odwalla {{improved}} {{the safety of}} several of its production processes. Before the fruit enters the factory, it is washed, sorted and sanitized. Once it has reached the plant, the apples, carrots, and citrus fruits are separated and washed again. The fruit is pressed to get the juice, which is then flash pasteurized and bottled. A sample undergoes quality testing, and, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>passes,</b> the batch is shipped in refrigerated trucks to various distribution centers in the United States. Odwalla juice has a relatively short shelf life compared to other beverages and thus must be refrigerated. However, after the introduction of flash pasteurization in 1996 and a new plastic bottle in 2001, the shelf life has been considerably extended. Generally, Odwalla products are sold in special Odwalla-brand displays at grocery and convenience stores, instead of being intermixed with other products.|$|E
5|$|The Boulonnais {{provided}} part of {{the base}} for the Anglo-Norman breed, which was later to play {{a large role in}} the creation of the Selle Francais. It was also used in the creation and refinement of the Italian Heavy Draft, the post-World War II improvement of the Schleswig horse, and the creation of the early 19th-century Ardennes. Some equine scholars theorize that if the smaller Mareyeur had survived, it would have been an ideal horse to cross with the Thoroughbred or Anglo-Arabian to produce a warmblood for competition. In France, a breeding program has been developed by the National Stud to cross Boulonnais and Arabian horses to create a fast, alert driving horse, called the Araboulonnais. This breeding program also brings new blood into the Boulonnais line as, if an Araboulonnais mare is bred to a Boulonnais stallion, and a resulting filly is bred to another Boulonnais stallion, the third generation horse may be inducted into the purebred Boulonnais studbook <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>passes</b> an inspection.|$|E

25|$|Breyer {{agreed that}} the First Amendment protections cannot be {{universal}} for plurality speech, political speech, or government speech. In instances where the speech of government employees is concerned, the First Amendment protections exist only when such protection does not unduly interfere with governmental interests. In cases where the employee speaks as a citizen upon matters of public concern, the speech receives protection only <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>passes</b> the Pickering balancing test. However, prior cases did not decide what screening test a judge should utilize in circumstances where the government employee both speaks upon matters of public concern, and speaks {{in the course of}} his public employee duties.|$|E
25|$|Pieces {{which take}} {{multiple}} steps per move {{are probably not}} allowed to promote by crossing into the promotion zone and back out again: this is not explicitly stated in the rules, and chu shogi does not offer guidance here because such pieces do not promote in chu shogi, but it would contravene the usual stipulation that the move start outside and end inside the promotion zone. Another small piece of evidence is that the fire demon's burn is only calculated {{at the end of}} a turn, like promotion, and it does not apply to intermediate steps in the move. For similar reasons, igui or capturing probably does not allow promotion if the move begins and ends outside the promotion zone, even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>passes</b> in and back out along the way.|$|E

25|$|If the {{computer}} controlling the display knows the exact position {{and color of}} all the subpixels on the screen, it {{can take advantage of}} this to improve the apparent resolution in certain situations. If each pixel on the display actually contains three rectangular subpixels of red, green, and blue, in that fixed order, then things on the screen that are smaller than one full pixel in size can be rendered by lighting only {{one or two of the}} subpixels. For example, if a diagonal line with a width smaller than a full pixel must be rendered, then this can be done by lighting only the subpixels that the line actually touches. If the line passes through the leftmost portion of the pixel, only the red subpixel is lit; <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>passes</b> through the rightmost portion of the pixel, only the blue subpixel is lit. This effectively triples the horizontal resolution of the image at normal viewing distances; the drawback is that the line thus drawn will show color fringes (at some points it might look green, at other points it might look red or blue).|$|E
500|$|Article 41 of the Constitution {{describes}} the National Diet as [...] "the highest organ of State power" [...] and [...] "the sole law-making {{organ of the}} State". This statement is in forceful contrast to the Meiji Constitution, which described the Emperor {{as the one who}} exercised legislative power with the consent of the Diet. The Diet's responsibilities include not only the making of laws but also the approval of the annual national budget that the government submits and the ratification of treaties. It can also initiate draft constitutional amendments, which, if approved, must be presented to the people in a referendum. The Diet may conduct [...] "investigations in relation to government" [...] (Article 62). The Prime Minister must be designated by Diet resolution, establishing the principle of legislative supremacy over executive government agencies (Article 67). The government can also be dissolved by the Diet <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>passes</b> a motion of no confidence introduced by fifty members of the House of Representatives. Government officials, including the Prime Minister and Cabinet members, are required to appear before Diet investigative committees and answer inquiries. The Diet also has the power to impeach judges convicted of criminal or irregular conduct.|$|E

2500|$|The Italian Constitution prescribes {{that both}} {{chambers}} must accept every modification {{to the constitution}} twice within three months, and, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>passes</b> with less than {{two thirds of the}} votes at the second scrutiny, a national referendum on the modification can be held (the reform will make it always possible to call such a referendum). Since the centre-left opposition opposed to the new constitutional reform, describing it as [...] "dangerous", [...] "separatist", and [...] "antidemocratic", the first procedural step, that is, the approval by the Chamber of Deputies, was done successfully in October 2004, but with less than ⅔ of the lower-house votes, making possible the confirmative referendum. The second favourable polling, in Senate, was done in March 2005, whereas the third one occurred on October 20. During the third polling, former UDC leader Marco Follini announced he would abstain from the final vote, not support anymore the constitutional reform, followed by his party fellow Bruno Tabacci.|$|E
2500|$|U.S. State Department {{spokesperson}} Victoria Nuland said: [...] "The resolution {{does nothing}} to get them (Palestinians) closer to statehood, and it may actually make the environment more difficult."

[...] "We've been clear, we've been consistent with the Palestinians that we oppose observer state status in the General Assembly and this resolution.

2500|$|However {{this does}} not mean the current is harmless. [...] Even a small Tesla coil {{produces}} many times the electrical energy necessary to stop the heart, if the frequency happens to be low enough to cause ventricular fibrillation. [...] A minor misadjustment of the coil could result in electrocution. [...] In addition, the RF current heats the tissues it passes through. Tesla coil currents, applied directly to the skin by electrodes, were used in the early 20th century for deep body tissue heating in the medical field of longwave diathermy. [...] The amount of heating depends on the current density, which depends on the power output of the Tesla coil and the cross-sectional area of the path the current takes through the body to ground. [...] Particularly <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>passes</b> through narrow structures such as blood vessels or joints it may raise the local tissue temperature to hyperthermic levels, [...] "cooking" [...] internal organs or causing other injuries. [...] International ICNIRP safety standards for RF current in the body in the Tesla coil frequency range of 0.1 - 1MHz specify a maximum current density of 0.2mA per square centimeter and a maximum power absorption rate (SAR) in tissue of 4W/kg in limbs and 0.8W/kg average over the body. [...] Even low power Tesla coils could exceed these limits, and it is generally impossible to determine the threshold current where bodily injury begins. [...] Being struck by arcs from a high power (> 1000 watt) Tesla coil is likely to be fatal.|$|E

60|$|It is {{not quite}} so clear as to when and where a piece of fiction ceases to be a novella and becomes a novel.

First we have the short story, or novella, {{then we have the}} long story, or novel, and between these we have the novelette, which is in name a smaller than the short story, though it is in point of fact two or three times longer than a short story. We may realize them physically if we will adopt the magazine parlance and speak of the novella as a one-number story, of the novel as a serial, and of the novelette as a two-number or a three-number story; <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>passes</b> the three-number limit it seems to become a novel. As a two-number or three-number story it is the despair of editors and publishers.
