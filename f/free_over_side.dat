In this paper, <b>free</b> surface flow <b>over</b> <b>side</b> weir in different Froude number is simulated by using FLUENT 6. 30 program. Comparisons with the experimental measurements show that the predictions of Longitudinal water surface profiles along the centreline of the channel and Channel discharge rates in side-weir Section are with reasonable accuracy. It was observed that the separation zone area move toward the downstream end of the side-weir by increasing the upstream Froude number...|$|R
