25|$|Several years later, in Alice v. CLS Bank, the Supreme Court readdressed {{the patent}} {{eligibility}} {{of a business}} method. It held patent ineligible a method of securing intermediated settlement—a form of electronic <b>escrow.</b> <b>In</b> invalidating Alice's patent, the Court announced a two-step test based on the Court's earlier decisions in Mayo v.

This test first determines whether the claimed invention is directed to an abstract idea, law of nature, mathematical formula, or similar abstraction, If it is, the court is to proceed to the second step—determining whether the way the claimed invention implements the abstraction contains an inventive concept, as contrasted with being routine and conventional. Under the Alice test, the claimed invention is patent eligible only if it contains an inventive concept.|$|E

The request was granted. On appeal by the Marcoses, the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, in a decision dated December 10, 1997, upheld the ruling of the District Attorney of Zurich granting the request for {{the transfer of the}} funds.

50|$|One {{commentator}} further {{explains that}} the calculations under the enacted escrow statutes were based on an assumption that a nonparticipating manufacturer sold cigarettes nationally. When this was the case, the statutes functioned as intended, permitting the NPM to obtain a refund of excess amounts placed in <b>escrow</b> <b>in</b> each state. However, when an NPM followed a regional sales strategy, as several did, the original escrow statutes allowed the NPM to obtain a refund that was much larger than intended.|$|E

5000|$|Each state {{receives}} a payment equal to its [...] "Allocable Share," [...] {{a percentage of}} the funds held <b>in</b> <b>escrow</b> that has been agreed upon by the settling states and memorialized in the MSA.

50|$|Environmental {{consulting}} spans a {{wide spectrum}} of industry. The most basic industry that environmental consulting remains prominent in is the commercial estate market. Many commercial lenders rely on both small and large environmental firms. Many commercial lenders will not lend monies to borrowers if the property or personal capital does not exceed the worth of the land. If an environmental problem is discovered property owners that deem themselves a responsible party will most likely reserve monies in <b>escrow</b> <b>in</b> order to resolve the environmental impact.|$|E
5000|$|If, {{instead of}} a note, {{consideration}} is held back in an escrow account, installment reporting may be available if the escrow imposes a [...] "substantial restriction" [...] and is arranged to [...] "serve a bona fide interest of the buyer." [...] For example, if the escrow secures representations and warranties of the seller, installment reporting is available to report payments as they are released from <b>escrow.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, if amounts are released from escrow with the mere passage of time, installment reporting is not available.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{traditional}} forward mortgages, {{there are}} no <b>escrow</b> accounts <b>in</b> the reverse mortgage world.

5000|$|In many cases, {{if another}} buyer is not found {{before the end}} of the {{inspection}} period, the wholesaler cancels the original purchase contract (through its cancellation clause) and gets back the deposit. Wholesaling requires little or no money to be secured <b>in</b> <b>escrow,</b> and <b>in</b> most cases the wholesaler never intends to actually purchase the property. The practice of wholesaling is often advertised as [...] "No Money Down and No Risk" [...] by many real estate coaching companies and infomercials since the actual deposit can be as little as $10 and often even the deposit can be returned if the wholesaler cancels the contract {{before the end of}} the inspection period.|$|R
50|$|Because of {{concerns}} that {{widespread use of}} strong cryptography would hamper government use of wiretaps, NSA proposed the concept of key <b>escrow</b> <b>in</b> 1993 and introduced the Clipper chip that would offer stronger protection than DES but would allow access to encrypted data by authorized law enforcement officials. The proposal was strongly opposed and key escrow requirements ultimately went nowhere. However, NSA's Fortezza hardware-based encryption cards, created for the Clipper project, are still used within government, and NSA ultimately declassified and published {{the design of the}} Skipjack cipher used on the cards.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the heart}} of the concept was key <b>escrow.</b> <b>In</b> the factory, any new {{telephone}} or other device with a Clipper chip would be given a cryptographic key, that would then be provided to the government in escrow. If government agencies [...] "established their authority" [...] to listen to a communication, then the key would be given to those government agencies, who could then decrypt all data transmitted by that particular telephone. The newly formed Electronic Frontier Foundation preferred the term [...] "key surrender" [...] to emphasize what they alleged was really occurring.|$|E

50|$|In November 2000, the California Coastal Commission, which regulates {{development}} {{along the}} state's coastline, ruled that development {{had to be}} limited to the upper half ("upper bench") of the Bolsa Chica mesa because the lower half ("lower bench") was too valuable as habitat. Koll—now called Hearthside Homes—sued. The case was eventually dismissed. The developer contributed to the campaign of bond measure Proposition 50, which included specific language to purchase land at Bolsa Chica. Proposition 50 passed, and the state ended up purchasing 118 acre of the lower bench, closing <b>escrow</b> <b>in</b> December 2005. Hearthside was free to develop the upper bench, and their 379-unit project (whittled down from the 5,000+ plan of the 1960s) broke ground in 2006.|$|E

50|$|In some cases, closing <b>in</b> <b>escrow</b> may occur. <b>In</b> this process, a {{title company}} or other trusted party holds {{the money and}} the signed deed, and {{arranges}} for the transfer. This is primarily so that the seller can give up ownership of the property, and the buyer can hand over the payment, without both parties having to be present at the closing at the same time. Escrow ensures an orderly transaction, or if something goes wrong, an orderly termination of the agreement.|$|R

5000|$|The {{original}} escrow statutes {{provided that}} NPM payments {{would remain in}} escrow for 25 years, but authorized an early release of any escrow amount which was greater than the allocable share which that state would have received if the NPM had been an SPM.
