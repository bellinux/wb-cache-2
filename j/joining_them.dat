5|$|When a room is {{occupied}} {{only by a}} single person, some men will position themselves to suggest what they might like from someone <b>joining</b> <b>them</b> in the room: those {{who would like to}} be penetrated anally ("bottoms") will sometimes lie face down on the bed with the door open, while those who prefer to penetrate others ("tops") or to receive fellatio might lie face up.|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} the goal is the penalty area. This area is marked by the goal line, two lines {{starting}} on the goal line 16.5m (18yd) from the goalposts and extending 16.5m (18yd) into the pitch perpendicular to the goal line, and a line <b>joining</b> <b>them.</b> This area {{has a number of}} functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul {{by a member of the}} defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick. Other markings define the position of the ball or players at kick-offs, goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks.|$|E

5|$|Rick Neuheisel {{came off}} the bench to lead the Chargers to three second-half scores. Partly based on this performance, the Buccaneers later signed Neuheisel as a backup quarterback. Although many veteran NFL players crossed the picket line during the week, the Buccaneers were one of only six teams to have no players cross. More than 1,000 area union members joined the Buccaneers regulars in {{picketing}} the game, with some fans tearing up their tickets and <b>joining</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

5|$|A large, cranky sow {{escapes from}} its herd and attacks the Mistress after {{she tries to}} shoo {{it out of her}} garden. Lad charges between them and battles the sow, but with his old age and blunt fangs he struggles with the fight and is badly injured. Bruce and Wolf return from a forest romp in time to aid him, and the younger dogs are able to easily drive her off. While fleeing, the pig runs {{directly}} into the path of one of the Place's cars, driven by a car thief who is knocked unconscious. Lad's feelings are hurt by the battle being finished by the other dogs and the Mistress' holding him back from <b>joining</b> <b>them</b> at the end, but he quickly forgives her.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} by the Board of Works in 1751 concluded that the parliamentary clerk's house was in a poor condition and unsuitable for habitation. In particular, it lacked a kitchen and scullery, and the cooking was still being {{carried out in the}} ground floor rooms of the Jewel Tower. Two three-storey brick houses– later titled 6–7 Old Palace Yard– were built in its place between 1754 and 1755, possibly by the architect Kenton Couse, at a cost of £2,432. The Jewel Tower was accessed from the Old Palace Yard through a central passageway that ran between the houses, and a range of subsidiary buildings were built behind the houses, <b>joining</b> <b>them</b> and the tower, while the tower continued to be used for preparing food.|$|E
5|$|Beckford's Tower in Lansdown {{overlooking}} {{the city of}} Bath, was completed in 1827 for wealthy local resident William Beckford, to a design by Bath architect Henry Goodridge. Beckford was an English novelist, an art collector and patron of works of decorative art, a critic, travel writer and sometime politician, reputed at one stage in his life to be the richest commoner in England. In 1822 he sold Fonthill Abbey, and {{a large part of}} his art collection, to John Farquhar for £330,000, and moved to Bath, where he bought No. 20 Lansdown Crescent and No. 1 Lansdown Place West, <b>joining</b> <b>them</b> with a one-storey arch thrown across a driveway. In 1836 he also bought Nos. 18 and 19 Lansdown Crescent.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} part of {{qualifying}} (Q1), Mercedes was able to refrain from using the faster super-soft tyres, nevertheless setting times below 1:16. Fastest in the session was Romain Grosjean, who was narrowly quicker than the Mercedes drivers, but on the softer tyre compound. With Button not participating, four drivers were left to be eliminated. The two Manor drivers once more did not make the cut and took 18th and 19th on the grid, with Roberto Merhi out-qualifying his teammate Will Stevens {{for the first time in}} a qualifying that both drivers participated in. <b>Joining</b> <b>them</b> on the sidelines were two more prominent drivers: both Sebastian Vettel and Felipe Massa suffered from problems with their power units, finishing 16th and 17th respectively.|$|E
5|$|Many {{thermoplastics}} {{can also}} be welded using chemical solvents. When placed {{in contact with the}} plastic, the solvent will begin to soften it, bringing the surface into a thick, liquid solution. When two melted surfaces are pressed together, the molecules in the solution mix, <b>joining</b> <b>them</b> as one. Because the solvent can permeate the plastic, the solvent evaporates out through the surface of the plastic, causing the weld to drop out of solution and solidify. A common use for solvent welding is for joining PVC or ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) pipes during plumbing, or for welding styrene and polystyrene plastics in the construction of models. Solvent welding is especially effective on plastics like PVC which burn at or below their glass transition, but may be ineffective on plastics like Teflon or polyethylene that are resistant to chemical decomposition.|$|E
5|$|Right {{after signing}} the {{contract}} with the Canadiens, Morenz began to reconsider <b>joining</b> <b>them.</b> Stratford residents, {{as well as his}} senior team, wanted him to stay, and Morenz yielded to the pressure. He wrote a letter in August to Dandurand, explaining that he could not leave Stratford, and included the cheque given to him as a signing bonus. After receiving the letter, Dandurand phoned Morenz and told him to come to Montreal to talk in person. In Montreal, Morenz began explaining his reasons for not signing to Dandurand but began crying and could not finish. In response, Dandurand falsely threatened that if Morenz did not join the Canadiens, his professional hockey career would be over. Hearing this, Morenz relented and agreed to report to the Canadiens' training camp later in the year.|$|E

Jackie {{is pleased to}} see them, but makes a strangely happy remark that her {{deceased}} father will be <b>joining</b> <b>them</b> shortly. Despite Rose's protestations that her grandfather is dead, Jackie insists that he has returned and has been visiting her for some time. A vaguely humanoid and luminous silhouette appears in the flat, surprising both the Doctor and Rose but delighting Jackie before disappearing. TV broadcasts confirm {{that this is a}} worldwide phenomenon and Jackie explains that a few months previously millions of ghosts began appearing all over the world. Humans have come to accept them and believe that they are the manifestations of loved ones.|$|E
5|$|Stansfield's first {{club was}} Evesham Colts under-10s. He played at county level for Worcestershire, Leicestershire and Devon. When his family settled back in Devon he joined Twyford Spartans, scoring 84 goals in 54 matches. He played in Tiverton Town's youth {{team as a}} left back before {{reverting}} to being a striker at his first senior club, non-League side Cullompton Rangers. He later moved to Elmore, where he attracted trials from Exeter City, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Torquay United, {{all of which were}} unsuccessful. His siblings joined the Royal Air Force and he thought of <b>joining</b> <b>them,</b> but continued searching for a breakthrough in professional football.|$|E
5|$|The Sultanates to {{the north}} of Vijayanagara united and {{attacked}} Aliya Rama Raya's army, in January 1565, in a war known as the Battle of Talikota. The Vijayanagara side was winning the war, state Hermann Kulke and Dietmar Rothermund, but suddenly two Muslim generals of the Vijayanagara army switched sides and turned their loyalty to the Sultanates. The generals captured Aliya Rama Raya and beheaded him on the spot, with Sultan Hussain on the Sultanates side <b>joining</b> <b>them</b> for the execution and stuffing of severed head with straw for display. The beheading of Aliya Rama Raya created confusion and havoc in the still loyal portions of the Vijayanagara army, which were then completely routed. The Sultanates' army plundered Hampi and reduced it to the ruinous state in which it remains; it was never re-occupied.|$|E

5|$|After {{the events}} of the comic tie-in , the Master Chief crashes in eastern Africa, where he is found by Johnson and the Arbiter. The Chief, Johnson, and company fight Covenant in the jungle and arrive at a UNSC outpost. Here, Keyes and Lord Hood plan a final effort to stop the Covenant leader, the High Prophet of Truth, from {{activating}} a Forerunner artifact uncovered outside the ruins of the city of New Mombasa. The Chief clears anti-air Covenant defenses so Hood can lead the last of Earth's ships against the Prophet, but Truth activates the buried artifact, creating a slipspace portal which he and his followers enter. A Flood-infested ship crash-lands nearby; Elite forces arrive and vitrify Flood-infected areas of Earth, stopping the threat. Following a message Cortana left aboard the Flood ship, the Chief, Arbiter, Elites, Johnson, Keyes and their troops follow Truth through the portal. <b>Joining</b> <b>them</b> is 343 Guilty Spark, who aids the Chief as he has no function to fulfill after the destruction of his ringworld.|$|E
5|$|As Saeed was {{the vice}} {{president}} of the Iraq Football Association, which was headed by Uday Hussein, in the 1990s, there were many controversies about him being a Ba'athist and a Saddamist. He was also accused of being of a Palestinian descent, torturing players, giving positions to Tikritis. Accusations also went to say that Saeed was Uday's representative in robbing Kuwaitis in the 1991 Gulf War. Documents were put on the internet by some news agencies that suggest that Saeed, Najeh Humoud and Moayad Al-Badri worked for the Iraqi Intelligence Service in 2002 by gathering information on their targets. The documents included Saeed gathering information about Al-Badri when he was staying in Saudi Arabia before <b>joining</b> <b>them</b> himself. They also show the approval of the Personal Secretary of Former President Saddam Hussein, Abid Hamid Mahmud, of paying Saeed $50,000 after completing his mission and him signing on receiving $25,000. One of the documents showed him and Al-Badri executing a mission to monitor an alleged Israeli spy in Syria and showed him arresting Yahya Alwan before travelling to Saudi Arabia.|$|E
5|$|Contre-Admiral Leissègues' {{squadron}} was unchanged {{from the}} force that left Brest on 13 December. All ships however, especially Jupiter and Diomède, had been badly damaged by storms off the Azores in late December and repairs were incomplete {{by the time of}} Duckworth's attack, most the fleet still undergoing caulking at Santo Domingo. Recognising that if he was caught at anchor he would be destroyed, Leissègues sent orders from his offices in Santo Domingo for the fleet to sail, <b>joining</b> <b>them</b> later by small boat. Trapped against the land with the wind from the west, Leissègues had no option but to form a line of battle and wait to meet the British squadron. Although his ships fought hard, they were unable to mutually support one another and were rapidly overwhelmed: three surrendered, while Diomède and Impérial were driven ashore and wrecked to prevent their capture. The only ships to escape were the two frigates and a corvette that and slipped between the French line and the land early in the battle and made sail to the west, eventually reaching France.|$|E
