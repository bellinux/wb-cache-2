The theme of the tournament, [...] "virtue and love", was {{represented}} by two chariots, one containing ladies dressed as the five virtues, the other carrying Venus and Cupid and many mini-cupids. In the tournament itself, little balls of fire were lobbed among the horses as they crossed. The royal grandstand was hung with gold-and-silk tapestries illustrating the triumph of Scipio, which Giulio Romano had designed for Francis I. Brantôme recalled in his memoirs that [...] "the Spanish lords and ladies greatly admired it, never having seen anything like it in the possession of their king". Another French spectator recorded, [...] "Strangers of all nations were now forced to recognise that <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> France had surpassed, with these parades, bravado, glories and magnificences, all other nations and even herself".|$|E

[...] The gods delight <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> and are nourished. Feeling wonderful, they are taken around until they make a complete circle. On the way they are able to see Justice, Self-control, Knowledge, and other things as they are in themselves, unchanging. When they have seen all things and feasted on them, coming all the way around, they sink back down inside heaven.|$|E

The school pledge was composed in 1961 by a school teacher and consists of: The future is a challenge, let us excel our lives with power and purpose, let us excel. [...] The prefect's pledge was introduced in 1962 and says: [...] "I promise at all times and in all places,to maintain the honour of the school; that with sincerity , justice and integrity , I will discharge my duties so that <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> I shall excel , for what I am , this school will be."

2500|$|It is clear, then, that a {{human being}} {{is more of a}} {{political}} [...] animal [...] than is any bee or than any of those animals that live in herds. For nature, as we say, makes nothing in vain, and humans are the only animals who possess reasoned speech [...] Voice, of course, serves to indicate what is painful and pleasant; that is why it is also found in other animals, because their nature has reached the point where they can perceive what is painful and pleasant and express these to each other. But speech [...] serves to make plain what is advantageous and harmful and so also what is just and unjust. For it is a peculiarity of humans, in contrast to the other animals, to have perception of good and bad, just and unjust, and the like; and the community <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> makes a household or city [...] [...] By nature, then, the drive for such a community exists in everyone, but the first to set one up is responsible for things of very great goodness. For as humans are the best of all animals when perfected, so they are the worst when divorced from law and right. The reason is that injustice is most difficult to deal with when furnished with weapons, and the weapons a human being has are meant by nature to go along with prudence and virtue, but it is only too possible to turn them to contrary uses. Consequently, if a human being lacks virtue, he is the most unholy and savage thing, {{and when it comes to}} sex and food, the worst. But justice is something political , for right is the arrangement of the political community, and right is discrimination of what is just. (Aristotle's Politics 1253a 1.2. Peter Simpson's translation, with Greek terms inserted in square brackets.) ...|$|E
