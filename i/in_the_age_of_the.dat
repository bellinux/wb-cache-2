5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> auto trail, {{the roads}} that later formed US2 through the UP {{were given a}} few {{different}} highway names. When the original roadways between Ironwood and Iron River were completed in late 1915, the Upper Peninsula Development Bureau (UPDB) named the area Cloverland and the highway the Cloverland Trail. Later the name was extended over the highway to Escanaba, and to all highways {{in the area in}} the early 1920s; the name was phased out by the UPDB completely in 1927. The roadways were also used for the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway, named for former US president Theodore Roosevelt after his death in 1919. Overall, this highway ran from Portland, Oregon, to Portland, Maine, by way of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario. Through the UP, the southern branch followed the immediate predecessors to US2, including the section through Florence County, Wisconsin.|$|E

In August 2012, she wrote a column in The New York Times complaining about unrealistic weight and beauty expectations for new moms, set by celebrities.

5|$|Following the {{collapse}} of centralized government, much {{of the legal system}} and most of the educational institutions and social services fell under the control of religious institutions, which often received significant funding and support from international charities. In 2005, some of these clerical organizations united to form the Islamic Courts Union, after the secular rebel leaders began to challenge the sharia-based judicial institutions. Wary of Islamist paramilitaries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> War on Terror, the CIA funneled {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} to secular rebel leaders inside Somalia in 2006, intending thereby to neutralize the threat of suspected members of Al Qaeda they believed to be sheltered by the ICU. This was cited by experts as a factor in the resurgence of Islamic militias in the country, prompting the latter to engage in pre-emptive strikes which routed the rebel leaders and led to the seizure of Ford by the ICU. The ICU gained control of Mogadishu and its surrounding districts in June 2006, after the Second Battle of Mogadishu. The ICU was later overthrown by the Ethiopian military with the support of the United Nations, African Union, and the United States government. After the ICU forces were chased from Mogadishu, the leaders of the Transitional Federal Parliament entered Somalia declaring themselves the rightful governors of Somalia. As of October 2007, there was still widespread opposition within Somalia to the TFG, and the TFG's leaders and their allies were still attempting to suppress a strong insurgency. In January 2009 politician Abdirahman Ahmed was executed for alleged apostasy by a Sharia court.|$|E

This is an experimental study using swimming skill tests as the data collection method. <b>The</b> populations <b>in</b> this research were the members of Tirta Taruna and Tirta Agung swimming associations who were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ages</b> <b>of</b> 5 and 7 years. The subjects were 32 children consisting 9 children <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 5 and 5 children <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 7 from Tirta Agung swimming association, and 7 children <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 5 and 11 children <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> 7 from Tirta Taruna swimming association. The instruments were adopted from the arrangement results of swimming rating scale for S 1 students of Coaching Education Department of Faculty of Sport Science, Yogyakarta State University conducted by Samodra (2005). It used the pre and post tests <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of crawl style swimming through the pool width (15 meters) and provided judge observation to give scores on {{the effectiveness of}} the style. The data were analyzed using one-way statistics program of ANAKOVA (SPS- 2000). This study results in F = 22. 731 with db (1. 30) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> significance level of 5 % gaining F table of 4. 17.

This myth has been interpreted as Plato's philosophy of history or his metaphysical cosmology. But Seung interprets it as Plato's explanation for his shift from the government by virtues <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Republic to the government by laws <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Laws. By <b>the</b> myth <b>of</b> two <b>ages,</b> Seung says, Plato expresses his realization that the Kallipois is unfit for our age because we are living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> Zeus rather than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> Kronos.|$|R
