5|$|The {{technicians}} {{start the}} washing process immediately, since delay can cause fermentation of the sugary coating surrounding the bean and ruination {{of the coffee}} flavour. The beans are first thrown into a <b>deep</b> <b>tank.</b> The best cherries sink {{to the bottom and}} pass through a machine that removes their skin. The technicians remove any floating cherries and process them {{in the same way as}} the others for the cooperative to sell on the domestic market for less than specialty-coffee price. The beans are fed through one of the cooperative's three de-skinning and selection machines to remove their skins and most of the sugary coating before running the individual beans through a vibrating colander. The colander separates the very highest quality Grade A beans from those labeled Grade B; the two grades are sent separately down the hill in a water chute with a 1 percent gradient. This process allows for further separation of beans based on quality, with around 15 tanks available at the bottom for capture of the different types. The beans are kept submerged, two days for the best and 15–20 hours for the lesser beans, which causes a small amount of fermentation to convert the remainder of the sugar without significantly impairing the flavour.|$|E
60|$|Their {{position}} {{was a very}} strong one. An extensive morass and a <b>deep</b> <b>tank</b> covered their front. On their left was a fortified village; and on their right the fort of Deeg, which was supported by several lines of batteries.|$|E
6000|$|There {{was quite}} a lot of rose garden, it made the air delicious, and it was full of great {{tumbling}} bushes of roses and of neglected standards, and it had a long pergola of creepers and trailers and a great arbour, and underneath over the beds everywhere, contrary to all the rules, the blossom of a multitude of pansies and stock and little trailing plants swarmed and crowded and scrimmaged and drilled and fought great massed attacks. And then Mr. Britling talked their way round a red-walled vegetable garden with an abundance of fruit trees, and through a door into a terraced square that had once been a farmyard, outside the converted barn. The barn doors had been replaced by a door-pierced window of glass, {{and in the middle of}} the square space a <b>deep</b> <b>tank</b> had been made, full of rainwater, in which Mr. Britling remarked casually that [...] "everybody" [...] bathed when the weather was hot. Thyme and rosemary and suchlike sweet-scented things grew on the terrace about the tank, and ten trimmed little trees of Arbor vitae stood sentinel. Mr. Direck was tantalisingly aware that beyond some lilac bushes were his new-found cousin and the kindred young woman in blue playing tennis with the Indian and another young man, while whenever it was necessary the large-nosed lady crossed the stage and brooded soothingly over the perambulator. And Mr. Britling, choosing a seat from which Mr. Direck just couldn't look comfortably through the green branches at the flying glimpses of pink and blue and white and brown, continued to talk about England and America in relation to each other and everything else under the sun.|$|E

50|$|The National Marine Aquarium is {{the largest}} marine {{aquarium}} in the United Kingdom, with around 400 marine species, including a <b>deep</b> <b>tank</b> holding 2.5 million litres (550,000 Imperial gallons) of water. The aquarium opened in 1998.|$|E
50|$|Sheet films can be {{processed}} in trays, in hangers (which {{are used in}} <b>deep</b> <b>tanks),</b> or rotary processing drums. Each sheet can be developed individually for special requirements. Stand development, long development in dilute developer without agitation, is occasionally used.|$|R
50|$|The hull was {{subdivided}} {{by seven}} transverse bulkheads, all watertight {{to the main}} deck. Five cargo holds were provided: three forward and two aft of the machinery space. Cargo was handled through five hatches, one for each hold. <b>Deep</b> <b>tanks</b> were provided for 702 tons of liquid cargo.|$|R

50|$|The {{cobalt blue}} {{tarantula}} is a mainstay in the pet trade, despite being a fast and defensive tarantula with potent venom. Studies suggest that bites from this species can result in severe muscle cramps and inflammation. Typically they are kept in a <b>deep</b> <b>tank</b> with 25 to 30 cm (10-12 inches) of substrate such as peat moss or coco-husk that is kept humid.|$|E
50|$|Lieutenant Junior Grade Seizo Ishikawa, the Japanese {{commander}} {{in charge of}} defending Makin, ordered his troops to build extensive fortifications on the island. These included 8-inch coastal defense guns, 37-mm anti-tank gun positions, machine gun emplacements, rifle pits, 15-foot (4.5 m) <b>deep</b> <b>tank</b> barriers with anti-tank guns, and barbed wire. These were designed to hold the island until reinforcements could arrive.|$|E
5000|$|Colorful escarpments, calico-colored mountains, maze-like {{canyons and}} broad, majestic bajadas come {{together}} here. Steep canyons and cliff-like walls form dry falls along deep drainage channels, creating cascades during heavy rain storms. More {{than a half}} dozen natural water [...] "tanks" [...] sit within the lava flow. Two of the tanks, Hidden Tank and <b>Deep</b> <b>Tank,</b> hold thousands of gallons of water, drawing wildlife.|$|E
25|$|Sewage liquor is {{run into}} <b>deep</b> <b>tanks</b> with {{diffuser}} grid aeration {{systems that are}} attached to the floor. These are like the diffused airstone used in tropical fish tanks but on a much larger scale. Air is pumped through the blocks and the curtain of bubbles formed both oxygenates the liquor and also provides the necessary mixing action. Where capacity is limited or the sewage is unusually strong or difficult to treat, oxygen may be used instead of air. Typically, the air is generated by some type of blower or compressor.|$|R
25|$|The hull was double {{bottomed}} with {{a capacity}} of 2,270 tons of fresh water for boilers or ship use with trimming tanks in the peaks and three <b>deep</b> <b>tanks,</b> one forward and two aft of the engine room, for a total water ballast of 4,600 tons. There were five complete decks composed of orlop, lower, middle, upper and shelter decks with the strength deck at the shelter deck rather than usual upper deck with ten watertight bulkheads running up to the upper deck. Normal coal capacity was 1,950 tons but that could be increased by use of reserve bunkers to 2,800 tons.|$|R
5000|$|Alfred Hickling at the Guardian {{reviewed}} Stevenson's work:To {{arrive at}} a true understanding of Anne Stevenson's poetry, {{you have to go}} deep. In fact, the Deep is a very good place to start. Jutting into the Humber estuary like a vast steel fin, the Deep is Hull's impressive new aquatic attraction - where you expect to find tropical fish rather than topical poetry - yet the first thing the visitor sees, before descending to the bottom of Europe's <b>deepest</b> <b>tank,</b> is a line by Stevenson: [...] "The sea is as near as we come to another world." ...|$|R
50|$|The hull was all steel {{construction}} {{with a double}} bottom, large hatches and cargo booms capable of handling up to 50 ton loads and four cargo ports {{on each side of}} the vessel. A <b>deep</b> <b>tank</b> between #2 and #3 holds, extending to the lower deck, was provided for carriage of molasses or fuel oil with a dedicated pump for loading and unloading.|$|E
50|$|HMS Dolphin {{closed as}} a {{submarine}} base on 30 September 1998, although the last RN submarine permanently based at Gosport was HMS Ursula which had left {{4 years earlier}} in 1994. The Royal Navy Submarine School (RNSMS) remained at Dolphin until 23 December 1999 when it closed prior to relocation to HMS Raleigh. The RNSMS staff marched into HMS Raleigh and were welcomed onboard by Commodore Lockwood on 31 January 2000. The RNSMS {{is located in the}} Dolphin and Astute blocks at Raleigh, although the Submarine Escape Training Tank (SETT), a 30m <b>deep</b> <b>tank</b> of water used to instruct all RN submariners in pressurised escape, remains at the same site, now renamed Fort Blockhouse.|$|E
50|$|Jet aerators do {{not require}} any {{external}} air source (i.e. compressor), except for the surrounding atmosphere. Jet aerators can be installed either as submersible units or piped through the tank wall using an external dry-installed chopper pump to feed the aspirating ejector(s). Jet aerators are easily configured into any basin geometry including circular, rectangular, looped reactors and sloped wall basins. Jet aerators are ideally suited for <b>deep</b> <b>tank</b> processes. The jet oxidation ditch {{is an example of}} technology innovation where the combination of a deeper basin design, bottom to top mixing and conservation of momentum combines to make a very efficient treatment process. In this and other applications the independent control of oxygen transfer and mixing is a valuable feature for both process control and energy savings.|$|E

40|$|This report {{deals with}} a method for calculating the heating {{capacity}} {{and the length of}} heating coils, required for <b>deep</b> <b>tanks</b> in dry cargo ships. It is based on the theory of natural convection and on experiments, carried out on tanks loaded with mineral oils. The calculating method is set up for some liquid cargoes which are very unfavourable with respect to the required heating capacity and coil length. To facilitate calculations, a number of diagrams is given. The report can also be used for calculating the heating capacity and the length of heating coils for product carriers, intended to carry the same cargoes...|$|R
50|$|These caves {{located at}} Uperkot beyond the 300 feet deep moat, close to Adi Kadi vav, were carved in 2nd-3rd century A.D. These caves have {{influence}} of Satvahana architecture with combination of Graeco- Scythian style. According to ASI “The cave group is in three tiers, with {{all members of}} each galleries shown in semi-relief, but only two storeys having regular floors. The upper floor has a <b>deep</b> <b>tank,</b> covered on three sides with verandahs and Kakshasana on west and north- west side. Lower floor has with corridor and pillars. The lower floor has exquisitely carved pillars whose base, shaft and capital carry unique decorative design.” These caves are gilded with beautiful pillars and entrances, water cisterns, horseshoe shaped chaitya windows, an assembly hall and cell for meditation.|$|E
50|$|The medical {{application}} to industrial microbiology is {{the production of}} new drugs synthesized in a specific organism for medical purposes. Production of antibiotics {{is necessary for the}} treatment of many bacterial infections.Some natural occurring antibiotics and precursors, are produced through a process called fermentation. The microorganisms grow in a liquid media where the population size is controlled in order to yield the greatest amount of product. In this environment nutrient, pH, temperature, and oxygen are controlled also in order to maximize the amount of cells and cause them not to die before the production of the antibiotic of interest. Once the antibiotic is produced it must be extracted in order to yield a income. Penicillin production is an example of massively producing an antibiotic using <b>deep</b> <b>tank</b> fermentation.|$|E
50|$|According to ASI “The cave {{group is}} in three tiers, with {{all members of}} each {{galleries}} shown in semi-relief, but only two storeys having regular floors. The caves at Uparkot are cut into two ﬂoors. On the ﬁrst ﬂoor, there is a Kunda, a <b>deep</b> <b>tank</b> about 11 feet square, with a covered verandah round three sides of it. There is a big chamber with six pillars supporting the roof adjoining it. Under the corridor, {{in the rest of}} the area, in the walls on the north-east and west sides are stone bench-recesses, divided into long compartments with a base moulded in architectural courses below, and a frieze above, ornamented with horseshoe shaped chaitya windows and checker carvings. On the lower ﬂoor, there are similar rooms, having a corridor, pillars supporting the ﬂoor above, stone bench-recesses and above them, the chaitya-window ornament.|$|E

50|$|The {{building}} is square in shape, {{is composed of}} a crenellated walls strengthened by three towers. In defense of the main stands one of the towers that were accessed by a drawbridge, later replaced by a brick bridge. The tower is about 30 meters tall and consists of four floors, of which the first three are cross vaulted.The basement of the tower, illuminated by two high slits at the base, was once used as a prison {{as evidenced by the}} large iron rings fixtures on the walls.On two adjacent sides of the court, provided {{at the center of a}} <b>deep</b> <b>tank,</b> rise two porches with arches supported by cylindrical pillars of brick.On the first floor another portico flanked by a large living room, probably the part of the castle that was used as a residence. The courtyard leads to a Baroque chapel built by the Jesuits.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} is entered {{through the south}} side through two separate doorways, each with Corinthian columns distyle in antis, thus immediately establishing symmetry within the plan of the structure. The doorways open into bench-lined vestibules leading to anterooms that open directly onto the southern portico. Between the two anterooms is a long, shallow hall lined with benches and faced with Ionic columns. This room is identified as the apodyterion, or undressing room, a space that {{would need to be}} close to the main entrance and have room for athletes and friends to meet. Directly across from the apodyterion, along {{the north side of the}} palaestra is the ephebion, or clubroom. This large, colonnaded hall is deeper than the apodyterion but does not run the entire length of the courtyard. The entire north side of the palaestra has deep rooms, a feature mentioned by Vitruvius, which offered shelter from the sun. Also in the north side of the {{building is}} a doorway that leads directly into the rest of the adjoining gymnasium space. The room in the northeast corner of the palaestra is identified as a bathroom. The brick-lined, 4 meter square and 1.38 meter <b>deep</b> <b>tank</b> found here is dated to the Roman period, however.|$|E
50|$|The {{technicians}} {{start the}} washing process immediately, since delay can cause fermentation of the sugary coating surrounding the bean and ruination {{of the coffee}} flavour.

As with much of the north shore, the area is decidedly more urban than is typical of Staten Island, evinced in the architecture (predominantly tall brick buildings) and numerous retail stores and eateries. Unlike many other North Shore communities (and like Port Richmond), the neighborhood has no public housing projects. Its housing stock is dominated by single-family homes built in the first few decades of the 20th century.|$|R
