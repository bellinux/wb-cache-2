5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1944, Ron Jeffery, an agent of British and Polish intelligence in occupied Poland, eluded the Abwehr and travelled to London with a report from Poland to the British government. His efforts were at first highly regarded, but subsequently ignored by the British, which a disillusioned Jeffery attributed to the treachery of Kim Philby and other high-ranking communist agents <b>entrenched</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British system. Jeffery tried to inform the British government about the Katyn massacre, but was as a result released from the Army.|$|E

5|$|The 1st Battalion {{embarked}} for France in March 1916, and by April {{the unit}} was <b>entrenched</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Fromelles sector. In {{the third week}} of July, Howell was wounded in the Battle of Pozières while taking part in the Somme offensive. Evacuated to a hospital in Sheffield, England, during early August, Howell attended a training school before returning to his battalion on 26 November. Appointed lance corporal on 10 December, he was promoted to corporal on 6 February 1917.|$|E
5|$|To {{expand his}} power, Napoleon used these {{assassination}} plots {{to justify the}} creation of an imperial system based on the Roman model. He believed that a Bourbon restoration would be more difficult if his family's succession was <b>entrenched</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> constitution. Launching yet another referendum, Napoleon was elected as Emperor of the French by a tally exceeding 99%. As with the Life Consulate two years earlier, this referendum produced heavy participation, bringing out almost 3.6 million voters to the polls.|$|E
5|$|An Israeli {{reserve unit}} {{was called in}} from Tiberias. It arrived after twenty minutes and took {{positions}} around the town. At that point, Samakh (Tzemah) was defended by three platoons from the Barak battalion and reinforcements from neighboring villages. They <b>entrenched</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> actual village, which had been abandoned by the residents in April 1948, with British escort. Positions in the village included the police station in the west, the cemetery in the north, the Manshiya neighborhood in the south, and the railway station. The Syrians set up their positions in an abandoned British military base {{just east of the}} village and in an animal quarantine station to the southeast.|$|E

5|$|By 15th century, the Malacca Sultanate, whose hegemony {{reached over}} much of the western Malay archipelago, had become the centre of Islamization in the east. The Malaccan {{tradition}} was transmitted onwards and fostered a vigorous ethos of Malay identity. Since this era, the Islamic faith became closely identified with Malay society and {{played a significant role in}} defining the Malay identity. The close identification of the Malays with Islam continued until the 20th century and was finally <b>entrenched</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia as well as in the national philosophy of Brunei known as the Malay Islamic Monarchy.|$|E
5|$|General Manteuffel {{had been}} injured in {{the attack on the}} position. Wedel ordered a full cavalry assault through the woods and against the Russian right flank. When the {{superior}} Russian force countered, Prussian momentum faltered with the lack of a second column of timely reinforcement. Repeated assaults on the Russians <b>entrenched</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heights resulted in massive losses for the Prussians. In the last of these assaults, Moritz Franz Kasimir von Wobersnow led eight battalions and six squadrons from Züllichau against the Russian right wing. At the same time his cavalry penetrated the enemy's infantry line, but the Russian cavalry, supported by gun-fire, drove them and the infantry back into the low ground.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} {{for an attack}} on the Hindenburg Line at Bullecourt, the 1st Australian Brigade—of which the 1st Battalion was part—was attached to the 2nd Australian Division. The attack commenced in the morning of 3 May 1917, with the 2nd Division lined up in conjunction with thirteen other divisions. Despite some progress made early in the attack, the Australian forces were soon held up by strong opposition, and in the evening the 1st Battalion was <b>entrenched</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> old German line known as 'OG1'. Three of the battalion's companies occupied the line, while a fourth was placed in reserve. Their position was such that they occupied a wedge into the German line, while two flanks were in German held territory.|$|E

5|$|On 20 December, Canadian forces {{tried again}} and The Royal Canadian Regiment {{attacked}} Cider Crossroads at noon. This time, Vokes {{was determined that}} the operation would be successful, with armoured forces of the Three Rivers Regiment moving to the start lines well before 07:00. Due to shortages of fuel and poor weather, H-Hour was postponed until 14:15. When H-Hour came, a powerful creeping barrage supported two companies of the Royal Canadian Regiment eastward. By evening, B Company controlled the Cider Crossroads, having met virtually no resistance in their advance to the objective. However, German forces had already evacuated The Gully, falling back {{to prepare for a}} strong defence of Ortona, with elements of the powerful 1st Parachute Division firmly <b>entrenched</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town.|$|E
5|$|Up to this point, Brown {{had scored}} 800 runs on tour {{at an average}} of 72.72, while Loxton had made 310 runs at 51.66. Harvey had scored only 296 runs at 42.29. The other five places in the top six were firmly <b>entrenched</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hands of Barnes, Morris, Bradman, Hassett and Miller, who had all played in those {{positions}} regularly since the end of World War II. Brown gained selection out of position in the middle order in the First Test at Trent Bridge, while Loxton and Harvey watched from the sidelines. There was a chance one of them would receive a last-minute call-up as Barnes was ill with food poisoning in the week leading up to the Test, but the opener recovered. Brown made only 17 as Australia won by eight wickets.|$|E
5|$|While Alvarado was {{consolidating}} {{his power}} in the Ulúa valley, Juan de Chávez's expedition in southern Higueras had met stiff resistance. They had marched up the Naco valley to the Peñol de Cerquín ("Rock of Cerquín"), which had been bypassed by Alvarado on his initial incursion. The Peñol de Cerquín was a formidable rocky butte that had been fortified by the natives. A great number of Indians had amassed at the fortress, which dominated the whole of southern Honduras. The natives were <b>entrenched</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fortress, and determined to resist any Spanish attempt to pass. It is not known who led the indigenous resistance at this time, but it {{may well have been}} Lempira, a war leader who would later distinguish himself against the invading Spanish.|$|E

5|$|During Modi's {{second term}} {{the rhetoric of}} the {{government}} shifted from Hindutva to Gujarat's economic development. Modi curtailed the influence of Sangh Parivar organisations such as the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) and the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), <b>entrenched</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state after the decline of Ahmedabad's textile industry, and dropped Gordhan Zadafia (an ally of former Sangh co-worker and VHP state chief Praveen Togadia) from his cabinet. When the BKS staged a farmers' demonstration Modi ordered their eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in Gandhinagar deepened the rift with the VHP. Sangh organisations were no longer consulted or informed in advance about Modi's administrative decisions. Nonetheless, Modi retained connections with some Hindu nationalists. Modi wrote a forward to a textbook by Dinanath Batra released in 2014, which stated that ancient India possessed technologies including test-tube babies.|$|E
5|$|For some Germans, the {{definition}} of nation did not include pluralism, and Catholics in particular came under scrutiny; some Germans, and especially Bismarck, feared that the Catholics' connection to the papacy might make them less loyal to the nation. As chancellor, Bismarck tried without much success to limit {{the influence of the}} Roman Catholic Church and of its party-political arm, the Catholic Center Party, in schools and education and language-related policies. The Catholic Center Party remained particularly well <b>entrenched</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Catholic strongholds of Bavaria and southern Baden, and in urban areas that held high populations of displaced rural workers seeking jobs in the heavy industry, and sought to protect the rights not only of Catholics, but other minorities, including the Poles, and the French minorities in the Alsatian lands. The May Laws of 1873 brought the appointment of priests, and their education, {{under the control of the}} state, resulting in the closure of many seminaries, and a shortage of priests. The Congregations Law of 1875 abolished religious orders, ended state subsidies to the Catholic Church, and removed religious protections from the Prussian constitution.|$|E
