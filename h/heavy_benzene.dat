40|$|The {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) modeling technique {{was applied to the}} estimation of maximum benzene concentration for the vapor space inside a large-scaled and high-level radioactive waste tank at Savannah River site (SRS). The objective of the work was to perform the calculations for the benzene mixing behavior in the vapor space of Tank 48 {{and its impact on the}} local concentration of benzene. The calculations were used to evaluate the degree to which purge air mixes with benzene evolving from the liquid surface and its ability to prevent an unacceptable concentration of benzene from forming. The analysis was focused on changing the tank operating conditions to establish internal recirculation and changing the benzene evolution rate from the liquid surface. The model used a three-dimensional momentum coupled with multi-species transport. The calculations included potential operating conditions for air inlet and exhaust flows, recirculation flow rate, and benzene evolution rate with prototypic tank geometry. The flow conditions are assumed to be fully turbulent since Reynolds numbers for typical operating conditions are in the range of 20, 000 to 70, 000 based on the inlet conditions of the air purge system. A standard two-equation turbulence model was used. The modeling results for the typical gas mixing problems available in the literature were compared and verified through comparisons with the test results. The benchmarking results showed that the predictions are in good agreement with the analytical solutions and literature data. Additional sensitivity calculations included a reduced benzene evolution rate, reduced air inlet and exhaust flow, and forced internal recirculation. The modeling results showed that the vapor space was fairly well mixed and that benzene concentrations were relatively low when forced recirculation and 72 cfm ventilation air through the tank boundary were imposed. For the same 72 cfm air inlet flow but without forced recirculation, the <b>heavier</b> <b>benzene</b> gas was stratified. The results demonstrated that benzene concentrations were relatively low for typical operating configurations and conditions.

40|$|The methanol-to-olefin (MTO) {{process is}} a very {{promising}} alternative for olefin production as waning oil reserves and an increasing demand for base chemicals arouse the use of alternative feedstocks. Methanol conversion occurs in acidic zeotype catalyst materials such as H-ZSM- 5 and H-SAPO- 34. The latter exhibits a particularly high selectivity towards light olefins due to its chabazite topology. [1] The generally accepted reaction mechanism for the MTO process {{is based on a}} hydrocarbon pool (HP) in which organic molecules (predominantly polymethylbenzenes) trapped within the anorganic zeolite framework co-catalyze the reactions. [2] To date, no decisive and detailed information exists on the dominant reaction mechanisms responsible for olefin production during methanol conversion in H-SAPO- 34.

40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} active {{substance}} on the interfacial tension of an alkali/inorganic salt/synthetic surfactants / crude oil system was studied, through {{the ways of}} contact time, infrared scan and mass analysis. This system consisted of <b>heavy</b> alkyl <b>benzene</b> sulfonate, sodium chloride, sodium hydrate and Daqing crude oil. The result of the experiment indicate that active substance diffusion from oil/aqueous interface to aqueous phase and finally the process of diffusion has a equilibrium in the system with the prolonging of the contact time. At the same time,the value of the minimum IFT {{and the value of}} equilibrium IFT rises with the prolonging of the contact time and has a linear relationship between IFT and t- 1 / 2 when IFT value approaching the minimum and after the minimum, the process is diffusion controlled. The oil and aqueous phase had been analysed by infrared scan and mass analysis, and then the phenomenon have been found that the content of active substance in the oil decreased and the content of active substance in the aqueous increased after alkali had a reaction with compound system. It is proved that the active substances in the oil play a very important role for reducing the IFT. Key words: contact time; diffusion action; alkali; interfacial tensio...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the experience gained from operating a dual fluidized bed system with oxygen carriers and biomass for more than 1000  h. The tests were carried out in the Chalmers boiler/gasifier loop (with inputs of 12  MWth and 2 – 4  MWth, respectively), which is 2 – 4 orders of magnitude larger than most existing CLC units. Coarse biomass particles (i. e., commercial wood pellets) were fed as fuel onto the surface of a mild fluidized bed. This limits significantly the contacts between the volatiles and the oxygen carrier particles, as the flotsam fuel tends to remain {{on the surface of the}} bed while the volatiles are released. The oxygen carrier materials tested were ilmenite and a manganese ore. The influences on biomass conversion of fluidization velocity, fuel feeding rate, and circulation rate of the bed material were investigated. Both bed materials efficiently transported oxygen between the reactors, achieving up to 60 % combustion of the gases released in the reactor at a relatively low temperature, i. e., 830  °C. The ilmenite outperformed the manganese ore under the conditions investigated. With oxygen carriers, the yield of hydrocarbons <b>heavier</b> than <b>benzene</b> was in the range of 10 – 11  g/N m 3, which was 70 % (w/w) lower than that obtained in a reference case with silica-sand as the bed material. The conversion of volatile species to CO 2 was limited by gas-solids mixing, which could be enhanced by altering the fluidization velocity. The circulation rate of the bed material and the fuel feeding rate were found to have important influences on the rate of char gasification. Given the relatively low operating temperature and the simple reactor design, relatively high conversion of biomass by the oxygen carriers was achieved. There is scope for further optimization of the operating conditions, to achieve higher conversion levels, which would enable the implementation of CLC of biomass on a large scale. © 2017 Elsevier Lt...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{conducted}} {{over the last}} decade have well established a direct relationship between deteriorating human health and diesel engine exhaust. Biodiesel has shown a lot of promise in terms of both its relatively higher combustion efficiency and lower harmful emissions. Biodiesel has the potential to replace a significant amount of the petroleum used to power diesel engines. The emissions from biodiesel are different than petroleum-based diesel and {{it is important to understand}} how they are different with respect to the levels emitted and the combustibility of the particulates. One of the major pollutants emitted from engine exhaust is particulate matter (PM). PM emitted from tailpipes contains a variety of toxic contaminants either embedded or adsorbed on its surface. This study provides a one to one comparison between PM emitted from a mid-size engine running on petroleum-based diesel versus biodiesel. The key physical and chemical parameters analyzed include metals, benzene soluble organic fraction, elemental and organic carbon fractions, particle morphology, particle number and size distribution. This is the first study of its kind where various aspects of the PM emitted from a biodiesel-operated engine have been extensively studied. The major results from the study showed that metals that come from engine wear are not present in biodiesel exhaust particulate due to its self lubricating properties. Samples collected of mineral diesel exhaust are relatively darker in color and stickier than biodiesel exhaust. Biodiesel and its blends gave more benzene soluble organic fraction (BSOF) in engine exhaust particulate matter than mineral diesel at all operating conditions. B 100 gave higher number of smaller particles in its exhaust than mineral diesel; comprehensively all size particles were also higher in case of B 100. Peak particle concentrations for biodiesel were shifted towards smaller size particles. As load increases, B 20 emission performance in terms of particle concentrations improves very rapidly and even surpasses mineral diesel emission performance. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images for B 100 and B 20 showed granular structure particulates with bigger grain size compared to mineral diesel. Among B 100, B 20 and mineral diesel, total particle accumulation was maximum for mineral diesel.

We searched the PubMed and SCOPUS databases to identify peer-reviewed published case-control studies investigating the association between GSTT 1 and/or GSTM 1 null genotypes and development of MDS. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q statistic and the I- 2 statistic. Odds ratios from individual studies were pooled using fixed and random effects models. Thirteen studies were considered eligible for the GSTT 1 meta-analysis (1471 cases, 1907 controls) and 10 were considered eligible for the GSTM 1 meta-analysis (1161 cases, 1668 controls). For the GSTT 1 polymorphism, there was moderate between study heterogeneity (p(Q) = 0. 01; I- 2 = 52. 3 %) and the null genotype {{was significantly associated with}} increased risk of MDS development, random effects OR = 1. 43 (95 % CI, 1. 09 - 1. 89); p = 0. 01.

40|$|The {{recovery}} of wastewater {{will be a}} fundamental action {{in the coming years}} to facilitate the sustainable development of the world's economies. A large portion of recoverable wastewater comes from petrochemical activities such as oil extraction and its subsequent refining processes. The most important characteristic of this water is its heavy contamination by soluble and insoluble hydrocarbons (as emulsioned hydrocarbons) and inorganic and heavy metal ions. Furthermore, the presence of refineries is directly linked to possible groundwater contamination that must be then remediated. In this context, adsorption technologies appear to be very promising for the remediation and {{recovery of}} "petrochemical" water. In this paper, we present a review of applied adsorption technologies and examine both the use of two different microporous materials, a natural zeolite called clinoptilolite and a polymeric chelating resin named Purolite® Resin S 910, for the removal of dissolved heavy metals, and the use of a mesoporous siliceous material for the uptake of hydrocarbons from wastewater. Batch experiments on the kinetics and equilibrium of adsorption were carried out on all the materials by using Pb 2 +, Cd 2 + and Ni 2 + as target <b>heavy</b> metals and <b>benzene</b> and toluene as target organic pollutants. The effect of ionic strength was also investigated. The batch tests indicated a good adsorption rate and a percentage of heavy metal and hydrocarbon removal that was always greater than 90 %. A new adsorption model was also developed to better describe the adsorption mechanism of heavy metals, while a model with a two-step mechanism was chosen for hydrocarbons. Increasing ionic strength appeared to decrease the adsorption performance of the microporous material and the presence of organic interfering contaminants. However, both materials seemed to maintain good adsorption capabilities. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Metals and {{metallic}} {{products are}} fundamental {{to a large}} number of modern industries and steel is certainly {{one of the most significant}} metallurgical products. Steel and steel castings as universal production material, that provided the grounds for the contemporary industrialization process,will have a continuously irreplaceable role in the future, regardless of the fact that nowadays steel materials are often replaced by other materials (ceramics, polymers, etc.), whenever it is technically required and cost-justified. The development of metallurgy and metallurgical processes is accompanied by pollution of the environment that directly or indirectly endangered the health of humans, certain animal and plant species, water resources systems, and soil. It also lead to increased erosion of material goodsand caused many other adverse social and economy-related effects. The integral steelworks concept has, for example, set off a significant increase in the number of emission sources and the increase of harmful substances concentration in the environment. The largest polluters have always been coking plants, iron ore agglomeration facilities, blast furnaces, steel mills, foundries and thermal energy plants. Numerous fundamental scientific research works have proven a series of adverse effects caused by uncontrolled emissions of harmful substances from these plants. Beside the considerable quantities of usual and well-known polluting substances such as sulfur and carbon oxides, fluorides,ammonia, <b>benzene,</b> <b>heavy</b> metals, phenols, cyanides, oil and grease, slag, used refractory material, metallic scrapings, sludge, dust, and scale, there are also relatively small pollutions with long-lasting effects that are hazardous even in their low concentrations and they rarely receivedue attention. This polluting substance group consists of persistent organic pollutions represented by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins(PCDDs), and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs). These compounds are the least explored of all known pollutions generated in the metallurgical processes, in terms of the impact of their emissions to the environment. The paper provides elementary toxicity data for these compounds and a survey of reference data on the currently completed listings of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans in the world and in Croatia, illustrating that the metallurgical process account for most of the total emission of these compounds into the environment. Based on the experience of the developed countries that are at the same time the largest iron and steel producers, we calculated an estimate of potential emissions of dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans from metallurgical processes in Croatia. The calculation took into account the coking processes, iron ore sintering processes, pig iron production, cast iron, openhearth steel and EAF steel production. The estimated total emission of dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans from metallurgical processes to the environment in the time period between 1990 and 2000 in Croatia was m = 3. 987 g I-TEQ and annual emission in the same period ranged from Q I-TEQ = 1. 284 g a - 1 in 1990 to Q I-TEQ = 0. 153 g a - 1 in 1995. Emissions of these compounds from metallurgical processes that were active in less recent past were also calculated and the values in the time period between 1960 and 2000 ranged from m = 2. 888 g I-TEQ in 1980 to m = 0. 153 g I-TEQ in 1995. Based on the data on the existing facilities for steel production in electric arc furnaces we estimated that annual emission of dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans could amount to Q I-TEQ ~ 0. 260 g a - 1, whereas the future emission of these compounds from the existing cast iron facilities could be Q I-TEQ ~ 0. 100 g a - 1. In the research follow-up for the impact of metallurgical processes on the overall emission of these compounds to the environment, it is required to measure their emissions from all active metallurgical processes. For the sake of better comprehension of emission flows of dibenzo-p-dioxins andpolychlorinated dibenzofurans from metallurgical processes it is necessary to determine the contents of these compounds in all kinds of waste generated in the observed metallurgical processes and to select technical solutions to improve each individual process and to reduce their emissions to the environment...|$|R
40|$|Benzene is a {{volatile}} organic air pollutant that is ubiquitous in the environment. It is frequently reported in urban airsheds, principally {{as a result}} of evaporative emissions from motor vehicles. Increasingly stringent fuel quality standards have resulted in lower mean benzene concentrations in many urban airsheds, however the concentrations reported indoors can be higher than those in urban airsheds. Mean indoor benzene concentrations can reach one order of magnitude higher than those reported in urban airsheds. Long term exposure to very high benzene concentrations can result in leukemia, however the health risks of long term non-industrial exposure in the general public are currently uncertain. An important part of determining the risks of non-industrial benzene exposure is to first determine the influence of various activities on 24 -hour personal benzene exposure. Previous research has identified commuting in a private motor vehicle and refuelling with low benzene fuel as statistically significant contributors to nonindustrial benzene exposure in the Northern Hemisphere, however none has quantified the increase in benzene exposure {{as a result of}} these activities over a 24 -hour period in the Mediterranean climate. The results of the 1987 TEAM study in the South Bay section of California reported that automobile exhaust was a significant contributor to non-industrial benzene exposure based on exhaled breath concentrations (p< 0. 05) and commuting in a private vehicle (p= 0. 0003) and refuelling (0. 05) were important contributors based on personal benzene exposure concentrations (Wallace et al., 1988). The aims of this thesis were to identify the roles and importance of selected activities in personal exposure to benzene, to determine the increase in 24 -hour personal benzene exposure attributable to these activities and quantify the risk posed by these activities in a Mediterranean climate. In particular, the aim of this thesis was to investigate whether commuting in a private motor vehicle and refuelling are significant contributors to non-industrial personal benzene exposure in a Mediterranean climate, or whether lifestyle and climate interact. This research was composed of a personal exposure study, a source monitoring study and a risk assessment. A cross-sectional personal exposure study was conducted for two reasons. Firstly, to quantify the mean personal benzene concentrations to which a representative sample of the general public of Perth was exposed as a result of their daily activities and behaviours. Secondly, to quantify the frequency of commuting by private motor vehicle and refuelling with low benzene fuel in Perth. Fifty participants were recruited for the personal exposure study, and asked to wear a monitor for 24 -hour period (including weekends) in summer and winter and record their activities and locations in a diary. Prior to the monitoring they were asked to complete a questionnaire seeking background information on their home, lifestyle and behaviours. The results of the research revealed that there was not a statistically significant difference between the personal benzene exposure concentrations in summer and winter. An analysis of the questionnaire and time activity diary data using a generalised linear mixed model revealed that the time spent commuting in a private motor vehicle (beta= 0. 281, p< 0. 0001) and refuelling with low benzene fuel (beta = 0. 194, p= 0. 033) were statistically significant contributors to non-industrial benzene exposure. Each hour spent commuting resulted in a mean increase in 24 -hour personal exposure of 0. 74 mcg- 3 (beta= 0. 729 mcg m- 3, p< 0. 0001). The mean increase in exposure per hour of commuting in a private motor vehicle was larger in winter (beta= 0. 8 mcg m- 3, p= 0. 008) than summer (beta= 0. 67 mcg m- 3, p= 0. 004). Refuelling increased personal exposure by 1. 50 mcg m- 3 (1. 49, p< 0. 0001) in each 24 -period when refuelling was reported. Benzene source monitoring was conducted at selected locations in Perth for two reasons. Firstly, data quantifying non-industrial personal benzene exposure during refuelling and commuting in a private vehicle in Perth was needed, and secondly, to make an assessment of risk attributable to these activities. Benzene source measurements were conducted in two carparks in the Central Business District (CBD), in the vicinity of the northbound and southbound lanes of the Kwinana Freeway, and at a petrol station. The 7 - day arithmetic mean benzene concentrations in the carparks were 4. 49 mcg m- 3 and 1. 23 mcg m- 3. The 7 -day mean benzene concentrations northbound on the Kwinana Freeway was 2. 78 mcg m- 3, and the mean benzene concentration southbound was 2. 57 mcg m- 3. Benzene emissions in the carpark and on the Kwinana Freeway were measured during vehicle idling, which is representative of vehicle speed during <b>heavy</b> vehicle traffic. <b>Benzene</b> emissions at the petrol station were monitored in the vicinity of the petrol bowser, which is representative of emissions during refuelling. The 24 -hour mean benzene concentration at the petrol station bowser was 38. 15 mcg m- 3. The results of this research revealed that refuelling and commuting in a private vehicle are the most significant contributors to non-industrial benzene exposure in Perth, and that the contribution of these two activities in Perth is far greater than in previous published research, on the basis of the results obtained from the generalised linear model. The results of this research quantified the increase in non-industrial benzene exposure from refuelling and commuting in a private motor vehicle in a Mediterranean climate for the first time, and quantified the lifetime excess cancer risk attributable to these activities in a Mediterranean climate for the first time. The lifetime excess cancer unit risks of these two activities in a Mediterranean climate were 7. 4 x 10 - 5 or 7. 4 per 100000 population for commuting and 15. 03 x 10 - 4 or 15 per 10000 for refuelling...|$|R
