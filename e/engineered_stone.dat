5000|$|<b>Engineered</b> <b>stones</b> are {{the latest}} {{development}} of artificial stones, it was invented in the early 1980s and have since been continuously developed by the Italian company Breton S.P.A.'s late founder Marcello Toncelli. [...] <b>Engineered</b> <b>stones</b> are a mix of marble powder, resin, and pigment cast using vacuum oscillation to form blocks. Slabs are then produced by cutting, grinding, and polishing. Some factories have developed a special, low-viscosity, high-strength polyester resin to improve hardness, strength, and gloss and to reduce water absorption.|$|R

50|$|In 1845 the British {{government}} {{agreed that}} a new Government House in Sydney had become a necessity, and the royal architect, Edward Blore, was instructed to draw up plans. Construction commenced in 1837 and was supervised by colonial architect Mortimer Lewis and Colonel Barney of the Royal <b>Engineers.</b> <b>Stone,</b> cedar, and marble for the construction were obtained from various areas of New South Wales. A ball in honour of the birthday of Queen Victoria {{was held in the}} new building in 1843, although construction was not complete. The first resident, Governor George Gipps, did not move in until 1845.|$|R
5000|$|Breton was {{established}} in 1963 in Castello di Godego, Italy, by Marcello Toncelli, who started developing new technologies and manufacturing industrial plants for producing <b>engineered</b> <b>stone.</b> Marcello Toncelli invented the Bretonstone technology, also known as vibrocompression under vacuum, a patented technology [...] which is used today by most <b>engineered</b> <b>stone</b> manufacturers.Around the mid 1990s the company decided to enter also into the machine tool market, manufacturing machining centres for the mechanical industry.|$|E
50|$|The {{material}} is sometimes damaged by direct application of heat. Quartz <b>engineered</b> <b>stone</b> is less heat resistant than other stone surfaces including most granite, marble and limestone; {{but is not}} affected by temperatures lower than 150 °C (300 °F). Quartz <b>engineered</b> <b>stone</b> can be damaged by sudden temperature changes. Manufacturers recommend that hot pots and pans never be placed directly on the surface, and that a hot pad or trivet is used under portable cooking units.|$|E
50|$|<b>Engineered</b> <b>stone</b> is less porous, more flexible, {{and harder}} than {{many types of}} natural stone. Less porous {{varieties}} are more resistant to mould and mildew than most natural stone types. Since it has a uniform internal structure, {{it does not have}} hidden cracks or flaws that may exist in natural stone. Its polyester resin binding agents allow some flexibility, preventing cracking under flexural pressure. But, the binding agents often continue to harden, leading to a loss of flexural strength over time. The polyester resins are not completely UV stable and <b>engineered</b> <b>stone</b> should not be used in outdoor applications. Continuous exposure to UV can cause discoloration of the stone, and breakdown of the resin binder.|$|E

5000|$|Breton S.P.A., {{a privately}} held company of Treviso, Italy, is the {{dominant}} supplier of equipment for making <b>engineered</b> <b>stone.</b> A mixture of approximately 93% stone aggregates and 7% polyester resin by weight (66% quartz and 34% resin by volume) is pressed into slabs (or larger blocks) using Breton's [...] "vibrocompression vacuum process".|$|E

40|$|Over 35 {{samples of}} {{decorative}} stone, imported into the United States {{for use as}} countertops and mantels, were measured for the emission of radon using electrets and continuous radon monitors. The 14 <b>engineered</b> <b>stones</b> emitted little or no measurable radon (≤ 2 pCi/lb; < 0. 2 Bq/kg), while the natural stones emitted up to 42 pCi/lb (3. 4 Bq/kg). Pieces of a granite countertop, removed from a local home, emitted an average 170 pCi/lb (14 Bq/kg) of radon. It is estimated that {{in most cases the}} contribution of the decorative stone to the indoor radon concentration will be < 1 pCi/L, but may exceed 4 pCi/L in rare cases...|$|R

50|$|Basically the vibro-compression vacuum technology, used by Bretonstone system, {{consists}} of blending the natural aggregate of stone with a polymer mix (usually unsaturated polyester resin), taking away {{air with a}} vacuum, and catalyzing the molded product whilst vibrating and applying pressure to this mix. Then the mixture is heated, and the output is a slab of non-porous and quite stable <b>engineered</b> <b>stone.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Engineered</b> <b>stone</b> (US name) is also {{commonly}} referred to as agglomerate or agglomerated stone, the last term being that recognised by European Standards (EN 14618), although to add to the terminological confusion, this standard also includes materials manufactured with a cementitious binder. The quartz version (which end consumers {{are much more likely to}} directly deal with) is commonly known as 'quartz surface' or just 'quartz'.|$|E
50|$|As {{with any}} silica-containing stone, {{silicosis}} {{may result from}} breathing dust produced when cutting or processing <b>engineered</b> <b>stone</b> made with quartz. The risk of inhaling quartz dust can be mitigated by taking appropriate safety precautions. Risk of silicosis is high when little or no safety precautions or protective equipment are used. This may occur in small shops or in countries where the industry is not regulated or monitored.|$|E

5000|$|Italy was {{the most}} {{dominant}} country in the supply of <b>engineered</b> <b>stone</b> products from the 1980s until the early 2000s, especially in engineered marble. The growth of the Chinese economy has changed the market drastically as China now has the most producers and largest overall quantity produced. There {{are estimated to be}} more than 100 <b>engineered</b> <b>stone</b> suppliers in China alone. India also has roughly 40 slab producing units as of December 2012. The original companies that operate Breton machines such as the Italian companies, Quarrella, Santa Maghretta and the Taiwanese company Romastone remain the most recognizable brands for marble. The private Spanish company Cosentino brand Silestone and the public Israeli company Caesarstone are the most recognizable brands for quartz also Totem Quartz, the Iranian company which has a huge market in middle east and Central Asia. China is now probably the largest market for engineered marble due to new construction projects, while engineered quartz is primarily sold in North America and Europe as high end residential kitchen counter tops.|$|E
50|$|Depending on the color, IceStone is 68%-75% {{recycled}} glass, 15-20% white Portland cement, {{and small}} percentages of pigments and proprietary ingredients. The glass used is 100% recycled. The surface contains no petrochemicals, resins, or VOCs; IceStone's marketing material distinguishes its product from <b>engineered</b> <b>stone</b> countertops like quartz surfaces, which are typically made with synthetic resins. According to the Care & Maintenance guidelines on IceStone's website, {{the surface is}} semi-porous due to its cement content and requires regular application of a penetrating sealer.|$|E
