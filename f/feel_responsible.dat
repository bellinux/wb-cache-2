5|$|Frustrated that Gee {{refuses to}} {{consider}} the possibility of a police shooting, Pembleton assures him he will get a confession out of Staley, whether he did it or not. Pembleton starts the interrogation calm and polite, but gradually becomes angrier, frightening Staley. Pembleton makes him <b>feel</b> <b>responsible</b> for allowing Cox to be at the crackhouse, and uses that guilt to break Staley down and confess, even though he is obviously innocent. Pembleton gives the confession to Gee, who is conflicted, especially when Pembleton compares it to past police practices of white detectives getting confessions from black suspects no matter what the cost. Ultimately, Gee tears up the confession and instead visits Staley at jail. Staley admits to Gee that Lt. Jimmy Tyron (Michael S. Kennedy) shot Cox in the back without warning while Cox was running away. Pembleton and Bayliss arrest Tyron at his home, where they confiscate a gun and bullets that appear to match those used against Cox. The arrest deeply saddens Howard, who had previously had an affair with Tyron. The affair ended because Tyron was married with children, but Howard continues to harbor romantic feelings for him.|$|E

25|$|Women {{preferred}} canal {{water to}} groundwater because canal water was softer {{and was not}} brackish. The surroundings of standpipes were dirty and the residents did not <b>feel</b> <b>responsible</b> to maintain them, seeing this as a responsibility of the government. Shallow wells were contaminated. There was no sewerage and no system to dispose greywater. Household latrines were used primarily by women. Men used sanitary facilities at mosques or defecated in canals. Children defecated openly in the streets or fields. Emptying of latrines was done by donkey carts or trucks which empty their load into canals. As a result of conditions like these infant mortality remained high despite the government's provision of water through standpipes.|$|E

25|$|Student {{involvement}} {{in the classroom is}} a key part of OBE. Students are expected to do their own learning, so that they gain a full understanding of the material. Increased student involvement allows students to <b>feel</b> <b>responsible</b> for their own learning, and they should learn more through this individual learning. Other aspects of involvement are parental and community, through developing curriculum, or making changes to it. OBE outcomes are meant to be decided upon within a school system, or at a local level. Parents and community members are asked to give input in order to uphold the standards of education within a community and to ensure that students will be prepared for life after school.|$|E
25|$|The season {{opens with}} the Conner women confronting {{the issue of}} {{pregnancy}}: Roseanne takes a pregnancy test that turns up negative. Roseanne takes on a job as waitress in the restaurant at Rodbell's Department Store, where she meets Leon (Martin Mull) and Bonnie (Bonnie Sheridan). Jackie gets injured on the job, which results in her breaking up with her boyfriend Gary. Becky begins dating Mark Healy (Glenn Quinn); when her parents forbid her to see him, she temporarily moves in with Jackie. Dan is floored to learn his father Ed and Crystal plan to marry; Crystal is pregnant with Ed's baby. Roseanne locks horns with snooty new neighbor Kathy (Meagen Fay). Nana Mary (Shelley Winters) makes her first appearance at a family barbecue. In the season finale, Ziggy reappears, proposing to open a motorcycle repair shop with Dan and Roseanne. While {{they are in the}} process of getting the business off the ground, Ziggy decides to leave because he doesn't want to <b>feel</b> <b>responsible</b> if the business fails. However, he leaves enough money for Dan to open it by himself. We never hear about him again.|$|E

If that's where the subject is taking you, you have to follow. At least in the imagination. I'm not sure I want to get down there to live. I'll take a walk occasionally, and have a drink with the devil, but I'm not moving in with him." [...] The Edge said that the song's defence in the trial was [...] "very heavy", stating [...] "Should any artist hold back from putting out {{something}} because he's afraid of what somebody else might do {{as a result of his}} work? I would hate to see censorship come in, whether from the government or, from my point of view, personal." ...|$|E

500|$|Wollstonecraft's {{ideas of}} virtue {{revolved}} around the family, distinguishing her from other republicans such as Francis Hutcheson and William Godwin. For Wollstonecraft, virtue begins in the home: private virtues are the foundation for public virtues. Inspired by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's depictions of the ideal family and the republican Swiss canton, she draws a picture of idyllic family life in a small country village. [...] One scholar describes her plan this way: [...] "vast estates would be divided into small farms, cottagers {{would be allowed to}} make enclosures from the commons and, instead of alms being given to the poor, they would be given the means to independence and self-advancement." [...] Individuals would learn and practice virtue in the home, virtue that would not only make them self-sufficient, but also prompt them to <b>feel</b> <b>responsible</b> for the citizens of their society.|$|E
500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} publication, Benchley began to <b>feel</b> <b>responsible</b> for the negative attitudes against sharks that his novel engendered. He became an ardent ocean conservationist. In an article for the National Geographic published in 2000, Benchley writes [...] "considering the knowledge accumulated about sharks in the last 25 years, I couldn't possibly write Jaws today... not in good conscience anyway. Back then, it was generally accepted that great whites were anthropophagus (they ate people) by choice. Now we know that almost every attack on a human is an accident: The shark mistakes the human for its normal prey." [...] Upon his death in 2006, Benchley's widow Wendy declared the author [...] "kept telling people the book was fiction", and comparing Jaws to The Godfather, [...] "he took no more responsibility for the fear of sharks than Mario Puzo took responsibility for the Mafia." ...|$|E
500|$|Villeneuve's arrival was {{prompted}} by Ferrari driver Niki Lauda quitting the team at the penultimate race of the 1977 season, the Canadian Grand Prix at Mosport Park near Toronto, having already clinched his second championship with the Italian team. Villeneuve retired from his home race after sliding off the track on another competitor's oil. He also raced in the last race of that season, the Japanese Grand Prix at the Fuji Speedway near Tokyo but retired on lap five {{when he tried to}} outbrake the Tyrrell P34 of Ronnie Peterson. The pair banged wheels causing Villeneuve's Ferrari to become airborne. It landed on a group of spectators watching the race from a prohibited area, killing one spectator and a race marshal and injuring ten people. After an investigation into the incident no blame was apportioned and, although he was [...] "terribly sad" [...] at the deaths, Villeneuve did not <b>feel</b> <b>responsible</b> for them.|$|E

500|$|Many reviewers {{found the}} combat system was more {{responsive}} {{than in previous}} games, particularly praising {{the addition of the}} cover system. Justin Calvert of GameSpot wrote that the cover system makes the game's combat a [...] "huge improvement" [...] over previous games. Reiner of Game Informer agreed, writing that the targeting system makes players <b>feel</b> <b>responsible</b> for all deaths. IGN's Goldstein praised the fluidity of the cover system, and felt that the auto aim mechanic is a [...] "great help in larger battles". GamesRadar's Walter wrote that the cover system has [...] "paved the way to a new style of mission". David McComb of Empire called the combat [...] "sharp and instinctive", and Hicks of Official Xbox Magazine felt that the cover system allows players to execute an attack plan. In addition to the combat system, most reviewers noted the vehicle handling was more realistic than in previous games. Robinson of Computer and Video Games felt that the vehicle handling echoed realism, while Hicks of Official Xbox Magazine called the vehicle selection [...] "excellent". Costantino of Game Revolution praised the improvement of the game's mechanics, particularly the physics engine's advanced vehicle and character animations.|$|E
2500|$|Usage {{of moral}} suasion in {{environment}} regulation consists in making polluters <b>feel</b> <b>responsible</b> for the negative externalities that they cause.

[...] Furthermore, the administrative costs of using moral suasion to deal with environmental problems is very low.|$|E

2500|$|But the French {{were not}} {{prepared}} to be brushed off quite so easily. [...] As so often during the era of European colonial expansion, religious persecution created a reason for intervention. [...] French missionaries had been active in Vietnam since the 17th century, and {{by the middle of}} the 19th century there were perhaps 300,000 Roman Catholic converts in Annam and Tonkin. [...] Most of their bishops and priests were either French or Spanish. [...] Most Vietnamese disliked and suspected this sizeable Christian community and its foreign leaders. [...] The French, conversely, began to <b>feel</b> <b>responsible</b> for their safety. [...] Harassment of the Christians eventually provided France with a respectable pretext for attacking Vietnam. [...] The tension built up gradually. [...] During the 1840s, persecution or harassment of Catholic missionaries in Vietnam by the Vietnamese emperors Minh Mạng and Thiệu Trị evoked only sporadic and unofficial French reprisals. [...] The decisive step towards the establishment of a French colonial empire in Indochina was not taken until 1858.|$|E
2500|$|On January 23, Clinton {{finally gave}} {{more than five}} hours of {{testimony}} on the Benghazi matter before hearings of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

I stood next to President Obama as the Marines carried those flag-draped caskets off the plane at Andrews. I put my arms around the mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, sons and daughters." [...] She again accepted formal responsibility for the departmental security lapses that led to the attack and deaths, but in explanation did not accept personal blame for them. She said, [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>responsible</b> for the nearly 70,000 people who work for the State Department. But the specific security requests pertaining to Benghazi, you know, were handled by the security professionals in the department. I didn't see those requests. They didn't come to me. I didn't approve them. I didn't deny them." [...] She did acknowledge that she had supported keeping the Benghazi consulate open after an earlier debate about its deteriorating security, but said she had assumed the security personnel involved would address any issues with it.|$|E
