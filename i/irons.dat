40|$|Remarkable {{progress}} was recently {{achieved in the}} studies on molecular regulators of <b>iron</b> metabolism. Among the main regulators, storage <b>iron,</b> <b>iron</b> absorption, erythropoiesis and hepcidin interact in keeping <b>iron</b> homeostasis. Diseases with gene-mutations resulting in <b>iron</b> overload, <b>iron</b> deficiency, and local <b>iron</b> deposition have been introduced {{in relation to the}} regulators of storage <b>iron</b> metabolism. On the other hand, the research on storage <b>iron</b> metabolism has not advanced since the pioneering research by Shoden in 1953. However, we recently developed a new method for determining ferritin <b>iron</b> and hemosiderin <b>iron</b> by computer-assisted serum ferritin kinetics. Serum ferritin increase or decrease curves were measured in patients with normal storage <b>iron</b> levels (chronic hepatitis C and <b>iron</b> deficiency anemia treated by intra-venous <b>iron</b> injection), and <b>iron</b> overload (hereditary hemochromatosis and transfusion dependent anemia). We thereby confirmed the existence of two <b>iron</b> pathways where <b>iron</b> flows followed the numbered order (1) labile <b>iron,</b> (2) ferritin and (3) hemosiderin in <b>iron</b> deposition and mobilization among many previously proposed but mostly unproven routes. We also demonstrated the increasing and decreasing phases of ferritin <b>iron</b> and hemosiderin <b>iron</b> in <b>iron</b> deposition and mobilization. The author first demonstrated here the change in proportion between pre-existing ferritin <b>iron</b> and new ferritin <b>iron</b> synthesized by removing <b>iron</b> from hemosiderin in the course of <b>iron</b> removal.

40|$|Background. Evidence of iron-mediated {{oxidative}} stress, neutrophil dysfunction {{and enhanced}} bacterial growth after intravenous (IV) <b>iron</b> {{administration has been}} ascribed to a labile or bioactive <b>iron</b> fraction present in all IV <b>iron</b> agents. Methods. To quantify and compare {{the size of the}} labile fraction in several classes of IV <b>iron</b> agents, we examined <b>iron</b> donation to transferrin (Tf) in vitro. We added dilutions of ferric gluconate, <b>iron</b> sucrose and each of two <b>iron</b> dextran preparations to serum in vitro, passed the resulting samples through alumina columns to remove <b>iron</b> agent and free organic <b>iron,</b> and measured Tf-bound <b>iron</b> in the resulting eluates. Comparing results to serum samples without added <b>iron,</b> we calculated delta Tf-bound <b>iron</b> for each agent at each concentration. Finally, we compared delta Tf-bound <b>iron</b> to the concentration of added agent and calculated the percent <b>iron</b> donation to Tf. Results. We found that Tf-bound <b>iron</b> increased with added <b>iron</b> concentration for each agent: delta Tf-bound <b>iron</b> was directly related to the concentration and type of <b>iron</b> agent (P< 0. 001). Mean percent <b>iron</b> donation to Tf ranged from 2. 5 to 5. 8 % with the following progression: <b>iron</b> dextran-Dexferrum< <b>iron</b> dextran-INFeD<iron sucrose<ferric gluconate. Pairwise differences between agents for percent <b>iron</b> donation were statistically significant (P< 0. 05) only between ferric gluconate and both <b>iron</b> dextran agents, and between <b>iron</b> sucrose and <b>iron</b> dextran-Dexferrum. Conclusions. Approximately 2 – 6 % of total <b>iron</b> in commonly used IV <b>iron</b> compounds is available for in vitro <b>iron</b> donation to Tf.

40|$|We {{attempted}} {{to clarify the}} mechanism of the storage <b>iron</b> metabolism. A new program of serum ferritin kinetics was applied for studying the increasing and decreasing phases of ferritin and hemosiderin <b>iron</b> in <b>iron</b> addition and removal in patients with a normal level of <b>iron</b> stores or <b>iron</b> overload. The change of ferritin <b>iron</b> in response to <b>iron</b> addition and removal was rapid in the initial stage, but it was slow later. In contrast, the change of hemosiderin <b>iron</b> was slow in the initial stage, but it became rapid later. These changes of ferritin and hemosiderin <b>iron</b> suggest that the turnover of ferritin <b>iron</b> is preferential to that of hemosiderin <b>iron,</b> and that the initially existed ferritin <b>iron</b> is gradually replaced by the ferritin <b>iron</b> recovered by taking <b>iron</b> from hemosiderin in <b>iron</b> mobilization. The crossing of the increasing curves of ferritin and hemosiderin <b>iron</b> in <b>iron</b> addition indicates a switching of the principal storage <b>iron</b> from ferritin to hemosiderin. The crossing point shifted toward a higher storage <b>iron</b> level in the increase of <b>iron</b> deposition. <b>Iron</b> storing capacity can be increased {{not only by the}} transformation of ferritin into hemosiderin, but also by the expansion of cell space as seen by hepatomegaly in hereditary hemochromatosis. The amounts of hemosiderin <b>iron</b> exceeded ferritin <b>iron</b> in all 10 patients with chronic hepatitis C even though they had normal storage <b>iron</b> levels.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIFerritin <b>iron</b> {{from food}} is readily {{bioavailable}} to humans {{and has the}} potential for treating <b>iron</b> deficiency. Whether ferritin <b>iron</b> absorption is mechanistically different from <b>iron</b> absorption from small <b>iron</b> complexes/salts remains controversial. Here, we studied <b>iron</b> absorption (RBC Fe- 59) from radiolabeled ferritin <b>iron</b> (0. 5 mg) in healthy women with or without non-ferritin <b>iron</b> competitors, ferrous sulfate, or hemoglobin. A 9 -fold excess of non-ferritin <b>iron</b> competitor had no significant effect on ferritin <b>iron</b> absorption. Larger amounts of <b>iron</b> (50 mg and a 99 -fold excess of either competitor) inhibited <b>iron</b> absorption. To measure transport rates of <b>iron</b> that was absorbed inside ferritin, rat intestinal segments ex vivo were perfused with radiolabeled ferritin and compared to perfusion with ferric nitrilotriacetic (Fe-NTA), a well-studied form of chelated <b>iron.</b> Intestinal transport of <b>iron</b> absorbed inside exogenous ferritin was 14. 8 % of the rate measured for <b>iron</b> absorbed from chelated <b>iron.</b> In the steady state, endogenous enterocyte ferritin contained > 90 % of the <b>iron</b> absorbed from Fe-NTA or ferritin. We found that ferritin is a slow release source of <b>iron,</b> readily available to humans or animals, based on RBC <b>iron</b> incorporation.
