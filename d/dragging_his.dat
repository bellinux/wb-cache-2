5|$|In the {{particular}} {{version of the}} experiment shown here, Hoek used a prism P to disperse light from a slit into a spectrum which passed through a collimator C before entering the apparatus. With the apparatus oriented parallel to the hypothetical aether wind, Hoek expected the light in one circuit to be retarded 7/600mm {{with respect to the}} other. Where this retardation represented an integral number of wavelengths, he expected to see constructive interference; where this retardation represented a half-integral number of wavelengths, he expected to see destructive interference. In the absence of <b>dragging,</b> <b>his</b> expectation was for the observed spectrum to be continuous with the apparatus oriented transversely to the aether wind, and to be banded with the apparatus oriented parallel to the aether wind. His actual experimental results were completely negative.|$|E
5|$|Despite Bowser's demise in {{the first}} level, this does not stop Bowser Jr. from running through the {{remaining}} worlds with Peach in tow, forcing Mario to chase after him before reaching Bowser's castle in world 8. There, Bowser Jr. revives his father's skeleton, creating Dry Bowser, but Mario once again defeats Bowser by dropping him into a deep pit. In the final battle, Bowser Jr. flees once more across a lava chasm to a larger castle, where he throws his father's bones into a cauldron and revives Bowser in his original form. They attack Mario in tandem, but Mario drops the pair into the pit below. In the game's final sequence, Mario rescues Peach, who kisses him on the cheek. Over the end credits, Bowser Jr. is seen <b>dragging</b> <b>his</b> unconscious father across the floor. He looks at the screen, and growls, breaking the fourth wall.|$|E
5|$|Emmett's {{departure}} brought Lindwall's tormentor Edrich to the crease. Bradman advised his speedster not to bowl any bouncers at Edrich, fearing {{such actions}} would {{be interpreted as}} retaliation and provoke a negative media and crowd reaction. After not bowling in the first innings, Miller came on and immediately broke through Washbrook's defences, only to see the ball graze the stumps without dislodging the bails. Washbrook then drove Lindwall for four before Miller bounced him in the next over. After two Miller outswingers had evaded the outside edge of Washbrook, the batsman appeared unsettled. One bouncer was hit over square leg in an uncontrolled manner for a four, and another flew in the air, narrowly evading Loxton at fine leg. Lindwall followed Miller's lead towards Washbrook and was no balled by umpire Davies for <b>dragging</b> <b>his</b> foot beyond the line. Following a disagreement, Davies threw Lindwall his jumper, but the matter faded away and the bowler was not no balled again after discussing the matter with Bradman.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after 20:00, the {{trailing}} Swiftsure and Alexander, joined by Leander, attacked the French centre, causing severe damage to Franklin and killing Admiral Brueys on his quarterdeck with a cannon shot. At 21:00, a {{fire broke out}} in Orients stern, the blaze spread further by volleys from Swiftsure that also defeated efforts to extinguish it. The flames spread rapidly, racing up the masts and across the decks until the entire flagship was a blazing wreck. At 22:00, the vast magazines detonated, tearing the ship apart and hurling burning wreckage onto the neighbouring vessels. For ten minutes not a shot was fired, as the nearest ships battled to extinguish fires and the further ones paused in shock. The first ship to recommence hostilities was Franklin, but Admiral Blanquet's heavily outnumbered flagship was forced to surrender by 24:00. Tonnant, the only French ship still engaged, fought on against Majestic until 03:00, when the mortally wounded Captain Aristide Aubert Du Petit Thouars succeeded in <b>dragging</b> <b>his</b> ship to the temporary safety of the rear division under Rear-Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of England's second innings, Washbrook took a single from Lindwall, who {{promptly}} removed Emmett for a duck. Lindwall pitched an outswinger on the line of off stump and Emmett edged it to wicket-keeper Tallon, who dived and took it in his right hand. This brought Lindwall’s tormentor Edrich to the crease. Bradman advised Lindwall not to bounce Edrich, fearing this would be interpreted as retaliation and generate negative media attention. However, Miller retaliated with four consecutive bouncers, angering the crowd. He struck Edrich on the body before Bradman and ordered him to stop; the Australian captain apologised to Edrich for the hostile bowling. Lindwall bounced Washbrook and was no balled by umpire Dai Davies for <b>dragging</b> <b>his</b> foot beyond the line. After a disagreement, Davies threw Lindwall his jumper, but the tension faded away and the paceman was not no balled again after discussing the matter with Bradman. Lindwall bounced Washbrook again {{and this time the}} England opener went for the hook shot. The ball flew off the top edge in the air, straight towards Hassett at fine leg, who dropped the catch after juggling three times. Having received a reprieve on 21, Washbrook settled down and reached 50 in only 70 minutes with England at 1/80.|$|E
25|$|On the Giants {{first drive}} {{of the second}} quarter, on 3rd-and-7, {{receiver}} Amani Toomer caught in a deep pass from Manning along the left sideline while <b>dragging</b> <b>his</b> feet in-bounds for a 38-yard gain, moving {{the ball to the}} Patriots' 19. But three plays later, Manning threw a pass that bounced out of the arms of rookie receiver Steve Smith and into the hands of cornerback Ellis Hobbs for an interception.|$|E

Dionysius responded by building a wooden plank road on the isthmus north of Motya and <b>dragging</b> <b>his</b> triremes to the open sea. Outsmarted, Himilco withdrew his fleet. Dionysius then commenced his assault on Motya, which fell despite stubborn resistance. Dionysius sacked the city, garrisoned the ruins and, keeping Segesta and Entella under siege, returned to Syracuse with most of his fleet and army for the winter. His brother Leptines of Syracuse kept 120 ships at Eryx, including at least thirty quinqueremes.|$|E

His father was surrounded by the Indians who wounded him with arrows and lances. Inside the house, Luke, who was a little boy at that time, helped the elder Short by <b>dragging</b> <b>his</b> large rifle to his brother, who then ran and handed it to his father. At the age of 13, Luke was said to have carved the face of a bully when he was still schooling, which was a reason why he and his father moved to Forth Worth, Texas.|$|E
25|$|Argentina's Gonzalo Higuaín {{missed a}} good {{opportunity}} in the first half, <b>dragging</b> <b>his</b> shot wide after being put through on goal by a misjudged header from Toni Kroos. He had a goal disallowed later in the first half, when he was ruled offside after tapping in a cross by Ezequiel Lavezzi from the right wing. Lionel Messi wasted a chance {{early in the second}} half, firing wide of the German goal from inside the penalty area after receiving a through pass. In extra time, Rodrigo Palacio's lob over Manuel Neuer went just wide after the forward received a cross, missed by Mats Hummels, in the German penalty area. Germany had the closest chance when Benedikt Höwedes' header hit the post after a corner.|$|E

25|$|Authorities rated Rîmaru's {{modus operandi}} as ferocious and cruel, {{based on his}} {{propensity}} for cutting off clothes, biting off flesh, <b>dragging</b> <b>his</b> victims, and hacking away at them with his weapons, also raping them while they were unconscious. Rîmaru was judged to be aggressive, impulsive and sadistic. He showed signs of vampirism; for instance, he poked several holes into the flesh of Florica Marcu, who later related how he sucked blood out of them. Cannibalism was also present; he would bite women's vaginas, pubic areas and breasts, and the missing pieces of flesh were no longer found at the crime scenes. Additionally, he had necrophiliac tendencies, continuing his rapes after his victims had died and also beating and stabbing their corpses.|$|E
25|$|Many of the European comics {{based on}} the Disney Universe have created {{their own version of}} Scrooge McDuck, usually {{involving}} him in slapstick adventures. This is particularly true of the Italian comics which were very popular in the 1960s-1980s in most parts of Western continental Europe. In these, Scrooge is mainly an anti-hero <b>dragging</b> <b>his</b> long-suffering nephews into treasure hunts and shady business deals. Donald is a reluctant participant in these travels, only agreeing to go along when his uncle reminds him of the debts and back-rent Donald owes him, threatens him with a sword or blunderbuss, or offers a share of the loot. When he promises Donald a share of the treasure, Scrooge will add a little loophole in the terms which may seem obscure at first but which he brings {{up at the end of}} the adventure to deny Donald his share, keeping the whole for himself. After Donald risks life and limb – something which Scrooge shows little concern for – he tends to end up with nothing.|$|E
500|$|During the match, Halcombe {{was twice}} no-balled by umpire A. J. Buttsworth {{on the first}} day, and then ten times in {{succession}} by umpire Walter Lonergan. This did not occur when Halcombe was switched to the opposite end. The match at Hobart's TCA ground had seen Western Australia bat first and compile 248 before being dismissed late on the first day, with Halcombe scoring three. After the change of innings, Tasmanian openers Jim [...] "Snowy" [...] Atkinson and Alf Rushforth started their innings at 17:10 local time with Rushworth taking strike to Halcombe, who ran in from the pavilion end. Buttsworth called Halcombe from square leg on the third ball. Halcombe was bowling at such a pace that the wicket-keeper and slips were standing about 20 metres behind the stumps. Lonergan, standing at the bowler's end, also no-balled Halcombe for <b>dragging</b> <b>his</b> back foot over the crease. On the eighth ball, Buttsworth called Halcombe for another throw. After Alex Webster bowled an over from the other end, Halcombe continued from the pavilion end and was greeted with applause from the crowd. Halcombe sent down another two overs without incident.|$|E

500|$|Stirling was {{concerned}} by {{the proximity of the}} coast and hailed Pique with orders to anchor before it grounded, but Milne did not hear the order correctly and instead increased sail, lurching ahead of Jason and straight onto a sandbank close to La Tranche-sur-Mer on the Vendée coast. Seine too had struck the shore a little distance ahead, and Stirling was unable to arrest Jasons momentum before his ship too became stuck, lying between Pique and Seine. The French ship had been badly damaged in the crash, all three masts collapsing overboard at impact, but actually lay in a stronger position: Jason blocked Piques arc of fire and Stirling's ship had swung with the rising tide, leaving its stern exposed. Bigot took advantage of this position to fire several raking broadsides into Jason, during which Stirling was wounded and command passed to Lieutenant Charles Inglis. Inglis responded to the fire by cutting stern gunports to fire chase guns at Seine, and Milne succeeded in <b>dragging</b> <b>his</b> frigate around through the novel expedient of ordering his men to run towards the bows carrying round shot. This sudden shift in weight gently rotated the grounded ship to face Seine and Milne could direct four of his 12-pounder long guns at the French ship. [...] Under fire and with Mermaid finally approaching, Bigot determined that further resistance was hopeless and struck his colours.|$|E
500|$|Dean-Charles Chapman, who portrayed King Tommen Baratheon, {{spoke about}} filming his death scene, saying [...] "I was jumping onto a crash mat. Height-wise, I think if I was {{standing}} on the floor, it was up to my chest. But the crash mat was pretty thick. I must have done that about 50 times. My face was pretty bruised up. My face took it a little bit." [...] Eugene Simon, who portrayed Lancel Lannister, also spoke about his death scene revealing about his discussions with Sapochnik, [...] "the note was when Lancel was <b>dragging</b> <b>his</b> body, {{there was a sense of}} someone who is trying to put aside their pain of being stabbed and being paralyzed as much as possible in order to try to defend what little hope there is left of trying to save the sept and also to save their life. It really only comes down to the very last few nanoseconds of footage that you realize the cause is lost." [...] Simon also stated about the filming of Jonathan Pryce's, who portrays the High Sparrow, final scene, [...] "we had a very big nice round of applause when that took place. I remember that scene very well; we had 200 or so supporting actors in there, all of whom were so committed. They stayed there all day and did wonderful reactions to all the really intense bits. When the first part of the bomb goes off, all of them really, really performed that there was a full-on nuclear explosion going on underneath them." [...] He continued, [...] "We had a big round of applause and celebration after that scene was done because I think we all knew it was going to be pretty monumentous. We said goodbye to countless Tyrells, Kevan Lannister my father, the High Sparrow and dozens of other. It was a pretty extraordinary day." [...] In regards to the non-verbal exchange between Jaime and Cersei Lannister when she is sitting on the Iron Throne, Sapochnik stated [...] "I thought that non-verbal exchange was a very interesting moment but it wasn't clear from the script what exactly Benioff and Weiss wanted. So we just tried a few things, following our noses, drawing from what we knew about these characters and what you see was one of the versions we shot. Interestingly in the edit I still couldn't find a version I felt worked so I actually dropped the moment entirely out of my cut but David and Dan reinstated and to great effect. In fact, I can't really remember the sequence without it anymore. I think he's saying 'don't' and she's saying 'too late.'" [...] He continued [...] "The wonderful thing about filmmaking is you make and remake your film or episode a number of times over the duration of its existence. Firstly in the script stage, second is in prep when you plan how you're going to execute it. Third is in production when you actually get there and have to change everything and finally, in the edit, when you realize what you thought something meant means something totally different when put before or after another juxtaposing or complimentary image." ...|$|E
2500|$|A six-foot five-inch [...] "Blond Giant", Rorke was {{the fastest}} Australian bowler and accused of {{throwing}} by the English press, but this paled beside his excessive dragging. With his gigantic seven-foot stride and <b>dragging</b> <b>his</b> rear foot a yard over the crease {{he could be}} only eighteen yards from the batsman when he finally delivered the ball and at times seemed impossible to score from. Fred Trueman was no balled for <b>dragging</b> <b>his</b> foot {{a couple of inches}} over the crease and wrote [...] "It was really annoying as this umpire seemed to allow Gordon Rorke to bowl with both his feet over the front line!". One picture showed him with his rear foot past the bowling crease before he had even begun to drag. Colin Cowdrey joked [...] "I was frightened that he might tread on my toes".|$|E
