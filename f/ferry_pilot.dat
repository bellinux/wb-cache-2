After that, {{he and his wife}} Virginia Lee Jowell and their eight {{children}} traveled the Pacific in a homemade boat, living in Hawaii, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and finally in Guam. He met his wife in 1944 in Orlando, Florida, where she was a P-47 Thunderbolt <b>ferry</b> <b>pilot</b> and member of the Women Airforce Service Pilots. In Pohnpei, Hagerstrom practiced law, while his wife taught at a college. They eventually returned to the United States and settled in Mansfield, Louisiana, and after living there for a few years, James Hagerstrom died of stomach cancer on June 25, 1994, in nearby Shreveport. He was survived by his wife, as well as six of his children: Mitchell Anne, Eric, Kristen, Tereza, Mark, and Anastasia. On July 26, he was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.|$|E

(The laws in Louisiana and every other state have changed since 1976; Auletta would have been defined as legally intoxicated under today's law in all 50 states.) No other drugs were present. Minyard's report stated that the pilot, Egidio Auletta, had been drinking and was experiencing a large degree of impairment {{at the time of his}} death at the helm.|$|E

50|$|United States <b>ferry</b> <b>pilots</b> {{delivered}} {{aircraft to}} Ladd Army Airfield in Fairbanks, Alaska. There each aircraft was serviced by USAAF personnel {{in preparation for}} Soviet inspection. After Soviet inspectors accepted the aircraft, five regiments of <b>ferry</b> <b>pilots</b> conveyed aircraft from Fairbanks to Soviet pilot training facilities near Krasnoyarsk. Each regiment was assigned to a specific segment of the route {{to become familiar with}} navigation and weather within that segment. Single-seat Bell P-39 Airacobra and Bell P-63 Kingcobra fighters flew in groups with a pair of multi-engine North American B-25 Mitchell or Douglas A-20 Havoc bombers. The lead bomber navigated for the flight and the trailing bomber watched for stragglers. Bombers and Douglas C-47 Skytrains might fly independently, and C-47s transported <b>ferry</b> <b>pilots</b> east for new aircraft.|$|R

25|$|Once {{cleared to}} fly one class of {{aircraft}}, pilots could {{be asked to}} ferry any plane in that class {{even if they had}} never seen that type of aircraft before. To do so they had <b>Ferry</b> <b>Pilot</b> Notes, a two-ring book of small cards with the critical statistics and notations necessary to ferry each aircraft. A pilot cleared on more than one class could be asked to fly an aircraft in any of the categories on which he or she was qualified. Thus even a pilot cleared to fly four-engined bombers could be assigned to fly a single-engined trainer if scheduling made this {{the most efficient way to}} get the aircraft to its destination.|$|E
25|$|She became {{interested}} in flying as an eight-year-old when she saw a barnstormer land in a field near her family's farm. She trained at a flight training school and had her first solo flight in 1941 as a 19-year-old. Ringenberg began her aviation career in 1943 during World War II when she became a <b>ferry</b> <b>pilot</b> with the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP). Although WASP pilots {{were not allowed to}} fly combat missions, they served grueling, often dangerous duties, such as ferrying, test flying, and target towing. The WASP corps was disbanded at the end of 1944. Ringenberg {{went on to become a}} flight instructor in 1945 and flew as a commercial pilot and instructor for the rest of her life. After the war, she answered phones at an airport.|$|E
