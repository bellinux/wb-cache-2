40|$|The {{accumulation}} {{and reduction}} of nitrate <b>in</b> the <b>presence</b> of the nitrogen metabolites asparagine (Asn) and glutamine (Gln) and the carbon metabolite sucrose (Suc) were examined in maize (Zea mays L.) seedlings {{in an attempt to}} separate their effects on the nitrate uptake system and the nitrate reduction system. After 8 h of exposure to nitrate <b>in</b> the <b>presence</b> of 1 mM Asn, tissue nitrate accumulation was reduced at 250 [mu]M external nitrate, but not at 5 mM Asn. The induction of nitrate reductase (NR) activity was reduced at both external nitrate concentrations. <b>In</b> the <b>presence</b> of 1 mM Gln or 1 % Suc, tissue nitrate concentration was not significantly altered, but the induction of root NR activity was reduced or enhanced, respectively. The induction of root nitrite reductase (NiR) activity was also reduced <b>in</b> the <b>presence</b> of Asn or Gln and enhanced <b>in</b> the <b>presence</b> of Suc. Transcript levels of NR and NiR in roots were reduced <b>in</b> the <b>presence</b> of the amides and enhanced <b>in</b> the <b>presence</b> of Suc. When Suc was present in combination with either amide, there was complete relief from the inhibition of NiR transcription observed <b>in</b> the <b>presence</b> of amide alone. In the case of NR, however, this relief from inhibition was negligible. The inhibition of the induction of NR and NiR activities <b>in</b> the <b>presence</b> of Gln and Asn is a direct effect and is not the result of altered nitrate uptake <b>in</b> the <b>presence</b> of these metabolites...|$|R
