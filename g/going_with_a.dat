5|$|After the nationalization, {{the company}} started a {{renovation}} {{process of the}} infrastructure and rolling stock. Combined with a municipal policy of low fares, the company started <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> loss. Five new trams were delivered from 1948 to 1952, and built at the depot at Holtet, with used equipment {{from some of the}} older trams. An additional nine new trams were delivered between 1952 and 1955. Five additional trams were rebuilt from 1955 to 1960, by which time all the narrow trams had been rebuilt or retired. The use of a unique voltage gave operational difficulties, as fuses could regularly blow at Oslo Hospital if errors were made while switching from the one supply to the other. In addition, all the trams were custom-built with extra equipment with limited spare parts. All the trams delivered during the 1950s were built so they could later be converted to only use 600 volt supply. The depot was expanded in 1952.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Hecht-Hill-Lancaster {{acquired}} Success, Lehman was {{in position to}} not only adapt his own novellette but also produce and direct the film. After scouting locations, Lehman was told by Hecht that distributor United Artists was having second thoughts about <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> first-time director, so Hecht offered the film to Mackendrick. Initially the director had reservations about trying to film such a dialogue-heavy screenplay, so he and Lehman worked on it for weeks {{to make it more}} cinematic. As the script neared completion, Lehman became ill and had to resign from the picture. James Hill took over and offered Paddy Chayefsky as Lehman’s replacement. Mackendrick suggested Clifford Odets, the playwright whose reputation as a left-wing hero had been tarnished after he named names before the House Un-American Activities Committee.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} play, DeShazo {{completed}} an 18-yard pass to Still, {{who gave the}} Hokies a first down at their 43-yard line. On the next play, Tech wide receiver Antonio Freeman committed a pass interference penalty, pushing the Hokies back 15 yards. Dwayne Thomas made good the penalty by gaining 16 yards on an option run, which {{was followed by a}} 17-yard pass from DeShazo to Freeman, who kept the Hokies' drive <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> first down at the Tennessee 39-yard line. After an incomplete pass, Thomas broke free for a 27-yard run along {{the left side of the}} field, giving Tech a first down at the Tennessee 13-yard line. Tennessee's defense held for three plays, forcing a fourth down. Instead of kicking a field goal, the Hokies attempted to convert the fourth down by running the ball. DeShazo scrambled, broke free of the defense, and crossed the goal line for the first Tech touchdown of the second half. Williams missed the extra point kick, however, and Tech cut Tennessee's lead to 3516 with 7:03 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

25|$|Their {{lowest point}} {{came during the}} 1964–65 season, when manager Juan Carlos Lorenzo {{announced}} the club could not pay its players and was unlikely {{to be able to}} afford to travel to Vicenza to fulfil its next fixture. Supporters kept the club <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> fundraiser at the Sistine Theatre and bankruptcy was avoided with the election of a new club president Franco Evangelisti.|$|E
25|$|Green Bay {{took the}} ball back with just over 7 minutes left, and found {{themselves}} facing third down and 10 after two plays, but Rodgers kept the drive <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 31-yard completion to Jennings over the middle. Starks then ran 14 yards to the Steelers 30. Two plays later, James Jones caught a 21-yard pass at the 8. The Steelers defense kept Green Bay out of the end zone, causing them to settle for Mason Crosby's 23-yard field goal that gave Green Bay a 31–25 lead with 2:07 left in regulation.|$|E
25|$|After a Bengals punt, Chandler {{gave the}} Chargers good field {{position}} with a 7-yard {{return to the}} 45-yard line. San Diego then drove 55 yards and cut their deficit to 10–7 when Fouts, desperately trying to avoid a hit from lineman Eddie Edwards, managed to fire a pass to Kellen Winslow {{at the line of}} scrimmage, who subsequently raced 33 yards down the right sideline for a score. But the Bengals stormed right back on a drive set up by David Verser's 40-yard kickoff to the 46-yard line. Faced with third down and 7 inside the red zone later in the drive, Anderson kept the drive <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 16-yard completion to Isaac Curtis on the Chargers 1-yard line, and fullback Pete Johnson scored a touchdown run on the next play, giving them a 17–7 lead.|$|E
50|$|Thompson's {{professional}} career began in 1967, {{after he was}} drafted {{in the third round}} in that year's draft. He played for the Geneva Senators, <b>going</b> 2-5 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 3.76 ERA in 10 games started. The following year, he played for the Salisbury Senators, <b>going</b> 7-13 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 4.27 ERA in 29 games (23 games started). In 1969, he improved drastically, <b>going</b> 9-5 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 2.09 ERA in 18 games for the Burlington Senators. The 1970 season was split between the Denver Bears and Pittsfield Senators, <b>going</b> 0-2 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 10.38 ERA for the former and 5-9 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 5.32 ERA for the latter.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, {{he pitched}} again for Louisville, <b>going</b> 6-8 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 4.68 ERA, and in 2016 Axelrod pitched for the New Orleans Zephyrs of the AAA Pacific Coast League, <b>going</b> 9-7 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 4.48 ERA.|$|R

25|$|From October 1992 {{two of the}} Fokkers were {{transferred}} from Norlink to Eurolink. This was {{in part due to}} the Norwegian Armed Forces going over to buying commercial flights and thus more direct services with DC-9s and MD-80s. From then SAS Commuter needed only four aircraft in revenue service, with the fifth being a reserve. By the end of 1992, SAS estimated they had lost NOK250 million on Norlink in isolation, although the commuter services generated significant profitable revenue for the jetliner routes. Later SAS Commuter established a technical and operations base at Trondheim Airport, Værnes. SAS Commuter pulled out of the routes from Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes to Tromsø and Bodø, as well as the route between Tromsø and Lakselv from 1997. These routes were <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> loss and were instead made subject to public service obligations.|$|E
25|$|Woods played {{next in the}} WGC-Cadillac Championship at Doral's Blue Monster course, {{where he}} had never missed the top ten in any event. Woods was never in {{contention}} to win, but kept his streak <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tie for tenth place, scoring 70-74-70-66, for eight-under-par 280, eight shots behind winner Nick Watney. His final round tied for best of the day, and was his lowest 18-hole score on the PGA Tour since {{the third round of}} the 2010 U.S. Open. After the final round, Woods commented that he was making good progress on his game with coach Sean Foley, being able to identify and correct faults during his final round at Doral. Woods put a Nike heel-shafted blade putter in play for the final two rounds, replacing his center-shafted Titleist Scotty Cameron blade model; he explained afterward that he had wanted a hotter putter to tackle Doral's grainy greens.|$|E

50|$|In 1990, Brummett {{played for}} the Clinton Giants, <b>going</b> 2-2 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 3.51 ERA in six games (four starts). He again played for Clinton in 1991, <b>going</b> 10-5 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 2.72 ERA in 16 games. Brummett split the 1992 season with the San Jose Giants and the Phoenix Firebirds. He {{appeared}} in 19 games for the Firebirds, <b>going</b> 10-4 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 2.61 ERA. In three games with Phoenix, he went 0-1 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 7.71 ERA.|$|R

25|$|Dallas scored {{first when}} an {{interception}} by defensive back Darren Woodson {{on his own}} 47 and a 22-yard catch by Michael Irvin sparking a drive to the Panthers 1-yard line. However, Irvin suffered a separated shoulder on his reception and had to miss {{the rest of the}} game. Meanwhile, Dallas could not get into the end zone despite two chances from the 1. Aikman threw an incomplete pass on second down, and on third down, Emmitt Smith was dropped for a three-yard loss, forcing the team to settle for Chris Boniol's 22-yard field goal. On the Panthers ensuing drive, Dallas cornerback Kevin Smith kept it <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pass interference penalty on third down, enabling Carolina quarterback Kerry Collins to complete the 68-yard possession with a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Wesley Walls. On their next series, Winslow Oliver's 15-yard punt return set up a 42-yard drive that ended with Collins' 10-yard touchdown throw to Willie Green, giving the team a 14-3 lead in the second quarter.|$|E
25|$|On {{the second}} {{play of the}} fourth quarter, Bills {{defensive}} back Jeff Burris picked off Brunell's pass and returned it 38 {{yards for a touchdown}} to give his team a 27–20 lead. Jacksonville countered right back, moving the ball 65 yards in 10 plays. McCardell caught two passes for 39 yards on the drive, while Means kept it <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 2-yard run on fourth and 1. Brunell finished the drive with a 2-yard toss to Jimmy Smith that tied the game at 27. On Buffalo's next drive, Hudson made a devastating hit on Kelly, knocking him out of the game and forcing a fumble that was recovered by cornerback Aaron Beasley on the Jags 42-yard line. Brunell then completed a pair of passes to Smith and McCardell for gains of 14 and 11 yards to set up Hollis' 45-yard field goal, putting them back in front for good at 30–27. The Bills offense, now led by Todd Collins, were unable to move the ball on any of their remaining drives, and during the game's final seconds, Tony Brackens forced a fumble while sacking Collins that linebacker Eddie Robinson recovered to seal the win.|$|E
25|$|The Dolphins had to punt {{early in}} the second quarter {{at the end of their}} next drive, once again forcing their defense to deal with the terror of Kelly, Thomas, and Reed. This time the three players would combine for 67 yards as Thomas rushed twice for eight and caught an 11-yard pass before Kelly's 43-yard {{completion}} to Reed brought up first and goal on the Miami 5-yard line. Thomas ran it across the goal line from there, giving the Bills a 20-3 lead. But on this occasion the Dolphins were ready to respond as Marino completed an 11-yard pass to Mark Duper on third and 5, and then hooked up with him again for a 64-yard touchdown completion that cut the score to 20-10. Not to be outdone, Kelly led the Bills back on a 68-yard scoring drive, starting with a 19-yard pass to Lofton on the first play and a 9-yard run on the next. Later in the drive, he kept it <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 13-yard pass to Reed on fourth and 3 from the Dolphins 32, and eventually finished it off with a 7-yard touchdown toss to Lofton. With Norwood's extra point, the Bills were up by 17 at 27-10 with five minutes left in the half.|$|E

500|$|Alaina Huffman {{auditioned for}} Smallville without {{being aware of}} which role was being cast, and was offered the part of Dinah Lance/Black Canary. When the {{producers}} informed her of how major this character is to the DC mythology, Huffman used various comic books and online sources {{to learn more about}} her character. Approached by the producers, Phil Morris auditioned twice for the role of John Jones/Martian Manhunter, and then waited three weeks before receiving confirmation of the role. Morris relished the new design of the character, stepping away from the cape and tights, and <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> more contemporary look. He classified John Jones as Jor-El's [...] "tool, security force, his guardian, and his protector". The actor has stated that he would like his character to lead the future Justice League on the show, as he sees John Jones as a natural leader.|$|E
500|$|The game {{contains}} weapons {{based on}} non-fictional firearms, such as pistols, assault rifles, and submachine guns, {{as well as}} entirely fictional armaments like particle beam weapons. Each firearm differs in terms of ammunition type, accuracy, range, fire rate, damage, and bulkiness. The latter characteristic is crucial, as more powerful/specialized weapons {{tend to be more}} cumbersome and slow the player's maneuvers. Unlike other games of the genre where lighter/smaller weapons tend to be useless, F.E.A.R. does not scale guns on a curve, so any firearm is potentially deadly in most situations. Monolith Productions stated that it aimed for [...] "... a balanced arsenal where each weapon serves a specific function", rather than [...] "... just <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bunch of real-world submachine guns and assault rifles." [...] F.E.A.R.s heads-up display crosshair's size dynamically shows where shots will fall based on movement, aim, and the weapon in use. The player may carry only three firearms at a time; thus, strategy is required when using and selecting weapons.|$|E
500|$|Prior to Burton's involvement, Warner Bros. {{considered}} or discussed Willy Wonka with Bill Murray, Christopher Walken, Steve Martin, Robin Williams, Nicolas Cage, Jim Carrey, Michael Keaton, Robert De Niro, Brad Pitt, Will Smith, Mike Myers, Ben Stiller, Leslie Nielsen, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Patrick Stewart, and Adam Sandler. Dustin Hoffman and Marilyn Manson reportedly {{wanted the}} role as well. [...] Pitt's production company, Plan B Entertainment, however, stayed on to co-finance the film with Warner Bros. Coincidentally, Cleese, Idle and Palin (as {{well as the}} other three Monty Python members) had all previously expressed interest in playing Wonka in the 1971 film adaptation. Johnny Depp was the only actor Burton considered for the role, although Dwayne Johnson was Burton's second choice in case Depp was unavailable. Depp signed on without reading the script under the intention of <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> completely different approach than what Gene Wilder did in the 1971 film adaptation. Depp said regardless of the original film, Gene Wilder's characterization of Willy Wonka stood out as a unique portrayal.|$|E
5000|$|He {{spent the}} 1982 {{season with the}} Denver Bears and Burlington Rangers. He {{appeared}} in only two games for the Bears, <b>going</b> 0-0 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 2.45 ERA. For the Rangers, he made 43 relief appearances, <b>going</b> 6-1 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 1.92 ERA.|$|R

500|$|The French {{electronic}} group Daft Punk {{composed the}} film score of Tron: Legacy, which features over 30 tracks. The score was arranged and orchestrated by Joseph Trapanese. Jason Bentley {{served as the}} film's music supervisor. An electronic music fan, Kosinski stated that to replicate the innovative electronic Tron score by Wendy Carlos [...] "rather than <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> traditional film composer, I wanted to try something fresh and different", adding that [...] "there {{was a lot of}} interest from different electronic bands that I follow to work on the film" [...] but he eventually picked Daft Punk. Kosinski added that he knew the band was [...] "more than just dance music guys" [...] for side projects such as [...] their film Electroma. The duo were first contacted by producers in 2007, when Tron: Legacy was still {{in the early stages of}} production. Since they were touring at the time, producers were unsuccessful in contacting the group. They were again approached by Kosinski, eventually agreeing to take part in the film a year later. Kosinski added that Daft Punk were huge Tron fans, and that his meeting with them [...] "was almost like they were interviewing me to make sure that I was going to hold up to the Tron legacy".|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the season the Astros {{acquired}} outfielder Billy Hatcher from the Cubs for Jerry Mumphrey. Lainer also made a change in the pitching staff, <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> three-man rotation to start the season. [...] This allowed Lanier to keep his three starters (Nolan Ryan, Bob Knepper, and Mike Scott) sharp and to slowly work in rookie hurler Jim Deshaies. Bill Doran and Glenn Davis held down the right side of the field but Lainer rotated the left side. [...] Denny Walling and Craig Reynolds faced the right-handed pitchers while Phil Garner and Dickie Thon batted against left-handers. [...] Lainer knew the Astros had talent and he put it to work.|$|E
2500|$|Tim Burke and Tim Alexander {{were the}} visual effects {{supervisors}} for the film. Tim Alexander said that completing the Inferi-attack scene took several months. He said, [...] "It's certainly much bolder and scarier than we imagined that they'd ever go in a 'Potter' movie. Director David Yates was cautious of {{not making this}} into a zombie movie, so we were constantly {{trying to figure out}} how not to make these dead people coming up look like zombies. A lot of it came down to their movement – they don't move fast, but they don't move really slow or groan and moan. We ended up <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> very realistic style." [...] He also noted that Inferi are skinnier than zombies, waterlogged and grey.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oui. Ah! c'est charmant," [...] he cried, <b>going</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> immense {{flounder}} {{into the}} midst of the amused trappers, and slapping those next to him on the back. [...] "Give me veapon, do, mes ami--gun, pistol, anyting--cannon, if you have von." ...|$|R

However, Liriano would reclaim his dominance of 2013 in the second half of the season, <b>going</b> 6-3 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 2.20 ERA in 14 starts to end the season. Overall, Liriano posted another strong season in 2014, <b>going</b> 7-10 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 3.38 ERA and 175 strikeouts in 29 starts.
