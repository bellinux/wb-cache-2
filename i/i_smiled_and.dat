500|$|There was a TV timeout with under {{four minutes}} in the second half. ...e were tied, or down by one. There was 3:39 on the clock.... I came to the bench, and was kind of looking around. I thought: [...] 'This is it. It is a three-minute game for our season, {{everything}} you've been working for your whole life.' <b>I</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> went for it. That was the most surreal moment. That is a moment I'll never forget.|$|E
2500|$|Harrison's {{favourite}} {{scenes were}} {{shot at the}} coast. She [...] "thought {{that was kind of}} neat. And then jumping on his horse and riding with him and he turned around and <b>I</b> <b>smiled.</b> <b>And</b> we were going off to wherever – was out there. And {{that would have been a}} great way to start – well, they sort of started the next one that way." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{his last}} days, {{some of his}} new disciples began to preach him as God Almighty. I was afraid my meeting with such men would give rise to {{unpleasant}} discussions. So, I kept away. At last, when the news of his fast declining health was brought to me one day, I left all work and went to Dakshineswar. I found him very low. That was before his removal to a more commodious house on the riverside for treatment. Ramkrishna took me to task for neglecting him. I pleaded guilty to the charge and made a clean breast of it by letting him know the exact causes, <b>I</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> said, “As there are many editions of a book so {{there have been many}} editions of God Almighty and your disciples are about to make you a new one.” He too smiled and said, “Just fancy, God Almighty dying of cancer in the throat. What great fools these fellows must be!” ...|$|E
60|$|This was serious. <b>I</b> stopped <b>smiling,</b> <b>and</b> {{begged him}} to explain.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I never larf, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> never <b>smile,</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> never lark nor play, But sit and croak, and {{a single}} joke I have--which is to say: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>smiled</b> enigmatically <b>and</b> spread {{my elbows}} {{as if to}} begin writing again. But this grim, abject, specious, subservient, burr-like wreck of a man would not be shaken off. His {{forehead}} suddenly became shiningly moist.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> {{remained}} head on hand, {{looking out}} of the window forgetful of her.|$|E
60|$|My rising anger {{swept away}} my {{temporary}} helplessness. <b>I</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> told Taylor {{not to look}} so glum.|$|E
6000|$|Is {{not that}} it, Mrs. Betty?' <b>I</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> said nothing. 'Nay,' says he, 'I think the effect has proved {{it to be}} love, for it seems the doctor {{has been able to}} do you but little service; you mend very slowly, they say. I doubt there's {{somewhat}} in it, Mrs. Betty; I doubt you are sick of the incurables, and that is love.' <b>I</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> said, 'No, indeed, sir, that's none of my distemper.' ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>smiled</b> incredulously, <b>and</b> replied: [...] "I am of Ryland's way of thinking, and will, if you please, repeat all his arguments; {{we shall}} see how far you will be induced by them, to change the royal for the {{patriotic}} style." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, no; {{there will}} not be the {{slightest}} danger of that, especially after this inestimable praise from Zenobia," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>smiling,</b> <b>and</b> blushing, no doubt, with excess of pleasure. [...] "I hope, on the contrary, now to produce something that shall really deserve to be called poetry,--true, strong, natural, and sweet, as is the life which we are going to lead,--something that shall have the notes of wild birds twittering through it, or a strain like the wind anthems in the woods, as the case may be." ...|$|R
2500|$|At Stephen King's request, Ellison {{provided}} {{a description of}} himself and his writing in Danse Macabre. [...] "My work is foursquare for chaos. I spend my life personally, and my work professionally, keeping the soup boiling. [...] {{is what they call}} you when you are no longer dangerous; I much prefer troublemaker, malcontent, desperado. I see myself as a combination of Zorro and Jiminy Cricket. My stories go out from here and raise hell. From time to time some denigrater or critic with umbrage will say of my work, 'He only wrote that to shock.' <b>I</b> <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> nod. Precisely." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and,</b> {{looking into}} her eyes, {{was struck by}} their velvet softness. I almost thought she was as charming as she was beautiful.|$|E
6000|$|The folk-lore of {{the years}} agone [...] Remembering, <b>I</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> thought: [...] "Who shudders {{suddenly}} at naught, [...] His grave is being trod upon." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> {{he turned}} sadly away to his horse; {{but he had}} not ridden ten yards before he came back and called to me over the wall.|$|E
6000|$|... "Can you {{recommend}} to me a proper person {{to fill that}} honourable station, sir?" [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>smiling</b> to myself, <b>and</b> exceedingly curious to hear the answer.|$|R
60|$|Miss Jellyby gave my arm {{a squeeze}} and me a very {{significant}} look. <b>I</b> <b>smiled</b> in return, <b>and</b> we made {{the rest of the}} way back very pleasantly.|$|R
5000|$|Second Lieutenant Fujio Wakamatsu wrote: [...] "Mother, I {{have nothing}} to say. In my last moment, and my first act of filial piety, <b>I</b> will <b>smile</b> <b>and</b> conquer. With dry eyes and knowing I have done well. Please offer some rice dumplings at our Buddhist {{mortuary}} tablet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'll excuse you," [...] he said boorishly. <b>I</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> went out. Before I {{was out of}} hearing, Kate whispered vehemently to him, [...] "I {{hate that}} fellow." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then I seem to {{remember}} that I and the two hidalgos bore Philippa to a couch in the patio, while <b>I</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> smiled and talked of {{the heat of the}} weather! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> {{returned}} that I {{would not}} run away. All I wished {{to show him}} was that his enemies were my enemies, that I was ready to fight for my friend.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Prejudice me!' he replied. 'Young man, <b>I</b> <b>smile</b> at, <b>and</b> forgive your folly. Nay, I {{will tell}} you that of which you are not aware, namely, that it was from letters {{received}} from these Fairfords that I first suspected, what the result of my visit to them confirmed, that you were the person whom I had sought for years.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I do, passionately!" [...] <b>I</b> conceded, <b>smiling.</b> <b>And</b> {{this chance}} made me go on, forgetting my compunction {{of a moment}} before. [...] "How can she {{possibly}} have changed their place herself? How can she walk? How can she arrive at that sort of muscular exertion? How can she lift and carry things?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They say love gives {{as well as}} takes; [...] But I'm {{a simple}} maiden,-- [...] My mother's first smile when she wakes [...] <b>I</b> still have <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> prayed in.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{so funny}} to hear my wife called 'Madam Mina' by this kindly, strong-faced old man. <b>I</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> said, [...] "I was ill, I have had a shock, but you have cured me already." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> {{thanked him}} for his enthusiasm in my cause; but I confess I didn't see how {{anything}} on earth of any use to me was likely to arise from this strange proceeding on his part.|$|E
6000|$|What a roar of vulgar {{laughter}} there was! I {{destroyed the}} mongrel reptile on the spot, but <b>I</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> smiled {{all the time}} I was detaching his scalp, for the remark he made was good for an [...] "Injun." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>smiled</b> upon him, <b>and</b> then Cavalcanti and I sprang forward, both together. As we moved, his arms {{loosened}} their hold, and Bianca {{would have fallen}} but that I caught her.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I never larf, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> never <b>smile,</b> [...] <b>And</b> <b>I</b> never lark nor play, [...] But I sit and croak, and {{a single}} joke [...] I have--which is to say: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>smiled</b> again <b>and</b> {{shook my}} head, whereupon {{he went to}} work with the most gingerly and {{delicate}} touches, as if he were handling red-hot iron. At last he managed to tear a hole in the skin, into which he inserted his black nose, and greedily devoured the contents. Despite his caution, however, I noticed that Jacko kept scratching his hands pretty steadily for some time afterwards.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> {{touched her}} glove. [...] "Where thou goest, I will go," [...] I replied; and then could have bitten off my tongue in remorse. [...] "Pah," [...] gasped a secret voice, [...] "so that's going {{the same way}} too, is it?" ...|$|E
60|$|I glanced {{downward}} {{and saw the}} best-seller. I {{picked it}} up and set it carefully farther along {{on the floor of the}} car, where the rain-drops would not fall upon it. And then, suddenly, <b>I</b> <b>smiled,</b> <b>and</b> seemed to see that life has no geographical metes and bounds.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>smiled</b> <b>and</b> held my tongue. Silence costs nothing. But Mr. Higginson's {{political}} opinions, I felt sure, were of {{that simple}} communistic sort which {{the law in}} its blunt way calls fraudulent. They consisted in a belief that all was his which he could lay his hands on.|$|E
60|$|She gave me her hand, <b>and</b> <b>smiled</b> {{her most}} bewitching <b>smile.</b> <b>I</b> turned <b>and</b> stared at Louis. He had no {{alternative}} but to fall back a pace or two.|$|R
5000|$|On July 27, 2010, Ultimate Fakebook self-released {{their first}} album since 2003.

60|$|I {{could have}} put a knife into his cursed body, and would, too, {{if we had been}} alone in the bush; but <b>I</b> had to <b>smile,</b> <b>and</b> smooth him and flatter, for I feared that he might have me sent out.|$|R
