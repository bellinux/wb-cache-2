5|$|Because of {{collisions}} between {{electrons and}} atoms, the drift velocity of electrons in a conductor {{is on the}} order of millimeters per second. However, the speed at which a change of current at one point <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>material</b> causes changes in currents {{in other parts of the}} material, the velocity of propagation, is typically about 75% of light speed. This occurs because electrical signals propagate as a wave, with the velocity dependent on the dielectric constant of the material.|$|E

5|$|The player's primary {{weapon is}} a ghostly {{version of the}} Soul Reaver sword, {{referred}} to as the wraith-blade. The wraith-blade is symbiotically bound to Raziel, and can be summoned or dismissed at any time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>material</b> world, but, if overused, the sword can turn against Raziel, siphoning his health. Other weapons include claws, swords and spears. As the game progresses, the player encounters magical forges which imbue the wraith-blade with elemental powers associated with darkness, light, air, and fire. These enhancements have various uses, but are only available <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>material</b> realm. If Raziel shifts, he loses his active elemental imbuement, and must re-forge the blade at locations scattered throughout the game world.|$|E
5|$|The {{sessions}} {{for most of}} the basic tracks for Living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Material</b> World took place over October and November 1972, with engineer Phil McDonald, but without Harrison's intended co-producer from All Things Must Pass and The Concert for Bangladesh, Phil Spector. According to the album credits, the location for the recording was the Beatles' Apple Studio in London, although bassist Klaus Voormann has stated that the true venue was Harrison's new home studio, FPSHOT, in Oxfordshire.|$|E
5|$|At first, Raziel can jump, glide {{using his}} torn wings, move blocks, {{and pick up}} and throw objects and enemies. Initially unarmed, he fights using his claws, but can {{alternatively}} use weapons such as rocks, torches, spears and staffs, and the Soul Reaver. Raziel can freely shift to the spectral realm, but can return to the material realm only through special portals when at full health. Raziel automatically shifts to the spectral realm if he runs out of health. As the game progresses, Raziel gains the powers of his clan brothers after defeating them and becomes able to phase through gates in the spectral realm and climb walls <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>material</b> realm. Initially vulnerable to water, he overcomes this weakness and learns to swim.|$|E

5|$|Combat in Soul Reaver is a hack and slash system, {{involving}} {{the use of}} combinations of various different attacks before a finishing move. Raziel's enemies are grouped into humans, spectral creatures, and most commonly, vampires. Human enemies include peasants, vampire hunters and vampire worshippers. In the spectral realm, players fight minor enemies called Sluagh and the souls of dead vampires who have become wraiths. Each brood of vampire enemies has unique powers reminiscent of their clan leader. Human and spectral enemies can be killed with Raziel's claws or any weapon, but vampires must be bludgeoned into a stunned state and then destroyed by impaling them, lighting them on fire, or tossing them into a hazard such as sunlight or water. When killed, enemies leave behind souls that replenish Raziel's health, which automatically decreases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>material</b> realm and increases in the spectral. Possession of the Soul Reaver sword stops automatic degeneration of health in the physical realm, but Raziel loses the sword instantly if he sustains damage and can regain it only by restoring his health to full.|$|E
5|$|Dark Horse is {{the fifth}} studio album by English rock {{musician}} George Harrison, released on Apple Records in December 1974 as the follow-up to Living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Material</b> World. Although keenly anticipated on release, Dark Horse {{is associated with the}} controversial North American tour that Harrison staged with Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar in November and December that year. This was the first US tour {{by a member of the}} Beatles since 1966, and the public's nostalgia for the band, together with Harrison contracting laryngitis during rehearsals and choosing to feature Shankar so heavily in the program, resulted in scathing concert reviews from some influential music critics.|$|E
5|$|Fiberglass is a fiber {{reinforced}} polymer made {{of plastic}} reinforced by glass fibers, commonly woven into a mat. The glass fibers used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>material</b> are made of various types of glass depending upon the fiberglass use. These glasses all contain silica or silicate, with varying amounts of oxides of calcium, magnesium, and sometimes boron. The boron is present as borosilicate, borax, or boron oxide, and is added to increase {{the strength of the}} glass, or as a fluxing agent to decrease the melting temperature of silica, which is too high to be easily worked in its pure form to make glass fibers.|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method for}} tension fracture of materials which exhibit strain-softening is presented here {{by use of}} the hybrid stress model. When tension fracture occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>materials,</b> <b>the</b> stress field has to satisfy the equation of stress-crack width relation on cracking surfaces. For numerical analysis, the equation has to be introduced into {{the principle of the}} hybrid complementary energy using Lagrange multipliers defined on cracking surfaces. This method is useful for tension fracture analysis because the size of total stiffness matrix does not increase even for calculation under the condion of cracking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>materials.</b> <b>The</b> results of computer simulation on compact tension (CT) test by this method yield a good agreement with the experimental ones...|$|R
40|$|Construction {{materials}} usually {{constitute a}} major portion of <b>the</b> total cost <b>in</b> a building construction project.

5|$|Living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Material</b> World {{is notable}} for the uncompromising lyrical content of its songs, {{reflecting}} Harrison's struggle for spiritual enlightenment against {{his status as}} a superstar, as well as for what many commentators consider to be the finest guitar and vocal performances of his career. In contrast with All Things Must Pass, Harrison scaled down the production for Material World, using a core group of musicians comprising Nicky Hopkins, Gary Wright, Klaus Voormann and Jim Keltner. Ringo Starr, John Barham and Indian musician Zakir Hussain were among the album's other contributors.|$|E
5|$|Raziel retains most of {{the powers}} he possessed in the {{previous}} game, such as the abilities to glide, climb walls, fire bolts of telekinetic energy, and swim. To sustain his strength and travel between the planes, he must devour souls; this is typically accomplished by defeating enemies. The game's combat consists of a hack and slash system, entailing the use of combinations of attacks before executing a finishing move. Human enemies exist only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>material</b> world, and include mercenaries, demon hunters, and the Sarafan, a monastic order of vampire hunters; other material creatures include dogs, thralls, and mutants. Sluagh are enemies who exclusively inhabit the spirit world, whereas cross-planar beings such as demons and shades can pursue the player between both realms. Enemies leave behind souls when killed, which replenish Raziel's health once consumed.|$|E
5|$|Sessions for Living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Material</b> World {{took place}} at Apple Studio in central London and at Harrison's Friar Park studio, FPSHOT, {{beginning}} in October 1972. Despite his original intention to co-produce with Phil Spector as before, Harrison was sole producer throughout the sessions, with Phil McDonald again serving as recording engineer. While Harrison succeeded in paring down the album's production after the Wall of Sound excesses of All Things Must Pass, commentators note that he incorporated aspects of Spector's signature style on this and other songs on Material World, {{through the use of}} orchestral strings and brass, a choir and multiple drummers.|$|E
50|$|Although {{all matter}} is formed by atoms, matter can have {{different}} properties and appear in different forms, such as solid, liquid, superfluid, magnet, etc. These {{various forms of}} matter are often called states of matter or phases.

5|$|Shaktism's {{focus on}} the Divine Feminine does not imply a {{rejection}} of masculine. It rejects male-female, soul-body, transcendent-immanent dualism, considering nature as divine. Devi {{is considered to be}} the cosmos itself – she is the embodiment of energy, matter and soul, the motivating force behind all action and existence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>material</b> universe. Yet in Shaktism, states C. MacKenzie Brown, the masculine and the feminine are aspects of the divine, transcendent reality. In Hindu iconography, the cosmic dynamic of masculine-feminine interdependence and equivalence, is expressed in the half-Shakti, half-Shiva deity known as Ardhanari.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} originated {{during a}} period marked by Harrison's devotion to a Hindu-aligned ascetic life and {{the height of his}} public association with the Hare Krishna movement, which included his donation of Bhaktivedanta Manor for use as an ISKCON temple. In his lyrics, Harrison sings of the falsehood of striving for wealth or power <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>material</b> world and advocates a direct relationship with one's deity as a genuine life goal. In doing so, he belittles the role of political leaders, as well as his own status as a celebrated rock musician. The song's Krishna Conscious message was also reflected in Harrison's choice of artwork for the Material World album, specifically the reproduction of a painting from a Prabhupada-published edition of the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E
5|$|The will, Balzac cautions, is a {{destructive}} force that seeks only to acquire power unless tempered by knowledge. The shopkeeper presents a foil for Valentin's future self, offering study and mental development {{as an alternative}} to consuming desire. Foedora also serves as a model for resistance to the corruption of will, insofar as she seeks at all times to excite desire in others while never giving in to her own. That Valentin is happiest living <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>material</b> squalor of his tiny garret– lost in study and writing, with the good-hearted Pauline giving herself to him– underscores the irony of his misery {{at the end of the}} book, when he is surrounded with the fruits of his material desire.|$|E
