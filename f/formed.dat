5|$|While {{all four}} boroughs were <b>formed</b> after Sullivan County was established, {{seven of the}} nine townships were <b>formed</b> while still part of Lycoming County.

Elkland Township was <b>formed</b> from Shrewsbury in 1804, as were Cherry (1824), Davidson (1833), and Forks Townships (1833). Plunketts Creek Township was <b>formed</b> from Franklin and Davidson Townships in 1838, and Fox Township was <b>formed</b> from Elkland in 1839. When Sullivan County was <b>formed</b> in 1847, both Shrewsbury and Plunketts Creek Townships were split, with each county having a township of that name.
