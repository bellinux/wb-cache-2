40|$|A goal of any {{precision}} departure concept, such as NASA Precision Departure Release Capability, is {{to improve}} throughput, efficiency and capacity by integrating departure, arrival and surface operations. This kind of concept {{is believed to have}} the potential of increasing flight efficiency and throughput by not missing assigned overhead-stream or arrival-stream slots. In the current Call For Release scheduling, a slot can be missed because of airport-departure delay, which is the sum of gate-departure <b>delay,</b> <b>ramp</b> delay, and taxi-out delay. This delay can be reduced by improved precision departure scheduling. The main thrust of the paper is to determine the delay-cost impact of Call For Release scheduling before gate-push-back and at gate-push-back. Seven different variations of scheduling algorithms were used in the simulation. Results reported in the paper considers 37, 346 flights in the National Airspace System for one day in January 2011. Approximately 1, 500 airports were included in the simulation. Results show that there is no significant benefit of scheduling before gate-push-back as opposed to at gate-push-back under assumed gate-departure and taxi-out time un-certainties, assuming a Call For Release is strategically done for all departures from all airports. However, if there were no gate-departure and taxi-out time uncertainty, which is unlikely in reality, the maximum benefit of scheduling an hour before gate-push-back is limited to 6. 8 % reduction in weighted delay (2 *airborne delay + ground delay) compared to delay resulting from scheduling at gate-push-back.

We propose a framework to systematically address frequency measurement and response delays and we determine safe values for the total delays via simulations. We introduce a controllability index to evaluate PFC provision under lockout constraints of refrigerators compressors. We conduct extensive simulations to study the effects of measurement <b>delay,</b> <b>ramping</b> times, lockout durations and rotational inertia on the controllability of the aggregation and system stability.

30|$|Finally, we have {{showed that}} if a ramping time of a few seconds is introduced, the allowed delays can be longer, but from a power system’s {{perspective}} an immediate response results in better frequency profiles (smaller deviations and settling times for the power oscillations). Therefore, {{there is a clear}} trade-off between the loads’ response <b>delay</b> and their <b>ramping</b> rate. If the response delay is relatively large due to practical limitations (for instance due to a long FMT), then the ramping rate must decrease, to avoid large power oscillations and unsafe system operation. This trade-off can be incorporated in the PFC scheme by defining certain allowed regions for combinations of response <b>delays</b> and <b>ramping</b> rates. The operator would enforce lower ramping rates to aggregations which exhibit larger response delays and would allow faster ramping rates when loads can response with smaller delays. Since a higher ramping rate improves the system’s performance (provided that the delay is sufficiently small), a performance payment should be followed, where these resources would be remunerated with higher prices, to ensure a fair compensation to the providers.|$|R
40|$|This paper explores drivers' {{subjective}} {{value of}} time under moving and stopped freeway travel conditions using a stated preference survey. Unlike previous studies that assume a constant value of time, this research relates perceived satisfaction of a freeway trip to its quality indicators. Sixty-nine {{subjects in the}} Twin Cities are asked in the survey to rank sixteen driving scenarios in four condition sets with different durations of ramp wait and freeway travel. Several utility functions are specified where the weight of <b>ramp</b> <b>delay</b> {{is a function of}} the length of the delay itself and subject specific variables, and the resulting choice models estimated using rank-ordered logit and binary logit techniques. Results suggest that drivers perceive ramp wait as more onerous than freeway travel. Drivers also weight each minute of ramp wait more heavily as the length of the delay gets longer. Although the subjects show some tolerance to the first several minutes of <b>ramp</b> <b>delay</b> (less than 5 minutes), they perceive long delays as much as twelve times more onerous than time in motion. The derived weighting function for ramp wait can improve the design of freeway traffic control strategies that trade-off freeway <b>delay</b> with <b>ramp</b> wait. The findings also enable a more utility-based approach for freeway operations than the current method which has the engineering efficiency objective of minimizing total system delay or maximizing throughput. Minimizing total perceived travel time is probably more appropriate than minimizing total absolute travel time which does not take into account driver acceptance. The weighting function can also be easily transformed into a value of time function for project evaluation purposes. Minnesota Department of Transportatio...|$|R

This paper analyzes the results with and without ramp metering for several representative freeways during the afternoon peak period, depending on data availability.

It is found that ramp meters are particularly helpful for long trips relative to short trips. On Route 169, trips more than 3 exits in length benefit, while those 3 exits or less are hurt by ramp meters. Ramp metering, while generally beneficial to freeway segments, may not improve trip travel times (including <b>ramp</b> <b>delays).</b> Travel time variation is reduced as another benefit from ramp meters.

To address this problem, NASA researchers have developed optimization algorithms and a concept of operations for an airport surface traffic management tool called the Spot and Runway Departure Advisor (SARDA). Past SARDA research efforts have {{been focused on the}} Dallas/Fort Worth International airport. This paper describes the development of SARDA-like schedulers for managing the traffic at an operationally dissimilar airport―Charlotte Douglas International airport, and presents the results of a fast-time simulation-based benefits assessment. Fast-time simulations were conducted to test the benefits of optimized scheduling over a baseline model of current-day operations. In the fast-time simulations, it was observed that optimization schedulers reduced movement area delays by up to 3. 1 minutes per departure on average, as compared to the baseline simulation. The movement area delay savings translated to shorter movement area taxi-out times and an average reduction in fuel burn and emissions of approximately 24 % per departure. The overall trend observed in the total delay (gate <b>delay</b> + <b>ramp</b> <b>delay</b> + movement area delay) comparison indicated the optimization schedulers were not able to reduce total delay, and runway throughput comparisons suggested the optimization schedulers had little to no effect on throughput.

40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. February 2011. Major: Civil Engineering. Advisor: Dr Nikolas Geroliminis. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); x, 112 pages; appendices A-B. Freeway ramp metering {{has been widely}} employed as an effective strategy to reduce congestion and increase the freeway operational efficiency for over two decades. Over the years, a number of isolated and coordinated metering strategies have been developed and deployed {{various parts of the}} world. Minnesota, first through the Zone metering algorithm, and later through its successor, the Stratified Zone Metering algorithm, has been among the states that extensively use freeway on-ramp metering. Based on MnDOT Regional Traffic Management Center (RTMC) ’s recommendation, alternatives for developing the next generation strategy to address limitations and substantially enhance the performance of the currently deployed Stratified Ramp Metering strategy were explored. Following a different approach, the Next Generation strategy was developed by focusing on density rather than flow. This is because (as shown in earlier research) while values of occupancy near capacity are quite stable, bottleneck capacity has stochastic variations and a control strategy based on flow thresholds is likely to be inefficient. This variability in the capacity flow would mean that a control strategy based on flow thresholds would be likely to either under-load the freeway during the uncongested regime of traffic flow, or overload the system after the occurrence of the breakdown. While the former might lead to early onsets of congestion (congestion not being delayed as much as possible since the full capacity of the system is not utilized), the later might mean that the system is unable to recover from congestion efficiently (due to an over-load on the system). Critical occupancy however, and therefore density, iii is known to have stable behavior at capacity. This suggests that using a density based control approach can potentially enhance the overall performance of the system. During {{the first part of the}} study we developed a methodology to estimate densities with space and time based on data from loop detectors. The methodology is based on solving a flow conservation differential equation (using LWR theory) with intermediate (internal) freeway mainline boundaries, which is faster and more accurate than previous research using only external boundaries. Capacity drop phenomenon is inherently incorporated in the density estimation process, and the effect of the stochastic nature of capacity flow is minimized by identifying bottleneck threats and zones based on critical density values. Results compared with micro-simulation of a long freeway stretch show that this model produces reliable and accurate results. We further extended this density estimator using a two-value capacity (before and after the occurrence of a breakdown) and we integrated it in the LWR formulation. By carefully analyzing empirical data of active bottlenecks in the Twin Cities Metropolitan Area we noticed that (i) there are many cases where capacity is underutilized (4 min <b>ramp</b> <b>delay</b> constraint is misinterpreted by the algorithm) and (ii) the system once congested is unable to return to a state of flow near capacity for too long. One of the main reasons for the above inefficiencies is that capacity is considered constant during all times at all bottlenecks. This is concluded based on two empirical findings: (i) a significant capacity drop after the breakdown in many locations (varying iv 0 - 15 %) and (ii) the total capacity of a bottleneck (sum of mainline + on ramp) is a function of the ratio of the two flows. More specifically, when ramp flows are higher the capacity is smaller (~ 5 - 10 %). This happens very often in MN ramps because of the 4 minute constraint in <b>ramp</b> <b>delays.</b> Instead of a layer-based algorithm, we proceed with a dynamic zone-based algorithm. The whole freeway system is divided into zones, where the length of each zone is dynamic and is estimated in real-time. Within each zone the metering rates are chosen independently of conditions in other zones. The algorithm’s goal is to keep the car density levels at all ramps below the congestion thresholds and not to allow low speeds to occur in the mainline, by constraining the <b>ramp</b> <b>delays.</b> The <b>ramp</b> rates become stricter when mainline density is close to the congestion threshold, and the ramp rates increase when ramp waiting times are close to the <b>ramp</b> <b>delay</b> threshold. When it is not possible to keep both uncongested because of high on-ramp and mainline demands, the algorithm seeks to delay as long as possible the violation of both thresholds. The effectiveness of the new control strategies has been assessed by comparison with the current Stratified Zone Metering (SZM) version through microscopic simulation for the H- 169 site. Under the new control strategy the total travel time on the mainline decreased by 1. 5 %, the ramp total travel time dropped by nearly 20 %, the total system (freeway and ramp) travel time decreased by about 3 % and total delays decreased by 8 %. This finding suggests that in this case the new strategy is very effective since it reduces not only <b>ramp</b> <b>delay,</b> but also total system delay. The results clearly indicate that the new control strategy is very effective in keeping ramp wait times below the maximum allowed and in reducing <b>ramp</b> <b>delay</b> time. Another interesting observation made by analyzing the simulation results is that the new strategy substantially reduces ramp queues, while the overall <b>ramp</b> <b>delay</b> for the peak period was reduced by nearly 30 %. The effectiveness of the newly developed control strategy is then assessed using the AIMSUN traffic micro-simulator against the currently deployed strategy. The new metering strategies is deployed on a simulated network and implemented using the AIMSUN API module. The strategy is compared against the current strategy using various measures of effectiveness and is found to succeed in delaying the onset of breakdown, accelerating system recovery after breakdown, and improving the overall freeway and ramp performances (through improved speeds and throughputs and reduced delays and stoppages). A proposal for field implementation of the new strategy and of comparison studies of performance based on ‘before’ and ‘after’ studies is suggested as a follow up for the study...|$|R

40|$|Secondary {{frequency}} {{regulation is}} a necessary electric grid ancillary service that balances electric power system supply and demand on short time intervals of seconds to minutes. Commercial HVAC chillers may be well positioned to provide secondary frequency regulation as a demand side resource. Commercial 200 ton (703 kWth) chillers serving two buildings in the Boston area are used to experimentally develop a practical closed-loop controller that modifies chiller power demand to provide secondary frequency regulation. In the first setup, a physical controller is connected directly to the chiller and adjusts power through chilled water setpoint. In the second setup, both the chiller and air handling units are controlled through the BAS. Demonstrations using standard electric system operator test routines show the chiller power response to exceed qualification requirements while providing up to +/- 25 % of chiller nameplate power in secondary frequency regulation capability. The controller is further demonstrated to provide secondary frequency regulation continuously for several hours longer than the standard test routines, during which building cooling load changes significantly. Analysis of results indicate minimum power and variable COP as two factors that could be incorporated into future models to more accurately reflect observed chiller transient behaviour and predict performance. BAS communication <b>delays,</b> <b>ramp</b> rate limits, and compressor cycling are additional factors that can have significant negative impacts on controller performance. Extrapolation of experiment results to higher-level analysis indicates that chillers {{can contribute to the}} secondary frequency regulation requirements at the grid level in aggregate, although potential varies greatly depending on climate and building type. There is more potential in the south, where 21 % of secondary frequency regulation requirements might be met with chillers; the contribution of chillers in colder climates is minimal. Short-term power balance to achieve stability is essential for the operation of the modern electrical power system. Providing stability through modified control of existing HVAC chillers in commercial buildings is a technologically feasible alternative to existing solutions and can make a meaningful contribution to the electrical grid. by Po-An (Leo) Su.

It is of great interest, at least practically, to investigate whether the simplified theory {{can be used to}} simulate freeway traffic merging and diverging behavior. In his paper, Newell assumed that on-ramp traffic always has the priority and can bypass queues, if any. This assumption will be released so that traffic from the mainline and the on-ramp will have to compete for downstream supply. For off-ramps, Newell assumed that all vehicles that want to exit can always be able to do so. Again, this assumption is also released so that queues from either downstream can build up and block upstream traffic. Though Newell confined his theory to freeway mainline, it is possible to describe freeway merging and diverging behavior after relaxing some of its assumptions. This has important practical implications because the extension would allow analysis of alternate diversion strategies (in case of incidents on the freeway) and ramp metering strategies (to minimize the overall system-wide delay) if a queuing model computing <b>delays</b> on <b>ramps</b> is incorporated. 2 SUMMAR [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In {{high speed}} digital {{integrated}} circuits, interconnects delay can be significant {{and should be}} included for accurate analysis. Delay analysis for interconnect has been done widely by using moments of the impulse response, from the explicit Elmore delay (the first moment of the impulse response) expression, to moment matching methods which creates reduced order trans impedance and transfer function approximations. However, the Elmore delay is fast becoming ineffective for deep submicron technologies, and reduced order transfer function delays are impractical for use as early phase design metrics or as design optimization cost functions. This paper describes an approach for fitting moments of the impulse response to probability density functions so that delay can be estimated accurately at an early physical design stage. For RC trees it is demonstrated that the inverse gamma function provides a provably stable approximation. We used the PERI (Probability distribution function Extension for Ramp Inputs) technique that extends <b>delay</b> metrics for <b>ramp</b> inputs to the more general and realistic non-step inputs. The accuracy of our model is justified with the results {{compared with that of}} SPICE simulations...|$|R
50|$|The recent M1 Upgrade in Melbourne has {{installed}} 62 ramp meters that are coordinated using the HERO suite of algorithms developed by Markos Papageorgiou and Associates from the Technical University of Crete. The {{system has been}} built on the STREAMS platform and utilises the state-of-the-art ITS architecture. All the ramps can be linked when required to resolve motorway bottlenecks before they emerge. The results of a recent trial improved capacity by 9% over the previous fixed time ramp metering system, average speeds increased by 20kmh and traffic throughput at bottleneck locations can be reliably maintained around 2200 PCE per lane (note the M1 is major freight route to the Port of Melbourne and has a very high heavy articulated vehicle mix. The HERO system takes real time data every 20 seconds from the motorway, ramps and arterial road in order determine the best signal timing for the next 20 seconds. The data detection system comprises Sensys detectors in every freeway lane at 500m spacings with a minimum detectors at three locations on each ramp including the freeway entrance with the arterial road. The system also manages the arterial road interface with the freeway, balances <b>ramp</b> queues and <b>delays</b> across <b>ramps,</b> and is capable of managing bottlenecks 3-4 km downstream of a ramp entrance. The system is also supplemented by real time travel time information to key destinations and incident and congestion information displayed on specially designed full colour VMS on the approaches to the freeway entrance ramps. This information provides sufficient advice for motorists {{to determine whether or}} not to use the freeway during incidents etc. The system also provides dynamic ramp closure in the event of a major incident.|$|R
40|$|Aircraft taxiing on {{the surface}} {{contribute}} significantly to the fuel burn and emissions at airports. This paper investigates the possibility of reducing fuel burn and emissions from surface operations through a reduction of the taxi times of departing aircraft. A novel approach is proposed that models the aircraft departure process as a queuing system, and attempts to reduce taxi times and emissions through improved queue management strategies. The departure taxi (taxi-out) time of an aircraft is represented as a sum of three components, namely, the unimpeded taxi-out time, the {{time spent in the}} departure queue, and the congestion <b>delay</b> due to <b>ramp</b> and taxiway interactions. The dependence of the taxi-out time on these factors is analyzed and modeled. The performance of the model is validated through a comparison of its predictions with observed data at Boston’s Logan International Airport (BOS). The reductions in taxi-out times from the proposed queue management strategy are translated to reductions in fuel burn and emissions using ICAO engine models for the taxi phase of the flight profile.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} to divide the total congestion delay in a freeway section into six components: the delay caused by incidents, special events, lane closures, and adverse weather; the potential reduction in delay at bottlenecks that ideal ramp metering can achieve; and the remaining delay, caused mainly by excess demand. The fully automated method involves two steps. First, the components of nonrecurrent congestion are estimated by statistical regression. Second, the method locates all bottlenecks and estimates the potential reduction in <b>delay</b> that ideal <b>ramp</b> metering can achieve. The method {{can be applied to}} any site with minimum calibration. It requires data about traffic volume and speed; the time and location of incidents, special events, and lane closures; and adverse weather. Applied to a 45 -mi section of I- 880 in the San Francisco Bay Area in California, the method reveals that incidents, special events, rain, potential reduction by ideal ramp metering, and excess demand respectively account for 13. 3 %, 4. 5 %, 1. 6 %, 33. 2 %, and 47. 4 %, respectively, of the total daily delay. The delay distribution of the various components is different between the morning and evening peak periods and between the two freeway directions. Quantifying the components of congestion at individual freeway sites is essential for developing effective congestion mitigation strategies. Urban Studies and Planning...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies suggest}} that the {{cerebellum}} and basal ganglia are involved in sub-second and supra-second timing, respectively. To test this hypothesis at the cellular level, we examined the activity of single neurons in the cerebellar dentate nucleus in monkeys performing the oculomotor version of the self-timing task. Animals were trained to report the passage of time of 400, 600, 1200, or 2400 ms following a visual cue by making self-initiated memory-guided saccades. We found a sizeable preparatory neuronal activity before self-timed saccades across delay intervals, while the time course of activity correlated with the trial-by-trial variation of saccade latency in different ways depending on the length of the delay intervals. For the shorter <b>delay</b> intervals, the <b>ramping</b> up of neuronal firing rate started just after the visual cue and the rate of rise of neuronal activity correlated with saccade timing. In contrast, for the longest delay (2400 ms), the preparatory activity started late during the delay period, and its onset time correlated with self-timed saccade latency. Because electrical microstimulation applied to the recording sites during saccade preparation advanced self-timed but not reactive saccades, regardless of their directions, the signals in the cerebellum may have a causal role in self-timing. We suggest that the cerebellum may regulate timing in both sub-second and supra-second ranges, although its relative contribution might be greater for sub-second than for supra-second time intervals...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} results (done in Phase II) {{demonstrated that}} the SZM strategy was generally beneficial. However, they also revealed that freeway performance degraded by reducing the <b>ramp</b> <b>delays.</b> Therefore, it is desired to improve {{the effectiveness of the}} current SZM control. There are two objectives in this study. One objective is to improve the control logic of current SZM strategy. This is accomplished through an estimation algorithm for the refined minimum release rate. The simulation results indicate that the improved SZM strategy is very effective in postponing and decreasing freeway congestion while resulting in smoother freeway traffic flow compared to the SZM strategy. The second objective of this project is to improve the current queue size estimation. Depending on the counting error of queue and passage detectors, freeway ramps are classified into three different categories, and different methods are applied respectively for improved queue size estimation. The surveillance video data were recorded and used to verify the improvement of the proposed methods. The results indicate that the proposed methods can greatly improve the accuracy of queue size estimation compared with the current methodology. Also, the proposed method was evaluated by the micro-simulation. The simulation results indicate the performance of freeway mainline is significantly improved. And the total system performance is better than the original SZM control. Minnesota Department of Transportatio...|$|R
