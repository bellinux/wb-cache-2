5|$|Interested in {{the ability}} of the human body to {{withstand}} and survive pain, No forces Bond to navigate his way through an obstacle course constructed in the facility's ventilation system. Bond is kept under observation as he suffers <b>electric</b> <b>shocks,</b> burns and an encounter with large poisonous spiders. Bond's ordeal ends in a fight with a captive giant squid, which he defeats by using improvised weapons. After his escape he encounters Rider, who has been pegged out to be eaten by crabs; they had ignored her and she managed to escape.|$|E
5|$|At Elizabeth's first {{interrogation}} session, the Japanese {{told her}} that some ships had been sunk in the harbour {{and they wanted to}} know the location of a large amount of money. She claimed no knowledge of the matter but was repeatedly interrogated and beaten. At various times, the Kempeitai forced Elizabeth to kneel on some angled bars of wood on the floor. They stripped her topless and tied her to the wood so she could not go either forwards or backwards. Then they applied <b>electric</b> <b>shocks</b> to her. They even brought in her husband to let him see her being tortured. After nine months in captivity, Elizabeth had lost half her body weight.|$|E
5|$|Although it was series co-creator and {{producer}} Gerry Anderson's original plan to film with actual alligators, AP Films instead acquired {{a group of}} juvenile crocodiles from a private zoo in northern England; these would double as re-sized alligators on scale model sets and water tanks. With {{the exception of a}} five-foot (1.5m) specimen, which was too aggressive to be removed from its box, the animals were three feet (0.91m) long. The crew kept the on-set water tanks heated to a suitably warm temperature and used <b>electric</b> <b>shocks</b> to induce movement from the reptiles. They were unpredictable and very difficult to control and film, either bathing {{in the heat of the}} studio lights or disappearing into the tanks and remaining submerged for hours. To make the crocodiles more visible to the cameras, the crew fixed them to guiding rods and co-ordinated their movements. The heavy presence of the animals in both puppet and scale model shots resulted in a closer-than-normal degree of collaboration between the puppet and effects crews.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. It is {{difficult}} to detect and judge a weak <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> signals in the leakage current accurate in the low-voltage power grid. A novel chaotic detection of the <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> current and Lyapunov exponent is introduced in this paper. <b>Electric</b> <b>shock</b> current component is extracted according to the characteristics that chaotic system’s bifurcation action from chaotic state is sensitive to the weak signals and immune to noise. The largest Lyapunov exponent is proposed as the judgment criterion of phase transition of chaotic system. It can automatically recognize the critical state before and after <b>electric</b> <b>shock...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> {{victims were}} {{predominantly}} male, {{and more than}} half of the victims were found in companies with less than five employees in terms of the scale of company, and also more than half of victims had less than one month of experience for work experience. Considering the category of industry, more than half of the victims were engaged in construction, and considering the subcategory of industries, more than 60 % of <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> victims were found in building and other construction works. This study intended to conduct an in-depth analysis on the cause of <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> accidents to provide basic data for policy proposing taking into considering the characteristics such as the <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> path, low voltage, grounding and protection of workers.

40|$|The {{microscopic}} nematode Caenorhabditis elegans {{has emerged}} as a valuable model for understanding the molecular and cellular basis of neurological disorders. The worm offers important physiological similarities to mammalian models such as conserved neuron morphology, ion channels, and neurotransmitters. While a wide-array of behavioral assays are available in C. elegans, an assay for electroshock/electroconvulsion remains absent. Here, we have developed a quantitative behavioral method to assess the locomotor response following <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> in C. elegans. <b>Electric</b> <b>shock</b> impairs normal locomotion, and induces paralysis and muscle twitching; after a brief recovery period, shocked animals resume normal locomotion. We tested <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> responses in loss-of-function mutants for unc- 25, which encodes the GABA biosynthetic enzyme GAD, and unc- 49, which encodes the GABAA receptor. unc- 25 and unc- 49 mutants have decreased inhibitory GABAergic transmission to muscles, and take significantly more time to recover normal locomotion following <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> compared to wild-type. Importantly, increased sensitivity of unc- 25 and unc- 49 mutants to <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> is rescued by treatment with antiepileptic drugs, such as retigabine. Additionally, we show that pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), a GABAA receptor antagonist and proconvulsant in mammalian and C. elegans seizure models, increases susceptibility of worms to <b>electric</b> <b>shock...</b>|$|R
5|$|Because of {{its size}} and {{electrical}} defenses, the marbled electric ray does not often fall prey to other animals such as sharks. This species exhibits different defensive behaviors depending on whether a prospective predator grasps it by the disc or the tail. A ray touched on the disc will quickly turn toward the threat while producing electric shocks; {{this is followed by}} it fleeing in a straight line, after which it may re-bury itself. A ray touched on the tail will propel itself upward into a loop; if it has not escaped after the maneuver, the ray will curl into a ring with the belly facing outward, so as to present the area of its body with the highest electric field gradient (the underside of the electric organs) towards the threat; these behaviors are accompanied by short, strong <b>electric</b> <b>shocks.</b> The ray tends to produce more electric bursts when protecting its tail than when protecting its disc.|$|E
5|$|Nocturnal and solitary, the marbled {{electric}} ray can often be found lying the sea floor buried except for its eyes and spiracles. This slow-moving predator feeds almost exclusively on small bony fishes, which it ambushes from the bottom and subdues with strong electric bursts. It defends itself by turning towards the threat, swimming in a loop, or curling up with its underside facing outward, while emitting <b>electric</b> <b>shocks</b> to drive off the prospective predator. Its paired electric organs are capable of producing 70–80 volts of electricity. This species is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos sustained by yolk and histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Mating takes place from November to January, and females bear litters of 3–32 pups every other year after a gestation period of 9–12 months. The newborn ray is immediately capable of using electricity to hunt.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{makes an}} {{appointment}} {{at the clinic}} and pays for it by pawning their television. This only frustrates {{the rest of the}} Simpsons as he takes them to the scheduled appointment. In the waiting room, they claim the family doesn't have a problem and are silenced by Homer. Dr. Monroe encourages them to express their unhappiness with a series of exercises. The first is a drawing exercise, which he encourages them to draw out the source of their problems. Most of the Simpsons vent out their anger by drawing Homer as they see him. When Dr. Monroe observes it, he realizes that Homer is likely the source of their issues in the family. This is evident when he proves his own inattentive nature in being lost in the exercise and having the family view him as such, including being too strict as a disciplinarian. The other methods in getting the family {{to talk to each other}} in a normal matter fail. Dr. Monroe finally takes matters into his own hands and sends them all to a generator room, allowing them to deliver <b>electric</b> <b>shocks</b> to each other. The family shocks one another to the point of causing a power drain on the city. Unable to help them, Dr. Monroe gives the Simpsons double their money back. With a fresh sense of family unity, they use the money to buy a new television set.|$|E

50|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>shock</b> {{drowning}} is a {{cause of}} death that occurs when swimmers are exposed to electric currents in the water.

The main cause of <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> drownings is faulty wiring on boats or docks that causes electric current to leak into the water. <b>Electric</b> <b>shock</b> drownings occur almost exclusively in freshwater. When stray currents exist in saltwater, the water itself diverts most of the current around the body due to the water's low resistance.|$|R
