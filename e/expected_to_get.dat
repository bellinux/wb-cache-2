5|$|Defensively, Iowa State was led {{by three}} players who {{achieved}} first team all-conference honors: senior defensive lineman Jake McDonough and senior linebackers Jake Knott and A.J. Klein. Knott recorded over 10 tackles in five games while Klein achieved that feat four times. Iowa State was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> both safety Durrell Givens and defensive back Jansen Watson back from injury for the game. The remainder of the Cyclone secondary was rounded out by senior Jeremy Reeves and junior Jacques Washington. Coming into the game, Iowa State ranked 59th {{in the nation in}} pass defense efficiency and 69th nationally in run defense.|$|E
5|$|On 31 August 2010, Corinthians {{announced}} {{the construction of}} the stadium with an estimated cost of R$335million and an expected gross revenue of R$100million per year. The original plans allow for an expansion to 70,000 seats. The club <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> financing from BNDES and sell the naming rights for the stadium to pay for the construction costs. The main architect of the project was Aníbal Coutinho; he was assisted by Antônio Paulo Cordeiro from Coutinho, Diegues, Cordeiro (DDG), partnering with Werner Sobek, who rendered structural engineering services. The stadium was planned to be completed by March 2013.|$|E

5|$|Diaby {{is often}} {{described}} as being injury-prone. Since returning from his fractured ankle injury in late 2006, the midfielder has endured persistent niggling injuries that have resulted in Diaby failing to play a full season for his current club. During his second season at Auxerre, a season in which he was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some significant playing time, Diaby failed to gain the confidence of manager Jacques Santini primarily due to repetitive injuries he endured during the Autumn portion of the 2005–06 season. After returning to the team, Diaby struggled to return to form, which ultimately resulted in his sale to Arsenal. His highest output for appearances with Arsenal came in the 2009–10 season when he played in 40 matches. Arsenal played a total of 55 competitive matches in the season.|$|E

25|$|Sea {{levels are}} <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{up to one}} meter higher by 2100, though this {{projection}} is disputed. A rise in the sea level would result in an agricultural land loss, in particular {{in areas such as}} South East Asia. Erosion, submergence of shorelines, salinity of the water table due to the increased sea levels, could mainly affect agriculture through inundation of low-lying lands.|$|E

Assuming the landing site could be non-solid, Huygens was designed to survive the impact, splash down on a liquid surface on Titan, and send back data for several minutes under these conditions. If that occurred it was expected to be the first time a human-made probe would land in an extraterrestrial ocean. The spacecraft had no more than three hours of battery life, most of which was planned to be used during the descent. Engineers <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> at most only 30 minutes of data from the surface.|$|E

With the series square, England needed 256 to win and were <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them, but Benaud, by bowling his leg breaks round the wicket into some rough created by footmarks, took 6-70 to secure an Australian victory by 54 runs. The key moment came when he bowled the England captain Peter May behind his legs for a duck. The bemused May had to be told by Aussie keeper Wally Grout that he had been bowled.|$|E

25|$|As a girl, {{her last}} {{idea was to}} spend her life in India, even though {{it might be the}} Scudder family tradition. As a child in India, she saw all too much famine, poverty and disease. After a Massachusetts seminary, Ida <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> married and settle down in the U.S., but, in her early 20s, Ida Scudder went back to India to help her ailing mother at her mission {{bungalow}} at Tindivanam. Ida Scudder took her M.D. at Cornell University in 1899, then headed back to India, fortified with a $10,000 gift from a Manhattan banker. With the money, she started a tiny clinic for women at Vellore, 75 miles from Madras. In two years she treated 5,000 patients.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the launch}} of mass {{production}} plug-in hybrids, conversion kits and services were available in the United States to convert production model hybrid electric vehicles to plug-ins. The regular Toyota Prius has been commercially converted, using these aftermarket kits and tax incentives, to a plug-in hybrid by CalCars {{and a number of}} third-party companies. On a smaller scale, PHEVs have been sold as commercial passenger vans, utility trucks, general and school buses, motorcycles, scooters, and military vehicles. Hybrid Electric Vehicle Technologies, Inc converts diesel buses to plug-in hybrids, under contract for the Chicago Transit Authority. Fisher Coachworks is developing a plug-in hybrid, the Fisher GTB-40, which is <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> about twice the mileage of a regular hybrid electric bus.|$|E
25|$|The next psychic {{claimed to}} be able to read auras around people. He claimed that auras were visible at least five inches above each of them. He {{selected}} ten people who he said had clearly visible auras. They were to stand behind screens and he claimed that their auras would be visible above the screens, which were numbered 1 through 10, and the subjects were told by the astrologer behind which screen to stand. He was to tell whether or not a person was standing behind each screen, by seeing their aura above. Since random guessing would be <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> about five correct, the psychic needed to get eight of the ten right. The psychic stated that he saw an aura over all ten screens, but people were behind only four of the screens.|$|E

25|$|Thayer {{reviewed}} Order 49, dated 30 December 1826 {{and signed}} by Chief of Engineer Macomb, ordering a court of inquiry to be assembled {{as soon as possible}} to investigate the Christmas riots. No deadline was given by the War Department in Washington, DC, though the academy was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it done as soon as possible. Major Worth was president of the inquiry, with Lieutenant Henry H. Gird acting as secretary (court reporter), and two other faculty and staff to be selected by Thayer for court duties. If the inquiry determined that further disciplinary action was necessary, Thayer was empowered to court-martial any cadet or other military personnel. Worth elected Hitchcock and Lieutenant William Bryant to the court, despite Hitchcock's involvement in controlling the riots in North Barracks.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the highly}} {{variable}} climatic regimes across the Great Plains, {{many aspects of}} climate change {{are not expected to}} affect all areas of the ecoregion equally. In regards to precipitation, this means an exacerbation of extremes where dry areas in the south are <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> drier and wetter areas in the north to get wetter. In turn this will increase the intensity of already problematic droughts across the region as well as creating the potential for flooding in the wetter north. The percent change in precipitation for both areas is dependent upon different emission scenarios; with higher emission levels in the future being conducive to greater extremes. Dramatic increases in average annual temperature are also expected, with average winter temperatures already having risen 7°F in the past 30 years. These increased temperatures are expected to cause warmer winters with warmer springs as well as hotter summers in the south-central plains.|$|E
25|$|Bear, {{like all}} of the cutters on the Bering Sea Patrol, had dealt with the {{problems}} of pelagic sealing for years by other nations ships in the coastal waters of Alaska. The problem was <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> worse after the Russo-Japanese War ended and Japan turned its resources back to peacetime uses because Japan was not a signatory to any sealing treaties. During the summer of 1908, Bertholf and his crew were kept very busy; they confiscated two Japanese ships caught sealing within the three-mile limit, and had to transport the ships and crews to Unalaska and testify in federal court. After the trial, Bear was tasked with hauling the prisoners to jail in Valdez, Alaska and didn't make a return to its homeport in Sausalito, California until late November. Other assignments during the three-year tour of duty that Bertholf commanded Bear included hydrographic surveys, shipwreck rescues and transporting 143 destitute men and women from Nome to Seattle. This required a refit of the cutter to accommodate the extra passengers.|$|E
