25|$|Tomari is very {{athletic}} and competitive, so {{in high school}} she joined the track and field club. In contrast to Hazumu and Yasuna who are not athletes and rather feminine, Tomari is a tomboy who does not often partake in traditionally feminine things such as clothing, shopping, or cosmetics. In her entire life, Tomari never wore a yukata during the annual summer festival, and has to borrow on old one from her mother when she finally does wear one during the summer festival shortly after Hazumu's transformation. At least two of Tomari's female friends on the track team consider her very masculine, and like <b>her</b> <b>cool</b> character; one of these friends even says that if Tomari were a boy {{that she would have}} a huge crush on her. Unlike Yasuna, Tomari has a lot of difficulty when it comes to her affection towards Hazumu, but still ends up with her.|$|E

She also praised the lead pair's performance writing that [...] "Ranbir Kapoor is suitably restrained and, at times, {{in keeping with his}} reticent character, often overshadowed by Priyanka's exuberance.

500|$|In Hollywood, Kerr's British {{accent and}} manner {{led to a}} {{succession}} of roles portraying refined, reserved, and [...] "proper" [...] English ladies. Kerr, nevertheless, used any opportunity to discard <b>her</b> <b>cool</b> exterior. She starred in the 1950 adventure film King Solomon's Mines, shot on location in Africa with Stewart Granger and Richard Carlson. This was immediately followed by her appearance in the religious epic Quo Vadis? (1951), shot at Cinecittà in Rome, in which she played the indomitable Lygia, a first-century Christian. She then played Princess Flavia in a remake of The Prisoner of Zenda (1952). In 1953, Kerr [...] "showed her theatrical mettle" [...] as Portia in Joseph Mankiewicz's Julius Caesar. She then departed from typecasting with a performance that brought out her sensuality, as [...] "Karen Holmes", the embittered military wife in Fred Zinnemann's From Here to Eternity (1953), for which she received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. The American Film Institute acknowledged the iconic status of the scene from that film in which Burt Lancaster and she romped illicitly and passionately amidst crashing waves on a Hawaiian beach. The organisation ranked it 20th in its list of the 100 most romantic films of all time.|$|E

500|$|Aaliyah's songs {{have been}} said to have [...] "crisp production" [...] and [...] "staccato arrangements" [...] that [...] "extend genre boundaries" [...] while {{containing}} [...] "old-school" [...] soul music. Kelefah Sanneh of The New York Times called Aaliyah [...] "a digital diva who wove a spell with ones and zeroes", and writes that her songs comprised [...] "simple vocal riffs, repeated and refracted to echo the manipulated loops that create digital rhythm", as Timbaland's [...] "computer-programmed beats fitted perfectly with <b>her</b> <b>cool,</b> breathy voice {{to create a new}} kind of electronic music." [...] When she experimented with other genres on Aaliyah, such as Latin pop and heavy metal, Entertainment Weeklys Craig Seymour panned the attempt. While Analyzing her eponymous [...] album British publication NME (New Musical Express) felt that Aaliyah's radical third album was intended to consolidate her position as U.S.R's most experimental artist. As her albums progressed, writers felt that Aaliyah matured, calling her progress a [...] "declaration of strength and independence". ABC News noted that Aaliyah's music was evolving from the punchy pop influenced Hip hop [...] and R to a more mature, introspective sound on her third album. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described her eponymous album, Aaliyah, as [...] "a statement of maturity and a stunning artistic leap forward" [...] and called it one of the strongest urban soul records of its time. She portrayed [...] "unfamiliar sounds, styles and emotions", but managed to please critics with the contemporary sound it contained. Ernest Hardy of Rolling Stone felt that Aaliyah reflected a stronger technique, where she gave her best vocal performance. Prior to her death, Aaliyah expressed a desire to learn about the burgeoning UK garage scene she had heard about at the time.|$|E

2500|$|In many ways, {{the book}} is fairly typical for a Regency romance, in that it focuses heavily on manners and {{societal}} expectations.
