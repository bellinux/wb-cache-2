40|$|This paper {{describes}} a Scottish initiative (arising {{out of a}} EU funded development project) involving university researchers, a local authority curriculum development officer {{and a group of}} teachers interested in developing more inquiry based approaches in science education. The project is not one in which the researchers bring prescriptions from research. Rather, it is seen as a joint effort aimed at solving practitioners' conceptual and practice issues. The overall question for the teachers was, <b>How</b> <b>do</b> I (<b>we)</b> <b>make</b> our practice more inquiry based? The question for the researchers was, <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> help you (the interested science teachers) to make your practice more inquiry based? This has two sub-questions: <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> help you to conceptualise the issues? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> help you to solve the practice problems? As it turned out, the particular group of teachers <b>we</b> worked with <b>did</b> not ask for help with practice issues, so we have not made much progress in answering the second question. Therefore, this paper will focus on the first. We seem to have been successful in helping the teachers to acquire some useful conceptual tools for thinking about and changing their practice in ways that they valued for themselves. Perhaps the answer to the second question is that researchers can help teachers to solve their practice problems by helping them to conceptualise the issues...|$|R

In place of his ringing call for a more equitable society was a package of proposals that constitute a blueprint for the remainder of his presidency. Some would require legislation; others merely an executive order." [...] The speech was dominated by domestic issues such as debt & deficit reduction, infrastructure measures, the economy and need to reinvigorate the middle class, gun control, minimum wage, early education and immigration. Obama declared [...] "Together, we have cleared away the rubble of crisis, and we can say with renewed confidence that the state of our union is stronger." [...] But despite this Obama noted that it is now his generation's task to [...] "reignite the true engine of America’s economic growth — a rising, thriving middle class."

[...] He also stated that the original 1933 look was the inspiration for the design saying, [...] We sort of went back to the 1933 version in the sense that he’s a bipedal creature that walks in an upright position, as opposed to the anthropomorphic, anatomically correct silverback gorilla that walks on all fours. Our Kong was intended to say, like, this isn’t just a big gorilla or a big monkey. This is something that is its own species. It has its own set of rules, so we can do what we want and we really wanted to pay homage to what came before…and yet do something completely different, and If anything, our Kong is meant to be a throwback to the ’33 version. I don’t think there’s much similarity at all between our version and Peter Jackson’s Kong. That version is very much a scaled-up silverback gorilla, and ours is something that is slightly more exaggerated. A big mandate for us was, <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> this feel like a classic movie monster?

He wrote and wrote and wrote to that loop. That was one song he expressed to me like, ‘we got to make this worthy of an album.’ You can’t just have an eight-minute song. [...] The track [...] "Ville Mentality" [...] features a spoken interlude performed by a young girl. The girl was recorded by Cole while visiting and speaking with kids at an elementary school in his hometown, Fayetteville, North Carolina. The foundation for the track [...] "For Whom the Bell Tolls" [...] was produced by New York University student Elijah Scarlett, Dreamville president Ibrahim Hamad discovered the beat on SoundCloud in January 2016 and reached out to Scarlett. Cole provided co-production, Nico Segal, Anthony Ware, and Theo Croker added horns, while duo Chargaux added strings. 4 Your Eyez Only is Scarlett's first major production credit, having previously only collaborating with friends. Producer Cardiak with help from Frank Dukes created the beat for the track [...] "Immortal" [...] with Cole in mind shortly {{after the release of}} Cole's previous album, 2014 Forest Hills Drive. In an interview with XXL [...] magazine Cardiak said, [...] "You know I was just always working on stuff for J. Cole. I had a idea of like the type of tracks he wanted, the sound and all that. I was just crafting a couple tracks. Shortly after 2014 Forest Hills Drive came out, I sent that beat over and he liked it and he told me to put it to the side and here we are today." [...] Classical string duo Chargaux are credited on seven of the album's ten tracks, and were on many of the songs that got cut. They previously collaborated with Cole on the track [...] "St. Tropez" [...] from 2014 Forest Hills Drive. They provided string arrangements, background vocals and addition production on 4 Your Eyez Only. Similar to his previous album, 4 Your Eyez Only contains no features, other than Dreamville signee Ari Lennox who provided additional vocals on the track [...] "Change". Ibrahim Hamad (Cole's manager) spoke on it saying: [...] "Cole's never gonna force anything. He's not the guy that's out, hanging out with rappers or in the studio with rappers all day. He's really in the studio with his team and making music with his producers and his artists. He's done songs with other people involved but it might not make the album. artist Ari Lennox's voice made the album on [...] "Change" [...] because she came in, added something to it and it worked. If it doesn't work, Cole's not gonna put it on there because it's a name. He's never gonna put it on there just to say he got a feature." [...] He continued saying, [...] "He also didn't go into it like, [...] "I'm gonna have no features on this album." [...] He didn't go into Forest Hills Drive initially saying he was gonna have no features. That's just how it ended up. At the end of the day, {{the most important thing to}} him and to all of us is how do we get this point that we're trying to get through and <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> the best version of a song?".|$|E

When it is the Object which embodies the research, the two fundamental questions are. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> elicit this information? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> record and <b>make</b> accessible? The aim of the exhibition was to visualise and articulate the complex, multi-faceted and often non-linear creative journey that individual researchers make to get to the final object.

By presenting a range of tangible textual and non-textual material, Beneath the Skin aimed to elicit and reveal the knowledge embodied by the object and proposed that there are intangible aspects within creative research that are not possible to quantify.
