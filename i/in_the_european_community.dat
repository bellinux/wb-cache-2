5|$|Barn owls are {{relatively}} common {{throughout most of}} their range and not considered globally threatened. However, locally severe declines from organochlorine (e.g., DDT) poisoning in the mid-20th century and rodenticides in the late 20th century have affected some populations, particularly in Europe and North America. Intensification of agricultural practices often means that the rough grassland that provides the best foraging habitat is lost. While barn owls are prolific breeders and able to recover from short-term population decreases, {{they are not as}} common in some areas as they used to be. A 1995–1997 survey put their British population at between 3,000 and 5,000 breeding pairs, out of an average of about 150,000 pairs in the whole of Europe. In the USA, barn owls are listed as endangered species in seven Midwestern states, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> they are considered a Species of European Concern.|$|E

25|$|For the {{political}} level, measures of innovation are {{more focused on}} {{a country or region}} competitive advantage through innovation. In this context, organizational capabilities can be evaluated through various evaluation frameworks, such as those of the European Foundation for Quality Management. The OECD Oslo Manual (1995) suggests standard guidelines on measuring technological product and process innovation. Some people consider the Oslo Manual complementary to the Frascati Manual from 1963. The new Oslo manual from 2005 takes a wider perspective to innovation, and includes marketing and organizational innovation. These standards are used for example <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Community</b> Innovation Surveys.|$|E

EUCC was invited by the European Commission to join the EU ICZM Expert Group; Dr. Alan Pickaver was EUCC’s representative in this expert group until August 2013. As a result, a novel means for Member States to measure the progress they are making on ICZM implementation through the use of indicators was developed. This method was presented to the Working Group on Indicators and data and accepted by the Group of Experts in 2006.|$|E

2500|$|Eyewear {{is rated}} for optical density (OD), {{which is the}} base-10 {{logarithm}} of the attenuation factor by which the optical filter reduces beam power. [...] For example, eyewear with OD3 will reduce the beam power in the specified wavelength range {{by a factor of}} 1000. In addition to an optical density sufficient to reduce beam power to below the maximum permissible exposure (see above), laser eyewear used where direct beam exposure is possible should be able to withstand a direct hit from the laser beam without breaking. The protective specifications (wavelengths and optical densities) are usually printed on the goggles, generally {{near the top of the}} unit. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Community,</b> manufacturers are required by European standard EN 207 to specify the maximum power rating rather than the optical density.|$|E
