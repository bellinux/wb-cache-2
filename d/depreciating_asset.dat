50|$|One {{thing to}} {{consider}} with personal finance and net worth goals is depreciating assets. A <b>depreciating</b> <b>asset</b> is an asset that loses value over time or with use. A few examples {{would be the}} vehicle that a person owns, boats, and capitalized expenses. They add value to a person's life but unlike other assets they do not make money and should be a class of their own. In the business world, for tax and bookkeeping purposes, these are depreciated over time {{due to the fact}} that their useful life runs out. This is known as accumulated deprecation and the asset will eventually need to be replaced.|$|E
5000|$|Such assets {{represent}} {{a serious problem}} for purchasers because of their complexity. Having been repackaged perhaps several times, it is difficult and time-consuming for auditors and accountants to determine their true value. As the recession of 2008-09 bit, their value decreased further as more debtors defaulted, so they represented a rapidly <b>depreciating</b> <b>asset.</b> Even those assets that might have gone up in value in the long-term depreciated rapidly, quickly becoming [...] "toxic" [...] for the banks that held them. Toxic assets, by increasing the variance of banks' assets, can turn otherwise healthy institutions into zombies. Potentially insolvent banks made too few good loans creating a debt overhang problem. Alternatively, potentially insolvent banks with toxic assets sought out very risky speculative loans to shift risk onto their depositors and other creditors.|$|E
40|$|I {{study the}} effects of {{inflation}} on the purchasing behavior of buyers in an economy where money is essential for certain transactions (as in Lagos and Wright, 2005). I show that higher inflation induces buyers to search for transactions more intensively and buy goods of worse quality to avoid holding for a prolonged period of time a fast <b>depreciating</b> <b>asset</b> like money. The standard framework fails to capture this kind of effect and the modification proposed in this paper sheds new light on the connection between the search and the inventory models of money...|$|E

40|$|Housing is a <b>depreciating</b> <b>asset.</b> The rate of {{depreciation}} {{depends on}} {{the degree to which}} households engage in housing investments. Housing investment expenditures economy-wide are sizable, averaging 45 percent of the value of new home construction over the past twenty years. The housing bust and recession coincided with a significant decline in housing investment. Using Consumer Expenditure Survey data from 2007 to 2012, we find that negative equity households reduce their housing investments by roughly 75 percent. The large increase in negative equity due to declining housing prices during the housing bust resulted in a cumulative decline of housing investment expenditures from 2006 to 2010 of $ 51. 2 billion...|$|E
40|$|China {{embarked}} on outward FDI (OFDI) {{with the advent}} of economic reforms in 1979 {{but it was not until}} 2000 that Chinese OFDI began to grow significantly. By that year, the Chinese government proposed a new national strategy, “Go global” and issued several policy incentives, including simplified procedures for government approval of investments, encouragement of state-owned banks to provide funding for OFDI, and tax incentives for OFDI (Yu & Jiao, 2011). As a result, FDI surged. In recent years, China has challenged the stereotype of being an exporter of cheap products by embarking on massive foreign direct investment (FDI) in both developing and developed countries. And the European Union (EU) is one of the most favored destinations (Hanemann & Huotari, 2015). Especially after 2008, Chinese FDI in EU started to increase rapidly partly fueled by the Eurozone debt crisis which, inter alia, led to <b>depreciating</b> <b>asset</b> prices in the EU (Ma & Overbeek, 2015) ...|$|E
40|$|This report {{explores the}} {{movement}} of average prices and price changes for single-unit houses between 1970 and 1995 in three housing submarkets that radiate outward from downtown Minneapolis and downtown St. Paul. The report investigates one way of measuring gains and losses in housing values that might be traced in part to processes of economic growth, tax policy, and the outward movement of jobs, incomes, and the capital represented by housing assets. The report theorizes that these capital shifts {{are the result of}} the capitalized value of tax expenditures and property tax differentials between city and suburb, the impacts of utility pricing schemes, and the nature of consumer demand for housing. Additional factors that drive flux in this general pattern of outward movement of capital include energy and consumer price fluctuations, general economic conditions, significant inmigration, and perceptions about both public safety and school quality {{in different parts of the}} metropolitan region. The result of this dynamic is that some households realize unearned capital gains simply by virtue of their location, while others find themselves holding a <b>depreciating</b> <b>asset</b> due to factors beyond their control.

5000|$|Net {{domestic}} product accounts for capital {{that has been}} consumed over {{the year in the}} form of housing, vehicle, or machinery deterioration. The depreciation accounted for {{is often referred to as}} [...] "capital consumption allowance" [...] and represents the amount of capital that would be needed to replace those <b>depreciated</b> <b>assets.</b>|$|R
50|$|A further trap {{awaits the}} unwary U.S. {{investor}} who donates depreciated assets—assets on which {{there have been}} losses in value—to charity. The gift actually forfeit the tax deductibility of the capital losses, and only the depreciated (low) market value {{at the time of}} the gift is allowed to be deducted, rather than the higher basis. However an investor can instead sell the <b>depreciated</b> <b>assets</b> before considering a donation. An investor who sells can realize the resultant capital loss, which may then be deducted under the applicable capital loss rules. The cash proceeds after liquidating the <b>depreciated</b> <b>asset</b> may of course be donated to charity and deducted following the sale, but the tax advantages of making such donation are no better or worse than in any cash donation to charity. In any case, such a course leaves the investor more after-tax assets to donate if so inclined.|$|R

25|$|In business, {{fractional}} ownership is a percentage share of an expensive asset. Shares are sold to individual owners. Typically, a company manages the asset {{on behalf of}} the owners, who pay monthly/annual fees for the management plus variable (e.g., per-hour, per-day) use fees. For rapidly <b>depreciating</b> <b>assets,</b> the management company may sell the asset and distribute the proceeds back to the owners, who can then claim a capital loss and optionally purchase a fraction of a new asset.|$|R
5000|$|Cars {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{expensive}} <b>depreciating</b> <b>assets</b> people buy in their lives. It's a right of passage to adulthood when a person buys their first car, but many younger people can not usually afford a car. That's why people approach car financiers. Car Financiers lend money to allow accepted clients to purchase their next car sooner than they otherwise would, and work with the client to create a repayment plan. However interest rates do vary widely and arranging your own finance is often better.|$|R
50|$|The main {{drawback}} of ROCE is that {{it measures}} return against the {{book value of assets}} in the business. As these are depreciated the ROCE will increase even though cash flow has remained the same. Thus, older businesses with <b>depreciated</b> <b>assets</b> will tend to have higher ROCE than newer, possibly better businesses. In addition, while cash flow is affected by inflation, the book value of assets is not. Consequently, revenues increase with inflation while capital employed generally does not (as the book value of assets is not affected by inflation).|$|R
5000|$|The {{depreciation}} write-off permitted for {{tax purposes}} may also diverge from so-called [...] "economic depreciation" [...] or [...] "real" [...] depreciation rates. Economic depreciation rates are calculated {{on the basis}} of the observed average market prices that <b>depreciated</b> <b>assets</b> at different ages actually sell for. Sometimes statisticians try to estimate the average [...] "service lives" [...] of fixed assets as a basis for calculating depreciation and scrap values, based on the observed length of time that fixed assets are actually held and used by their owners who own the business.|$|R

50|$|Buying or leasing brand-new, {{expensive}} imported vehicles is poor value. Buying status {{objects such}} as branded consumer goods is a never-ending cycle of <b>depreciating</b> <b>assets.</b> Even {{when you get a}} good deal on premium items, if you choose to replace them frequently, the older items hold no value and have become a sunk cost.Living in a status neighbourhood is not only poor value, but you will feel the need to keep buying status objects to keep up with your neighbours, who are mostly UAWs. The authors make the point that Hyperconsumers must realize more income to afford luxury items and become more vulnerable to inflation and income tax.|$|R
50|$|If {{a company}} chooses to <b>depreciate</b> an <b>asset</b> at a {{different}} rate from that used by the tax office then this generates a timing difference in the income statement due to the difference (at a point in time) between the taxation department's and company's view of the profit.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a rationale for}} modelling physical depreciation under uncertainty and compares two variants of it. The first variant leads to a model, the 'gamma' model which has been discussed in the literature, while the second variant leads to a model, the 'binomial' model, {{which has not been}} investigated before. The binomial model is shown to approach a deterministic limit (the reducing balance method) as the <b>depreciated</b> <b>asset</b> becomes infinitely divisible. In contrast it has been demonstrated in the literature that the gamma model approaches a particular statistical distribution under these circumstances. The paper goes on to investigate the useful lives of assets under the two models, by reporting results on waiting times, none of which have appeared in the literature before.

40|$|This article {{develops}} a dynamic risk management model {{to determine a}} firm's optimal risk management strategy. This strategy has two elements. First, for low-leverage values, the firm fully hedges its operating cash flow exposure, due to the convexity of its cost of capital. When leverage exceeds a very high threshold, the firm gambles for resurrection and stops hedging. Second, the firm manages its capital structure through dividend distributions and investment. When leverage is low, the firm replaces <b>depreciated</b> <b>assets,</b> fully invests in opportunities if they arise, and distribute dividends, all of these together to achieve its optimal capital structure. As leverage increases, the firm stops paying dividends, while fully investing. After a certain leverage, the firm also reduces investment until it stops investing completely. The model predictions are consistent with empirical observation...|$|R
50|$|Since double-declining-balance {{depreciation}} {{does not}} always <b>depreciate</b> an <b>asset</b> fully by its end of life, some methods also compute a straight-line depreciation each year, and apply the greater of the two. This {{has the effect of}} converting from declining-balance depreciation to straight-line depreciation at a midpoint in the asset's life.|$|R

This {{is not the best}} treatment of an intangible whose actual life is much shorter than fifteen years. Furthermore, if an intangible is not eligible for amortization under § 197, the taxpayer can <b>depreciate</b> the <b>asset</b> if there is a showing of the assets useful life.|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of 2002 and 2003, the Australian Government {{introduced}} a fundamental change to the taxation of corporate groups. The new tax consolidation legislation allows wholly-owned groups {{to be regarded as}} one homogenous entity for income tax purposes from 1 st of July 2002. After making an irrevocable decision to implement the elective consolidation provisions, a group, consisting of a head company and at least one other wholly-owned entity (company, trust or partnership), lodges a single income tax return and pays a single set of PAYG instalments over the period of consolidation. The assessment of the policies, principles and rules governing the implementation and operation of the consolidation regime reveals far-reaching implications for the accessibility of tax attributes and changes to the tax cost / adjusted values of capital / <b>depreciating</b> <b>assets.</b> Tax accounting systems and corporate governance guidelines established by groups are also affected. This thesis identifies and analyses the areas of taxation, accounting and corporate governance which are relevant for the initial consolidation decision...|$|R
5000|$|Capital {{formation}} is notoriously {{difficult to measure}} statistically, {{mainly because of the}} valuation problems involved in establishing what the value of capital assets is. When a fixed asset or inventory is bought, it may be reasonably clear what its market value is, namely the purchaser's price. But as soon as it is bought, its value may change, and it may change even before it is put to use. Things often become more complicated to measure when a new fixed asset is acquired within some kind of lease agreement. Finally, {{the rate at which the}} value of the fixed <b>asset</b> <b>depreciates</b> will affect the gross and net valuation of the asset, yet different methods are typically used to value what assets are worth and how fast they <b>depreciate.</b> Capital <b>assets</b> can for instance be valued at: ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model to}} analyze the upside potential of profitability of the SAREB (“Asset Management Company for Assets Arising from Bank Restructuring”), the Spanish “Bad Bank”. The model is based in the Real Options methodology, that is especially adequate due to the convergence of two elements, (i) <b>depreciated</b> <b>assets</b> with a high upside potential, and (ii) a highly volatile market as it has shown {{to be the real}} estate Spanish market. Our results suggest that the SAREB has a higher than expected profitability potentialthat would be dedicated to increase the return to its shareholders, mainly private banks. Consequently we also show that after the financial crisis are emerging two types of banks in Spain, in one hand the losers who are transferring their real estate assets at a deep discount, and in the other hand the winners, capturing the upside potential of those assets as shareholders of SAREB, and consequently consolidating their strength in the Spanish Real Estate Industry. It is worth to mention that Governments should make an effort in properly redistribute the wealth generated by the real Estate industry...|$|R
50|$|Tax {{deductions}} for depreciation {{have been allowed}} in the U.S. {{since the inception of}} the income tax. Prior to 1971, these deductions could be computed in a variety of manners over a wide range of lives, under old Bulletin F. In 1971, Congress introduced the Class Life Asset Depreciation Range (ADR) system in an attempt to simplify calculations and provide some uniformity. Under ADR, the IRS prescribed lives for classes of assets based on the nature or use of the asset. Such classes included general classes (such as office equipment) and industry classes (such as assets used in the manufacture of rubber goods). Taxpayers could use their choice of several methods of <b>depreciating</b> <b>assets,</b> including straight line, declining balance, and sum of years digits. Asset costs and accumulated depreciation were tracked by “vintage accounts” consisting of all assets within a class acquired in a particular tax year. All vintage accounts for the same year were assumed placed in service {{in the middle of the}} year; however, a taxpayer could elect the modified half year convention with potentially favorable results.|$|R

40|$|A company's profit {{after tax}} (or net income) is quite an {{arbitrary}} figure, obtained after assuming certain accounting hypotheses regarding expenses and revenues. On the other hand, its cash flow is an objective measure, a single figure that {{is not subject to}} any personal criterion. In general, to study a company's situation, it is more useful to operate with the cash flow (equity cash flow, free cash flow or capital cash flow) as it is a single figure, while the net income is one of several that can be obtained, depending on the criteria applied. Profit after tax (PAT) is equal to the equity cash flow when the company is not growing, buys fixed assets for an amount identical to depreciation, keeps debt constant, and only writes off or sells fully <b>depreciated</b> <b>assets.</b> Profit after tax (PAT) is also equal to the equity cash flow when the company collects in cash, pays in cash, holds no stock (this company's working capital requirements are zero), and buys fixed assets for an amount identical to depreciation.

40|$|Applications of {{the real}} options {{approach}} hardly consider investment returns {{to be the result}} of competitive markets such as markets for agricultural products. The reason is probably that Dixit and Pindyck (1994, ch. 8) show in their very popular book "Investment under Uncertainty" that the investment triggers of firms in competitive markets are equal to those of firms with exclusive options. In this study, however, it is shown that this result is restricted to markets in which assets have infinite lifetime. If assets are subject to depreciation and subsequent reinvestment opportuni-ties, competition leads to significantly lower investment triggers. The reason is that depreciation of replaceable assets allows to compensate the potential decline in returns after negative demand shocks because of the non-replacement of <b>depreciated</b> <b>assets.</b> Accordingly, applications {{of the real}} options approach to investments in e. g. pig production should consider this effect. The results are obtained by an agent-based simulation approach in which a number of competing firms derive their investment triggers by a genetic algorithm. Since this method allows to understand the re-sulting price dynamics, an alternative method is presented that allows to simulate the identified price dynamics directly and which also can be used to determine investment triggers for specific conditions.

40|$|The General Utilities {{doctrine}} {{is the name}} given to the now largely defunct tax rule that a corporation does not recognize a gain or a loss on making a liquidating or nonliquidating distribution of an appreciated or <b>depreciated</b> <b>asset</b> to its shareholders. The roots of the doctrine, {{can be traced to}} a regulation promulgated in 1919 that denied realization of gain or loss to a corporation when making a liquidating distribution of an asset in kind. No regulatory provision existed which specified the extent to which realization would or would not be triggered by a nonliquidating distribution such as a dividend or a stock redemption. In General Utilities 2 ̆ 6 Operating Co. v. Helvering, a the Supreme Court adopted a nonrecognition rule for dividend distributions that are made in kind. In deference to that decision, the rule for nonrecognition of gain or loss on a liquidating or a nonliquidating corporate distribution of property in kind has been commonly referred to as the General Utilities doctrine. Congress codified the doctrine in the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. With few exceptions, the original provisions of the Code provided that a distributing corporation did not recognize a gain or loss on making a distribution in kind...|$|R
40|$|In my thesis, I {{analysed}} {{the sources}} of financing the communal infrastructure in the municipality of Sevnica. The analysis focused on the communal infrastructure {{for the implementation of}} mandatory municipal utility services, regarding waste management, treatment and discharge of waste water, and drinking water supply. From the quantitative standpoint, the analysis covers the 2010 to 2013 period. I described the importance of communal supply as a foundation {{for the development of the}} society and local community; I also presented two public utility service providers in the municipality of Sevnica and some of the features of the implementation of communal services in the aforementioned municipality. Each source was defined at the municipal and state level by its own laws and regulations. The problem of obtaining funds from the communal fee and amortisation was more specifically described. Both of these sources’ theoretical significance was explored, along with the levying system in the municipality of Sevnica. I considered several possible methods for improvement. I also highlighted the importance of obtaining <b>depreciated</b> <b>assets,</b> as well as revaluation of fixed assets. In my analysis, the specifics of the municipality of Sevnica were taken into account, as it is a highly rural area, which greatly affects the amount and the process of obtaining the necessary funds for possible investments in communal infrastructure...|$|R
