5|$|AIDS {{was first}} {{clinically}} observed in 1981 in the United States. The initial cases were {{a cluster of}} <b>injection</b> <b>drug</b> users and gay men with no known cause of impaired immunity who showed symptoms of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), a rare opportunistic infection that was known to occur in people with very compromised immune systems. Soon thereafter, additional gay men developed a previously rare skin cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Many more cases of PCP and KS emerged, alerting U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a CDC task force was formed to monitor the outbreak. The earliest retrospectively described case of AIDS {{is believed to have}} been in Norway beginning in 1966.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{method of}} {{transmission}} reflects {{the prevalence of}} chronic HBV infection in a given area. In low prevalence {{areas such as the}} continental United States and Western Europe, <b>injection</b> <b>drug</b> abuse and unprotected sex are the primary methods, although other factors may also be important. In moderate prevalence areas, which include Eastern Europe, Russia, and Japan, where 2–7% of the population is chronically infected, the disease is predominantly spread among children. In high-prevalence areas such as China and South East Asia, transmission during childbirth is most common, although in other areas of high endemicity such as Africa, transmission during childhood is a significant factor. The prevalence of chronic HBV infection in areas of high endemicity is at least 8% with 10–15% prevalence in Africa/Far East. As of 2010, China has 120 million infected people, followed by India and Indonesia with 40 million and 12 million, respectively. According to World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 600,000 people die every year related to the infection.|$|E

25|$|Some {{groups are}} {{especially}} vulnerable to human rights abuses collateral to drug law enforcement. Specifically in Northern Border states that have seen elevated levels of drug-related violence, human rights violations of <b>injection</b> <b>drug</b> users (IDUs) and sex workers by law enforcement personnel include physical and sexual violence, extortion, and targeting for accessing or possession of injection equipment or practicing sex work, although these activities are legal. Such targeting is especially deleterious because members of these marginalized communities often lack the resources and social or political capital to vindicate their rights.|$|E

25|$|The {{distribution}} of naloxone to <b>injection</b> <b>drug</b> users and other opioid drug users decreases {{the risk of}} death from overdose. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that U.S. programs for drug users and their caregivers prescribing take-home doses of naloxone and training on its utilization are estimated to have prevented 10,000 opioid overdose deaths. Healthcare institution-based naloxone prescription programs have also helped reduce rates of opioid overdose in the U.S. state of North Carolina, and have been replicated in the U.S. military. Nevertheless, scale-up of healthcare-based opioid overdose interventions is limited by providers' insufficient knowledge and negative attitudes towards prescribing take-home naloxone to prevent opioid overdose. Programs training police and fire personnel in opioid overdose response using naloxone have also shown promise in the US.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. The Health Centre of Novi Sad deals {{primarily}} with prevention, but also provides curative health care. This paper {{was aimed at}} investigating trends {{in the use of}} <b>injection</b> <b>drugs</b> in out-patients visiting this institution in the period from 2005 to 2009. Material and Methods. The use of <b>injection</b> <b>drugs</b> was calculated according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical/Defined Daily Doses methodology. The results were expressed as the number of defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants/day. Results and Discussion. The total use of <b>injection</b> <b>drugs</b> was 21. 2696 defined daily doses / 1000 inhabitants/day in 2005, 31. 8427 defined daily doses / 1000 inhabitants/day in 2006, 36. 0633 defined daily doses / 1000 inhabitants/ day in 2007, 34. 4823 defined daily doses / 1000 inhabitants/ day in 2008 and 26. 2189 defined daily doses / 1000 inhabitants/ day in 2009. The drug with the highest number of defined daily doses was hydroxocobolamin during all five years (accounting for about 90 % {{of the total number of}} defined daily doses). In the observed period, the use of low molecular weight heparins increased from 0. 0599 in 2005 to 0. 2705 in 2009. The use of anti-infective drugs decreased from 0. 6133 in 2005 to 0. 2634 in 2009. A change in the structure of use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was observed. Conclusion. The total use of injections in the observed period showed annual oscillations. The trend of use of low molecular weight heparins and the qualitative change in use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was in accordance with the trend and the use in developed countries, while the use of hydroxocobolamin and gentamicin increased. The promotion of oral medications and the reduced prescription of <b>injection</b> <b>drugs</b> are the possibilities to be taken into consideration, especially in the use of hydroxocobolamin...|$|R

50|$|On October 13, 2014, the Oklahoma Attorney General {{said the}} state did not have {{adequate}} supply of execution drugs, and delayed the execution of Glossip and two other inmates.

2500|$|The CDC (2015) {{reported}} [...] {{that gay}} and bisexual men accounted for 82% (26,375 out of 1,242,000 adults and adolescents) of HIV diagnoses among males and 67% of all diagnoses in the United States, while six percent (2,392) of HIV diagnoses {{were attributed to}} <b>injection</b> <b>drug</b> use (IDU) and another 3% (1,202) to male-to-male sexual contact plus IDU. [...] Heterosexual contact accounted for 24% (9,339) of all HIV diagnoses.|$|E
2500|$|According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), {{patients}} stabilized on adequate, sustained {{doses of}} methadone or buprenorphine can keep their jobs, avoid crime and violence, and reduce {{their exposure to}} HIV and Hepatitis C by stopping or reducing <b>injection</b> <b>drug</b> use and drug-related high risk sexual behavior. Naltrexone is a long-acting opioid antagonist with few side effects. It is usually prescribed in outpatient medical conditions. [...] Naltrexone blocks the euphoric effects of alcohol and opiates. [...] Naltrexone cuts relapse risk during the first 3 months by about 36%. However, it is far less effective in helping patients maintain abstinence or retaining them in the drug-treatment system (retention rates average 12% at 90 days for naltrexone, average 57% at 90 days for buprenorphine, average 61% at 90 days for methadone).|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of [...] "spillover" [...] along the US-bound drug {{trafficking}} routes and more stringent border enforcement, Mexico's Northern Border states have seen increased levels of drug consumption and abuse, including elevated rates of drug injection 10 to 15 times the national average. These rates are accompanied by mounting rates of HIV and STIs among <b>injection</b> <b>drug</b> users (IDUs) and sex workers, reaching a 5.5% prevalence {{in cities such as}} Tijuana and Ciudad Juárez, which also report STI rates of 64% and 83%, respectively. Violence and extortion of IDUs and sex workers directly and indirectly elevate the levels of risk behavior and poor health outcomes among members of these groups. Marginalization of these vulnerable groups by way of physical and sexual violence and extortion by police threatens the cross-over of infection from high-prevalence groups to the general population. In particular, decreased access to public health services, such as syringe exchange programs, and confiscation of syringes, even in view of syringe access and possession being legal, can precipitate a cascade of health harms. Geographic diffusion of epidemics from the Northern Border states elsewhere is also possible with the rotation of police and military personnel stationed in drug conflict areas with high infection prevalence.|$|E

2500|$|In 2010, a {{nationwide}} shortage of the lethal <b>injection</b> <b>drug,</b> sodium thiopental, led the Oklahoma Department of Corrections to instead consider pentobarbital, which {{is commonly used}} for animal euthanasia. Oklahoma state law is not specific in prescribing {{the use of a}} fast-acting barbiturate, allowing flexibility for such a substitution. Duty and two other inmates on death row filed a federal appeal that the new protocol would constitute cruel and unusual punishment. In a hearing before the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, the professor of anesthesia from Harvard Medical School testified for the defense that pentobarbital might not succeed in preventing [...] "severe, excruciating pain". However, the professor of anesthesiology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst countered in a deposition for the state that 5grams of pentobarbital would be sufficient to cause unconsciousness and death in minutes. Representatives from the Oklahoma Department of Corrections and the Death Penalty Information Center both testified that no other state had used pentobarbital and that they believed Duty would be the first person to be executed by the drug. On December 14, 2010, the Circuit Judges Jerome Holmes and Neil Gorsuch joined Chief Judge Mary Beck Briscoe in a unanimous decision upholding the use of the drug, citing that the state witness had demonstrated [...] "substantially more clinical experience with the use of pentobarbital". A petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States over the constitutionality of the state's execution protocol was also denied.|$|E
