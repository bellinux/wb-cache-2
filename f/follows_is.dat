5|$|Overton was {{decorated}} numerous times during his Korean War tour, however {{many of these}} awards and medals were rescinded following his controversial removal from the country. Additionally, his records were among the 16 to 18 million which were destroyed in the 1973 National Archives fire. Most of Overton's decorations were restored following his 2009 appeal. What <b>follows</b> <b>is</b> an incomplete list of awards confirmed to have been awarded to Overton during his service.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{battle of}} Salamis {{is not well}} {{described}} by the ancient sources, and {{it is unlikely that}} anyone (other than perhaps Xerxes) involved in the battle had a clear idea what was happening across the width of the straits.

5|$|U.S. {{officials}} {{said there were}} 22 people in the compound. Five were killed, including Osama bin Laden. Pakistani officials gave conflicting reports suggesting between 12 and 17 survivors. The Sunday Times subsequently published excerpts from a pocket guide, presumably dropped by the SEALs during the raid, containing pictures and descriptions of likely compound residents. The guide listed several adult children of bin Laden and their families who were not ultimately found in the compound. Because {{of a lack of}} verifiable information, some of what <b>follows</b> <b>is</b> thinly sourced.|$|E

5|$|The list below {{includes}} all NK Maribor {{players who have}} made at least 100 official appearances for the club or who have been capped at full international level by their countries. The list is ordered {{by the number of}} appearances, then by goals scored. If the players are still tied, they are listed alphabetically. The first and last columns contain the year of the player's first and last senior appearance for Maribor. The seasons column counts those seasons in which the player made at least one official appearance. For the list of Maribor's active players, see current members of the club. The table that <b>follows</b> <b>is</b> accurate as {{of the end of the}} 2016â€“17 season.|$|E
5|$|In English a {{sentence}} may {{be composed of}} one or more clauses, that may in turn be composed {{of one or more}} phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb, and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within {{a sentence}} one clause is always the main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to it. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase I think (that) you are lying, the main clause is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause (that) you are lying. The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that <b>follows</b> <b>is</b> a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted. Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative clause that you received today specifies {{the meaning of the word}} letter, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted.) In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.|$|E
