This study reports molecular cytogenetic data showing quantifiable localized differences in condensation between homologs {{that are related}} to differences in accessibility (DA) of associated DNA probe targets. Reproducible DA was observed for ~ 10 % of locus-specific, short (1. 5 - 5 kb) single copy DNA probes used in fluorescence in situ hybridization. RESULTS: Fourteen probes (from chromosomes 1, 5, 9, 11, 15, 17, 22) targeting genic and intergenic regions were developed and hybridized to cells from 10 individuals with cytogenetically-distinguishable homologs. Differences in hybridization between homologs were non-random for 8 genomic regions (RGS 7, CACNA 1 B, GABRA 5, SNRPN, HERC 2, PMP 22 :IVS 3, ADORA 2 B:IVS 1, ACR) and were not unique to known imprinted domains or specific chromosomes. DNA probes within CCNB 1, C 9 orf 66, ADORA 2 B:Promoter-Ex 1, PMP 22 :IVS 4 -Ex 5, and intergenic region 1 p 36. 3 showed no DA (<b>equivalent</b> <b>accessibility),</b> while OPCML showed unbiased DA. To pinpoint probe locations, we performed 3 D-structured illumination microscopy (3 D-SIM). This showed that genomic regions with DA had 3. 3 -fold greater volumetric, integrated probe intensities and broad distributions of probe depths along axial and lateral axes of the 2 homologs, compared to a low copy probe target (NOMO 1) with <b>equivalent</b> <b>accessibility.</b> Genomic regions with <b>equivalent</b> <b>accessibility</b> were also enriched for epigenetic marks of open interphase chromatin (DNase I HS, H 3 K 27 Ac, H 3 K 4 me 1) {{to a greater extent than}} regions with DA. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that DA is non-random and reproducible; it is locus specific, but not unique to known imprinted regions or specific chromosomes. Non-random DA was also shown to be heritable within a 2 generation family. DNA probe volume and depth measurements of hybridized metaphase chromosomes further show locus-specific chromatin accessibility differences by super-resolution 3 D-SIM. Based on these data and the analysis of interphase epigenetic marks of genomic intervals with DA, we conclude that there are localized differences in compaction of homologs during mitotic metaphase and that these differences may arise during or preceding metaphase chromosome compaction. Our results suggest new directions for locus-specific structural analysis of metaphase chromosomes, motivated by the potential relationship of these findings to underlying epigenetic changes established during interphase...|$|E
40|$|Aristotle in the Organon (1949 : 9, 30 a, 15 - 19) {{explicitly}} {{states that}} in a categorical syllogism when the minor premise is absolute (without modality operator) and the major is necessary, the conclusion will be necessary too. This Aristotle's view has {{been the source of}} many conflicts and disputes in the history of logic. The famous logicians and historians of logic in the twentieth century as "Nicholas Rescher" and "Becker" believe that Aristotle's view is justifiable and defensible (at least compared to the first figure) only if, the modality of major premise is considered as the property of predicate (modality de re). Today, we know very well that the modality of predicate is closely linked to Metaphysical and philosophical Modality. “Shihab al-Din al- Suhrawardi” in the theory of "Decisive (Battateh) Necessity” by accepting this base, explicitly states that, in the beginning, the modality must be mentioned {{as a part of the}} predicate and then the modality of relation or copula is summarized and reduced to necessity. The modern formalization of the most important part of this theory is as follows: ("x) (àAx É à Bx) º ("x) □ (àAx É à Bx) This paper discusses the historical overview of the metaphysical modality firstly and then shows that the theory of "Decisive Necessity” is true and justified in a model of modal logic with <b>equivalent</b> <b>accessibility</b> relation and homogeneous possible world view (fixed domain) ...|$|E
40|$|The human mitotic {{metaphase}} chromosome {{is a product}} of complex chromatin restructuring during interphase. Metaphase chromosomes exhibit considerable plasticity in condensation. This is evident as distinct regions of accessible and compact chromatin fiber or epigenetic differences in histone and non-histone proteins. Such differences in chromatin condensation have been extensively described along the length of individual mitotic chromosomes but have not been recognized between homologous loci during metaphase. This thesis characterizes localized differences in condensation of homologous metaphase chromosomes that are related to differences in accessibility (DA) of associated DNA probe targets. Reproducible DA was observed for ~ 10 % of locus-specific, short (1. 5 - 5 kb) single copy (SC) DNA probes used in fluorescence in situ hybridization. To investigate the physical and structural organization of chromatin at locus-specific sites, we developed correlated atomic force and fluorescence microscopy imaging. Comparison of centromeric DNA and protein distribution patterns in fixed homologous chromosomes indicated that CENP-B and α-satellite DNA were distributed distinctly from one another and relative to observed centromeric ridge topography. At non-centromeic locations, short DNA probes that did not exhibit DA showed greater accessibility to the accessible chromatin topography on both homologs. Localized differential accessibility between chromosome homologs in metaphase was non-random and reproducible but not unique to known imprinted regions or specific chromosomes. Second, non-random DA was shown to be heritable within a 2 generation family. Third, DNA probe volume and depth measurements of hybridized metaphase chromosomes showed internal differences in chromatin accessibility of homologous regions by super-resolution 3 D-structured illumination microscopy. Finally, genomic regions with <b>equivalent</b> <b>accessibility</b> were enriched for epigenetic marks of open interphase chromatin {{to a greater extent than}} regions with DA, suggesting that observed structural differences in accessibility may arise during or preceding metaphase chromosome compaction. Inhibition of the topoisomerase IIα-DNA cleavage complex mitigated DA by decreasing DNA superhelicity and axial metaphase chromosome condensation. Inter-homolog probe intensity ratios, depth, and volume between chromosomes treated with a catalytic inhibitor of topoisomerase IIα, were equalized compared to untreated cells. These data altogether suggest that DA is a reflection of allelic differences in metaphase chromosome compaction, dictated by the catenation state of the chromosome...|$|E
40|$|Transportation systems {{exist to}} improve {{individual}} accessibility. However, emerging applications of GIS in transportation (GIS-T) and intelligent transportation system (ITS) focus on throughput (the amount of system flow) rather than accessibility. Throughput is related but not <b>equivalent</b> to <b>accessibility.</b> Sensitive transportation planning requires rigorous, realistic and tractable accessibility measures. This paper {{reports on the}} development of GIS software that implement space-time accessibility measures (STAMs). The STAMs reflect the benefits that individuals receive from the transportation system. They are easily interpreted, particularly with respect to changes in accessibility. The STAMs also consider the locations and travel velocities dictated by the transportation system as well as individuals' daily activity schedules. Tractable computational procedures allow calculation of the STAMs for detailed, urban-scale transportation networks. A prototype ArcInfo -linked software system that runs on Windows NT or Sun Solaris platform implements the STAMs with userfriendly interfaces and project management tools...|$|R

We examined whether this advantage for to-be-enacted material is reduced in older adults and thus whether attenuated action accessibility could underlie age-associated declines in prospective remembering. Young and older adults showed an <b>equivalent</b> increase in <b>accessibility</b> (faster recognition latencies) for to-be-enacted items over items intended for verbal report.

40|$|The {{first step}} in the aerobic {{microbial}} degradation of biphenyl and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) utilizes a short electron transfer chain to facilitate dioxygenase-catalyzed formation of a cis-dihydrodiol from the aromatic substrate. The electron transfer chain includes a ferredoxin reductase (BphG), a Rieske-type ferredoxin (BphF), and the ring-hydroxylating dioxygenase (BphA 1 A 2). This work will present the X-ray crystal structures of the ferredoxin from Burkholderia cepacia to 1. 6 Å resolution and the biphenyl dioxygenase from Comomonas testosteroni to 1. 5 Å resolution. The intrinsic Fe atoms provided MAD phasing information in both cases. ^ The structure of BphF is the first for a dioxygenase ferredoxin (Fd) and affords an opportunity for comparisons with Rieske subunits from other systems. The redox properties of dioxygenase Fds differ significantly from those of the Rieske proteins of the bc 1 (mitochondria) and b 6 f (chloroplast) complexes: the midpoint potentials of the former are ∼ 450 mV lower and are relatively independent of ionic strength and pH. It has previously been proposed that differences in the accessibility of the clusters are the cause of these variations, and that the Fe 2 S 2 cluster of the dioxygenase Fd was likely to be sequestered. Despite low sequence identity and variations in key segments of the cluster binding domain, BphF clearly shows a remarkable overall similarity to the bc 1 and b 6 f structures, and its Fe 2 S 2 cluster has <b>equivalent</b> solvent <b>accessibility.</b> Therefore, the differences in redox properties must arise from other factors. The BphF system enables a detailed study of the subtleties of protein control of redox potential. ^ BphA 1 A 2 is an α 3 β 3 hexamer. Each α-subunit binds one Rieske Fe 2 S 2 cluster and catalyzes ring-hydroxylation at a mono-nuclear, non-heme Fe(II) active site. A structural comparison of BphA 1 A 2 with that of naphthalene dioxygenase provides insight into key aspects of structure and catalysis. Additionally, this structure provides information to the debate surrounding the coordination geometry of the mononuclear Fe site that arose from contrasting results between the spectroscopically characterized phthalate dioxygenase and the structure of naphthalene dioxygenase. Moreover, the structure of BphA 1 A 2 can be used in conjunction with that of BphF to potentially identify features involved in protein-protein association and electron transfer. ...|$|R
