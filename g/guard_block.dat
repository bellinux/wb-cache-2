[...] The mountaintop position is unusual in having two 75mm gun turrets: due to restricted fields of fire, most Alpine ouvrages had their guns in casemates. [...] Mont Agel, with its commanding site, could make appropriate use of turreted guns. A 145mm gun turret was planned, but not built.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike other {{fighting}} {{games of}} the early 1990s (such as Street Fighter II or Mortal Kombat), the game relies on a control stick and only three buttons, Punch, Kick, and <b>Guard</b> (<b>block)</b> although different situations and button combinations led to a vast variety of moves for each character.|$|E

50|$|Styles {{and types}} of blocking, as well as terminology, vary widely among the various martial arts. In Japanese martial arts such as Karate, these {{techniques}} {{are referred to as}} uke waza. Examples include age uke (rising block) and shuto uke (knife hand <b>guarding</b> <b>block).</b> In Korean martial arts such as Taekwondo, these techniques are referred to as makgi(막기), with some examples being chukyeo makgi (rising block) and sonkal daebi makgi (knifehand <b>guarding</b> <b>block).</b> Some martial arts, such as Capoeira, reject blocking techniques completely as they consider them too inefficient. In Capoeira, they use evasion instead of blocking.|$|R
50|$|During these encounters, the <b>guard</b> <b>blocks</b> {{the nest}} {{entrance}} with its abdomen and engages in thrusts to eject the intruder. In fact, this may even involve mandibular aggression, which {{often leads to}} the loss of legs and other vital body parts.|$|R
50|$|While he officially {{retired from}} ABC and radio in 1960, he {{indicated}} that his retirement merely meant not working in the medium on a regular basis.

National <b>Guard.</b> <b>Block</b> died at an Englewood, New Jersey hospital September 18, 1967. He was survived by his wife, Joyce, and seven children; six of the children were from previous marriages.|$|E
5000|$|In October 1996, the 125th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron (125 EFS) {{was first}} formed from 138th FW {{personnel}} and aircraft and deployed to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey, {{to join with}} other active-duty and national guard squadrons as part of Operation Northern Watch. This mission {{was part of a}} multi-unit Air National Guard [...] "rainbow" [...] deployment involving the Air National <b>Guard</b> <b>block</b> 42 F-16 squadrons. Each squadron provided eight aircraft to a total of 24 aircraft deployed. The 125th EFS returned to Tulsa and was inactivated on 7 January 1997. Further Northern Watch activations of the 125th EFS and subsequent deployments to Incirlik AB occurred in the spring of 1998 and fall of 2001.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} of this play is to out-number the defense {{at the point}} of attack. The tailback must read the <b>guard's</b> <b>block</b> and run off that. Teams at all levels will use this as a base running play in their offense. This play is typically run out of I-formations.|$|R
25|$|On {{the evening}} of July 8, the {{vigilance}} committee organized a meeting on the Juneau wharf. With a Winchester rifle draped over his shoulder, Soapy began an argument with Frank H.

50|$|Another {{version is}} that the Gestapo interrogator, {{in a fit of}} rage, threw his pistol to the table after {{threatening}} to shoot her. Taking the pistol, Portnova shot him.

After the pistol misfired when Portnova attempted to shoot a <b>guard</b> <b>blocking</b> her access to the street, she was captured.|$|R

50|$|The most simple form of {{this play}} has the strong side {{offensive}} lineman step towards the ball and block any defender inside of him. The fullback will kick out the end man to create the running lane for the ball carrier. The Maryland I used the 2nd back to lead through the hole and block the linebacker. More complicated versions of the play have pulling <b>guards</b> <b>block</b> the linebacker or combination blocks by a tight-end and tackle to create the hole and block the linebacker.|$|R

50|$|Downing {{gas masks}} and gloves, Kwinto {{and his companions}} {{infiltrate}} into the bank through a ventilation shaft of the restaurant located over it. There they stun security <b>guards,</b> <b>block</b> the alarm with a plate {{that served as the}} necklace clasp, and take out of the safe all money and valued papers. With a thermal lance Nuta cuts through a side wall of the safe an opening, and the group goes away leaving at the crime scene a plate of the necklace. Taking advantage of the owner's absence, the accomplices transport the main portion of the valuables to the Kramer's house.|$|R
50|$|In February 2010 {{the town}} was sold to a Russian {{investor}} for 1.6 million Latvian lats ($3.1 million); after that bidder (and a runner-up) backed out, the property was auctioned on June 4, 2010 to Iniciative Europa for 170,000 Latvian lats ($333,000). However the property remains abandoned with a lone <b>guard</b> <b>blocking</b> the main entrance to keep tourists away. The property then was purchased by Skrunda municipality for 12 000€, which in early 2016 started trading tickets for €4 to visit the ghost town, however failing to generate interest from investors the municipality gave tenure of the property to the Ministry of Defense, which will use it for military exercises.|$|R

5000|$|Mount Cody kept Alabama (No. 2 BCS, No. 1 AP) perfect {{with a pair}} of super-sized plays.

He muscled the Tide to another win, with pure brute force. [...] "I didn't really get off the ground," [...] Cody said. [...] "I just reached my arm up. That's how I got it. I knocked blocker back.

50|$|Although, in {{the early}} stages of the game, the Edmonton Eskimos had the early {{advantage}} as they put the opening points on the board using a play that had nothing to do with either quarterback. As Montreal lined up to punt on their own 24, Edmonton lineman, Justin Cooper blew right through a hole that opened when the snapper and right <b>guard</b> <b>blocked</b> opposite directions and there was no one in the backfield to pick up the rush. Cooper almost caught Montreal kicker, Damon Duval's kick right off the foot, but was still able to deflect the football which eventually bounced into the Montreal end zone in which Cooper would recover for a touchdown to give the Eskimos a 7-0 lead.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a parallel implementation for Kernel Andorra Prolog (KAP) named kappaalphapipialpha. The main features of kappaalphapipialpha are AND/OR parallelism, committed choice guard evaluation combined with don't know nondeterminism and constraint operations on variables. The design is based on the Warren Abstract Machine with some important extensions. One of the main problems involving AND/OR parallel systems is the efficient handling of variables. We have adopted the PEPSys hashing scheme with additional mechanisms for handling <b>guard</b> <b>blocking</b> and waiting. A kappaalphapipialpha computation is divided into a number of steps. Every step contains a deterministic phase and a nondeterministic phase. The deterministic phase is executed in a normal Prolog-like way. The nondeterministic phase prunes the tree or divides the tree into a number of OR-branches, which share a common part of the tree. Each OR-branch is executed in the usual Prolog-like manner. status: publishe...|$|R

2500|$|On July 17, 1934, the California National <b>Guard</b> <b>blocked</b> {{both ends}} of Jackson Street from Drumm to Front with machine gun mounted trucks to assist vigilante raids, {{protected}} by SFPD, on {{the headquarters of the}} Marine Workers' Industrial Union and the ILA soup kitchen at 84 Embarcadero. Moving on, the Workers' Ex-Servicemen's League's headquarters on Howard between Third and Fourth was raided, leading to 150 arrests and the complete destruction of the facilities. The employer's group, the Industrial Association, had agents riding with the police. Further raids were carried out at the Workers' Open Forum at 1223 Fillmore street and the Western Worker building opposite City Hall that contained a bookstore and the main offices of the Communist Party, which was thoroughly destroyed. Attacks were also perpetrated on the 121 Haight Street Workers' School and the Mission Workers' Neighborhood House at 741 Valencia Street.
