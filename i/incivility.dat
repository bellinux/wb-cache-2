5|$|The {{market was}} also the {{location}} for public punishment of wrongdoers, and stocks and a pillory were set at a prominent position at {{the eastern end of}} the Guildhall. The stocks were used for the punishment of relatively minor offences such as breaching the regulations on the price of bread, public brawling or <b>incivility</b> to the Mayor; wrongdoers would on occasion also be paraded around the market wearing paper hats bearing details of their offence. The pillory was used for more serious offences such as sedition. On at least two occasions in the late 16th century people convicted of sedition were nailed to the pillory by their ears; on completion of their time on the pillory their ears were cut off. Public whippings of criminals were also conducted in the marketplace. Although not all executions in the period are recorded, it is known that public hangings also took place in the market square and around the market cross.|$|E
25|$|Workplace {{bullying}} overlaps to {{some degree}} with workplace <b>incivility</b> but tends to encompass more intense and typically repeated acts of disregard and rudeness. Negative spirals of increasing <b>incivility</b> between organizational members can result in bullying, but isolated acts of <b>incivility</b> are not conceptually bullying despite the apparent similarity in their form and content. In case of bullying, the intent of harm is less ambiguous, an unequal balance of power (both formal and informal) is more salient, and the target of bullying feels threatened, vulnerable and unable to defend himself or herself against negative recurring actions.|$|E

40|$|The popular <b>incivilities</b> {{hypothesis}} suggests physical <b>incivilities,</b> such as unkempt {{lawns and}} litter, and weak social ties with neighbors encourage crime. Despite a strong impact on policing policies and public awareness, this hypothesis has seldom been tested. We extend this basic model {{to test whether}} place attachments protect from crime as well. In a suburban area facing decline, multilevel (hierarchical linear modeling) analyses reveal that renters, properties with more physical <b>incivilities,</b> and blocks with more physical <b>incivilities</b> experience more subsequent crimes. Although these actual physical <b>incivilities</b> were important predictors of crime, residents’ perceptions of <b>incivilities</b> were not, suggesting that environmental <b>incivilities</b> act directly upon offenders, not through non-offender resident perceptions. A cross-level interaction indicated <b>incivilities</b> predicted crime less well on socially cohesive blocks, suggesting that social cohesion can buffer {{the effects of the}} physical environment. Weaker block level place attachments also contributed independently to individuals’ risks of crime, demonstrating that place attachment merits greater attention in neighborhood revitalization and crime reduction interventions...|$|R
40|$|Several {{aspects of}} the <b>incivilities</b> thesis, or the role of social and {{physical}} disorder in encouraging crime and fear, deserve further testing. These include examining individual- and streetblock-level impacts on reactions to crime and local commitment over time, and testing for lagged and co-occurring impacts at each level. We model these four types of impacts on three reactions to crime and community satisfaction using a panel study of residents ðn 305 Þ on fifty streetblocks, interviewed two times a year apart. At the individual level, <b>incivilities</b> showed unambiguous, lagged impacts on satisfaction, fear, and worry; furthermore, changes in perceived <b>incivilities</b> accompanied changes in resident satisfaction and fear. At the streetblock level: <b>incivilities</b> failed to demonstrate expected lagged impacts on {{either of the two}} outcomes where data structures permitted such impacts; changing <b>incivilities,</b> however, were accomp-anied by changing community satisfaction and changing perceptions of relative risk. Before we conclude that lagged ecological impacts of <b>incivilities</b> are weaker than previous theorizing suggests, we must resolve some outstanding theoretical and methodological issues.

40|$|Many {{adults do}} not achieve {{recommended}} levels {{of physical activity}} (PA), and ecologic models suggest that environmental factors such as physical activity resources (PARs) may influence PA participation. Attributes of PARs, such as accessibility, features, amenities and <b>incivilities,</b> are related to PA. The Physical Activity Resource Assessment (PARA) is an environmental audit tool to assess the type, size, accessibility, <b>incivilities,</b> amenities and features of a PAR. Using the PARA to explore how <b>incivilities</b> and quality of features and amenities differ by location, size or accessibility is an essential step in understanding which attributes influence PA. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare the type, size, accessibility, <b>incivilities</b> and quality of features and amenities of PARs in Houston and Austin, TX and examine the differences in <b>incivilities</b> and quality of features and amenities of PARs by city, type, and accessibility of the resource. Using the PARA, PARs were counted and assessed in Houston (N= 1322) and Austin (N= 297) and categorized by type, size, and cost (a measure of accessibility). The quality of PAR features and amenities were rated (0 =none, 1 =poor, 2 =mediocre, and 3 =good); <b>incivilities</b> were rated using an operational classification (0 =none, 1 =some, 2 =medium, 3 =excessive). T-tests for city and ANOVAs for type, size and accessibility were used to determine group differences in features, amenities and <b>incivilities.</b> The most common type of resource found in Houston and Austin were schools (Houston n= 453; Austin n= 88), followed by parks (Houston n= 386; Austin n= 87). The quality of features per resource was not significantly different between Houston and Austin. The quality of amenities per resource was greater in Houston compared to Austin (t(473) = 4. 183, p 3 ̆c. 001); <b>incivilities</b> were greater in Austin compared to Houston (t(385) =- 6. 909, p 3 ̆c. 001). Significant differences were found in the quality of features (F(8, 1589) = 27. 95, p 3 ̆c. 001), amenities (F(8, 1587) = 52. 14, p 3 ̆c. 001) and <b>incivilities</b> (F(8, 1587) = 14. 24, p 3 ̆c. 001) between types of physical activity resources. Combination resources had the best features, fitness clubs had the best amenities, and trails had the greatest number of <b>incivilities.</b> Free PARs had better features (F(3, 566) = 18. 481, p 3 ̆c. 001) and better amenities than less accessible PARs (F(3, 1565) = 3. 754, p=. 011). However, free PARs had for a higher number of <b>incivilities</b> than pay-for-use PARs (F(3, 1566) = 23. 720, p 3 ̆c. 001). Quality of PARs differed by location, type, and accessibility of the resource. Findings from this study can inform improvement of PARs to increase PA among adults.

40|$|Concepts {{deriving}} from criminology, housing policy, and environmental psychology are integrated to test two ways that housing conditions {{could relate to}} crime in a declining first-ring suburb of Salt Lake City.

For new housing, we test whether a new subdivision on a former brownfield creates spillover reductions in nearby crime and <b>incivilities.</b> Police-reported crime rates were highest for residences near the brownfield and lowest for those farther away. After the subdivision was constructed, this linear decline disappeared, reflecting less crime adjacent to the new subdivision, but also more crime farther away. A multilevel analysis shows that <b>incivilities,</b> particularly litter and unkempt lawns on the block, predict unexpected increases in crime.

40|$|Purpose: Extant {{literature}} {{indicates that}} individual perceptions of collective efficacy and <b>incivilities</b> {{are important in}} explaining fear of crime. These studies, however, often implicitly assume that the relationships between key variables do not differ between neighborhoods. The purpose {{of this research is}} {{to examine the relationship between}} perceptions of collective efficacy, perceptions of <b>incivilities,</b> and fear of crime and determine whether these relationships are constant between neighborhoods. Methods: Surveys were conducted using a sample of residents from four neighborhoods within Miami-Dade County. Structural equation models were used to examine the relationships between perceptions of collective efficacy, perceptions of <b>incivilities,</b> and fear of crime for each neighborhood separately. Tests for invariance were conducted to determine whether the coefficients from these models differed across neighborhoods. Results: Results from these analyses suggest that the relationship between perceptions of collective efficacy and fear of crime exhibit significant heterogeneity between neighborhoods, as do a number of other relationships. The relationships between perceptions of collective efficacy and perceptions of <b>incivilities,</b> and perceptions of <b>incivilities</b> and fear of crime do not exhibit heterogeneity. Conclusions: These results illustrate the importance of examining perceptions of collective efficacy within the neighborhood context. Implications for policy and future research are discusse...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{theories}} {{apply to}} {{fear of crime}} and each are associated with different kinds of variables. Most studies use only one theory, though this study examines {{the relative importance of}} different kinds of variables across a number of theories. The study uses data from a survey of residents in Brisbane, Australia to examine the relative importance of individual attributes, neighbourhood disorder, social processes and neighbourhood structure in predicting fear of crime. Individual attributes and neighbourhood disorder were found to be important predictors of fear of crime, while social processes and neighbourhood structure were found to be far less important. The theoretical implications are that the vulnerability hypothesis and the <b>incivilities</b> thesis are most appropriate for investigating fear of crime, though social disorganization theory does provide conceptual support for the <b>incivilities</b> thesis. Although social processes are less important in predicting fear of crime than neighbourhood <b>incivilities,</b> they are still integrally related to fear of crime: they explain how <b>incivilities</b> arise, they buffer against fear of crime, and they are affected by fear of crime...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} correlation between <b>incivilities,</b> indicators of urban blight, and single-family residential property values in the City of Richmond, Virginia. Through the utilization of a mixed methods research methodology, this dissertation assesses whether specific <b>incivilities,</b> structural characteristics of properties, or community demographics have an adverse influence on property values. Three separate methodologies were utilized in this research including a time series assessment, focus group and individual interviews, and a cross sectional design. The findings from the time series analysis indicate that property values increased every year over a five year period {{and that there were}} variances in property values throughout the City. The qualitative interviews suggested that the location of a property and features of the area heavily influence its value. Higher quality of life amenities tend to have a positive influence on property values and lower quality of life amenities tend to have a negative influence on property values. <b>Incivilities,</b> poverty, and crime were considered attributes of an area that adversely influence property values. The cross sectional analysis suggested that the socio-economics of the area tended to have a stronger correlation to property values than <b>incivilities.</b> Indicators of a high socio-economic status generally had a strong, positive correlation to property values and indicators of a low socio-economic status tended to have a strong, negative correlation to property values. <b>Incivilities,</b> in general, tended to have a moderately weak, negative correlation to property values. The research argues to not overlook but to assess multiple structural and neighborhood factors when examining community conditions. Such an assessment should be conducted at an intimate geographic level rather than a broad, city wide level. From an academic perspective this dissertation fills a hollowness in the empirical literature on the correlation of <b>incivilities</b> to property values. From a practical standpoint, the research provides a renewed lens in which to conceptualize and assess urban conditions and its impressions on communities. Together, this dissertation aids in assessing <b>incivilities</b> and other socio economic conditions {{to one of the most}} pervasive challenges facing municipalities in the 21 st century - the economic stagnation and decline of residential property values...|$|R

The {{purpose of this}} study was to develop and test a brief instrument to systematically document and describe the type, features, amenities, quality and <b>incivilities</b> of a variety of PA resources. Method The one-page Physical Activity Resource Assessment (PARA) instrument was developed to assess all publicly available PA resources in thirteen urban lower income, high ethnic minority concentration neighborhoods that surrounded public housing developments (HDs) and four higher income, low ethnic minority concentration comparison neighborhoods. Neighborhoods had similar population density and connectivity. Trained field coders rated 97 PA resources (including parks, churches, schools, sports facilities, fitness centers, community centers, and trails) on location, type, cost, features, amenities, quality and <b>incivilities.</b> Assessments typically took about 10 minutes to complete. Results HD neighborhoods had a mean of 4. 9 PA resources (n = 73) with considerable variability in the type of resources available for each neighborhood. Comparison neighborhoods had a mean of 6 resources (n = 24). Most resources were accessible at no cost (82 %). Resources in both types of neighborhoods typically had about 2 to 3 PA features and amenities, and the quality was usually mediocre to good in both types of neighborhoods. <b>Incivilities</b> at PA resources in HD neighborhoods were significantly more common than in comparison neighborhoods. Conclusion Although PA resources were similar in number, features and amenities, the overall appearance of the resources in HD neighborhoods was much worse as indicated by substantially worse <b>incivilities</b> ratings in HD neighborhoods. The more comprehensive assessment, including features, amenities and <b>incivilities,</b> provided by the PARA may be important to distinguish between PA resources in lower and higher deprivation areas. </p...|$|R

This study examines cross-sectional associations between the neighbourhood social environment (perceptions of <b>incivilities,</b> crime, and social cohesion) and self-reported physical activity, while accounting for same-source bias and reliability of neighbourhood-level exposure measures, using data from a large population-based clustered sample. This investigation included 11, 035 residents aged 40 – 65 years from 200 neighbourhoods in Brisbane, Australia, in 2007. Respondents self-reported their physical activity and perceptions of the social environment (neighbourhood <b>incivilities,</b> crime and safety, and social cohesion).
