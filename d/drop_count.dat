40|$|Congestion {{avoidance}} techniques monitor {{network traffic}} load {{in an effort}} to anticipate and avoid congestion at common network bottlenecks. Congestion avoidance is achieved through packet dropping. Among the more commonly used congestion avoidance mechanisms is Random Early Detection (RED),which is optimum for high-speed transit networks. Random early detection (RED) is an active queue management algorithm. It not only detects but also avoids congestion by randomly dropping packets to notify congestion. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} comprehend the working of RED algorithm and to learn the effects of variation of RED parameters. To improve the performance of a network in terms of <b>drop</b> <b>count,</b> efficiency, throughput and delay we can optimize our choice of these RED parameter...|$|E

We propose a different parametrization of drop size distributions, which not depending by any particular functional form, {{is based on the}} adoption of standardized central moments. The first three standardized central moments are sufficient to characterize the distribution of drop diamters at the ground. These parameters together with the <b>drop</b> <b>count</b> form a 4 -tuple which fully describe the variability of the drop size distributions. The Cartesian product of this 4 -tuple of parameters is the rainfall phase space.

40|$|A {{specific}} configuration for {{liquid flow}} metrology {{consists of a}} flow of falling drops coupled with a preferred measuring method that derives the flow directly from the <b>drop</b> <b>count.</b> Given the inaccuracy of this counting method, alternative methods have been proposed that measure the volume of each falling drop. The principle consists in deriving the volume from geometric measurements obtained by vision and the basic problem {{can be described as}} the estimation of the volume of a drop from its projection. This paper reviews methods previously used and provides an analysis of qualitative and quantitative aspects of drop volume estimation for flow metrology. Three drop shape models and the related volume estimation methods are defined in a first part. A second part is devoted to an experimental analysis of drop shape variations. In a final experimental part, the presented methods are compared and the good performance of a volume measurement method is experimentally demonstrated. It shows a rms-error of 1 % in normal measurement conditions. These figures speak for the interest of the measurement by vision and represent a good base for predicting the suitability of the method in various applications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{capercaillie}} is a {{rare species}} of forest bird which is once again facing extinction in Britain. Working pine forests are thought to represent the future for capercaillie in Scotland. However, few {{studies have focused on}} capercaillie within working forests and as a result current management recommendations are based on studies conducted within semi-natural pinewoods. Therefore study of the ecology of capercaillie within working forests is vital for the survival of the species in Scotland. The present study investigated the ecology of capercaillie, based on indirect measures of capercaillie use, within Morangie Forest, a pine plantation managed by the Forestry Commission. Monthly <b>dropping</b> <b>counts</b> were collected over a 30 month period to gain insight into the capercaillie population at Morangie Forest, and to explore the use of faecal counts as a non-invasive monitoring tool. Habitat analysis, dietary analysis of droppings and genetic analysis of feathers were further conducted to fully explore ecology of capercaillie within Morangie Forest. Results showed that the capercaillie population in Morangie Forest was subject to seasonal movements and that movements were not confined to the bounds of the forest. Substantial mixing occurred with capercaillie from neighbouring Novar Forest. In addition, capercaillie within Morangie Forest selected habitat at a radius of 50 m and beyond. The population of capercaillie at Morangie Forest was estimated at around 65 individuals based on measures from <b>dropping</b> <b>counts</b> and genetic determination of individuals from feathers. Results also suggested that winter <b>dropping</b> <b>counts</b> could represent a useful tool for forest managers to monitor the size and movement of capercaillie populations frequenting their forests. In addition winter <b>dropping</b> <b>counts</b> could be used in conjunction with habitat data to plan management of habitat for capercaillie. The present study contributes towards future management strategies for the conservation of capercaillie within working forests and suggests further research priorities for capercaillie in Scotland, particularly those focused at a landscape scale...|$|R

40|$|Background: This study {{aimed to}} {{describe}} sepsis related intervention practices among {{health care providers}} within a referral center in Kenya. Methods: Knowledge Attitude and Practice (KAP) surveys assessing sepsis related activities were distributed to health care providers at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) in Eldoret, Kenya. The target population was physicians, clinical officers, and nurses working in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), casualty (emergency) and medicine wards in July 2014. Results: The response rate was 100 % (86 / 86). Crystalloid fluids were the most common resuscitation fluids. About 80 % of the providers in the medicine wards and casualty department utilized the <b>drop</b> <b>count</b> method. Fifty percent of providers at the ICU reported using intravenous fluid pumps. The most common reported cause of sepsis was respiratory infections. The most common reported antibiotics were ceftriaxone and metronidazole. All providers at casualty reported having access to these antibiotics, while only 75 % of providers at the ICU {{indicated that they had}} access to antibiotics (p = 0. 018). Only 43 % of providers reported ordering blood cultures as the initial investigation in patients with sepsis. Invasive catheters were mostly unavailable in the ICU and casualty departments. Common reported barriers to providing care included advanced patient presentation, lack of antibiotics, and lack of sufficient staff. Conclusion: Providers reported a severe lack of invasive critical care equipment across all departments. Participant reported that lack of broad-spectrum antibiotics, lack of staff and lab test and equipment severely hinder optimal management of sepsis in this setting. Thesi...|$|E

40|$|An impact-type Joss-Waldvogel {{disdrometer}} (JWD), {{a two-dimensional}} video disdrometer (2 DVD), and a laser optical OTT Particle Size and Velocity (PARSIVEL) disdrometer (PD) {{were used to}} measure the raindrop size distribution (DSD) over a 6 -month period in Huntsville, Alabama. Comparisons indicate event rain totals for all three disdrometers that were in reasonable agreement with a reference rain gauge. In a relative sense, hourly composite DSDs revealed that the JWD was more sensitive to small drops (, 1 mm), while the PD appeared to severely underestimate small drops less than 0. 76 mm in diameter. The JWD and 2 DVD measured comparable number concentrations of midsize drops (1 - 3 mm) and large drops (3 - 5 mm), while the PD tended to measure relatively higher drop concentrations at sizes larger than 2. 44 mm in diameter. This concentration disparity tended to occur when hourly rain rates and drop counts exceeded 2. 5 mm/h and 400 /min, respectively. Based on interactions with the PD manufacturer, the partially inhomogeneous laser beam is considered the cause of the PD <b>drop</b> <b>count</b> overestimation. PD drop fall speeds followed the expected terminal fall speed relationship quite well, while the 2 DVD occasionally measured slower drops for diameters larger than 2. 4 mm, coinciding with events where wind speeds were greater than 4 m/s. The underestimation of small drops by the PD had a pronounced effect on the intercept and shape of parameters of gamma-fitted DSDs, while the overestimation of midsize and larger drops resulted in higher mean values for PD integral rain parameter...|$|E

Methods Drops in five new 2. 5 -mL bottles were counted and then averaged for each drug. Average retail price {{was determined by}} surveys of pharmacies. <b>Drop</b> <b>count,</b> average retail price, average wholesale price, and IOP reduction data were used to compute annual cost, and cost effectiveness (annual cost-per-mm Hg of IOP reduction) of the three drugs. Results Drops per 2. 5 -mL bottle averaged 113 for bimatoprost 0. 03 %, 84 for latanoprost 0. 005 %, and 83 for travoprost 0. 004 %. Average retail cost (2005) per bottle was $ 69. 99 for bimatoprost 0. 03 %, $ 61. 69 for latanoprost 0. 005 %, and $ 66. 37 for travoprost 0. 004 %. The monthly retail cost of bilateral therapy was $ 37. 92 for bimatoprost 0. 03 %, $ 44. 75 for latanoprost 0. 005 %, and $ 49. 25 for travoprost 0. 004 %.

40|$|The water-drop method (WDM) is a {{long-established}} {{and excellent}} means of measuring soil aggregate stability. While the WDM is very reliable, {{it has a}} drawback in that it requires manual observation of aggregate breakdown and a manual count {{of the number of}} water drops required to disperse a soil aggregate. This makes the method inconvenient and prone to error. To avoid this drawback, we propose a procedure that utilizes digital observations of aggregate breakdown and electronic recording of the water-drop count. In this procedure, water drops from a Mariotte’s tube pass through an electronic device that records the passage of each drop. The impact of water drops on the soil aggregate is digitally recorded with a camcorder. From the <b>drop</b> <b>count</b> and aggregate breakdown records, the number of water drops that strike an aggregate until it is dispersed can be determined. This procedure was evaluated using soil samples from the surface of four different soils. With the automated method, we determined the number of 4. 3 -mm-diam. water drops, each having energy of 1. 67 mJ, required to destroy a 4. 00 - to 4. 75 -mm-diam. aggregate, premoistened to a matric suction of 10 kPa, until it passed through a 2. 8 -mm sieve. The WDM was conducted both manually and with the automated method and the results were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Twenty aggregates were used for each soil in both methods. There were no significant differences (P < 0. 10) between the automated and manual methods in the mean energy required to break an aggregate.
