500|$|After {{appearing}} in the 1986 films Jumpin' Jack Flash and ¡Three Amigos!, Hartman successfully auditioned for NBC's variety show Saturday Night Live (SNL) and joined the cast and writing staff. He told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "I wanted to do [...] because I {{wanted to get the}} exposure that would give me box-office credibility so <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> movies for myself." [...] In his eight seasons with the show Hartman became known for his impressions, and performed as over 70 different characters. Hartman's original Saturday Night Live characters included Eugene, the Anal Retentive Chef and Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer. His impressions included Frank Sinatra, Ronald Reagan, Ed McMahon, Barbara Bush, Charlton Heston, Phil Donahue and Bill Clinton; the last was often considered his best-known impression.|$|E
500|$|In 1948, Hemingway and Mary {{traveled}} to Europe, staying in Venice for several months. While there, Hemingway {{fell in love}} with the then 19-year-old Adriana Ivancich. The platonic love affair inspired the novel Across the River and into the Trees, written in Cuba during a time of strife with Mary, and published in 1950 to negative reviews. The following year, furious at the critical reception of Across the River and Into the Trees, he wrote the draft of The Old Man and the Sea in eight weeks, saying that it was [...] "the best <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> ever for all of my life". The Old Man and the Sea became a book-of-the-month selection, made Hemingway an international celebrity, and won the Pulitzer Prize in May 1952, a month before he left for his second trip to Africa.|$|E
500|$|Lifehouse {{lead singer}} Jason Wade had many inspirations when writing songs for Who We Are. When {{asked about the}} {{background}} of lead single [...] "First Time", Wade said, [...] "It just felt urgent, like a first kiss, a first love. [...] Like {{the first time you}} realize there's more to that relationship than you thought. I had to dig a little for that one, but I find myself at a place where <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> stuff that's a little deeper than your average love song in terms of emotion." [...] Wade was inspired to write [...] "The Joke" [...] after he read a newspaper article that detailed the story of a British boy who hung himself as a result of being bullied by his fellow schoolmates. The song [...] "Broken" [...] was written by Wade after he visited a friend in Nashville that needed a kidney transplant.|$|E

500|$|... “I didn't {{write my}} raps down {{for my first}} four albums — like at all, I did it from the head {{straight}} to the booth. But on this last album, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, I wrote it. I really put myself in the zone that my life was dependent {{on the success of}} this album. With that being the case, I said, ‘You know what? No matter what anybody says about me, they won’t — <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> something that can make someone that hates me the most have to really respect or love the song.’ So even a song like ‘Power,’ I spent 5,000 hours writing it, and it’s really the psychology behind the lyrics; it’s not just blatantly, ‘I’ve got all the power’ — ‘No one man should have all that power.’ It’s worded it in a really sensitive way that opens it up for everyone. Even if I use first person and say ‘I, I, I,’ it’s always for everyone." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} in September 2008 and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 chart. Lovato recalled the experience, [...] "It was like, O.K., you've done it. You're no longer just succeeding because you're in a movie with the Jonas Brothers. These people bought your music for you." [...] Later in February 2009, Lovato's first headlining sitcom, Sonny with a Chance, premiered on Disney Channel. Don't Forget was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and spawned two singles, [...] "Get Back" [...] and [...] "La La Land". In January 2009, Lovato announced to MTV News that she had already begun writing songs for her second studio album, as well as revealing its approach: [...] "It's {{going to take a}} different sound, so hopefully it goes over well. I sing a lot of rock, but this time I want to do more John Mayer-ish type of songs. Hopefully <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> with people like him. I love their music — it would be amazing." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with 100PercentRock.com, Yamano explained that her process for writing and recording has not changed substantially from the band's early days: [...] "I’m lazy and I don’t start writing songs until we book recording studio , but once we booked the studio, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> songs quickly with concentration. Then I send my demo to our members and we rehearse. At the recording studio, we start to record from basic tracks then overdub." [...] On this album, {{every member of the}} band also sings a unique song about a food item; Yamano sings [...] "Fortune Cookie", the band's bassist Ritsuko Taneda lends her vocals to [...] "Ramen Rock", and drummer Emi Morimoto can be heard on [...] "Green Tea". The first song was inspired by Yamano fondness for eating a fortune cookie after a meal of Chinese food in America; after learning that the cookies were actually invented in Japan, Yamano decided to pen the song. [...] "Ramen Rock" [...] was inspired by Taneda's habit of eating ramen after every show. Finally, Yamano asked Morimoto to sing [...] "Green Tea" [...] because she is from Kyoto, which is known for its green tea.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, Andy Strickland of Yahoo! Music {{asserts that}} the album's song [...] "English Trees" [...] shows Finn's [...] "brilliant weaving of a tale of loss and yearning marks him out as {{up there with the}} very best songwriters working today" [...] and of the album's musical {{structure}} as a whole, comments that it is a [...] "collection of songs that reflect Finn's usual palette of singalong pop ("She Called Up"), achingly fine ballads ("Pour le monde"), and darker, more ambient sounds ("A Sigh")". Jessica Letkemann of Billboard points out that to those unfamiliar with Finn's solo work expecting the album to resemble a prior Crowded House work would be surprised, insisting that [...] "Gone are the more overtly '80s top 40 flourishes". Bud Scoppa writes in Uncut Magazine that the album's extremes are portrayed in its first two songs, [...] "Nobody Wants To", which he describes as [...] " [...] the prevailing melancholy mood, as Finn's slide guitar hovers like a solitary seabird over a vocal laced with regret", and [...] "Don't Stop Now", in which [...] "Finn explores the metaphorical possibilities of the GPS, seeking [...] "something <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> about… something I can cry about"".|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the songs}} on the album seem {{to be based on}} the {{pressures}} of fame and dealing with the resulting loss of privacy. These include [...] "Not for You", [...] "Pry, To", [...] "Corduroy", [...] "Bugs", [...] "Satan's Bed", and [...] "Immortality". Vedder said, [...] "I'm just totally vulnerable. I'm way too fucking soft for this whole business, this whole trip. I don't have any shell. There's a contradiction there, because that's probably why <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> songs that mean something to someone and express some of these things that other people can't necessarily express." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Not for You" [...] express anger at the bureaucracy of the music industry and [...] "how youth is being sold and exploited," [...] while Vedder said [...] "Corduroy" [...] is about [...] "one person's relationship with a million people." [...] In [...] "Pry, To" [...] the phrase [...] "P-r-i-v-a-c-y is priceless to me" [...] is repeated. Many think that the lyrics of [...] "Immortality" [...] may be about Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain's suicide, although Vedder has denied this, suggesting instead that it's about [...] "the pressures on someone who is on a parallel train." [...] The lyrics that appeared in the first live version of [...] "Immortality" [...] were altered before the song was released as part of the album. Vedder said regarding [...] "Nothingman" [...] that [...] "if you love someone and they love you, don't fuck up...'cause you are left with less than nothing." [...] "Better Man" [...] is a song about an abusive relationship. Vedder wrote [...] "Better Man" [...] when he was in high school and performed it with his previous band, Bad Radio. Considered a [...] "blatantly great pop song" [...] by producer Brendan O'Brien, Pearl Jam was reluctant to record it and had initially rejected it from Vs. due to its accessibility.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{publication}} of Robin No.181, Roderick Long, a political commentator and Senior Scholar at the Ludwig von Mises Institute, and self-professed fan of the character, expressed annoyance at the portrayal {{of the character of}} Lonnie Machin and the usurpation of the Anarky mantle by Armstrong. Upon learning of Nicieza's reasoning for the portrayal, Long parodied the explanation as a mock-dialectic, writing, [...] "Thesis: Anarky is too interesting a character not to write about. Antithesis: Anarky is too interesting a character for me to write successfully about. Dialectical synthesis: Therefore I will make Anarky less interesting so <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> about him." ...|$|E

Corgan spoke with Rolling Stone about his plans: [...] "We're going to do it Let It Be-style," [...] Corgan said, referring to the documentary about the 1970 Beatles album. [...] "The album would be recorded live, with the cameras rolling. When you get the DVD, you can watch the takes on the album being done." [...] He described the songs he'd written for Djali Zwan as [...] "more folk-driven, rooted in traditional music. I don't want to compromise veins of material to fit into an electric band, which I often did in the Pumpkins.

2500|$|The field {{hospital}} hadn't the facilities to heal such a complex injury; however, it sufficed {{to keep him}} alive. It was {{three weeks before the}} wounded ace was stable enough to be transferred. On 31 October, he shipped out, slated for Saint Vincenzstift Hospital in Hannover. However, his squadronmates alerted his 33-year-old elder sister Franziska. She was a nursing supervisor in Viktoria-Lazarett (Victoria Hospital), Berlin. She arranged for her brother to be diverted to the Berlin clinic of one of Germany's pre-eminent surgeons, Doctor August Bier, who pioneered use of cocaine in spinal anesthesia. Berthold entered the clinic on 2 November 1917. Berthold was there for four months as Doctor Bier labored to save his arm from amputation. Meantime, counter to Berthold's wishes, Oberleutnant Ernst Wilhelm Turck assumed Berthold's dual commands of Jagdstaffel 18 and Jagdgruppe 7. Berthold spent his convalescent leave learning to write with his left hand. He believed, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>write,</b> I can fly." [...] Meantime, his right arm remained paralyzed as it slowly healed. He remained dependent on narcotics.|$|E
2500|$|Milo Goes to College {{is cited}} {{as one of}} the most {{significant}} albums of the early-1980s southern California hardcore punk movement. Steven Blush, author of , remarked that its [...] "cheeky love songs disguised as hardcore blasts became the most aped formula in rock." [...] Rock critic Robert Christgau gave it an A- rating, saying [...] "These fishermen don't kid around about what powers hardcore hyperdrive—not simply an unjust society, but also a battered psyche. When they're feeling bad, any kind of power—money, age, ass-man cool, the possession of a vagina—can set off their anarchic, patricidal, 'homo'-baiting, gynephobic rage. But their bad feelings add poignant weight to the doomed vulnerability of the last four songs, which happen to be their hookiest". Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times called the album [...] "Perfect for the little guy who was ever called a nerd and never got the girl. The chainsaw pop combined with earthy humor conveys what is often an inarticulate rage." [...] Hilburn's review was especially affirming for Stevenson, whose father criticized and discouraged his songwriting: [...] "Robert Hillburn was saying something different. He was saying that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> okay, that I'm a decent songwriter. So it served to shut my dad up a little bit, so that I could pursue the band thing a little less encumbered by his stifling attitude." ...|$|E

2500|$|One track, the folk-tinged {{acoustic}} song [...] "Too Good to Be", was {{not written}} until {{the latter part}} of recording, only being penned in minutes whilst in the studio. Jordan Pundik joked that, [...] "the funny thing is, that's the song you'd think we wrote sitting on a beach around a fire." [...] While all the songs were primarily written on guitar, Chad Gilbert also tracked melodies on piano, despite his limited ability on the instrument. Gilbert explained that, [...] "When we wrote the songs a couple of songs started out on piano, like the melodies. So in pre-production, I did the piano. But I'm not very good, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> melodies, but I just use two fingers, my pointer fingers." [...] Panunzio subsequently brought in Benmont Tench (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers) to play the keyboard, piano and organ parts throughout the album. Paul Buckmaster conducted string sections for [...] "When I Die" [...] and [...] "Boulders", while indie rock band Eisley, comprising three sisters including Gilbert's then-fiancée Sherri DuPree, provided female backing vocals for seven tracks on the album. Once the process of mixing and mastering the record had finalised, the band asked Autumn de Wilde, best known for her portraiture and commercial photography of musicians, to shoot the cover art and liner photography for the album booklet. Chad Gilbert later declared that he was [...] "really proud", citing the music as [...] "the most uplifting" [...] the band had ever written, while Pundik added that Coming Home would be [...] "the one that will stand the test of time." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I Will Try" [...] {{is about}} having a {{positive}} outlook on life. James has explained that he has 'a very negative outlook on the world' and that he can 'never really appreciate anything' so the song is a reminder to himself to try and {{look on the bright}} side. He continued; 'the line [...] "I've got friends who have lost their fathers and they're much stronger men than me" [...] refers mainly to Chris (Pennells, guitar), Jamie (manager) and my dear friend David Rice who have lost family members and yet still find a smile and appreciate all the upsides of life'. [...] "Little White Lies" [...] is about dishonesty. The song 'covers the way that lies eat away at my brain and cause me to almost lose my mind, yet I still keep making mistakes and bad decisions', according to James. He revealed little about the background of [...] "Leeches", saying only that 'Leeches is about something terrible and unspeakable that happened to someone who once made me very happy'. Speaking about [...] "Anemophobia", he said; 'the title of this song means a fear of wind, which I have, but the song on the whole though is about anxiety. ...This song was written when I was at my lowest point, I genuinely believed I was dying. ...The song is also about how lost I felt and still feel and how most days I don't feel like myself any more'. [...] "Fifty Four" [...] is about James' girlfriend. 'She is my only real sense of normality and I owe her more than <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> down in words for that'.|$|E
2500|$|West {{died while}} working at his desk on the final {{chapters}} of his novel The Last Confession, about the trials and imprisonment of Giordano Bruno who was {{burned at the stake}} for heresy in 1600. Bruno was a person with whom West had long sympathised and even identified. In 1969 he had published a blank-verse play, The Heretic, on the same subject. [...] This was staged in London in 1970. Of all his writings, he said this play had [...] "the most of me in it". In 1998 he converted it into a libretto for an opera, which was set to music by Colin Brumby but it has not been staged. In early 1999 he also contemplated a film script based on the play. He wrote The Last Confession {{in the form of the}} diary that Bruno might have written knowing that execution was approaching. [...] The diary was intended to cover the period 21 December 1599 to 17 February 1600, however it covers just 14 days; the entry West was writing when he died was dated 4 January 1600 and he had written only about half as much as he had intended. [...] Nevertheless, the last paragraph he ever wrote was poignant: <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>write</b> no more today … who knows to what nightmares I might wake. West had had several severe heart attacks and undergone double-bypass surgery. Murray Waldren writes: [...] "This is a book written by a man aware death is imminent about a man aware execution is near". [...] West's family decided to publish it in 2000, in an incomplete form and without any editing, leaving readers free to imagine how the story might have ended. [...] It has a foreword by Thomas Keneally, an editor's note by his publisher Angelo Loukakis and an epilogue co-written by his assistant Beryl Barraclough and his widow Joy West.|$|E
