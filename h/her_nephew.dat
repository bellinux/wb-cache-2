5|$|The Queen had {{to mediate}} between her {{brothers}} in 1555, when Charles decided to abdicate as emperor {{and leave the}} government of the Netherlands to his son Philip, despite Ferdinand's objections. When Mary learned of Charles's decision, she informed him that she too would resign. Both Charles and Philip urged her to remain in the post, but she refused. She chronicled the difficulties she had faced due to her gender, the fact that she could not act as she thought she should have because of disagreements with Charles, and her age. Furthermore, she did not wish to accommodate to the ways of <b>her</b> <b>nephew</b> after years of getting used to Charles's demands. The actual reason for Mary's resignation was her numerous disagreements with <b>her</b> <b>nephew.</b> She asked for Charles's permission to leave the Netherlands upon her resignation, fearing that she would be drawn into politics again if she remained.|$|E
5|$|This {{campaign}} {{starts as}} Yodit attempts to flee from <b>her</b> <b>nephew</b> Gidajan, who has framed her for theft. She then seeks {{the hand of}} the Syrian prince Zanobis in marriage and performs several deeds to increase her reputation, having to deal with the Beja tribes, Nobatia, and the Ikshids. Then she defends the pass of Darginda from the army of Dagnajan, the king of Aksum, and his allies, the Begemder, while also dealing with Alodians and Orthodox monks, killing the king before he makes it through the mountain pass. Following this, she takes the fight to Gidajan and takes control of several stelae in the region surrounding the city of Massawa before taking the city itself. She pursues <b>her</b> <b>nephew</b> to Aksum itself and destroys his palace in the city.|$|E

5|$|Mary did {{not enjoy}} her {{retirement}} for long; Eleanor died in her arms in February 1558. The grief-stricken queen travelled to Charles to ask him for advice about her future. Charles {{told her that he}} wanted her to resume regency in the Netherlands, and promised a home and a large income, but Mary declined the offer. <b>Her</b> <b>nephew</b> Philip then urged her advisor to convince her to return. When Charles became ill in August, Mary accepted the offer and decided that she would become governor once again.|$|E
5|$|After 1963 Blyton's output was {{generally}} confined to {{short stories and}} books intended for very young readers, such as Learn to Count with Noddy and Learn to Tell Time with Noddy in 1965, and Stories for Bedtime and the Sunshine Picture Story Book collection in 1966. Her declining health and a falling off in readership among older children have been put forward as the principal reasons for this change in trend. Blyton published her last book in the Noddy series, Noddy and the Aeroplane, in February 1964. In May the following year she published Mixed Bag, a song book with music written by <b>her</b> <b>nephew</b> Carey, and in August she released her last full-length books, The Man Who Stopped to Help and The Boy Who Came Back.|$|E

5|$|Lessons {{depicts a}} mother {{teaching}} her son. Presumably, {{many of the}} events were inspired by Barbauld's experiences of teaching her own adopted son, <b>her</b> <b>nephew</b> Charles, as the events correlate with his age and growth. Although there are no surviving first edition copies of the works, children's literature scholar Mitzi Myers has reconstructed the probable publication dates from Barbauld's letters and the books' earliest reviews as follows: Lessons for Children of two to three (1778); Lessons for Children of three, part I (1778); Lessons for Children of three, part II (1778); and Lessons for Children of three to four (1779). After its initial publication, the series was often published as a single volume.|$|E

The Zamoyski faction supported Sigismund, the faction led by the Zborowski family wanted Maximilian; two separate elections took place and a civil war resulted.

5|$|Unlike her {{children}} and grandchildren, Olga was given a pension {{by the government of}} the Second Hellenic Republic, but she maintained so many of the faithful old servants who had fled Greece with her that she was usually left with no more than 20 pounds sterling per month (worth about £ in 2010 prices) to meet her own expenses. She could, however, count on the support of her family, scattered throughout Western Europe.
