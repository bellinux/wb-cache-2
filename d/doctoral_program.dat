5|$|After the war finished, Rogerson {{continued}} studying fungal systematics {{and started}} a <b>doctoral</b> <b>program</b> with Harry Morton Fitzpatrick at Cornell University; noted mycologist Richard Korf was another of Fitzpatrick's graduate students at the time. Under Fitzpatrick, Rogerson studied Hypomyces fungi and their anamorphs. Fitzpatrick committed suicide in 1950, and Donald S. Welch replaced him as Rogerson's advisor {{for the last few}} months of his <b>doctoral</b> <b>program.</b> Rogerson received his doctorate from Cornell in 1950. That year, he joined the faculty of Kansas State University as an assistant professor, but he would ultimately advance to associate professor. While at Kansas, he worked on the identification of fungi, and published nearly 20 papers on fungal taxonomic novelties, aeromycology (the fungal flora of air), and plant diseases caused by fungi.|$|E
5|$|From its {{founding}} until through early 1920s, the university grew rapidly. It offered {{programs in the}} physical sciences and modern languages, and in 1873, Syracuse added {{one of the first}} architecture programs in the U.S. In 1874, Syracuse created the nation's first bachelor of fine arts degree, and in 1876, the school offered its first post-graduate courses in the College of Arts and Sciences.

40|$|<b>Doctoral</b> <b>programs</b> aim at {{preparing}} students for stewardship in their discipline with particular emphasis on training for research. While <b>doctoral</b> <b>programs</b> have been conventionally offered by research institutions, market demands, changing needs, and other factors are driving traditionally teaching institutions to explore opportunities for implementing information systems (IS) <b>doctoral</b> <b>programs.</b> In this paper we present {{some of the issues}} and challenges involved in designing and implementing IS <b>doctoral</b> <b>programs.</b> The emphasis is on traditionally teaching institutions.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{four factors}} that explain the {{renewed interest in}} teaching in business schools. However, this renewed interest has not yet impacted <b>doctoral</b> <b>programs.</b> Few <b>doctoral</b> <b>programs</b> offer systematic teacher training.

The paper presents three models that can help a potential faculty champion to incorporate teacher training into <b>doctoral</b> <b>programs...</b>|$|R
5|$|MIT's {{graduate}} program has high coexistence with the under{{graduate program}}, and many courses are taken by qualified students at both levels.

5|$|After resigning {{from the}} Emory College faculty, Sledd entered the {{graduate}} school of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, where he began work in the advanced classics <b>doctoral</b> <b>program,</b> specializing in Latin. Sledd received $1,000 in severance pay from Emory pursuant to an agreement with Dickey and unanimously approved by the Emory faculty, and his father-in-law contributed $900 to help cover his tuition and living expenses while he attended Yale. He received a scholarship from the university, and earned his Doctor of Philosophy degree in Latin from Yale in 1903, after only nine months. Stanford University and Syracuse University offered him professorships in Latin; Antioch College offered him its presidency. Sledd declined all offers from Northern and Western institutions, and was determined to return to his native South.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{retention}} {{of women in}} <b>doctoral</b> <b>programs</b> {{continues to be a}} challenge for higher education today. The PhD is considered the most prestigious and most international of all degrees. This paper reviews the key findings and messages from a range of publications to corroborate the key research evidence relating to the reason why women are not enrolling into <b>doctoral</b> <b>programs.</b> It then explores possible explanations and justifications for the attainment gap between women and men in <b>doctoral</b> <b>programs.</b> The paper addresses some of the reasons why women are {{more likely than men to}} dropout of <b>doctoral</b> <b>programs.</b> There is a huge disparity between men and women, who pursue PhD degrees in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM). This paper will address some reasons why women of color are undereducated and underutilized in the area of STEM, and will focus on aspects of social media, status are able to communicate with peers and faculty. Social media can help students build and cultivate relationships that will have an impact on attrition rates on <b>doctoral</b> <b>programs.</b> The cohort model and peer mentoring programs have been instrumental as well in the growth of <b>doctoral</b> <b>programs</b> for the under-represented population of women...|$|R

5|$|The novel Soon I Will Be Invincible is {{the first}} novel by Austin Grossman, an {{established}} video games designer. Grossman {{had come from a}} literary family, son of Judith and Allen Grossman and brother of Lev Grossman, which had fostered his ambition to write his own novel. Instead, Grossman accepted a job working in the video game medium which he credited with teaching him to realistically portray creative characters and situations. He always had an interest in the superhero genre, citing Alan Moore and Frank Miller as literary influences. In the mid-1990s, the idea behind what would become his first novel came to him {{in the form of a}} supervillain's voice. Grossman spent the next few years casually developing the character that would become Dr. Impossible, adding supporting characters, and writing short stories. By 2006, Penguin's imprint Michael Joseph purchased the publishing rights for the UK, as did Rizzoli for an Italian version. By the time, the book was being published Grossman was 37 years old and had entered the University of California-Berkeley's <b>doctoral</b> <b>program</b> studying English Literature, specializing in Romantic and Victorian literature.|$|E
