Patrick often discovers Victor in inexplicably bizarre or compromising situations, leading <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> {{that he is}} insane. The Meldrews' neighbour on the other side, overly cheery charity worker Nick Swainey, also adds to Victor's frustration.|$|E
5|$|As {{it turned}} out, maybe Hadl had led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> {{that we had}} come down to reach some sort of {{monetary}} settlement with him. And it was really funny {{because it was not}} what he was expecting and his reaction was shock.|$|E

Catherine endures the trip alone and {{believes}} that Henry told the General about her suspicions. A few days later, Henry comes to Fullerton and explains that the General discovered that Catherine's family were not as rich as John led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe.</b> He apologises for his father's actions and explains that even though he will probably be disinherited, he loves Catherine and proposes.

Black visits the terminal Hunziger, hoping to change his mind, but the elderly man holds his position. Adele gives Black a folder full of documents relating to the case, which Black reviews. His knowledge of offender profiling leads <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that the convicted man, Malcom, is innocent; however the conviction was secured with a substantial level of physical evidence.|$|E
25|$|In 1914 Mannock {{was working}} as a {{telephone}} engineer in Turkey. After the Ottoman Empire's entry into the war {{on the side of the}} Central Powers he was interned.

60|$|There were a {{good many}} Tories in the State, and, as Honeyman {{had once been a}} British soldier, it was easy enough for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> make <b>believe</b> that he was a Tory, and so make friends with the Redcoats when he should have an opportunity.|$|R
60|$|This {{announcement}} {{had come}} like a thunderbolt to poor Dave, {{and for the}} time being he knew not what to do or say. The others, too, especially his sister Laura and his dear friend, Jessie, were almost equally affected. But they clung <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> refusing <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> the story that Ward Porton was circulating.|$|R
5|$|Chabaneau {{was able}} to easily remove most of platinum's natural impurities, {{including}} gold, mercury, lead, copper, and iron, leading <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that {{he was working with}} pure platinum. However, the metal displayed inconsistent characteristics. At times it was malleable, yet at times it was highly brittle. Sometimes it was entirely incombustible, yet sometimes it burned readily. These inconsistencies were a result of various impurities: rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium, and ruthenium. These elements would later {{come to be known as}} the platinum group metals, but at the time of Chabaneau's research, they had not yet been discovered.|$|E
5|$|Great Barrington had a {{majority}} European American community, who treated Du Bois generally well. He attended the local integrated public school {{and played with}} white schoolmates. As an adult, he wrote about racism which he felt as a fatherless child {{and the experience of}} being a minority in the town. But teachers recognized his ability and encouraged his intellectual pursuits, and his rewarding experience with academic studies led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that he could use his knowledge to empower African Americans. Du Bois graduated from the town's Searles High School. When Du Bois decided to attend college, the congregation of his childhood church, the First Congregational Church of Great Barrington, raised the money for his tuition.Horne, p. 7.Lewis, pp. 39–40.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} {{appearances}} Raiden is a rookie agent who, {{as a result}} of training only in virtual reality, is inexperienced. However, he later reveals that he was feared as a child soldier—known as —who killed several enemies in a civil war and is ashamed of his past. This affects Raiden's personality; he begins to believe he is only useful in the battlefield and his relationship with his girlfriend, Rosemary, would not work. Manipulation by the Patriots causes <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> he does not have free will. Raiden is encouraged by Solid Snake not to be concerned with what people tell him but to rely on himself to face his problems.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of the fight, McClellan is blind, hearing-impaired, suffers {{short-term}} memory loss, and needs to use a wheelchair. Throughout the first year following the fight, the brain damage McClellan suffered led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> refuse <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> he was now blind, instead thinking it was night-time, and would become confused that he was not training for a future fight. To date, he still receives full-time care from his sisters Lisa and Sandra, and regularly asks them about the fight with Benn.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) shows Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) to {{a garden}} that Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) has started. Kate discovers that Sun speaks English {{when the two}} are working in the garden, and Sun asks her not to tell anyone. Locke finds Sayid {{trying to make sense}} of Danielle Rousseau's maps, and gives him a compass. Sayid tells Jack that {{according}} to Locke's compass, north is not where it should be, causing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that the instrument is defective. Hurley and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) spend the day fishing. After Hurley fails to catch anything and accidentally steps on a sea urchin after giving up, Jin treats the wound and later gives Hurley a fish.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Tracy {{begins to}} {{question}} the reason why his sons want to {{spend so much time}} with him. One day, Tracy sees a special about Lyle and Erik Menendez—the two brothers who became famous for killing their parents—which leads <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that his sons are plotting to kill him. As a result, Tracy buys a life-Japanese sex doll that looks like him to use as a decoy to fool them. Eventually, Tracy realizes that he overreacted with his sons but warns his son, Tracy Jr. (Bobb'e J. Thompson), that if he were to die, that he and his brother will face jail time.|$|E
5|$|Political and {{religious}} differences between old Missourians and newly-arriving Mormon settlers provoked {{tensions between the}} two groups, much as they had years earlier in Jackson County. By this time, Smith's experiences with mob violence led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that his faith's survival required greater militancy against anti-Mormons. Around June 1838, recent convert Sampson Avard formed a covert organization called the Danites to intimidate Mormon dissenters and oppose anti-Mormon militia units. Though {{it is unclear how}} much Smith knew of the Danites' activities, he clearly approved of those of which he did know. After Rigdon delivered a sermon that implied dissenters had no place in the Mormon community, the Danites forcibly expelled them from the county.|$|E
50|$|Visita, Lolo’s ex-girlfriend, is also jealous {{and decides}} to help Pamplinas in ruining the baptism. She takes {{advantage}} of Virginio, a young shop assistant who {{is very much in}} love with her, and persuades <b>him</b> <b>to</b> help her spread rumours of Nieves’ infidelity. When Lolo arrives, Visita tells him she has heard rumours that the baby isn’t his. Lolo’s friends and family encourage <b>him</b> not <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> the rumours.|$|R
50|$|Sassanid emperor Shapur II, {{hearing of}} Sarkis' {{reputation}} as a skilled military commander, appointed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> command the Sassanid army. Sarkis credited God for his military victories, which included fending off Julian’s troops entering into Shapur’s kingdom. Sarkis urged troops serving with <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be <b>believe</b> in the Creator of Heaven and earth and their hearts would never be shaken.|$|R

5|$|Blyton's {{father taught}} her to play the piano, which she {{mastered}} well enough for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that she might follow in his sister's footsteps and become a professional musician. Blyton considered enrolling at the Guildhall School of Music, but decided she was better suited to becoming a writer. After finishing school in 1915 as head girl, she {{moved out of the}} family home to live with her friend Mary Attenborough, before going to stay with George and Emily Hunt at Seckford Hall near Woodbridge in Suffolk. Seckford Hall, with its allegedly haunted room and secret passageway provided inspiration for her later writing. At Woodbridge Congregational Church Blyton met Ida Hunt, who taught at Ipswich High School, and suggested that she train as a teacher. Blyton was introduced to the children at the nursery school, and recognising her natural affinity with them she enrolled in a National Froebel Union teacher training course at the school in September 1916. By this time she had almost ceased contact with her family.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{challenge to}} naval artillery was {{the advent of}} aircraft and armour piercing/incendiary bombs, {{which could be used}} against land based targets in support of troop formations ashore. Although in its infancy during and after World War I, some saw the potential for aircraft and sea based air support and envisioned the role it would have in future conflicts. Among the more notable individuals within the United States was Brigadier General Billy Mitchell. Mitchell had served in World War I, where he eventually commanded all U.S. aircraft in the war and was responsible for leading Allied aircraft in support of the ground offensive during the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, one of the first coordinated air-ground offensives in history. Mitchell's experience in World War I led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that battleships were out of date, and he became an increasingly vocal proponent of air power.|$|E
5|$|The {{early part}} of the 20th century saw a number of {{implants}} made of a variety of materials. One of the earliest successful implants was the Greenfield implant system of 1913 (also known as the Greenfield crib or basket). Greenfield's implant, an iridioplatinum implant attached to a gold crown, showed evidence of osseointegration and lasted for a number of years. The first use of titanium as an implantable material was by Bothe, Beaton and Davenport in 1940, who observed how close the bone grew to titanium screws, and the difficulty they had in extracting them. Bothe et al. were the first researchers to describe what would later be called osseointegration (a name that would be marketed later on by Per-Ingvar Brånemark). In 1951, Gottlieb Leventhal implanted titanium rods in rabbits. Leventhal's positive results led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that titanium represented the ideal metal for surgery.|$|E
