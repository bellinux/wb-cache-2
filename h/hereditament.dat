25|$|The {{principle}} Denning stated {{shows that}} if a business occupies a single property, that is the <b>hereditament.</b> If it occupies only the ground floor, that is the <b>hereditament</b> (and the first floor is a separate <b>hereditament).</b> If it occupies the neighbouring property as well, the two together are the <b>hereditament.</b>|$|E

25|$|This {{itself does}} not {{directly}} provide a definition, but depends on the case law already established by prior forms of rating; no statutory definition of the <b>hereditament</b> exists.

25|$|Where the two {{properties}} {{are in the}} same occupation but are not within the same curtilage nor contiguous to one another, each of them must as a general rule be treated as a separate <b>hereditament</b> for rating purposes: and this is the case even though they are used by the occupier for the purposes of his one whole business.|$|E

Since 2006, the consequent Bill on Land Reform & Conveyancing has progressed in the Oireachtas, and been adopted into law, as the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act, Number 27 of 2009.

25|$|Where {{two or more}} {{properties}} are within the same curtilage or contiguous to one another, and {{are in the same}} occupation, they are as a general rule to be treated for rating purposes as if they formed parts of a single <b>hereditament.</b> There are exceptional cases, however, where for some special reason they may be treated as two or more hereditaments.|$|E
25|$|Gilbert v Hickinbottom {{featured}} {{an exception}} to the general rule, where there were two properties in the same occupation, separated by a public highway. It was held that the functional connection between the two properties was so great that they were to be treated as a single <b>hereditament.</b> Functional connection is judged by the strength of the connection and the degree and nature of the separation. In Edwards (VO) v. BP Refinery , the analogy of a spark plug was used to illustrate the principle.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Hereditament</b> is a {{legal term}} for a unit of property, which often appears to be synonymous with simply [...] "property", in the bricks and mortar sense of the word. The concept of <b>hereditament</b> in rating law has {{developed}} along with that of rateable occupation through case law, as no single statute has defined it adequately. The Local Government Finance Act 1988 specifically retained the definition of <b>hereditament</b> from the General Rate Act 1967: ...|$|E

2500|$|Domestic {{property}} {{is defined in}} the Local Government Finance Act 1988 as [...] "used wholly {{for the purposes of}} living accommodation", with provisos to exclude hotels and short stay accommodation and include moorings and caravans where appropriate. It states that unused domestic {{property is}} to be considered domestic if it appears that will be the next use. Any <b>hereditament</b> that does not meet the criteria for domestic will be non-domestic (although it may then be exempt). It is possible for a <b>hereditament</b> to be both non-domestic and domestic in different parts, for example a shop with living accommodation. This is known as a composite <b>hereditament,</b> and the whole property is entered in the rating list, but the non-domestic valuation is based on the non-domestic part only.|$|E
2500|$|The case {{therefore}} {{raises the}} important question: What {{is a separate}} <b>hereditament</b> for rating purposes? The statutes contain no definition, but the practice, which has prevailed for many years past, warrants the following general rules ...|$|E

2500|$|The Local Government Finance Act 1988, with {{follow-up}} legislation, {{provided a}} fresh administrative framework for assessing and billing, {{but did not}} redefine the legal unit of property, the <b>hereditament,</b> that had been developed through rating case law. Properties are assessed in a rating list with a rateable value, a valuation of their annual rental value on a fixed valuation date using assumptions fixed by statute. [...] Rating lists are created and maintained by the Valuation Office Agency, a UK Government Executive Agency. Rating lists can be altered either to reflect changes in properties, or as valuations are appealed against. New rating lists are normally created every five years, however, the 2015 revaluation has been postponed until 2017.|$|E

50|$|Following {{a report}} by the Law Reform Commission, the system of feudal tenure as such, in so far as it had survived, was {{abolished}} by the Oireachtas in the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act (no. 27 of 2009); fee tail was also abolished http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2009/en/act/pub/0027/. However, estates and interests in land, including incorporeal <b>hereditaments,</b> continue. Formerly registered or proven feudal titles with a solid root of title, and the submerged feudal titles of surviving Irish or British peers are not affected, and continue to exist as personal rights, now held in gross. However, the obsolete or unregistered feudal titles, and those that lapsed into desuetude after 1662, when the Irish Parliament passed the Abolition of Tenures Act, no longer exist as incorporeal <b>hereditaments,</b> nor as personal rights, and cannot be revived.|$|R
60|$|The fact {{seems to}} be, {{that the right}} of a son to come into the place of his father, whether in respect to property, power, or social rank, is not a natural, inherent, and indefeasible right, but a {{privilege}} which society accords, as a matter of convenience and expediency. In England, expediency is, on the whole, considered to require that all three of these things, viz., property, rank, and power, in certain cases, should descend from father to son. In this country, on the other hand, we confine the <b>hereditament</b> to property, abrogating it in the case of rank and power. In neither case is there probably any absolute natural right, but a conventional right is allowed to take its place in one, or another, or all of these particulars, according to the opinion of the community in respect to what its true interests and the general welfare, on the whole, require.|$|E
60|$|Though {{for several}} generations the Millthorpes had {{lived on the}} Glendinning lands, they loosely and unostentatiously traced their origin to an emigrating English Knight, who had crossed the sea {{in the time of}} the elder Charles. But that indigence which had {{prompted}} the knight to forsake his courtly country for the howling wilderness, was the only remaining <b>hereditament</b> left to his bedwindled descendants in the fourth and fifth remove. At the time that Pierre first recollected this interesting man, he had, a year or two previous, abandoned an ample farm on account of absolute inability to meet the manorial rent, and was become the occupant of a very poor and contracted little place, on which was a small and half-ruinous house. There, he then harbored with his wife,--a very gentle and retiring person,--his three little daughters, and his only son, a lad of Pierre's own age. The hereditary beauty and youthful bloom of this boy; his sweetness of temper, and something of natural refinement as contrasted with the unrelieved rudeness, and oftentimes sordidness, of his neighbors; these things had early attracted the sympathetic, spontaneous friendliness of Pierre. They were often wont to take their boyish rambles together; and even the severely critical Mrs. Glendinning, always fastidiously cautious as to the companions of Pierre, had never objected to his intimacy with so prepossessing and handsome a rustic as Charles.|$|E
