5|$|April 15, 2007, was the 60th {{anniversary of}} Jackie Robinson's major league debut, with ceremonies held at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California. During the 2007 regular season, <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> Jr. called Bud Selig {{to ask for}} {{permission}} to wear number 42 on Jackie Robinson Day. Griffey received special permission from Rachel Robinson to wear number 42 on Jackie Robinson Day of 2007.|$|E
5|$|Jeter {{started at}} shortstop for the United States {{national}} baseball {{team in the}} 2006 World Baseball Classic. He hit 9-for-20 (.450) and scored five runs in six games. Only teammate <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> Jr. (.524) and Cuba's Yoandy Garlobo (.480) had a higher batting average {{with a minimum of}} 20 at-bats. Jeter's play earned him recognition as the shortstop selection on the All-Tournament Team.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{was based}} in Peoria, Arizona—the site of the Seattle Mariners spring {{training}} camp—for their preparation for the formal start of their 2009 campaign. Unlike 2006, {{in which they had}} one exhibition game, they competed against three different Major League clubs: the Seattle Mariners, the Milwaukee Brewers and the Chicago White Sox. Their game against Seattle was <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> Jr.'s first game playing for the Mariners since October 1999, and was also their first victory as part of a World Baseball Classic tour.|$|E
5|$|Roger Clemens, Wade Boggs, <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> Jr., Steve Sax, Ozzie Smith, José Canseco, Don Mattingly, Darryl Strawberry and Mike Scioscia all guest starred as themselves, {{playing the}} ringers hired by Mr. Burns. Terry Cashman sang a song over the end credits. The guest stars were {{recorded}} over several months, with differing degrees of cooperation. The episode is often named among the show's best, {{and was the}} first to beat The Cosby Show in the ratings on its original airing. In 2014, showrunner Al Jean selected it as one of five essential episodes in the show's history.|$|E
5|$|With {{their first}} overall pick, the Mariners {{selected}} <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> Jr., an outfielder from Moeller High School. Over his 22-year career, Griffey, Jr. {{was elected to}} thirteen All-Star games, won seven Silver Slugger Awards, and helped Seattle make their first playoff appearance as a franchise during the 1995 season. Mark Merchant, whom the Pirates drafted second overall, never played in a MLB game; two years after they drafted him, Pittsburgh traded Merchant to Seattle. The Pirates made the playoffs for three consecutive seasons from 1990–1992 but lost in the National League Championship Series all three years.|$|E
5|$|On January 9, 2007, Ripken {{was elected}} to the Hall of Fame, {{appearing}} on 537 out of 545 of the ballots cast (98.53%), eight votes short of a unanimous selection. His percentage is the fourth highest in history, behind <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey</b> Jr. (99.32 percent), Tom Seaver who received 98.84 percent of the vote and Nolan Ryan who received 98.79 percent. Tony Gwynn, who was appearing on his first ballot as well, was chosen alongside Ripken. Both Hall of Fame-Elects were formally inducted on July 29, 2007. The induction ceremony was attended by a record 75,000 people including special guests of Ripken: John Travolta, Kelly Preston, Steve Geppi, and Ron Shapiro (Ripken's agent during his career).|$|E
5|$|Among outfielders {{and among}} all Silver Slugger winners, Barry Bonds {{has won the}} most awards, winning twelve times between 1990 and 2004. All of his awards were won in the National League. Manny Ramirez leads the American League with eight wins. <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> Jr., Vladimir Guerrero, and Tony Gwynn have each won seven Silver Sluggers in the outfield; Juan González, Kirby Puckett, and Sammy Sosa have won six times. Two players have won five times (Albert Belle and Dave Winfield), and four-time winners include Andre Dawson, Matt Holliday, Dale Murphy, Gary Sheffield, and Ryan Braun. There have also been 7 three-time outfield winners and 18 two-time awardees. The most recent winners are Ryan Braun, Matt Kemp, and Justin Upton in the National League, and José Bautista, Curtis Granderson, and Jacoby Ellsbury in the American League.|$|E
5|$|April 15, 2005, was the 58th {{anniversary of}} Jackie Robinson's major league debut. Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig officially {{declared}} that every April 15 would be designated as Jackie Robinson Day {{and it would}} be celebrated each year throughout Major League Baseball. Every ballpark in Major League Baseball in the United States celebrated Jackie Robinson Day, unlike in 2004 when it was only celebrated in 13 ballparks. Each ballpark showed a video tribute to Robinson, and many brought out Jackie Robinson Foundation scholars onto the field before the games. In Cincinnati, Ohio, <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> Jr. spoke of how much every African-American baseball player owes Robinson, who was chosen by manager Branch Rickey to break the color line because of Robinson's inner courage and ability to keep his temper in check.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Rick Monday became MLB's {{first draft}} pick after being {{selected}} by the Kansas City Athletics. Royce Lewis is the most recent first overall pick; he was drafted by the Minnesota Twins in 2017. Overall, 23 of the 50 picks before 2015 {{have participated in the}} All-Star Game, and three (Bob Horner, Darryl Strawberry, and Bryce Harper) have won the Rookie of the Year Award. Twenty-five of the fifty picks before 2015 have been drafted from high schools, one has been drafted out of the Independent American Association, and the others were drafted from universities. To date, Arizona State University and Vanderbilt University are the only schools from which multiple number-one overall draft picks have been chosen. No first overall pick was inducted into the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame until 2016, when <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> Jr. was inducted with a record 99.3% of votes cast.|$|E
5|$|In {{the bottom}} half of the inning, Yankees ace Jack McDowell, who had entered the game in the 9th inning for a rare relief appearance, faced Joey Cora, <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> Jr., and Edgar Martínez—the second, third, and fourth batters in the Mariners' order, respectively. Second baseman Cora dragged a bunt down the first base line and reached first base safely on an infield hit. Yankees manager Buck Showalter argued the call, believing Cora should have been called out for running off the baselines; however, the umpires' ruling stood. Center fielder Griffey singled to short right-center field, {{allowing}} Cora to reach third base. Designated hitter Martinez then doubled down the left field line, scoring Cora with the tying run and Griffey with the winning run. The Mariners' dugout emptied and mobbed Griffey, Martinez, and Cora on the field in celebration of the franchise's first ever playoff series victory.|$|E
5|$|Roberto Clemente and Willie Mays {{are tied}} for the most Gold Gloves won among outfielders; Clemente won 12 {{consecutive}} National League awards with the Pittsburgh Pirates, as did Mays with the New York and San Francisco Giants. Four outfielders are {{tied for the}} second-highest total with 10 wins: Jones, <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> Jr., Al Kaline, and Ichiro Suzuki. There is one 9-time winner, Torii Hunter, who won his awards consecutively. There have been six 8-time winners (Barry Bonds, Evans, Paul Blair, Andre Dawson, Jim Edmonds, and Garry Maddox), and four 7-time awardees (Winfield, Curt Flood, Larry Walker, Devon White. Yastremski, Murphy and Kirby Puckett each won six American League awards; there have been seven 5-time winners and six 4-time winners as well. Darin Erstad won a Gold Glove as a first baseman in 2004 after winning two awards in the outfield (2000, 2002), making him the only player to win the award as an infielder and an outfielder.|$|E
5|$|The most Gold Gloves {{ever won}} by one player is 18 by pitcher Greg Maddux. He won 13 {{consecutive}} awards from 1990 to 2002, {{all in the}} National League. Brooks Robinson has the most wins as a third baseman, with 16 Gold Gloves, and is tied for the second-highest total overall with pitcher Jim Kaat, who won his 16 awards consecutively. Iván Rodríguez has won the most Gold Gloves as a catcher, with 13 career awards in the American League. Ozzie Smith has 13 wins at shortstop; he and Rodríguez are tied for the fourth-highest total among all winners. Among outfielders, Roberto Clemente and Willie Mays, who played primarily right field and center field, respectively, are tied for the lead with 12 Gold Gloves. Keith Hernandez, the leader at first base, has won 11 times, and Roberto Alomar leads second basemen with 10 wins. Other players with 10 or more wins include shortstop Omar Vizquel (11), catcher Johnny Bench (10), third baseman Mike Schmidt (10), and outfielders <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey</b> Jr., Ichiro Suzuki, Andruw Jones, and Al Kaline (10 each).|$|E
5|$|Twelve {{players were}} {{named to the}} Major League Baseball All-Star team in their Comeback Award-winning season: Jim Thome, Nomar Garciaparra, Dmitri Young, Cliff Lee, Brad Lidge, Aaron Hill, Tim Hudson, Lance Berkman, Jacoby Ellsbury, Buster Posey, Fernando Rodney, and Mariano Rivera. Two players who were not named to the All-Star team in their winning year—Jason Giambi and <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> Jr.—were named to the All-Star team in their {{previous}} season. Several winners have won other awards in their winning season. Carlos Peña, Posey, Ellsbury, Griffey and Hill won the Silver Slugger Award along with the Comeback Award. Posey won the NL MVP in his comeback season. Lee won the Cy Young Award in his winning season and Lidge won both the Rolaids Relief Man and DHL Delivery Man Awards the same year. Rodney was also named Delivery Man in his comeback 2012 season. The most recent winners are Anthony Rendon from the NL and Rick Porcello from the AL.|$|E
5|$|As an {{exception}} to the retired-number policy, MLB began honoring Robinson by allowing players to wear number 42 on April 15, Jackie Robinson Day, which is an annual observance that started in 2004. For the 60th anniversary of Robinson's major league debut, MLB invited players to wear the number 42 on Jackie Robinson Day in 2007. The gesture was originally the idea of outfielder <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> Jr., who sought Rachel Robinson's permission to wear the number. After receiving her permission, Commissioner Bud Selig not only allowed Griffey to wear the number, but also extended an invitation to all major league teams to do the same. Ultimately, more than 200 players wore number 42, including the entire rosters of the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Mets, Houston Astros, Philadelphia Phillies, St. Louis Cardinals, Milwaukee Brewers, and Pittsburgh Pirates. The tribute was continued in 2008, when, during games on April 15, all members of the Mets, Cardinals, Washington Nationals, and Tampa Bay Rays wore Robinson's number 42. On June 25, 2008, MLB installed a new plaque for Robinson at the Baseball Hall of Fame commemorating his off-the-field impact on the game as well as his playing statistics. In 2009, all uniformed personnel (players, managers, coaches, and umpires) wore number 42 on April 15.|$|E
5|$|Ruth set the Major League Baseball single-season {{home run}} record four times, first at 29 (1919), then 54 (1920), 59 (1921), and finally 60 (1927). Ruth's 1920 and 1921 seasons are {{tied for the}} widest margin of victory for a home run {{champion}} as he topped the next highest total by 35 home runs in each season. The single season mark of 60 stood for 34 years until Roger Maris hit 61 home runs in 1961. Maris' mark was broken 37 years later by both Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa during the 1998 home run record chase, with McGwire ultimately setting the mark at 70. Barry Bonds, who also has the most career home runs, set the current single season record of 73 in 2001. The 1998 and 2001 seasons each had 4 players hit 50 or more home runs – Greg Vaughn, <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> Jr., Sosa, and McGwire in 1998 and Alex Rodriguez, Luis Gonzalez, Sosa, and Bonds in 2001. A player has hit 50 or more home runs 42 times, 25 times since 1990. The lowest home run total to lead a major league was four, recorded in the NL by Lip Pike in 1877 and Paul Hines in 1878.|$|E
5|$|The National League {{got things}} {{started in the}} bottom of the first when José Reyes led off with a base hit off American League starter Dan Haren and {{proceeded}} to steal second. He scored on an RBI single by <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> Jr. to give the NL a 1–0 lead. Barry Bonds nearly gave his hometown fans something to cheer for {{in the bottom of}} the third when, with Reyes on second, he lofted a high fly ball to left field, but it was snared at the warning track by Magglio Ordóñez. The AL nearly tied the game in the fourth when Alex Rodriguez attempted to score on a two-out single by Iván Rodríguez. However, the throw to home plate by Griffey allowed Russell Martin to tag Rodriguez out at the plate to end the inning. The AL would score one inning later when, after Chris Young issued a leadoff walk to Brian Roberts, Ichiro Suzuki hit a long fly ball off the right field wall. Instead of caroming straight to Griffey, the ball took an unusual bounce off a sign and ricocheted to Griffey's right. This allowed Ichiro to score on what became the first and only inside-the-park home run in All-Star Game history. The homer gave the AL a 2–1 lead and resulted in Ichiro's MVP win.|$|E
25|$|On October 4, Raines, Jr. played {{center field}} and Raines, Sr. played left field for Baltimore, {{becoming}} the second {{father and son}} team {{to play for the}} same major league team (a feat previously accomplished by <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> Sr. and <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> Jr.).|$|E
25|$|Future Hall of Famer <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey</b> Jr. {{began his}} {{professional}} {{career with the}} Bellingham Mariners. He played in the Northwest League on the team based in Bellingham.|$|E
25|$|In July, Ausmus {{played at}} Nationals Park, {{appearing}} in his 44th major league stadium. Among active players, only Chris Gomez (47), Gary Sheffield (47), and <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> Jr. (45) had competed in more stadiums.|$|E
25|$|On June 2, 2010 <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> Jr. {{announced}} his retirement after 22 MLB seasons. Griffey ended his career with 630 home runs, fifth-highest in MLB history, 10 Gold Gloves, and one Most Valuable Player Award.|$|E
25|$|Ichiro won his tenth {{consecutive}} Rawlings Gold Glove Award in 2010, tying <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey</b> Jr., Andruw Jones, and Al Kaline, and trailing only Roberto Clemente and Willie Mays (twelve each) {{for major}} league outfielders. Ichiro also won his second consecutive and third overall Fielding Bible Award for his statistically based defensive excellence in right field.|$|E
25|$|The stadium was {{the venue}} where Mark McGwire hit his NL-record 57th home run to best Hack Wilson's 68-year-old record of 56 in 1998. <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey</b> Jr. hit his 600th career home run off Mark Hendrickson of the Marlins on June 9, 2008; and where Roy Halladay of the Philadelphia Phillies pitched the 20th perfect game in Major League Baseball history on May 29, 2010, against the Marlins.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Nike aired a {{commercial}} featuring {{a diverse group}} of Major League Baseball players singing lines of the song in their native languages. The players and languages featured were <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> Jr. (American English), Alex Rodriguez (Caribbean Spanish), Chan Ho Park (Korean), Kazuhiro Sasaki (Japanese), Graeme Lloyd (Australian English), Éric Gagné (Québécois French), Andruw Jones (Dutch), John Franco (Italian), Iván Rodríguez (Caribbean Spanish), and Mark McGwire (American English).|$|E
25|$|During the 1999-2000 {{off-season}} Williamson's {{name came}} up {{several times in}} trade talks with the Seattle Mariners, who were looking to deal <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> Jr., {{but in the end}} Williamson remained with Cincinnati. Williamson returned for the 2000 season but was bedeviled by injuries, including two broken toes in mid-September. He made fewer appearances than in 1999 but pitched more innings, due in part to joining the starting rotation after the All-Star break.|$|E
25|$|Sheets {{started the}} 2006 {{season on the}} {{disabled}} list but quickly came off it only to pitch three starts before going on the DL again with shoulder tendinitis. He returned to the starting rotation two weeks after the All-Star break. Sheets pitched a 7-inning shutout against the Pittsburgh Pirates. In his second game back he would pitch nearly a complete game shutout but in the 9th, Sheets gave up a 2-run homer to <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey</b> Jr of the Reds.|$|E
25|$|As the 1998 season progressed, {{it became}} clear that McGwire, Seattle Mariners outfielder <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey</b> Jr., and Chicago Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa were all on track to break Roger Maris' single-season home run record. The race to break the record first {{attracted}} media attention as the home run leader changed often throughout the season. On August 19, Sosa hit his 48th home run to move ahead of McGwire. However, later that day McGwire hit his 48th and 49th home runs to regain the lead.|$|E
25|$|On February 18, the Mariners signed <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> Jr. to {{a one-year}} contract, {{returning}} {{him to the}} city where he played from 1989–1999 and was named {{a member of the}} All-Century Team. Griffey was re-issued his old uniform number, 24, which had not been issued to any on-field personnel since his February 2000 trade to Cincinnati. On April 15, Griffey hit his 400th home run in a Mariners uniform, becoming the only player to hit 400 home runs with one club (Seattle) and 200 with another (Cincinnati).|$|E
25|$|He {{appeared}} in the 1994 movie Cobb as an unidentified pitcher for the Philadelphia A's. In 2003, {{he was part of}} an advertising campaign for Armour hot dogs with MLB players <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey</b> Jr., Derek Jeter, and Sammy Sosa. Since 2005, Clemens has also {{appeared in}} many commercials for Texas-based supermarket chain H-E-B. In 2007, he appeared on a baseball-themed episode of MythBusters ("Baseball Myths"). He has also starred in a recent commercial for Cingular parodying his return from retirement. He was calling his wife, Debra Godfrey, and a dropped call resulted in his return to the Yankees.|$|E
25|$|Michael Cuddyer {{served as}} the Twins {{representative}} at the All-Star game, his first appearance. Bert Blyleven's number was retired during the season {{and he was also}} inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame during the month of July. On August 10, Nathan recorded his 255th save, passing Rick Aguilera for first place on the franchise's all-time saves list. On August 15, Thome hit 599th and 600th home run at Comerica Park to become the eighth player in Major League history to hit 600 home runs, joining Babe Ruth, Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa, <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> Jr., and Alex Rodriguez.|$|E
25|$|Rodriguez {{was again}} an All-Star in 2006. His 2,000th hit, on July 21, 2006 − six {{days prior to}} his 31st {{birthday}} − was also his 450th home run. Rodriguez became the youngest player in baseball history to reach 450 home runs (surpassing <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> Jr., by 267 days), and the eighth player to reach 2,000 hits before turning 31. Ty Cobb reached the mark while still 29, while Rogers Hornsby, Mel Ott, Hank Aaron, Joe Medwick, Jimmie Foxx, and Robin Yount all achieved their 2,000th hit at age 30. All seven are members of baseball's Hall of Fame.|$|E
25|$|During {{the games}} of the 1970s and 1980s, {{alternate}} jerseys were commonly worn by players from the Oakland Athletics, Baltimore Orioles, Cleveland Indians and Chicago White Sox. When the late 1980s and early 1990s approached, fewer alternates were worn for the games. They were back in use for the 1992 game by White Sox pitcher Jack McDowell and infielder Robin Ventura, and for the final time in the 1997 game by Seattle Mariners outfielder <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey</b> Jr. & by San Diego Padres 3rd baseman Ken Caminiti. Under current MLB rules, alternate jerseys are no longer allowed to be worn during the game, as players must wear either their team's white or gray uniforms, depending on which league is the home team.|$|E
25|$|In Game 4, B.J. Upton hit two solo {{home runs}} {{in his first two}} at-bats which gave the Rays an early 2–0 lead. Cliff Floyd added an RBI double, {{followed}} by a Dioner Navarro RBI single in the 4th inning put the Rays ahead by 4 runs. Paul Konerko put the White Sox on the board with a solo home run in the 4th inning, but was answered in the 5th inning by a Carlos Peña single that scored one run, giving the Rays a 5–1 lead. Jermaine Dye had a solo home run in the 6th inning, but once again the Rays answered back with another RBI single by Peña in the 7th inning. Grant Balfour came in to close the game and struck out <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> Jr. to end the game, and in their first playoff series in franchise history, the Rays took the series three games to one, and advanced to the American League Championship Series.|$|E
25|$|Agassi {{established}} a {{limited liability company}} named Andre Agassi Ventures (formerly named Agassi Enterprises). Agassi, along with five athlete partners (including Wayne Gretzky, Joe Montana, Shaquille O'Neal, <b>Ken</b> <b>Griffey,</b> Jr., and Monica Seles) opened a chain of sports-themed restaurant named Official All Star Café in April 1996. The restaurant closed down in 2001. In 1999, he paid $1 million for a 10 percent stake in Nevada First Bank and made a $10 million profit when it was sold to Western Alliance Bancorp in 2006. In 2002, he joined the Tennis Channel to promote the channel to consumers and cable and satellite industry, and made an equity investment in the network. After meeting chef Michael Mina {{at one of his}} restaurants in San Francisco, Agassi partnered with him in 2002 to start Mina Group Inc. and opened 18 concept restaurants in San Francisco, San Jose, Dana Point, Atlantic City and Las Vegas. Agassi was an equity investor of a group that acquired Golden Nugget Las Vegas and Golden Nugget Laughlin from MGM Mirage for $215 million in 2004. One year later, the group sold the hotel-casino to Landry's, Inc. for $163 million in cash and $182 million in assumed debt. In 2007, he sat on the board of Meadows Bank, an independent bank in Nevada. He has invested in start-up companies backed by Allen & Company.|$|E
500|$|At age 15 Musial {{joined the}} Donora Zincs, a semi-professional team managed by Barbao. In his Zincs debut he pitched 6 innings {{and struck out}} 13 batters, all of them adults.
