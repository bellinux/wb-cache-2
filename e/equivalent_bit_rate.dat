40|$|Abstract-We {{propose a}} full color video {{compression}} strategy, based on 3 -D subband coding with camera pan compensation, {{to generate a}} single embedded bit stream supporting multiple decoder display formats and a wide, finely gradated range of bit rates. An experimental implementation of our algorithm produces a single bit stream, from which suitable subsets are extracted to be compatible with many decoder frame sizes and frame rates and to satisfy transmission bandwidth constraints ranging from several tens of kilobits per second to several megabits per second. Reconstructed video quality from any of these bit stream subsets is often found to exceed that obtained from an MPEG- 1 implementation, operated with <b>equivalent</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> constraints, in both perceptual quality and mean squared error. In addition, when restricted to 2 -D, the algorithm produces {{some of the best}} results available in still image compression. David Taubman and Avideh Zakhor I...|$|E

40|$|A {{multispectral}} {{image data}} compression scheme {{has been investigated}} in which a scene is imaged onto a detector array whose elements vary in spectral sensitivity. The elements are staggered such that the scene is undersampled within any single spectral band, but is sufficiently sampled by the total array. Compression thus results from transmitting only one spectral component of a scene at any given array coordinate. The pixels of the mosaic array may then be directly transmitted via PCM or undergo further compression (e. g. DPCM). The scheme has the advantages of attaining moderate compression without compression hardware at the transmitter, high compression with low-order DPCM processing, and a choice of reconstruction algorithms suitable to the application at hand. Efficient spatial interpolators such as parametric cubic convolution may be employed {{to fill in the}} missing pixels in each spectral band in cases where high resolution is not a requirement. However, high-resolution reconstructions are achieved by a space-variant minimum-mean-square spectral regression estimation of the missing pixels of each band from the adjacent samples of other bands. In this case, reconstruction accuracy is determined by the local spectral correlations between bands, the estimates of which include the effects of interband contrast reversal. Digital simulations have been performed on three-band aerial and four-band Landsat multispectral images. Spectral regressions of mosaic array data can provide reconstruction errors comparable to second-order DPCM processing and lower than common intraband interpolators at data rates of approximately 2 bits per pixel. When the mosaic data is itself DPCM-coded, the radiometric accuracy of spectral regression is superior to direct DPCM for <b>equivalent</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Digital Cinema (DC) {{electronic}} distribution requires networks {{with high}} available bandwidth. In this paper, we propose {{a system that}} adopts a frequency multiplex of DVB-T signals to deliver JPEG 2000 video over wideband wireless channels. The objective {{of this paper is}} to present a transmission scheme that, by transmitting over DVB-T channels, provides content distributor and/or end users with the possibility to obtain a very high quality video stream. The source coded video can be downsampled to a video quality still at an high level, and then compressed with parameters reflecting the specifications for DC. The stream is thus split and encapsulated into MPEG- 2 TS packets. A proper strategy of substream multiplexing and composition is presented, which may reduce the residual error effects and bandwidth requirements. An additional Forward Error Correction (FEC) layer using JPWL can be applied to further enhance transmission robustness. At the receiver side a proper demultiplexing and decompression is performed. Eventually, we will also present simulated results in terms of objective video quality vs. channel SNR or <b>equivalent</b> <b>bit</b> error <b>rate.</b> I...|$|R

30|$|In those {{simulation}} results, FDASH requests many segments {{at a low}} <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> {{until the}} target buffer level is reached. After reaching the target buffer level, the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> of the next segment gradually increases. In Fig.  6, the FDASH client requests the segment of 1500  kbps at 73  s for the first time, which is the 34 th request, while the proposed scheme requests a segment of 1500  kbps at 18  s for the first time, which is the 7 th request. In other words, the FDASH client has to wait 136  s (34 [*]×[*]D) to view the video at 1500  kbps. The SARA increases the client buffer level quickly by requesting many low <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> segments and requests a high <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> segment {{when there is a}} sufficient buffer level. However, because it requests an excessively high <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> segment, the download time for the segment is too long and the client buffer is quickly consumed.

In addition, although FDASH and SARA show small variations when the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> increases, they generally show large variations when the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> decreases.

Error resilience tools provide a mechanism enabling transmission of visual information over channels with residual random bit errors in the received bit stream.

The error resilience tools {{make it possible to}} achieve an acceptable visual quality even in the presence of these residual errors. Our work is related and compared to the standardization work of the next-generation still image compression system JPEG 2000. The results show that partial and complete substitution of the quantization and symbol encoding in visual compression systems by robust error resilience tools provides a signif-icant increase in robustness. Three error resilience tools are discussed: (1) substitution of the quantization and symbol encoding by a fixed length coding scheme, (2) substitution by a mixed fixed length coding and variable length coding scheme, and (3) substitution of the variable length coding by reversible variable length coding.

50|$|As {{is obvious}} by its {{definition}} <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> {{is a measure}} of the rate of information content of the digital video stream. In the case of uncompressed video, <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> corresponds directly to the quality of the video (remember that <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> is proportional to every property that affects the video quality). <b>Bit</b> <b>rate</b> is an important property when transmitting video because the transmission link must be capable of supporting that <b>bit</b> <b>rate.</b> <b>Bit</b> <b>rate</b> is also important when dealing with the storage of video because, as shown above, the video size is proportional to the <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> and the duration. <b>Bit</b> <b>rate</b> of uncompressed video is too high for most practical applications.
