40|$|The {{presence}} of residual stress in steel members can significantly compromise the stiffness and fatigue life of steel structural components. This influence becomes more serious for the wide <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> {{in the construction}} of large-sized steel members due to the different residual stress distribution from the normal size <b>butt</b> <b>welds.</b> This paper experimentally studied the residual stress in the wide <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> through an 8 -experiment test program. High residual stress was produced during the wide <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> and this stress was observed to be even higher than the yield strength of the steel. Moreover, this residual stress in the steel plate was firstly compressive and then transferred into tensile stress with the increase in the distance away from the <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> line. The magnitude of the residual stress increased with the increase in the width of the welding seams. This paper also developed a finite element model by SYSWELD to simulate the residual stress produced by the wide <b>butt</b> <b>welding.</b> The accuracy of the FE simulation was checked by the reported test results. In order to reduce the residual stress, the ultrasonic peening method was adopted. The analysis results indicated that ultrasonic peening method effectively reduced the residual stress caused by the wide <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> during the construction...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Butt</b> <b>welds</b> are welds {{where two}} pieces of metal are to be joined {{are in the same}} plane. These types of welds require only some {{preparation}} and are used with thin sheet metals that can be welded with a single pass. Common issues that can weaken a <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> are the entrapment of slag, excessive porosity, or cracking. For strong welds, the goal is to use the least amount of <b>welding</b> material possible. <b>Butt</b> <b>welds</b> are prevalent in automated welding processes, such as submerged-arc welding, due to their relative ease of preparation.

40|$|Flash <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> {{is a well}} {{established}} economical process for solid state <b>butt</b> <b>welding.</b> It consists indirect electrical heating of {{the ends of the}} work pieces to be welded and forging them together. While heating, a thermal distribution characterized by a steep temperature gradient is established along the axial length of the pieces. Flash <b>butt</b> <b>welding</b> is widely used for steel band welding m wheel industry. Major advantages are economical in operation, suitable for mass production and high in joint strength. Loadstar (pvt) Ltd has six flash butt machines in different production lines for rim and band manufacturing. The major problem is considerably high amount of scrap percentage due to welding cracks.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The objective {{of the study was}} to examine factors that influence the strength of <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> and gain an understanding of the process of failure. The study was divided into several sectors. The first and primary part of the programme was to determine the extent to which the pipe system's long-term strength under both internal fluctuating and constant pressure is reduced by the presence of axially misaligned <b>butt</b> <b>welds.</b> The second objective was to examine fracture initiation sites and crack propagation paths of the failed aligned and misaligned <b>butt</b> <b>welded</b> samples in relation to the melt flow zone and the weld bead in order to establish the cause of failure. Finally the project considered the influence of selected welding parameters on the fatigue performance of aligned <b>butt</b> fusion <b>welds</b> and an investigation into the influence of elevated temperature (79 °C) testing technique on the basic material's properties. Fatigue and stress-rupture lifetimes were found to decrease significantly with increasing axial misalignment at the <b>butt</b> fusion <b>weld</b> in 63, 90 and 125 mm MDPE pipe systems at 79 °C in a water environment. In the <b>butt</b> fusion <b>weld</b> having axial misalignment of 20 per cent of the wall thickness and above, the reduction in the fatigue and stress-rupture lifetime was greater than 50 per cent compared to the aligned weld. It was not clear whether there is a pipe size effect or not; there was no marked change in the fatigue performance of misaligned <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> for the three pipe diameters examined. However, the fatigue performance of the aligned <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> in 90 and 125 mm was noticeably better compared to 63 mm pipe systems. The stress rupture performance of misaligned <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> in 90 and 125 mm MDPE pipes was more than halved compared to those in 63 mm pipe systems. Both the fatigue and stress rupture performance of misaligned <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> could be explained in terms of amplified axial stress and in general, the Ory expression for evaluating the increase in axial stress due to misalignment appears to be valid. The temperature dependence of the fatigue performance of aligned and misaligned <b>butt</b> fusion <b>welds</b> in 63 and 90 mm MDPE pipe systems suggests that if continuous internal fluctuating pressure under the conditions examined is maintained, then the <b>butt</b> fusion <b>welds</b> with axial misalignment of below 10 per cent of the wall thickness may well meet the design lifetime of 50 years at the service termperature. Under stress-rupture conditions, all the misaligned <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> considered in the three pipe diameters surpassed the minimum specified requirement of 170 hours at 79 °C. The fatigue was the most aggresive condition of the two for minor misalignment. Examination of the circumferential <b>butt</b> <b>weld</b> failures revealed that the crack invariably initiated from the notch located at the inner weld bead and no preferred crack propagation path was taken in relation to the melt flow zone. It was proved that the notch was responsible for the observed circumferential failure of aligned <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> in 63 mm MDPE pipes by testing these <b>butt</b> fusion <b>welds</b> where the internal weld bead was machined off. The failure site for the internal weld bead machined off sample was in the pipe remote from the weld inferring that the material in the melt flow zone does not constitute any weakness. The effect of elevated temperature (79 °C) testing in 63 mm HDPE pipe was found to increase the density (and crystallinity) signifying a slow annealing process in the material. However, the changes in these parameters were not of sufficient scale to strongly influence the performance. The main effect of elevated temperature testing in water environment appears to be the extraction of stabiliser from the base polymer as was indicated by the rapid decrease in oxidation induction time with the ageing times.

40|$|The fatigue {{behaviour}} of 25 mm aluminium-alloy {{full and}} partial penetration <b>butt</b> <b>welds</b> were investigated. Strain controlled fatigue {{tests of the}} 5083 aluminium-alloy base and 5183 weld metal were carried out to determine the monotonic and cyclic stress-strain properties. Crack propagation measurements were performed using center crack tension specimens. The weldments were tested under axial loading for R= 0 and - 1. For the full-penetration <b>butt</b> <b>welds,</b> the crack initiated at the weld toe, while for the partial penetration <b>butt</b> <b>welds,</b> the crack started at the weld root. The high stress concentration at the weld root decreases the fatigue strength of the welds with UP {{as compared to the}} full penetration <b>butt</b> <b>welds.</b> In presence of a tensile mean stress, the fatigue life is significantly shorter than under fully reversed loading. An analytical model was used to predict the lifetime of the weldments. The total lifetime is composed of crack initiation and crack propagation. Because of the high stress concentration at the weld root the period of crack initiation is negligible for the weldments with UP. The lifetime based on crack propagation can be simply described using the geometry factor of the center crack tension specimen. Considering of the extra material provided by the weld reinforcement is suggested. The model predictions agreed with the experimental results for the full penetration <b>butt</b> <b>welds.</b> While for R= 0, the most lifetime was spent in crack initiation (and small crack growth), for R=- 1 the relative amount of crack propagation is more dominant due to crack closure under compressive loading...|$|R
