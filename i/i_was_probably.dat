5|$|The Stewarts {{attempted}} to follow France and England in building up an artillery train. The abortive siege of Roxborugh in 1436 under James <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> the first conflict {{in which the}} Scots made serious use of artillery. James II had a royal gunner and received gifts of artillery from the continent, including two giant bombards made for Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, one of which, Mons Meg, still survives. Although these were probably already outdated on the continent, they represented impressive military technology when they reached Scotland. James II enthusiasm for artillery cost him his life, and James III also experienced ill-fortune when artillery sent from Sigismund, Archduke of Austria, sank in a storm en route to Scotland in 1481. James IV brought in experts from France, Germany and the Netherlands and established a foundry in 1511. Edinburgh Castle had a house of artillery where visitors could see cannon cast for what became a formidable train, allowing him to send cannon to France and Ireland and to quickly subdue Norham Castle in the Flodden campaign. However, 18 heavy artillery pieces had to be drawn by 400 oxen and slowed the advancing army, proving ineffective against the longer range and smaller calibre English guns at the Battle of Flodden.|$|E
5|$|Edward I had {{the major}} {{ingredients}} for gunpowder shipped to Stirling in 1304, probably {{to produce a}} form of Greek fire, to be shot into the town in earthenware pots by siege engines. The English probably had projectile gunpowder artillery in the 1320s and the Scots by the next decade. The first clear recorded use in Britain was when Edward III besieged Berwick in 1333, where it was used alongside mechanical siege engines. The first use by the Scots was probably against Stirling Castle in 1341. Gunpowder artillery began to fully replace mechanical engines in the late fourteenth century. The Stewarts attempted to follow the French and English crowns in building up an artillery train.

James II had a royal gunner and received gifts of artillery from the continent, including two giant bombards made for Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, one of which, Mons Meg, still survives. Although these were probably already outdated on the continent, they represented impressive military technology when they reached Scotland. James II enthusiasm for artillery cost him his life and demonstrated some {{of the dangers of}} early artillery, when a gun exploded at the siege of Roxburgh in 1460. James III also experienced ill-fortune, when artillery sent from Sigismund, Archduke of Austria sank in a storm en route to Scotland in 1481.

To the point where it has now caused what they call post-traumatic epilepsy. It's not a full-blown epilepsy attack, but more of a dizzy spell, sort of a blackout type.

500|$|By {{the time}} of Divine's birth in 1945, the Milsteads were {{relatively}} wealthy and socially conservative Baptists. Later describing his upbringing, Divine would recollect: [...] "I {{was an only child}} in, I guess, your upper middle-class American family. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> your American spoiled brat." [...] His parents lavished almost anything that he wanted upon him, including food, and he became overweight, a condition he lived with {{for the rest of his}} life. Divine preferred to use his middle name, Glenn, to distinguish himself from his father, and was referred to as such by his parents and friends.|$|E
500|$|From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a {{freelance}} cellist in London. He recalled, [...] "My first orchestral engagement {{was with the}} Queen's Hall Orchestra – <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> the youngest orchestral musician ever, joining them in 1916. We had an enormous repertory – six concerts a week, three hours or more rehearsal a day. In those days we were happy if we began and finished together". While playing in the Queen's Hall Orchestra, Barbirolli also played in the opera pit for the Beecham and Carl Rosa opera companies, in recitals with the pianist Ethel Bartlett, with orchestras in theatres, cinemas, hotels and dance-halls, and, as he said, [...] "everywhere except the street". During {{the last year of}} World War I, Barbirolli enlisted in the army and became a lance-corporal in the Suffolk Regiment. Here he had his first opportunity to conduct, when an orchestra of volunteers was formed. He later described the experience: ...|$|E

They can be found in railroad museums and some are in private hands.|$|R
500|$|King {{has since}} been {{critical}} of his performance, which he describes as his [...] "most lackluster". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Describing himself as [...] "probably the odd man out at that point", he stated he [...] "didn't participate as much because of that". [...] Hanneman said: [...] "We go through dry spells sometimes, but {{the good thing about}} having two guitar players that can write music is that you are never gonna go without. I guess at that time, Kerry was hitting a dry spell." [...] King has also been critical of the album in general, describing it as one of his least favorite Slayer albums. He feels [...] vocalist Tom Araya moved too far away from his regular vocal style, and [...] "added too much singing". Drummer Dave Lombardo has since observed: [...] "There was fire on all the records, but it started dimming when South of Heaven came into the picture. And that's me personally. Again, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> wanting something else." ...|$|E
500|$|Hans Lundgren {{was born}} on 3 November 1957 in Spånga, the son of Sigrid Birgitta (née Tjerneld), a {{language}} teacher, and Karl Johan Hugo Lundgren, an engineer and economist for the Swedish government. He lived in Spånga {{until the age of}} 13, when he moved to his grandparents' home in Nyland, Ångermanland. Some sources wrongly state 1959 as his year of birth, but Lundgren himself has confirmed it to be 1957. He has two sisters and an older brother; he was raised in the Lutheran church. Lundgren claims his father was physically abusive and vented his frustration on his wife and eldest son. He has stated that, during his tirades, his father would call him a [...] "loser", which motivated him later as he grew more ambitious to prove himself. But he also said, [...] "I still love my father, no matter what happened. There are many things about him I still admire. As a child, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> too much like him, very stubborn—perhaps that's what he couldn't deal with." [...] He has cited his troubled relationship with his father as the reason he developed a desire to participate in heavy contact sports such as boxing and karate.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Eminem {{mentioned}} the singer twice on The Eminem Show, his fourth studio album, {{on the tracks}} [...] "Superman" [...] and [...] "When the Music Stops", {{both of which were}} revealed to have been inspired by their relationship in Eminem's 2008 autobiography, The Way I Am. The former track contained the lyrics [...] "What you trying be? My new wife? / What, you Mariah? Fly through twice," [...] while the latter suggested that he begged to be taken back by Carey. Later that year, Eminem confirmed that they had been in a relationship in an interview for Rolling Stone, but claimed to have not been fully committed to it and that he disliked her as a person, while Carey told Maxim that it was never a [...] "sexual relationship" [...] and interviewer Larry King [...] "I hung out with him, I spoke to him on the phone. I think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> with him a total of four times. And I don't consider that dating somebody." [...] Carey recorded a song called [...] "Clown" [...] for Charmbracelet which [...] "ambiguously addressed the relationship" [...] with the lyrics [...] "Should've left it at I like your music too" [...] and [...] "You should've never intimated we were lovers/ When you know very well we never even touched each other." ...|$|E

[...] Matt Burke in Matthew Burke: A Football Life recounts that, [...] "We ended up winning the game 19-12 - and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> only one pass short of scoring a debut Test match try. David Campese put a pass over to Tim Horan, who carried it on and scored in the corner." ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael Glenn Chugg {{was born}} on 15 June 1947 in Launceston to Victor Chugg and Lorna (née Hancock). Chugg was the eldest of four children, while his grandmother, Ella Chugg, was his [...] "best friend". He credits his {{great-grandfather}} with his idiosyncratic use of profanity [...] "the {{first thing he did}} was taught me to swear. And it's always been a major part of my delivery of things. There might have been one or two instance over the 40 years where <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> out of order but in the main it's usually been because it needed to be done".

The latter's son Solomon had a {{deciding}} {{voice in}} the appointments to the gaonate of Sura in the years 733 and 759 [...] Isaac Iskawi I died very soon after Solomon. In the dispute between David's sons Anan and Hananiah regarding the succession the latter was victor; Anan then proclaimed himself anti-exilarch, was imprisoned, and founded the etc. of the Karaites. So says the Jewish Encyclopedia of 1906; {{the origin of the}} Karaites is not uncontroversial. His descendants were regarded by the Karaites as the true exilarchs. The following list of Karaite exilarchs, father being succeeded always by son, is given in the genealogy of one of these [...] "Karaite princes": Anan, Saul, Josiah, Boaz, Jehoshaphat, David, Solomon, Hezekiah, Hasdai, Solomon II. Anan's brother Hananiah is not mentioned in this list.|$|E
2500|$|Ray Collins {{rejoined the}} Mothers of Invention for the {{recording}} of the album, as his high falsetto was suited for the recordings. According to Collins, [...] "I brought the 'style of being raised in Pomona, California, being raised on the Four Aces, the Four Freshmen, Frankie Lane, Frank Sinatra and Jesse Baldwin. The early influences of R came into the Southern California area when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> in the tenth grade in high school. And I remember Peter Potter's show, and I think I recall the first R tune on there was 'Oop-Shoop'. Frank actually had more influences from the 'real blues', you know, like Muddy Waters, those kind of people. But I wasn't into that in my early life. I was more of the pop culture, pop radio things, and it's always been more of a favourite of mine than the early blues stuff - even though I love John Lee Hooker and all those people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wallace {{was raised}} as a Presbyterian. In college, however, he became {{increasingly}} dissatisfied with organized religion after reading William James' The Varieties of Religious Experience (1902). Around 1919 he stopped attending the Presbyterian church {{and spent the}} next ten years exploring other religious faiths and traditions, including spiritualism and esoteric religion. He later said, [...] "I know I am often called a mystic, and in the years following my leaving the United Presbyterian Church <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> a practical mystic ... I'd say I was a mystic in the sense that George Washington Carver was – who believed God was in everything and therefore, if you went to God, you could find the answers." [...] Wallace joined the Theosophical Society on June 6, 1925, and that same year helped organize a Des Moines parish of the Liberal Catholic Church, a denomination with ties to theosophy, but which had no ties to the Roman Catholic Church. He resigned from the Theosophical Society on or before November 23, 1935, and in 1939 formally joined the Episcopal Church.|$|E

From the shadows <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> {{in the best position}} to study its effect and I realised that he had failed to achieve his object: for while General von Wietersheim [...] was the only one to find his tongue enough to show by his questions how little he agreed with what Hitler had outlined, this in itself probably crystallised in Hitler's mind the suspicion that he was confronted with an iron phalanx of men who inwardly refused to be swayed by any speech they thought was just a propaganda speech.Keitel believed that Hitler's [...] "pronounced distaste for the General Staff" [...] and [...] "its 'caste' arrogance", which would become something of an obsession of his later, was in part a result of this meeting and Wietersheim's comments. Hitler no doubt considered Wietersheim's disagreements with him as a kind of treason: in 1946 Manstein told the Nuremberg tribunal that after the August 1938 incident Hitler no longer allowed the military to directly question any of his decisions.|$|E
2500|$|When Rob Liefeld, one of Image's co-founders, {{split from}} the {{publisher}} and formed his own company Awesome Entertainment, he hired Moore {{to create a new}} universe for the characters he had brought with him from Image.

[...] Moore began writing comics for many of these characters, such as Glory and Youngblood, as well as a three-part mini-series known as Judgment Day to provide a basis for the Awesome Universe. Moore was not satisfied with Liefeld, saying [...] "I just got fed up with the unreliability of information that I get from him, that I didn't trust him. I didn't think that he was respecting the work and I found it hard to respect him. And also by then <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>probably</b> feeling that with the exception of Jim Lee, Jim Valentino – people like that – that a couple of the Image partners were seeming, to my eyes, to be less than gentlemen. They were seeming to be not necessarily the people I wanted to deal with." ...|$|E
