50|$|The second {{big change}} started in 1780 with the {{founding}} of Busby's first cotton mill. This was at Newmill, on Cartsbridge lands {{on the opposite side}} of the River Cart. Busby and Newmill each had several earlier mills. Busby itself had Busby Meal Mill at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>Field</b> Road (founded before 1300), and Busby Waulk Mill in the Glen. Newmill also had two mills, situated together at the waterfall. The first was another early Meal Mill and the second a more recent Lint Mill. The cotton mill built in 1780 was on a completely different scale to the old rural mills. It attracted many families to settle in the area, and the centre of Busby swung from the old declining fermtoun on the Lanarkshire side of the River Cart, to Newmill on the Renfrewshire side.|$|E

Until this point, the Mann Cup was a {{challenge}} trophy, mostly dominated by British Columbia's New Westminster Salmonbellies, in 1926 the entire country could compete for the trophy in a playdown style. As standings leaders of the OALA at midpoint, the Weston Westonmen were awarded the right to represent the OALA for the Mann Cup. The Westonmen were met by the Winnipeg Tigers, whom they defeated 11-3 {{to become the first}} Mann Cup champion of the playdown era. The Westonmen were then forced to face the Brampton Excelsiors in the Ontario final who beat them 10-goals-to-6 in a two-game series. The Westonmen would dominate the Ontario scene in the 1920s with 5 league titles and the 1926 Mann Cup. In 1931, the Excelsiors defeated the Toronto Native Sons 2-games-to-1 to win the OALA championship. The Excelsiors would go on to defeat New Westminster in the Mann Cup final 2-games-to-1. This marked the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>Field</b> Lacrosse for this league and the last Mann Cup to ever be conducted on a field.|$|E

Secondly, candidate point group was determined by looking for the critical point of peak from the lowest trough point to un-harvested field and associating with the detection result of the anterior frame. Lastly, navigation line was obtained by using passing a Known Point Hough Transform (PKPHT). Results show that the navigation line detected using this algorithm can fit the boundary line and the edge of field accurately, the average processing time is 56. 10 ms/f, and the algorithm can meet the actual production needs of cotton harvester...|$|E

40|$|Long liquid slugs {{reaching}} {{a length of}} several hundreds of pipe diameter may appear when transporting gas and liquid in horizontal or nearly horizontal pipelines. These long slugs may cause system vibration, separator flooding, and operational problems for the downstream processing facilities. Although mainly short hydrodynamic slugs have been observed in offshore gas and oil production fields over the past years, {{the appearance of the}} long slugs is becoming more common as many production fields are now more mature and reach <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>field</b> life, giving reduced production rates and reduced operational pressure. In this paper we investigate the effect of gas pulsation at the pipeline inlet on the length and frequency of long slugs for gas–liquid flow in horizontal pipelines. Experiments have been carried out in a 137 m long air–water horizontal flow loop with an internal diameter of 0. 052 m. The results show a strong relation between the frequency of gas pulsation and the resulting slug flow. Particularly gas pulsation can decrease the size of the long liquid slugs significantly...|$|E

The Terric Histosol (HSs) was investigated in this research, and the treatments of former different land-use in Radviliškis site.

After 12 years since the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>field</b> experiment the differences in soil chemical composition remained still between treatments of differently used peat soil. Due to mineralization, the content of soil organic matter (SOM) and SOC respectively decreased, the largest amounts of SOC are stored in the upper soil layer of perennial grasses fertilized with NPK (NPK), there was the highest yield of biomass; and accordingly, the lowest content of SOC – in soil of un-used peat (UU). The distribution of total N and P in profile of Terric Histosol is directly related to the vertical gradient of mineralization intensity; higher amounts of N and P have been accumulated where mineralization was more intense. The distribution of total K is related to land-use of Terric Histosol, whereas the biggest quantity of total K was established in arable land which has been fertilized with mineral fertilisers...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} satisfy the {{agricultural}} demond of rice transplanting, the transplanter work should guarantee the escapement even in straight line transplanting that is convenient for field management and harvest later. Because of variable soil conditions and hard work environment, the driver driving level and the long boring driving to follow line is a big influence {{to the accuracy of}} the rice transplant. It is easy to produce overline, leak line and cause losses in yield. Aimed at above problem, this text introduces an automatic navigation system developed on PZ 60 rice transplanter based on global navigation satellite system (GNSS). The steering, transmission and transplanting control system of the rice transplanter were modified from manual control system to electro-hydraulic control system using electro-hydraulic proportional valve. According to the position information of the rice transplanter acquired from GNSS receiver and vehicle sensors, the close-loop feedback control system of steering was builded. The system can accurately control rice transplanter to follow row navigating and turn around at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>field</b> by the self-adaptive fuzzy control method. The road and field experiment results indicated that the lateral tracking error could be kept within 100 mm when the speed of the rice transplant is not greater than 1. 0 m/s.

40|$|Background: Inappropriate feeding {{is one of}} {{the major}} causes of {{malnutrition}} in children. This study was carried out to get an insight into mothers’ views and beliefs about the role of complementary feeding in children under the age of two. Materials and Methods: In this qualitative study, data were collected through 11 focus-group discussions (FGDs) with mothers, who had children under the age of two, in urban and rural areas of Damavand in 2007. Each FGD was held in the presence of a moderator, two note takers, and an observer. At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>field</b> work, all notes were collected and coded according to the objectives of the study. Then the subgroups for each objective were obtained, and emerging themes were extracted and reported. Results: In the study, six general themes were identified:(1) The mothers viewed complementary feeding as simple, soft, light foods which are especially made for children; (2) the best time for introducing complementary feeding was 6 months of age; (3) there were no complementary local foods in Damavand; (4) for children under the age of one, a different type of food was separately prepared; (5) home-made complementary food was preferred over the ready made type, and (6) children were fed with table food from the first year of life. Conclusion: Despite their sufficient knowledge about the advantages of complementary feeding, the majority of mothers, due to some socio-cultural limitations, had a weak performance. In this regard, in addition to making revisions in current training programs and protocols, providing effective and goal-oriented educational programs for mothers and others who take care of children is strongly recommended...|$|E

40|$|The article {{studies the}} festivities and {{holidays}} of the Estonian folk calendar, and {{their position in}} the yearly cycle. The author makes an attempt to indicate that the position of feast days and holidays in the calendar is not random, but follow a specific and clearly perceptible system. The system and, particularly, the specific dates of the holidays are based on an astronomical-mathematical construction rather than the climate and/or agricultural activities, which has been generally believed so far. This explains why the calendar holidays of several European countries coincide, regardless of the differences in life style and tradition. A closer look is taken on four Estonian folk calendar holidays, which date back to the period before Christianity: taliharjapäev (Jan. 14, the day when the backbone of winter is broken), künnipäev (April 14, the day marking the beginning of field activities), karusepäev (July 13) and kolletamispäev (Oct. 14, marking the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>field</b> activities). These days fit in the calendar system which divides a year in sixteen parts, which have been associated with prehistoric, astronomically oriented megalithic constructions in Europe. This calendar system may have been known in Estonia, suggesting that similar astronomically positioned constructions could exist here; though, as far as it is known, archaeologists have not discovered any thus far. The article also discusses the role of folk calendar holidays in today's society. The fact that the Estonian folk calendar largely originates from the period of agrarian society explains why former traditions have lost their significance in modern urbanised life. However, since the article argues that many folk calendar holidays are based on specific astronomical phenomena rather than the cycle of agrarian activities, these holidays may not have lost their meaning and role in a modern, considerably transformed cultural environment...|$|E
