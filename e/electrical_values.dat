50|$|In analog systems, each {{horizontal}} line is transmitted as a high-frequency analog signal. Each picture element (pixel) is therefore converted to an analog <b>electrical</b> <b>value</b> (voltage), {{and changes in}} values between pixels therefore become changes in voltage. The transmission standards require that the sampling {{be done in a}} fixed time (outlined below), so more pixels per line becomes a requirement for more voltage changes per unit time, i.e. higher frequency. Since such signals are typically band-limited by cables, amplifiers, recorders, transmitters, and receivers, the band-limitation on the analog signal acts as an effective low-pass filter on the spatial resolution. The difference in resolutions between VHS (240 discernible lines per scanline), Betamax (280 lines), and the newer ED Beta format (500 lines) is explained primarily by the difference in the recording bandwidth.|$|R
