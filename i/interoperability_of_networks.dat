Integration in Manufacturing (IiM) is the first systemic paradigm to organise humans and machines as a whole system, not only at the field level, but also, at the management and corporate levels, to produce an integrated and interoperable enterprise system. Business process software and Manufacturing Execution Systems are now available to meet the requirements of this fully computerised and automated integration.
