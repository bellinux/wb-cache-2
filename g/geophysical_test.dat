40|$|The {{accurate}} numerical {{prediction of}} vibrations in {{the built environment}} requires the detailed knowledge of the dynamic soil characteristics. Even for relatively simple cases, however, {{it is difficult to}} obtain soil parameters that result in good prediction accuracy, especially in the high frequency range. The present project focuses on the quantification and reduction of parameter uncertainty related to dynamic soil characteristics. Parameter uncertainty is due to the limited resolution of <b>geophysical</b> <b>tests</b> that result in an imprecise characterization of thedynamic soil properties. The first part of the research will concentrate on the development of a Bayesian updating procedure for the Spectral Analysis of Surface Waves (SASW) method to determine the shear wave velocity and other characteristics as Poisson’s ratio and the material damping ratios. As the exploration depth of the SASW method is limited,complementary SCPT tests, passive surface wave tests and the H/V methodwill be used to infer properties of deeper soil layers. The geophysicalinformation from different tests is combined, implicitly accounting forthe accuracy of the different <b>geophysical</b> <b>tests.</b> The final outcome of the combined Bayesian updating procedure is an ensemble of probable dynamic soil characteristics, {{that can be used in}} a forward stochastic analysis of vibrations in the built environment. status: accepte...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} project carried {{out during the}} PhD work aims to study {{the effectiveness of the}} OhmMapper (Geometrics Inc.) capacitive-coupled resistivity system in archaeological contexts. In order to verify the effectiveness of this resistivity-meter to identify archaeological features, we realized a systematic surveys in the <b>Geophysical</b> <b>Test</b> Site of Rovereto (TN - Italy). In particular we compared both resistance and resistivity profiles realized by OhmMapper capacitively coupled resistivity-meter and by the Terrameter SAS 1000 (ABEM) galvanic resistivity meter.

The comparison between the profile realized by the two different instruments allowed us to establish the reliability of the OhmMapper to detect targets characterized by vertical pattern and resistivity values grater than the context. After this analysis, we realized several resistivity surveys in archaeological sites using the OhmMapper. In particular the surveys carried out in five archaeological sites are the most appropriate to demonstrate the effectiveness of the instrument, because the resistivity results are comparable with other archaeological or geophysical data. Two of these sites are located in modern urban contexts (Sacred Area of Medma Greek colony and the roman Aqueduct of Florence); the other three sites are located in suburban areas (Late-ancient villa near Siena, Accademia of Villa Adriana and Sentinum roman town) ...|$|E

In this seismic refraction study, {{we have used}} 9 shot-points for inline and 10 shot-points for offset in pur pose to obtaine high resolution of seismic refraction tomography. During a recent <b>geophysical</b> <b>test</b> site, the subsurface material was mapped along survey line using seismic refraction method.

The upper layer has velocity values with range of 500 m/s to 1500 m/s which can be classified as unconsolidated surface deposits and mixtures of unsaturated sands and grav els. Meanwhile the lower layer has velocity values with range of 2000 m/s to 5500 m/s which is classified as compacted fine’s soil due to high pressure of the overburden. Analysis of seismic refraction data demonstrated that refraction to mography software systems are able to reveal subsurface material which represented by their seismic velocity value. Furthermore, the velocity model obtained in this study is agreed with its synthetic modelling result as initial model.

Performance in detection and localization of concrete tubes and steel tanks is compared {{as a function}} of acquisition configuration. The comparison is done using 100 MHz and 200 MHz center frequency antennas. All tubes and tanks are buried at the <b>geophysical</b> <b>test</b> site of IAG/USP in Sao Paulo city, Brazil. The results show that the long steel pipe with a 38 -mm diameter was well detected with the perpendicular broadside configuration. The concrete tubes were better detected with the parallel broadside configuration, clearly showing hyperbolic diffraction events from all targets up to 2 -m depth. Steel tanks were detected with the two configurations. However, the parallel broadside configuration was generated to a much lesser extent an apparent hyperbolic reflection corresponding to constructive interference of diffraction hyperbolas of adjacent targets placed at the same depth. Vertical concrete tubes and steel tanks were better contained with parallel broadside antennas, where the apexes of the diffraction hyperbolas better corresponded to the horizontal location of the buried target disposition. The two configurations provide details about buried targets emphasizing how GPR multi-component configurations have the potential to improve the subsurface image quality as well as to discriminate different buried targets. It is judged that they hold some applicability in geotechnical and geoscientific studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|An {{engineering}} geological map can {{be defined}} as a geological map with a generalized representation of all the components of a geological environment which are strongly required for spatial planning, design, construction and maintenance of civil engineering buildings. In Wallonia (Belgium) 24 engineering geological maps have been developed between the 70 s and the 90 s at 1 / 5, 000 or 1 / 10, 000 scale covering some areas of the most industrialized and urbanized cities (Liège, Charleroi and Mons). They were based on soil and subsoil data point (boring, drilling, penetration test, <b>geophysical</b> <b>test,</b> outcrop...). Some displayed data present the depth (with isoheights) or the thickness (with isopachs) of the different subsoil layers up to about 50 m depth. Information about geomechanical properties of each subsoil layer,useful for engineers and urban planners, is also synthesized. However, these maps were built up only on paper and progressively needed to be updated with new soil and subsoil data. The Public Service of Wallonia and the University of Liège have recently initiated a study to evaluate the feasibility to develop engineering geological mapping with a computerized approach. Numerous and various data (about soil and subsoil) are stored into a georelational database (the geotechnical database – using Access, Microsoft®). All the data are geographically referenced. The database is linked to a GIS project (using ArcGIS, ESRI®). Both the database and GIS project consist of a powerful tool for spatial data management and analysis. This approach involves a methodology using interpolation methods to update the previous maps and to extent the coverage to new areas. The location (x, y, z) of each subsoil layer is then computed from data point. The geomechanical data of these layers are synthesized in an explanatory booklet joined to maps...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} investigates iterative {{methods for}} solving large and sparse least squares problems, as those encountered in tomography. A widely used method for such systems is the Conjugate Gradients method for Least Squares problems (CGLS), which {{is derived from}} the popular Conjugate Gradient method. The Conjugate Residuals method can also be adapted for Least Squares problems, which would lead to the Conjugate Residual Least Square method (CRLS). Such a method seems to be unknown. In this thesis we derive the method of Conjugate Residuals for the Least Square problem and compare it to other iterative methods like Conjugate Gradients, Conjugate Gradients for the Least Square problem, Conjugate Residuals, Least Square Minimal Residual (LSMR) and Least Square QR-factorization (LSQR). Also a non-iterative method, the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is tested and compared to this iterative methods. A test problem that provides ill conditioned problems is used to test the accuracy of the methods. It can be concluded that CRLS behaves significantly worse with this test problem than the methods SVD, CGLS, LSQR and LSMR, if it is implemented in its most time efficient way. Its accuracy is comparable to the methods CG and CR. If the implementation is altered the accuracy improves up {{to the level of the}} other algorithms, but this implementation requires an extra matrix multiplication. This means the investigated method can achieve high accuracy, but may require more time and memory while computing a solution. In the application of the discussed algorithms on a representative <b>geophysical</b> <b>test</b> problem the accuracy problem of CRLS cannot be detected. Even the time-efficient implementation does not result in loss of accuracy in comparison with CGLS in this test problem. After adding perturbation to the measured data of this problem, it is clear that CRLS is also in this area comparable to CGLS.

40|$|When {{multiple}} <b>geophysical</b> <b>tests</b> {{are performed}} in a well the resulting suite of logs form a set of multivariate data. It is commonly known {{that many of the}} <b>geophysical</b> <b>tests</b> respond to similar, and often inter-related geologic factors. While cross-plotting can be used to study relationships between pairs of logs, it fails to clearly present the relationships within the data. Principal Components Analysis (PCA), however, can provide additional insight by transforming the log data into a new orthogonal, yet simplified, coordinate system. The process of PCA involves three main steps: log correlation analysis, eigenvector interpretation, and component score cross-plotting. From this process the log analyst can gain an understanding of the factors controlling the variation within the data, and determine the uniqueness of the electrofacies encountered in the borehole. The PCA technique was applied to suites of logs from the Kitchener-Waterloo region of Southern Ontario. Previous analysis of the data included cross plotting of the various logs to determine the uniqueness of the lithofacies. The first stage of the PCA, correlation analysis, indicated the dominance of porosity and clay content variation. The correlation between density and porosity, however, varied significantly between wells. Eigenvector interpretation indicated that 78 percent of the total data variation was described by the first two principal components (63 and 15 percent, respectively), confirming the high degree of inter-relationship between the log measurements.

40|$|A {{significant}} {{open issue}} concerning {{the reliability of}} geophysical methods and in particular of ground penetrating radar (GPR), both in research and professional context, is {{a general lack of}} international standards. This is a major problem to be faced, in order to gain scientific strictness for the GPR practices, and to easily extend to the international community the results achieved within the area of single virtuous countries. Producing international guidelines can represent an important step forward, in this sense. In the memorandum of understanding of the COST Action TU 1208 is clearly stated that one of the main purposes of the Action is the “development of innovative protocols and guidelines which will be published in a handbook and constitute a basis for European Standards, for an effective GPR application in CE tasks; safety, economic and financial criteria will be integrated within the protocols”. Of course this is not a simple task to be accomplished. Firstly, survey procedures are highly dependent on the objective of the survey itself. On the basis of the objective of each <b>geophysical</b> <b>test,</b> the GPR system, the antenna configuration, and even the processing procedures may change. Besides, these procedures are also influenced by the environmental conditions in which the tests are performed. This affects several aspects spanning from hardware to software, but including, for instance, also safety issues. Due to these reasons, one of the main goal of the COST Action TU 1208 is the development of several guidelines related to the main applications of GPR in the field of civil engineering. In this work, the structure of a guidelines handbook for GPR activities in tunnels is outlined. In the first sections, the principal references in the field are provided, and the most common GPR equipment and complementary technologies are described. Subsequently, the survey methodologies are explained. Particular attention is paid to the preliminary activities to be carried out prior to the GPR surveys, which can cover an important role in such a complex environment. Lastly, the main applications of GPR technology in tunnels are discussed.

40|$|Presented in {{this thesis}} are two studies that apply {{nondestructive}} testing methods to civil engineering problems. The first study examines {{the relationship between the}} small-strain and large-strain properties of exhumed cast iron water pipes. Nondestructive and destructive testing programs were performed on eight pipes varying in age from 40 to 130 years. New applications of frequency domain analysis techniques including Fourier and wavelet transforms of ultrasonic pulse velocity measurements are presented. The effects of Lamb wave propagation on the ultrasonic testing results are investigated. Microstructure evaluation revealed two different types of cast iron within the pipes sampled: grey cast iron and ductile iron. A low correlation between wave propagation and large-strain measurements was observed. However, the wave velocities were consistently different between ductile and grey cast iron pipes (14 % to 18 % difference). Lamb waves were found to contribute significantly to the frequency content of the ultrasonic signals possibly resulting in the poor correlations observed. Therefore, correlations between wave velocities and large strain properties obtained using samples from exhumed water pipes must be used with caution in the condition assessment of aged water pipes especially for grey cast iron pipes. The second study presented {{in this thesis}} was performed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} three geophysical methods for geotechnical site characterization in swamps and environmentally sensitive wetland areas. The geophysical methods evaluated were electrical resistivity imaging (ERI), seismic refraction (SR), and multiple-channel analysis of surface waves (MASW). The <b>geophysical</b> <b>test</b> results were verified against the results from borehole and CPT logs. The ERI results were best for determining the depth to the glacial till. The SR results overestimated the depth to the till because of the presence of a stiffness reversal. The MASW results predicted the depth to the refusal till layer less accurately than the ERI method. However, this method was able to detect the three distinct layers above the till. These methods can be used as a basis for further development to optimize a procedure to reduce the number of boreholes required for conventional site investigations in areas that are environmentally sensitive or where access is restricted...|$|E
40|$|In Part I of this dissertation, {{equivalent}} {{static analysis}} (ESA) procedures for computing foundation demands during lateral spreading {{are applied to}} two parallel bridges that were damaged during the 2010 M 7. 2 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake in Baja California, Mexico. A railroad bridge span collapsed, whereas the adjacent highway bridge survived with one support pier near the river having modest flexural cracking of cover concrete. Cone penetration and <b>geophysical</b> <b>test</b> results are presented along with geotechnical and structural conditions evaluated from design documents. ESA using a beam-on-Winkler foundation model is found to accurately predict observed responses when liquefaction-compatible inertia demands are represented as spectral displacements that account for resistance from other bridge components. Pier columns for the surviving bridge effectively resisted lateral spreading demands {{in part because of}} restraint provided by the superstructure. Collapse of the surviving bridge is incorrectly predicted when inertial demands are computed for the individual bent in isolation from other components, and are represented by forces that do not consider global restraint. In Part II, results of a parametric study of the influence of kinematic pile-soil interaction on foundation-input motions (FIM) are presented. One-dimensional nonlinear ground response analysis was used to define free-field motions, which were subsequently imposed on a beam-on-nonlinear-dynamic-Winkler-foundation pile model. The free-field ground surface motion (FFM) and top-of-pile “foundation-input motion” (FIM) computed from these results were then used to compute transfer functions and spectral ratios for use with the substructure method of seismic analysis. A total of 1, 920 parametric combinations of different pile sizes, soil profiles, and ground motions were analyzed. Results of the study show that significant reductions of the FFM occur for stiff piles in soft soil, which could result in a favorable reduction in design demands for short-period structures. Group effects considering spatially-variable (incoherent) ground motions are found to be modest over the footprint of a typical bridge bent, resulting in an additional reduction of FFM by 10 percent or less compared to an equivalent single pile. This study aims to overcome limitations of idealistic assumptions that have been employed in previous studies such as linear-elastic material behavior, drastically simplified stratigraphy, and harmonic oscillations in lieu of real ground motions. In order to capture the important influence of more realistic conditions such as material nonlinearity, subsurface heterogeneity, and variable frequency-content ground motions, a set of models for predicting transfer functions and spectral ratios has been developed through statistical regression of the results from this parametric study. These allow foundation engineers to predict kinematic pile-soil interaction effects without performing dynamic pile analyses...|$|E

40|$|To reduce traffic {{problems}} {{and to improve}} the social climate in Maastricht a tunnel will be constructed for the A 2 motorway. The tunnel will be construction with the cut-and-cover method. Before the constructions starts first a ground improvement campaign is performed. Afterwards sheet pile walls will be installed in cemented slurry trenches and the building pit will be excavated dry wherever possible. The subsurface in Maastricht consist of a top soil of sand and clay and a thick gravel layer on top of limestone. The water level in Maastricht is generally high. Goal of this report {{is to determine the}} geotechnical and geological risks related to the tunnel construction. The Formation of Maastricht consists of weak porous limestone with flint and hardground layers. The limestone can be affected by dissolution, weathering by groundwater flow, erosion due to the Meuse River or be faulted and reduced to carbonate sand. Problems with excavation, leakage of slurry, lack of bearing capacity and passive resistance and uplift of the building pit floor or high groundwater inflow are expected. In this report the extensive preliminary site and laboratory investigation is described. This investigation had the goal to assess geohazards and to identify the most promising techniques for further investigation phases. Various databases were exploited to map the fluctuations of the gravel-calcarenite interface. Characteristic horizons made it possible to make a member division for the Formation of Maastricht. Vertical displacement of members between adjacent boreholes revealed the presence of a fault. The cores did not only contain rocks but also carbonate sands. Pocket penetrometer test performed on cores at close spacing allowed an objective mapping of the spatial distribution of carbonate sands, very weak and weak calcarenite along the tunnel alignment. These results have been correlated to the UCS results. Beside that a correlation between carbonate sand and fault zones has been detected. At the fault location, analyses of groundwater chemistry confirmed the connection between deep and shallow limestone layers. Many <b>geophysical</b> <b>test</b> methods were performed in a pilot zone, above the detected fault. The seismic reflection conducted with a low energy airsound source was found to be useful to image the fault. It revealed the presence of a complex fault zone rather than a single fault. The north east orientation of the fault zone was interpreted based on regional fault trends and correlated to fractures measured in boreholes {{with the help of a}} borehole camera. Estimating in situ permeability and deformability remained difficult. Primary permeability was found to vary over 3 orders of magnitude, up to the in situ permeability measured with the Lugeon test. In the fault zone a higher permeability is expected. For each member the distribution of material properties is studied and the flint content per member is estimated based on the borehole logs. Of the stratigraphy, lithofacies and some material properties a 3 D model has been constructed, to image and analyse the subsurface. These models are found to be useful since stronger and weaker zones can be recognized and since they can be used for future investigations of for example groundwater flows.

40|$|Instability {{phenomena}} {{in the urban}} environment and their consequences on infrastructures are a very topical issue in engineering practice. There {{are a lot of}} technical solutions on the market and, among these, consolidation techniques have assumed a role of primary importance. Due to the effectiveness of the intervention, the reduced invasiveness and especially the implementation and integration of monitoring techniques like the geophysical method of time-lapse 3 D electrical resistivity tomography and geotechnical tests like dynamic penetration tests (Morelli et al., 2006, Santarato et al., 2011), the injections of expanding resins {{are one of the most}} established among consolidation methods. This work tries to deepen knowledge about physical and mechanical changes in the subsoil after consolidation with expanding resins. The research is divided into two main branches: experimental tests on a controlled test site and continuous data analysis on a wide archive of data, kindly provided by a specialized company operating in the market. Geological, geotechnical and <b>geophysical</b> <b>test</b> have been carried out in the test site in order to obtain a detailed picture of the physical and mechanical properties of the undisturbed state. In particular CPT tests, geotechnical laboratory testing, 2 D and 3 D electrical resistivity tomography, MASW were carried out. The experimental tests were carried out in three main phases. In the first one the effects induced by injections on the mechanical properties of the involved materials have been studied. In the second one the effects induced on the electrical properties and in the last one the possible relationship between the physical and mechanical properties measured after the injections have been studied. From the mechanical point of view, obtained results shows remarkable increases in load-bearing capacity of subsoils, in the ability to fill voids and the consequent migration of the interstitial water. The results also show the effectiveness of the 3 D electrical resistivity tomography in the three-dimensional and temporal evolution monitoring of the phenomena taking place in the subsoil during the injections, as well as a good relationship between electrical and mechanical properties after the consolidation. Before the analysis of case histories a rigorous and careful data sorting work aims to generate datasets as homogeneous as possible. The data is classified by buildings properties (number of floors, presence of basements, topographical variations, etc [...] ), soil properties (detected in situ by the geologist), presence of groundwater, etc [...] Both 3 D electrical resistivity tomography and dynamic penetration tests are performed before and after the injections. Electrical resistivity and dynamic cone resistance percentage change is then calculated. The obtained results show that there is a high percentage of cases in which the curve of the percentage change of the electrical resistivity is similar to the curve of the dynamic cone resistance percentage change. This work aims to improve our understanding on the effects induced in the subsoil by the expanding resins injections. The research has led to better understand, in quantitative terms, physical and mechanical changes that occur as a result of expanding resins injections and to increase knowledge about the response of the 3 D ERT applied to the monitoring of the consolidation process. Thanks to the large amount of case histories analyzed, results clearly demonstrate a relationship between the ERT geophysical method and the dynamic cone penetration test...|$|E
40|$|Mankind {{is facing}} the problem due to {{earthquake}} hazard since prehistoric times. Many of the developed and developing countries are under constant threats from earthquakes hazards. Theories of plate tectonics and engineering seismology have helped to understand earthquakes and also to predicate earthquake hazards on a regional scale. However, the regional scale hazard mapping in terms of seismic zonation has been not fully implemented {{in many of the}} developing countries like India. Agglomerations of large population in the Indian cities and poor constructions have raised the risk due to various possible seismic hazards. First and foremost step towards hazard reduction is estimation of the seismic hazards in regional scale. Objective {{of this study is to}} estimate the seismic hazard parameters for Lucknow, a part of Indo-Gangetic Basin (IGB) and develop regional scale microzonation map. Lucknow is a highly populated city which is located close to the active seismic belt of Himalaya. This belt came into existence during the Cenozoic era (40 - 50 million years ago) and is a constant source of seismic threats. Many of the devastating earthquakes which have happened since prehistoric times such as 1255 Nepal, 1555 Srinagar, 1737 Kolkata, 1803 Nepal, 1833 Kathmandu, 1897 Shillong, 1905 Kangra, 1934 Bihar-Nepal, 1950 Assam and 2005 Kashmir. Historic evidences show that many of these earthquakes had caused fatalities even up to 0. 1 million. At present, in the light of building up strains and non-occurrence of a great event in between 1905 Kangra earthquake and 1934 Bihar-Nepal earthquake regions the stretch has been highlighted as central seismic gap. This location may have high potential of great earthquakes in the near future. Geodetic studies in these locations indicate a possible slip of 9. 5 m which may cause an event of magnitude 8. 7 on Richter scale in the central seismic gap. Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh has a population of 2. 8 million as per Census 2011. It lies in ZONE III as per IS 1893 : 2002 and can be called as moderate seismic region. However, the city falls within 350 km radial distance from Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) and active regional seismic source of the Lucknow-Faizabad fault. Considering the ongoing seismicity of Himalayan region and the Lucknow-Faizabad fault, this city is under high seismic threat. Hence a comprehensive study of understanding the earthquake hazards on a regional scale for the Lucknow is needed. In this work the seismic microzonation of Lucknow has been attempted. The whole thesis is divided into 11 chapters. A detailed discussion on the importance of this study, seismicity of Lucknow, and methodology adopted for detailed seismic hazard assessment and microzonation are presented in first three chapters. Development of region specific Ground Motion Prediction Equation (GMPE) and seismic hazard estimation at bedrock level using highly ranked GMPEs are presented in Chapters 4 and 5 respectively. Subsurface lithology, measurement of dynamic soil properties and correlations are essential to assess region specific site effects and liquefaction potential. Discussion on the experimental studies, subsurface profiling using geotechnical and geophysical tests results and correlation between shear wave velocity (SWV) and standard penetration test (SPT) N values are presented in Chapter 6. Detailed shear wave velocity profiling with seismic site classification and ground response parameters considering multiple ground motion data are discussed in Chapters 7 and 8. Chapters 9 and 10 present the assessment of liquefaction potential and determination of hazard index with microzonation maps respectively. Conclusions derived from each chapter are presented in Chapter 11. A brief summary of the work is presented below: Attenuation relations or GMPEs are important component of any seismic hazard analysis which controls accurate prediction of the hazard values. Even though the Himalayas have experienced great earthquakes since ancient times, suitable GMPEs which are applicable for a wide range of distance and magnitude are limited. Most of the available regional GMPEs were developed considering limited recorded data and/or pure synthetic ground motion data. This chapter presents development of a regional GMPE considering both the recorded as well as synthetic ground motions. In total 14 earthquakes consisting of 10 events with recorded data and 4 historic events with Isoseismal maps are used for the same. Synthetic ground motions based on finite fault model have been generated at unavailable locations for recorded events and complete range distances for historic earthquakes. Model parameters for synthetic ground motion were arrived by detailed parametric study and from literatures. A concept of Apparent Stations (AS) has been used to generate synthetic ground motion in a wide range of distance as well as direction around the epicenter. Synthetic ground motion data is validated by comparing with available recorded data and peak ground acceleration (PGA) from Isoseismal maps. A new GMPE has been developed based on two step stratified regression procedure considering the combined dataset of recorded and synthetic ground motions. The new GMPE is validated by comparing with three recently recorded earthquakes events. GMPE proposed in this study is capable of predicting PGA values close to recorded data and spectral acceleration up to period of 2 seconds. Comparison of new GMPE with the recorded data of recent earthquakes shows a good matching of ground motion as well as response spectra. The new GMPE is applicable for wide range of earthquake magnitudes from 5 to 9 on Mw scale. Reduction of future earthquake hazard is possible if hazard values are predicted precisely. A detailed seismic hazard analysis is carried out in this study considering deterministic and probabilistic approaches. New seismotectonic map has been generated for Lucknow considering a radial distance of 350 km around the city centre, which also covers active Himalayan plate boundaries. Past earthquakes within the seismotectonic region have been collected from United State Geological Survey (USGS), Northern California Earthquake Data Centre (NCEDC), Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Seismic Atlas of India and its Environs (SEISAT) etc. A total of 1831 events with all the magnitude range were obtained. Collected events were homogenized, declustered and filtered for Mw ≥ 4 events. A total of 496 events were found within the seismic study region. Well delineated seismic sources are compiled from SEISAT. Superimposing the earthquake catalogue on the source map, a seismotectonic map of Lucknow was generated. A total of 47 faults which have experienced earthquake magnitude of 4 and above are found which are used for seismic hazard analysis. Based on the distribution of earthquake events on the seismotectonic map, two regions have been identified. Region I which shows high density of seismic events in the area in and around of Main Boundary Thrust (MBT) and Region II which consists of area surrounding Lucknow with sparse distribution of earthquake events. Data completeness analysis and estimation of seismic parameter “a” and “b” are carried out separately for both the regions. Based on the analysis, available earthquake data is complete for a period of 80 years in both the regions. Using the complete data set, the regional recurrence relations have been developed. It shows a “b” value of 0. 86 for region I and 0. 9 for Region II which are found comparable with earlier studies. Maximum possible earthquake magnitude in each source has been estimated using observed magnitude and doubly truncated Gutenberg-Richter relation. The study area of Lucknow is divided into 0. 015 o x 0. 015 o grid size and PGA at each grid has been estimated by considering all sources and the three GMPEs. A Matlab code was generated for seismic hazard analysis and maximum PGA value at each grid point was determined and mapped. Deterministic seismic hazard analysis (DSHA) shows that maximum expected PGA values at bedrock level varies from 0. 05 g in the eastern part to 0. 13 g in the northern region. Response spectrum at city centre is also developed up to a period of 2 seconds. Further, Probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) has been carried out and PGA values for 10 % and 2 % probability of exceedence in 50 years have been estimated and mapped. PSHA for 10 % probability shows PGA variation from 0. 035 g in the eastern parts to 0. 07 g in the western and northern parts of Lucknow. Similarly PSHA for 2 % probability of exceedence indicates PGA variation from 0. 07 g in the eastern parts while the northern parts are expecting PGA of 0. 13 g. Uniform hazard spectra are also developed for 2 % and 10 % probability for a period of up to 2 seconds. The seismic hazard analyses in this study show that the northern and western parts of Lucknow are more vulnerable when compared to other part. Bedrock hazard values completely change due to subsoil properties when it reaches the surface. A detailed geophysical and geotechnical investigation has been carried out for subsoil profiling and seismic site classification. The study area has been divided into grids of 2 km x 2 km and roughly one <b>geophysical</b> <b>test</b> using MASW (Multichannel Analysis Surface Wave) has been carried out in each grid and the shear wave velocity (SWV) profiles of subsoil layers are obtained. A total of 47 MASW tests have been carried out and which are uniformly distributed in Lucknow. In addition, 12 boreholes have also been drilled with necessary sampling and measurement of N-SPT values at 1. 5 m interval till a depth of 30 m. Further, 11 more borelog reports are collected from the same agency hired for drilling the boreholes. Necessary laboratory tests are conducted on disturbed and undisturbed soil samples for soil classification and density measurement. Based on the subsoil informations obtained from these boreholes, two cross-sections up to a depth of 30 m have been generated. These cross-sections show the presence of silty sand in the top 10 m at most of the locations followed by clayey sand of low to medium compressibility till a depth of 30 m. In between the sand and clay traces of silt were also been found in many locations. In addition to these boreholes, 20 deeper boreholes (depth ≥ 150 m) are collected from Jal Nigam (Water Corporation) Lucknow, Government of Uttar Pradesh. Typical cross-section along the alignment of these deeper boreholes has been generated up to 150 m depth. This cross-section shows the presence of fine sand near Gomati while other locations are occupied by surface clayey sand. Also, the medium sand has been found in the western part of the city at a depth of 110 m which continues till 150 m depth. On careful examination of MASW and boreholes with N-SPT, 17 locations are found very close and SWV and N-SPT values are available up to 30 m depth. These SWV and N-SPT values are complied and used to develop correlations between SWV and N-SPT for sandy soil, clayey soil and all soil types. This correlation is the first correlation for IGB soil deposits considered measured data up to 30 m. The new correlation is verified graphically using normal consistency ratio and standard percentage error with respect to measured N-SPT and SWV. Further, SWV and N-SPT profiles are used Another important earthquake induced hazard is liquefaction. Even though many historic earthquakes caused liquefaction in India, very limited attempt has been made to map liquefaction potential in IGB. In this study, a detailed liquefaction analysis has been carried out for Lucknow a part of Ganga Basin to map liquefaction potential. Initially susceptibility of liquefaction for soil deposits has been assessed by comparing the grain size distribution curve obtained from laboratory tests with the range of grain size distribution for potentially liquefiable soils. Most of surface soil deposits in the study area are susceptible to liquefaction. At all the 23 borehole locations, measured N-SPT values are corrected for (a) Overburden Pressure (CN), (b) Hammer energy (CE), (c) Borehole diameter (CB), (d) presence or absence of liner (CS), (e) Rod length (CR) and (f) fines content (Cfines). Surface PGA values at each borehole locations are used to estimate Cyclic Stress Ratio (CSR). Corrected N-SPT values [(N 1) 60 CS] are used to estimate Cyclic Resistance Ratio (CRR) at each layer. CSR and CRR values are used to estimate Factor of Safety (FOS) against liquefaction in each layer. Least factor safety values are indentified from each location and presented liquefaction factor of safety map for average and maximum amplified PGA values. These maps highlight that northern, western and central parts of Lucknow are very critical to critical against liquefaction while southern parts shows moderate to low critical area. The entire alignment of river Gomati falls in very critical to critical regions for liquefaction. Least FOS shows worst scenario and does not account thickness of liquefiable soil layers. Further, these FOS values are used to determine Liquefaction Potential Index (LPI) of each site and developed LPI map. Based on LPI map, the Gomati is found as high to very high liquefaction potential region. Southern and the central parts of Lucknow show low to moderate liquefaction potential while the northern and western Lucknow has moderate to high liquefaction potential. All possible seismic hazards maps for Lucknow have been combined to develop final microzonation map in terms of hazard index values. Hazard index maps are prepared by combining rock PGA map, site classification map in terms of shear wave velocity, amplification factor map, and FOS map and predominant period map by adopting Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). All these parameters have been given here in the order starting with maximum weight of 6 for PGA to lower weight of 1 for predominant frequency. Normalized weights of each parameter have been estimated. Depending upon the variation of each hazard parameter values, three to five ranks are assigned and the normalized ranks are calculated. Final hazard index values have been estimated by multiplying normalized ranks of each parameter with the normalized weights. Microzonation map has been generated by mapping hazard index values. Three maps were generated based on DSHA, PSHA for 2 % and 10 % probability of exceedence in 50 years. Hazard index maps from DSHA and PSHA for 2 % probability show similar pattern. Higher hazard index were obtained in northern and western parts of Lucknow and lower values in others. The new microzonation maps can help in dividing the Lucknow into three parts as high area i. e. North western part, moderate hazard area i. e. central part and low hazard area which covers southern and eastern parts of Lucknow. This microzonation is different from the current seismic code where all area is lumped in one zone without detailed assessment of different earthquake hazard parameters. Finally this study brings out first region specific GMPE considering recorded and synthetic ground monitions for wide range of magnitudes and distances. Proposed GMPE can also be used in other part of the Himalayan region as it matches well with the highly ranked GMPEs. Detailed rock level PGA map has been generated for Lucknow considering DSHA and PSHA. A detailed geotechnical and geophysical experiments are carried out in Lucknow. These results are used to develop correction between SWV and N-SPT values for soil deposit in IGB and site classification maps for the study area. Amplification and liquefaction potential of Lucknow are estimated by considering multiple ground motions data to account different earthquake ground motion amplitude, duration and frequency, which is unique in the seismic microzonation study...|$|E

In this paper the propagation of measurement uncertainties on the estimated values of soil porosity is theoretically evaluated.
