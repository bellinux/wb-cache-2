50|$|This {{is usually}} quoted as the thermal {{resistance}} from junction to {{case of the}} semiconductor device. The units are °C/W. For example, a heatsink rated at 10 °C/W will get 10 °C hotter than the surrounding air when it dissipates 1 Watt of heat. Thus, a heatsink with a low °C/W value is more efficient than a heatsink with a high °C/W value.Given two semiconductor devices in the same package, a lower junction to ambient resistance (RθJ-C) indicates a more efficient device. However, when comparing two devices with different die-free package thermal resistances (Ex. DirectFETTM MT vs wirebond 5x6mm PQFN), their junction to ambient or junction to case resistance values may not correlate directly to their comparative efficiencies. Different semiconductor packages may have different die orientations, different copper(or other metal) mass surrounding the die, different <b>die</b> <b>attach</b> mechanics, and different molding thickness, all of which could yield significantly different junction to case or junction to ambient resistance values, and could thus obscure overall efficiency numbers.|$|E

40|$|Power {{semiconductor}} devices {{are used in}} a wide range of applications. In these applications, power {{semiconductor devices}} are required to handle large currents and as a result they tend to dissipate large amounts of heat. In addition, the device and their attendant packages must be capable of withstanding power cycling for many years. Traditionally, devices have used high lead die attaches for high electrical and thermal conductivity. Now, with the drive in industry to replace lead-contained solder with lead-free solder alternatives, there is a drive to assess lead-free solder to use as the <b>die</b> <b>attach</b> in power device packages. This dissertation assesses the reliability of Sn 3. 5 Ag 0. 8 Cu lead-free <b>die</b> <b>attach</b> under accelerated power cycling conditions, especially the effect of surface finishes from the die and the substrate on <b>die</b> <b>attach</b> reliability because of the thin <b>die</b> <b>attach</b> thickness (< 100 mm), which is expected to increase the influence of intermetallics formed at the interfaces on the joint reliability. The main part of the thesis is to evaluate the power-cycle reliability of Sn 3. 5 Ag 0. 8 Cu <b>die</b> <b>attach</b> in power MOSFET modules subjected to power cycling. Accelerated power cycling tests, failure analysis, thermal transient analysis and thermo-mechanical modeling were conducted. 3 D thermal analysis correlated an increase in the package thermal impedance to the amount of crack propagation and determined that crack initiation is the limiting process under power cycling. In the experiments, die tilt was observed and <b>die</b> <b>attach</b> cracks always occurred near the middle of the bond line on the side with thicker <b>die</b> <b>attach.</b> This is not addressed in typical thermo-mechanical simulations on solder joint reliability. Such simulations predicted that the thinner side exhibits higher stress than the thicker side and were expected to be easier to fail. Microstructural characterization provided evidences that microstructure of <b>die</b> <b>attach</b> changes with thickness. First, a higher Ag 3 Sn concentration was observed in the thinner <b>die</b> <b>attach</b> due to dissolution of Ag from backside die. Second, a more uniform distribution of Ag 3 Sn precipitates exists in the thinner <b>die</b> <b>attach</b> due to faster cooling. So a thinner Sn 3. 5 Ag 0. 8 Cu <b>die</b> <b>attach</b> is more resistant to fatigue failure even under higher stresses...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} and qualifies {{a partial}} thermal impedance measurement technique {{to evaluate the}} thermal behavior of the physical layers close to the die in power electronic assemblies. The measurement approach {{is derived from the}} pulsed heating curve method; nonetheless, the experimental setup proposed here is fitted for a higher sensitivity analysis of die interconnections due to the extraction of the transient thermal impedance at very high current levels and short heating times. Another advantage of this method is that the cooling efficiency of the system has no impact on the sensitivity of the measurements, which makes it particularly suitable for aging monitoring or in-line manufacturing process control. The method is then implemented with power diodes in order to compare the thermal impedance of two power modules with different solder void repartitions.
