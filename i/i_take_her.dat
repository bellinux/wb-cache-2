6000|$|... "And a more {{immediate}} question—-what are we {{to do with your}} sister if she escapes to-night? Shall <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> to Mrs. Henderson?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now you've hit it, my lord. That's {{just what}} I'm {{thinking}} myself. Unless <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> off Gretna Green fashion, I'll never get her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “No {{more than}} mine,” insisted the major; “and you’re {{worrying}} her. Will you hand her over, you selfish man, or must <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> by force?” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Come!' said he, 'I don't {{want to be}} {{told about}} that. I know what <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> for, {{as well as you}} do. Never you mind what <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> for; that's my look out.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{a little}} after that <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> {{slippers}} home from the Charity Ball at the Grand Palaver. Archie Jones <b>took</b> <b>her</b> home herself in his car, but <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> slippers. She'd forgotten them. I thought that a pretty good sign, wasn't it? You wouldn't let a chap carry round your slippers unless you knew him pretty well, would you, Miss Philippa?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> hand, <b>I</b> {{pressed it}} tenderly; I was touched, deeply touched.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Marian {{is a safe}} person, {{and will}} get no further than 'I don't know;' at least if she is the Marian <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> for," [...] said Lady Marchmont.|$|E
6000|$|... "Be {{careful what}} you say, Geoffrey. It is you who are not fit to have charge of Effie. Be careful lest <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> away from you altogether, as I can if I like." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> you'll be glad {{enough to}} join us; that is, if we will have you." [...] Then Madame Socani ground her teeth together, and turned up her nose with redoubled scorn.|$|E
60|$|My heart {{went out}} to <b>her</b> at once. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> hand in mine again.|$|R
5000|$|It {{seems that}} she's a fairyFrom Andersen's library,And <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> forThe {{proprietor}} ofA Ladies' Seminary! ...|$|R
60|$|A shining landau {{stopped before}} the entrance. The lady rose. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> hand, and bowed.|$|R
6000|$|... "The only plan, Peter, {{is to get}} {{in through}} Rhoda's window. She is very angry at that brute Jones {{treating}} us so badly, and if <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> into the secret I feel sure she will agree." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, you see, I haven't exactly popped to her yet; but I {{have been}} doing the civil; and if she's up to snuff, as <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> to be, she knows very well what I'm after by this time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never thought}} to take her away," [...] he answered. [...] "Where should <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> to? What can a lonesome old vagabond, like me, do for her? If she's happy where she is--let her stop where she is." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> to {{the palace}} gardens, famous for their beauty {{in that part of}} Germany.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> hand in mine, {{and held}} it up in the air above her head solemnly.|$|R
60|$|I kneeled beside her, and in {{my hands}} <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> little hand, that was cold as ice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Excuse me, please," [...] said Jo Cone. [...] "I am a bad fighter. My {{good wife}} conquered me years ago, for she can fight better than <b>I.</b> <b>Take</b> <b>her,</b> Your Majesty, instead of me, and I'll bless {{you for the}} favor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, {{remembering what}} Ayesha was <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> as she is, in faith and hope {{of what she}} shall be. At least love is immortal and if it must, why let it feed on memory alone till death sets free the soul." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{at least}} will be richer," [...] {{said the other}} woman, [...] "and by the crown of Baaltis. Well, I do not grudge it you, {{and as for the}} {{daughter}} of Sakon, she shall be Ithobal's if <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> to him limb by limb." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> arm {{and drew}} her away. She linked her arm in mine and leaned on me.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> hand, {{and held}} it a few moments without a word. Then she gently withdrew it.|$|R
60|$|The mob rushed after, {{shouting}} horribly. Armantine {{began to}} cry, and <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> in my arms, while Nicole held my son.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll see to that," [...] said Andrew, [...] "Now, you lie {{quiet and}} Whitney will look after you while <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> up the Firth. A doctor must {{see you as}} soon as possible. Perhaps it will help things if you can go to sleep." ...|$|E
60|$|One evening {{my mother}} {{suggested}} that, to entertain her, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> to the theatre. I didn't really like to, because I was seventeen and sensitive about {{appearing in the}} streets with a girl. I couldn't see my way to enjoying my delight in public. But we went.|$|E
6000|$|... "She isn't losing {{anything}} very real," [...] Isabel said. [...] "She's just as unaccountable as ever. She {{goes out}} {{much less than}} you imagine. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> out, and send her, all I can {{to keep her from}} getting morbid. Why don't you come oftener and help me?" ...|$|E
60|$|When Owen and Morgan {{were ready}} to quit the room, <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> by the hand, and drew her a little aside.|$|R
6000|$|She had {{a curious}} horror of {{anything}} abnormal. Once <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> to see [...] "Alice in Wonderland" [...] {{thinking that this}} would be an enchanting experience for her. Not only was it intolerably repellent to her, it was terrifying, and when the bodies of the characters suddenly lengthened, she sought refuge under the seat. All deformities, grotesqueries were to her horrible, appalling. She refused to look at the actors and at last <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> away.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> hand, poor child--and {{let that}} simple action answer for me. I was too deeply {{affected}} {{to be able}} to speak.|$|R
6000|$|As {{to reward}} {{him for an}} indulgence that she must much more have divined than overheard the visitor {{approached}} him with her sweet bravery of alarm. [...] "I go on Thursday to my sister's, where I shall find Nanda Brookenham. Can <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> any message from you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you?" [...] said Flora saucily. [...] "I'm {{glad to hear}} that, because I mean to {{keep you}} in a dying state. I will tell the story as a dead secret to Lucy, when <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> to see my poor people, and you sha'n't hear it for weeks to come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{divorced}} this woman," [...] I said to them. [...] "She is a withered tree, a {{worn out}} old hag, and now <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>her</b> {{with me to}} send her to the country of the Swazis, whence she came. Cease weeping," [...] I added to Macropha, [...] "it is my last word." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{turned to}} enter the bed-chamber. Acting headlong on the impulse of the moment, <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> {{by the hand and}} stopped her.|$|R
3000|$|Three months ago, I {{discovered}} {{that my daughter}} was chatting with somebody online… <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> computer and sold it (Sabah 2006, p. 1) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|Peter had a pause. [...] "Oh Biddy thought so. She {{has seen}} <b>her</b> since, moreover. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> the other night, and her curiosity's satisfied." ...|$|R
