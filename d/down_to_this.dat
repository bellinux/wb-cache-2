500|$|A {{focus in}} {{development}} {{was to make}} End of Ages more accessible than previous Myst games, which had often stymied uninitiated players with their puzzles. Learning from the control scheme used in another real-time Myst game (a remake of the original entitled realMyst), Cyan decided to develop multiple control methods to allow new players to quickly learn the controls, {{as well as provide}} a familiar interface for franchise veterans. Esher's experiences with the player's quest allowed a hint system to be built into the story. Miller wanted to make a significant change from previous games in the series, in that the player's actions decide the fate of the characters. When asked about the ending, Miller explained, [...] "The future of civilization is <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> point, and the choices you make determine where it goes." ...|$|E
500|$|Lady Gaga {{collaborated with}} RedOne and Space Cowboy {{in writing and}} {{producing}} [...] "So Happy I Could Die". All {{three of them were}} the main instrumentalists behind the song and recorded it at Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles. Other personnel who worked on the song includes Johny Severin for vocal editing and audio engineering, Dave Russell for audio engineering and Mike Orton for mixing the song at Sarm West Studios. An occasional drinker, the song represents Gaga's fear of what she describes as the [...] "Alcohol Monster", as evident of several lyrics in the song, such as the chorus; [...] "Happy in the club with a bottle of red wine, stars in our eyes and we're having a good time." [...] In an interview with MTV, Gaga professed that the song is about the euphoric effects of alcohol—the so-called [...] "happy place"—and explained that her fear is split between two songs. [...] "My fear of alcohol. My fear of drugs... fear of addiction. [...] But alcohol is funny because it takes you <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> very happy place and just like forgetting all your problems and for just a minute you're so happy, {{and then all of a}} sudden, [...] stomach turns and go way down... And that's my relationship with consumption and abuse." [...] Other meaning behind the song was given by a writer for Elle magazine, which described it as [...] "about masturbating while thinking about a woman". The singer also acknowledged on her Twitter account that while writing the song she was inspired by English singer Lily Allen.|$|E

Like many of those enrolled in the Palestinian gendarmerie, Tegart had served in Great Britain's repression of the Irish War of Independence, and the security proposals he introduced exceeded measures adopted <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> time elsewhere in the British Empire. 70 fortresses were erected throughout the country at strategic choke points and near Palestinian villages which, if assessed as [...] "bad", were subjected to collective punishment. [...] Accordingly, from 1938 Gilbert Mackereth, the British Consul in Damascus, corresponded with Syrian and Transjordan authorities regarding border control and security to counteract arms smuggling and [...] "terrorist" [...] infiltration and produced a report for Tegart on the activities of the Palestine Defence Committee in Damascus. Tegart recommended the construction of a frontier road with a barbed wire fence, which became known as Tegart's wall, along the borders with Lebanon and Syria to help prevent the flow of insurgents, goods and weapons. Tegart encouraged close co-operation with the Jewish Agency. It was built by the Histadrut construction company Solel Boneh. The total cost was £2million.

2500|$|In 1770 Lieutenant (later Captain) James Cook, {{in command}} of the HMS Endeavour, sailed along the east coast of Australia, {{becoming}} the first known Europeans to do so. On 19 April 1770, the crew of the Endeavour sighted the east coast of Australia and ten days later landed at a bay in what is now southern Sydney. The ship's naturalist, Sir Joseph Banks, was so impressed by the volume of flora and fauna hitherto unknown to European science, that Cook named the inlet Botany Bay. Cook charted the East coast to its northern extent and, on 22 August, at Possession Island in the Torres Strait, Cook wrote in his journal: [...] "I now once more hoisted English Coulers [...] and in the Name of His Majesty King George the Third, took possession of the whole Eastern Coast from the above Latitude 38°S <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> place by the name of New South Wales." [...] This name was already applied to the south west coast of Hudson Bay, Canada, which had been called New South Wales after his native land, by the Welshman Thomas James on 20 August 1631, during a voyage of discovery in search of a Northwest Passage into the South Sea. It was 139 years later that James Cook gave the same name, without explanation, to the east coast of New Holland. Cook and Banks then reported favourably to London on the possibility of establishing a British colony at Botany Bay.|$|E
