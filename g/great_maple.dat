Peter joined him, the two lifted the boat out, placed it on their shoulders, and carried it to the lake. There were three paddles in it.

60|$|<b>Great</b> <b>maples,</b> {{heavy with}} leaves, stood {{out against the}} soft blue of the sky, and the {{sunlight}} poured over everything, bathing the stone walls, the thatches of the farmhouses, extracting from the copses of stunted pine a pungent, reviving perfume.

There were spring flowers in the farmhouse yards, masses of lilacs whose purple she drank in eagerly; the air, which had just a tang of New England sharpness, was filled with tender sounds, the clucking of hens, snatches of the songs of birds, the rustling of maple leaves in the fitful breeze. A chipmunk ran down an elm and stood staring at her with beady, inquisitive eyes, motionless save for his quivering tail, and she put forth her hand, shyly, beseechingly, as though he held the secret of life she craved.

60|$|Mrs. Pomfret, {{knowing the}} income, after an {{exhaustive}} search decided upon Leith {{as the place}} to build her villa. It must be credited to her foresight that, when she built, she saw the future possibilities of the place. The proper people had started it. And it must be credited to her genius that she added to these possibilities of Leith by bringing to it such families as she thought worthy {{to live in the}} neighbourhood--families which incidentally increased the value of the land. Her villa had a decided French look, and was so amazingly trim and neat and generally shipshape as to be fit--for only the daintiest and most discriminating feminine occupation. The house was small, and its metamorphosis from a plain wooden farm-house had been an achievement that excited general admiration. Porches had been added, and a coat of spotless white relieved by an orange striping so original that many envied, but none dared to copy it. The striping went around the white chimneys, along the cornice, under the windows and on the railings of the porch: there were window boxes gay with geraniums and abundant awnings striped white and red, to match the flowers: a high, formal hemlock hedge hid the house from the road, through which entered a blue-stone drive that cut the close-cropped lawn and made a circle to the doorway. Under the <b>great</b> <b>maples</b> on the lawn were a tea-table, rugs, and wicker chairs, and the house itself was furnished by a variety of things of a design not to be bought in the United States of America: desks, photograph frames, writing-sets, clocks, paperknives, flower baskets, magazine racks, cigarette boxes, and dozens of other articles for the duplicates of which one might have searched Fifth Avenue in vain.|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 Bigleaf maple (Acer iaacrophyllunt) is a deciduous, persistent, {{sprouting}} {{species that}} frequently accounts {{for as much}} as 20 % of the basal area in Douglas-fir forests. Because of the lack of knowledge of the role of bigleaf maple in Douglas-fir forest ecosystems and the problems that it poses as a vigorous competitor to commercial conifer seedlings, two studies were undertaken to determine its possible effects on forest soils, and to gain insight into the seedling establishment phase of its life cycle. Soil chemical and physical properties and forest floor and litterfall weights, nutrient content and forest floor turnover rates under bigleaf maple and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga !nenziesii) were compared on five sites on the eastern margin of the Oregon Coast Range. Litterfall weight and nutrient content were <b>greater</b> under <b>maple</b> on virtually every site for every macro and micro-nutrient. Forest floor biomass and nutrient content were extremely variable, much more so than litterfall, and {{there were no significant differences}} among the two species. However, turnover rates for forest floor biomass and nutrients were significantly faster under maple for every nutrient on every site. Bulk density of mineral soil was also highly variable with significant differences on only two sites. Soil nitrogen was generally <b>greater</b> under <b>maple</b> and there was a trend towards <b>greater</b> potassium under <b>maple</b> also. Amounts of calcium, magnesium and phosphorous showed no consistent trends. Soil organic matter content under <b>maple</b> was significantly <b>greater</b> than under Douglas-fir on 4 of 5 sites. The greater soil nutrients and organic matter under maple may be attributed to the more rapid forest floor turnover in that system. The establishment phase of bigleaf maple, a ubiquitous, deciduous hardwood in western Oregon's Douglas-fir forests, was studied in a variety of stands ranging from 1 to 150 years of age to identify those stages in Douglas-fir forest succession where bigleaf maple is most likely to become successfully established from seed. Germination rates of seed protected from rodents averaged from 30 to 40 % in all environments but typically less than 2 % of the unprotected seed germinated, indicating that seed predators play an important role in regulating seedling establishment. Seedling survival was highly dependent on light arid mortality after one growing season was particularly high in stands with greater than 90 % overstory cover. At least half of the first year mortality was due to browsing by burrowing rodents and invertebrates, with dessication as the second greatest cause of mortality during the first year. On plots that were monitored over two growing seasons, overwinter mortality was the second most frequent classification. Seedling survival was not related to soil moisture content or soil moisture tension. The highest survival rates (90 %) were in clearcuts and very open stands and the lowest (0 %) were in dense, young, conifer stands. Maple establishment in clearcuts will likely only be successful if seedlings escape shading by competing shrubs arid herbs. Optimum long term survival is most likely in Douglas-fir stands over 40 years of age...|$|R
