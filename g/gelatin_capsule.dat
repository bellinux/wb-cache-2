40|$|Cryopreservation of the infective larvae (L₃) of {{nematodes}} {{is being}} used increasingly for the routine maintenance of pure strains of nematodes in the laboratory. <b>Gelatin</b> <b>capsules</b> are frequently used to administer the L₃ of nematodes to sheep, but with some nematode species this method usually does not give good results with cryopreserved larvae. The development in sheep of cryopreserved L₃ of Trichostrongylus spp. and other ovine nematodes was compared when the larvae were administered either in a suspension or in <b>gelatin</b> <b>capsules</b> {{with or without the}} use of CuS 0 ₄ to stimulate the oesophageal groove reflex. Significantly larger numbers of cryopreserved L₃ developed when dosed per os in suspension than when the L₃ were dosed in <b>gelatin</b> <b>capsules.</b> Stimulation of the oesophageal groove did not appear to affect the numbers of worms that developed from L₃ dosed in suspension. It is speculated that L₃ in suspension bypass the rumen to go directly into the abomasum, while those in <b>gelatin</b> <b>capsules</b> enter the rumen, thus closely approximating the natural infestation of grazing ruminants. In these trials, however, only cryopreserved L₃ were used. Sufficient numbers of cryopreserved L₃ of Trichostrongylus falculatus and T. colubriformis in suspension developed, so that it seems unlikely that laparotomy will be required for routine infestations in the laboratory.

50|$|A recent {{addition}} to the class of riot guns is the pepper ball gun, an example {{of which is the}} FN 303. This is essentially a paintball marker, either purpose built for riot control, or modified from a commercial paintball marker. The pepper ball guns use special pepper spray ammunition based on paintball technology, consisting of a <b>gelatin</b> <b>capsule</b> filled with the riot control agent. The guns use compressed gas and provide semiautomatic fire, and the pepperballs act just like paintballs, fracturing on impact and splattering the chemical agent on impact. These can be used for direct fire, to break the balls on the target, or indirect fire, breaking near the target and spraying the agent into the target's vicinity.|$|E

All modern soft-gel encapsulation uses variations of a process developed by R. P. Scherer in 1933. His innovation was to use a rotary die to produce the capsules, with the filling taking place by blow molding.

Follow-up visits were at day 6 (immediately after administration), day 14 (pill stop), day 22 (after withdrawal bleeding) and day 35 (midcycle). Vaginal pH was measured and swabs were taken for Gram staining and culture to assess the presence of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli. Colposcopy was performed to assess the occurrence of adverse effects on the vaginal and ectocervical mucosa. Results No severe adverse events occurred. For all women, vaginal pH and Gram stain were normal from screening until pill stop. Although immediately after withdrawal bleeding, 8 out of 18 women had an elevated pH, a disturbed microflora or lacked hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli, all women had hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli and a normal vaginal pH at midcycle, and all but two had a normal Gram stain.
