5|$|Prior to teaming with Rex King, Steve Doll {{competed in}} Pacific Northwest Wrestling with partner Scott Peterson as the Southern Rockers. The team was {{fashioned}} after The Rock 'n' Roll Express, and Doll and Peterson held the NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship together seven times. In 1989, Doll replaced Peterson with King. They won the tag team title by defeating Scotty the Body and The <b>Grappler</b> on August 26. After an inconclusive rematch on September 9, {{the title was}} vacated and another rematch was ordered; the Southern Rockers regained the belts one week later. They held the title until PNW ordered it vacated again on November 4 after a match against Brian Adams and Jeff Warner; once again, Doll and King won a rematch the following week to regain the championship. They dropped the title to Adams and The <b>Grappler</b> on December 14 but regained the belts by winning a rematch on January 27, 1990.|$|E
5|$|Upon his {{departure}} from the WWF, Adams, who continued to use the Crush gimmick, returned to PNW. He was portrayed as a dominant wrestler, winning both the Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship and the Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship. Adams received {{the first of these}} two championships during this stint in the PNW while teaming with previous rival Steve Doll and defeating The Bruise Brothers for the Tag Team Championship on July 27, 1991 in Portland, Oregon. They remained the champions until September 1, 1991 when they lost the title to The <b>Grappler</b> and Don Harris. A little more than a month later, Adams received his second Pacific Northwest Heavyweight title, on October 12, 1991, in Portland after he defeated Rip Oliver via submission to the Full Nelson hold. Adams was the champion for just over three months, losing the title to Ron Harris at a show in Portland, on January 18, 1992.|$|E
5|$|While {{the landing}} force drove off the {{defenders}} and captured the fortifications, the naval squadron entered the harbour {{and opened up}} an overwhelming fire on the outnumbered Caroline. Shot was also fired at the captured East Indiamen, various other vessels in the harbour and any small batteries or shore positions that remained in French hands. Feretier and the other French naval officers, recognising that their position was hopeless, cut the anchor cables of their ships and allowed them to drift ashore, where they abandoned ship to escape capture. The British squadron then anchored in the harbour as their crews set about refloating the grounded French ships on the beach. In addition to Caroline and the East Indiamen, Rowley's squadron successfully captured a 14-gun privateer brig named <b>Grappler</b> and five or six smaller ships. With the harbour and fortifications in British hands, Keating and Willoughby entered the town of Saint-Paul without further combat.|$|E

25|$|Submission-Seeking is a {{reference}} to the strategy of taking an opponent to the ground using a takedown or throw and then applying a submission hold, forcing the opponent to submit. While grapplers will often work to attain dominant position, some may be more comfortable fighting from other positions. If a <b>grappler</b> finds themselves unable to force a takedown, they may resort to pulling guard, whereby they physically pull their opponent into a dominant position on the ground.|$|E

25|$|Rutten found {{a measure}} of {{redemption}} after the upset loss by choking out expert <b>grappler</b> and King of Pancrase Tournament Finalist Manabu Yamada in his next fight, on January 26, 1995. Rutten {{was taken to the}} ground, but he clamped an arm triangle choke from half guard and exerted such a pressure that Yamada, refusing to tap out, was choked out and remained unconscious with his eyes wide open after the hold. Thanks to this performance against the tournament finalist, Rutten received a rematch and a title shot against tournament winner and then current King of Pancrase Ken Shamrock for the King of Pancrase title on March 10. The match was very anticipated, but it ended early when Shamrock executed a kneebar and forced Rutten to submit. According to the Dutch, the loss was due to his training partner Funaki teaching him the wrong way to escape a kneebar, which made Rutten spin in the opposite direction giving a tighter hold for Shamrock. After this failure, Rutten focused on grappling even harder and started training 2 to 3 times a day solely on submissions.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} for Outlaw Star has been favorable. Eric Luce, Ivevei Upatkoon, and Michael Poirier of EX.org all gave similarly positive reviews for the Japanese manga, Japanese anime, and English anime versions of Outlaw Star respectively. Luce was complimentary of the manga's [...] "raw" [...] yet [...] "good and distinctive" [...] artwork, detailed backgrounds, and good placement of characters among one another. However, he was annoyed {{that all the}} women have [...] "disturbing tendency to {{all have the same}} silicone stiffened chests" [...] and that characters typically wear mad grins. Upatkoon found the artwork of the anime version to be good, and he particularly enjoyed the opening sequence, but took issue with the occasionally inconsistent character designs. He also appreciated the show's dichotomy between serious and humorous subject matter, shown by the titular ship in its <b>grappler</b> mode and how it communicates with the crew. Poirier found the main protagonist Gene to be the anime's best characterization: [...] "Gene Starwind is a sly, sharp-shooting hero whose success with his gun (and with the ladies) is matched only by his propensity to get space-sick. Imagine that: the star of a space-faring series has to continually worry about vomiting onto his control panel. This sort of ironic comedy can be found throughout Outlaw Star, creating excellent segues between the fantastic action sequences and the delightful characters." [...] Poirier was intrigued by its other characters as well, and was impressed by the [...] "sharp but fluid" [...] animation style and the spaceship designs. Mania.com's David Owens appreciated the artistic style specifically for the characters, nearly all of which he incidentally found likeable. Jacob Churosh of THEM Anime Reviews additionally noted high animation quality throughout. Although he proclaimed the vehicle designs of Outlaw Star to be superb, Protoculture Addicts writer Martin Ouellette judged the animation and character designs to be [...] "less lucky" [...] and lacking in [...] "the special aura" [...] of Sunrise's acclaimed 1998 series Cowboy Bebop. Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy, authors of [...] agreeably denoted Outlaw Star as [...] "no competition for Cowboy Bebop in terms of style, content, or execution".|$|E
