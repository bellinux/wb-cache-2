2500|$|Freezing semen is a {{commonly}} used technique {{in the modern}} animal agriculture industry, which is well researched with established methods Semen is often collected using an artificial vagina, electroejaculation, gloved-hand technique, abdominal stroking, or epididymal sperm collection. Preferred collection techniques vary based on species and available tools. [...] Patience and technique are keys to successful collection of semen. There are several styles and types of artificial vaginas {{that can be used}} depending on the breed and species of the male. During this process the penis enters a tube that is the approximate pressure and temperature of the female's vagina. There is a <b>disposable</b> <b>bag</b> inside the tube that collects the semen. During this process it may be beneficial to have a teaser animal—an animal used to sexually tease but not impregnate the animal—to increase the arousal of the male. Electroejaculation is a method of semen collection in the cattle industry because it yields high quality semen. However, this process requires the animal to be trained and securely held, thus it is not ideal when working with wild or feral animals. When performing this process the electroejaculator is inserted into the rectum of the male. The electroejaculator stimulates the male causing an ejaculation, after which the semen is collected. The glove hand collection technique is used mainly in the swine industry. During this process, the boar mounts a dummy, while the handler grasps the penis of the boar between the ridges of his fingers and collects the semen. Abdominal stroking is exclusively used in the poultry industry. During the technique, one technician will hold the bird, while a second technician massages the bird's cloaca. However, feces and semen both exit the male bird's body through the cloaca, so the semen quality is often low.|$|E

A plastic food storage bag is also commonly used as a pastry bag. For small quantities and fine piping, a pastry bag can be made by rolling cooking parchment or wax paper into a cone, filling it, folding the wide end several times to close it, and then cutting the tip into whatever shape is desired. This is especially useful for small quantities of melted chocolate, since a very small hole can be cut and the bag can be discarded when it cools and becomes clogged.|$|R

50|$|In 2009, Tommy crafted The Anacostia River Clean Up and Protection Act of 2009, to {{implement}} $0.05 fee on <b>disposable</b> <b>bags.</b> This landmark legislation prompted thousands of District residents to curb use of plastic bags and instead opt for reusable, green alternatives. Seventy-five percent of DC residents reported {{a decrease in}} their use of <b>disposable</b> <b>bags</b> once the bill took effect on January 1, 2010. The legislation also established a fund to restore District water bodies, including the Anacostia River; support the distribution of reusable bags in the District; install trash traps; and provide environmental education for District students. These and other efforts, championed by Tommy, have helped position the District as a model for sustainable green living for jurisdictions nationwide.|$|R
50|$|There are {{environmental}} concerns regarding use {{and disposal of}} plastic shopping and trash bags. Efforts are being taken to control and reduce their use in some European Union countries, including Ireland and the Netherlands. In some cases the cheap bags are taxed so the customer must pay a fee where {{they may not have}} done previously. Sometimes heavy duty reusable plastic and fabric bags are sold, typically costing €0.5 to €1, and these may replace <b>disposable</b> <b>bags</b> entirely. Sometimes free replacements are offered when the bag wears out. A notable exception to this trend is the UK, where <b>disposable</b> plastic <b>bags</b> are still freely available and are dominant. This trend has spread to some cities in the United States.|$|R
50|$|A bin bag or {{bin liner}} (British English) or garbage bag, or trash bag (American English) is a <b>disposable</b> <b>bag</b> used to contain rubbish (British English), or the North American {{equivalent}} trash or garbage.

5000|$|The {{owners manual}} for the cloth bag {{equipped}} machines {{recommended that the}} cloth bag be emptied after cleaning had been finished, to avoid dirt and bacteria from setting in the fibers of the bag, and preparing the machine for the next time. The cloth bag can be laundered periodically, if necessary. Starting with the Tradition model, an internal, <b>disposable</b> paper <b>bag</b> was introduced optionally {{in addition to the}} cotton cloth bag, so that customers could decide which method they preferred. The <b>disposable</b> paper <b>bag</b> offered the convenience of storing the cleaner when finished, and not requiring that the bag be emptied every time. When the Generation 3 was introduced in 1990, the only method of dirt collection was the <b>disposable</b> paper <b>bag,</b> and was later labeled [...] "Micron Magic" [...] with the Model G4, which can trap particles larger than three microns, while the cotton cloth bag traps any remaining particles that pass through. Starting with the Ultimate G Diamond Edition, the <b>disposable</b> paper <b>bag</b> was upgraded to HEPA standards.|$|R
50|$|The {{dividing}} {{lines between}} {{the various types of}} plastics is not based on material but rather on their properties and applications. For example, polyethylene (PE) is a cheap, low friction polymer commonly used to make <b>disposable</b> <b>bags</b> for shopping and trash, and is considered a commodity plastic, whereas medium-density polyethylene (MDPE) is used for underground gas and water pipes, and another variety called ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is an engineering plastic which is used extensively as the glide rails for industrial equipment and the low-friction socket in implanted hip joints.|$|R
50|$|A bag {{may or may}} not be disposable; however, even a <b>disposable</b> <b>bag</b> {{can often}} be used many times, for {{economic}} and environmental reasons. On the other hand, there may be logistic or hygienic reasons to use a bag only once. For example, a garbage bag is often disposed of with its content. A bag for packaging a disposable product is often disposed of when it is empty. Similarly, bags used as receptacles in medical procedures, such as the colostomy bag used to collect waste from a surgically diverted biological system, are typically disposed of as medical waste. Many snack foods, such as pretzels, cookies, and potato chips, are available in disposable single-use sealed bags.|$|E
5000|$|Dyson's {{breakthrough}} in the UK market came {{more than ten years}} after the initial idea, through a TV advertising campaign in which it was emphasised that, unlike most of its rivals, the Dyson vacuum did not require the continuing purchase of replacement bags. At that time, the UK market for disposable cleaner bags was £100 million. The slogan [...] "say goodbye to the bag" [...] proved more attractive to the buying public than a previous emphasis on the suction efficiency that its technology delivers. Ironically, the previous step change in domestic vacuum cleaner design had been the introduction of the <b>disposable</b> <b>bag</b> - users being prepared to pay extra for the convenience. The Dyson Dual Cyclone became the fastest-selling vacuum cleaner ever made in the UK, and outsold those of some of the companies that rejected his idea, becoming {{one of the most popular}} brands in the UK. In early 2005, it was reported that Dyson cleaners had become the market leaders in the United States by value (though not by number of units sold).|$|E

40|$|Polysialic acid (polySia), {{consisting}} of α-(2, 8) -linked N-acetylneuraminic acid monomers plays {{a crucial role}} in many biological processes. This study presents a novel process for the production of endogenous polySia using Escherichia coli K 1 in a <b>disposable</b> <b>bag</b> reactor with wave-induced mixing. <b>Disposable</b> <b>bag</b> reactors provide easy and fast production in terms of regulatory requirements as GMP, flexibility, and can easily be adjusted to larger production capacities not only by scale up but also by parallelization. Due to the poor oxygen transfer rate compared to a stirred tank reactor, pure oxygen was added during the cultivation to avoid oxygen limitation. During the exponential growth phase the growth rate was 0. 61 h− 1. Investigation of stress-related product release from the cell surface showed {{no significant differences between the}} <b>disposable</b> <b>bag</b> reactor with wave-induced mixing and the stirred tank reactor. After batch cultivation a cell dry weight of 6. 8 g L− 1 and a polySia concentration of 245 mg L− 1 were reached. The total protein concentration in the supernatant was 132 mg L− 1. After efficient and time-saving downstream processing characterization of the final product showed a protein content of below 0. 04 mgprotein/gpolySia and a maximal chain length of ∼ 90 degree of polymerization.
