Service to the Tribune Tower also ended in the 1980s, and by the 1990s traffic along the remaining section of the spur served only one customer, the Chicago Sun-Times, with only one train per day. The newspaper moved their printing plant out of <b>downtown</b> <b>Chicago</b> in early 2001 leaving no traffic across the bridge and it has since been permanently raised in the open position.
