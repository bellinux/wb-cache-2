5|$|In 1903, Henry Fairfield Osborn named {{a second}} genus of small {{theropod}} from the Morrison Formation, Ornitholestes. This genus {{was based on}} a partial skeleton from Bone Cabin Quarry, north of Como Bluff. Ornitholestes became <b>intertwined</b> <b>with</b> Coelurus in 1920, when Charles Gilmore, in his influential study of theropod dinosaurs, concluded that the two were synonyms. This was followed in the literature for decades. The two genera were not formally compared, however, nor was there a full accounting of what actually belonged to Coelurus, until John Ostrom's study in 1980.|$|E

5|$|Osmium was {{discovered}} in 1803 by Smithson Tennant and William Hyde Wollaston in London, England. The discovery of osmium is <b>intertwined</b> <b>with</b> that of platinum and the other metals of the platinum group. Platinum reached Europe as platina ("small silver"), first encountered in the late 17th century in silver mines around the Chocó Department, in Colombia. The discovery that this metal was not an alloy, but a distinct new element, was published in 1748.|$|E
5|$|Tense {{systems in}} Mayan {{languages}} are generally simple. Jakaltek, for example, contrasts only past and non-past, while Mam has only future and non-future. Aspect systems are normally more prominent. Mood does not normally form a separate system in Mayan, but is instead <b>intertwined</b> <b>with</b> the tense/aspect system. Kaufman has reconstructed a tense/aspect/mood system for proto-Mayan that includes seven aspects: incompletive, progressive, completive/punctual, imperative, potential/future, optative, and perfective.|$|E
5|$|The Angolan Civil War was notable {{due to the}} {{combination}} of Angola's violent internal dynamics and massive foreign intervention. The war became a Cold War struggle, as both the Soviet Union and the United States, along with their respective allies, provided significant military assistance to parties in the conflict. Moreover, the Angolan conflict became closely <b>intertwined</b> <b>with</b> the Second Congo War in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo, {{as well as with}} the South African Border War.|$|E

Platinum reached Europe as platina ("silverette"), found in the 17th century by the Spanish conquerors in a region today known as the department of Chocó in Colombia. The discovery that this metal was not an alloy of known elements, but instead a distinct new element, did not occur until 1748.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} L.incarnatum are tiny, oval to roughly spherical, and measure 35–1250 by 200–450μm. The {{floating}} balls are sometimes enclosed {{in a loose}} subiculum, with a whitish surface that is byssoid (consisting of fine threads). The peridium (the outer protective tissue layer) is 18–30μm thick, byssoid, and made of clamped hyphae typically 2.5–4μm in diameter <b>intertwined</b> <b>with</b> dendrophyses (irregularly branched cystidia) 1μm in diameter. The surface of the peridium is hydrophobic, a feature that helps keep water off the growing hymenium during its development, and gives the fruit body buoyancy.|$|E
5|$|Trucks are vitally {{important}} to U.S. industry, however, measuring {{the impact of}} trucking on the economy is more difficult, because trucking services are so <b>intertwined</b> <b>with</b> all sectors of the economy. According to the measurable share of the economy that trucking represents, the industry directly contributes about 5 percent to {{the gross domestic product}} annually. In addition, the industry plays a critical support role for other transportation modes and for other sectors of the economy such as the resource, manufacturing, construction, and wholesale and retail trade industries.|$|E

Additionally, proteins such as NFIL3, which {{have been shown to}} be closely <b>intertwined</b> <b>with</b> both T-cell differentiation and our circadian rhythms, can be affected through the disturbance of natural light and dark cycles through instances of sleep deprivation, shift work, etc. As a result, these disruptions can lead to an increase in chronic conditions such as heart disease, chronic pain, and asthma.|$|E

5|$|Aerojet's {{first two}} {{contracts}} {{were from the}} U.S. Navy; the Bureau of Aeronautics requested a solid-fuel JATO and the Wilbur Wright Field requested a liquid-fuel unit. The Air Corps had requested two thousand JATOs from Aerojet by late 1943, committing $256,000 toward Parsons' solid-fuel type. Despite this drastically increased turnover, the company continued to operate informally and remained <b>intertwined</b> <b>with</b> the GALCIT project. Caltech astronomer Fritz Zwicky was brought in {{as head of the}} company's research department. Haley replaced von Kármán as Aerojet chairman and imposed payroll cuts instead of reducing JATO output; the alternative was to cut staff numbers while maintaining more generous salaries, but Haley's priority was Aerojet's contribution to the war effort. Company heads including Parsons were exempted from this austerity, drawing the ire of many personnel.|$|E

The Persian alphabet is supported by the devoutly religious, Islamists, and by those who wish to bring the country closer to Iran and their Persian heritage. As the de facto standard, the Cyrillic alphabet is generally supported by those who wish to maintain the status quo, and not distance the country from Russia.|$|E
5|$|Buried {{initially}} in {{an unmarked}} bomb crater in Salamaua, Newton's body was recovered and re-interred in Lae War Cemetery after Salamaua's capture by Allied troops in September 1943.
