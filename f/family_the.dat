40|$|The {{notion that}} <b>the</b> <b>family</b> is <b>the</b> unit {{of care for}} family doctors has been enigmatic and controversial. Yet systems theory and the biopsychosocial model that results when it is {{imported}} into medicine make <b>the</b> <b>family</b> system an indispensable and important component of <b>family</b> medicine. <b>The</b> challenge, therefore, {{is to provide a}} coherent, plausible account of the role of <b>the</b> <b>family</b> in family practice. Through an extended case presentation and commentary, we elaborate two views of <b>the</b> <b>family</b> in family medicine — treating the patient in <b>the</b> <b>family</b> and treating <b>the</b> <b>family</b> in <b>the</b> patient — and defend both as appropriate foci for care by <b>family</b> doctors. <b>The</b> practical problem that arises when <b>the</b> <b>family</b> is introduced into health care is deciding when to concentrate on <b>the</b> <b>family</b> system. <b>The</b> moral problems that arise concern how extensively doctors may become involved in the personal lives of their patients and <b>families.</b> <b>The</b> patient-centered clinical method provides a strategy for handling both problems. Thus, making <b>the</b> <b>family</b> a focus of care in family medicine can be justified on theoretical, practical, and moral grounds...|$|R
