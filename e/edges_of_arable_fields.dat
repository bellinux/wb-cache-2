40|$|The {{hypothesis}} that sown 6 m grass margins strips at the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>arable</b> <b>fields</b> {{have a positive}} impact on farmland biodiversity was tested using a paired field approach in southern England. A total of 42 fields were investigated, half with at least 3 -year-old margin strips created under the UK agri-environment scheme Countryside Stewardship and half nearby control sites. The sites were grouped on the basis of average field size into small, intermediate or open landscape locations to examine landscape structure effects. Assessments of the flora, bird and territory numbers, bees, spiders, Orthoptera and Carabidae were made in early to mid-summer 2003. There were positive impacts on diversity or abundance for the flora, bees and Orthoptera. The herbaceous flora of the pre-existing boundary adjacent to sown 6 m strips was significantly more species-rich than controls, probably reflecting a buffer effect of the strip. Bees and Orthoptera, the latter of which were only found in field boundaries, were more abundant where strips were sited, reflecting added habitat resources. Bee numbers were significantly lower in field centres where there were no 6 m margin strips. There were no significant effects of sown strips on numbers of birds observed or bird territories, spiders or Carabidae, but also no negative impacts. Lycosid spiders were consistently more abundant in boundaries of small fields with 6 m margin strips. Linyphiidae were more abundant within the crop area of smaller fields. Amongst birds, wrens (Troglodytes troglodytes) were also more abundant in small fields, while yellowhammers (Emberiza citrinella) were more abundant in open landscapes. The results confirm there are benefits to farmland biodiversity from introducing new margin strips at the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>arable</b> <b>fields.</b> More significantly, the success of agri-environment schemes, which will vary between taxa and species, can be dependent on landscape structure. Scheme administrators may need to address landscape structure and mean field size to achieve significant enhancement of populations of declining farmland species...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the changes in distribution patterns of 13 herbaceous plant species from 1998 to 2000 in ditch banks along the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>arable</b> <b>fields</b> in the Netherlands. The objective was to test if spatial dynamics {{could be related to}} spatial isolation and disturbance of habitat and to the dispersal and seed bank characteristics of the species. Knowledge of these relations should be used to increase the effectivity of agri-environmental schemes aiming at an increase of botanical diversity. All species frequently colonized empty patches and populations in occupied patches frequently went extinct. Most colonization events occurred within 50 m of conspecific source patches in the preceding year, but colonization events in patches at distances more than 200 m from conspecific source patches were also observed. The colonization probabilities decreased with isolation distance. For nine species this relation was statistically significant, after correction for year and habitat. The extinction probabilities increased with isolation. For only four species this relation was statistically significant. Both colonization and extinction probabilities were more often statistically significant related to isolation for species with transient seed banks than species with persistent seed banks.

40|$|Seven study sites {{within the}} South Wessex Downs Environmentally Sensitive Area (SWD ESA) {{were used to}} {{evaluate}} re-created downland turf, a habitat created {{under one of the}} scheme management options. The novel habitat was compared to adjacent areas of established downland and to the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>arable</b> <b>fields,</b> by collecting vegetation data, and using invertebrates as indicators of habitat quality. The recreated downland sites were re-seeded 1 to 3 years before the study. The new habitat was influenced by adjacent established downland and calcicolous species were found colonising the: edges of the re-created downland. The edges of established downland were degraded in terms of plant species richness, probably by previous arable use in adjacent fields. It was found that the re-created downland was being used by several butterfly species for breeding as well as for nectaring and that these activities were concentrated {{around the edges of the}} habitat. A second indicator group, the Homoptera, were also found on the re-created downland and, although no evidence of breeding was gathered, some of the species found on the habitat were characteristic of established downland. A third aspect of the study focused on the effect on associated herbivores of the nonnative varieties of downland species which are sown into the re-created downland. It was found that these were not as easily digested as a native variety and that although the larvae gained more weight they pupated later, thus increasing their chances of predation. This has not previously been demonstrated and it is hoped that they will help improve the management of the SWD ESA in future years...|$|E
40|$|Some {{agri-environment}} schemes {{promote the}} creation and management {{of a variety of}} non-crop habitats on farmland in the UK, yet there has been relatively little monitoring to assess how species, particularly birds, use these habitats. The present study deals with a declining UK farmland bird species, yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella, and considers to what extent grass margins <b>of</b> <b>arable</b> <b>fields</b> are used as a foraging habitat when feeding nestlings. Studies were carried out in lowland mixed farmland in southern England. Grass margins and other non-crop field boundary habitats, such as hedgerows and ditches, were selected relative to cropped areas by yellowhammers. No significant difference was found between use of cut and uncut grass margins. Studies have shown that grass margins support high densities of invertebrates and their provision at the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>arable</b> <b>fields</b> would benefit yellowhammers during the breeding season both as habitat for prey and as nesting habitat. During the breeding season from May to August, management should create cut and uncut grass margins in close proximity to each other. This could be achieved by cutting only the outer <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the grass margin, maintaining cover next to the hedgerow. Cut areas would provide easier access to food resources for birds and prevent weed encroachment to the crop, whilst adjacent uncut areas would maintain invertebrate sources and provide nesting cover for yellowhammers...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} our {{investigation}} was to clarify the effects of agriculture {{on the process of}} loss of litter at the periphery of a farmland. This study revealed the generation process of an ecologically unusual phenomenon that is observed around cropland in semi-arid regions. We hypothesized that the vegetation around a farmland cannot supply plant litter to the ground surface because the ecological structure has been changed by agricultural activities. The study was conducted at Xilingol steppe, Xilingol League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. Four study lines were established from the <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> an <b>arable</b> <b>field</b> to the surrounding meadow and parallel to the wind direction during the strong wind season. Key measurement for each line was set at the border between the farmland and steppe. Four study sites were set at intervals along each line. Plant litter, soil particle size distribution, plant species composition, plant volume, and species diversity were investigated. Despite using the same mowing method at the meadows of all study sites, the litter at the only periphery of the farmland completely disappeared. Soil particle size distribution in steppe, which was adjacent to the farmland, was {{similar to that of the}} farmland. Plant community structure at the periphery of the farmland was different from that of the far side from the farmland. This implies that soil scattered from the farmland affected the species composition of the steppe. Consequently, the change in plant community structure induced litter loss because of mowing. We concluded that plant litter was lost near the farmland because of the combined effects of farming and mowing. The results support our hypothesis that the vegetation around a farmland cannot supply plant litter because the ecological structure has been changed by agricultural activities...|$|R

40|$|Agricultural {{intensification}} has {{negative impacts}} on biodiversity at spatial scales from field to landscape. Earthworms {{are important for}} soil functioning, so {{it is crucial to}} understand the responses of earthworm communities to agricultural management and land use. We aimed to: 1) investigate whether earthworm communities differed between relatively undisturbed field margins, and highly disturbed arable fields; and 2) quantify how earthworm communities <b>of</b> <b>arable</b> <b>fields</b> and field margins are affected by three environmental filters, i. e. soil properties, management practices, and composition of the surrounding landscape. Earthworms were sampled in 26 <b>arable</b> <b>fields</b> and 15 field margins, across a polder area in The Netherlands. While earthworm density, total biomass and species richness did not differ significantly among <b>arable</b> <b>fields</b> and field margins, rarefied earthworm species richness and community composition did. The three environmental filters affected earthworm communities <b>of</b> <b>arable</b> <b>fields</b> and field margins differently. In <b>arable</b> <b>fields,</b> earthworm communities were explained by arable management only (26 %). In contrast, all three filters contributed significantly to the variation in earthworm communities of field margins, where management practices explained a larger part of the variation (18 %) than the surrounding landscape (11 %) and soil properties (10 %). Our results suggest that soil properties and surrounding landscape can affect earthworm communities of field margins. However, in the <b>arable</b> <b>fields,</b> where more diverse lumbricid communities are desirable to improve soil functions, such influences are negated by the impact of management at field scale. We demonstrated that field margins enhance earthworm biodiversity in arable landscapes, but surrounding landscape and field margins had limited impact on earthworm communities in <b>arable</b> <b>fields.</b> Decision-making and research should focus on less intensive management options for <b>arable</b> <b>fields</b> to stimulate earthworms and earthworm-mediated soil functions...|$|R

Bryophyte flora <b>of</b> <b>arable</b> <b>fields</b> has been particularly neglected and studies are of great interest since numerous species can inhabit this type of open environment.

The stations were visited twice (spring and summer) and the dynamic of these communities has been extrapolated from these data. Attempts to (i) link the species sampled in the Chablais vaudois with described phytosociological associations and (ii) explain their distribution by simple ecological factors such as plowing frequency and soil water content are discussed.

40|$|Buffer {{zones are}} vegetated strip-edges of {{agricultural}} fields along watercourses. As linear habitats in agricultural ecosystems, buffer strips dominate {{and play a}} leading ecological role in many areas. This thesis focuses on the plant species diversity of the buffer zones in a Finnish agricultural landscape. The main objective {{of the present study}} is to identify the determinants of floral species diversity in arable buffer zones from local to regional levels. This study was conducted in a watershed area of a farmland landscape of southern Finland. The study area, Lepsämänjoki, is situated in the Nurmijärvi commune 30 km to the north of Helsinki, Finland. The biotope mosaics were mapped in GIS. A total of 59 buffer zones were surveyed, of which 29 buffer strips surveyed were also sampled by plot. Firstly, two diversity components (species richness and evenness) were investigated to determine whether {{the relationship between the two}} is equal and predictable. I found no correlation between species richness and evenness. The relationship between richness and evenness is unpredictable in a small-scale human-shaped ecosystem. Ordination and correlation analyses show that richness and evenness may result from different ecological processes, and thus should be considered separately. Species richness correlated negatively with phosphorus content, and species evenness correlated negatively with the ratio of organic carbon to total nitrogen in soil. The lack of a consistent pattern in the relationship between these two components may be due to site-specific variation in resource utilization by plant species. Within-habitat configuration (width, length, and area) were investigated to determine which is more effective for predicting species richness. More species per unit area increment could be obtained from widening the buffer strip than from lengthening it. The width of the strips is an effective determinant of plant species richness. The increase in species diversity with an increase in the width of buffer strips may be due to cross-sectional habitat gradients within the linear patches. This result can serve as a reference for policy makers, and has application value in agricultural management. In the framework of metacommunity theory, I found that both mass effect(connectivity) and species sorting (resource heterogeneity) were likely to explain species composition and diversity on a local and regional scale. The local and regional processes were interactively dominated by the degree to which dispersal perturbs local communities. In the lowly and intermediately connected regions, species sorting was of primary importance to explain species diversity, while the mass effect surpassed species sorting in the highly connected region. Increasing connectivity in communities containing high habitat heterogeneity can lead to the homogenization of local communities, and consequently, to lower regional diversity, while local species richness was unrelated to the habitat connectivity. Of all species found, Anthriscus sylvestris, Phalaris arundinacea, and Phleum pretense significantly responded to connectivity, and showed high abundance in the highly connected region. We suggest that these species may play a role in switching the force from local resources to regional connectivity shaping the community structure. On the landscape context level, the different responses of local species richness and evenness to landscape context were investigated. Seven landscape structural parameters served to indicate landscape context on five scales. On all scales but the smallest scales, the Shannon-Wiener diversity of land covers (H') correlated positively with the local richness. The factor (H') showed the highest correlation coefficients in species richness on the second largest scale. The <b>edge</b> density <b>of</b> <b>arable</b> <b>field</b> was the only predictor that correlated with species evenness on all scales, which showed the highest predictive power on the second smallest scale. The different predictive power of the factors on different scales showed a scaledependent relationship between the landscape context and local plant species diversity, and indicated that different ecological processes determine species richness and evenness. The local richness of species depends on a regional process on large scales, which may relate to the regional species pool, while species evenness depends on a fine- or coarse-grained farming system, which may relate to the patch quality of the habitats <b>of</b> field <b>edges</b> near the buffer strips. My results suggested some guidelines of species diversity conservation in the agricultural ecosystem. To maintain a high level of species diversity in the strips, a high level of phosphorus in strip soil should be avoided. Widening the strips is the most effective mean to improve species richness. Habitat connectivity is not always favorable to species diversity because increasing connectivity in communities containing high habitat heterogeneity can lead to the homogenization of local communities (beta diversity) and, consequently, to lower regional diversity. Overall, a synthesis of local and regional factors emerged as the model that best explain variations in plant species diversity. The studies also suggest that the effects of determinants on species diversity have a complex relationship with scale. This study conducted on plant species diversity of field boundary habitat in agricultural landscapes. Along waterways, the vegetation boundaries, called buffer zones here, served to protect water in agricultural ecosystems. In recent decades, plant species diversity in these linear landscape structures has declined severely. Recently, emphasis has been laid on the importance of buffer zones for maintaining and enhancing the biodiversity of agricultural environments. The linear habitats have a leading ecological role on many aspects. Animal and plant species can use the linear habitats as corridors or refuges in agricultural ecosystem. The diversity of vegetation (for example, species richness, vertical structure, and species composition) in the buffer zones is important for its function to protect from agrochemicals and from eroded soil. With their year-round vegetation cover, buffer zones significantly decrease (by about 20 %) the amount of solid particles and their bound nutrients reaching waterways. Buffer zones also efficiently prevent pesticides from spreading from one field to another and into the surrounding environment, and provide habitats for animal species. In Finland, a typical field margin includes a grassy ditch bank. Maintaining plant species diversity in the linear habitats is a major aim of sustainable agricultural land-use. However, since the 1950 s, with extension and intensification of agriculture Finnish rural landscape has become simplified and the semi-natural linear habitats have been declined rapidly, particularly in southern Finland. It has resulted mainly from a shift to subsurface drainage, and associated to enlargement of parcel size and homogenization of parcel shape. This change is believed to have a subsequent adverse impact on farmland wildlife. To restore and maintain species diversity in the landscapes, This study served to understand the relationships between plant species diversity and factors from local to regional scale...|$|R

No uniform response in functional diversity across taxa or scales was found. However, in all cases where we found a relationship between increasing <b>arable</b> <b>field</b> cover and any index {{of functional}} diversity, this relationship was negative. Butterfly functional richness decreased with increasing <b>arable</b> <b>field</b> cover, as did butterfly and bird functional evenness. For butterfly functional evenness, this was only evident in the most homogeneous regions.

No effect of landscape heterogeneity on plant functional diversity was found at any spatial scale, but plant species richness decreased locally with increasing <b>arable</b> <b>field</b> cover. Overall, species richness responded more consistently to landscape homogenisation than did the functional diversity indices, with both positive and negative effects across species groups. Functional diversity indices are in theory valuable instruments for assessing effects of land use scenarios on ecosystem functioning. However, the applicability of empirical data requires deeper understanding of which traits reliably capture species' vulnerability to environmental factors and of the ecological interpretation of the functional diversity indices.

The biodiversity of the three main feeding groups – predators, soil ingesters and litter consumers – was also significantly higher in the grass strips than in the field edges without strips, indicating that establishment of grassy margins in <b>arable</b> <b>fields</b> may enhance ecosystem services such as soil fertility and pest control. The grass strip habitat contained a large number of species of soil macrofauna, being second only to hedgerow habitat, with 10 % of the total species list for the farm found only within the margins. Of the rare species recorded on the farm, five of the nine were from the grass strips, four of which were found only there. This study shows that establishing grassy strips in the margins <b>of</b> <b>arable</b> <b>fields</b> increases the biodiversity of the soil macrofauna, both within fields (alpha diversity) and across the farm (beta diversity) ...|$|R
