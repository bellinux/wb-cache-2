40|$|The {{prevalent}} {{paradigm for}} visualizing {{the universe is}} an elastic expanding medium where galaxies and photons are carried along with the medium. This leads to the early visible universe being contained within a tiny sphere, which shrinks to zero {{at the beginning of}} the universe. This paradigm uses the Robertson-Walker (RW) proper distance as a measure of distance. A different paradigm is described here which uses as a measure of distance a ruler on a rigid <b>frame</b> <b>attached</b> to the spatial origin. Differential equations are developed for describing this frame by a transform of 4 -vectors from the moving inertial <b>frames</b> <b>attached</b> to the galactic points of RW coordinates. These equations have been integrated for a universe in the matter dominated era for a universe of two different densities: critical density and zero density.
