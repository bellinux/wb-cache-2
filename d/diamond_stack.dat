5000|$|The {{railroad}} leased 223 to Salt Lake City, {{beginning at}} the 1941 Pioneer Day celebration, for five years, and donated it to the city in 1952.

A popular myth, caused by the mis-captioning of photographs, is that the 223 was moved on a special train led by four brand-new FT locomotives. According to Jerry Day, noted Rio Grande historian, it was actually sister locomotive 268 that was shipped on this special train, not the 223.

It was relocated in 1984 to the former Delaware, Lackawanna & Western Railroad's Scranton Yards at Scranton, Pennsylvania {{under the auspices of the}} Steamtown Foundation.In 1970, Steamtown began an ill-conceived attempt to cosmetically restore the engine. A replica box headlight was installed, and a wooden cab was built overtop of the existing steel cab. Most significantly, a <b>diamond</b> <b>stack</b> replica was installed on the engine. This <b>diamond</b> <b>stack</b> was much shorter than the one the engine originally carried, and was of a different design from the original.

It has been designed for the hot neutron diffractometer D 9 with the aim of improving significantly the instrument performance in particular for short wavelengths in the 0. 3 - 0. 9 Å wavelength range. Diamond crystal plates with dimensions of 1. 5 x 1. 5 x 0. 18 cm 3 and an average mosaic spread of 0. 15 ° have been synthesized at the University of Augsburg. They exhibited excellent neutron diffraction properties when examined on a neutron double-crystal test setup. Sufficiently thick diamond elements with a controlled mosaic spread of 0. 25 ° have been obtained by stacking several of these crystals.

The final performance studies on D 9 showed that the diamond device did not perform better than the original copper crystal. This unexpected result could be explained by significant optical aberrations caused by nonuniformities of both the angular and spatial mosaic distribution in the individual diamond crystals, as revealed by a detailed characterisation study using high-energy X-ray diffraction...|$|R

50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was originally}} a wood-burner with a tender that held just two cords of wood. Often the tenders wood was used before the train could reach a wood pile, forcing {{the crew to}} make use of the wooden right-of-way fences to keep the train moving. Later the locomotive was converted into a coal-burner. As built, the engine had a straight boiler (not tapered from a larger diameter at the firebox end to a smaller diameter at the smokebox end), had the balloon stack typical of wood burning engines, and three domes—the center of which was for sanding the rails to improve traction when needed. As the engine aged and parts replaced, the engines appearance changed.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the {{measurement}} of the response of 50 μm thin diamond detectors to 14 MeV neutrons. Such neutrons are produced in fusion reactors and are of particular interest for ITER neutron diagnostics. Among semiconductor detectors diamond has properties most appropriate for harsh radiation and temperature conditions of a fusion reactor. However, 300 - 500 μm thick diamond detectors suffer significant radiation damage already at neutron fluences {{of the order of}} 10 ^ 14 n/cm^ 2. It is expected that a 50 μm thick diamond will withstand a fluence of > 10 ^ 16 n/cm^ 2.

For ^ 12 C(n,α) ^ 9 Be reaction the total energy deposited in the detector gives access to the initial neutron energy value. The measured 14 MeV neutron detection sensitivity through this reaction by a detector of effective area 3 × 3 mm^ 2 was 5 × 10 ^- 7 counts cm^ 2 /n.

50|$|The {{most popular}} design was a bonnet chimney. The bonnet was a funnel-shaped sheet metal cone fitted over a {{conventional}} cylindrical chimney. The lower, small-diameter {{portion of the}} cone served as a collection hopper for falling embers. The upper portion of the cone concealed an inner cone {{at the top of}} the cylindrical chimney which deflected escaping steam, smoke and embers outward against the inner walls of the outer cone. The heavier embers were expected to fall into the hopper below while the lighter steam and smoke passed upward through a wire screen over the upper, large-diameter end of the outer cone. Deflection of the embers typically lengthened screen life to three or four weeks. Some of these chimneys had provisions dropping collected embers into a portion of the smokebox called the subtreasury. Sophisticated designs like the Radley & Hunter included various centrifugal separation baffles into the bonnet. As coal replaced wood fuel, the bonnet was reduced into a simple <b>diamond</b> <b>stack</b> housing the inner deflecting cone (with or without the upper wire screen) but without any collection hopper.|$|E

40|$|International audienceHeavy boron-doping {{layer in}} diamond can be {{responsible}} for the generation of extended defects during the growth processes (Blank et al., Diam. Relat. Mater. 17, 1840 (2008) [1]). As claimed recently (Alegre et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 105, 173103 (2014) [2]), boron pair interactions rather than strain-related misfit seems to {{be responsible for}} such dislocation generation. In the present work, electron microscopy observations are used to study the defects induced by heavy boron doping in different growth plane orientations. Facets of pyramidal Hillocks (PHs) and pits provide access to non-conventional growth orientations where boron atoms incorporation is different during growth. TEM analysis on FIB prepared lamellas confirm that also for those growth orientations, the generation of dislocations occurs within the heavily boron-doped <b>diamond</b> layers. <b>Stacking</b> faults (SFs) have been also observed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HREM). From the invisibility criteria, using weak beam (WB) observation, ½ [1 - 10] and 1 / 6 [11 - 2], Burger vectors have been identified.

Evaluating the temperature and density dependence of the chemical potential of the fluid and of the crystal phases, we find that adjusting the patch width affects the fluid and crystal in different ways. As a result of the different scaling, the driving force for spontaneous self-assembly rapidly grows as the fluid is undercooled for small-width patches, while it only grows slowly for large-width patches, in which case crystallization is pre-empted by dynamic arrest into a network glass...|$|R

40|$|One {{obstacle}} in orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT) is {{the lack}} of accurate and transferable local pseudopotentials (LPSs). In this work, we build high quality LPSs by inverting Kohn–Sham (KS) equations on bulk valence electron densities to obtain an atom-centered local pseudopotential. With this approach, we build LPSs for Mg, Al, and Si, and then test them in KS DFT calculations of static bulk properties for several Mg, Al, and Si bulk structures as well as b 00 -Al 3 Mg. Our Mg, Al, and Si LPSs produce correct ground state properties and phase orderings. These LPSs are then tested in KS-DFT calculations of surface energies for several low-index Mg and Al surfaces, point defect properties in hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) Mg, face-centered cubic (fcc) Al, and <b>diamond</b> Si, and <b>stacking</b> fault energies in fcc Al. All of these LPS results agree quantitatively with the results from nonlocal pseudopotentials with errors {{less than or equal to}} 40 meV per atom. Finally, we perform OF-DFT calculations for various Mg and Al structures, employing the Wang–Govind–Carter (WGC) nonlocal kinetic energy density functional (KEDF). The OF-DFT results generally agree well with the corresponding KS-DFT results. With our new Mg and Al LPSs and the WGC KEDF, OF-DFT now provides a practical method for accurate, large-scale first principles simulations of main group metals and their alloys. 1...|$|R
