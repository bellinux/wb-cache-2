5|$|After a duel, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>for</b> {{two male}} giraffes to caress and court each other. Such {{interactions}} between males {{have been found}} to be more frequent than heterosexual coupling. In one study, up to 94 percent of observed mounting incidents took place between males. The proportion of same-sex activities varied from 30–75 percent. Only one percent of same-sex mounting incidents occurred between females.|$|E
5|$|At {{all times}} of day, but {{particularly}} at peak hours, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>for</b> vehicles {{to have to}} queue beyond the next ferry departure.

5|$|For an implant to osseointegrate, {{it needs}} to be {{surrounded}} by a healthy quantity of bone. In order for it to survive long-term, {{it needs to}} have a thick healthy soft tissue (gingiva) envelope around it. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>for</b> either the bone or soft tissue to be so deficient that the surgeon needs to reconstruct it either before or during implant placement.|$|E

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>for</b> several troops {{within a}} {{district}} or council to gather {{at least once}} a year at a special weekend campout called a camporee. A camporee is a district- or council-wide event where several units camp and engage in activities, Scoutcraft competitions and learn specialized skills.|$|E
5|$|Systems {{also exist}} to {{classify}} TBI by its pathological features. Lesions can be extra-axial, (occurring within the skull but {{outside of the}} brain) or intra-axial (occurring within the brain tissue). Damage from TBI can be focal or diffuse, confined to specific areas or distributed in a more general manner, respectively. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>for</b> both types of injury to exist in a given case.|$|E

5|$|According to Theissen and Merz, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>for</b> {{extraordinary}} charismatic leaders, such as Jesus, to {{come into}} conflict with their ordinary families. In Mark, Jesus' family comes to get him, fearing that he is mad (Mark 3:20–34), and this account is likely historical because early Christians would not have invented it. After Jesus' death, many {{members of his family}} joined the Christian movement. Jesus' brother James became a leader of the Jerusalem Church.|$|E
5|$|Château Gaillard {{consists}} of three baileys—an inner, a middle, and an outer with the main entrance to the castle—and a keep, also called a donjon, in the inner-bailey. The baileys, which were separated by rock-cut ditches, housed the castle's stables, workshops, and storage facilities. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>for</b> extant castles {{to be the result}} of several phases of construction, and were adapted and added to over the period of their use; however Château Gaillard essentially is the result of one period of building. The division into three wards bears similarities with the design of Château de Chinon, built by HenryII in the mid-12thcentury on a promontory overlooking a town.|$|E
5|$|Diving {{medicine}} {{deals with}} medical research {{on issues of}} diving, the prevention of diving disorders, treatment of diving accident injuries and diving fitness. The field includes {{the effect on the}} human body of breathing gases and their contaminants under high pressure, and the relationship between the state of physical and psychological health of the diver and safety. In diving accidents <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>for</b> multiple disorders to occur together and interact with each other, both causatively and as complications. Diving medicine is a branch of occupational medicine and sports medicine, and first aid and recognition of symptoms of diving disorders are important parts of diver education.|$|E

5|$|Martensite {{has a lower}} density (it expands {{during the}} cooling) than does austenite, so that the {{transformation}} between them results in a change of volume. In this case, expansion occurs. Internal stresses from this expansion generally {{take the form of}} compression on the crystals of martensite and tension on the remaining ferrite, with a fair amount of shear on both constituents. If quenching is done improperly, the internal stresses can cause a part to shatter as it cools. At the very least, they cause internal work hardening and other microscopic imperfections. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>for</b> quench cracks to form when steel is water quenched, although they may not always be visible.|$|E
5|$|Most {{churches in}} the {{prosperity}} movement are non-denominational and independent, though some groups have formed networks. Prosperity churches typically reject Presbyterian polity (or governance) {{and the idea that}} a pastor should be accountable to elders; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>for</b> pastors of prosperity churches to be the highest organizational authority figure. Critics, including Sarah Posner and Joe Conason, maintain that prosperity teachers cultivate authoritarian organizations. They argue that leaders attempt to control the lives of adherents by claiming divinely bestowed authority. Jenkins contends that prosperity theology is used as a tool to justify the high salaries of pastors.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary care {{consists}} of gastric decontamination with either activated carbon or gastric lavage; {{due to the}} delay between ingestion and the first symptoms of poisoning, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>for</b> patients to arrive for treatment many hours after ingestion, potentially reducing the efficacy of these interventions. Supportive measures are directed towards treating the dehydration which results from fluid loss during the gastrointestinal phase of intoxication and correction of metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, and impaired coagulation.|$|E
50|$|Before {{no-fault divorce}} <b>was</b> available, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>common</b> <b>for</b> spouses seeking divorce to allege false grounds for divorce. Removing the {{incentive}} to perjury was one motivation for the no-fault movement.|$|R

5|$|The flocculus {{sends out}} neural signals that produce small, {{automatic}} {{movements in the}} eye muscles. These keep the image on an animal's retina steady. Pterosaurs may have had such a large flocculus because of their large wing size, which would mean {{that there was a}} great deal more sensory information to process. The low relative mass of the flocculi in birds is also a result of birds having a much larger brain overall; though this has been considered an indication that pterosaurs lived in a structurally simpler environment or had less complex behaviour compared to birds, and recent studies of crocodilians and other reptiles show that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>for</b> sauropsids to achieve high intelligence levels with small brains.|$|E
5|$|During the wet season, food is {{abundant}} and giraffes are more spread out, while {{during the dry}} season, they gather around the remaining evergreen trees and bushes. Mothers tend to feed in open areas, presumably {{to make it easier}} to detect predators, although this may reduce their feeding efficiency. As a ruminant, the giraffe first chews its food, then swallows it for processing and then visibly passes the half-digested cud up the neck and back into the mouth to chew again. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>for</b> a giraffe to salivate while feeding. The giraffe requires less food than many other herbivores because the foliage it eats has more concentrated nutrients and it has a more efficient digestive system. The animal's faeces come in the form of small pellets. When it has access to water, a giraffe drinks at intervals no longer than three days.|$|E
5|$|In 1838 William Macarthur planted Riesling vines near Penrith in New South Wales. Riesling was {{the most}} planted white grape in Australia until the early 1990s when Chardonnay greatly {{increased}} in popularity. Riesling still flourishes in The Great Southern (in particular Mt Barker, Frankland River and Porongorup), Clare Valley, in particular the areas of Watervale and around the Polish Hill River, and the cooler Eden Valley and High Eden regions. The warmer Australian climate produces thicker skinned grapes, sometimes seven times the thickness of German grown grape. The grapes ripening in free drain soil composed of red soil over limestone and shale, producing a lean wine that as it matures produces toasty, honeycomb and lime aromas and flavors. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>common</b> <b>for</b> Australian Rieslings to be fermented at low temperatures in stainless steel tanks with no oxidation of the wine and followed by earlier bottling.|$|E
50|$|In ancient Greece, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>common</b> <b>for</b> men to {{have sexual}} {{relationships}} with youths. These practices were {{a sign of}} maturity for youths, who looked up to men as sexual mentors.|$|R
50|$|Up until 1973 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>common</b> <b>for</b> {{teams to}} move between Landesligen, {{resulting}} {{in the fact that}} some teams have won titles in two different Landesligen. This practice has since stopped.|$|R
40|$|Fifty years ago, {{during an}} era when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>common</b> <b>for</b> women veterinarians and {{physicians}} to adopt their husbands’ names when marrying, some students did not change their names.
