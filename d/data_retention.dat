He also introduced a voluntary ancillary branch of the police force despite huge resistance from paid employees. McDowell's Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act, 2005 on telecommunications <b>data</b> <b>retention</b> compels service providers to store all telephone, SMS and internet records for three years and provide them to Gardaí on request.

40|$|Water {{flow through}} {{unsaturated}} rock has received increasing attention recently. In order to solve unsaturated flow problems, {{it is necessary}} to determine the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, K. A model which predicts K from water <b>retention</b> <b>data</b> was evaluated for rock matrices. It includes three unknown parameters to be determined from experimental data. To verify the model, K was measured by the outflow method. Water <b>retention</b> <b>data</b> were determined by two methods, the pressure plate extractor and the psychrometer. Near saturation, the water retention curve was best estimated by the pressure extractor method. The outflow method gave reliable measurements of K at low negative pressure heads (≥ - 1000 cm of water). The predicted K deviated from the experimental values when only the water <b>retention</b> <b>data</b> were used to estimate the model parameters. When the measured K was incorporated in the parameter estimation process, the deviation was reduced considerably...|$|R
2500|$|Dewey was {{a pioneer}} in American {{librarianship}} and an influential figure {{in the development of}} libraries in America in the late 19th and early the 20th century. He is best known for the decimal classification system that many public and school libraries use. But the decimal system was just one of a long list of innovations. Among these is the idea of the state library as controller of school and public library services within a state. [...] In Boston, Massachusetts, he founded the Library Bureau, a private company [...] "for the definite purpose of furnishing libraries with equipment and supplies of unvarying correctness and reliability." [...] It also had an investigative unit, devoted to studying the best practices of library loss-management, circulation and <b>data</b> <b>retention,</b> that recovered 3,000 books in its first year of existence.|$|E
2500|$|Google's mail servers {{automatically}} scan emails {{for multiple}} purposes, including to filter spam and malware, and to add context-sensitive advertisements next to emails. This advertising practice has been significantly criticized by privacy advocates due to concerns over unlimited <b>data</b> <b>retention,</b> ease of monitoring by third parties, users of other email providers not having {{agreed to the}} policy upon sending emails to Gmail addresses, {{and the potential for}} Google to change its policies to further decrease privacy by combining information with other Google data usage. The company {{has been the subject of}} lawsuits concerning the issues. Google has stated that email users must [...] "necessarily expect" [...] their emails to be subject to automated processing, and claims that the service refrains from displaying ads next to potentially sensitive messages, such as those mentioning race, religion, sexual orientation, health, or financial statements. In June 2017, Google announced the upcoming end to the use of contextual Gmail content for advertising purposes, relying instead on data gathered from use of its other services.|$|E
2500|$|On July 13, 2014, The Guardian {{published}} {{its first}} story {{based on an}} exclusive, seven-hour interview newly conducted with Snowden in a Moscow city centre hotel. Snowden condemned the <b>Data</b> <b>Retention</b> and Investigatory Powers Bill announced to the UK's House of Commons on July 10 bolstering the state's right to keep personal data held by Internet and phone companies. Snowden said it was very unusual for a public body to pass such emergency legislation except during total war. [...] "I mean we don't have bombs falling. We don't have U-boats in the harbor. It defies belief." [...] The Daily Mail reported that Snowden had [...] "caused fury" [...] by attacking Britain. [...] "His critics said the new surveillance Bill was being pushed through Parliament today largely because of his treachery in leaking Britain's spy secrets." [...] On July 13 and 17, The Guardian posted video clips, of about 2 minutes and 14 minutes in length, excerpted from the full interview. On July 18, The Guardian published a nearly 10,000-word edited transcript of their Snowden interview. A year after arriving in Moscow, Snowden said he is still learning Russian. He keeps late and solitary hours, effectively living on U.S. time. He does not drink, cooks for himself but doesn't eat much. [...] "I don't live in absolute secrecy," [...] he says. [...] "I live a pretty open life—but {{at the same time}} I don't want to be a celebrity." [...] He does not work for a Russian organization, yet is financially secure thanks to substantial savings from his years as a well-paid contractor and more recently numerous awards and speaking fees from around the world.|$|E
40|$|Rational {{selection}} of optimized exptl. conditions for chromatog. sepn. of analytes is realized nowadays {{by means of}} specialized computer programs. Two such programs, DryLab (LC Resources, Walnut Creek, California, USA) and ChromSword (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), were compared.

A detailed description and discussion of the differences in predicted and exptl. chromatog. retention parameters is reported. The 2 programs provide identical predictions of <b>retention</b> <b>data,</b> when predictions are based on two initial exptl. chromatog. measurements. An addnl. option of ChromSword, employing the quant. structure-retention relationships (QSRR), appears to provide satisfactory predictions of the sepn. when mol. structural <b>data</b> along with <b>retention</b> <b>data</b> from a single initial exptl. run are used as inputs.

40|$|Evaluation of {{relationships}} between molecular modeling structural parameters and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) <b>retention</b> <b>data</b> of 11 cardiovascular system drugs by principal component analysis (PCA) {{in relation to their}} pharmacological activity was performed. The six <b>retention</b> <b>data</b> parameters were determined on three different HPLC columns (Nucleosil C 18 AB with octadecylsilica stationary phase, IAM PC C 10 /C 3 with chemically bounded phosphatidylcholine, and Nucleosil 100 - 5 OH with chemically bounded propanodiole), and using isocratically acetonitrile: Britton-Robinson buffer as the mobile phase. Additionally, molecular modeling studies were performed with the use of HyperChem software and MM+ molecular mechanics with the semi-empirical AM 1 method deriving 20 structural descriptors. Factor analysis obtained with the use of various sets of parameters: structural parameters, HPLC <b>retention</b> <b>data,</b> and all 26 considered parameters, led to the extraction of two main factors. The first principal component (factor 1) accounted for 44 - 57 % {{of the variance in the}} data. The second principal component (factor 2) explained 29 - 33 % of data variance. Moreover, the total data variance explained by the first two factors was at the level of 73 - 90 %. More importantly, the PCA analysis of the HPLC <b>retention</b> <b>data</b> and structural parameters allows the segregation of circulatory system drugs according to their pharmacological (cardiovascular) properties as shown by the distribution of the individual drugs on the plane determined by the two principal components (factors 1 and 2) ...|$|R
