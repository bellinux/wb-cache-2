40|$|Risk {{efficiency}} of rice grain yield {{and returns to}} farm operators' household resources generated from an improved short-duration cover crop <b>fallow</b> system were compared with (traditional) natural bush <b>fallow,</b> and continuous rice-cropping systems. The improved <b>fallow</b> system involved maintaining "Calopogonium mucunoides", seeded into a natural bush <b>fallow</b> for 2 years before planting to rice. With no chemical fertilizer application, which reflects farmers' practice in the area, average grain yield for continuous rice (1, 185 kg/ha) and the cropping sequence incorporating a natural bush <b>fallow</b> (1, 175 kg/ha) did not differ, but were higher for the improved <b>fallow</b> system (1, 304 kg/ha). This suggests that nutrient contribution from the leguminous cover crop made up for critical crop N requirements in the improved <b>fallow.</b> Stochastic dominance of grain yield distributions from the improved <b>fallow</b> system, relative {{to the other two}} cropping systems, was more dramatic with no N fertilizer application compared to treatments with 30 kg/ha N. Average returns were highest for the improved <b>fallow</b> system, followed by the natural bush fallow-cropping system, and then continuous rice, under the no N fertilizer treatment regime. With 30 kg/ha N fertilizer, income risk efficiency was less clear (compared to treatments with no N fertilizer), especially between continuous rice and the improved <b>fallow</b> treatment, because of faster N mineralization effects on continuous rice. In contrast, the improved cover crop <b>fallow</b> system completely dominated the natural bush <b>fallow</b> treatment under both fertilizer regimes.
