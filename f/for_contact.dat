5|$|Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan {{began working}} on the film in 1979. Together, they wrote a 100+ page film {{treatment}} and set up Contact at Warner Bros. with Peter Guber and Lynda Obst as producers. When development stalled on the film, Sagan published Contact as a novel in 1985 and the film adaptation was rejuvenated in 1989. Roland Joffé and George Miller had planned to direct it, but Joffé dropped out in 1993 and Warner Bros. fired Miller in 1995. Robert Zemeckis was eventually hired to direct, and filming <b>for</b> <b>Contact</b> lasted from September 1996 to February 1997. Sony Pictures Imageworks handled most of the visual effects sequences.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1968 NUSAS {{conference in}} Johannesburg, {{many of its}} members {{attended}} a July 1968 conference of the University Christian Movement at Stutterheim. There, the black African members decided to hold a December conference to discuss {{the formation of an}} independent black student group. The South African Students' Organisation (SASO) was officially launched at a July 1969 conference at the University of the North; there, the group's constitution and basic policy platform were adopted. The group's focus was on the need <b>for</b> <b>contact</b> between centres of black student activity, including through sport, cultural activities, and debating competitions. Though Biko played a substantial role in SASO's creation, he sought a low public profile during its early stages, believing that this would strengthen its second level of leadership, such as his ally Barney Pityana. Nonetheless, he was elected as SASO's first president; Pat Matshaka was elected vice president and Wuila Mashalaba elected secretary. Durban became its de facto headquarters.|$|E

5|$|James Charles Taylor (born September 20, 1935) is {{a former}} American {{football}} fullback who played professionally in the National Football League (NFL) for ten seasons, with the Green Bay Packers from 1958 to 1966 and with the expansion New Orleans Saints in 1967. With the Packers, Taylor was invited to five straight Pro Bowls and won four NFL championships, including a victory in Super Bowl I over the Kansas City Chiefs. He was recognized as the NFL Most Valuable Player after winning the rushing title in 1962, the only season in which Jim Brown did not lead the league in rushing yards during his career. An aggressive player and fluent trash talker, Taylor developed several personal rivalries throughout his career, most notably with New York Giants linebacker Sam Huff. This confrontational attitude, combined with his tenacious running style, a penchant <b>for</b> <b>contact,</b> and ability to both withstand and deliver blows, earned him {{a reputation as one}} of the league's toughest players.|$|E
5|$|When he auditioned, Hertzberg had no {{idea what}} Adam would look like in full costume and make-up. Buffy used a company named Optic Nerve to build the {{materials}} to make Hertzberg look like a demonoid. Almost immediately after Hertzberg got the part, Optic Nerve sketched and sculpted Adam's appearance. They had Hertzberg come in to have molds made for prosthetic parts to fit his head and face, arms, chest, and legs, then he was fitted <b>for</b> <b>contact</b> lenses. They also created separate hands and a chest to film for close-up shots. Adam has a floppy disk drive mounted on his chest which, when used, had to be filmed without Hertzberg behind it. The entire construction of Adam's appearance took about two weeks. Hertzberg's voice was also modified post-production. When he saw the full Adam prosthetic and costume, his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex. It took hours to get Hertzberg into his full costume, but even after it was fully applied on set, often he would have to wait even longer before he went in front of the cameras. He spoke of the need to stay focused during all the waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for the part.|$|E

They managed to get a clearer picture of the entire MB palatial area up to the 1600s BC destruction, and recovered further wall plaster fragments. The structure underneath the MB II palace was determined most likely to be a palace itself, and further fragments of Aegean wall frescos and imported pottery were found, allowing the excavators to push back the time <b>for</b> <b>contact</b> with the Aegean and Cyprus to the MB I period.
