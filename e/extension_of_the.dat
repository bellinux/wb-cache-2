40|$|I review some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> physics {{motivations and}} {{potential}} <b>of</b> various <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> standard model that {{pertain to the}} lepton sector. These include <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lepton multiplet content, closely related to <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> neutrinos, <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electroweak breaking sector, such as supersymmetry, as well as possible <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gauge sector. They may all lead to new signatures at levels accessible to experiment. 1. Introduction. Our present standard model leaves open many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fundamental issues in particle physics, such as <b>the</b> mechanism <b>of</b> mass generation and <b>the</b> properties <b>of</b> neutrinos. <b>Extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basic picture that see...|$|R

40|$|It {{is shown}} that two {{different}} supersymmetric <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Harry Dym equation lead to two different negative hierarchies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supersymmetric integrable equations. While {{the first one}} yields the known even supersymmetric Hunter - Saxton equation, the second one is a new odd supersymmetric Hunter - Saxton equation. It is further proved that these two supersymmetric <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hunter - Saxton equation are reciprocally transformed to two different supersymmetric <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Liouville equation.

5|$|The tickets {{along the}} Northeast <b>Extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pennsylvania Turnpike were {{originally}} handed out by person. In 1987, machines started to replace humans in distributing tickets. In 1990, an {{electronic toll collection}} system was proposed for the Pennsylvania Turnpike, where a motorist would create an account and use an electronic device that would be read from an electronic tollbooth. The motorist would be billed later. The multi-state electronic tolling system, which was to be called E-ZPass, was planned to be implemented by 1998. The planned installation date was later pushed back to 2000. On December2, 2000, E-ZPass debuted along the Northeast <b>Extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pennsylvania Turnpike between Mid-County and Lehigh Valley. On December15, 2001, E-ZPass was extended to include {{the entire length of the}} Northeast <b>Extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pennsylvania Turnpike.
