40|$|This thesis was {{performed}} at Zetterbergs Industri AB. Zetterbergs is designing, building and mounts body systems for trucks, including dumpers and tippers. The assignment for the thesis was {{to design a}} <b>door</b> <b>hinge</b> <b>for</b> a spreader gate. The spreader gate is {{the top of the}} two tailgates on a dumper or tipper and opens back and outwards when tipping the cargo. The spreader gate controls the mass flow of the material being tipped. Zetterbergs want to offer their customers an opportunity to also open the spreader gate as a door and place it along the outside of the tipper to get easier access to the platform when loading equipment. They already have an existing solution for both the tipper and the dumper, but {{there is a need to}} improve and coordinate these solutions. The existing solution is not entirely rigid which causes problems of sagging when used, and a result of this is heavy lifting for the operator.   The process with designing a new hinge began with an initial study where, among others, the existing hinge and prototype solutions of the hinge at Zetterbergs were examined. To get to understand the process and which parts that needed to be taken into consideration when designing, a participation in the production was made. The initial study was finalized with the preparation of a user and technical specification.   Following the initial study several concepts was generated with a method called “ the five step method”.  Afterwards the concepts were evaluated and compared which lead to the selection of one of the concepts for a final design.   The result of this thesis is a <b>door</b> <b>hinge</b> with tree different configurations. Those three configurations were made to fit the combinations between tipper and dumper as well as aluminum and steel hatch. The hinges are similar to each other and only a few details separate them. All components in the <b>door</b> <b>hinge</b> are adjusted <b>for</b> the production at Zetterbergs. The <b>door</b> <b>hinge</b> is designed in a way that prevents the operator from using it improperly...|$|R
50|$|The 1007's {{unique design}} {{featured}} four pillars, and two power sliding doors (similar to the Toyota Porte), rather than conventional <b>hinged</b> <b>doors</b> <b>for</b> easier access in cramped spaces and on hills. The car also featured user swappable Cameleo interior trim pieces.|$|R
25|$|A selfbolting <b>door</b> {{has special}} <b>hinges</b> that permit the panel leaf to move laterally, {{so that the}} door itself becomes a giant bolt for better security. The selfbolting door {{principle}} can be used both <b>for</b> <b>hinged</b> <b>doors</b> as <b>for</b> rotating doors, as well as up-and-over doors (in the latter case, the bolts are then placed at top and bottom {{rather than at the}} sides).|$|R
50|$|Wall safes are {{designed}} to provide hidden protection for documents and miscellaneous valuables. Adjustable depth allows the maximization of usable space when installed in different wall thicknesses. Some wall safes feature pry resistant recessed <b>doors</b> with concealed <b>hinges</b> <b>for</b> anti-theft protection. A painting can be hung over a wall safe to hide it from public view.|$|R
50|$|The {{self-supporting}} {{body was}} again {{supported by a}} U-profile plywood subframe. Available body types were a 2 door 4 seater ”limousine” (saloon) and a 2 door 4 seater “cabrio-limousine” (soft top saloon/sedan). In addition to its more stylish rear end, the F4 body was also distinguished by the switch to rear <b>hinged</b> <b>doors</b> <b>for</b> easier access and egress.|$|R
40|$|A biomechanical {{analysis}} was undertaken {{to establish the}} articulation of the back lumbar region and the loads in {{the muscles of the}} back during entry and egress of a passenger vehicle with both forwarded hinged and rear <b>hinged</b> <b>doors.</b> The study was then extended to consider placing an object and retrieving an object from the rear seat of passenger vehicles with either forwarded hinged or rear <b>hinged</b> <b>doors.</b> It was found that loads in the muscles of the back and articulation angles were lower for the vehicle equipped with rear <b>hinged</b> <b>doors</b> than <b>for</b> the same activity in the same model of vehicle with forwarded <b>hinged</b> <b>door...</b>|$|R
50|$|After the war, several were {{converted}} into 6-passenger airliners. It {{was the only}} large German World War I aircraft to see commercial duties in any significant capacity. Initially, passengers sat in an open cockpit, but a Limousine version was soon developed. AEG attached a cabin fairing to enclose the passenger area and outfitted the nose with a <b>hinged</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> baggage. Finally, a toilet was provided aft of the passenger cabin.|$|R
25|$|The Elite's most {{distinctive}} feature was its highly innovative fibreglass monocoque construction, {{in which a}} stressed-skin GRP unibody replaced the previously separate chassis and body components. Unlike the contemporary Chevrolet Corvette, which used fibreglass for only exterior bodywork, the Elite used glass-reinforced plastic for the entire load-bearing structure of the car, although a steel subframe for supporting the engine and front suspension was bonded into {{the front of the}} monocoque, as was a square-section windscreen-hoop that provided mounting points <b>for</b> <b>door</b> <b>hinges,</b> jacking point <b>for</b> lifting the car and roll-over protection. The first 250 body units were made by Maximar Mouldings at Pulborough, Sussex. The body construction caused numerous early problems, until manufacture was handed over to Bristol Aeroplane Company.|$|R
50|$|A typical ryokan has a {{relatively}} large entrance hall, with couches and chairs where guests can sit and talk; a modernized ryokan often has a television in the hall as well. Guest rooms are constructed using traditional Japanese methods: flooring is tatami, and doors are sliding doors. Even if the inn uses <b>hinged</b> <b>doors</b> <b>for</b> security, it usually opens into a small entranceway where guests can take off their shoes before stepping onto the tatami floor, which would be separated by a sliding door. Many ryokan rooms also feature a porch or balcony, also set off with a sliding door.|$|R

2500|$|The 8750 Class, or 87xx class, {{were first}} built in 1933, using an updated design which {{included}} an improved cab {{with a higher}} roof, rectangular windows and grills (as opposed to the round windows, or [...] "spectacles", of the initial design), and sliding shutters and <b>hinged</b> <b>doors</b> <b>for</b> more protection from the elements. The new style cab {{was derived from the}} sister 5400 class, the first of which were built in 1931. Vacuum brakes, steam heating, and ATC were fitted as standard (except for Nos. 6750–79, built between 1946 and 1950, which were fitted with steam brakes and three link couplings only). The locomotive weight increased to , and the axle load increased to [...]|$|R
5000|$|When he was {{reunited with}} his comrades, Nale told him Sabine missed him, {{resulting}} in him [...] "bull rush tackle hugging" [...] Sabine. While Elan and Haley fought Nale and Sabine, Thog returned and, his greataxe having been left behind in Cliffport, tore the <b>door</b> off its <b>hinges</b> <b>for</b> use as an improvised weapon. Elan appealed to their newly discovered friendship and persuaded Thog that he would rather go and eat ice cream with his friends than have them fight. Thog agreed and promptly bludgeoned Haley several times with the door. Thog did not really participate in the subsequent battle between the Guild and the Order, as Elan subdued him using an illusion. He was captured after Durkon used a Hold Person spell on him at the battle's conclusion {{as he tries to}} join in the Order's group hug. The Order turned him over to the Sapphire Guard, but he later escaped with Nale and Sabine.|$|R

Practical {{part of this}} thesis deals with modifying the current low-cost side-door <b>hinge</b> <b>for</b> Edscha Automotive Kamenice s. r. o. First, material was chosen to decrease weight while maintaining the required mechanical properties. Then follows the detail design of the hinge model, which {{was created in the}} software program Catia. Heat and surface treatments are described. Both treatments ensures the hinge's final features. To verify the strength of the hinge, tensile and sag test was simulated in Ansys. Subsequently, record from the consultation of the hinge's manufacturability in series and the hinge’s cutting plans are provided. At the end of the thesis, the assembling procedure is suggested. Final part of the thesis compares the developed low-cost hinge against two similar side <b>door</b> <b>hinges...</b>|$|R
