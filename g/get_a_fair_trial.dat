5|$|Shortly {{before her}} {{scheduled}} Missouri trial date, Kinne's Missouri counsel {{filed a motion}} to change the venue of any eventual fourth trial {{in the death of}} James Kinne, claiming that news coverage of Kinne's cases had so prejudiced residents of Jackson County against her that it would be impossible for her to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial</b> there.|$|E
5|$|According to Australian court documents, on 10 January 2006, the Šibenik County Court {{ordered that}} a warrant be issued for Vasiljković's arrest. The {{offences}} listed were two alleged war crimes against prisoners of war, and one alleged war crime against the civilian population. The latter {{are related to}} {{his role in the}} attack on Glina which caused civilian deaths and injuries. He was arrested in Australia in 2006, but as an Australian national, he appealed against extradition to Croatia claiming that he would not <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial</b> there. The appeal was granted by the Federal Court in 2009, and Vasiljković was released. However, the High Court of Australia overturned the decision and Vasiljković was arrested after a 43-day search for him by the police. Subsequently, Vasiljković appealed against his extradition citing other grounds. His extradition was approved by the Minister for Home Affairs Jason Clare in November 2012, however Vasiljković appealed that decision as well. In December 2014, the Federal Court upheld Clare's decision.|$|E

50|$|In April 2017, {{the defense}} team filed a motion {{for a change of}} venue, {{requesting}} that the trial be held in Burlington, Vermont. They argued that the extensive pre-trial publicity in New York would prevent their client from <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial</b> in Manhattan. The court denied this motion the following month.|$|R
50|$|On April 10, 2017, {{the court}} ruled that the trial must be held in Milwaukee County, and that the jurors will be chosen from that county. The judge thereby denied the defense's motion for a venue change and refuted the {{argument}} that pre-trial publicity, alleged anti-police sentiment, and prior police-involved shootings might prevent the defendant from <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial.</b>|$|R
5|$|Lay and Skilling went {{on trial}} for their part in the Enron scandal in January 2006. The 53-count, 65-page {{indictment}} covers {{a broad range of}} financial crimes, including bank fraud, making false statements to banks and auditors, securities fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, conspiracy, and insider trading. United States District Judge Sim Lake had previously denied motions by the defendants to have separate trials and to relocate the case out of Houston, where the defendants argued the negative publicity concerning Enron's demise would make it impossible to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial.</b> On May 25, 2006, the jury in the Lay and Skilling trial returned its verdicts. Skilling was convicted of 19 of 28 counts of securities fraud and wire fraud and acquitted on the remaining nine, including charges of insider trading. He was sentenced to 24 years and 4 months in prison. In 2013 the United States Department of Justice reached a deal with Skilling, which resulted in ten years being cut from his sentence.|$|E
5|$|The court {{decided that}} it would be {{reasonably}} possible for a jury to convict Thomas based on the available evidence, so it then considered whether there were factors which would make a retrial unjust. Thomas' lawyer Lex Lasry argued that the delay in Thomas' prosecution (he was not arrested until seventeen months after he returned to Australia) and the extensive media coverage of the case meant it was unlikely Thomas would <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial,</b> and that a retrial would be an undue hardship on Thomas given that he has spent long periods in custody, mostly in solitary confinement, without conviction, which has led to him being diagnosed with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. The court was of the opinion that a fair trial was not impossible in these circumstances, and although the other factors were considered, the court ultimately decided that the circumstances did not preclude a retrial.|$|E
5|$|Under {{increasingly}} immense {{pressure to}} resign, Agnew took {{the position that}} a sitting vice president could not be indicted and met with Speaker of the House Carl Albert on September 25, asking for an investigation. He cited as precedent an 1826 House investigation of Vice President John C. Calhoun, who was alleged to have taken improper payments while a cabinet member. Albert, second in line to the presidency under Agnew, responded {{that it would be}} improper for the House to act in a matter before the courts. Agnew also filed a motion to block any indictment on the grounds that he had been prejudiced by improper leaks from the Justice Department, and tried to rally public opinion, giving a speech before a friendly audience in Los Angeles asserting his innocence and attacking the prosecution. Nevertheless, Agnew entered into negotiations for a plea bargain, and wrote in his memoirs that he did so because he was worn out from the extended crisis, to protect his family, and because he feared he could not <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial.</b> He made his decision on October 5, and plea negotiations took place over the following days. On October 9, Agnew visited Nixon at the White House and informed the President of his impending resignation.|$|E

50|$|On March 14, 2016 Van den Driessche {{announced}} {{she would not}} be defending herself in front of the disciplinary committee on March 15. She cited the heavy suspension demanded by the prosecution and the prohibitive cost of such a procedure in Switzerland. She said she was being denied the chance of <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial,</b> as she had already been tried and convicted {{in the court of public}} opinion. Van den Driessche also announced her immediate retirement from cycling.|$|R
50|$|Hibben's final public act was one {{of protest}} {{concerning}} the infamous Sacco-Vanzetti murder trials of the 1920s. In the summer of 1927, with Sacco and Vanzetti on death row, he joined other literary figures such as Edna St. Vincent Millay and Dorothy Parker in mass marches in Boston, charging in vain that the convicted Italian anarchists had not <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial.</b> The protesters, who had been forbidden to march, were arrested and booked repeatedly, and after the execution were fined and ordered to leave town.|$|R
25|$|Curry {{was arrested}} but was {{released}} at an inquest {{when it was}} judged that he acted in self-defense. However, a formal trial was set. Curry believed he would not <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial</b> because the judge was close friends with Landusky. For this reason, Curry left town.|$|E
25|$|The defense moved for a retrial and, {{believing the}} {{defendants}} innocent, Judge James Edwin Horton agreed {{to set aside}} the guilty verdict for Patterson. Horton ruled the rest of defendants could not <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial</b> {{at that time and}} indefinitely postponed the rest of the trials, knowing it would cost him his job when he ran for re-election.|$|E
25|$|After {{moving to}} the United States, in 1998 he was {{questioned}} by police when a seventeen-year-old boy accused him of sexual assault. He was charged, and an arrest warrant for him was issued in Howard County, Maryland on 3 April 1998, but he had already left his flat. According to his suicide note, fearing he would not <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial</b> because of his homosexuality, he fled to England where he killed himself in London in May 1998. His suicide note stated that the sex was consensual.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1980 election, Eagleton's niece Elizabeth Eagleton Weigand {{and lawyer}} Stephen Poludniak {{were arrested for}} {{blackmail}} after they threatened to spread false accusations that Eagleton was bisexual. Eagleton told reporters that the extorted money was to {{be turned over to}} the Church of Scientology. Poludniak and Weigand appealed the conviction all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, arguing that they could not have <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial</b> because of [...] "the massive publicity surrounding this case, coupled with the pre-existing sentiment in favor of Sen. Eagleton". The Court turned down the appeal.|$|R
25|$|On 11 May 1990, Magistrate Gurry ordered Einem {{to stand}} trial for the two murders of Alan Barnes and Mark Langley. Einem's defence counsel appealed the decision, {{launching}} an abuse of process action in the Supreme Court of South Australia to achieve a permanent stay of proceedings, as well as stating that the huge media interest in the charges would result in their client not <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial.</b> Proceedings began on 19 June 1990 before Justice Kevin Duggan, and six months later on 17 December 1990, Justice Duggan released his findings. He ordered Einem {{to stand trial}}, however he expressed concerns {{with most of the}} prosecution's evidence.|$|R
500|$|In 1940, {{hoping to}} {{influence}} the presidential election, Dilling published The Octopus, setting out her theories of Jewish Communism. The book was published under the pseudonym [...] "Rev. Frank Woodruff Johnson". Avedis Derounian reported Dilling claiming that [...] "The Jews can never prove that I'm anti-Semitic, I'm too clever for them." [...] Her husband feared that allegations of anti-Semitism would damage his law practice. She admitted {{that she was the}} author at her divorce trial in 1942. She explained that she wrote the book as a response to B'nai B'rith. She stated: [...] "It airs their dirty lying attempts to shut every Christian mouth and prevent anyone from <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial</b> in this country" [...] (for which she was cited for contempt).|$|R
25|$|In 1997 a government-appointed {{tribunal}} led by Judge Brian McCracken first {{revealed that}} Haughey had received substantial monetary gifts from businessmen, {{and that he}} had held secret offshore bank accounts in the Ansbacher Bank in the Cayman Islands. Haughey faced criminal charges for obstructing the work of the McCracken tribunal. His trial on these charges was postponed indefinitely after the judge in the case found {{that he would not be}} able to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial</b> following prejudicial comments by the then PD leader and Tánaiste Mary Harney.|$|E
25|$|Elected praetor peregrinus, the praetor {{in charge}} of court cases {{involving}} non-Roman citizens, for 76 BC, Marcus Lucullus presided over one cause célèbre, the trial against Gaius Antonius Hybrida (later Cicero's colleague as consul). Antonius had enriched himself shamelessly as a legate of Sulla in Greece during the First Mithridatic War. The prosecutor, the young Julius Caesar, won a conviction. Antonius managed, however, to have his conviction overturned by appealing to the people's tribunes. because, as he said, he could not <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial</b> in Rome against a Greek man.|$|E
25|$|In April 2000, two motorists {{who were}} caught {{speeding}} in the United Kingdom challenged the Road Traffic Act 1988, which required {{the keeper of}} a car to identify the driver {{at a particular time}} as being in contradiction to the Human Rights Act 1998 {{on the grounds that it}} amounted to a 'compulsory confession', also that since the camera partnerships included the police, local authorities, Magistrates Courts Service (MCS) and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) which had a financial interest in the fine revenue that they would not <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial.</b> Their plea was initially granted by a judge then overturned but was then heard by the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), and the European Court of Justice (ECJ). In 2007 the European Court of Human Rights found there was no breach of article 6 in requiring the keepers of cars caught speeding on camera to provide the name of the driver.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{damaging}} leaks, {{which appeared}} to originate from conversations between McVeigh and his defense attorneys, emerged. They included a confession {{said to have been}} inadvertently included on a computer disk that was given to the press, which McVeigh believed seriously compromised his chances of <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial.</b> <b>A</b> gag order was imposed during the trial, prohibiting attorneys on either side from commenting to the press on the evidence, proceedings, or opinions regarding the trial proceedings. The defense was allowed to enter into evidence six pages of a 517-page Justice Department report criticizing the FBI crime laboratory and David Williams, one of the agency's explosives experts, for reaching unscientific and biased conclusions. The report claimed that Williams had worked backward in the investigation rather than basing his determinations on forensic evidence.|$|R
5000|$|Registe's lawyer {{requested}} on November 20, 2008 {{that the}} judges of the Netherlands Antilles and Aruba postpone the extradition hearing {{because he had}} not had sufficient time to study the extradition documents filed by the United States’ judicial authorities to discuss them with his client. Registe's lawyer requested that his client remain in St. Maarten due to doubts about Registe's likelihood of <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial</b> in the United States:"My client has {{been the victim of}} frenzy in the United States. The media have described the alleged facts as an ‘execution-style murder’ and my client has been mentioned in one breath with serial killers and with Osama bin Laden.

500|$|The Third Circuit Court heard oral {{arguments}} in the appeals on May 17, 2007, at the United States Courthouse in Philadelphia. The appeal panel consisted of Chief Judge Anthony Joseph Scirica, Judge Thomas Ambro, and Judge Robert Cowen. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania sought to reinstate the sentence of death, {{on the basis that}} Yohn's ruling was flawed, as he should have deferred to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court which had already ruled on the issue of sentencing, and the Batson claim was invalid because Abu-Jamal made no complaints during the original jury selection. Although Abu-Jamal's jury was racially mixed, with 2 blacks and 10 whites {{at the time of his}} unanimous conviction, his counsel told the Third Circuit Court that Abu-Jamal did not <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial</b> because the jury was racially biased, misinformed, and the judge was a racist. He noted that the prosecution used eleven out of fourteen peremptory challenges to eliminate prospective black jurors. Terri Maurer-Carter, a former Philadelphia court stenographer, claimed in a 2001 affidavit nearly 20 years after the trial that she overheard Judge Sabo say [...] "Yeah, and I'm going to help them fry the nigger" [...] in the course of a conversation with three people present regarding Abu-Jamal's case. Sabo denied having made any such comment.|$|E
2500|$|McFarlane was due {{to stand}} trial on 3 October 2006.

This held up his trial until the Irish High Court ruled on the issue on 8 December 2006. However, McFarlane's representatives appealed this decision in turn. Their appeal was finally dismissed on 6 March 2008, and the trial opened in Dublin on 11 June 2008 only to collapse on 26 June when the Garda evidence was ruled inadmissible.|$|E
2500|$|Ma Anand Sheela, the {{spokesman}} for Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh at the time, stated that the jury verdict shows [...] "Rajneeshees can't <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial</b> in Oregon". Sheela characterized the lawsuit {{as part of the}} government's plan to [...] "destroy the Rajneeshees" [...] by utilizing [...] "poison" [...] of former followers, and said that the organization would appeal the verdict. Rajneesh spokeswoman Ma Prem Isabel stated: [...] "I think Oregonians basically are trying to bring their bigotry into the court, and until now they are doing pretty good. We'll see how they do on appeal. This is witchhunting if I ever saw it. I know the government is out to get this community." ...|$|E
5000|$|One {{campaign}} for which Rivett is particularly remembered was the [...] "Stuart Case". Max Stuart, an aborigine, {{was convicted of}} {{rape and murder of}} a child at Ceduna, South Australia and sentenced to death. The News had been critical of the handling of the case, arguing that Stuart was not <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial,</b> and urged the Playford government to set up a Royal Commission. The Commission on 3 December 1959 found the case against Stuart wholly justified, and seven weeks later The News and Rivett were tried on nine charges including seditious libel. The jury trial was held over ten days from 7 March 1960 with Dr. John Bray representing the accused, who were found [...] "not guilty" [...] on all but one charge. At this stage the Government dropped the case, perhaps because of the adverse publicity it was giving Playford's Liberal and Country League government. Stuart's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment and he was released on parole in 1973.|$|R
5000|$|Three stealth jurors {{allegedly}} lied {{to get on}} {{the jury}} in the Scott Peterson murder trial. Peterson's lawyers argued that “by <b>getting</b> on <b>a</b> nationally famous case jurors may have aspirations of working their jury service into a book, interviews or some other form of celebrity and possible monetary benefit." [...] The lawyers argued that Peterson would {{have a better chance of}} <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>fair</b> <b>trial</b> outside of Los Angeles, the entertainment capital of the world, since many of the jurors there might be publicity hungry. After the Martha Stewart trial, a juror who gave several media interviews after the conviction was accused by Stewart's lawyers of misconduct by lying {{to get on the}} jury. His statements to the media after the verdict proclaiming Stewart's conviction as a [...] "victory for the little guy who loses money in the markets because of these types of transactions" [...] were used by the lawyers for the defendants to argue that the verdict was tainted by this juror's alleged agenda to convict.|$|R

Investors also lost billions. However, Skilling and many of the company's executives had sold huge portions of their own Enron stock before the bankruptcy filing, making a substantial profit.

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of 3 May, he was found hanged in a deserted lock-up garage he had broken into, in Shoreditch, London, after visiting Chariots Roman Spa, a local gay sauna.

The Times and the BBC reported that an arrest warrant had been issued by Howard County District Court on 3 April, that he had been charged with second-degree sexual assault and first-degree and second-degree assaults punishable by up to 20 years in jail, and that Howard County police would have requested his extradition had they known he fled to England.

5000|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that in Black and White, a 2002 film of the case, the role of Murdoch was magnified, and the part of his editor, Rivett, was minimised.

Murdoch himself believed Stuart guilty: [...] "There's no doubt that Stuart didn't <b>get</b> <b>a</b> totally <b>fair</b> <b>trial.</b> Although it's probable that he was guilty, I thought this at the time. In those days - although less so now - I was very much against the death penalty." [...] Bruce Page, Murdoch's biographer, said the case was pivotal in his career. [...] "It was the very brief period of Rupert's radicalism, which was a very good thing for Stuart, as it got him out of the hangman's noose.
