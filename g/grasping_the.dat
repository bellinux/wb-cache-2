5|$|Unlike other diurnal primates, {{which usually}} carry their infants with them, ruffed lemur mothers will stash their young by concealing {{them in the}} canopy foliage, leaving them to rest and sit quietly for several hours while she forages and {{performs}} other activities. Mothers continue to transport their offspring by mouth, moving them {{one at a time}} by <b>grasping</b> <b>the</b> infant's belly crosswise. This form of transport usually stops around 2.5 months of age when the infants become too heavy to carry.|$|E

The pull ring and safety pin assembly are fitted so that a right-handed thrower can <b>grasp</b> <b>the</b> grenade with the fuse assembly on top and the safety lever held down by the right thumb. A left-handed thrower should <b>grasp</b> <b>the</b> grenade with the fuse assembly on the bottom and the safety lever held down by the left thumb.|$|R
5|$|Olfactory {{communication}} {{is critically important}} for strepsirrhines like the ring-tailed lemur. Males and females scent mark both vertical and horizontal surfaces at the overlaps in their home ranges using their anogenital scent glands. The ring-tailed lemur will perform a handstand to mark vertical surfaces, <b>grasping</b> <b>the</b> highest point with its feet while it applies its scent. Use of scent marking varies by age, sex and social status. Male lemurs use their antebrachial and brachial glands to demarcate territories and maintain intragroup dominance hierarchies. The thorny spur that overlays the antebrachial gland on each wrist is scraped against tree trunks to create grooves anointed with their scent. This is known as spur-marking.|$|E
5|$|The forelimbs were robustly {{built and}} {{proportionally}} long, measuring 70% {{of the length}} of the hind limbs. The radius of the forearm measured 70% {{of the length of}} the humerus (forearm bone). The hand was large, approaching the humerus in length, and possessed five fingers equipped for <b>grasping.</b> <b>The</b> second finger was the longest, followed by the third and the first finger (the thumb). The first three fingers ended in large and strong claws. The fourth and fifth fingers were strongly reduced, and possibly vestigial. The phalangeal formula, which states the number of finger bones in each finger starting from the first, was 2-3-4-3-2.|$|E
5|$|The {{processes}} of feeding and capture may be aided by special parts; Pisaster brevispinus, the short-spined pisaster from the West Coast of America, {{can use a}} set of specialized tube feet to dig itself deep into the soft substrate to extract prey (usually clams). <b>Grasping</b> <b>the</b> shellfish, the starfish slowly pries open the prey's shell by wearing out its adductor muscle, and then inserts its everted stomach into the crack to digest the soft tissues. The gap between the valves need only be {{a fraction of a}} millimetre wide for the stomach to gain entry.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between behaviors upon contact with a variety of familiar animals, attitudes toward life of animals and personality traits in college students. Subjects were 232 (86 male and 146 female) undergraduates. The main results were as follows: (1) Both in sex and in the sorts of animals, the relationship between personality traits and whether one can <b>grasp</b> <b>the</b> animals was extremely different. (2) Generally saying, male and female students who could <b>grasp</b> <b>the</b> animals were less aggressive, less inferior, less neurotic and more empathic than the students who could not <b>grasp</b> <b>the</b> animals. (3) Male students who could <b>grasp</b> <b>the</b> animals were less depressive than the male students who could not <b>grasp</b> <b>the</b> animals. (4) Stronger tendency to avoid to see animals facing to death, could be seen in male students who were more neurotic and in female students who felt more inferiority. (5) Male students who had more positive attitudes toward animal protection were more empathic and more sociable than the other male students...|$|R

5|$|Agonistic {{behaviour}} typically {{consists of}} squabbles between individuals climbing over or passing each other. This occasionally involves biting. Males that are strangers may wrestle, chase, and bite each other. In extreme situations, a male {{may try to}} displace a smaller rival from a tree. This involves the larger aggressor climbing up and attempting to corner the victim, which tries either to rush past him and climb down or {{to move to the}} end of a branch. The aggressor attacks by <b>grasping</b> <b>the</b> target by the shoulders and repeatedly biting him. Once the weaker individual is driven away, the victor bellows and marks the tree. Pregnant and lactating females are particularly aggressive and attack individuals that come too close. In general, however, koalas tend to avoid energy-wasting aggressive behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Plucking: Tea {{leaves and}} flushes, which {{includes}} a terminal bud and two young leaves, are picked from Camellia sinensis bushes typically twice a year during early {{spring and early summer}} or late spring. Autumn or winter pickings of tea flushes are much less common, though they occur when climate permits. Picking is done by hand when a higher quality tea is needed, or where labour costs are not prohibitive. Depending on the skill of the picker, hand-picking is performed by pulling the flush with a snap of the forearm, arm, or even the shoulders, with the picker <b>grasping</b> <b>the</b> tea shoot using the thumb and forefinger, with the middle finger sometimes used in combination. Tea flushes and leaves can also be picked by machine, though there will be more broken leaves and partial flushes reducing the quality of the tea. However, it has also been shown that machine plucking in correctly timed harvesting periods can produce good leaves for the production of high quality teas.|$|E
5|$|Woodpeckers, piculets and wrynecks all possess {{characteristic}} zygodactyl feet, {{consisting of}} four toes, the first (hallux) {{and the fourth}} facing backward and {{the second and third}} facing forward. This foot arrangement is good for <b>grasping</b> <b>the</b> limbs and trunks of trees. Members of this family can walk vertically up a tree trunk, which is beneficial for activities such as foraging for food or nest excavation. In addition to their strong claws and feet, woodpeckers have short, strong legs. This is typical of birds that regularly forage on trunks. Exceptions are the black-backed woodpecker and the American and Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers, which have only three toes on each foot. The tails of all woodpeckers, except the piculets and wrynecks, are stiffened, and when the bird perches on a vertical surface, the tail and feet work together to support it.|$|E

25|$|When {{looking at}} open habitats, {{chameleons}} with smaller body sizes are favored. Differences between habitats include certain traits {{found in the}} chameleons. This includes limbs, feet, tail, and head width. Open habitats commonly see longer limbs but smaller feet compared to chameleons found in closed habitats. Smaller feet in the open habitat are more accustomed to <b>grasping</b> <b>the</b> narrower branches. Natural and sexual selection in open and closed habitats have different intensities which directly affects the morphological variation found within the species.|$|E
25|$|The Sakya school {{originated}} in the 11th century. It rose to power in the 13th century. Gorampa Sonam Senge (1429-1489), an important philosopher in the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, established an understandings of Prasangika which differs from Tsongkhapa. According to Gorampa, emptiness is not just mere emptiness, the absence of inherent existence, but profound emptiness, {{the absence of the}} four extremes in phenomena. In Gorampa's approach, ultimate truth is a liberating insight, that is free from even <b>grasping</b> <b>the</b> mind.|$|E

On the other hand, while Josef K.'s surroundings stay familiar even when strange events befall him, K. finds himself in a new world whose laws and rules are unfamiliar to him.|$|E

25|$|Henry rejects materialism, which admits only {{matter as}} reality, because {{the manifestation of}} matter in the {{transcendence}} of the world always presupposes life's self-revelation, whether in order to accede to it, or {{to be able to}} see it or touch it. He equally rejects idealism, which reduces being to thought and is in principle incapable of <b>grasping</b> <b>the</b> reality of being which it reduces to an unreal image, to a simple representation. For Michel Henry, the revelation of the absolute resides in affectivity and is constituted by it.|$|E
25|$|Small trout {{caught on}} a barb-less hook can be {{released}} simply by: <b>grasping</b> <b>the</b> eyelet of the fly, and rotating the eyelet toward the bend (the U-bend). This pulls the point backwards, back through the way it entered. Push the eyelet directly toward the bend until the point {{is removed from the}} fish. Large trout can be grasped gently and forceps can be used to grip the bend and push backwards, away from the direction the hook currently points. If necessary, squirming trout can be held on their backs. This often subdues the fish and provides enough time to remove the hook.|$|E
25|$|The Chabad school, {{limited to}} its namesake dynasty, but prominent, {{was founded by}} Shneur Zalman of Liadi and was {{elaborated}} by his successors, until the late 20th century. The movement retained many of the attributes of early Hasidism, before a clear divide between Righteous and ordinary followers was cemented. Chabad Rebbes insisted their adherents acquire proficiency in the sect's lore, and not relegate most responsibility to the leaders. The sect {{emphasizes the importance of}} intellectually <b>grasping</b> <b>the</b> dynamics of the hidden divine aspect and how they affect the human psyche; the very acronym Chabad is for the three penultimate Sephirot, associated with the cerebral side of consciousness.|$|E
