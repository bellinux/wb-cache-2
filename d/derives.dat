40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{approach}} to quadratic structures in <b>derived</b> algebraic geometry. We define <b>derived</b> n-shifted quadratic complexes, over <b>derived</b> affine stacks and over general <b>derived</b> stacks, and give several examples of those. We define the associated notion of <b>derived</b> Clifford algebra, in all these contexts, and compare it with its classical version, when they both apply. Finally, we prove three main existence results for <b>derived</b> shifted quadratic forms over <b>derived</b> stacks, define a <b>derived</b> version of the Grothendieck-Witt group of a <b>derived</b> stack, and {{compare it to the}} classical one.

40|$|<b>Derived</b> equivalences for Artin algebras (and almost ν-stable <b>derived</b> equivalences for finite-dimensional algebras) are {{constructed}} from Milnor squares of algebras. Particularly, three operations of gluing vertices, unifying arrows and identifying socle elements on <b>derived</b> equivalent algebras are presented to produce new <b>derived</b> equivalences {{of the resulting}} algebras from the given ones. As a byproduct, we construct a series of <b>derived</b> equivalences, showing that <b>derived</b> equivalences may change Frobenius type of algebras in general, though both tilting procedure and almost ν-stable <b>derived</b> equivalences do preserve Frobenius type of algebras.

40|$|The {{numerical}} invariants (global) cohomological length, (global) cohomological width, and (global) cohomological {{range of}} complexes (algebras) are introduced. Cohomological range {{leads to the}} concepts of <b>derived</b> bounded algebras and strongly <b>derived</b> unbounded algebras naturally. The first and second Brauer-Thrall type theorems for the bounded <b>derived</b> category of a finite-dimensional algebra over an algebraically closed field are obtained. The first Brauer-Thrall type theorem says that <b>derived</b> bounded algebras are just <b>derived</b> finite algebras. The second Brauer-Thrall type theorem says that an algebra is either <b>derived</b> discrete or strongly <b>derived</b> unbounded, but not both. Moreover, piecewise hereditary algebras and <b>derived</b> discrete algebras are characterized as the algebras of finite global cohomological width and finite global cohomological length respectively.

We establish its link with Rickard’s theorem which characterizes <b>derived</b> equivalent algebras. We then examine invariants under <b>derived</b> equivalences. Using t-structures we compare two abelian categories having equivalent <b>derived</b> categories. Finally, we briefly sketch a generalization of the tilting setup to differential graded algebras.

40|$|In {{a recent}} paper HuXi 3, we {{introduced}} a classes of <b>derived</b> equivalences called almost ν-stable <b>derived</b> equivalences.

In this paper, we shall consider the compositions of almost ν-stable <b>derived</b> equivalences and their quasi-inverses, which is called iterated almost ν-stable <b>derived</b> equivalences. We give a sufficient and necessary condition for a <b>derived</b> equivalence to be an iterated almost ν-stable <b>derived</b> equivalence, and give an explicit construction of the stable equivalence functor induced by an iterated almost ν-stable <b>derived</b> equivalence.

40|$|We {{prove the}} representability theorem in <b>derived</b> {{analytic}} geometry. The theorem asserts that an analytic moduli functor is a <b>derived</b> analytic stack if {{and only if}} it is compatible with Postnikov towers and has a global analytic cotangent complex. Our result applies to both <b>derived</b> complex analytic geometry and <b>derived</b> non-archimedean analytic geometry (rigid analytic geometry). The representability theorem is of both philosophical and practical importance in <b>derived</b> geometry. The conditions of representability are natural expectations for a moduli functor. So the theorem confirms that the notion of <b>derived</b> analytic space is natural and sufficiently general. On the other hand, the conditions are easy to verify in practice. So the theorem enables us to enhance various classical moduli spaces with <b>derived</b> structures, thus provides plenty of down-to-earth examples of <b>derived</b> analytic spaces. For the purpose of proof, we study analytification, square-zero extensions, analytic modules and cotangent complexes in the context of <b>derived</b> analytic geometry. We will explore applications of the representability theorem in our subsequent works. In particular, we will establish the existence of <b>derived</b> Quot stacks, <b>derived</b> Hilbert stacks, and <b>derived</b> mapping stacks via the representability theorem. Comment: 96 pages.
