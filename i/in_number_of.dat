5|$|Accommodation for {{students}} is {{primarily in the}} central precinct of the university and two areas of Bristol: Clifton and Stoke Bishop. In Stoke Bishop, Wills Hall {{on the edge of}} the Clifton Downs was the first to be opened, in 1929, by the then chancellor, Winston Churchill. Its original quadrangle layout has been expanded twice, in 1962 and 1990. Churchill Hall, named for the chancellor, followed in 1956, then Badock Hall in 1964. At the time of Badock Hall's establishment, some of the buildings were called Hiatt Baker Hall, but two years later, Hiatt Baker moved to its own site and is now the largest hall in the university. The first self-catering hall in Stoke Bishop was University Hall, established in 1971 with expansion in 1992. The University's newest undergraduate residence, 33 Colston Street, was opened in the city centre in October 2011 after acquiring the property in 2009. The university established a partnership with Unite PLC in order provide accommodation due to increase <b>in</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> students accepted for entry for academic year 2012/2013. A£20 million project of expanding facilities of Hiatt Baker is to provide additional 327 places for undergraduate students in 2014. All of the main halls elect groups of students to the Junior Common Room to organise the halls social calendar for the next year. Residents of student houses, private accommodation and students living at home become members of Orbital– a society organising social events {{for students}} throughout the year.|$|E

He also led the league in total {{turnovers}} with 11 interceptions and six fumbles lost. O'Sullivan, by himself, had committed more turnovers than any other NFL team at {{the time of}} his demotion. The Denver Broncos, New York Jets and Cincinnati Bengals were tied for the second most turnovers with 16. On October 27, Singletary named Hill the starting quarterback. Hill then started the final eight games of the season. O'Sullivan completed 128 of 220 passes for 1,678 yards and eight touchdowns with 11 interceptions during the 2008 season. The 49ers won two out of the eight games that he started. O'Sullivan, despite only starting eight games, was sacked 32 times, which made him tied for eighth in the NFL with Joe Flacco <b>in</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> times sacked.|$|E

5|$|Diptera {{have one}} pair of fore wings on the {{mesothorax}} {{and a pair of}} halteres, or reduced hind wings, on the metathorax. A further adaptation for flight is the reduction <b>in</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the neural ganglia, and concentration of nerve tissue in the thorax, a feature that is most extreme in the highly derived Muscomorpha infraorder. Some species of flies are exceptional in that they are secondarily flightless. The only other order of insects bearing a single pair of true, functional wings, in addition to any form of halteres, are the Strepsiptera. In contrast to the flies, the Strepsiptera bear their halteres on the mesothorax and their flight wings on the metathorax. Each of the fly's six legs has a typical insect structure of coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia and tarsus, with the tarsus in most instances being subdivided into five tarsomeres. At the tip of the limb is a pair of claws, and between these are cushion-like structures known as pulvilli which provide adhesion.|$|E

He was named among the best Melbourne players in the side's come-from-behind victory against St Kilda in the Elimination Final. Melbourne lost to Fremantle the following week, ending their third consecutive finals series. During 2006, White effected fewer hit-outs than in 2005, although his total number of disposals, marks and goals were all significantly improved. He played all of Melbourne's matches that season, as he did for four seasons from 2004—a consistent run which saw him play more than 100consecutive matches after he missed games in 2003 due to a serious shin injury and a knee injury, until Round 12, 2008.

5|$|The Battle of Osan was {{the first}} U.S. ground action of the war.

Undisciplined U.S. troops abandoned their positions prematurely, leaving equipment and wounded for North Korean troops to capture.
