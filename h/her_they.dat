60|$|Why {{they were}} transported with joy to see <b>her.</b> When <b>they</b> could not kiss her hands or <b>her</b> feet, <b>they</b> knelt in the mire {{and kissed the}} hoof-prints of <b>her</b> horse. <b>They</b> worshiped her; {{and that is what}} these priests were trying to prove. It was nothing to them that she was not to blame for what other people did. No, if she was worshiped, it was enough; she was guilty of mortal sin.|$|R

5|$|Both ships {{survived the}} war. As {{part of the}} Treaty of Versailles, which ended the war, the ships were awarded to the victorious powers as war prizes.

60|$|It comes now. Not {{a change}} in <b>her</b> eyes; <b>they</b> still remain wide open, fixed and glassy. The first {{movement}} is a movement of <b>her</b> hands. <b>They</b> rise slowly from her side and waver {{in the air like}} the hands of a person groping in the dark. Another interval, and the movement spreads to <b>her</b> lips: <b>they</b> part and tremble. A few minutes more, and words begin to drop, one by one, from those parted lips--words spoken in a lost, vacant tone, as if she is talking in her sleep.|$|R

5|$|Croatian {{authorities}} {{suspect that}} a further 61 individuals killed at Ovčara were buried there as well.

Nevenka Nekić, the Croatian {{author of a book}} on Nicolier, claims that an additional shallow grave was excavated at Ovčara in November 1991 and that Nicolier and 60 others were buried there. According to <b>her,</b> <b>they</b> were exhumed by Croatian Serb authorities and moved to a secondary location in early 1992 because the grave was so shallow that body parts protruded through the ground surface.|$|E

When Karan understands {{that he has been}} shot, they speak amongst themselves for the last time, regarding the others, about Sue and about Daljit's love for <b>her.</b> <b>They</b> are then killed by police commandos while laughing. It is then revealed that McKinley described the third kind of people he came across as being the ones who embraced death as a friend and an equal, with a heartfelt laughter. After their death, the public reacts with outrage and expresses urge to bring Indian politics to justice, following the motives of all the boys.|$|E

It {{was the first time}} Olivier witnessed such behaviour from <b>her.</b> <b>They</b> began living together, as their respective spouses had each refused to grant either of them a divorce. Under the moral standards then enforced by the film industry, their relationship had to be kept from public view.|$|E

In 1986, the couple travelled to strife-torn areas in Nicaragua and El Salvador on a visit organised by Central American Mission Partners.|$|E
