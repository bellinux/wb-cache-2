40|$|Knowledge-assisted {{visualization}} {{has been}} a fast growing field because it directly integrates and utilizes domain knowledge to produce effective data visualization. However, most existing knowledge-assisted visualization applications focus on integrating domain knowledge that are tailored only for specific analytical tasks. This reflects not only the different understandings of what “knowledge ” is in visualization, but also the difficulties in generalizing and reapplying knowledge to new problems or domains. In this paper, we differentiate knowledge into two types, tacit and explicit, and suggest four conversion processes between them (internalization, externalization, collaboration, and combination) that could be included in knowledge-assisted visualizations.

40|$|The use of {{variable}} message signs (VMS) to provide traffic information is widespread, but success depends upon behavioural response to the sign messages.

40|$|Background: The {{decreased}} {{ability to}} carry out vertical saccades is a key symptom of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). Objective measurement devices can help to reliably detect subtle eye-movement disturbances to improve sensitivity and specificity of the clinical diagnosis. The present study aims at transferring findings from restricted stationary video-oculography to a wearable head-mounted device, which can be readily applied in clinical practice. Methods: We investigated the eye movements in 10 possible or probable PSP patients, 11 Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients and 10 age-matched healthy controls (HC) using a mobile, gaze-driven video camera setup (EyeSeeCam). Ocular movements were analyzed during a standardized fixation protocol and <b>in</b> <b>an</b> unrestricted <b>real-life</b> <b>scenario</b> while walking along a corridor. Results: The EyeSeeCam detected prominent impairment of both saccade velocity and amplitude in PSP patients, differentiating them from PD and HCs. Differences were particularly evident for saccades in the vertical plane, and stronger for saccades than for other eye movements. Differences were more pronounced during the standardized protocol than in the <b>real-life</b> <b>scenario.</b> Conclusions: Combined analysis of saccade velocity and saccade amplitude during the fixation protocol with the EyeSeeCam provides a simple, rapid (< 20 s) and reliable tool to differentiate clinically established PSP patients from PD and HCs. As such, our findings prepare the ground for using wearable eye-tracking in patients with uncertain diagnoses...|$|R
30|$|EE: The EE can {{disconnect}} the USB {{power from}} the DUT, and power it with its own regulating voltage source. This enables the EE to emulate the real behaviour of a battery depleting. The current used by the DUT can then be measured with a sample frequency of 10 kHz. Using this approach, we can easily determine the exact power consumption during an experiment. The EE has some General Purpose digital Input/Output pins connected to the DUT. This allows for real-life, real-time digital sensor/actuator emulation. We use it in our prototype system to emulate a reliable clock source for the MoCo Device. The EE is synchronized with the central management server using NTP. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>real-life</b> <b>scenario,</b> a MoCo Device would be equipped with a reliable clock on their UMTS or GPS chip.|$|E

40|$|Global {{business}} life nowadays {{is marked}} by quickly evolving forms of cooperation. These are often set in virtual space where various members from different countries are brought together in order to collaborate. This trend calls for specific abilities in communication that respond to the challenges evoked by the ever evolving and newly forming nature of international virtual project teams. In this paper, these abilities are called “agile communication skills”. The paper reports on the conceptualisation and implementation of a Virtual Learning Community (VLC) <b>in</b> <b>a</b> longitude study designed to foster so-called “agile communication skills”. Our research presents an approach where VLCs are used {{in order to create}} authentic evolving cooperations between students. For this matter internet technology seemed to prove as a key enabler.

40|$|BACKGROUND When {{suddenly}} {{immersed in}} cold water, humans typically exhibit the cold shock response, although training can attenuate hyperventilation. This study extends previous findings {{by considering the}} influence of physical activity to maintain buoyancy and subsequent swimming performance. METHODS Six inexperienced swimmers (three men and three women; mean age 22. 8) received 1 wk of cold-water head-out immersions (10 x 3 min at 15 degrees C) alongside mental skills training to improve their treading water technique and to control hyperventilation upon immersion. Six inexperienced control swimmers (four men and two women; mean age 21. 8) received immersions in temperate water (27 degrees C). Ventilation, brain blood flow velocity, and blood oxygenation were measured during <b>a</b> physiological test <b>in</b> which participants trod water for 150 s. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> subsequent simulated survival test, performance (swimming duration and distance) and perception of effort were recorded. All the tests were in 10 degrees C water with the head out. RESULTS There were significant improvements in the intervention group's ability to suppress rapid increases in respiratory frequency; 62 +/- 24 breaths x min(- 1) to 33 +/- 12. The drop in brain blood flow was smaller and more transient than that previously reported due to the hypertensive response associated with treading water. DISCUSSION Inexperienced swimmers could benefit from cold-water habituation combined with mental skills training {{in order to improve}} voluntary control over the respiratory portion of the cold shock response as part of learning to tread water.

40|$|Abstract. A large {{challenge}} in home automation is {{the construction of}} control programs to dictate behavior of the system. The design of such a control program is a technically challenging task which is commonly left for the (unaided) end-user. To address this, we present an approach to construct control programs from a high-level specification of desired system behavior using game theory. We provide a complete toolchain based on the HomePort platform and using UPPAAL TiGa for control strategy synthesis. The toolchain is implemented on a Raspberry Pi as a completely automated process from behavior specification in a simple web-app interface to control strategy synthesis and e↵ectuation.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a novel system for {{enhancing}} a target speech corrupted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> non-stationary <b>real-life</b> noise <b>scenario.</b> The proposed system consists of one spatial beamformer based on GCC-PHATestimated time-delay of arrival followed by three postfilters applied <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sequential way, namely: Wiener filter, {{minimum mean square error}} estimator (MMSE) of the log-amplitude, and a model-driven postfilter (MDP) that relies on particular speech signal statistics captured by target speaker Gaussian mixture model. The beamformer accounts for the directional interferences while the MMSE speech enhancement suppresses the stationary background noise, and MDP contributes to suppress the non-stationary sources from the binaural mixture. In our evaluation, multiple objective quality metrics are used to report the speech enhancement and separation performance, averaged on the CHiME development set. The proposed system performs better than standard state-of-the-art techniques and shows comparable performance with other systems submitted to the CHiME challenge. More precisely, it is successful in suppressing the non-stationary interfering sources at different SNR levels supported by the relatively high scores for signal-to-interference-ratio.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with particle transport <b>in</b> <b>a</b> reservoir model subject to periodic thermal forcing at the water surface. A commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code coupled with a Discrete Phase Model (DPM) is adopted to examine particle motions under various conditions. The following investigations have been carried out: Firstly, a previously reported concurrent Particle Image Thermometry and Particle Image Velocimetry (PIT/PIV) experiment has been numerically reproduced. Both qualitative and quantitative agreements are achieved between the present numerical simulation and the experiment. It {{is found in the}} parametric study that the Grashof number plays <b>an</b> important role <b>in</b> determining the onset time for the instability, the time duration of the unstable phase, and the time lag of the flow response to the switch of the thermal forcing. Secondly, the numerical model is adopted to investigate particle dispersion in the reservoir <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pseudo <b>real-life</b> <b>scenario</b> <b>in</b> which nutrient particles are injected from the sidearm of the reservoir. Both of the qualitative and quantitative studies have confirmed that natural convection has an indispensable role to play in terms of the pollutant transport <b>in</b> reservoirs. <b>A</b> case study based on an event of algal bloom with potentially severe effects on the water quality in Lake Burragorang in Sydney has been discussed. Finally, the numerical model has been extended to include particle collision and augmentation, and a preliminary study has been carried out to examine the effect of particle collision on the transport of particles in the water body. The results obtained with the inclusion of a particle collision model are compared with those obtained using a non-colliding particle model.
