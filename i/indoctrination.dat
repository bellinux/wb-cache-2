5|$|At first, {{according}} to agreement, the SPARS enlisted personnel received their <b>indoctrination</b> training {{on college campuses}} operated for such by the U.S. Navy. In March 1943, the USCG decided to establish its own training center for the <b>indoctrination</b> of enlisted recruits. The site selected was the Palm Beach Biltmore Hotel, Palm Beach, Florida. Beginning in late June, all enlisted personnel received their <b>indoctrination</b> and specialized training there. Some 70 percent of the enlisted women who received recruit training also received some specialized training. Yeoman and storekeepers represented the largest share, but many SPARS were {{given the opportunity to}} train in other fields. In January 1945, the training of enlisted personnel was transferred from Palm Beach to Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, New York.|$|E

40|$|Children {{who have}} been {{programmed}} by one parent to be alienated from the other parent are commonly seen {{in the context of}} child-custody disputes.

Many evaluators use the term parental alienation syndrome to refer to the disorder engendered in such children. However, there is significant controversy going on about the validity of parental alienation syndrome. The purpose of this article has been to describe and help to differentiate parental alienation syndrome and abuse for mental health professionals working in the field, and discuss the arguments about the validity of this syndrome...|$|R
5|$|During {{the two-year}} {{life of the}} officer <b>indoctrination</b> program, about 930 women {{completed}} the training and were commissioned as SPAR officers. In late 1944, the USCG determined that this complement was sufficient for its needs and discontinued the program. However, to replace the officers who had gone overseas, and those separated from the SPARS, the officer candidate school was later reopened for one last class. The candidates were all former enlisted personnel, who received their <b>indoctrination</b> at the USCG training station, Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, New York. The USCG strived to recruit officer candidates who already had some civilian training or work experience of the type {{that could be used}} without further training. As result, only about one third of the officers received any specialized training. However, the specialized training programs produced 203 communications officers, and 106 pay and supply officers, prior to its discontinuance in November and December 1944.|$|E

40|$|The primary person {{responsible}} for the induction of a parental alienation syndrome (PAS) in a child is the litigating parent who hopes to gain leverage {{in a court of}} law by programming in the child a campaign of denigration directed against a target parent.

They turn to the courts for help and, in most cases in my experience, have suffered even greater frustration and despair because of the court’s failure to meaningfully provide them with assistance. It is the purpose of this article to point out the judiciary’s deficiencies and even failures in this realm. It is the author’s hope that increasing recognition by the judiciary of its failures to deal effectively with PAS families will play a role in the rectification of this serious problem...|$|R

25|$|Because the Chinese rarely {{executed}} prisoners, the Chinese {{consider themselves}} to be more lenient and humane than the North Koreans. However, the Chinese were unprepared for the large influx of POWs after their entry into the war, {{and a large number}} of prisoners were crowded into temporary camps for processing. Mass starvation and diseases soon swept through those camps during the winter of 1950–51, while numerous death marches were conducted by the Chinese to move the prisoners into permanent locations. Although the situation started to improve after permanent camps were established by January 1951, death by starvation still continued until April 1951. About 43 percent of all US POWs died from November 1950 to April 1951. In comparison, only 34 percent of all US prisoners died under Japanese captivity during World War II. The Chinese have defended their actions by stating that all Chinese soldiers during this period were also suffering mass starvation and diseases {{due to the lack of}} a competent logistics system. The UN POWs, however, pointed out that a lot of the Chinese camps were located near the Sino-Korean border, and claimed that the starvation was used to force the prisoners to accept the communism <b>indoctrinations</b> programs. The starvation and the POW deaths finally stopped by the summer of 1951 after the armistice talk started.|$|R
5000|$|The {{fifth and}} last story tells about the female hero Rededjet (her name is also often read as Ruddedet) and her {{difficult}} birth of three sons.

Lepper and Liechtheim both evaluate the story as some kind of narrated moral which deals with the theme of justice and what happens to traitors. Lepper points out, that the story of Rededjet might have been inspired by the historical figure of queen Khentkaus I, who lived and maybe ruled at the end of the Fourth dynasty. Khentkaus I is demonstrably entitled as the [...] "mother of two kings" [...] and for a long time it has been thought that she may have borne Userkaf and Sahure. But new evidence shows that at least Sahure had a different mother (Queen Neferhetepes), the implication of the Westcar Papyrus that the first three kings of the fifth dynasty had been siblings, is therefore incorrect. Since in the Westcar Papyrus Rededjet was concerned with the role of a future king's mother, the parallels between the biographies of the two ladies aroused special attention. The role of the maidservant is evaluated as being a key figure for a modern phrasing of <b>indoctrinations</b> about morality and betrayal. The maidservant wants to run her mistress down and is punished by destiny. The destiny is depicted here as a crocodile which snatches the traitor.

[...] Dept. of Art and Art History. University of Missouri-Kansas City, 2013 At age 24, Song Byeok became an official state propaganda artist under the totalitarian Kim regime of North Korea. After famine, family death, torture and prison camp, Song escaped from North Korea in 2002 {{and continued to}} create art in South Korea. Song Byeok now embraces his artistic freedom by subverting the ideals and <b>indoctrinations</b> of his former upbringing. Creating parodical imagery, he pairs North Korean Juche Realism with elements of Pop, mocking the ideology and former figurehead Kim Jong Il. His satirical painting Take off Your Clothes (2010) juxtaposes the head of Kim Jong Il with the body of pop icon, Marilyn Monroe subverting the ideal image of the dictator by feminizing it. Song Byeok's hybridization of Kim Jong Il's image recalls similar parodic representations of Chairman Mao and Monroe created by the Chinese Political Pop artists of the late 1980 s. These artists confronted Mao's Socialist Realism by utilizing it in combination with Western Pop iconography, subverting its ideal. Song Byeok's work is comparable as it transforms the visual language used by the Kim regime to weaken it. These artists employed the device of the feminine masquerade to ridicule their leaders, exposing the dualistic nature of their subject by challenging the past ideal to divulge a new message. Similarly, Song Byeok creates his Kim/Monroe figure to offer the viewer an alternative, formulating an invented pop icon that alters the perception of their controlled political system. Song Byeok moreover relies on {{the tools of the}} North Korean spectacle to expose the artificiality of its propagandistic imagery and his work can be analyzed along side Guy Debor's theses Society of the Spectacle (1967). Debord's commentary of the spectacularized system endures as a critical analysis of the North Korean state and correlates with the subversive artwork Song Byeok produces. By using the language of the North Korean spectacle, Song Byeok also contradicts it, going beyond its limits to shed light on its false representations. Inventing a subversive contemporary pop icon within an alternative reality, Song Byeok challenges the spectacuarlized masquerade in North Korea and offers a unique example of the importance of artistic freedomCollege of Arts and SciencesAbstract [...] List of illustrations [...] Introduction [...] The unmasking of Juche realism and the parent leader ideal [...] The feminine masquerade of Kim Jong IL [...] Song Byeok reveals the society of the spectacle [...] Conclusion [...] Illustrations [...] Reference listmonographi...|$|R
40|$|Ever {{since the}} {{judicial}} reform in late Qing, all aspects linking to China law reforms {{were forced to}} be aligned with the national goal of abolishing the unequal treaties between China and foreign powers. Forty years' legal history, as the epochal era in shaping the modern Chinese legal system, became {{an integral part of}} history of the national movement against unequal treaties. Within the period where Ju Zheng was dominant in the sphere of law, the judiciary under party control and the nation-wide discussions on China new legal system were two successive processes of the national movement: the former was meant to create solidarity and political space needed for the anti-unequal-treaties movement, and the latter was measured to offer cultural continuity and identity consensus essential for national autonomy en course toward modernity. What's more, nationalism became the overarching ideology in legal sphere during Ju's times, and its repercussions helped foment a solid legal nationalization movement. This movement was embodied in organizations at the national level, namely the National Conference of Justices and the National Association in Jurisprudence of Republic of China. Second, the movement has two essential features: Party control over the judiciary and building of a new Chinese legal system. In this legal nationalization movement, Ju Zheng was the central figure and leader from the beginning right through the end. For more than sixteen years (1932 - 1948) Mr. Ju Zheng was the most influential figure of the national judiciary under the Nanjing Regime, making the case of his legal thoughts and practices highly illustrative of the legal history of modern China. Building on Mr. Ju's personal background and experiences, this thesis attempts to foster a better understanding of Ju Zheng and his era in terms of legal history. This thesis consists of five chapters: The first chapter introduces the scope of inquiry, the main themes of the study, the sources and the literature on this subject. Next chapter documents Ju Zheng's efforts in tackling the problems of Supreme Court inherited from his predecessors during his first three years in the key position of the judiciary. The third Chapter deals with the process of party control over the judiciary. In hindsight, this process went through two stages: first, it was a project to revolutionize the justices which ended up making most judges party members; the atmosphere of the next stage manifested in an article of Ju Zheng which called attentions to efficacious partisan <b>indoctrinations</b> and to ground nationalism as the guideline for the justices. This process of intermingling of the judiciary and the party did generate some positive results. For instance, it created a vigorous nation-wide movement to seek abolition of the unequal treaties with foreign powers, which later on undergirded the judicial pattern of deciding amnesty cases by Ju Zheng judiciary. Chapter four explores the legal nationalization movements initiated from the National Conference of Justices in the year of 1935, vividly epitomized in the following nation-wide discussions in 1930 s and 1940 s on how to create a new legal system embedded in China context. The discussions eventually converged to two distinct lines: the first line claimed that it was the long-lasting Chinese culture (zhong guo gu you) that was to become the starting-point for a new legal system; in contrast, the second line argued for "rebuilding" (chong xin jian li) a new legal system for the modern China. The last chapter offers a few concluding remarks. 江照信. Adviser: Billy So Kee-long. Source: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 70 - 06, Section: A, page: 2184.

She references psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton's work Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism as a resource throughout the book. Lifton based his research on interviews he conducted with prisoners of war who had been subjected to <b>indoctrination</b> and torture during the Korean War.

5|$|In March 1918, as the Bolshevik {{government}} {{concluded a}} separate {{peace with the}} Central Powers, the Germans occupied the Donbas and Khrushchev fled to Kalinovka. In late 1918 or early 1919 he was mobilized into the Red Army as a political commissar. The post of political commissar had recently been introduced as the Bolsheviks came to rely less on worker activists and more on military recruits; its functions included <b>indoctrination</b> of recruits in the tenets of Bolshevism, and promoting troop morale and battle readiness. Beginning as commissar to a construction platoon, Khrushchev rose to become commissar to a construction battalion and was sent from the front for a two-month political course. The young commissar came under fire many times, though many of the war stories he would tell in later life dealt more with his (and his troops') cultural awkwardness, rather than with combat. In 1921, the civil war ended, and Khrushchev was demobilized and assigned as commissar to a labor brigade in the Donbas, {{where he and his}} men lived in poor conditions.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the Waffen-SS had {{suffered}} over 43,000 casualties up to February 1942, {{particularly in the}} Battle of Moscow, and Berger had to replace them.

Through an agreement with the Royal Hungarian Army, his recruiters enlisted more than 16,500 ethnic German recruits from Hungary between March and May 1942. While this campaign was ongoing, on 20 April 1942 Berger was promoted to SS-Gruppenführer. At this point, he saw a significant difference between SS ideological leadership and the martial <b>indoctrination</b> conducted by the German Army. In September 1942, the SS-FHA complained bitterly about Berger's recruiters, stating that many of the recruits were medically unsuitable, had been coerced or duped into enlisting, or were in fact ethnic Hungarians. Late in 1942, more Volksdeutsche from the Banat and Romania were combined with the SS Cavalry Brigade to form the SS-Kavallerie-Division. On 24 November 1942, the Chief of the Gestapo, Heinrich Müller advised Himmler of a proposal he had received from Berger that a Hungarian SS division could be financed by selling emigration permits to Slovak Jews.|$|E
