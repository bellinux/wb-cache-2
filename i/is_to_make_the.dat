5|$|Rockstar Games Presents Table Tennis is a {{realistic}} simulation {{of the sport}} of table tennis. In the game, two players hit a ball {{back and forth from}} one another. The goal of the game <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> opponent fail to return the ball. Players have the ability to challenge a multiplayer partner, either offline or online, or can select to challenge the game's artificial intelligence. Players can select from a roster of eleven characters, which are unlocked as they progress through the game; each character has particular skills in different areas. The game features two modes: Tournament, which involves players participating against a variety of players in different circuits; and Exhibition, which involves players challenging individual opponents in non-ranked matches.|$|E

25|$|The {{way around}} this <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> states fuzzy. That is, {{allow them to}} change {{gradually}} from one state to the next. In order to do this {{there must be a}} dynamic relationship established between different factors.|$|E

25|$|These {{fish have}} always been sought after by some animal collectors, but {{catching}} them is difficult, because the only reasonable option <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> eels tired by continually discharging their electricity.

25|$|When {{controversial}} general {{tax measures}} are presented by local governments, {{often the only}} practical remedy available to voters <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> controversial tax measure a political issue during the election campaign, including informing voters about efforts by the local government to circumvent the constitutional two-thirds vote protection for special taxes under Propositions 13 and 218.|$|E

25|$|The goal of {{intelligence}} sharing <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> HN independent. Clearly, not every HN can afford space-based systems and other advanced, expensive technology.

Decisions on what can be shared and should be shared will involve the HN, the FID nation(s) country teams, the relevant combatant command, and the intelligence community.|$|E
25|$|At {{the first}} school that {{implemented}} the school version of environmental ISO, {{teachers and students}} made an action plan.

25|$|A flare or decoy flare is {{an aerial}} {{infrared}} countermeasure {{used by a}} plane or helicopter to counter an infrared homing ("heat-seeking") surface-to-air missile or air-to-air missile. Flares are commonly composed of a pyrotechnic composition based on magnesium or another hot-burning metal, with burning temperature equal to or hotter than engine exhaust. The aim <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> infrared-guided missile seek out the heat signature from the flare rather than the aircraft's engines.|$|E
25|$|Current insurgent groups {{proclaim}} militant jihadism {{and are not}} separatist any more. Mostly led by Salafist hardliners, {{they have}} extreme and transnational religious goals, such as an Islamic Caliphate, {{to the detriment of}} a constructive cultural or nationalistic Patani identity. Salafi jihadist groups are hostile to the cultural heritage and practices of traditional Malay Muslims, accusing them of being un-Islamic. They are not concerned about an independent separate nation. Instead their immediate aim <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> Patani region ungovernable.|$|E
25|$|Title iii, Concerning Ecclesiastical Persons, {{is divided}} into seven chapters. (cap. i) Of metropolitans.

If {{this has not been}} done, the metropolitan <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> appointment, or if it be a question of the metropolitan church itself, then the senior suffragan bishop constitutes an administrator until the Holy See can provide.|$|E

25|$|Downtown is home {{to three}} {{performing}} arts venues and a movie theatre, the most for any central business district in the Inland Empire.

Dining {{is all that is}} needed to make this into a reality, as Regal Stadium 14 opened in the spring of 2012.|$|E
25|$|In 2009 the Monuments Historiques {{division}} of the French Ministry of Culture began an 18.5 million dollar program of works at the cathedral, described as a restoration project. Part of the project involved painting the interior masonry creamy-white, with trompe l’oeil marbling and gilded detailing. The restoration architect {{in charge of this}} painting is Frédéric Didier. The goal of the project, which is due for completion in 2017, <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> cathedral look as it would have done when finished in the 13th century.|$|E
25|$|Most organisms with {{colour vision}} {{are able to}} detect {{ultraviolet}} light. This high energy light can be damaging to receptor cells. With a few exceptions (snakes, placental mammals), most organisms avoid these effects by having absorbent oil droplets around their cone cells. The alternative, developed by organisms that had lost these oil droplets {{in the course of}} evolution, <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>the</b> lens impervious to UV light – this precludes the possibility of any UV light being detected, as it does not even reach the retina.|$|E
