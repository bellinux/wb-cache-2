40|$|This paper {{presents}} an institutional critique of corporate resistance to government- imposed internal control reporting in the U. S. The analysis {{begins with the}} legislative history of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 and concludes with the Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) Act of 2002 and related SEC regulations. The legislative and regulatory history of this period documents how the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, American Bar Association, Financial Executives International, and other industry groups defeated proposals for mandatory management and auditor reports on internal control. In response to intense lobbying pressure from industry and the White House during the pre-SOX period, the SEC delegated most internal control initiatives to the private sector. The resulting industry self-regulation failed to effectively curb mana <b>gement’s</b> head- in-the-sand attitude toward internal contro l. Moreover, the absence of mandatory internal control reporting {{made it difficult for}} prosecutors to establish management’s involvement in the accounting and internal control violations at their companies. The paper concludes by considering whether the SOX-related internal control regulations entail a fundamental change in institutional values, or whether the ongoing corporate resistance to government- imposed internal control regulation will render the investor protection measures largely ineffective...|$|R

Author: Nelum Berglund In my {{quantitative}} {{study in the}} spring of 2016, entitled ”Employeeship - what is it?”, it was shown that goal orientation and following guidelines, rules, policies and safety routines at the work place are some factors that effects the employeeship. Those who felt that working com- munity and cooperation are important parts of the employeeship were relatively few. There- fore, {{the purpose of this study}} became to investigate the employeeship with particular focus on which role working community and cooperation have in this process. The main focus of my study was to investigate which meaning community and cooperation have on development of employeeship and how employeeship is experienced by employees and managers at Vårdia. The study was performed as a case study were I used an open partially participation observat- ion as a data collection method. The empirical part of the survey was directed to a total of 37 individuals, of which one was a cheif exeutive officer, six managers and 30 employees. A total of 35 people were observed. Power to act, ability to communicate, cooperativeness, self- determination and occupational responsibility are the key factors in employeeship. The will to communicate is highly dependent upon the ability to communicate and the mana- <b>gements</b> power to act. When the ability to communicate is lacking, the willingness to cooperate and to take responsbility beyond what is their duty due to their proffession also vanishes according to the participants. The will to cooperate was increased when the indi- viduals could communicate in a constructive manner. How the cooperation restricts or enables the employeeship is entirely dependent on which ability the organisation has to create effici- ent forms for cooperation, common goals and the indivuduals ability to broaden or change their view of their roles as employees in the organisation. Key words: Employeeship, Employee, Organization, Community, Cooperation. ...|$|R
