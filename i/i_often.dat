Of course, I said as little as possible about it, for even partial lameness would spoil my chances on the stage. I doubt if the management ever knew; the public certainly didn't; and those who saw me dancing and capering light-heartedly about the stage for twenty years little thought under what difficulties I did it, and the pain <b>I</b> <b>often</b> suffered.|$|E

Our aircraft are basic elements, Stahlschmidt, which have got to be mastered. You've got to be able to shoot from any position. From left or right turns, out of a roll, on your back, whenever. Only this way can you develop your own particular tactics. Attack tactics, that the enemy simply cannot anticipate during the course of the battle – a series of unpredictable movements and actions, never the same, always stemming from the situation at hand. Only then can you plunge into the middle of an enemy swarm and blow it up from the inside.|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} Princeton in 1971, Berg decided {{to expand the}} thesis into a {{full-length}} biography, thinking it would take around nine months. He also formulated a career plan at this time, and later recalled: [...] "I did tell myself early on: I {{think it would be}} interesting, perhaps, to spend a career writing a half-dozen biographies of twentieth-century American cultural figures—each one, as <b>I</b> <b>often</b> use as my metaphor, a different wedge of the great apple pie." [...] The Perkins biography, Max Perkins: Editor of Genius, took longer than Berg anticipated and was eventually published in 1978, winning a National Book Award in Biography. In 2016, The New Yorker credited Berg with [...] "almost single-handedly rescu Maxwell Perkins from the anonymity he desired." ...|$|E

500|$|Years later, Barnes {{wrote about}} the effect this had on his batting style. There was one angle about this change of batting {{position}} that didn't appeal to me. I am, by nature, a forcing batsman. I like to take the shine out of a bowler [...] and I love to hear the ball rattling the pickets, or soaring over the fence... My footwork was quick and <b>I</b> <b>often</b> caused delight by stepping back feet outside the leg stump and square-cutting...

500|$|Bacon did {{not seek}} to {{illustrate}} the narrative of the tale, however. He told the French art critic Michel Leiris, [...] "I could not paint Agamemnon, Clytemnestra or Cassandra, as {{that would have been}} merely another kind of historical painting... Therefore I tried to create an image of the effect it produced inside me." [...] Aeschylus' phrase [...] "the reek of human blood smiles out at me" [...] in particular haunted Bacon, and his treatments of the mouth in the triptych and many subsequent paintings were attempts to visualise the sentiment. In 1985, he observed that Aeschylus' phrase brought up in him [...] "the most exciting images, and <b>I</b> <b>often</b> read it... the violence of it brings up the images in me, 'the reek of human blood smiles out at me', well what could be more amazing than that." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of her self-titled debut album, Carey desired to pen her {{personal}} struggles prior to her signing with Columbia.

[...] Later in the song, Carey sings [...] "But still I had to keep on going / I struggled and I prayed / And finally found my way," [...] retelling how her faith helped guide her until her career blossomed and expressing to listeners the importance of finding and connecting with God.

500|$|The first {{instalment}} of Tintin in the Land of the Soviets {{appeared in the}} 10 January 1929 edition of , and ran weekly until 8 May 1930. Hergé did not plot out the storyline in advance; he improvised new situations on a weekly basis, leaving Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier to observe that both [...] "Story-wise and graphically, Hergé was learning his craft before our eyes." [...] Hergé admitted that the work was rushed, saying, [...] "The [...] came out on Wednesday evening, and <b>I</b> <b>often</b> didn't have a clue on Wednesday morning how I {{was going to get}} Tintin out of the predicament I had put him in the previous week." [...] Michael Farr considered this evident, remarking that many drawings were [...] "crude, rudimentary, [...] rushed", lacking the [...] "polish and refinement" [...] that Hergé would later develop. Contrastingly, he thought that certain plates were of the [...] "highest quality" [...] and exhibited Hergé's [...] "outstanding ability as a draughtsman".|$|E
500|$|Plath's fellow confessional {{poet and}} friend Anne Sexton commented: [...] "Sylvia and I would talk {{at length about}} our first suicide, in detail and in depth—between the free potato chips. Suicide is, after all, the {{opposite}} of the poem. Sylvia and <b>I</b> <b>often</b> talked opposites. We talked death with burned-up intensity, both of us drawn to it like moths to an electric lightbulb, sucking on it. She told the story of her first suicide in sweet and loving detail, and her description in The Bell Jar is just that same story." [...] The confessional interpretation of Plath's work has led to some dismissing certain aspects of her work as an exposition of sentimentalist melodrama; in 2010, for example, Theodore Dalrymple asserted that Plath had been the [...] "patron saint of self-dramatization" [...] and of self-pity. Revisionist critics such as Tracy Brain have, however, argued against a tightly autobiographical interpretation of Plath's material.|$|E

He further noted, [...] "There were so many striking visual images both on stage and on screen, the show felt like a Pinterest board come to life -- packed with bold colors and graphics, elegant modern dance positions and video clips." [...] Tris McCall of The Star-Ledger also compared the light-up platforms on the stage with the towering cubes used during the Watch the Throne Tour. In another review, he noted, [...] "The light show was as hypnotic as Laser Floyd, the costumes glittered like mirror balls, and the bass at Ovation Hall was so booming that <b>I</b> <b>often</b> felt like I was standing in a stiff wind."

Wirkola said he was contacted by producer Kevin Messick from Gary Sanchez Productions after the screening of Dead Snow at the Sundance Film Festival: [...] "So my first meeting, my first day in LA was with those guys and I pitched Hansel and Gretel and they loved it. And they took me to Paramount two days after and we sold it." [...] In 2013, Wirkola commented, [...] "I’m still surprised that they went for it, because it’s a crazy, rock n’ roll script. It’s full throttle, there’s lots of blood and gore and bad language, <b>I</b> <b>often</b> wonder how I got this movie made. It’s all across the world now.

500|$|As the {{controversy}} unfolded, the Wikipedia community began {{a review of}} Essjay's previous edits and some felt he had relied upon his fictional professorship to influence editorial consideration of edits he made. [...] "People have gone through his edits and found places where he was basically cashing in on his fake credentials to bolster his arguments", said Michael Snow, a Wikipedia administrator {{and founder of the}} Wikipedia community newspaper, the Signpost. [...] "Those will get looked at again." [...] For instance, Essjay had recommended sources such as Catholicism for Dummies, a book granted the nihil obstat and imprimatur by the Roman Catholic Church. Essjay defended his use of the book by telling fellow Wikipedia editors in a disagreement over the editing of the article Imprimatur: [...] "This is a text <b>I</b> <b>often</b> require for my students, and I would hang my own Ph.D. on it's [...] credibility."

[...] The strip's visual style was similar to that of Land of the Soviets. In the first instalment of Tintin in the Congo, Hergé featured Quick and Flupke, two young boys from Brussels whom he had recently introduced in another Le Petit Vingtième comic strip, in the crowd of people saying goodbye to Tintin.|$|E
