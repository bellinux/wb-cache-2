5|$|In {{the board}} (and card) game domain, 4X {{is less of}} a {{distinct}} genre, {{in part because of the}} practical constraints of components and playing time. The Civilization board game that gave rise to Sid Meier's Civilization computer game, for instance, has no exploration and no <b>extermination.</b> Unless <b>extermination</b> is targeted at non-player entities, it tends to be either nearly impossible (because of play balance mechanisms, since player elimination is usually considered an undesirable feature) or certainly unachievable (because victory conditions are triggered before <b>extermination</b> can be completed) in board games.|$|E
5|$|Between 1941 and 1945, {{approximately}} three million Ukrainian and other gentiles were killed {{as part of}} Nazi <b>extermination</b> policies in present-day Ukraine. More Ukrainians were killed fighting the Wehrmacht in the Red Army than American, British and French soldiers combined. Original Nazi plans called for the <b>extermination</b> of 65 percent of the nation's 23.2million Ukrainians, with the survivors treated as slaves. Over two million Ukrainians were deported to Germany as slave labor. The ten-year plan would have exterminated, expelled, Germanized or enslaved most (or all) Ukrainians.|$|E

5|$|When Italy {{surrendered}} to the Allies in September 1943, all concentration camps in Albania were dissolved. Shortly after, the Germans invaded and occupied Albania, and most Italian soldiers in the country {{surrendered to}} the Germans. German forces then began to target for <b>extermination</b> all Jews living in Albania and the Albanian-dominated regions of occupied Yugoslavia. The Jewish community in western Macedonia, which had remained untouched under Italian occupation, was targeted and several groups of Jews were dispatched to <b>extermination</b> camps. Their property and belongings were later taken by many organizations, institutions and private individuals.|$|E
5|$|After Germany {{occupied}} Hungary in March 1944, the genocidal {{policies of}} the authorities were applied comprehensively. Hungarian Jews were subjected to starvation and death marches, and those that had remained {{in the occupied territories}} were transported to <b>extermination</b> camps. From 26 April 1944, the remaining Jews in Bačka and Baranja, mostly women, but including children and the elderly, were rounded up into local concentration camps then moved to larger camps in Hungary proper. Between 14,000 and 15,000 Jews from Bačka, Baranja and other parts of Hungary were collected at Baja and Bácsalmás then transported to Auschwitz where most were killed. In September 1944, the workforce of the Bor mine was force-marched for several weeks back to <b>extermination</b> camps where the survivors were killed. One of the two groups of workers numbered 2,500, but only a few survived.|$|E

A collective punishment typically associated with offenses such as treason, the punishment involved the execution of all relatives of an individual, which were categorized into nine groups. The occurrence of this punishment was somewhat rare, with relatively few sentences recorded throughout history. There were also variants of the punishment found in ancient Korea and Vietnam (the most prominent example being the family of Nguyễn Trãi).|$|R
5|$|After the {{invasion}} of Poland {{at the start of}} World War II, Kraków became the capital of Germany's General Government.

40|$|Abstract. ― The case Perinçek v. Switzerland {{concerned}} the criminal conviction of a Turkish politician for publicly affirming the view, in Switzerland, that <b>exterminations</b> {{suffered by the}} Armenians had not amounted to genocide. On 15 October 2015, the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights delivered its judgement and concluded {{that it had not}} been necessary, in a context of a democratic society, to subject Mr Perinçek to a criminal conviction {{in order to protect the}} rights of the Armenian Community. Therefore, the Grand Chamber held, by a majority, that there had been a violation of Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The judgment leads to a differentiation in the approach to <b>exterminations</b> which is open to some criticism...|$|R

5|$|On Hitler's behalf, Himmler {{formed the}} Einsatzgruppen and built <b>extermination</b> camps.

5|$|Prior to {{the near}} <b>extermination</b> of wolves and cougars, the coyote was most {{numerous}} in grasslands inhabited by bison, pronghorn, elk, and other deer, doing particularly well in short-grass areas with prairie dogs, {{though it was}} just as much at home in semiarid areas with sagebrush and jackrabbits or in deserts inhabited by cactus, kangaroo rats, and rattlesnakes. As long as it was not in direct competition with the wolf, the coyote ranged from the Sonoran Desert to the alpine regions of adjoining mountains or the plains and mountainous areas of Alberta. With the <b>extermination</b> of the wolf, the coyote's range expanded to encompass broken forests from the tropics of Guatemala and the northern slope of Alaska.|$|E
5|$|The first convoy from Belgium, {{carrying}} stateless Jews, left Mechelen {{transit camp}} for Auschwitz on 4 August 1942 {{and was soon}} followed by others. These trains left for <b>extermination</b> camps in Eastern Europe. Between October 1942 and January 1943, deportations were temporarily halted; by this time 16,600 people have been deported on 17 rail convoys. As the result of Queen Elisabeth's intervention with the German authorities, all of those deported in this first wave were not Belgian citizens. In 1943, the deportations resumed. By the time that deportations to <b>extermination</b> camps had begun, however, nearly 2,250 Belgian Jews had already been deported as forced laborers for , a civil and military engineering group, which {{was working on the}} construction of the Atlantic Wall in Northern France.|$|E
