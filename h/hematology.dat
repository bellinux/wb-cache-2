5|$|<b>Hematology</b> (also {{known as}} Haematology) – {{the study of}} blood and blood-forming organs.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1980s, the Farrars {{were living in}} Cincinnati, Ohio. During this time Green {{suffered}} a number of medical issues, including surgery on an infected wrist, cerebellar migraines, and insomnia. The Farrars' first child, Timothy, was born on January 20, 1982. After a six-week maternity leave, Green returned to her fellowship in <b>hematology</b> and oncology at the University of Cincinnati.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 Rhoads {{joined the}} staff of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, now Rockefeller University, where he worked for Simon Flexner. He was also staff {{pathologist}} at Rockefeller Hospital. His early research interests included <b>hematology</b> and poliomyelitis. He worked at Rockefeller until 1939.|$|E
5|$|Stossel's brother, Thomas P. Stossel, is a Harvard Medical School {{professor}} and {{co-director of the}} <b>Hematology</b> Division at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital. He {{has served on the}} advisory boards of pharmaceutical companies such as Merck and Pfizer. Stossel's nephew is journalist and magazine editor Scott Stossel.|$|E
5|$|Andrews {{graduated}} from the University of Florida with a bachelor's degree in therapeutic recreation in 1986, and thereafter, from Ohio State University with a master's degree in clinical social work. From 1992 to 1999, {{she worked as a}} clinical social worker in children's <b>hematology</b> and cancer treatment at the University of Virginia Health Science Center. Andrews has worked for MBNA America and Bank of America since 1999; as a Bank of America vice president and market manager for consumer banking, she has oversees fifteen banking centers in Delaware and Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his study}} in Puerto Rico, in 1933 Rhoads {{was chosen to}} lead a special service at the Rockefeller Institute in {{clinical}} <b>hematology,</b> to study diseases of the blood-forming organs. He built on his research on anemia and tropical sprue. In 1934 Rhoads and another researcher published results of the success in using liver extract therapy to treat tropical sprue (and relieve anemia). Their work was recognized as contributing benefit in treatment of the disease by others in the field.|$|E
5|$|Laubenstein {{was raised}} in Barrington, Rhode Island, where a {{childhood}} bout of polio left her paraplegic and using a wheelchair {{for the rest of}} her life. She studied at Barnard College and received her medical degree from New York University School of Medicine, where she specialized in <b>hematology</b> and oncology and went on to become a clinical professor before leaving to focus on treating AIDS patients in her private practice. In addition to her medical work, she was an outspoken AIDS activist and co-founded a non-profit organization, Multitasking, which provided employment to people with AIDS.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, {{a second}} child, Kate, was born. Green again {{returned}} to her studies after maternity leave, and by 1985 had completed her fellowship. She went into private practice in <b>hematology</b> and oncology while Farrar finished {{the last year of}} his cardiology fellowship. Later Green and Farrar both joined established medical practices in the Kansas City, Missouri, area. After a year, Green started her own private practice, which prospered until she became pregnant and took time off work for another maternity leave. The couple's third child, Kelly, was born on December 13, 1988.|$|E
25|$|Beutler was a {{president}} of both the American Society of <b>Hematology</b> and the Western Association of Physicians. He also received a Doctor Philosophiae Honoris Causa, Tel Aviv University.He was also elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences and was presented with the inaugural Award for Lifetime Achievement from The American Society of <b>Hematology.</b>|$|E
25|$|With over 400 medical {{research}} facilities and 76 medical magazine indexes {{available in the}} country, Iran is the 19th country in {{medical research}} and is set to become the 10th within 10 years (2012). Clinical sciences are invested in highly in Iran. In areas such as rheumatology, <b>hematology,</b> and bone marrow trasplantation, Iranian medical scientists publish regularly. The <b>Hematology,</b> Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Research Center (HORC) of Tehran University of Medical Sciences in Shariati Hospital was established in 1991. Internationally, this center {{is one of the}} largest bone marrow transplantation centers and has carried out a large number of successful transplantations. According to a study conducted in 2005, associated specialized pediatric <b>hematology</b> and oncology (PHO) services exist in almost all major cities throughout the country, where 43 board-certified or eligible pediatric hematologist–oncologists are giving care to children suffering from cancer or hematological disorders. Three children's medical centers at universities have approved PHO fellowship programs. Besides <b>hematology,</b> gastroenterology has recently attracted many talented medical students. The gasteroenterology research center based at Tehran University has produced increasing numbers of scientific publications since its establishment.|$|E

25|$|He holds {{numerous}} patents, and {{his academic}} interests include {{the application of}} technology in medical diagnostics, including immunochemistry, molecular diagnostics, computer-aided instruction, digital imaging in pathology, {{and the use of}} automated techniques in cytopathology and <b>hematology.</b>|$|E
25|$|Laboratory {{hemoglobin}} {{test methods}} require {{a blood sample}} (arterial, venous, or capillary) and analysis on <b>hematology</b> analyzer and CO-oximeter. Additionally, a new noninvasive hemoglobin (SpHb) test method called Pulse CO-Oximetry is also available with comparable accuracy to invasive methods.|$|E

25|$|Transfusion {{medicine}} is a specialized branch of <b>hematology</b> that {{is concerned with}} the study of blood groups, along with the work of a blood bank to provide a transfusion service for blood and other blood products. Across the world, blood products must be prescribed by a medical doctor (licensed physician or surgeon) in a similar way as medicines.|$|E
25|$|An MD or a DNB (general {{medicine}} or paediatrics) {{is the basic}} requirement for specialisation in Cardiology, Nephrology, Neonatology, Gastro-enterology, Neurology except for Clinical <b>Hematology</b> (Pathology or general medicine), etc., while an MS or a DNB (general surgery, ENT or Orthopaedic surgery) is the basic requirement for Neurosurgery, Urology, Cardio-thoracic & Vascular Surgery, Gastrointestinal Surgery, Paediatric Surgery, Plastic Surgery, etc.|$|E
25|$|Anatomic {{pathology}} {{relates to}} the processing, examination, and diagnosis of surgical specimens by a physician trained in pathological diagnosis. Clinical pathology is the division that processes the test requests more familiar to the general public; such as blood cell counts, coagulation studies, urinalysis, blood glucose level determinations and throat cultures. Its subsections include chemistry, <b>hematology,</b> microbiology, immunology, urinalysis and blood bank.|$|E
25|$|Part 3 (1.5 years) – Pathology (Histopathology), Medical Microbiology, Chemical Pathology, <b>Hematology,</b> Forensic Pathology, Immunology and Toxicology. A {{professional}} exam {{is written}} {{at the end}} of the third year and the student has to pass to proceed. There are also surgery and medicine rotations during the year. Also, the students cover most of the basic Pharmacology during the third stage of the degrees.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{destruction}} of platelets by splenic macrophages, the spleen is normally not enlarged. In fact, an enlarged spleen should lead to a search for other possible causes for the thrombocytopenia. Bleeding time is usually prolonged in ITP patients. However, the use of bleeding time in diagnosis is discouraged by the American Society of <b>Hematology</b> practice guidelines and a normal bleeding time does not exclude a platelet disorder.|$|E
25|$|The UC San Diego Medical Center is a well-regarded {{teaching}} hospital. Residency and fellowship {{programs are}} available in most medical specialties, including allergy, anesthesia, cardiology, emergency medicine, endocrinology, gastroenterology, geriatric medicine, <b>hematology,</b> hyperbaric medicine, immunology, internal medicine, nephrology, oncology, pediatrics, pulmonary and critical care medicine, and rheumatology. Hospital teams may be composed of attending physicians, hospitalists, residents, fellows, interns, medical students, and clinical pharmacists, but medical students would only be involved in care under an attending physician's supervision.|$|E
25|$|Economic demand {{influences}} {{the location of}} particular specialties. For example, more orthopedic surgeons are found in ski areas, obstetricians in the suburbs, and boutique specialties such as hypnosis, plastic surgery, psychiatry {{are more likely to}} practice in high income areas. Small populations can usually only support primary care. A large population is needed to support specialists who treat rare diseases. Some specialties need to cooperate and thus locate near each other, such as <b>hematology,</b> oncology, and pathology, or cardiology, thoracic surgery and pulmonology.|$|E
25|$|Clinical {{laboratory}} sciences are {{the clinical}} diagnostic services that apply laboratory techniques to diagnosis {{and management of}} patients. In the United States, these services are supervised by a pathologist. The personnel that work in these medical laboratory departments are technically trained staff who do not hold medical degrees, but who usually hold an undergraduate medical technology degree, who actually perform the tests, assays, and procedures needed for providing the specific services. Subspecialties include transfusion medicine, cellular pathology, clinical chemistry, <b>hematology,</b> clinical microbiology and clinical immunology.|$|E
25|$|Accreditation {{programs}} exist {{with professional}} bodies in most developed countries, ensuring {{the quality and}} consistency of education. In Canada, one may obtain the professional certification title – Certified Exercise Physiologist for those working with clients (both clinical and non clinical) in the health and fitness industry. An exercise physiologist's area of study may include but {{is not limited to}} biochemistry, bioenergetics, cardiopulmonary function, <b>hematology,</b> biomechanics, skeletal muscle physiology, neuroendocrine function, and central and peripheral nervous system function. Furthermore, exercise physiologists range from basic scientists, to clinical researchers, to clinicians, to sports trainers.|$|E
25|$|Slătineanu {{was head}} of the public health {{directorate}} from 1918 to 1920. He continued developing the laboratory, which eventually had three sections: bacteriology, physical chemistry and biochemistry, and <b>hematology</b> and histopathology. Its professionalism brought success: work contracts brought significant sums; medical, veterinary, military and civilian authorities sought its services; and it certified the quality of laboratory glass manufactured domestically. In 1919, while Cantacuzino was attending the Paris Peace Conference as a delegate, Slătineanu taught at the experimental medicine department in Bucharest. In 1920, he initiated a course on infectious diseases and set up an isolation unit for contagious diseases at Sfântul Spiridon Hospital in Iași.|$|E
25|$|The {{technology}} has applications {{in a number}} of fields, including molecular biology, pathology, immunology, plant biology and marine biology. It has broad application in medicine especially in transplantation, <b>hematology,</b> tumor immunology and chemotherapy, prenatal diagnosis, genetics and sperm sorting for sex preselection. Also, it is extensively used in research for the detection of DNA damage, caspase cleavage and apoptosis. In neuroscience, co-expression of cell surface and intracellular antigens can also be analyzed. In marine biology, the autofluorescent properties of photosynthetic plankton can be exploited by flow cytometry in order to characterise abundance and community structure. In protein engineering, flow cytometry is used in conjunction with yeast display and bacterial display to identify cell surface-displayed protein variants with desired properties.|$|E
25|$|Physician {{assistant}} {{education is}} based on medical education although unlike medical school which lasts four years plus a specialty-specific residency, PA training is usually 2 to 3 years of full-time study, completed during their post-graduate studies, {{for a total of}} 6–7 years of science-based postsecondary education. The didactic training of PA education consists of classroom and laboratory instruction in medical and behavioral sciences, such as anatomy, microbiology, immunology, pharmacology, pathophysiology, <b>hematology,</b> pathology, genetics, clinical medicine, and physical diagnosis, followed by clinical rotations in internal medicine, family medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, emergency medicine, and geriatric medicine, as well as elective rotations. Unlike physicians, who must complete a minimum of three years of residency after completion of medical school, PAs are not required to complete such residencies after they complete their schooling. Despite this, there are residency programs in certain specialties for PAs who choose to continue formal education in such a format.|$|E
25|$|Leishmaniasis is {{diagnosed}} in the <b>hematology</b> laboratory by direct visualization of the amastigotes (Leishman-Donovan bodies). Buffy-coat preparations of peripheral blood or aspirates from marrow, spleen, lymph nodes, or skin lesions should be spread on a slide {{to make a}} thin smear and stained with Leishman stain or Giemsa stain (pH 7.2) for 20 minutes. Amastigotes are seen within blood and spleen monocytes or, less commonly, in circulating neutrophils and in aspirated tissue macrophages. They are small, round bodies 2–4 μm in diameter with indistinct cytoplasm, a nucleus, and a small, rod-shaped kinetoplast. Occasionally, amastigotes may be seen lying free between cells. However, the retrieval of tissue samples is often painful for the patient and identification of the infected cells can be difficult. So, other indirect immunological methods of diagnosis are developed, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, antigen-coated dipsticks, and direct agglutination test. Although these tests are readily available, {{they are not the}} standard diagnostic tests due to their insufficient sensitivity and specificity.|$|E
500|$|When venous {{thromboembolism}} {{occurs when}} a patient is experiencing transient major risk factors such as prolonged immobility, surgery, or trauma, testing for thrombophilia is not appropriate because {{the outcome of the}} test would not change a patient's indicated treatment. In 2013, the American Society of <b>Hematology,</b> as part of recommendations in the Choosing Wisely campaign, cautioned against overuse of thrombophilia screening; false positive results of testing would lead to people inappropriately being labeled as having thrombophilia, and being treated with anticoagulants without clinical need ...|$|E
500|$|The only {{predator}} {{known to}} target this species is the fossa, although the golden-crowned sifaka {{reacts to the}} presence of birds of prey with alarm calls. [...] A <b>hematology</b> and serum chemistry study published in 1995 revealed that 59% of the wild golden-crowned sifakas sampled were infected with a microfilarial parasite, a potentially unknown species of nematode in the genus Mansonella. [...] Healthy, infected individuals {{did not appear to be}} adversely affected by the infestation, but the overall effect on the dwindling population is unknown. [...] Also, no malarial or intestinal parasites were found, although 48% of the golden-crowned sifakas examined had external ear mites.|$|E
500|$|A {{specialist}} in <b>hematology</b> and oncology, and clinical {{professor at the}} New York University Medical Center, {{she was one of}} the first in the United States to recognize the appearance of the AIDS epidemic. While working in private practice in New York City, she observed a sudden increase in the number of cases of Kaposi's sarcoma—a rare cancer that would later be identified as an AIDS-defining illness—in young gay men with immune deficiencies. With Alvin Friedman-Kien, a dermatologist, she co-authored the first published article on the appearance of Kaposi's sarcoma in gay men. The first patient she diagnosed with Kaposi's sarcoma, in 1979, was a gay man with a generalized rash and enlarged lymph nodes; two weeks later, a colleague asked her to see a second patient, another gay man, with the same disease. Both men turned out to be friends with Gaëtan Dugas—often called the [...] "patient zero" [...] of HIV/AIDS in North America (though more recent studies suggest otherwise)—who the men told Laubenstein had a similar rash. In 1981, when Dugas, a Canadian, heard about Kaposi's sarcoma, he traveled to New York from Montreal to consult with Laubenstein and Friedman-Kien and visited their practice for monthly chemotherapy treatments. By 1982, Laubenstein had treated 62 patients with Kaposi's sarcoma. She later left her university position to focus on treating AIDS patients in her private practice.|$|E
500|$|... "Stronger" [...] {{was also}} used in various forms of media. It was used in a 2011 Toyota Camry {{advertisement}} which stars Clarkson singing the song with her co-stars Chris Berman, Andrew Zimmern, and James Lipton. [...] Amber Riley, Naya Rivera, and Heather Morris performed the song on the season three episode of Glee titled [...] "On My Way", which aired on February 21, 2012. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal described the trio's performance as [...] "fine, fierce and fabulous." [...] Their version of [...] "Stronger" [...] debuted on the Hot 100 at number 66 on the week ending March 3, 2012 as [...] "What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger)". The song was featured in Suburgatory and was used in advertisements promoting the second season of the USA Network series Fairly Legal. It was also featured in a playable piece in the Harmonix video game Rock Band Blitz, Rock Band 3 and Dance Central 3. On May 6, 2012, a video {{of some of the}} patients and hospital staff of Seattle Children's <b>hematology</b> oncology unit dancing to the song were uploaded in YouTube to represent their fight against cancer. The video became a viral hit and has been featured by Time and CBS News. On February 26, 2012, Chemmy Alcott and Sean Rice skated to the song on Dancing on Ice. Maria Menounos and Derek Hough danced to the song in the fourteenth season of Dancing with the Stars. The instrumental version has been used as background music to the promotion and the opening theme to the 2013 MDA Show of Strength telethon. Hillary Clinton references [...] "Stronger" [...] early in her 2017 book [...] "What Happened" [...] regarding the 2016 US presidential election, [...] "'That which does not kill us makes us stronger.' —Friedrich Nietzsche (and Kelly Clarkson)".|$|E
