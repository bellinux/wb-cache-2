5|$|After the rut, females form large {{herds of}} up to 50 individuals. Newborn calves are kept close {{by a series of}} vocalizations; larger {{nurseries}} have an ongoing and constant chatter during the daytime hours. When approached by predators, the largest and most robust females may make a stand, using their front legs to kick at their attackers. Guttural <b>grunts</b> <b>and</b> posturing effectively deter all but the most determined predators.|$|E
5|$|Hippopotamuses {{appear to}} {{communicate}} vocally, through <b>grunts</b> <b>and</b> bellows, {{and they may}} practice echolocation, but {{the purpose of these}} vocalizations is currently unknown. Hippos have the unique ability to hold their heads partially above the water and send out a cry that travels through both water and air; individuals respond above and under water. Hippos will also express threat and alarm with exhalations.|$|E
5|$|The known diet of the {{dusky shark}} {{encompasses}} pelagic fishes, including herring and anchovies, tuna and mackerel, billfish, jacks, needlefish and flyingfish, threadfins, hairtails, lancetfish, and lanternfish; demersal fishes, including mullets, porgies, <b>grunts,</b> <b>and</b> flatheads, eels, lizardfish, cusk eels, gurnards, and flatfish; reef fishes, including barracudas, goatfish, spadefish, groupers, scorpionfish, and porcupinefish; cartilaginous fishes, including dogfish, sawsharks, angel sharks, catsharks, thresher sharks, smoothhounds, smaller requiem sharks, sawfish, guitarfish, skates, stingrays, and butterfly rays; and invertebrates, including cephalopods, decapod crustaceans, barnacles, and sea stars. Very rarely, the largest dusky sharks may also consume sea turtles, marine mammals (mainly as carrion), and human refuse.|$|E

5|$|The California condor has a {{long life}} span, {{reaching}} up to 60 years. If it survives to adulthood, the condor has few natural threats other than humans. Because they lack a syrinx, their vocal display is limited to <b>grunts</b> <b>and</b> hisses. Condors bathe frequently and can spend hours a day preening their feathers. Condors also perform urohidrosis, or defecate on their legs, to reduce their body temperature. There is a well-developed social structure within large groups of condors, with competition to determine a pecking order decided by body language, competitive play behavior, {{and a variety of}} hisses and grunts. This social hierarchy is displayed especially when the birds feed, with the dominant birds eating before the younger ones.|$|E
5|$|Wildebeest do {{not form}} {{permanent}} pair bonds {{and during the}} mating season, or rut, the males establish temporary territories and try to attract females into them. These small territories are about 3000 m2, with up to 300 territories per km2. The males defend these territories from other males while competing for females that are coming into season. The males use <b>grunts</b> <b>and</b> distinctive behaviour to entice females into their territories. Wildebeest usually breed {{at the end of}} the rainy season when the animals are well fed and at their peak of fitness. This usually occurs between May and July, and birthing usually takes place between January and March, at the start of the wet season. Wildebeest females breed seasonally and ovulate spontaneously.|$|E
5|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} at eight months, but mate no earlier than two years. Males mature later, at one-and-a-half years. Mating takes place {{throughout}} the year; peaks occur during {{spring and fall}} in Texas. Two peaks have been observed in India: from August to October and from March to April. Rutting males aggressively establish and defend their territories from other males, giving out loud <b>grunts</b> <b>and</b> engaging in serious head-to-head fights, pushing each other using horns. Aggressive display consists of thrusting the neck forward and raising it, folding the ears and raising the tail. The dominant male pursues the female with his nose pointing upward, smells her urine and shows a flehmen response. The female shows her receptivity by waving her tail and thumping the hindlegs on the ground. This is followed by several mounting attempts, and copulation. The whole process may {{last as long as}} six hours. The female will remain still for some time after copulation, following which she may start grazing. The male may then move on to mate with another female.|$|E

50|$|Yaks <b>grunt</b> <b>and,</b> unlike cattle, are {{not known}} to produce the {{characteristic}} bovine lowing (mooing) sound, which inspired the scientific names of both yak variants, Bos grunniens (<b>grunting</b> bull) <b>and</b> Bos mutus (silent bull).|$|R
5|$|Vocalisations are {{frequent}} as the juveniles disperse, {{and again as}} they congregate in the morning. Nearby adults, presumably the parents, also give signals warning of predators or alerting the youngsters {{to the presence of}} food. The range and quantity of vocalisations vary between species. Alligators are the noisiest, while some crocodile species are almost completely silent. Adult female New Guinea crocodiles and Siamese crocodiles roar when approached by another adult, while Nile crocodiles grunt or bellow in a similar situation. The American alligator is exceptionally noisy; it emits a series of about seven throaty bellows, each a couple of seconds long, at ten second intervals. It also makes various <b>grunts</b> <b>and</b> hisses. Males create vibrations in the water to send out infrasonic signals that serve to attract females and intimidate rivals. The enlarged boss of the male gharial may serve as a sound resonator.|$|E

25|$|Marbled polecats {{are most}} active {{during the morning}} and evening. Their {{eyesight}} is weak and they rely on a well-developed sense of smell. Vocalization is limited and consists of shrill alarm cries, <b>grunts</b> <b>and</b> a submissive long shriek.|$|E

25|$|Yellowtail {{amberjack}} {{can form}} packs of 7-15 individuals that maneuver in U-shaped formations {{to cut away}} {{the tail end of}} prey shoals (jack mackerels or Cortez <b>grunts)</b> <b>and</b> herd the downsized shoal next to seawalls where they proceed to capture the prey.|$|E
25|$|When in distress, the bongo emits a bleat. It uses {{a limited}} number of vocalisations, mostly <b>grunts</b> <b>and</b> snorts; females have a weak mooing contact-call for their young. Females prefer to use {{traditional}} calving grounds restricted to certain areas, while newborn calves lie in hiding for a week or more, receiving short visits by the mother to suckle.|$|E
25|$|Twenty-five {{distinct}} vocalisations are recognised, many {{of which}} are used primarily for group communication within dense vegetation. Sounds classified as <b>grunts</b> <b>and</b> barks are heard most frequently while traveling, and indicate the whereabouts of individual group members. They may also be used during social interactions when discipline is required. Screams and roars signal alarm or warning, and are produced most often by silverbacks. Deep, rumbling belches suggest contentment and are heard frequently during feeding and resting periods. They are {{the most common form of}} intragroup communication.|$|E

25|$|Ghostface {{is rarely}} {{depicted}} as speaking while physically on screen, {{in order to}} aid in concealing {{the identity of the}} character behind the mask. Exceptions to this are <b>grunts</b> <b>and</b> groans when injured, which are dubbed into the film during the editing phase by Jackson. Ghostface only speaks physically on screen on two occasions in the series; on those two occasions, it is just before his true identity is revealed. The voice given to the character, provided by Jackson, is used when talking to another character over the phone or to display the use of the voice changer when the killer reveals himself. Despite being portrayed by different characters in each film, Ghostface displays similar personality and physical attributes regardless of who is wearing the costume or speaking to a target.|$|E
25|$|After the rut, females form large {{herds of}} up to 50 individuals. The newborn calves are kept close to the hinds {{by a series of}} vocalizations between the two, and larger {{nurseries}} have an ongoing and constant chatter during the daytime hours. When approached by predators, the largest and most robust females may make a stand, using their front legs to kick at their attackers. Guttural <b>grunts</b> <b>and</b> posturing is used with all but the most determined of predators with great effectiveness. Aside from humans and domestic dogs, the gray wolf is probably the most dangerous predator European red deer encounter. Occasionally, the brown bear will prey on European red deer. Eurasian lynx and wild boars sometimes prey on the calves. The leopard in Asia Minor (now extinct) probably preyed on eastern European red deer. Both the Barbary lion and the Barbary leopard probably once preyed on Atlas stags in the Atlas Mountains, although the Barbary lion is now extinct in the wild, and the Barbary leopard is either very rare or extinct. In the past they were also hunted by the now extinct Caspian tiger.|$|E
500|$|... "Given {{the rural}} {{nature of the}} story, and the {{tendency}} of most local acting to lean towards the theatrical, {{it was clear that}} non-actors drawn from hutments, labor camps and the vast Indian middle class were the right choice," [...] said Domalpalli, referring to his choice of casting. In addition, the inclusion of Radhamma's character was to bring a natural feel for the film. Her behavior such as the way she [...] "sits, stands, moves, <b>grunts</b> <b>and</b> groansâ€” that is the way people from a village talk and behave... You would immediately recognize a person who served you breakfast... That makes a point." ...|$|E

500|$|Ito {{wanted to}} create [...] "a monster with a hidden face", but became unhappy with his designs, which resembled humans wearing masks. He then drew a monster with a pyramid-shaped head. According to Ito, the triangle's sharp right and acute angles suggest the {{possibility}} of pain. Of the creatures that appear in Silent Hill 2, only Pyramid Head features an [...] "overtly masculine" [...] appearance. He resembles a pale, muscular man covered with a white, blood-soaked robe reminiscent of a butcher's smock. He does not speak, but <b>grunts</b> <b>and</b> moans painfully. His most outstanding feature is his large red, triangular head. [...] His weapons consist of the deadly and heavy Great Knife, which the player can find and use {{for the rest of}} the game, and later a spear.|$|E
500|$|Music {{commentator}} Nelson George, {{compared the}} song to material from Dangerous, notably the critically acclaimed tracks [...] "Jam" [...] and [...] "Dangerous". He {{described it as}} a [...] "pile driving" [...] song that [...] "explodes from radio speakers". A longtime commentator on Jackson's public life, J. Randy Taraborrelli, gave a retrospective analysis of the album in the biography, The Magic & the Madness. Taraborrelli thought that [...] "Blood on the Dance Floor" [...] was one of Jackson's best songs, a song that US fans [...] "don't even know exists". In 2005, J T Griffith, of Allmusic, believed that in hindsight, [...] "Blood on the Dance Floor" [...] was actually a good song. He explained, [...] " [...] a second-rate mixture of 'Beat It' and 'Thriller' but Jackson's missteps are better than most pop music out there. This track showcases all the artist's trademarks: the ooohing, the <b>grunts,</b> <b>and</b> funky basslines. It is hard to hear 'Blood on the Dance Floor' and not want to moonwalk or dance like a ghoul".|$|E
500|$|Up {{to twelve}} human players choose their pilot types and are {{dropped on the}} map, {{beginning}} the game. Titans can be deployed periodically, based on an onscreen timer, which must complete its countdown to zero before a Titan can be summoned. Killing other players reduces {{the amount of time}} remaining. When summoned, players are told to [...] "standby for Titanfall", whereupon a Titan drops from the sky, surrounded by a protective forcefield. Unlike player-characters in games like Call of Duty and Battlefield, pilots are agile and accumulate momentum while running (similar to Tribes). Players run on walls, double jump with a jet pack, vault over obstacles, glide across ziplines, and chain together combos. Pilot and Titan controls are identical except where the pilot's double jump becomes the Titan's dash, as Titans cannot jump. The Titans, somewhere between battle tanks and a mecha, are slower than the nimble pilots. Battles include artificial intelligence soldiers (human <b>grunts</b> <b>and</b> robotic spectres) that are designed as human player competition, support, and scenery. Games end with a race to the losing team's evacuation dropship.|$|E
