25|$|There {{are many}} {{techniques}} by which heat may be delivered. Some {{of the most}} common involve the use of focused ultrasound (FUS or HIFU), microwave heating, induction heating, magnetic hyperthermia, and direct application of heat through the use of heated saline pumped through catheters. Experiments with carbon nanotubes that selectively bind to cancer cells have been performed. Lasers are then used that pass harmlessly through the body, but heat the nanotubes, causing the death of the cancer cells. Similar results have also been achieved with other types of nanoparticles, including gold-coated nanoshells and nanorods that exhibit certain degrees of 'tunability' of the absorption properties of the nanoparticles to the wavelength of light for irradiation. The success of this approach to cancer treatment rests on the existence of an 'optical window' in which biological tissue (i.e., healthy cells) are completely transparent at the wavelength of the laser light, while nanoparticles are highly absorbing at the same wavelength. Such a 'window' exists in the so-called near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. In this way, the laser light can pass through the system without harming healthy tissue, and only diseased cells, where the nanoparticles reside, <b>get</b> <b>hot</b> and are killed.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, back on Earth, {{with their}} members running low on energon and slowly being {{captured}} by Skywatch, tension is high amongst the Autobots. After a rescue raid led by Hot Rod results in Ironhide's death, Optimus Prime gives up {{his position as}} leader and surrenders to Skywatch, causing a schism between the Autobots, who split into two groups: one led by Hot Rod, who, taking the name [...] "Rodimus", joins forces {{with a group of}} Decepticons fronted by Swindle in an effort to build a ship and leave the planet, and a second who elect Bumblebee as their new leader, and are soon joined by Ultra Magnus, who determines to arrest Rodimus for treason. More Autobots, fearing they will be arrested by Magnus, also go AWOL, but most of them are captured by Skywatch and used as a bargaining tool by Spike Witwicky to force information out of Optimus Prime. Thundercracker, having been shot down by Skywarp three years previously, starts to develop admiration for Earth and its inhabitants. Although Bumblebee was elected as Autobot leader, he gets little respect, as Autobots strike out on their own or disrespect his authority. A rogue faction within Skywatch contacts the Autobots and sets up a meeting with Bumblebee to enlist the Autobots' help in capturing Decepticons. Bumblebee agrees and the bots are fitted with special badges to cloak them from the main Skywatch force, but when the Colonel orders the capture of Blurr and resentment ensues, the Autobots learn that the badges also have the ability to immobilize them. Meanwhile, Magnus arrives at Hot Rod's camp and attempts to capture Swindle, but is stopped by Hot Rod. He also fails in trying to <b>get</b> <b>Hot</b> Rod to disassemble the ship his party is building to get off Earth. In the battle that follows, Swindle betrays Rodimus and reveals his new creation, Menasor, but the day is saved thanks to Skywatch, with whom Optimus Prime has brokered an alliance, and some timely side-switching from the disillusioned Thundercracker. The disgraced Rodimus flees Earth alone, and the Autobots rally under Bumblebee.|$|E

Its lead single titled [...] "She's in Love with the Boy" [...] peaked at number 1 on the Billboard Country Chart in late 1991, bringing her national success. Three other singles from her debut album also reached the Top10 {{on the country}} chart — [...] "Like We Never Had a Broken Heart" [...] (co-written by Garth Brooks), [...] "The Woman Before Me", and [...] "That's What I Like About You". Her album eventually sold one million copies and was certified Platinum (and later on, 2× Platinum), with Yearwood therefore also becoming the first female artist to sell a million copies of her first album. AllMusic reviewed the album and called the effort [...] "a very classy debut that stands the test of time", giving it {{four and a half}} out of five stars. It also received another positive review from Entertainment Weekly, who said that Yearwood's voice [...] "demonstrates technical and emotional authority at every turn." [...] With success, Yearwood performed on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, as well as the Late Show with David Letterman. She was also the subject of the book <b>Get</b> <b>Hot</b> or Go Home, a full-length biography of Yearwood's life and career written by Lisa Gubernick.|$|E
2500|$|Lithium is {{generally}} present in brown dwarfs {{and not in}} low-mass stars. Stars, which reach the high temperature necessary for fusing hydrogen, rapidly deplete their lithium. Fusion of lithium-7 and a proton occurs producing two helium-4 nuclei. The temperature necessary for this reaction is just below that necessary for hydrogen fusion. Convection in low-mass stars ensures that lithium in the whole volume of the star is eventually depleted. Therefore, {{the presence of the}} lithium spectral line in a candidate brown dwarf is a strong indicator that it is indeed a substellar object. The use of lithium to distinguish candidate brown dwarfs from low-mass stars is commonly referred to as the lithium test, and was pioneered by , Eduardo Martín and Antonio Magazzu. However, lithium is also seen in very young stars, which have not yet had enough time to burn it all. Heavier stars, like the Sun, can retain lithium in their outer atmospheres, which never <b>get</b> <b>hot</b> enough and the convective layer does not mix with the core where the lithium would be rapidly depleted. Those larger stars are also distinguishable from brown dwarfs by their size and luminosity. On the contrary, brown dwarfs at the high end of their mass range can be hot enough to deplete their lithium when they are young. Dwarfs of mass greater than [...] can burn their lithium by the time they are half a billion years old, thus the lithium test is not perfect.|$|E
2500|$|Bale had initial {{concerns}} about playing Batman, {{as he felt}} more ridiculous than intimidating in the Batsuit. He dealt with this by depicting Batman as a savage beast. To attain {{a deeper understanding of}} the character, Bale read various Batman comic books. He explained his interpretation of the young boy: [...] "Batman is his hidden, demonic rage-filled side. The creature Batman creates is an absolutely sincere creature and one that he has to control but does so in a very haphazard way. He's capable of enacting violence— and to kill— so he's constantly having to rein himself in." [...] For Bale, the most gruelling part about playing Batman was the suit. [...] "You stick it on, you <b>get</b> <b>hot,</b> you sweat and you get a headache in the mask ... But I'm not going to bitch about it because I get to play Batman", he said. Bale trained in Wing Chun Kung Fu under Eric Oram in preparation for the movie. When promoting the film in interviews and public events, Bale retained an American accent to avoid confusion. Batman Begins was released in the U.S. on 15 June 2005 and was a U.S. and international triumph for Warner Bros., costing approximately US$135 million to produce and taking in over US$370 million in returns worldwide. Bale's performance was well received by critics and fans alike, earning him the Saturn Award for Best Actor and the Best Hero award at the 2006 MTV Movie Awards. He also provided his voice and likeness for the video game adaptation of the film.|$|E
