40|$|Radiotelemetry is an {{important}} tool for wildlife management and research, {{but in some cases}} attachment of neck collars can be problematic. An alternative in large mammals is to attach transmitters to the ear, though little is published about ear-tag radiotransmitter integrity (i. e., how long a transmitter emits a useful signal) and retention (i. e., how long a transmitter remains attached to an animal). Here we report <b>eartag</b> transmitter integrity and retention from 2 studies monitoring free-ranging calves (Bos taurus) in eastern Arizona, USA, and feral horse (Equus ferus) foals in northwestern Spain. Transmitter integrity and retention was lower for transmitters attached to foals then calves. The primary cause for reduced integrity was antennas breaking off, whereas the primary retention problem involved transmitters ripping out of the ear. When data were pooled across study sites, mean integrity and retention loss was 111 days and 180 days, respectively.

40|$|Late {{detection}} of emergency diseases causes significant economic losses for pig producers and governments. As {{the first signs}} of animal infection are usually fever and reduced motion that lead to reduced consumption of water and feed, we developed a novel smart system to monitor body temperature and motion in real time, facilitating the early {{detection of}} infectious diseases. In this study, carried out {{within the framework of the}} European Union research project Rapidia Field, we tested the smart system on 10 pigs experimentally infected with two doses of an attenuated strain of African swine fever. Biosensors and an accelerometer embedded in an <b>eartag</b> captured data before and after infection, and video cameras were used to monitor the animals 24 h per day. The results showed that in 8 of 9 cases, the monitoring system detected infection onset as an increase in body temperature and decrease in movement before or simultaneously with fever detection based on rectal temperature measurement, observation of clinical signs, the decrease in water consumption or positive qPCR detection of virus. In addition, this decrease in movement was reliably detected using automatic analysis of video images therefore providing an inexpensive alternative to direct motion measurement. The system can be set up to alert staff when high fever, reduced motion or both are detected in one or more animals. This system may be useful for monitoring sentinel herds in real time, considerably reducing the financial and logistical costs of periodic sampling and increasing the chances of early detection of infection...|$|E
40|$|Radio {{frequency}} identification (RFID) {{systems were}} introduced in the 1970 ies mainly for farm management purposes. They were followed in the 1990 ies {{by the use of}} injectable transponders for companion animals. Since the beginning of this age, many countries have introduced animal identification schemes based upon RFID. The technology, its use and the testing of the equipment are defined in ISO standards. The International Committee for Animal Recording (ICAR) is the international registration authority for animal RFID and publishes approved products on its Website (www. icar. org). The low frequency signal is not influenced by body tissue, so the transponder technology can be used as <b>eartag,</b> injectable, bolus and leg tag. The RFID transponder itself does not give information about the animal or the owner of the animal, but the identification code (ID-code) links the animal to related information (of the animal and the owner) in a database. The database can be hosted on the farm, by the manufacturer of the RFID transponder or by a national body. A central database on a national level is preferable over a database on farm level, because tracking and tracing is much quicker and more effective, and other systems (such as herd book, Health Service) can be easily linked to it. The allocation of ID-codes being produced must be registered in a database to eliminate the risk of having identical ID-code for different animals. Depending on the coding of the transponder (country code or manufacturer code), the legal authority or the manufacturer of the transponders is responsible for maintaining such a database. At this stage, low frequency RFID technology is generally considered as the most efficient technology for identifying animals...|$|E
40|$|Animal {{movement}} monitors {{have been}} researched since the 1990 ’s. The advent of accelerometer technology into these monitors coupled with wireless technologies to transmit data, and finally sophisticated algorithms and software to transcribe data to graphical {{and easy to}} use decision tools on animal behavior has resulted in many recent behavioral monitor systems becoming commercially available for animals and people. For dairy, many of the systems are neck based on collars, but a recent one has incorporated the accelerometer into an <b>eartag</b> that also has a temperature sensor. At Iowa State University, 36 animals were fitted with an ear tag based behavior and temperature monitor (Cow Manager, Agis Automatisering, Netherlands) to evaluate behavior and ear temperature change and learn the system. Tags were put on breeding age heifers, lactating cows, and transition cows. 34 other tags were acquired and put on transition cows. The system has served multiple purposes at the ISU Dairy. These include monitoring of animals and the herd from a commercial herd standpoint;teaching tool to introduce and embed undergraduate, graduate, and veterinary studentsin the technology(7 classes to date);a platform for 5 undergraduate independent studies to date;and utilized in 5 research projects to date including heat stress, calving behavior, LPS challenge model, calves, and evaluating animals as they adjust to Calan gate feeders. The system has also been a platform for extension presentations both at the ISU Dairy as well as many extension meetings and invited conferences and presentations. The behavior monitoring system has resulted in an excellent herd monitoring and decision system, as well as a teaching, research, and extension tool.

40|$|In 1986 {{a project}} {{was set up}} to {{determine}} the constraints to production of Zebu cattle under trypanosomiasis risk in the Ghibe valley. Approximately 1800 East African Zebu cattle (EAZC) were resident within the Ghibe valleey during the experimental period (1986 - 1992) and were maintained under traditional management. Tsetse populations were surveyed using unbaited blue biconical traps from 1986 - to 1990, and traps baited with acetone and cow urine from 1990 - 1992, 600 <b>eartagged</b> EAZC from seven herds were monitored and weighed.

40|$|All {{dairy cows}} in Europe wear unique {{identification}} tags in their ears. These <b>eartags</b> are standardized and contains the cows identification numbers, today only used for visual identification by the farmer. The cow {{also needs to}} be identified by an automatic identification system connected to milk machines and other robotics used at the farm. Currently this is solved with a non-standardized radio transmitter which can be placed on different places on the cow and different receivers needs to be used on different farms. Other drawbacks with the currently used identification system are that it is expensive and unreliable. This thesis explores the possibility to replace this non standardized radio frequency based identification system with a standardized computer vision based system. The method proposed in this thesis uses a color threshold approach for detection, a flood fill approach followed by Hough transform and a projection method for segmentation and evaluates template matching, k-nearest neighbour and support vector machines as optical character recognition methods.

40|$|International audienceThis study {{compared}} {{reproductive performance}} and behaviour of does {{raised in a}} group-housing system and in a regular cage system. The group-housing pen was divided into different functional areas for suckling, resting, and eating and special hiding areas for kits when they had left the nest-boxes and does to favour the species specific behavioural traits. Does had access to their nest-box {{by means of an}} individual Electronic Nest-box Recognition System (ENRS) activated by a coded transponder placed in their <b>eartags.</b> Eight does were housed in each pen. Natural mating (NM, with a buck in the group) or artificial inseminations (AI) were applied. Litter size, kit mortality and kit weight at 14 d of age were similar for group-housing and cages when NM were applied. With a natural reproduction rhythm group-housing led to an increase of + 38 % of litters. However, from a management point of view, a cycled production system with AI is preferred. With AI and group-housing, a lower kindling rate and a lower kit weight at weaning were found. The lower kindling rate was partly caused by pseudo-pregnancies that were found in 23 % ($P < 0. 01 $) of the does in the group-housing system against 0 % in the control group. Sixteen to 20 % of the does in the group-housing system had skin injuries, which is an indicator for aggression among does. Most of the injuries were seen on the body and most of them were superficial bites. Based on the results of this study, it can be concluded that group-housing of rabbit does seems possible, but {{more research is needed to}} solve the problems of the decreased kindling rate and occurrence of pseudo-pregnancies, the lower weight at weaning and aggressiveness among does...|$|R
40|$|Influence {{of stage}} of {{lactation}} and level of milk production on conception rates after timed artificial insemination following Ovsynch It was {{the objective of this}} study to investigate, whether conception rates after timed artificial insemination (TAI), are influenced by the {{stage of lactation}} or the level of milk production. In the experiment 1288 Holstein cows of a commercial dairy herd in Brandenburg, Germany, were used. All cows were examined by palpation of the uterus between 14 and 21 days in milk (DIM) for signs of endometritis. Cows were assigned to two different groups according to final digit of their <b>eartag</b> numbers. Each of the two main groups was subdivided into three categories by production level (high, average, low). Production levels were defined by the average daily milk production of the cows during the 5 th week of lactation. This resulted in 6 subgroups that could be compared, based on their production level or based on the timing of synchronisation in the course of lactation. Classification was done separately for primiparous and multiparous cows to account for expected differences in milk production between the age groups. All cows with uneven <b>eartag</b> numbers were synchronized with Ovsynch for timed artificial insemination (TAI) between 73 and 81 DIM irrespective of their milk production level (Group &# 65533;Simultaneous Ovsynch, SO&# 65533;). The second group (&# 65533;Production Ovsynch, PO&# 65533;) was subdivided into three production classes (i. e. low, average, high) and synchronized at three different stages of lactation, with low producing cows starting early (TAI at 53 to 59 DIM), cows with average production synchronized with Group SO (TAI at 74 to 80 DIM) and cows with high production level starting three weeks after those (TAI at 94 to 102 DIM). The protocol for synchronization was identical for all cows in the trial: Cows were treated with a GnRH analogue (0. 1 mg of D-Phe- 6 -Gonadorelin, Depherelin&# 61666;, Veyx - Pharma GmbH, Schwarzenborn Germany) 10 days before scheduled AI. Prostaglandin F 2 &# 945; (0. 5 mg of cloprostenol, PGF Veyx&# 61666; forte, Veyx - Pharma GmbH, Schwarzenborn, Germany) was administered 7 days later and another 48 hours later cows were re-treated with the GnRH analogue. AI was carried out about 20 hours after the second GnRH treatment. Pregnancy was diagnosed by rectal palpation 42 days post insemination. Endometritis was significantly associated with production level. The proportion of affected animals was higher in cows with low production during the 5 th week post partum (p Production levels were defined during the 5 th week of lactation and were constant throughout the whole lactation. Cows with a low milk level during the 5 th week of lactation, had a low milk level after 305 days in milk. Cows with a high milk level during the 5 th week of lactation, had a high milk level after 305 days in milk. First service conception rates to TAI did not differ between cows of low (34. 5 %), medium (34. 0 %) and high (28. 2 %) milk production levels synchronized {{at the same time in}} the Group 1 &# 65533;Simultaneous Ovsynch&# 65533;. In the Group 2 &# 65533;Production Ovsynch&# 65533;, cows started 3 weeks earlier (low production) than Group 1 had significantly lower first service conception rates to TAI (14. 4 %) and cows synchronized 3 weeks later had significantly higher first service conception rates (41. 4 %) than cows synchronized together with Group 1 (28. 7 %). Low producing cows in Group 1 had significantly higher first service conception rates to TAI than low producing cows in Group 2, that had been synchronized three weeks earlier(34. 5 vs. 14. 4 %). High producing cows in Group 1 had significantly lower first service conception rates than high producing cows in Group 2, that were synchronized 3 weeks later (28. 2 vs. 41. 4 %). Results of this study demonstrate clearly, that stage of lactation has a significant impact on conception rates on TAI in an Ovsynch protocol. On the other hand, production level did not have a significant influence on conception rates. After 200 days in milk in all subgroups the same share of cows were pregnant. That&# 65533;s why the different voluntary waiting periods have had no significant influence on the average days open and of the pregnancy rates by 200 days in milk. The use of the Ovsynch protocol allows an acceptable average time to first artificial insemination. It is not necessary to start very early in lactation with the first artificial insemination. The effect of clinical mastitis of the conception rate after Ovsynch was studied. Cows with a clinical mastitis three weeks before AI and three weeks after AI have had a lower first conception rate after Ovsynch. The number of days to conception for cows with clinical mastitis was seven days greater and they have less milk production. In all different subgroups the costs for each pregnancy was calculated. Dairy cows with the best milk production parameters have had the highest costs per pregnancy. For all production levels it was cost-effective to have more days to first <br /...|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine how opinions of persons from outside the livestock industry on the practice of hot-iron jaw branding are perceived by persons from within the Texas livestock show industry. The key-informant interviews conducted revealed interesting findings. The persons interviewed from within the Texas livestock show industry personally did not feel that there was a problem with the practice of hot-iron jaw branding, but they did feel that persons from outside the livestock industry would obtain a negative image of the livestock industry from hearing about or witnessing the practice. The majority of the respondents felt the time for a change had come. The issues which surfaced during every interview centered on more efficient education and good sound reasons for every practice. From within, the livestock show industry must spot and mark for change or justify areas of potential or emerging concern. If a practice can be justified by persons within the livestock industry, it adds validity to the action. If a practice cannot be justified by persons within the livestock industry, the practice should be discontinued. Modern technology now gives us alternatives to hot-iron jaw branding with different perceptions of pain and effectiveness associated with them. Therefore, there is no longer an excuse for using a practice by reasoning that there are no alternatives. Persons from within the Texas livestock show industry perceive that persons from outside the livestock industry would have a negative experience when exposed to the practice of hot-iron jaw branding. If an individual found the practice negative, it could affect future buying choices and some respondents thought it would trigger the individual to continue to discover negative practices. It behooves the Texas livestock show industry to change from the current method of permanent marking at the livestock shows (hot-iron jaw branding) to a method which would be seen as more acceptable to persons from outside the livestock industry. Alternatives which should be considered by livestock shows in Texas include ear tattooing. hoof branding, electronic identification, non-removable <b>eartags,</b> nose printing, nontamperable neck chains, and no permanent marking...|$|R
40|$|The carob {{plant is}} {{known from the}} ancient years {{in the region of}} Mediterranean, where its fruit {{constituted}} nutritious food for the people and the animals. The present work constitutes study of efficiency of feed utilization for fattening pigs after the addition of carob. With this study an effort was made to determine the main parameters, with which it is possible to utilize the ration for fattening pigs, after adding to it carob produced in Greece. Thus, in relative experimentation with fattening pigs that began with their weaning and finished with their slaughter, we determined the increase of bodily weight, the consumption of food, the feed conversion ratio, the output of pigs in carcass, the quality of carcass (measuring the fat depth, the content of Weende nutritious substances in carcass), the digestibility of Weende nutritious substances in the ration, the quantification of tannins in carobs, the mortality and the consistency of produced excrements of fattening pigs. For the investigation of efficiency of feed utilization of fattening pigs with the addition of carob in their ration, 4 experimental circles were held with the use of 40 piglets per circle. In each experimental circle 40 weaning piglets were selected and after the placement of numbered <b>eartags</b> on them, they were separated in 4 teams A, B, C and D, each one with 10 piglets (5 males and 5 females) and they constituted subgroups A 1, A 2, A 3, A 4, B 1, B 2, B 3, B 4, C 1 C 2, C 3, C 4 and D 1, D 2, D 3, D 4 in the 4 circles of experimentation, respectively.
