He was reunited with Ferrando, who had recently been appointed coach of Atlético.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} of Dreadnought coincided with increasing {{tension between the}} United Kingdom and Germany. Germany had begun to build a large battlefleet in the 1890s, {{as part of a}} deliberate policy to challenge British naval supremacy. With the conclusion of the Entente Cordiale between the United Kingdom and France in April 1904, it became <b>increasingly</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the United Kingdom's principal naval enemy would be Germany, which was building up a large, modern fleet under the 'Tirpitz' laws. This rivalry gave rise to the two largest dreadnought fleets of the pre-war period.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, {{it became}} <b>increasingly</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the SAS-cooperation was weak, and that either a full merger or a {{discontinuation}} of the cooperation would be necessary. Braathen suggested {{to the government}} that DNL, Fred. Olsen Airtransport and Braathens SAFE should merge {{to create a new}} domestic airline, but this proposal was rejected by both DNL and Fred. Olsen. In 1949, the Swedish branch of SAS, Aerotransport (ABA), and the Danish branch, Det Danske Luftfartselskab (DDL) started a joint route to the Far East. For a merger to be completed, Danish and Swedish authorities required that SAS be granted all international routes from Norway, meaning that Braathens SAFE would lose its concession from 1 March 1954. The SAS merger was completed on 8 August 1951.|$|E

5|$|In {{the days}} prior to hitting Dominica, David was {{originally}} expected to hit Barbados and spare Dominica in the process. However, on August 29 a turn in the hours before moving through the area caused the 150 mph (240 km/h) hurricane to make a direct hit on {{the southern part of}} Dominica. Even as it became <b>increasingly</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> David was headed for the island, residents did not appear to take the situation seriously. This can be partly attributed to the fact that local radio warnings were minimal and disaster preparedness schemes were essentially non-existent. Furthermore, Dominica had not experienced a major hurricane since 1930, thus leading to complacency amongst much of the population. This proved to have disastrous consequences for the island nation.|$|E
5|$|Then, in {{the spring}} of 1466, Warwick was sent to the {{continent}} to carry out negotiations with the French and Burgundians. The negotiations centred around a marriage proposal involving Edward's sister Margaret. Warwick increasingly came to favour French diplomatic connections. Meanwhile, Edward's father-in-law, Richard Woodville, Earl Rivers, who had been created treasurer, was in favour of a Burgundian alliance. This set up internal conflict within the English court, which was not alleviated by the fact that Edward had signed a secret treaty in October with Burgundy, while Warwick was forced to carry on sham negotiations with the French. Later, George Neville was dismissed as chancellor, while Edward refused to contemplate a marriage between Warwick's oldest daughter Isabel, and Edward's brother George, Duke of Clarence. It became <b>increasingly</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Warwick's position of dominance at court had been taken over by Rivers.|$|E
5|$|The economic, {{social and}} {{cultural}} dislocation of ordinary people, the economic hardship of an economy in transition, and the pressures of meteorological disasters all contributed to growing problems in Central Europe. The failure {{of most of the}} governments to deal with the food crisis of the mid-1840s, caused by the potato blight (related to the Great Irish Famine) and several seasons of bad weather, encouraged many to think that the rich and powerful had no interest in their problems. Those in authority were concerned about the growing unrest, political and social agitation among the working classes, and the disaffection of the intelligentsia. No amount of censorship, fines, imprisonment, or banishment, it seemed, could stem the criticism. Furthermore, it was becoming <b>increasingly</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> both Austria and Prussia wanted to be the leaders in any resulting unification; each would inhibit the drive of the other to achieve unification.|$|E

5|$|Yet while Solidarity {{was ready}} to take up {{negotiations}} with the government, the Polish communists were unsure what to do, as they issued empty declarations and bided their time. Against the background of a deteriorating communist shortage economy and unwillingness to negotiate seriously with Solidarity, it became <b>increasingly</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the Communist government would eventually have to suppress the Solidarity movement {{as the only way}} out of the impasse, or face a truly revolutionary situation. The atmosphere was increasingly tense, with various local chapters conducting a growing number of uncoordinated strikes as well as street protests, such as the Summer 1981 hunger demonstrations in Poland, in response to the worsening economic situation. On December 3, 1981, Solidarity announced that a 24-hour strike would be held if the government were granted additional powers to suppress dissent, and that a general strike would be declared if those powers were used.|$|E

30|$|In any {{particular}} geographical region, various leptospiral serovars are prevalent and {{are associated with}} one or more maintenance host(s) that serves as reservoir of infection. Leptospira spp. are traditionally classified into 29 serogroups and over 300 serovars (Levett 2001). Further, genotypic methods like DNA-DNA hybridization have identified 20 Leptospira spp. to date (Cerqueira and Picardeau 2009). However, antigenically related serovars are classified in two or more different species and a serogroup is often found in several species of leptospira. Serovar identification of isolates are essential to understand the prevalence of leptospira in the epidemiology of this disease, but few laboratories perform Cross Agglutination Absorption Test (CAAT) (Terpstra et al. 1985) and most isolates are therefore not identified at serovar level. Serogroups identified using the MAT have no official taxonomic status, can serve as practical purpose of grouping common antigens together. With the emergence of molecular typing methods, it has become <b>increasingly</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>that</b> the concept of a “serovar” is no longer fully satisfactory as it may fail to define epidemiologically important strains/isolates in an adequate manner (Cerqueira and Picardeau 2009). For example, molecular typing has been shown to give better discrimination of strains of the Grippotyphosa serogroup than serological typing (Steinen et al. 1992; Hartskeerl et al. 2004).|$|R
40|$|Diabetic {{cardiomyopathy}} {{is defined}} as ventricular dysfunction initiated by alterations in cardiac energy substrates {{in the absence of}} coronary artery disease and hypertension. In addition to the demonstrated burden of cardiovascular events associated with diabetes, diabetic cardiomyopathy partly explains why diabetic patients are subject to a greater risk of heart failure and a worse outcome after myocardial ischemia. The raising prevalence and accumulating costs of cardiovascular disease in diabetic patients underscore the deficiencies of tertiary prevention and call for a shift in medical treatment. It is becoming <b>increasingly</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>that</b> the effective prevention and treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy require measures to regulate the metabolic derangement occurring in the heart rather than merely restoring suitable systemic parameters. Recent research has provided deeper insight into the metabolic etiology of diabetic cardiomyopathy and numerous heart-specific targets that may substitute or reinforce current strategies. From both experimental and translational perspectives, in this review we first discuss the progress made with conventional therapies, and then focus on the need for prospective metabolic targets that may avert myocardial vulnerability and functional decline in next-generation diabetic careThis work was supported by national grants from Ministerio de Educación y Ciencia (SAF 2009 - 08367) and Comunidad de Madrid (CCG 10 -UAM/BIO- 5289) ...|$|R
