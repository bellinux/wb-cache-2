50|$|The {{original}} Pen is a {{very compact}} <b>half-frame</b> <b>camera,</b> with just a viewfinder, no meter and fully manual settings. It has a 28mm f/3.5 Zuiko lens. Its shutter settings are 25, 50, 100, 200, B; its aperture range from 3.5 to 22. The back is removed completely for film loading and unloading.|$|E
50|$|A <b>half-frame</b> <b>camera</b> is {{a camera}} using a film format at half the {{intended}} exposure format. A common variety is the 18&times;24 mm format on regular 135 film. It is the normal exposure format on 35mm movie cameras. For still cameras using the 35mm film, the usual format is 24&times;36 mm, so still cameras taking 18&times;24 mm exposures are called half-frame cameras.|$|E
50|$|The Pen {{series is}} a family of <b>half-frame</b> <b>cameras</b> made by Olympus from 1959 to the {{beginning}} of the 1980s. Aside from the Pen F series of half-frame SLRs, they are fixed-lens viewfinder cameras.|$|R
50|$|Chaika (Чайка) was {{a series}} of Soviet 35mm <b>half-frame</b> <b>cameras</b> {{produced}} by BELOMO from 1965 to 1974. The name came from call sign of the first woman in space - Valentina Tereshkova.Over 2 million Chaika cameras were produced. All models of the Chaika cameras have metal case.|$|R
5000|$|... "Definition of Subminiature—very much {{reduced in}} size", Oxford English Dictionary.Subminiature camera is {{a class of}} camera very much smaller than [...] "miniature camera".The term [...] "miniature camera" [...] was {{originally}} used to describe camera using the 35 mm cine film as negative material for still photography; so cameras that used film smaller than 35mm were referred to as [...] "sub-miniature". The smallest of these are {{often referred to as}} [...] "ultra-miniature". Lipstick cameras and other small digital cameras are not included, because they don't use film. The smaller subminiature or ultraminiature cameras, particularly Minox, are associated with spying. <b>Half-frame</b> <b>cameras</b> belong to the miniature camera category, as these use 35mm film. Some <b>half-frame</b> <b>cameras,</b> such as Olympus Pen F which is approximately 611 grams massive, are even heavier than classical full-frame miniature cameras, taking for example the Leica IIIf which is 428g.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} Pen {{was introduced}} in 1959. It was designed by Yoshihisa Maitani, {{and was the first}} <b>half-frame</b> <b>camera</b> produced in Japan. It was one of the smallest cameras to use 35mm film in regular 135 cassettes. It was thought to be as portable as a pen; thus the name. The idea was to be much copied by other Japanese makers.|$|E
50|$|With a <b>half-frame</b> <b>camera,</b> one can fit {{twice as}} many {{pictures}} onto a standard roll of film. For example, 72 exposures on a 36-exposure roll, 48 on a 24-exposure one, and so on. The exposures have a vertical (portrait) orientation {{as opposed to the}} horizontal (landscape) orientation of a 35mm SLR or rangefinder, {{with the exception of the}} Konica Recorder, whose film mechanism runs vertically.|$|E
5000|$|Images of Florence: Stang's {{photography}} characteristically employs alternative cameras (such as the Olympus Pen-FT <b>half-frame</b> <b>camera,</b> the Kodak Brownie, and the Holga), or alternative formats (such as Polaroid emulsion transfers) and techniques. Her book of Polaroid emulsion transfers, Encountering Florence {{was published}} simultaneously in the U.S. and in Italy (under the title Firenze un Incontro in 2007. Stang's {{use of the}} emulsion transfer process involves transferring the fragile, fabric-like emulsion layer of the photograph (bearing the image) to another surface, subtly transforming the original image {{in a variety of}} ways. The results were described in Photo Review as giving Stang's portraits of Florence's buildings, streets, statuary, and gardens [...] "a delicate, draping quality ... reminiscent of the fabrics draped on the ancient statues within the images". An Italian reviewer observed that the photographic process presents [...] "a city not previously seen and perhaps a little disquieting". The book's bi-lingual text in English and Italian was selected and edited by Stang and by Andrea Burzi and Susanna Sarti, both of Florence, to present accompanying word-portraits from well-known authors in their own encounters with the city. A portfolio of Stang's work for the book is held by the Rare Books Collection of the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale Firenze.|$|E
50|$|The Mercury II, {{produced}} in 1946, also used a rotary shutter. This was a <b>half-frame</b> 35mm <b>camera.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There was a vogue of <b>half-frame</b> <b>cameras</b> in the 1960s, {{mainly from}} Japan, {{originating}} with the Olympus Pen models. It {{allowed for a}} very compact camera, using commonly available film, unlike other subminiatures that used exotic films (16mm, 9.5mm, etc.).This vogue ended when cameras like the Rollei 35 or the Olympus XA showed {{that it was possible}} to make cameras as small as the half-frame ones, but taking 24&times;36 mm exposures.|$|R
50|$|The Olympus PEN F {{series of}} <b>cameras</b> were <b>half-frame</b> SLR <b>cameras</b> {{produced}} between 1963 and 1970. The cameras were unique in using a rotary shutter.|$|R
50|$|The Minigraph, by Levy-Roth of Berlin, another <b>half-frame</b> small <b>camera</b> {{was sold}} in Germany in 1915. The patent for the Debrie Sept camera, a {{combination}} 35 mm still and movie camera was issued in 1918; the camera sold from 1922.|$|R
50|$|At first, BelOMO made {{photographic}} equipment and lens-making machinery for state use. It now manufactures {{a wide range}} of products, including military and consumer optical products. During the 1980s it produced the Agat-18 and Agat-18K <b>half-frame</b> 35mm <b>cameras,</b> still popular among Lomographic photographers.|$|R
50|$|The design {{echoes the}} 1963 Olympus Pen F <b>half-frame</b> SLR film <b>camera,</b> {{especially}} in the silver top and the chunky front dial, {{a nod to the}} shutter speed dial on the film camera.|$|R
50|$|The Olympus Pen F {{series was}} {{introduced}} and produced by Olympus of Japan between 1963 and 1966. The System {{consisted of the}} original Olympus Pen F, later the behind-the-lens metering Pen FT, 1966-1972; and the non-metered version of the FT, known as the Olympus Pen FV, which was manufactured from 1967 to 1970. The design considerations used were unusual. The <b>camera</b> produced a <b>half-frame</b> 35 mm negative; it used a Porro prism as a design-replacement for the conventional pentaprism thus producing the 'flat top' appearance; and the view through the viewfinder was of 'portrait' orientation' (unlike standard 35mm SLRs which had 'landscape' orientation). These <b>half-frame</b> <b>cameras</b> were also exceptional in that all used a rotary shutter, rather than the traditional horizontally travelling focal-plane shutter commonly used in other SLR camera designs. The camera was produced with various interchangeable lenses. The smaller image format made the Pen F system {{one of the smallest}} SLR camera systems ever made. Only the Pentax Auto 110 was smaller, but the Pentax system was of much more limited range in terms of lenses and accessories.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} designs of the seventies for the 35mm SLR camera industry was the introduction of the Olympus OM-1 in 1973. After experiencing success with their small Olympus Pen <b>half-frame</b> <b>cameras,</b> particularly with their half-frame SLR-based Olympus Pen-F, Pen-Ft and Pen-FV cameras, Olympus set out with its chief designer Yoshihisa Maitani to later create a compact SLR—the M-1—with new compact lenses and a large bayonet mount that could accept almost any SLR design optic. Shortly after being launched the camera was renamed the OM-1 to avoid a trademark conflict with Leica. The mechanical, manual OM-1 was significantly smaller and lighter than contemporary SLRs, but no less functional. The camera was supported by one {{of the most}} comprehensive 35mm SLR lens and accessory systems available. Maitani decreased the size and weight by totally redesigning the SLR from the ground up with unprecedented use of metallurgy, which included repositioning the shutter speed selector {{to the front of the}} lens mount, instead of a more conventional position on top of the body.|$|R
25|$|Ducati Meccanica (as {{the company}} was {{previously}} known) has its marque on non-motorcycle products as well. In the 1930s and 1940s, Ducati manufactured radios, cameras, and electrical products such as a razor. Ducati made a marine binocular called the BIMAR for the Kriegsmarine during World War II, {{some of which were}} sold on the civilian market after the war. The Ducati Sogno was a <b>half-frame</b> Leica-like <b>camera</b> which is now a collector's item. Ducati and Bianchi have developed and launched a new line of racing bicycles.|$|R
5000|$|While {{the vast}} {{majority}} of rotary shutters are naturally used on motion-picture cameras (as well as projectors), there were some still cameras that employed this type of shutter, notably the Univex Mercury rangefinder and the Olympus Pen F SLR. Both of these <b>cameras</b> were <b>half-frame</b> 35mm <b>cameras</b> (frame size 18 x 24 mm). The rotary shutter proved to be very simple to construct, accurate and reliable in these cameras. Though, {{in the case of the}} Univex, it resulted in a very strange [...] "hump" [...] on top of the camera to cover the shutter disc.|$|R
50|$|One {{of the few}} cameras ever {{produced}} for left-handers was the <b>half-frame</b> Yashica Samurai. <b>Cameras</b> predominantly have the hand grip, shutter release, film wind lever and commonly used selection buttons, switches and dials controlled by the right hand. Lens controls (where present) tend to be accessible by either hand. When an unskilled left-handed person uses a right-handed camera the hand control can be less steady and hence produce camera shake leading to poorer pictures at low shutter speeds.|$|R
50|$|First {{making an}} {{appearance}} in the late 19th century, often as concealed cameras, subminiature cameras became popular soon after WWII when many consumer markets required small, inexpensive cameras. Friedrich Kaftansky's Mini-flex was designed in 1931, {{on the market in}} 1933. Walter Zapp's Riga Minox appeared in 1938. Kodak's introduction of the 110 camera in the 1970s and the Kodak disc camera in the 1980s brought the subminiature camera to the forefront of the photographic market. The many cheap, poorly made cameras that soon appeared drove Kodak out of the market.Various formats of subminiature camera have come and gone over the years as newer formats have replaced older one. In addition, many larger format cameras, especially 35 mm, become smaller in size and weight—partly due to the consumer demand for subminiature cameras—and were able to replace some subminiature formats. For example, full-frame 35 mm cameras, such as the Minox 35 and the Olympus XA, were made as small as earlier <b>half-frame</b> subminiature <b>cameras</b> such as the Olympus Pen, using moderate wide-angle fixed lenses to minimise lens barrel depth. Some subminiature formats, such as the Minox and 110 formats, continue in production. Most other subminiature cameras are still usable if film can be obtained, particularly if the photographer is prepared to do the processing.|$|R
