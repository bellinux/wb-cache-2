The Bishop of Angouleme died in June, after attending the council. The Archbishop of Trier, Albero de Montreuil, was so <b>ill</b> he was carried to the council on a horse litter.|$|E

Her little brother died shortly thereafter.|$|E

In this paper, {{we describe}} analysis results of <b>ILLs</b> in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and English (CJKE) Wikipedias, and propose a cross-lingual keyword navigation system using <b>ILLs.</b> From analysis of <b>ILLs,</b> we found five patterns of <b>ILLs.</b> An overview of analysis results and the system are described. ...|$|R
40|$|Unlike T cells {{restricted}} by {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) class Ia or class II molecules, T cells {{restricted by}} MHC class I–like molecules demonstrate properties of both innate and adaptive immunity and are therefore considered innate-like lymphocytes (<b>ILLs).</b> <b>ILLs</b> {{are believed to have}} immunoregulatory functions, but their roles in autoimmunity and defense against infections remain elusive. To study the properties of <b>ILLs,</b> we generated mice expressing only MHC class I–like molecules by crossing CIITA−/− with Kb−/−Db−/− mice. Surprisingly, these mice developed a lymphoproliferative syndrome and autoimmunity, most notably inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and insulitis. The CD 8 + <b>ILLs</b> in these mice exhibit a constitutively activated phenotype, and depletion of these cells abolished the autoimmune disorders. In addition, adoptive transfer of CD 8 + <b>ILLs</b> from Kb−/−Db−/−CIITA−/− mice to Rag- 1 −/−pfn−/− mice also resulted in IBD and insulitis. These findings provide direct evidence that CD 8 + <b>ILLs</b> are sufficient to initiate and mediate autoimmune diseases...|$|R

50|$|A few {{examples}} of this subject arise in the play. One is Claire's prostiution, another is <b>Ill's</b> worth of a billion dollars. In Claire's case, Dürrnmatt pokes {{at the idea of}} selling one's body. He describes the prostitution as almost the same as labor jobs. He asks if {{there is a difference between}} those two occupations in terms of giving your body away for money. Alfred <b>Ill's</b> situation brings up another subject with the same kind of subject. <b>Ill's</b> body is priced at a billion dollars. This suggests that his body can be bought, sold, and consumed just like things in the economy. <b>Ill's</b> body is made into an object once Claire puts a price on him.|$|R

5|$|This {{increased}} severity {{has been}} attributed to the circumstances of the First World War. In civilian life, natural selection favours a mild strain. Those who get very <b>ill</b> stay home, and those mildly <b>ill</b> continue with their lives, preferentially spreading the mild strain. In the trenches, natural selection was reversed. Soldiers with a mild strain stayed where they were, while the severely <b>ill</b> were sent on crowded trains to crowded field hospitals, spreading the deadlier virus. The second wave began and the flu quickly spread around the world again. Consequently, during modern pandemics health officials pay attention when the virus reaches places with social upheaval (looking for deadlier strains of the virus).|$|E
