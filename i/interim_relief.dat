40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} a multilateral debt relief program on child health. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank launched the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative in the late 1990 s to reduce the debt burdens of poor countries, and explicitly linked the initiative to the aim of poverty reduction and social targets. As a result, debt-servicing costs have gone down by an average 1. 8 percentage points of gross domestic product in Heavily Indebted Poor Countries. However, the social effects of debt relief are not well known. The paper employs micro data on infant mortality from 56 country-specific Demographic and Health Surveys to investigate the effects of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative on child health. The retrospective fertility structure of the data allows for analysis using the within-mother variation in the probability of survival of babies before and after different stages of the initiative. The results suggest that after a debt-ridden country enters the program, which is conditional on reform and pro-development policies, and receives <b>interim</b> debt <b>relief,</b> the probability of infant mortality goes down by about 0. 5 percentage point. This translates into about 3, 000 fewer infant deaths in an average Heavily Indebted Poor Country. The findings are particularly strong for infants born to poor mothers and mothers living in rural areas, and are driven by access to vaccines early in life and during pregnancy. There are no child health effects from graduating from the program and receiving full debt relief...|$|R

Italy and Greece were obviously different with regard to population and market size, but the outcome of the foreign aid they received, differed in the two countries. This paper suggests that the different outcome is explained by historical legacies and conjunctures, as well as series of institutional, cultural, and political factors. Greece underwent a disastrous Nazi occupation (1941 - 44) and the destructive Civil War (1946 - 49) of which Italy was spared. The Italian public sector was endowed with state agencies steering economic development, which the Greek public sector lacked until the early 1950 s. Italian elections resulted in more stable governments, led by the Christian Democratic Party, which followed their own policy choices, often deviating from the donors' policy preference. This was a pattern absent from the long sequence of unstable and internally fragmented Greek governments. The Italian governing elites relied on a social alliance of middle and upper classes, while in Greece the corresponding classes distrusted the government, and resisted government policies. Finally, an economic culture fostering heavy industrialization, in the context of pragmatist liberal economic policies, was present in Italy, but absent in Greece...|$|R
40|$|The {{standard}} for granting preliminary injunctions {{in some states}} {{is not the same}} as the preliminary injunction standard that is followed in the federal district courts in the federal circuit where the state is located. For example, the interlocutory injunction standard in Georgia’s superior courts is not as demanding as the preliminary injunction standard in Georgia’s federal courts. Although state and federal courts in Georgia consider four similar factors in deciding whether to grant or deny provisional injunctive relief, a balancing or sliding scale approach can be used in Georgia’s courts; the moving party need not prove all four of the factors. In contrast, the Eleventh Circuit insists that the plaintiff must clearly establish the burden of persuasion on each of the four elements. This difference between the preliminary injunction standards followed in a state’s courts and the federal courts in that state implicates the principles announced in Erie Railroad Company v. Tompkins and that venerable decision’s progeny. Specifically, should a federal district court in Georgia apply the Eleventh Circuit’s standard in a diversity case or does the Erie doctrine require it to apply Georgia’s {{standard for}} interlocutory injunctions. It is reasonable to assume that a plaintiff seeking to enjoin particular conduct by a diverse defendant would prefer the Georgia standard and forum shop by filing his or her claim in a Georgia superior court, and that the diverse defendant would, in turn, remove the case to federal district court if possible. Also, it is conceivable, given the discrepancy between the standards, that there could be a difference in outcome on the grant or denial of provisional injunctive relief depending on which standard is applied, with the plaintiff favoring Georgia’s interlocutory injunction standard because it is not as demanding as the Eleventh Circuit’s standard. Notwithstanding the possibility of forum shopping and different outcomes on the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction, this article concludes that a federal district court should apply its circuit’s standard, not the forum state’s standard. This conclusion is not justified by saying Federal Rule 65 (a) is on point and controls, or because the choice of the appropriate standard is simply a matter of procedure. Rather, it is justified by analyzing and weighing the several factors that were announced by the U. S. Supreme Court in Hanna v. Plumer and Byrd v. Blue Ridge Electric Cooperative for the typical unguided Erie choice. Of the these factors the most important are that the differences between the standards do not cause litigant inequality, that the forum state’s and the federal circuit’s interests in the grant or denial of equitable relief are not at odds but congruent, and that the grant or denial of this <b>interim</b> equitable <b>relief</b> is provisional and not a final adjudication on the merits of the plaintiff’s claim. Moreover, given the similarity of the four criteria weighed by the respective courts, there is a good chance that the state court and a federal district court in the forum state would, on the same set of facts, enter substantially similar orders on a plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction...|$|R
