40|$|Noise <b>exposure-response</b> <b>relationships</b> {{are used}} to {{estimate}} the effects of noise on individuals or a population. Such relationships may be derived from independent or repeated binary observations, and modeled by different statistical methods. Depending on the method by which they were established, their application in population risk assessment or estimation of individual responses may yield different results, i. e., predict “weaker” or “stronger” effects. As far as the present body of literature on noise effect studies is concerned, however, the underlying statistical methodology to establish <b>exposure-response</b> <b>relationships</b> {{has not always been}} paid sufficient attention. This paper gives an overview on two statistical approaches (subject-specific and population-averaged logistic regression analysis) to establish noise <b>exposure-response</b> <b>relationships</b> from repeated binary observations, and their appropriate applications. The considerations are illustrated with data from three noise effect studies, estimating also the magnitude of differences in results when applying <b>exposure-response</b> <b>relationships</b> derived from the two statistical approaches. Depending on the underlying data set and the probability range of the binary variable it covers, the two approaches yield similar to very different results. The adequate choice of a specific statistical approach and its application in subsequent studies, both depending on the research question, are therefore crucial...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the ongoing research project described in this paper was to study the potential for reducing energy used for ventilating buildings by using low-polluting building materials, without compromising the indoor air quality. To quantify this potential, the <b>exposure-response</b> <b>relationships,</b> i. e. the relationships between ventilation rate and perceived indoor air quality, were established for rooms furnished with different categories of polluting materials and the simulations of energy used for ventilation were carried out. The <b>exposure-response</b> <b>relationships</b> {{were based on a}} summary of data reported in the literature on <b>exposure-response</b> <b>relationships</b> for materials tested in laboratory settings in small-scale glass chambers, and in full-scale in climate chambers, test rooms or normal offices. New experiments were also considered in which the effect of using low-polluting materials on perceived air quality was examined in test rooms ventilated with different outdoor air supply rates, low-polluting materials being selected in small glass chambers. The results suggest that the <b>exposure-response</b> <b>relationships</b> vary between different building materials and that the perceived air quality can be improved considerably when polluting building materials are substituted with materials that pollute less. The preliminary energy simulations indicate that selecting low-polluting materials will result in considerable energy savings as a result of reducing the ventilation rates required to achieve acceptable indoor air quality...|$|R

This study {{is an extension of}} an earlier European meta-analysis. Our aim was to explore <b>exposure-response</b> <b>relationship</b> between PCB- 153 and p-p'-DDE and birth outcomes; to evaluate whether any no exposure-effect level and susceptible subgroups exist; and to assess the role of maternal gestational weight gain (GWG). We used a pooled dataset of 9377 mother-child pairs enrolled in 14 study populations from 11 European birth cohorts. General additive models were used to evaluate the shape of the relationships between organochlorine compounds and birth outcomes. We observed an inverse linear <b>exposure-response</b> <b>relationship</b> between prenatal {{exposure to}} PCB- 153 and birth weight [decline of 194 g (95 % CI - 314, - 74) per 1 μg/L increase in PCB- 153]. We showed effects on birth weight over the entire exposure range, including at low levels. This reduction seems to be stronger among children of mothers who were non-Caucasian or had smoked during pregnancy. The most susceptible subgroup was girls whose mothers smoked during pregnancy. After adjusting for absolute GWG or estimated fat mass, a reduction in birth weight was still observed. This study suggests that the association between low-level exposure to PCB- 153 and birth weight exists and follows an inverse linear <b>exposure-response</b> <b>relationship</b> with effects even at low levels, and that maternal smoking and ethnicity modify this association...|$|E

40|$|<b>Exposure-response</b> <b>relationships</b> are {{important}} tools for policy makers {{to assess the}} impact of an environmental stressor on the populace. Their validity lies partly in their statistical strength which is greatly influenced by the size of the sample from which the relationship is derived. As such, the derivation of meaningful <b>exposure-response</b> <b>relationships</b> requires estimates of vibration exposure at a large number of receiver locations. In the United Kingdom a socio-vibrational survey has been conducted with the aim of deriving <b>exposure-response</b> <b>relationships</b> for annoyance due to vibration from (a) railway traffic and (b) the construction of a new light rail system. Response to vibration was measured via a questionnaire conducted face-to-face with residents in their own homes and vibration exposure was estimated using data from a novel measurement methodology. In total, 1281 questionnaires were conducted: 931 for vibration from railway traffic and 350 for vibration from construction sources. Considering the interdisciplinary nature of this work along with the volume of experimental data required, a number of significant technical and logistical challenges needed to be overcome through the planning and implementation of the fieldwork. Four of these challenges are considered in this paper: the site identification for providing a robust sample of the residents affected, the strategies used for measuring both exposure and response and the coordination between the teams carrying out the social survey and the vibration measurements...|$|R

There are only few studies, however, that have evaluated {{the form of the}} <b>exposure-response</b> <b>relationship</b> and the role of individual effect modifiers. We studied the <b>exposure-response</b> <b>relationship</b> between daily PM 10 and respiratory mortality in Italy, and considered the potential effect modifiers. Methods: A case-crossover analysis was carried out in 35 + year old residents in 10 Italian cities who died from respiratory causes (ICD- 9 codes 460 - 519) in 2001 - 2005. Daily data of PM 10, NO 2 and O 3 were obtained for the same period. Individual information on sociodemographic characteristics and chronic conditions from previous hospital admissions were collected. A conditional logistic regression analysis was carried out in each city and the pooled association was estimated in a random-effect meta-analysis. The <b>exposure-response</b> <b>relationship</b> was explored using a meta-smoothing approach. Results: There were 19, 629 respiratory deaths (7. 1 % of natural causes). The risk of dying for respiratory causes increased by 2. 29 % (95 % Confidence Intervals, CI, 1. 03 - 3. 58) for 10 mg/m 3 increase of PM 10 (lag 0 - 3). The strongest associations were observed for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (2. 79 %) and pneumonia (2. 30 %) both at lag 0 - 5. There was no evidence of a threshold in the exposure-response curve and the relationship appeared to be linear. The PM 10 effect was not confounded by co-pollutants (NO 2 or O 3). No statistically significant effect modifiers were detected although very elderly (85 + years), females and subjects with a chronic disease had the strongest effect.

Objective: We sought to identify research priorities for exposure assessment that will more accurately and precisely define <b>exposure–response</b> <b>relationships</b> of household air pollution necessary to inform future cleaner-burning cookstove dissemination programs. Data Sources: As part of an international workshop in May 2011, an expert group characterized the state of the science and developed recommendations for exposure assessment of household air pollution. Synthesis: The following priority research areas were identified to explain variability and reduce uncertainty of household air pollution exposure measurements: improved characterization of spatial and temporal variability for studies examining both short- and long-term health effects; development and validation of measurement technology and approaches to conduct complex exposure assessments in resource-limited settings with a large range of pollutant concentrations; and development and validation of biomarkers for estimating dose. Addressing these priority research areas, which will inherently require an increased allocation of resources for cookstove research, will lead to better characterization of <b>exposure–response</b> <b>relationships.</b> Conclusions: Although the type and extent of exposure assessment will necessarily depend on the goal and design of the cookstove study, without improved understanding of <b>exposure–response</b> <b>relationships,</b> the level of air pollution reduction necessary to meet the health targets of cookstove interventions will remain uncertain...|$|R
