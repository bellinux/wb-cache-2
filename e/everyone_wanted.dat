Produced in Las Vegas, Nevada, these cars retain the general style and appearance of their original 1960s ancestors, but are fitted with modern amenities. Initially the car <b>everyone</b> <b>wanted</b> in a Continuation was a 427 S/C model which was represented in the CSX4000 series. This was meant to continue where the last 427 S/C production left off, at approximately serial number CSX3660 in the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|That {{evening he}} played {{what he had}} written so far to {{a small group of}} Leningrad musicians. After Shostakovich {{finished}} the first movement, there was a long silence. An air-raid warning sounded. No one moved. <b>Everyone</b> <b>wanted</b> to hear the piece again. The composer excused himself to take his family to the nearest air-raid shelter. When he returned, he repeated the first movement, which then was followed by the next movement for his guests. Their reaction encouraged him to start that night on the Adagio. He completed this movement on 29 September in the city. Shostakovich and his family were then evacuated to Moscow on 1 October 1941. They moved to Kuybyshev (now Samara) on 22 October, where the symphony was finally completed.|$|E

25|$|Regarding the American Treaty, the key episodes came in September, 1782, when French Foreign Minister Vergennes {{proposed}} {{a solution that}} was strongly opposed by his ally, the United States. France was exhausted by the war, and <b>everyone</b> <b>wanted</b> peace except for Spain, which insisted on continuing the war until it could capture Gibraltar from the British. Vergennes {{came up with the}} deal that Spain would accept instead of Gibraltar. The United States would gain its independence but be confined to the area east of the Appalachian Mountains. Britain would take the area north of the Ohio River. In the area south of that would be set up an independent Indian state under Spanish control. It would be an Indian barrier state.|$|E
25|$|The new empire was characterised {{by a great}} {{enthusiasm and}} vigor. There was a rash of heroic artwork in {{imitation}} of Greek and Roman styles, and the nation possessed a vigorous, growing industrial economy, while {{it had always been}} rather poor in the past. The change from the slower, more tranquil order of the old Germany was very sudden, and many, especially the nobility, resented being displaced by the new rich. And yet, the nobles clung stubbornly to power, and they, not the bourgeois, continued to be the model that <b>everyone</b> <b>wanted</b> to imitate. In imperial Germany, possessing a collection of medals or wearing a uniform was valued more than the size of one's bank account, and Berlin never became a great cultural center as London, Paris, or Vienna were. The empire was distinctly authoritarian in tone, as the 1871 constitution gave the emperor exclusive power to appoint or dismiss the chancellor. He also was supreme commander-in-chief of the armed forces and final arbiter of foreign policy. But freedom of speech, association, and religion were nonetheless guaranteed by the constitution.|$|E

The choreography was done by Danielle Polanco and Jonte' Moaning, who used a 1980s retro set. Beyoncé explained the concept of the video at MTV: [...] "It's probably the most flamboyant video, and the metallic dresses are so beautiful, they added so much color. I had to do a video for this song. <b>Everyone</b> <b>wanted</b> to know what a 'freakum dress' was, and you can't really explain it, you have to see it.

500|$|Scott and Zelda {{quickly became}} celebrities of New York, {{as much for}} their wild {{behavior}} as {{for the success of}} This Side of Paradise. They were ordered to leave both the Biltmore Hotel and the Commodore Hotel for their drunkenness. Zelda once jumped into the fountain at Union Square. Another example of their behavior was when Dorothy Parker first met them, as Zelda and Scott were sitting atop a taxi. Parker said, [...] "They did both look as though they had just stepped out of the sun; their youth was striking. <b>Everyone</b> <b>wanted</b> to meet him." [...] Their social life was fueled with alcohol. Publicly, this meant little more than napping when they arrived at parties, but privately it increasingly led to bitter fights. To their delight, {{in the pages of the}} New York newspapers Zelda and Scott had become icons of youth and success—enfants terribles of the Jazz Age.|$|E
500|$|Evans enjoyed an {{executive}} position at Apple until 1969, when Allen Klein {{was hired as}} a manager to reorganise the whole company. Evans was fired by Klein the next year, because Klein complained to Lennon that Aspinall and Evans were [...] "living like kings; like fucking emperors". Evans was later reinstated after McCartney, Harrison and Starr complained. On 13 September 1969, Evans accompanied Lennon, Yoko Ono, Klaus Voorman, Alan White and Eric Clapton to Toronto, Canada, for the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival concert. He later wrote: [...] "I was really enjoying myself. It was the first show I had roadied for three years and I was really loving every minute of plugging the amps in and setting them up on stage, making sure that everything was right. <b>Everyone</b> <b>wanted</b> the show to go particularly well because Allen Klein, who had flown over, had organised for the whole of John's performance to be filmed.

[...] Paul Flynn from The Guardian said that Ivan was a [...] "hot bisexual" [...] and felt that his storyline with Paul and Nicola was [...] "played without resorting to cheap laughter". Terry Ramsey of the Evening Standard questioned why Ivan even returned to the village after his break. The writer concluded that it was because [...] "Emmerdale is probably the only bisexual-friendly village in Yorkshire". Upon learning that Brocklebank was leaving the series, the Daily Mail's Carrie Fitton said that as [...] "the only bisexual binman in the village he had staying power".|$|E

[...] NME ranked [...] "Bound 2" [...] at number 22 on their list of the 50 best songs of 2013; [...] "in Kanye's mind this is what constituted a pop song: sped up '70s soul samples, a totally unconventional structure and lyrical gems." [...] Pitchfork Media positioned [...] "Bound 2" [...] at number 40 on their list of the top 100 tracks of 2013.

500|$|Sweet began {{distancing}} {{himself from}} {{other people in the}} Athens music scene and in 1984 quit Oh-OK; by 1985, the Buzz of Delight had broken up. That year, Sweet got a record deal with CBS Records and moved to New York City. He was accused of being opportunistic and using his Athens connections to get a record deal and leave. Sweet maintains that when he went to CBS, he never claimed {{to have anything to do}} with Athens, so that nobody could say he used the town. He says that after months of living in Athens, he realized things weren't as happy there as everyone pretended, and that there was backstabbing going on. In 1993, he said, [...] "Things really turned dark there when R.E.M. got famous, because <b>everyone</b> <b>wanted</b> that fame so bad. Maybe I wanted it too, but I had this musical goal all of my own and wasn't going to go along with the way it was done there." [...] Everybody was telling him that he should be touring and building up a following before doing his record, like R.E.M. had done. However, more than making the record itself and becoming a rock star, Sweet's main motivation was to get money to buy studio gear.|$|E

500|$|Executive {{producer}} Maurice Hurley {{was pleased}} with the outcome of the episode, saying [...] "The sets, the design of it and the look of that show was brilliant, I thought {{that might have been the}} best-looking show of the first season". However, he felt that the characterisations weren't quite right. This was the same opinion as that put forward by actor Brent Spiner, who portrayed both Data and Lore, who thought that Data's actions were not in line with his expectations of the character. This episode was the second and last appearance of Biff Yeager as Chief Engineer Argyle. He was the only one of the Chief Engineers introduced during the first season to appear twice, with Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) gaining the role in season two. Wil Wheaton later recalled that the stand-in actor used in this episode really irritated Spiner, and was never used again. He described the stand-in as looking like [...] "a break dancer doing the Robot" [...] whenever he had to portray Data or Lore, and said that [...] "I think the guy was really into playing an android, and his enthusiasm got cranked up to eleven, but by the end of the week, pretty much <b>everyone</b> <b>wanted</b> to deactivate him and sell him to the nearest Jawa." [...] The events of the episode would be followed up in later seasons, with the crystalline entity returning in the fifth-season episode [...] "Silicon Avatar".

500|$|Alan Simpson, the co-writer of Hancock, enjoyed {{writing for}} Jacques, {{and thought that}} she was [...] "almost like a fella in terms of playing comedy; you didn't write for her {{thinking}} she's a woman so we've got to write the feminine point of view. That made it easier for us". Neville Phillips thought she was a [...] "complete revelation", adding [...] "although she was a large lady (very large, in fact), her movements were dainty, light and graceful, and she had a way of playing comedy that put me in mind of the great Beatrice Lillie... a subtle, sophisticated actress". Her friend Bob Monkhouse thought that her career was overshadowed by her size: [...] "She was such a great comedienne... <b>everyone</b> <b>wanted</b> her but the movers and shakers of entertainment didn't perceive her as anything other than a fat lady". Guy Pearce, writing in the Daily Express, noted that [...] "she always chose to play women in funny situations, rather than refer directly to her weight. She concentrated on the script and its interpretation instead of winning easy laughs by playing 'the fattie'." [...] The approach of writers differed in how they dealt with the characters they asked Jacques to portray. Morwenna Banks and Amanda Swift consider Jacques to have been [...] "unimaginatively cast as the 'fat person'" [...] in ITMA, while in Sykes, her weight was rarely referred to—and Jacques said that Sykes [...] "hardly ever made jokes about my size which was a refreshing change". Gray considers that [...] "although often cast in broad comedy, she never played it broadly, but with an elegance of voice and body that belied all the clichés about women and weight".|$|E
500|$|In June 2009, co-writer and {{producer}} of the song, Xavier [...] "Zaytoven" [...] Dotson revealed to MTV News that he worked with Usher on a song. Zaytoven divulged a few details, saying, [...] "I can't wait for {{something like that to}} come out, so people can see I do more than just hip-hop. I can do R, pop, gospel ... whatever genre of music that's out. If you listen to , you can't say, 'Zaytoven did that.'" [...] According to Zaytoven in another interview with MTV News, the track was originally called [...] "Filing Papers". Zaytoven said, [...] "This is before there were any reports about Usher's marriage in the news. So I was thinking to myself, 'Is he trying to say something?' I don't know what Usher is going through, but Sean Garrett made a song about filling out papers, divorce papers. The beat, it's got a bounce to it. It's outta here." [...] Sean Garrett later clarified, stating that the song was not necessarily called [...] "Filing Papers", Garret commented, [...] "Let's say I wrote a record for Usher three or four months ago where I really didn't have any idea of what he was going through personally. I work really hard at creating records I feel that's gonna fit like a glove to an artist. Me and Usher have a close relationship; I tend to sort of assist certain artists in giving them a direction, where I think they need to go in their next move. I felt that was the direction we needed to go. I felt that was the question <b>everyone</b> <b>wanted</b> to know: Was [...] good or was it bad? Was it right? Are you happy or you're not?" [...] Garrett continued to maintain that he had no idea of Usher's state of marriage {{during the time of the}} song's development, stating that the record could have meant anything, saying, [...] "I'm a heavy believer in God. I'm a Pisces. My intuition is crazy. I think that's healthy in the process for me writing and producing for people. Maybe it was a sign of what my man was going through and he needed to get out. Maybe it was something she needed to hear as a wake-up call to her." ...|$|E

2500|$|Over the years, as jazz music {{developed}} and grew in complexity, scat singing did as well. During the bop era, more highly developed vocal improvisation surged in popularity. Annie Ross, a bop singer, expressed a common sentiment among vocalists at the time: [...] "The [...] music was so exciting, <b>everyone</b> <b>wanted</b> to do it." [...] And many did: Ella Fitzgerald, Eddie Jefferson, Betty Carter, Anita O'Day, Joe Carroll, Sarah Vaughan, Carmen McRae, Jon Hendricks, Babs Gonzales, and Dizzy Gillespie were all singers in the idiom.
