In this paper we analyze the impact of the transponder delay, $i. e. $ the processing time between reception and re-emission of a two-way tracking link at the satellite, on tracking observables and on spacecraft orbits. We show that this term, only partially accounted for in the standard formulation of computed space observables, can actually be relevant for future missions with high nominal tracking accuracies or for the re-processing of old missions. We present several applications of our formulation to Earth flybys, the NASA GRAIL and the ESA BepiColombo missions. Comment: 19 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables.

Assumptions and a scenario are presented leading to the water surplus and the revolutionary surface element options for improving the lunar exploration architecture and mission objectives. For example, some of the elements that can benefit from a water surplus are: the power system energy storage can minimize the use of battery systems by replacing batteries with higher energy density fuel cell systems; battery packs on logistics pallets can also be minimized; mobility asset power system mass can be reduced enabling more consumables and extended roving duration and distance; small robotic vehicles (hoppers) can be used to increase the science <b>exploration</b> <b>range</b> by sending round-trip robotic missions to anywhere on the Moon using in-situ produced propellants...|$|E

With their participation, automobile safety has been further enhanced, autonomous driving has become realizable. Time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) technique utilizing {{complementary metal-oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) single photon detectors (SPDs) and time-to-digital converters (TDCs) embodies the proper participant of automotive 3 D vision, with low power consumption, low cost, high speed, high robustness, small size, and portability. In this thesis, a TCSPC 3 D range detector for automotive application was studied and modeled. The model covered all main components of a TCSPC system, including the TCSPC range detection process, the signal, and the noise. It was designed to predict the behavior of TCSPC systems and help future designers optimize the performance {{in accordance with the}} targeted application. To verify the model, a experimental setup was designed, implemented, and characterized. The setup consists of a data acquisition system, data processing procedures, and an optical-mechanical system.

40|$|Traditional {{concepts}} of lunar bases describe scenarios where {{components of the}} bases are landed on the lunar surface, one at a time, and then put {{together to form a}} complete stationary lunar habitat. Recently, some concepts have described the advantages of operating a mobile or 'roving' lunar base. Such a base vastly improves the <b>exploration</b> <b>range</b> from a primary lunar base. Roving bases would also allow the crew to first deploy, test, operationally certify, and then regularly maintain, service, and evolve long life-cycle facilities like observatories or other science payload platforms that are operated far apart from each other across the extraterrestrial surface. The Nomad Explorer is such a mobile lunar base. This paper describes the architectural program of the Nomad Explorer, its advantages over a stationary lunar base, and some of the embedded system concepts which help the roving base to speedily establish a global extraterrestrial infrastructure. A number of modular autonomous logistics landers will carry deployable or erectable payloads, service, and logistically resupply the Nomad Explorer at regular intercepts along the traverse. Starting with the deployment of science experiments and telecommunication networks, and the manned emplacement of a variety of remote outposts using a unique EVA Bell system that enhances manned EVA, the Nomad Explorer architecture suggests the capability for a rapid global development of the extraterrestrial body. The Moon and Mars are candidates for this 'mission oriented' strategy. The lunar case is emphasized in this paper...|$|E
40|$|International audienceArticulatory {{exploration}} {{enables the}} infant to discover {{abilities of the}} vocal tract and learn relationships between movements and percepts. However, neither direct measurements nor transcription methods have access to tongue configurations in pre-linguistic infant vocalizations. A statistical articulatory-acoustic model integrating the non-linear growth of the human vocal tract was used to describe infant behavior before and {{at the beginning of}} canonical babbling. Analyses were developed to assess from a set of (F 1, F 2) formant frequencies reported at 4 and 7 months in two separate corpora the most likely articulatory degrees of freedom of the model. Results indicate that exploration in the 4 -month corpus is centered around a neutral configuration. It involves at least three articulatory parameters, including at least one for the tongue. The jaw seems to play a minor role in this exploration. In contrast, in the 7 -month corpus, the <b>exploration</b> <b>range</b> increases: in this case the jaw plays a dominant role, leading to a large exploitation of the open-close contrast and associated F 1 diversification in formant space. The simulation of co-occurrences between closants and vocants from the 7 - month corpus in the framework of the Frame-Content theory provides a portrait largely consistent with previously reported experimental data. Locus scatter-plots were also simulated and compared to available data on development of coarticulation in CV syllables.

40|$|Precise {{microwave}} {{tracking of}} interplanetary spacecraft {{has been a}} crucial tool in solar system <b>exploration.</b> <b>Range</b> and range rate measurements, the main observable quantities in spacecraft orbit determination and navigation, {{have been widely used}} to refine the dynamical model of the solar system and to probe planetary interiors. Thanks to the use of Ka-band and multifrequency radio links, a significant improvement in microwave tracking systems has been demonstrated by the radio science experiments of the Cassini mission to Saturn. The Cassini radio system has been used to carry out the most accurate test of general relativity to date. Further developments in the radio instrumentation have been recently started for the Mercury Orbiter Radio Experiment (MORE), selected for the ESA mission to Mercury, BepiColombo. MORE addresses the mission's scientific goals in geodesy, geophysics and fundamental physics. In addition, MORE will carry out a navigation experiment, aiming to a precise assessment of the orbit determination accuracies attainable {{with the use of the}} novel instrumentation. The key instrument is a Ka/Ka band digital transponder enabling a high phase coherence between uplink and downlink carriers and supporting a wideband ranging tone. The onboard instrumentation is complemented by a ground system based upon the simultaneous transmission and reception of multiple frequencies at X- and Ka-band. The new wideband ranging system is designed for an end-to-end accuracy of 20 cm using integration times of a few seconds. Two-way range rate measurements are expected to be accurate to 3 mu m/s, thanks to nearly complete cancellation or calibration of the propagation noise from interplanetary plasma and troposphere. We review the experimental configuration of the experiment and outline its scientific goals and expected results. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E

The definitive, peer-reviewed {{and edited}} {{version of this}} article is {{published}} in Perception 39 (3), 289 - 308 2010, 10. 1068 /p 5721 Harman et al (1999, Current Biology 9 1315 – 1318) showed that active exploration of novel objects allows faster recognition of these objects than passive viewing. Here, we examined whether active exploration of particular objects can facilitate subsequent view matching of different objects within the same category. In the generalisation phase, participants performed a matching task between two serially presented views of novel paper-clip objects. When the two views were of the same object, these were related by rotation about the vertical or horizontal axis. Subsequently, in the observation phase, participants were presented with another 5 paper-clip objects. One group of participants (active group) actively explored each of the objects for 20 s using a trackball over a limited range (- 45 ° to + 45 °) of the horizontal axis. The other participants observed a replay of the active exploration of each of these objects by a participant in the active group (passive group) or observed a static view of the objects (still group). Following this observation phase, the generalisation phase was repeated twice for all groups of participants. The active group showed a clear expansion of the generalisation range about the horizontal axis. However, this expansion disappeared when we replicated the experiment using a smaller range of active exploration (- 30 ° to + 30 °) and the experiment in which the participants observed a rotating object within the range of - 45 ° to + 45 °. Furthermore, we found a significant improvement in view generalisation about the vertical axis when participants actively explored objects using a turntable over a range in - 45 ° to + 45 ° of the vertical axis. Most importantly, since participants explored different objects from the ones that were used in the generalisation phase, these results cannot be explained by improvement of the encoding process. The present findings therefore suggest that: (i) active exploration facilitates the process of view matching, (ii) this effect depends on the <b>exploration</b> <b>range</b> and rotational axis, and (iii) interaction between motor and visual information is necessary to facilitate the process of view matching...|$|E
40|$|Stock {{assessment}} {{models are}} {{used to determine the}} population size of fish stocks. Although stock assessment models are complex, they still make simplifying assumptions. Generally, they treat each species separately, include little, if any, spatial structure, and may not adequately quantify uncertainty. These assumptions can introduce bias and can lead to incorrect inferences. This thesis is about more realistic models and their inference. This realism may be incorporated by explicitly modelling complex processes, or by admitting our uncertainty and modelling it correctly. We develop an agent-based model that can describe fish populations as a collection of individuals which differ in their growth, maturation, migration, and mortality. The aim of this model is to better capture the richness in natural processes that determine fish abundance and subsequent population response to anthropogenic removals. However, this detail comes at considerable computational cost. A single model run can take many hours, making inference using standard methods impractical. We apply this model to New Zealand snapper (Pagurus auratus) in northern New Zealand. Next, we developed an age-structured state-space model. We suggest that this sophisticated model has the potential to better represent uncertainty in stock assessment. However, it pushes the boundaries of the current practical limits of computing and we admit that its practical application remains limited until the MCMC mixing issues that we encountered can be resolved. The processes that underpin agent-based models are complex and we may need to seek new sources of data to inform these types of models. To make a start here we derive a state-space model to estimate the path taken by individual fish from the day they are tagged to the day of their recapture. The model uses environmental information collected using pop-up satellite archival tags. We use tag recorded depth and oceanographic temperature to estimate the location at any given time. We apply this model to Antarctic toothfish (Dissostichus mawsoni) in the Ross Sea. Finally, to reduce the computational burden of agent-based models we use Bayesian emulation. This approach replaces the simulation model with an approximating algorithm called an emulator. The emulator is calibrated using relatively few runs of the original model. A good emulator provides a close approximation to the original model and has significant speed gains. Thus, inferences become tractable. We have made the first steps towards developing a tractable approach to fisheries modelling in complex settings through the creation of realistic models, and their emulation. With further development, Bayesian emulation could result in the increased ability to consider and evaluate innovative methods in fisheries modelling.

40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} a rethinking of urban mobility through ecological design. Human mobility and ecological accountability are inextricably linked in city design; our current world ecological crisis underscores this fundamental connection. Through original design <b>exploration</b> <b>ranging</b> in scale from automobiles to tall building clusters, this work proffers a critical vision towards green urbanism. These conceptions challenge the everyday practices of city {{planning and design}} by offering an interdisciplinary framework for design production. The work concludes with the necessity for a new design field entitled "Ecotransology". Ecotransology {{is still in the}} nascent stages. It has the potential to become a far-reaching awareness that bonds the disciplines of road ecology, urban design, transportation planning, automotive engineering, and energy consultation. This work establishes the theoretical foundations for Ecotransology in four parts. Part one, Ideation, is a survey of visions on cities illustrating original concepts such as "Gentle Congestion", "Transport User Interface (TUI) Valley Section" and "Netwheels". Part two, Eco, illustrates the principles of ecological design in projects such as "MATscape" and "Fab Tree Hab". (cont.) Part three, Trans, conveys the principles of smart mobility in "Soft Cars" and "Omni-Flocking" vehicles. Part four, Ecotrans, synthesizes these approaches in a series of designs for circulation in bridged tall building clusters such as "PeristalCity". The work describes a burgeoning field, Ecotransology, which promotes ecological transitions within urban contexts. By linking tall building clusters and cars, unique green design proposals for urbanization were produced, which promote a new role in defining the ciphers of future design thought. by Mitchell Whitney Joachim.

40|$|International audienceThe {{search for}} traces {{of life is}} one of the {{principal}} objectives of Mars exploration. Central to this objective is theconcept of habitability, the set of conditions that allows the appearance of life and successful establishment ofmicroorganisms in any one location. While environmental conditions may have been conducive to the appearanceof life early in martian history, habitable conditions were always heterogeneous on a spatial scale andin a geological time frame. This ‘‘punctuated’’ scenario of habitability would have had important consequencesfor the evolution of martian life, {{as well as for the}} presence and preservation of traces of life at a specificlanding site. We hypothesize that, given the lack of long-term, continuous habitability, if martian life developed,it was (and may still be) chemotrophic and anaerobic. Obtaining nutrition from the same kinds of sourcesas early terrestrial chemotrophic life and living in the same kinds of environments, the fossilized traces of thelatter serve as useful proxies for understanding the potential distribution of martian chemotrophs and theirfossilized traces. Thus, comparison with analog, anaerobic, volcanic terrestrial environments (Early Archean> 3. 5 – 3. 33 Ga) shows that the fossil remains of chemotrophs in such environments were common, althoughsparsely distributed, except in the vicinity of hydrothermal activity where nutrients were readily available. Moreover, the traces of these kinds of microorganisms can be well preserved, provided that they are rapidlymineralized and that the sediments in which they occur are rapidly cemented. We evaluate the biogenicity ofthese signatures by comparing them to possible abiotic features.

Robots may either explore or relay known information, and the team hierarchy corresponds to a tree. As the exploration effort unfolds, robots swap roles within this tree to improve the efficiency of exploration.

This makes it particularly suitable for applications such as robotic search and rescue, where environments are likely to contain significant interference and unexpected communication ranges...|$|R
