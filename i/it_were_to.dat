5|$|In January 1748, Adams {{and some}} friends were {{inflamed}} by British impressment and launched The Independent Advertiser, a weekly newspaper that printed many political essays written by Adams. His essays drew heavily upon English political theorist John Locke's Second Treatise of Government, and they emphasized many of the themes that characterized his subsequent career. He argued that the people must resist any encroachment on their constitutional rights. He cited {{the decline of the}} Roman Empire as an example of what could happen to New England if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> abandon its Puritan values.|$|E
5|$|Michael's {{recklessness}} makes {{a complete}} mess {{of the warehouse}} while jeopardizing the employees' safety. Michael's plans to hold his own seminar backfire when the warehouse workers' gripe session leads to them deciding to form a union. Jan intimidates them into reconsidering, citing a liquidation of the branch if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> unionize.|$|E
5|$|Oil futures spiked on August 15 as analysts {{considered}} {{the impact of}} Hurricane Dean on refining capacity if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> move into the Caribbean as predicted. Transocean evacuated 11 nonessential workers late on August15 from an oil rig located about 160mi (260km) southeast of New Orleans. The company left about 125personnel on board the structure. A day later, Royal Dutch Shell evacuated 275 ancillary staff, following an evacuation of 188 due to Tropical Storm Erin.|$|E

Further transfers <b>were</b> <b>to</b> follow in 1946 when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transferred <b>to</b> Nottingham and Holbeck, Leeds. British Railways took over operation of Britain's railway network in 1948, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> re-numbered from its four-digit LMS number (5699) {{to its current}} five-digit number (45699) and in May <b>was</b> transferred <b>to</b> Bristol Barrow Road.|$|R
50|$|Hanover’s visionary founders <b>were</b> {{clear that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an agency {{different}} from other homelessness service providers. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an organisation driven by evidence and one which recognised its clients as active citizens, with dignity, aspirations, talents and strengths. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> also <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an agency which led change.|$|R

5|$|On 9 November, Fraser {{contacted}} Whitlam {{and invited}} him to negotiations with the Coalition aimed at settling the dispute. Whitlam agreed, and a meeting was set for 9am on Tuesday 11 November, at Parliament House. That Tuesday was also the deadline for an election to be called if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> be held before Christmas. Both Government and Opposition leaders were in Melbourne {{on the night of}} 10 November for the Lord Mayor's banquet. To ensure the Opposition leaders could reach Canberra in time for the meeting, Whitlam brought them back in his VIP aircraft, which arrived in Canberra at midnight.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Disraeli adopted one-nation {{conservatism}} {{for both}} ethical and electoral reasons. Before he became {{leader of the}} Conservative Party, Disraeli had announced that, {{as a result of}} the Reform Act 1867 which had enfranchised the male working-class, the party needed to pursue social reforms if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> have electoral success. One-nationism would both improve the conditions of the poor and portray the Liberal Party as selfish individualists. Because the party portrayed itself as a national (and not class-based) party, it's members were unsure whether to make specific appeals to the working-classes. A more positive approach to the working-class by the party developed later out of the electoral necessity to secure working-class votes.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 an {{exoplanet}} (47 UMa b) {{was announced}} in orbit around 47 Ursae Majoris by Geoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler. The discovery was made by observing the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum corresponding {{to changes in the}} star's radial velocity as the planet's gravity pulled it around. The planet was the first long-period extrasolar planet discovered. Unlike the majority of known such planets, it has a low-eccentricity orbit. The planet is at least 2.53 times the mass of Jupiter and takes 1,078 days or 2.95 years to orbit its star. If <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> be located in the Solar System, it would lie between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1930s {{it became}} clear that a new {{headquarters}} building was needed and very ambitious targets were set for the building: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the tallest building in South Africa (possibly in the whole continent of Africa, {{with the exception of the}} pyramids in Egypt), <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> have the fastest lifts, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> have the largest windows. At the same time <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> epitomise the values of the business: [...] "Strength, Security and Confidence in the Future"; this demanded a combination of traditional and contemporary design.|$|R

50|$|Before <b>it</b> <b>was</b> used, a Whistler-Hearn {{board had}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{set up and}} {{customized}} to the geography of the area at which <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used and for {{the location of the}} guns in the battery <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> direct.|$|R
5|$|In contrast, during wake periods {{differentiated}} effector cells, such as cytotoxic natural killer {{cells and}} CTLs (cytotoxic T lymphocytes), peak in order to elicit an effective response against any intruding pathogens. As well during awake active times, anti-inflammatory molecules, such as cortisol and catecholamines, peak. There are two theories {{as to why the}} pro-inflammatory state is reserved for sleep time. First, inflammation would cause serious cognitive and physical impairments if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> occur during wake times. Second, inflammation may occur during sleep times due to the presence of melatonin. Inflammation causes a great deal of oxidative stress and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this time.|$|E
5|$|The M40 motorway, {{which was}} nearing {{completion}} {{at the time}} of production, doubled for the fictitious M104. In the run-up to the filming of the plane's near-miss with the bridge between Junctions 4 and 5, at Lane End on the High Wycombe Bypass, the Ministry of Transport and the local police ordered that in accordance with Ministry of Civil Aviation regulations, the manoeuvre be performed with the wheels in contact with the tarmac at all times. During a take, a crosswind sprang up and the drag caused by the dummies left Hughes concerned that she would lose control of the Tiger Moth if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> hit the ground. She therefore kept the plane in mid-air while passing under the bridge, clearing it by nine feet (2.7m) as originally planned. On another attempt, the continuing adverse conditions necessitated a second low-level glide, angering the Ministry of Transport official supervising the filming; subsequently, Hughes and production manager were arrested. Hughes, a pilot with more than three decades' flight experience by 1968, later commented that this dangerous stunt marked only {{the first time in her}} career that she had feared for her safety.|$|E

5000|$|Among his own many {{quotations}} are [...] "A conservative {{is one who}} admires radicals centuries after they're dead," [...] "Truth is {{stranger than}} fiction; fiction has to make sense," [...] "We see things as we are, not as they are," [...] and [...] "The purpose of life <b>is</b> not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> happy at all. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> useful, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> honorable. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> compassionate. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> matter, to have it make some difference that you lived."

40|$|History is {{for human}} self- knowledge. Knowing {{yourself}} means knowing, first, what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> person; secondly, knowing what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the kind of}} person you are; and thirdly, knowing what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the person you are and nobody else is. Knowing yourself means knowing what you can do; and since nobody knows what they can do until they try, the only clue to what man can do is what man has done. The value of history, then, <b>is</b> that <b>it</b> teaches us what man has done and thus what man is. ” (R. G...|$|R
50|$|The Beat Bank Branch Canal was an {{abortive}} canal near Manchester, England. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{leave the}} Stockport Branch Canal in South Reddish and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> lock free {{but with a}} short tunnel. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> follow the contour above the right bank of the River Tame, firstly in a northerly direction and then easterly as it followed the meandering course of the river upstream. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> terminate at or near to the coalmining hamlet of Beat Bank in Denton where it could also secure supplies of coal from nearby mines at Haughton Green.|$|R

25|$|Captain Ulm {{was asked}} to mark the {{position}} of his {{troops on the ground}} with colored smoke and to give the disposition of his company with respect to the smoke. It was quickly apparent to the airborne observer that the artillery (now supported by a battery of 155-mm. howitzers at Artillery Base I) had to be shifted if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> be effective, and this was done so.|$|E
25|$|In June 2008 Fox {{announced}} plans to adapt Little Mosque on the Prairie into an American setting, {{in partnership with the}} show's production company, WestWind Pictures. The planned deal would not affect the Canadian version if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> be picked up in the United States by another distributor or network. The U.S. version of the show has never been produced since the acquisition.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{take many}} {{years for the}} navvies to build this line.

25|$|Tsar Nicholas I (r. 1826–1855) of the Russian Empire {{introduced}} {{a policy of}} Russification, including Cyrillisation. From the 1840s on, Russia considered introducing the Cyrillic script for spelling the Polish language, with the first school books printed in the 1860s. The imperial government's attempts failed, however: the Polish population put up a tough resistance, as it saw its language as expressed in its Latin alphabet {{as a source of}} national pride, and threatened to rebel if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> be abolished.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the original rumors of the eventual NHL expansion team in Las Vegas, ESPN writer Scott Burnside noted several obstacles that would be faced by the city if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> become a professional sports market, including the presence of legal sports betting, scheduling conflicts with {{the large number of}} residents who work nighttime and overnight shifts, and that the casinos would be unlikely to give away tickets to such events as a promotion, as they run contrary to a goal of encouraging patrons to remain in their facilities.|$|E
25|$|The {{reasons for}} revelation were both {{political}} and practical. The cost over-runs of the project were now so enormous (approximately £1 billion by 1979) that the secret inner-Cabinet spending approvals could not continue. The key decision to proceed had been taken in 1975, four years previously, and cancellation {{would be unlikely to}} save money at that point. Even if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> be cancelled, a replacement would have to be ordered in any case. Shortly afterwards the Thatcher government decided that the successor system should be the Trident system and ordered the C4 variant.|$|E

25|$|Porter {{sold the}} {{terminal}} {{at the island}} airport in Toronto to Nieuport Aviation Infrastructure Partners GP in January 2015. According to Deluce, {{this meant that the}} airline was debt-free, although it would now pay to lease the facility. The sale was estimated to be in the range of 750 million. Being debt-free was considered a good position to be in, if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> buy Bombardier CS100 jets to use at the island airport. However, in November 2015, the federal government announced it would not support the proposal to expand the island airport.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{spends more}} on the {{organization}} than all other members combined. Criticism of the organization by then newly elected US President Donald Trump caused various reactions from American and European political figures, ranging from ridicule to panic. Pew Research Center's 2016 survey among its member states showed that while most countries viewed NATO positively, most NATO members preferred keeping their military spending the same. The response to whether their country should militarily aid another NATO country if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> get into a serious military conflict with Russia was also mixed. Only in the US and Canada did more than 50% of the people answer that they should.|$|E
25|$|The bomb had a {{yield of}} 50 megaton TNT (210 PJ). In theory, {{it had a}} maximum yield of 100 megatons if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> have {{included}} a U-238 tamper, but because only one bomb was built, this was never demonstrated. The single bomb was detonated at the Sukhoy Nos cape of Severny Island, part of Novaya Zemlya. It was decided that a full 100 Mt detonation would create too great a risk of nuclear fallout, {{as well as a}} near certainty that the release plane and crew would be destroyed before it could escape the blast radius.|$|E
