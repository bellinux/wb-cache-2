25|$|According to the naturalistic view, the flourishing {{of society}} is not, {{or not the}} only, {{intrinsically}} good thing. Defenses of this notion are often formulated by reference to biology, and observations that living things compete more with their own kind than with other kinds. Rather, what is of intrinsic good is the flourishing of all sentient life, extending to those animals that have some level of similar sentience, such as Great Ape personhood. Others <b>go</b> <b>farther,</b> declaring that life itself is of intrinsic value.|$|E
25|$|Brentford and Waller were {{excellent}} strategists of the 17th century type, {{and neither}} would fight a pitched battle without every chance in his favour. Eventually on 29 June, the Royalists {{were successful in}} a series of minor fights about Cropredy Bridge.

Waller had been left to do as best he could, and a worse fate was soon to overtake the cautious earl.|$|E

25|$|After {{a second}} golden {{age in the}} early 6th century, the empire began to decline, {{eventually}} ceasing its production of coins in the early 7th century. Around this same time, the Aksumite population was forced to <b>go</b> <b>farther</b> inland to the highlands for protection, abandoning Aksum as the capital. Arab writers of the time continued to describe Ethiopia (no longer referred to as Aksum) as an extensive and powerful state, though they had lost control {{of most of the}} coast and their tributaries. While land was lost in the north, it was gained in the south; and, though Ethiopia was no longer an economic power, it still attracted Arab merchants. The capital was moved to a new location, currently unknown, though it may have been called Ku'bar or Jarmi.|$|E

500|$|Others use machinima in drama; {{these works}} {{may or may}} not retain signs of their video game provenance. Unreal Tournament is often used for science fiction and Battlefield 1942 for war, but some artists subvert their chosen game's setting or {{completely}} detach their work from it. In 1999, Strange Company used Quake II in Eschaton: Nightfall, a horror film {{based on the work of}} H. P. Lovecraft (although Quake I was also based on the Lovecraft lore). [...] A later example is Damien Valentine's series Consanguinity, made using BioWare's 2002 computer game Neverwinter Nights and based on the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Another genre consists of experimental works that attempt to push the boundaries of game engines. One example, Fountainhead's Anna, is a short film that focuses on the cycle of life and is reminiscent of Fantasia. Other productions <b>go</b> <b>farther</b> and completely eschew a 3-D appearance. Friedrich Kirschner's The Tournament and The Journey deliberately appear hand-drawn, and Dead on Que's Fake Science resembles two-dimensional Eastern European modernist animation from the 1970s.|$|E

2500|$|The ancient Chinese {{found that}} salt, because it {{inhibits}} bacteria, was useful both in preserving foods and in controlling fermentation; without salt, the yeasts and sugars produced by vegetable decay would rot {{and turn to}} alcohol.

Douchi, which {{was found in a}} tomb dated 165 BCE, is salted and fermented soy beans, the oldest food made from that product.

2500|$|In {{partisan}} discourse Don Javier {{is generally}} held in high esteem, though Left-wing Partido Carlista militants and Right-wing Traditionalists offer strikingly different pictures of him.

Authors remaining within the Traditionalist orthodoxy suggest that generally conservative, but in his 70s impaired by age, bewildered by Vaticanum II, misled and possibly incapacitated by his children, Don Javier presided over destruction of Carlism. Few <b>go</b> <b>farther</b> and claiming that evidence points to Don Javier having been fully supportive of the course sponsored by his son, they either talk about [...] "deserción de la dinastía" [...] or – with some hesitation - point to treason.

2500|$|Drews {{thinks that}} we can <b>go</b> <b>farther</b> and ascribe the change to Pope Gelasius I (492-96).

Gennadius I says that he composed a sacramentary (De. vir. ill., c. xciv). Moreover, the Liber Pontificalis refers to his liturgical work (Origines, 122) and the Stowe Missal (7th century) puts {{at the head of the}} Canon the title: [...] "Canon dominicus Papæ Gelasi" [...] (ed. Warren, 234). Baumer has collected all the evidences for Gelasius's authorship of some important sacramentary (Histor. Jahrb., 1893, 244 sqq.). It is known that Gelasius did not compose the text of the Canon. Its component parts have been traced back to a far earlier date. But would not so vital a change in its arrangement best explain the tradition that persistently connects the recent Canon with the name of Gelasius? ...|$|E
