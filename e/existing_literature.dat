Environmental psychologist Michael Dudley pointed out copy-editing errors such as misspellings, and complained that Florida ignored <b>existing</b> <b>literature</b> on the topic of the connections between personalities and places. Likewise, Tom Hutton in the journal Economic Geography noted the absence of influential academics Allen Scott and Peter Hall in the text.|$|E
5|$|The book {{presents}} {{case histories}} {{of all the}} twin-pairs studied and the raw data from the analyses. Its last chapters put the results {{in the context of}} existing studies, and presented a new theory and model to explain the causes and continuance of the disorder. The environmental aspects the researchers checked drew on <b>existing</b> <b>literature,</b> and multiple judgments were pooled to both compare and mutually cancel differing criteria for diagnosing schizophrenia. The theory in the book was that many genes work together to dispose a person to the disorder under certain environmental pressures. The model provided no specific therapeutic insight, but was useful as a guideline for further study.|$|E

25|$|After the {{dissolution}} of Soviet Union and the switch to the market economy, Russian authors now had to struggle with unfamiliar realities of a free publishing system. The hopes of a creative boom never materialized, as publishers were eager to exploit the lucrative pulp literature market (virtually nonexistent before) largely ignoring the <b>existing</b> <b>literature</b> establishment. This led to rather low confidence in domestic authors, and it was extremely {{hard to find a}} publisher ready to invest in a local writer.|$|E

25|$|A study {{published}} in 2013 which the <b>existing</b> <b>literature</b> found that energy payback time was between 0.75 and 3.5 years with thin film cells being {{at the lower end}} and multi-si-cells having a payback time of 1.5-2.6 years. A 2015 review assessed the energy payback time and EROI of solar photovoltaics. In this meta study, which uses an insolation of 1700nbsp&kWh/m2/year and a system lifetime of 30 years, mean harmonized EROIs between 8.7 and 34.2 were found. Mean harmonized energy payback time varied from 1.0 to 4.1 years. Crystalline silicon devices achieve on average an energy payback period of 2 years.|$|E

Few of them take into considerations {{of the dynamics}} of credit risk and are able to endogenously estimate the portfolio recovery (loss) rate. Within the framework of structural form credit models, this paper suggests combining a cash flow based credit model and a conditional independent default approach, such as the factor copula or the Fourier transform methods, to estimate the multi‐period credit risk of a corporate credit portfolio. The proposed approach differs from most <b>existing</b> <b>literatures</b> in that it considers the dynamics of risk structure and is able to endogenously estimate the portfolio recovery (loss) rate.

A separate set of translation works was re-grouped into two major collections popularly known as bka’-’gyur and bstan-’gyur, translation of Buddha’s discourses and translation of commentarial works respectively. The very first Tibetan catalogue was introduced during the period of the 39th Tibetan King khri-lde srong-btsen, also known as sad-na legs-mjing-gyon (776-815), who issued decrees “requiring all translation works that were extant in Tibetan from their Indian original to be catalogued and subjected to be recurrently reviewed and to set guidelines of terminology in order to standardize all translation works”. A team of Indian and Tibetan scholars was assigned for the purpose.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to examine the {{relationship}} between psychological empowerment and organizational commitment of academics in Malaysian Private Universities. The research is aim to appraise the <b>existing</b> <b>literatures</b> and eventually set the research agenda. Past studies revealed that there are relationships between the four cognitions of psychological empowerment: meaning, self-determination, competence and impact cognitions with organizational commitment. Furthermore, the extant literature also encapsulates the relationships between psychological empowerment and the three dimensions of organizational commitment: affective, normative and continuance commitment. However, results from the <b>existing</b> <b>literatures</b> are shown to be inconsistent. The paper concludes with suggestions for educational leaders to focus on enhancing psychological empowerment of impact, meaning and competence cognitions in order to increase academic staff commitment within an organization. Successfully shaping the attitude of academics in private universities will lead to improvement of overall organizational performancePsychological Empowerment, Organizational Commitment...|$|R

The route for planning theory aims to establish categories of laws under which particular events of planning may be summarized and explained.

This paper aims to highlight the importance of information technology in planning theory and planning practice at large.
