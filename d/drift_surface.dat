40|$|This work {{is devoted}} to the study of {{magnetic}} islands and resonances of <b>drift</b> <b>surfaces</b> which can take place in the magnetic field of a Helias configuration and which affect the particle confinement properties. It is shown that due to internal magnetic field perturbations which are periodic in major and minor circumference of the torus large islands occur in the magnetic configuration and, in particular, in the <b>drift</b> <b>surfaces.</b> In contrast to external perturbations which arise from errors in the coil system and which can be kept below a tolerable level these internal perturbations may originate from the the finite beta effect or - in the time dependent case - from MHD instabilities in the plasma. In the present analysis the amplitude of these perturbations is considered as an arbitrary parameter.

40|$|Purpose: Watamaniuk, McKee & Grzywacz (1995) have {{reported}} that observers are surprisingly efficient at detecting a single coherently moving dot within an array of short-lifetime noise dots. A {{possible explanation is that}} visual system pools over outputs of local motion detectors along spatio-temporally coherent trajectories (i. e. trajectories consistent with a velocity of the local motion). This strategy would improve signal strength for motion along an extended trajectory. We tested whether observers exhibit sub-threshold summation of motion energy distributed over spatio-temporally coherent trajectories. Method: Subject's task was to detect motion embedded in noise. Dynamic white noise was convolved with a local spatio-temporally oriented filter, resulting in a <b>drifting</b> <b>surface</b> with limited temporal correlations (pixel correlations fell to zero within 70 ms, or 0. 63 ° of movement). The <b>drifting</b> <b>surface</b> was blended with background noise using a small gaussian spatial window (s= 0. 5 °), which moved at the same speed as the <b>drifting</b> <b>surface</b> (9. 4 °/s) along a trajectory extending 6. 3 °. The gaussian window moved either {{in the same direction as}} the surface motion (coherent condition), in the opposite direction (opposite condition), or in an orthogonal direction (orthogonal condition). In the coherent condition, the local motion energy propagates along a global 'trajectory' that is consistent with the motion signal, while in the other conditions it does not. On each trial, observers indicated whether the trajectory was located to the left, to the right, below, or above the fixation point (4 AFC). The signal-to-noise ratio was varied to determine thresholds. Results: Detection thresholds were the same across the three conditions. Motion propagating along a consistent trajectory did not improve the detection of the motion. Conclusions: We found no evidence that spatio-temporal coherence facilitates detection of sub-threshold motion energy. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

As the test particle the tungsten ion is taken. KEY WORDS: drift wave electric field, electrostatic islands, particle trapping process, impurity ion transport, helical magnetic field We would like to emphasize that the drift-wave-like electrostatic field can be helpful to remove the impurity ions from the periphery of the magnetic confinement volume to outside. The physics mechanism of such transport of heavy ions is rather similar to that one found in [1] for the high energy ions, so called, cold D-particles and named as the estafette of drift resonances.

40|$|Using {{classical}} perturbation theory, a Hamiltonian {{description of}} the guiding center motion of relativistic electrons in a torus with an axially symmetric magnetic field is derived. The magnetic field itself generates concentric circular flux surfaces. This description enables us to assess {{the behavior of the}} drift orbits such that previously unknown details follow almost naturally due to the introduction of higher order terms in the description. The rotational transform of the orbit for a given particle is found to decrease when the particle energy increases and the radius of the particle orbit is almost constant during acceleration. As a consequence, the minor radius of a <b>drift</b> <b>surface</b> with a (fixed) rotational transform 1 /q(D) is always smaller than the radius of the magnetic flux surface with q=q(D) from which the particle started with zero energy. At a critical energy, the <b>drift</b> <b>surface</b> has collapsed to a point in the poloidal cross section. Above this critical energy there is no particle orbit with the commensurate rotational transform 1 /q(D). When the symmetry of the magnetic field is broken by harmonic perturbations with amplitudes that increase towards the plasma edge, the resonant magnetic surfaces and drift surfaces break up, and form chains of islands.

40|$|Passing alpha {{particles}} in a Helias reactor (major radius 22 m, plasma radius 1. 8 m, magnetic field 5 T) are well confined if only Coulomb collisions perturb the particle orbits and neoclassical diffusion {{is the only}} transport process. In a turbulent plasma close to the beta limit particle orbits can become chaotic and enhanced losses of these particles may arise thus diminishing the alpha particle heating rate. The paper describes the guiding center orbits of passing {{particles in}} the magnetic field of the Helias reactor, where islands of the magnetic surfaces occur at the boundary. <b>Drift</b> <b>surfaces</b> also exhibit these islands, however, resonance surfaces with islands in <b>drift</b> <b>surfaces</b> can also exist inside the plasma. Numerically the rotational transform of the drift orbits has been computed verifying this feature. Using a mapping technique, the long term behaviour of the drift orbits is analysed {{taking into account the}} variation of energy due to plasma oscillations. This leads to two coupled area-preserving maps, which describe enhanced radial transport of particles satisfying the resonance condition. In phase space the anomalous transport occurs along the resonance lines of the Arnold web. The energy of the particles can vary in a chaotic manner if the amplitude of the oscillations is large enough. In model calculations it is shown that resonant alpha particles can be rapidly lost by Arnold diffusion If this loss of alpha particles only occurs at the beta limit, it may help to stabilize the operation point against thermal instability by reducing the heating power. If drift waves contribute to alpha particles losses way below the beta limit, the Arnold diffusion, this anomalous loss is threatening the ignition in the Helias reactor. (orig.)
