40|$|Abstract. With {{accelerating}} urbanization construction, {{especially with}} the scale enlargement of high-rise buildings, the crane’s <b>hoist</b> <b>boom</b> length and height is increasing. The <b>hoist</b> <b>boom</b> will produce strength and buckling failure easily on the working condition of complex combination, such as gravity, wind load and inertia force. The TC 6010 crane was analyzed the mechanics by finite element method. This thesis got its stability and strength data in four kinds of working conditions. It can provide certain reference value for other crane’s design and calculation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{interchangeability}} of a standard section and determine the tower body of the optimal combination-matching, taking 45 combination schemes of three models of tower cranes for example, the ANSYS for <b>hoist</b> <b>boom</b> at working state of the diagonal of tower body {{have been used to}} make the calculation and analysis, the distribution map of the total displacement and the axial force at this condition have been obtained. According to the results, the stiffness, strength and stability of tower body have been analyzed. The tower body of the optimal combination-matching is chosen by the fuzzy evaluation method. It is proved that the optimal combination-matching through the fuzzy evaluation method is accord with production requirement...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{establishes}} a flexible dynamics model of MQ 2533 portal crane boom system. In {{the premise of}} ignoring control system, this paper analysis the mechanical dynamics of <b>boom</b> <b>hoisting</b> system. Simulation results show that: Dynamics response of the <b>hoisting</b> <b>boom</b> system have great fluctuation when excluding the control effects, this paper provide a theoretical basis for crane hoisting system to optimize control strategies, which committed to improve their performance and ensure safety, reliability and economy...|$|R
50|$|Electro-hydraulic {{equipment}} used in mining operations employ rotary unions including shuttle cars and coal cars, drill heads, backhoes, clam shell cranes and drag lines. In addition, <b>boom</b> <b>hoists,</b> retrieving drums and bucket drum clutches each require rotary unions.|$|R
40|$|When a large crane is used near a radio {{broadcasting}} antenna it operates {{as an effective}} receiving antenna and a voltage is induced at the crane hook, which gives a worker an electric shock and makes an obstacle their work. The voltage and a current distribution on a <b>hoist</b> cable, a <b>boom,</b> and a mast of the crane are analyzed by FDTD method. As the result an equivalent circuit of the crane on which the high voltage is generated becomes a parallel resonance circuit. This paper shows the result of the　analysis...|$|R
50|$|In 2007, the United Arab Emirates {{announced}} it {{had signed a}} memorandum of understanding with Airbus to purchase three A330 MRTT. EADS, Airbus's parent company, announced the signing of a contract with UAE in February 2008.The UAE aircraft will be equipped with both an ARBS and two Cobham 905E under-wing refuelling pods. The ARBS units installed on these tankers include a secondary <b>boom</b> <b>hoist</b> developed for the UAE. This system permits the boom to be retracted, even {{in the event of}} a primary boom retraction system failure. The United Arab Emirates Air Force selected the Rolls-Royce Trent 700 for its tankers.|$|R
5000|$|On 10 September 2012 at {{approximately}} 19:30 (CEST), an A330 MRTT's refuelling boom became detached in flight {{at an altitude}} of [...] in Spanish airspace. The boom separated cleanly at a mechanical joint and fell to the ground, while the aircraft landed safely in Getafe. There were no injuries caused by the malfunction. The incident {{was the result of a}} conflict between the backup <b>boom</b> <b>hoist</b> (fitted to the UAE-destined A330 MRTTs) and the primary boom retraction mechanism, and was attributable to the testing being conducted. Airbus later explained that the malfunction was not possible under ordinary operating conditions, and that procedures had been designed to avoid similar incidents in the future. Following the incident, INTA, the Spanish regulatory authority, issued precautionary restrictions to other users of boom-equipped A330s.|$|R
60|$|I had {{solved the}} problem which had arisen through the {{shortness}} of the shears. By means of the watch-tackle (I had made a new one), I heaved {{the butt of the}} foremast across the rail and then lowered it to the deck. Next, by means of the shears, I <b>hoisted</b> the main <b>boom</b> on board. Its forty feet of length would supply the height necessary properly to swing the mast. By means of a secondary tackle I had attached to the shears, I swung the boom to a nearly perpendicular position, then lowered the butt to the deck, where, to prevent slipping, I spiked great cleats around it. The single block of my original shears-tackle I had attached {{to the end of the}} boom. Thus, by carrying this tackle to the windlass, I could raise and lower the end of the boom at will, the butt always remaining stationary, and, by means of guys, I could swing the boom from side to side. To the end of the boom I had likewise rigged a hoisting tackle; and when the whole arrangement was completed I could not but be startled by the power and latitude it gave me.|$|R
50|$|A modern ice yacht {{is made of}} a single-piece {{backbone}} {{the entire}} length of the boat, and a runner-plank upon which it rests at right angles, the two forming a kite-shaped frame. The best woods for these pieces are basswood, butternut, and pine. They are cut from the log in such a way that the heart of the timber expands, giving the planks a permanent curve, which, in the finished boat, is turned upward. The two forward runners, usually made of soft cast iron and about 2 ft. 7 in. long and 24 in high, are set into oak frames a little over 5 feet long and 5 inches high. The runners have a cutting edge of 90%, though a V-shaped edge is often preferred for racing. The rudder is a runner about 3 ft. 7 in. long, worked by a tiller, sometimes made very long, 7½ feet not being uncommon. This enables the helmsman to lie in the box at full length and steer with his feet, leaving his hands free to tend the sheet. Masts and spars are generally made hollow for racing-yachts and the rigging is pliable steel wire. The sails are of 10-ounce duck for a boat carrying 400 sq ft of canvas. They have very high peaks, short <b>hoists</b> and long <b>booms.</b> The mainsail and jib rig is general, but a double-masted lateen rig has been found advantageous. The foremost ice-yacht builder of America was G. E. Buckhout of Poughkeepsie.|$|R
