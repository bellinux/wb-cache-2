2500|$|However, Pântea's own testimonies on the Holocaust subject have various ambiguities and omissions. Mark Mazower notes that, {{in writing}} his reports, Pântea never {{realized}} {{the level of}} Antonescu's involvement in the 1941 Massacre. Before the official recognition of Holocaust crimes, the Odessa Mayor's accounts were being cited against themselves by those who tried to minimize Romanian involvement. In reaction, Jewish community historian Teodor Wexler argued that the attempt was missing its target: [...] "Gherman Pântea's letter [...] of an unrestrained tragicalness", confirming [...] "once {{and for all the}} <b>historical</b> <b>responsibility</b> of those who dictated the undertaking of the Holocaust in Romania." ...|$|E
2500|$|A third {{approach}} {{looks at}} the problem {{from the perspective of}} who has contributed most to the problem. Because the industrialized countries have contributed {{more than two-thirds of the}} stock of human-induced GHGs in the atmosphere, this approach suggests that they should bear the largest share of the costs. This stock of emissions has been described as an [...] "environmental debt" [...] (Munasinghe et al., 1996, p.167). In terms of efficiency, this view is not supported. This is because efficiency requires incentives to be forward-looking, and not retrospective (Goldemberg et al., 1996, p.29). The question of <b>historical</b> <b>responsibility</b> is a matter of ethics. Munasinghe et al. (1996, p.167) suggested that developed countries could address the issue by making side-payments to developing countries.|$|E

50|$|Climate {{justice is}} a term used for framing global warming as an ethical and {{political}} issue, rather than one that is purely environmental or physical in nature. This is done by relating the {{effects of climate change}} to concepts of justice, particularly environmental justice and social justice and by examining issues such as equality, human rights, collective rights, and the <b>historical</b> <b>responsibilities</b> for climate change. A fundamental proposition of climate justice is that those who are least responsible for climate change suffer its gravest consequences.Occasionally, the term is also used to mean actual legal action on climate change issues.|$|R

40|$|The {{agreement}} reached at the 21 st Conference of Parties (COP 21) in Paris in December 2015 evoked mixed reactions in India. While its prime minister {{declared that the}} deal was a win for 'climate justice', the environment minister reportedly stated that the agreement {{could have been more}} ambitious, as the actions of developed nations were 'far below' their <b>historical</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> There was, however, a visible shift in India's stance at COP 21 in comparison with previous climate summits. Arguably, this shift began in 2010 in Cancun, when India pledged its first climate target (to reduce the emissions intensity of GDP by 20 â 25 per cent by 2020 from 2005 levels, soon after China announced its emissions intensity target), and it was further defined at COP 21...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{stability of}} coalitions for greenhouse gas abatement under different sharing rules {{applied to the}} gains from cooperation. We use a 12 -region model to examine internal and external stability of coalitions. We determine and compare stable coalitions under different surplus sharing rules; for example, grandfathering (sharing proportional to current emissions) {{and a number of}} equitable rules, i. e. sharing according to <b>historical</b> <b>responsibilities</b> for past emissions. Due to strong free-rider incentives we find only small stable coalitions for all sharing rules examined. We observe that stable coalitions consist of regions with low marginal abatement costs that are attractive partners in any coalition and regions receiving the highest shares of the surplus from cooperation under a particular sharing rule. We find that equitable rules may not be conducive to success: in fact, a grandfathering scheme leads to the most successful coalition in terms of global abatement and global welfar...|$|R

40|$|The end of {{the cold}} war has created a safer {{environment}} for most nations and reduced the need for fielding huge armed forces and vast investments for defense. However, due to her very special strategic position and <b>historical</b> <b>responsibilities,</b> Turkey still faces a range of substantial threats to its national interests, physical security, economic well being. These threats require the maintenance of a broad set of military capabilities in order to deter, and if necessary, to fight and win any future conflict. This thesis investigates the Turkish Defense Industry and Turkey's efforts to transfer military technology to establish a required technological base for a self- sufficient defense industry, which can fulfill the needs of the Turkish Armed Forces and stay competitive in a rapidly changing market place. The goal of this project is to evaluate the present Turkish Defense Industry and to present strategies that should be carefully considered in developing a sound defense industry and technological base policy...|$|R

We use a 12 -regions model designed to examine internal and external stability of coalitions (STACO).

As a general pattern we observe that coalitions consist of regions with low marginal abatement costs, which are attractive partners in any coalition, and regions which have the highest claims according to the respective sharing rule. Furthermore, we find that a grandfathering scheme leads to the largest and – in terms of greenhouse gas abatement – most successful coalition, while many of the equitable rules achieve very little.

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the Holocaust, Israel's security is officially regarded as part of Germany's 'reason of state'. Yet the criteria for a responsible relationship between Germany and Israel are by no means self-evident or without logical or practical contradictions. One of the complications is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In order to better understand this complication, I examine two familiar national narratives, one from each side, about possible connections between the Nazi era, the Holocaust, and this conflict. I also put the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in a broader historical context. It turns out that the examined relationships are not as obvious as the familiar narratives describe them. The origins of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are older than the Nazi era and the Holocaust, and they also point to broader European responsibilities more generally, to Europe's nationalism, anti-Semitism, colonialism and imperialism - with irresponsibilities towards both Jews and Arabs. In no way does such a comprehensive perspective affect Germany’s special <b>historical</b> <b>responsibilities</b> resulting from the Holocaust. But it puts the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in a more complete and also more honest framework, with consequences for Germany’s moral and political position...|$|R

40|$|Primo Levi’s {{works of}} testimony, from If This Is a Man to The Drowned and the Saved, seek {{not only to}} connect history and memory but also to provide general social and {{political}} perspectives relevant {{to the end of}} the twentieth century. The voice of this diaspora Jew has had echoes in a country which has recently begun to acknowledge its <b>historical</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> Levi’s thoughts on shame, on violence and on the need to face collective responsibilities have been applied by Australian intellectuals to two specifically Australian issues. The first is a literary hoax which triggered a major cultural controversy in 1995, now widely known as the ‘Demidenko affair’. The second is the relationship between Australian identity and the ‘stolen generations’ of Aboriginal children and young adults forcibly taken from their families between 1910 and 1970 and compelled to grow up isolated from their culture. The aftermath of the forced removals has produced widespread debates about national responsibility and the need to offer a public apology to Aboriginal Australians for this and other wrongs. I attempt to show how dialogue with Levi’s reflections expands the ethical and political dimensions of Australian self‐examination, particularly in some works by the philosopher Raimond Gaita (who comes from a Romanian‐German background) and the political scientist Robert Manne (son and grandson of Holocaust survivors) ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the representations of the Israeli Palestinian conflict in the British press, starting from the premise that media representations in Britain should be analysed in relation to Britain’s role as a postcolonial power. Focusing on Britain’s colonial and postcolonial connection to this conflict, this study {{is based on the}} findings of a Postcolonial Critical Discourse Analysis of four British national newspapers (the Guardian, or Manchester Guardian; The Times; the Daily Herald, or the Sun; and the Daily Mirror) at four different points during the history of the conflict. The findings indicate that the classification of Palestine, Palestinians, Israel, Israelis, Jews, Zionists and Arabs as agents of political violence evolved over time, as violent acts and agents were perceived differently according to the dominant political discourse during each period. The contextualization of the conflict also provides insights into how the British press constructed its various ideological positions in relation to this conflict, {{and the extent to which}} the British Mandate remained visible in the later coverage of the conflict. The postcolonial approach adopted in this study indicates that the generalized lack of references to the historical facts that underpin Britain’s role in the development of the conflict represents an attempt to move away from the <b>historical</b> <b>responsibilities</b> derived from colonial encounters. This framework therefore helps to restore the largely neglected historical connection of the British Mandate to its proper place in the analysis of these mediated events...|$|R

40|$|International {{response}} to tackle climate change {{resulted in the}} establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 1992 (IPCC), entrusted with the task to present scientific findings to develop international legal framework on climate change. IPCC presented four reports and fifth report is around the corner which successively endorsed the climate change phenomena, its impacts and vulnerabilities of the different regions mostly inhabited by the third world countries. International efforts to tackle the climate change phenomenon resulted in the designing of the United Nations Convention Framework on the Climate Change 1992 (UNFCCC) embedding different environmental principles and the most pivotal one was the principle of common but differentiated <b>responsibilities</b> reinforcing the <b>historical</b> <b>responsibilities</b> notion of the developed countries to help developing countries in terms of finance and technology. This principle remained the guiding principle of UNFCCC negotiations since 1992 between developed and developing countries and got legal expression in the Kyoto Protocol 1997 (upto 2012 and extended up to 2020 on interim basis to frame new agreement by 2015, applicable by 2020) to UNFCCC which prescribed compulsory obligations to developed countries and provided cushion of time allowance for developing countries obligations to reduce the carbon emissions; the real objective of UNFCCC and the financial help and technological transfer for adaptation and mitigation the carbon emissions. Unfortunately, developing countries could not effectively implement the climate change obligations and could not equip themselves to put themselves on the path of sustainable development resultantly having stalled round of negotiations in each year Conference of Parties (COP) except in COP 17 at Durban 2011 where it was principally agreed that new regime or agreement needed to be sketched by 2015, to be applied by 2020, applicable to all parties (moving away from the cornerstone principle of common but differentiated responsibilities) but developing countries started interpreting the cornerstone principle in such a manner and terms to suit them like the common but shared <b>responsibilities</b> according to <b>historical</b> sharing towards carbon emissions for each country which choked the negotiation process and endangered the negotiation for new international climate treaty to tackle climate change horrendous effects on the earth eco-system...|$|R
