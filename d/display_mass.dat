Notable examples include Megatron, Soundwave and his operatives Ravage, Rumble, Frenzy, Laserbeak, the transporter Astrotrain and the Autobot Blaster. Long since regarded as a source of confusion, such technology first received a full-scale explanation in the final issue of the Generation One version of Dreamwave Productions' More Than Meets The Eye series, which focused on many different aspects of Transformers technology and other information. In IDW Publishing's Transformers: Escalation it is also mentioned that it takes considerable power to accomplish this feat.

40|$|Lead and Tl isotope intensities and ratios were {{measured}} in radial and axial plasma profiles using multi-collector inductively-coupled-plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). Signal profiles for 204 Pb, 206 Pb, 207 Pb and 208 Pb <b>display</b> <b>mass</b> dependent radial and axial distributions in the plasma. In radial profiles lighter isotopes exhibit greater dispersal from the plasma axis than heavier isotopes, {{in agreement with}} ICP-MS elemental observations. However, signal maxima (I max) for heavier Pb isotopes occur closer to the load coil than I max for lighter Pb isotopes, the reverse of ICP-MS elemental observations. These mass dependent distributions predict that the radial dispersion and axial I max locations for 203 Tl and 205 Tl isotopes should occur interspersed with the values for simultaneously measured Pb isotopes. Instead however, their values are appropriate for masses greater that 208 Pb, indicating that the observed profiles are not {{the product of a}} single stage mass dependent process and that other element properties also effect the distributions. Isotope ratio (and thus mass bias) variation with sampling depth reflects both the mass dependent separation of the numerator and denominator isotope I max along the axis of the plasma and the distance along the axis of the plasma over which the isotope signals are distributed. Addition of matrix to the plasma significantly reduces the variability of these two characteristics suggesting that more accurate correction of instrumental mass bias and more accurate normalization of sample ratios to standard values could be achieved by addition of a common matrix to samples and standards. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Nine non {{noble metal}} {{catalysts}} NNMCs from five different laboratories were investigated for the catalysis of O 2 electroreduction in an acidic medium. The catalyst precursors were synthesized by wet impregnation, planetary ball milling, a foamingagent technique, or a templating method. All catalyst precursors {{were subjected to}} one or more heat treatments at 700 1050 C in an inert or reactive atmosphere. These catalysts underwent an identical set of electrochemical characterizations, including rotatingdisk electrode and polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell PEMFC tests and voltammetry under N 2. Ex situ characterization was comprised of X ray photoelectron spectroscopy, neutron activation analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and N 2 adsorption and its analysis with an advanced model for carbonaceous powders. In PEMFC, several NNMCs <b>display</b> <b>mass</b> activities of 10 20 A g 1 at 0. 8 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode, and one shows 80 A g 1. The latter value corresponds to a volumetric activity of 19 A cm 3 under reference conditions and represents one seventh of the target defined by the U. S. Department of Energy for 2010 130 A cm 3. The activity of all NNMCs is mainly governed by the microporous surface area, and active sites seem to be hosted in pore sizes of 5 15. The nitrogen and metal iron or cobalt seem to be present in sufficient amounts in the NNMCs and do not limit activity. The paper discusses probable directions for synthesizing more active NNMCs. This could be achieved through multiple pyrolysis steps, ball milling steps, and control of the powder morphology by the addition of foaming agents and or sulfu...|$|E

40|$|We perform {{calculations}} of isolated disc galaxies to investigate how {{the properties of}} the ISM, the nature of molecular clouds, and the global star formation rate depend on the level of stellar feedback. We adopt a simple physical model, which includes a galactic potential, a standard cooling and heating prescription of the ISM, and self gravity of the gas. Stellar feedback is implemented by injecting energy into dense, gravitationally collapsing gas, but is independent of the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation. We obtain fractions of gas, and filling factors for different phases of the ISM in reasonable ageement with observations. Supernovae are found to be vital to reproduce the scale heights of the different components of the ISM, and velocity dispersions. The GMCs formed in the simulations <b>display</b> <b>mass</b> spectra similar to the observations, their normalisation dependent on the level of feedback. We find ~ 40 per cent of the clouds exhibit retrograde rotation, induced by cloud-cloud collisions. The star formation rates we obtain are in good agreement with the observed Schmidt-Kennicutt relation, and are not strongly dependent on the star formation efficiency we assume, being largely self regulated by the feedback. We also investigate the effect of spiral structure by comparing calculations with and without the spiral component of the potential. The main difference with a spiral potential is that more massive GMCs are able to accumulate in the spiral arms. Thus we are able to reproduce massive GMCs, and the spurs seen in many grand design galaxies, even with stellar feedback. The presence of the spiral potential does not have an explicit effect on the star formation rate, but can increase the star formation rate indirectly by enabling the formation of long-lived, strongly bound clouds.

40|$|Sulfur {{isotopes}} <b>display</b> <b>mass</b> independent fractionation (MIF) {{according to}} pyrite morphology in some late Archean Hamersley Basin sediments [1]. These data provide valuable {{insight into the}} distribution of late Archean microbial habitats when analysed {{in the context of}} depositional environment and the carbon isotope systematics of the host rock,. In the shallow water sediments of the ~ 2. 6 Ga Wittenoom and Carawine Formations, variably negative organic carbon isotopic compositions occur without a corresponding carbonate carbon isotope depletion, while multiple pyrite morphologies exhibit little variation in sulfur MIF values in individual samples. This pyrite displays two distinct sulfur isotope distribution patterns. One is indicative of microbial sulfate reduction in a somewhat oxidised environment, with low negative Δ 33 S corresponding to a diverse range of positive and negative δ 34 S values. The other may represent an atmospheric mixing array with positive Δ 33 S values corresponding to generally positive δ 34 S [2]. Regardless of morphology, the pyrite in each sample contains sulfur from a common source. In the relatively deeper water sediments of the ~ 2. 7 Ga Jeerinah Formation, morphology dependent pyrite sulfur MIF occurs together with depleted carbonate carbon isotope compositions and the strongly depleted organic carbon isotope values that are common in the organic rich sediments of the Hamersley Basin. The samples exhibit positive sulfur MIF values and can be separated into two populations. One comprises an atmospheric mixing array {{similar to that of the}} overlying shallow water sediments, the other may be the result of multi-stage sulfur cycling, involving both oxidising and reducing processes and/or metabolisms. This trend is characterised by positive Δ 33 S and a range of δ 34 S values. Biological multi-stage carbon cycling, possibly involving methanogenesis, methanotrophy and anaerobic methane oxidation, may have lead to the strongly depleted organic and carbonate carbon isotopes, which occur in the same anaerobic deeper water sediments that contain evidence of multi-stage sulfur cycling and multiple sulfur sources...|$|E
40|$|The Buchans ore {{bodies of}} central Newfoundland {{represent}} {{some of the}} highest grade VMS deposits ever mined. These Kuroko-type deposits are also known for the well developed and preserved nature of the mechanically transported deposits. The deposits are hosted in Cambro-Ordovician, dominantly calc-alkaline, bimodal volcanic and epiclastic sequences of the Notre Dame Subzone, Newfoundland Appalachians. Stratigraphic relationships in this zone are complicated by extensively developed, brittledominated Silurian thrust faulting. Hydrothermal alteration of host rocks is a common feature of nearly all VMS deposits, and the recognition of these zones has been a key exploration tool. Alteration of host rocks has long been described to be spatially associated with the Buchans ore bodies, most notably with the larger in-situ deposits. This report represents a base-line study in which a complete documentation of the geochemical variance, in terms of both primary (igneous) and alteration effects, is presented from altered volcanic rocks {{in the vicinity of the}} Lucky Strike deposit (LSZ), the largest in-situ deposit in the Buchans camp. Packages of altered rocks also occur away from the immediate mining areas and constitute new targets for exploration. These zones, identified mostly by recent and previous drilling, represent untested targets and include the Powerhouse (PHZ), Woodmans Brook (WBZ) and Airport (APZ) alteration zones, as well as the Middle Branch alteration zone (MBZ), which represents a more distal alteration facies related to Buchans ore-formation. Data from each of these zones were compared to those from the LSZ in order to evaluate their relative propectivity. Derived litho geochemical data served two functions: (i) to define primary (igneous) trends and (ii) secondary alteration trends. Primary trends were established using immobile, or conservative, elements (i. e., HFSE, REE, Th, Ti 0 ₂, Al₂ 0 ₃, P₂ 0 ₅). From these, altered volcanic rocks were interpreted in terms of composition (e. g., basalt - rhyodacite) and magmatic affinity (e. g., calc-alkaline vs. tholeiitic). The information suggests that bimodality is a common feature of all zones, with most rocks plotting as either basalt/andesite or dacite (or rhyodacite); andesitic senso stricto compositions are rare. Magmatic affinities are more varied and complex, but indicate that all units are arc volcanic sequences. Rocks from the LSZ/MBZ represent a transitional to calc-alkalic sequence, however, a slight shift in key geochemical discriminants occurs between the foot-wall to the hanging-wall. Specifically, mafic and felsic lavas of the foot-wall are of transitional (or mildly calc-alkaline) affinity whereas the hanging-wall rocks are relatively more strongly calc-alkaline as indicated by enriched LREE/HREE and higher ZrN, NbN and other ratios in the latter. The geochemical variations also serve as a means to separate the units (at least the felsic rocks) into hanging-wall and foot-wall sequences, therefore providing a valuable exploration tool. Volcanic rocks from the WBZ/PHZ (and probably the APZ) are more typical of tholeiitic to transitional suites, yielding flatter mantlenormalized REE patterns and lower ZrN ratios. Thus, the relationships between the immediate mining area (represented by LSZ/MBZ) and the Buchans East (PHZ/WBZ) and the APZ are uncertain. Host rocks for all zones consist of mafic to felsic volcanic rocks, though the proportion of pyroclastic and epiclastic rocks, is greatest at the LSZ. Phenocryst assemblages and textures are common in all zones, with minor exceptions, and are not useful for discrimination purposes. Felsic rocks from all zones are dominated by sericiteclay+/- silica alteration, whereas mafic rocks are dominated by chlorite- quartz- sericite alteration. Pyrite is ubiquitous in all moderately altered rocks and minor associated base metal sulphides occur locally. The exception is at Lucky Strike, where stockwork quartzveining contains abundant base-metal mineralization and barite. Rocks completely comprised of chlorite (chloritite) also occur in the LSZ foot-wall. In addition, K-feldspar alteration occurs in felsic volcanic rocks at the MBZ associated with Zn-Pb-Ba and, notably, without chlorite. This zone represents a peripheral, but proximal, zone of alteration induced by lower temperature hydrothermal fluids, presumably with little influence from seawater. Alteration geochemistry was interpreted from raw data as well as from mass balanced (recalculated) data derived from immobile element pairs. The data from the LSZ/MBZ indicate a range in the degree of alteration from only minor to severe modification of precursor compositions. Ba tends to show a strong positive correlation with K₂ 0, although most Ba occurs as barite. With respect to mass changes, Al₂ 0 ₃, Ti 0 ₂ and P₂ 0 ₅ were shown to be immobile. Nearly all rocks <b>display</b> <b>mass</b> loss of Na₂O, CaO, and Sr reflecting feldspar destruction. These trends are usually mirrored by K₂ 0 -Rb and MgO addition, indicating sericitic and chloritic alteration, respectively. More substantial gains ofK₂ 0 often occur in rocks with K-feldspar alteration, whereas a few samples also displayed excessive MgO enrichment and represent chloritites. Fe₂ 0 ₃ indicates both chlorite and sulphide formation. Si 0 ₂ addition is almost always the case for the altered mafic rocks as silica often infills amygdules and replaces the finer tuffaceous material. The felsic rocks display more variability in Si 0 ₂. Silicic, sericitic and chloritic alteration trends were observed from the other zones, but not K-feldspar, chloritite, or barite. Microprobe analysis of chlorites, sericites and carbonates indicate: (i) sericites from all zones are defined as muscovite and are not phengitic; (ii) at the LSZ, chlorites ranged from Fe-Mg chlorites (pycnochlorite) to Mg-rich chlorite (penninite), with the latter occurring in the stockwork zone and more proximal alteration facies; (iii) chlorites from the WBZ were typical of those from the more distal alteration facies of the LSZ, plotting as ripidolite to pycnochlorite; (iv) conversely, chlorite from the PHZ plot with Mg-Al-rich compositions (chlinochlore to penninite); and (v) carbonate species from each zone are also varied, with calcite occurring in each zone, in addition to dolomite and ankerite in the PHZ and WBZ, respectively. Lead isotope ratios for galena separates from the different various zones, when combined with data from older studies, tend to cluster into four distinctive fields. Overall, the data plot on a broad mixing line and indicate evolution in a relatively low-μ environment. Data from sulphide stringers in altered MBZ rocks, as well as from clastic sulphides (Sandfill prospect), plot in the Buchans ore field, as do the data for galena from altered rocks in the APZ. Samples from the Buchans East area are even more primitive than the Buchans ores, with lead from the PHZ plotting with the Connel Option prospect and data from the WBZ matching that of the Skidder prospect. A sample from a newly discovered debris flow-type sulphide occurrence (Middle Branch East) yields lead isotope ratios that are slightly more radiogenic than Buchans and plot with the Mary March alteration zone. Data within each cluster are interpreted to represent derivation from individual hydrothermal systems in which metals were derived from a common source...|$|E
