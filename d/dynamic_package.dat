5000|$|<b>Dynamic</b> <b>packaging</b> is {{a method}} used in package holiday bookings to enable {{consumers}} {{to build their own}} package of flights, accommodation, and car rental instead of purchasing a pre-defined <b>package.</b> <b>Dynamic</b> <b>packages</b> differ from traditional package tours in that the pricing is always based on current availability, escorted group tours are rarely included, and trip-specific add-ons such as airport parking and show tickets are often available. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>packages</b> are similar in that often the air, hotel, and car rates are available only as part of a package or only from a specific seller. The term [...] "dynamic packaging" [...] is often used incorrectly to describe the less sophisticated process of interchanging various travel components within a package, however, this practice is more accurately described as [...] "dynamic bundling".

50|$|Contextualism as a {{paradigm}} is Baltes’ idea that three systems of biological and environmental influence {{work together to}} influence development: age-graded, history-graded, and nonnormative influences. Baltes wrote that these three influences operate throughout the life course, their effects accumulate with time, and, as a <b>dynamic</b> <b>package,</b> {{they are responsible for}} how lives develop. While Baltes was referring to influences {{over the course of a}} lifetime, this perspective nonetheless is highly applicable to the study of adolescent development. Age-graded influences are those biological and environmental factors that have a strong correlation with chronological age. Adolescence is a time of much “biological maturation and age-graded socialization events.” History-graded influences are biological determinants that are associated with a specific time period that define the broader bio-cultural context in which an individual develops. This is similar to the perspective of historical embeddedness, which has been shown earlier in the paper to pertain heavily to the study of adolescent development. Nonnormative influences are unpredictable and not tied to a certain developmental time, personally or historically. They are the unique experiences of an individual, whether biological or environment, that shape the development process. This certainly applies to adolescent development as these experiences could occur in the adolescent time period, however they are just as likely to occur in any other period of development. The most important aspect of the perspective of contextualism as {{a paradigm}} is that the three systems of influence work together to influence development. Concerning adolescent development, the age-graded influences would help to explain the similarities within a cohort, the history-graded influences would help to explain the differences between cohorts, and the nonnormative influences would explain the idiosyncrasies of each adolescents individual development. When all influences are considered together, it lends to a broader explanation of an adolescent’s development.|$|E

If inlet and outlet channels are eliminated, diodicity can be increased by 2.

40|$|The tourism {{industry}} {{is characterized by}} its heterogeneity and by a high volume of online transactions. Small tourist operators develop their own booking systems {{more and more to}} avoid paying commissions to the big tourist information system owners. Due to this fact, many new sources of tourist information are appearing in the Internet and the escalation of these new sources makes the planning of holidays more complex to the tourists. The development of a system that enables the integration of different sources becomes an urgent necessity when it comes to help tourists plan their holidays {{and at the same time}} gives means to the tourist operators to develop new marketing strategies. One of them is most certainly the development of <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Packaging.</b> <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Packaging</b> allows the tourist or the agent to freely choose the products that will compose a holiday package.

50|$|Opaque pricing of <b>dynamic</b> <b>packages</b> {{hide the}} price of the {{included}} components. This has several benefits.

With <b>dynamic</b> <b>packaging,</b> the customer is not presented with the room price, only the overall package price, so hotels typically allow the wholesaler to discount the (hidden) price of the hotel more.|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} Quantum mechanics/Molecular Mechanics–Poisson-Boltzmann/ Surface Area (QM/MM-PB/SA) method to {{calculate}} the binding free energy of c-Abl human tyrosine kinase by combining the QM and MM principles where the ligand is treated quantum mechanically {{and the rest of}} the receptor by classical molecular mechanics. To study the role of entropy and the flexibility of the protein ligand complex in a solvated environment, molecular dynamics calculations are performed using a hybrid QM/MM approach. This work shows that the results of the QM/MM approach are strongly correlated with the binding affinity. The QM/MM interaction energy in our reported study confirms the importance of electronic and polarization contributions, which are often neglected in classical MM-PB/SA calculations. Moreover, a comparison of semi-empirical methods like DFTB-SCC, PM 3, MNDO, MNDO-PDDG, and PDDG-PM 3 is also performed. The results of the study show that the implementation of a DFTB-SCC semi-empirical Hamiltonian that is derived from DFT gives better results than other methods.

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{high levels of}} RNA {{polymerase}} II transcription on mitotic recombination was examined using lys 2 recombination substrates positioned on nonhomologous chromosomes. Substrates were used that could produce Lys 1 recombinants by either a simple (noncrossover) gene conversion event or a crossover-associated recombination event, by only a simple gene conversion event, or by only a crossover event. Transcription of the lys 2 substrates was regulated by the highly inducible GAL 1 - 10 promoter or the low-level LYS 2 promoter, with GAL 1 - 10 promoter activity being controlled by {{the presence or absence}} of the Gal 80 p negative regulatory protein. Transcription was found to stimulate recombination in all assays used, but the level of stimulation varied depending on whether only one or both substrates were highly transcribed. In addition, there was an asymmetry in the types of recombination events observed when one substrate versus the other was highly transcribed. Finally, the lys 2 substrates were positioned as direct repeats on the same chromosome and were found to exhibit a different recombinational response to high levels of transcription from that exhibited by the repeats on nonhomologous chromosomes. The relevance of these results to the mechanisms of transcription-associated recombination are discussed.

40|$|Abstract: Chilean Needle Grass {{has been}} {{described}} as being potentially the worst environmental weed of native grasslands in South-eastern Australia and its potential distribution has been estimated to be more than 41 million ha. This research involves experiments as well as modeling and simulation of the flow and spreading of Chilean Needle Grass during slashing. Fluent, Computational Fluid <b>Dynamic</b> <b>package</b> (CFD) is employed to investigate the inherent complexities of the slashing process using a virtual slasher model and simulating the slashing process and spreading of Chilean Needle Grass involving also blade mechanics. This approach aims to develop new slasher designs capable of reducing Chilean Needle Grass spread. High accuracy of the simulations is realized through validation with experimental data. Tuft method and pressure profile measurements were performed in the wind tunnel, these experiments resulting in data about the flow pressure patterns inside the slasher deck unit. The real slashing process of Chilean Needle Grass was performed in the field, the slashing action was visualized using dyes and digital video filming while the spreading of the slashed grass was carefully mapped. These experiments helped achieve a reliable CAD-CFD slasher model, which appears to be the most effective method of analyzing the slashing process to date. The main benefit of the developed computational models is in greatly reduced trial time and the possibility of investigating a wide range of data including the effect of different slasher geometries on the spreading levels...|$|E
40|$|Flow separations {{occur in}} various {{engineering}} applications. Computational simulation by using standard k-ε turbulence model {{was performed to}} investigate numerically the characteristic of backward-facing step flow in a concentric configuration. This research {{is focused on the}} variation of Reynolds number, heat flux and step height in a fully developed turbulent air flow. The design consists of entrance tube, inner and outer tubes at the test section. The inner tube is placed along the entrance tube at the test section with an outer tube to form annular conduit. The entrance tube diameter was varied to create step height, s of 18. 5 mm. The Reynolds number was set between 17050 and 44545 and heat flux was set between 719 W/m 2 and 2098 W/m 2 respectively. It is observed that the higher Reynolds number with step flow contribute to the enhancement of heat transfer. The reattachment point for q= 719 W/m 2 is observed at 0. 542 m, which is the minimum surface temperature. The experimental data shows slightly lower distribution of surface temperature compared to simulation data. As for the same case in experimental result, the minimum surface temperature is obtained at 0. 55 m. The difference between numerical and experimental result is 0. 008 m. Finally, it can be inferred that utilizing the computational fluid <b>dynamic</b> <b>package</b> software, agreeable results could be obtained for the present research.
