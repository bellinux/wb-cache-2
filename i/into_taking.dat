Quill's group, now known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, have their criminal records expunged, and Quill learns that he is only half-human, his father being part of an ancient, unknown species.

5|$|Ship {{camouflage}} {{was used}} in earnest by the British Admiralty in the First World War. The marine artist Norman Wilkinson led research into dazzle camouflage, resulting in the painting of thousands of British and later American ships in dazzle patterns. He intended it not to make ships invisible, nor even to cause the enemy to miss his shot, but to deceive him <b>into</b> <b>taking</b> up a poor firing position. In the Second World War, dazzle was revisited by the Royal Navy and the United States Navy, and applied to a limited extent by other navies.|$|E
5|$|Some larvae, {{especially}} those of the Lycaenidae, form mutual associations with ants.

5|$|The marine {{artist and}} Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve officer Norman Wilkinson, agreed with Kerr that dazzle's aim was {{confusion}} rather than concealment, but disagreed about {{the type of}} confusion to be sown in the enemy's mind. What Wilkinson {{wanted to do was}} to make it difficult for an enemy to estimate a ship's type, size, speed, and heading, and thereby confuse enemy ship commanders <b>into</b> <b>taking</b> mistaken or poor firing positions. An observer would find it difficult to know exactly whether the stern or the bow was in view; and it would be correspondingly difficult to estimate whether the observed vessel was moving towards or away from the observer's position.|$|E

In the present, Chandler becomes upset after learning that he had lost his toe because he called Monica fat, and angrily leaves. When Monica comes by his apartment seeking his forgiveness by putting a turkey on her head, he inadvertently tells her he loves {{her for the first time}} in their relationship.

Together with Tip the Penguin and Dash the Walrus she goes to Atlantica and succeeds in acquiring the trident. Ariel arrives as they return with it to Morgana, and tries to persuade Melody to give back the trident. Morgana captures Ariel, tightly wrapping her tentacle around Ariel's mouth and body.

5|$|Despite the {{upheaval}} on shore, {{the arrival of}} the British blockade squadron provoked Renaud <b>into</b> <b>taking</b> action. Although the defences of Île de France were well prepared under Malartic's orders, food supplies were running low, with only rice still available in quantity. The potential for famine and consequent social unrest among the slave population was severe and Renaud sailed immediately to intercept Centurion and Diomede. The French squadron comprised the 40-gun frigate Cybèle under Captain Pierre Tréhouart, the 36-gun Prudente under Renaud, and the 14-gun brig Coureur under lieutenant de vaisseau Garaud. The 20-gun privateer corvettes Jean-Bart and Rosalie, as well as the aviso Sans-Culotte, accompanied the two frigates. The ships' crews were heavily augmented by volunteers, including a young Robert Surcouf on Cybèle, as well as a detachment of soldiers.|$|E

40|$|The Chicago School of Symbolic Interactionism (one {{trend of}} the Chicago Renaissance) {{represented}} by the works of Herbert Blumer，has been seen to be major alternative to functionalism and social system theory in American sociology. In addition，this approach also has been important in sociology as a critique of positivism. According to Blumer，from the standpoint of Symbolic Interactionism，the human society has {{to be recognized as}} dynamic by nature. By the way，what 2 ̆ 7 s the human society in his theory? To summarize his theory about this，it can be said as follows. In dyadic model of the actor and the other，both these two persons take each other <b>into</b> account. <b>Taking</b> another person <b>into</b> account means perceiving，defining and judging the other person and his/her action through self interaction. The fact that each of the two persons is <b>taking</b> the other <b>into</b> account is notable. For, it means that each two persons are brought into a relation of subject to subject and necessarily have to do <b>taking</b> <b>into</b> account of <b>taking</b> <b>into</b> account. According to Blumer，this <b>taking</b> <b>into</b> account of <b>taking</b> <b>into</b> account intertwines the actions of both into what he calls the joint action which is grasped as constituting human society in his theory. Then，human society in his theory means the association of various joint actions. In this article，we try to clarify the reason why the human society (the association of various joint actions) has to be recognized as dynamic by nature in Blumer 2 ̆ 7 s theory. In particular，try to do this in close relation to his concept self interaction. 98 Pに欧文要旨...|$|R
