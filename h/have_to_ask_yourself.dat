500|$|Childress and Bowyer {{were both}} {{upset with the}} {{penalties}} and almost immediately announced plans to appeal. Bowyer argued the penalties to be too severe, saying, [...] "I don't think the penalty fits the crime. Sixty-thousandths of an inch, folks. Grab a quarter out of your pocket. Less than the thickness of that quarter right there is worth a 150-point fine?" [...] He also argued that his car could have been damaged slightly after the race as his car was pushed by a wrecker after it {{ran out of gas}} on its way to victory lane. [...] "Is it possible that a two-ton wrecker could bend the quarter-panel 60-thousandths of an inch? You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>yourself</b> that." [...] The team lost the initial appeal, forcing them to make a final appeal to NASCAR National Commissioner John Middlebrook. As a result of the final appeal, Wilson's fine was reduced to $100,000 while he and Haney's suspensions were reduced from six to four races (they were allowed to work with the team during the appeal process); however, the points penalty administered to Bowyer and his team was upheld.|$|E
500|$|Season four began {{expanding}} on {{the series}} long story arc of Lex's feelings for Lana. Though the seeds were {{planted in the}} second episode of the first season, {{it was not until}} season four that Lex began to show more of his true feelings. According to Gough, not only was Lex trying to protect Lana from Jason Teague (Jensen Ackles), Lana's boyfriend who was also after the stones of knowledge, but he was also trying to get Jason out of the picture completely so he could have Lana for himself. Writer Darren Swimmer questioned Lex's motives from earlier seasons: [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>yourself,</b> in the words of Lex Luthor himself: Why would some billionaire want to be bailing out this girl and buying her a coffee house to begin with? What's that all about?" [...] Writer Todd Slavkin described season five as [...] "the darkening of Lex Luthor". By the time [...] "Aqua" [...] came around, Lex had removed the gloves, as there is no friendship with Clark that he needed to worry about, and his dark side began to show its face. Season five also saw Lex's hunger for power begin to develop, as he campaigned for a Kansas senate seat. It was the events of [...] "Lexmas" [...] that drove Lex to continue his pursuit of ultimate power. In [...] "Lexmas", Lex is shot and he gets a chance to live a life where he is married to Lana and he no longer on a quest for power. In this alternate reality, without all the power and money that he had originally had, Lex is unable to save Lana, who dies after giving birth to their second child. It is here that Lex decided that he would always [...] "go for the prize".|$|E

60|$|On the hot dusty roads near seaport {{towns and}} great rivers, behold the {{tramping}} Soldier. And {{if you should}} happen never <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>asked</b> <b>yourself</b> whether his uniform is suited to his work, perhaps the poor fellow's appearance as he comes distressfully towards you, with his absurdly tight jacket unbuttoned, his neck-gear in his hand, and his legs well chafed by his trousers of baize, may suggest the personal inquiry, how you think YOU would like it. Much better the tramping Sailor, although his cloth is somewhat too thick for land service. But, why the tramping merchant-mate should put on a black velvet waistcoat, for a chalky country in the dog- days, {{is one of the}} great secrets of nature that will never be discovered.|$|R
2500|$|One critic, Allegheny County Democratic Chairman Jim Burn, {{said that}} ”Her record speaks for itself. I've seen {{a long line}} of Democrats and {{mistakes}} aren't made based on party affiliation but I haven't seen anybody from the other side going though that system." [...] Burn pointed to the fact that Buchanan’s Office refused to investigate former Republican Senator Rick Santorum, who got a tuition reimbursement for his children by claiming a Penn Hills, Pennsylvania residency while his family spent most of its time in Virginia, as an example of an alleged double standard. [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>yourself</b> the misrepresentations of a Republican such as Rick Santorum made about his alleged residency in Penn Hills were significant," [...] said Burn.|$|E

60|$|These three {{examples}} are violently marked ones; but, in preparing {{to draw any}} object, you will find that, practically, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>yourself,</b> Shall I aim at the color of it, the light of it, or the lines of it? You can't have all three; you can't even have any two out of the three in equal strength. The best art, indeed, comes so near nature as in a measure to unite all. But the best is not, and cannot be, as good as nature; and the mode of its deficiency is that it must lose some of the color, some of the light, {{or some of the}} delineation. And in consequence, there is one great school which says, We will have the color, and as much light and delineation as are consistent with it. Another which says, We will have shade, and as much color and delineation as are consistent with it. The third, We will have delineation, and as much color and shade as are consistent with it.|$|E
40|$|How many of {{you reading}} this now have seen {{children}} pausing, sitting back, sighing, waving their arms around and generally appearing to be stuck for words? <b>Have</b> you stopped <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>yourself</b> what this means? What are children {{trying to tell us}} when they can’t find the words that they need? Children’s gestures are valuable in informing teaching practice and how we go about assessing children’s work in science. The importance of children’s errors, misconceptions and preconceptions in science education has become well established through a wide body of research conducted since the 1970 s (for example see Vosniadou, 2008, for a recent review). In the UK, the highly influential Children’s Learning In Science (CLIS, 1987) and Science Processes and Concept Exploration (SPACE, 1989 – 1998) projects reminded us not only that children’s ideas often differ from those of scientists or what is taught in school, but that these can strongly influence the direction of future learning...|$|R

My good friends, what does God require of you? [...] "To do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God." [...] I told you He {{required}} of you first to trust in Him at all hours, in all weathers. This is the next thing which He requires of you--To do justly, to cheat no man, not in the price of a pilchard; to love mercy; to love your neighbours, as Christ loved you; to help your neighbours, as Christ helped you and all mankind, by dying to save you; and as Christ has helped you, night after night, when you might have been buried in the waves, if Christ had not prayed for you that you might <b>have</b> time <b>to</b> repent, and bring forth fruits fit for repentance. To love mercy; to forgive every man who hurts you, for they are all Christian men and your brothers. Christ loved every one! Why should not you? If your wife or friend loved anything, you would be kind to it for their sakes; and so, if you really love God, and are thankful to Him for all His mercy and kindness, you will love every man you meet, for God's sake, who loved them and gave His Son for them.|$|R
