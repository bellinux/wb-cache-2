500|$|Often {{credited}} with using fighting and intimidation as a tactic, Shero never coached players to fight. He valued team toughness {{and insisted that}} players take the body and follow through with their checks. When it came to fighting Shero {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "I swear I have never told a player to attack another player. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> my players if they ever hear me saying something like this, they can break a stick over my skull. I ask only that they play aggressively." [...] In an interview in the HBO documentary Broad Street Bullies Shero states that he had a team that liked fighting so he let them fight. Demonstrating his personal coaching philosophy that [...] "You have to learn to win with what you got or you don't win at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Although no {{materials}} {{appear to}} exist specifically addressing {{the composition of}} [...] "The Princess and the Pea", Andersen does speak to {{the writing of the}} first four tales of 1835 of which [...] "The Princess on the Pea" [...] is one. New Year's Day 1835, Andersen wrote to a friend: [...] "I am now starting on some 'fairy tales for children.' I am going to win over future generations, you may want to know", and, in a letter dated February 1835 he wrote to the poet, Bernhard Severin Ingemann: [...] "I have started some 'Fairy Tales Told for Children' and believe I have succeeded. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> a couple of tales which as a child I was happy about, and which I do not believe are known, and have written them exactly the way I would tell them to a child." [...] Andersen had finished the tales by March 1835 and told Admiral Wulff's daughter, Henriette: [...] "I have also written some fairy tales for children; Ørsted says about them that if The Improvisatore makes me famous then these will make me immortal, for they are the most perfect things I have written; but I myself do not think so." [...] On 26March, he observed that [...] " [...] will be published in April, and people will say: the work of my immortality! Of course I shan't enjoy the experience in this world." ...|$|E

60|$|It was {{a strange}} manner in which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> my love. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> roared my burning words of passion through a speaking-trumpet, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> them not to Bertha herself, but to Mary Phillips. But the manner was of no importance. Bertha now knew that I loved her. That was {{everything}} to me.|$|R
6000|$|And when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> her of Niflheim and Muspell, of {{the birth}} of the giant Ymir from the snowflakes, of the cow Andhumbla, and of Fenrir and Loki and the frozen Jotuns--as I say, when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> her of all this, and of Thor and Odin and our own Valhalla, she clapped her hands and cried out, with {{sparkling}} eyes: ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I know my Southern sisters {{well enough}} {{to believe that they}} will not much longer rest tamely under the {{influence}} of [...] this damning curse. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> them plainly of the evil. The remedy is in their hands"- ...|$|E
2500|$|... "As <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you before, {{the thing}} needed in this Age is work (karma). In every Age people have reached {{salvation}} through {{different types of}} action and sadhana (spiritual discipline), but in this Age one can reach liberation only through hard work. I want real, practical human beings and only he is a true human being who lives in accordance with this Age. We need not consider religion or caste, but look only to hard work." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Michael Stewart, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, in a {{reply to}} a {{question}} in Parliament, 9 December 1969: [...] "As I have explained before, there is reference, in the vital United Nations Security Council Resolution, both to withdrawal from territories and to secure and recognized boundaries. As <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> the House previously, we believe that these two things should be read concurrently and that the omission of the word 'all' before the word 'territories' is deliberate." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Fox News in late July 2016, Clinton stated [...] "Director Comey said my answers were truthful, and what I've said is consistent with what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> the American people, that there were decisions discussed and made to classify retroactively certain of the emails." [...] The Washington Post awarded Clinton four [...] "Pinocchios", its worst rating, for her statement saying [...] "While Comey did say {{there was no evidence}} she lied to the FBI, that {{is not the same as}} saying she told the truth to the American public." ...|$|E
2500|$|My father, after I had {{finished}} saying what I have repeated above, {{looked at me}} a moment, raised his hand above his head and slowly said, with tears glistening in his eyes: [...] "My son, I can swear before high heaven that what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you {{about the origin of}} [...] is true. Your mother and sister, Mrs. Athalia Robinson, were present when that book was handed to me in Mentor, Ohio, and all I ever knew about the origin of [...] was what Parley P.

2500|$|The novel {{caused an}} uproar in the {{community}} it portrayed; it {{was taken off the}} shelves of the Oscar Wilde Memorial Bookstore — New York's only gay bookstore - and Kramer was banned from the grocery store near his home on Fire Island. Reviewers found it difficult to believe that Kramer's accounts of gay relationships were accurate; both the gay and mainstream press panned the book. On the reception of the novel Kramer says, [...] "The straight world thought I was repulsive, and the gay world treated me like a traitor. People would literally turn their back when I walked by. You know what my real crime was? I put the truth in writing. That's what I do: <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> the fucking truth to everyone I have ever met." [...] Faggots, however, became one of the best-selling gay novels of all time. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061126174240/http://www.glbthistorymonth.com/glbthistorymonth/bio.cfm?LeaderID=25 |archivedate=November 26, 2006 }} ...|$|E

2500|$|This theory {{contradicts the}} {{testimony}} of Rigdon to his son John, just prior to his death and long after he had ceased an affiliation {{with any of the}} sects of Mormonism: [...] "My father, after I had finished saying what I have repeated above, looked at me a moment, raised his hand above his head and slowly said, with tears glistening in his eyes: 'My son, I can swear before high heaven that what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you about the origin of [...] is true.

2500|$|... "So {{great is}} the {{importance}} and so supreme is the authority of these assemblies that once `Abdu'l-Bahá after having himself and in his own handwriting corrected the translation made into Arabic of the Ishraqat (the Effulgences) by Sheikh Faraj, a Kurdish friend from Cairo, directed him in a Tablet to submit the above-named translation to the Spiritual Assembly of Cairo, that he may seek from them before publication their approval and consent. These are His very words in that Tablet: — 'His honour, Sheikh Faraju'llah, has here rendered into Arabic with greatest care the Ishraqat and yet <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> him that he must submit his version to the Spiritual Assembly of Egypt, and I have conditioned its publication upon {{the approval of the}} above-named Assembly. This is so that things may be arranged in an orderly manner, for should it not be so any one may translate a certain Tablet and print and circulate it on his own account. Even a non-believer might undertake such work, and thus cause confusion and disorder. If it be conditioned, however, upon the approval of the Spiritual Assembly, a translation prepared, printed and circulated by a non-believer will have no recognition whatever.' ...|$|E

2500|$|In his autobiography, Twain writes further of Captain Sellers' use of [...] "Mark Twain": I was a cub pilot on the Mississippi River then, {{and one day}} I wrote a {{rude and}} crude satire which was leveled at Captain Isaiah Sellers, the oldest {{steamboat}} pilot on the Mississippi River, and the most respected, esteemed, and revered. For many years he had occasionally written brief paragraphs concerning {{the river and the}} changes which it had undergone under his observation during fifty years, and had signed these paragraphs [...] "Mark Twain" [...] and published them in the St. Louis and New Orleans journals. In my satire I made rude game of his reminiscences. It was a shabby poor performance, but I didn't know it, and the pilots didn't know it. The pilots thought it was brilliant. They were jealous of Sellers, because when the gray-heads among them pleased their vanity by detailing in the hearing of the younger craftsmen marvels which they had seen in the long ago on the river, Sellers was always likely to step in at the psychological moment and snuff them out with wonders of his own which made their small marvels look pale and sick. However, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> all about this in [...] "Old Times on the Mississippi." [...] The pilots handed my extravagant satire to a river reporter, and it was published in the New Orleans True Delta. That poor old Captain Sellers was deeply wounded. He had never been held up to ridicule before; he was sensitive, and he never got over the hurt which I had wantonly and stupidly inflicted upon his dignity. I was proud of my performance for a while, and considered it quite wonderful, but I have changed my opinion of it long ago. Sellers never published another paragraph nor ever used his nom de guerre again.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have told}} you," [...] Rice continued, [...] "of Drexley and of poor young Silverton. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> {{you that there}} have been many others. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> you that she even tried to do you ill that you might be {{numbered}} amongst her victims. Now I tell you what as yet <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>told</b> no man. I, too, was once the most pitiful of her slaves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lazzaro," [...] she cried, when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>told</b> her of my intention, [...] "do you, too, desert me? And <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{ever held}} you my best of friends." ...|$|R
