5|$|Andrew Prine, {{who played}} Norman Ramsey, wrote the last {{fifth of the}} film because it had no ending. Both Ben Johnson and he were hung over while filming the train scene after partying the night before. During the rain scene with Ramsey, a snake made its way on the set. Crew members were yelling at Andrew {{that it was a}} moccasin, but Prine wanted to finish his scene without reshooting, so the crew killed the snake afterwards. The last shot of the film where the killer is seen {{standing}} <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> movie theater was Pierce's wife's idea.|$|E
5|$|The Saint Lucia Olympic Committee sent President Richard Peterkin, Minister of Youth and Sports Lenard Montoute, Chief de Mission Alfred Emmanuel, Coach Henry Bailey, and Coach Karen Beaubrun to Beijing {{alongside}} the four-person athletic delegation.

25|$|On September 30, 2012, a 19-year-old man {{fell from}} the Venom Drop water slide. According to a {{spokesperson}} for the water park, the man cut <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> slide, fought through the lifeguards, and jumped onto the slide head-first. The man tumbled onto the slide and slipped over the edge, falling 60 feet onto a fence below the slide tower. The local sheriff's office reported that the man was transported to an area hospital with life-threatening injuries.|$|E
25|$|Raymond J. Place first aroused the {{suspicion}} {{of law enforcement}} officers as he was standing <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Miami airport waiting to buy a ticket to New York's LaGuardia Airport. The officers approached {{him on his way}} to the gate and asked him for identification. Place also agreed to let the officers search the luggage he had checked, but they declined to do so in light of the flight's imminent departure. Discrepancies between the two luggage tags on Place's two suitcases further aroused the officers' suspicions, and they confirmed that the addresses were false. The Miami officers alerted DEA agents at LaGuardia to their suspicions about Place.|$|E
25|$|While being {{deported}} to the U.S., Abagnale escaped from a British VC-10 airliner {{as it was}} turning onto a taxiway at New York's JFK International Airport. Under cover of night, he scaled a nearby fence and hailed a cab to Grand Central Terminal. After stopping in The Bronx to change clothes {{and pick up a}} set of keys to a Montreal bank safe deposit box containing $20,000, Abagnale caught a train to Montreal's Dorval airport to purchase a ticket to São Paulo, Brazil. After a close call at a Mac's Milk, he was apprehended by a constable of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police while standing <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> ticket counter. Abagnale was subsequently handed over to the U.S. Border Patrol.|$|E

25|$|At around 1:10p.m., Bryant got <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> toll {{booth at}} the {{entrance}} to the historic site. Upon getting close to the toll booth, he left the line and moved to the back again. Eventually getting to the front of the line, he claimed someone had almost reversed into him. He paid the entry fee and proceeded to park near the Broad Arrow Café, near the water's edge. The site security manager told him to park with the other cars because that area was reserved for camper-vans and the car park was very busy that day. Bryant moved his car to another area and sat in his car for a few minutes. He then moved his car back near the water, outside the café. The security manager saw him go up to the café carrying a large bag and a video camera, but ignored him.|$|E
25|$|Before the Confederates could {{approach}} Dagwell and his men, Major Remington {{appeared with}} the rest of the detachment. When informed of the situation, Remington did not try to flee but ordered his men <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> crest of the hill where Dagwell had viewed the 2,000-man Confederate force. Meanwhile, Stuart had heard about the encounter with his staff officers and ordered Brigadier General Wade Hampton III to bring up the lead regiment quickly to meet the threat. The advance unit of the Confederates, the 1st North Carolina Cavalry, then came over the hill and moved to within 30 yards of the Union line but did not move further forward despite orders which Dagwell could hear. When the Union troops did not surrender after about 15 seconds, the opposing forces began to shoot at each other.|$|E
500|$|Blake however did {{not follow}} Beresford's orders; he still {{believed}} that the French attack would come at his front. Keeping his forward line in position, he instead moved four battalions from Zayas's division to form his new southern-facing front. [...] Zayas deployed these battalions, from the Spanish second line, in two groups. Two battalions of Spanish Guards were formed up, <b>in</b> <b>line,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of a steep incline while the remaining two formed close columns behind them; a single battery of Spanish artillery supported the whole position.|$|E

500|$|After {{returning}} from the porn shop, Peter is shown watching an episode of Blind Justice. [...] The lawyer who attempts to sue Carter is forced into a battle with a rancor in a scene that mirrors Luke Skywalker's fight with the Rancor in the 1983 film Return of the Jedi. When Peter and Carter {{are trying to make}} money, they start their own sitcom called Quahog Creek, a ripoff of WB's Dawson's Creek. The theme song [...] "I Don't Want to Wait" [...] uses misinterpreted lyrics of the actual theme song performed by Paula Cole. While Peter and Carter try to steal money from Lois' purse, Peter balances on a unicycle and hums Aram Khachaturian's [...] "Sabre Dance". When waiting <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> movies, Peter tells Carter about a new movie, The Picnic, starring Jude Law and Renée Zellweger. The song used is [...] "Roll to Me", by Del Amitri.|$|E
500|$|Bart and Lisa start a {{lemonade}} stand, but it {{is quickly}} closed due to them not having a vending permit. They get <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> licensing bureau, {{only to find that}} the long line is standing still due to the clerk doing a crossword puzzle. Impatient, Lisa completes the puzzle herself, only to find herself addicted to the puzzles. Eventually, she becomes so obsessed with them that Superintendent Chalmers hands her a pamphlet for the Crossword City Tournament. Meanwhile, at Moe's, Edna Krabappel offers to buy a beer for anyone who breaks up with Principal Skinner for her. Homer ends their relationship, and decides to take a second job in which he helps break up romantic relationships. Grady, one of his old roommates, calls Homer and asks him to break up Grady's and his boyfriend's relationship because he found a new and [...] "better" [...] man in Duffman. Homer successfully manages to break up the couple. After making a good deal of money, he dreams that he is pestered by the [...] "ghosts" [...] of the jilted lovers and thus quits the trade.|$|E
500|$|Pre-orders were so {{high for}} the third-generation iPad that later orders were quoted {{shipping}} times of [...] "two to three weeks" [...] after the order was placed. Apple said that [...] "customer response to the new iPad has been off the charts and the quantity available for pre-order has been purchased." [...] Despite the delayed shipping, many users chose to purchase the iPad online instead of waiting <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Apple Store. Approximately 750 people waited outside the Fifth Avenue Apple Store in New York City for the product's release. According to an Apple press release, three million units were sold {{in the first three}} days. The iPad was purchased mainly by a younger, male demographic. Most of the buyers were either [...] "die-hard Apple fans" [...] or had previously purchased an iPad. An Apple retailer in Dayton, Ohio, claimed that the demand for the tablet was [...] "chaotic" [...] and claimed that its launch was [...] "drastically more significant than the iPad 2 launch." [...] By Q2 of 2012, Apple would hit an all-time high, claiming 69.6 percent of the global tablet market.|$|E

25|$|By {{daylight}} Chaytor's Force was advancing {{across the}} undulating plateau on roads and tracks {{in a landscape}} which restricted movement. All off-road movement was virtually impossible because the wet and boggy terrain had recently been ploughed and planted with first shoots starting to appear. The terrain favoured defence with stones which had been gathered from the fields and piled up in heaps or laid out <b>in</b> <b>lines</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fields edges, providing good cover for concealed enemy riflemen and machine guns. The wadis in the region were steep sided making crossing by horses difficult; the Wadi Amman could not be crossed except {{in one or two}} places.|$|R
500|$|At 06:00 on 6 February Duckworth's scouts sighted the French, observing two frigates, five {{ships of}} the line and one large {{merchant}} ship anchored <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> entrance to Santo Domingo. Leissègues had reportedly issued orders for the squadron to sail for Jamaica, even though several of the French ships were not yet ready for sea, and two frigates were already under sail when the British arrived. Leissègues was not aboard Impérial; he and a number of his officers were still conducting their business in the town and were therefore forced to join the squadron in small boats, which delayed the squadron. Several officers, possibly including Leissègues, did not reach their ships until after the engagement had begun. Recognising that his enemy was in a vulnerable position, Duckworth raised all sail in an effort to close with the French. Leissègues too recognised the danger his ships were in and ordered them to raise anchor and then to sail westwards along the coast in the direction of Nizao. Maintaining close formation, the French formed a line of battle, Captain Pierre-Elie Garreau in Alexandre leading, with Impérial, Diomède, Jupiter and Brave following. [...] The frigates and corvette took a position between the battle line and the shore. Duckworth was concerned that there might be other French forces to the west. He therefore angled his line of attack to pass across the front of the French line and signaled to his squadron to direct their fire at the front three ships: Alexandre, Impérial and Diomède.|$|E

Meal time can last 30 minutes or less, depending on how quickly the platoon gets <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> chow hall.
