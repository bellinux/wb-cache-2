40|$|To {{predict the}} effect of a <b>floating</b> {{viscoelastic}} <b>slab</b> on the propagation and attenuation of gravity waves, a theoretical linear model has been developed. The slab has been modeled as a Kelvin-Voigt model and the fluid is assumed to be ideal. For long and short wave theory a dispersion relation for gravity waves covered by a viscoelastic slab of infinite length has been derived. This dispersion relation has been used to compute the so-called transmission and reflection coefficients of a slab of finite length. The theoretically derived dispersion relation has been checked by tests on a slab made of butyl rubber and polystyrene. These tests have been carried out for regular waves in a wave flume having the dimensions of 20 * 0. 5 * 0. 6 meter. The slab had a thickness of 11. 5 mm and a length of 4. 27 meter. Using the measured wave heights, the transmission and reflection coefficients were calculated and compared with the theoretical values.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of vibrations transmitted by transport infrastructures, without increasing too much the construction cost, {{is going to}} be a very important issue to deal with. The most effective construction techniques used up to now are based on very complex and expensive solutions (such as <b>floating</b> <b>slabs)</b> and on the use of special and once again expensive materials (such as elastomeric mats). One of the possible innovative techniques is based on the use of hot mix asphalt in which a share of the traditional aggregates is substituted with rubber granulate (2 – 4 mm) produced using waste tyres. This material could be used as sub ballast layer in railway constructions and as binder or base layer in road construction. “Modified” hot mix asphalt results in lower elastic modulus and higher loss factor compared with the traditional one, it can be produced with the same machines and procedures resulting in comparable costs, as a consequence it can be regarded as a very promising material to be used in the traffic vibration control field. The prediction of the effectiveness of vibration damping systems is very complex due to the number of variables involved and to the complexity of their relationships. Simulation and thence the possibility of a low cost “try and error” approach becomes in this context an obvious answer to the problem, but once again the complexity of the systems, the peculiar dynamic behaviour of involved materials makes reliable models hard to be defined and calibrated. The proposed approach is based on the calibration of the materials behavioural models comparing real and simulated results of manageable and repeatable experiments (such as the complex modulus test or tests on multilayer systems).

An increase of slab mass is most effective to expand the vibration isolation range, whereas it has no obvious effect to enhance the vibration isolation efficiency.

To thoroughly investigate the issue, two main objectives are addressed: the development of a reliable WSN tailored for use in historic structures, and the implementation of the monitoring system in the field to test the feasibility of the WSN and its applicability for structural health monitoring (SHM). Three field studies are undertaken in this research. The Frankford Church, an historic wooden church which required foundation replacement, is the first field study. Sensors monitor tilt of the church?s walls throughout construction. During the construction process, the entire floor of the church is removed and the tree stump foundations are replaced by concrete masonry unit (CMU) blocks and steel pedestals. The tilt in the walls is correlated to the construction process. St. Paul Lutheran, an historic masonry church with timber-framed roof, constitutes the second field study. In this structure, the foundations along the exterior walls are underpinned and the floors are removed and replaced with a <b>floating</b> concrete <b>slab.</b> Detected movements are also correlated to the construction efforts. The Johanniskirche, an historic masonry church with moisture problems, is the final field study case. Real-time and past measured WSN climate data is used to determine the most appropriate solution for the humid climate and resulting condensation problems in this structure. From these results, a moisture migration risk analysis protocol is created for use with a WSN to address condensation issues. The results of the tilt monitoring indicate that the approach is realistic to monitor tilt in the walls of historic structures. For future research, it is recommended to implement motes with higher tilt sensitivity. Also, further development of energy saving algorithms and energy harvesting methods will improve the WSN?s performance.

The three components of the load are considered; the quasi-static excitation (force generated by moving axle loads), the parametric excitation due to discrete supports of the rails and the excitation due to wheel and rail roughness and track unevenness.

Ground borne {{noise and vibration}} mitigation measures evaluation in normal operation conditions presented hereafter guarantees, especially in TO location along these extensions, allowable ground borne noise and vibration levels in nearby buildings & sensitive receptors. The measured <b>Floating</b> <b>slab</b> solutions measured within an extensive measurements campaign proven to achieving an overall ground borne and vibration attenuation of approx. 15 - 16 dB(A) in soil surface. A comprehensive comparative presentation of the results is an important tool in evaluating the expected environmental protection potential of similar mitigation measures regarding noise & vibration emissions & generated annoyance from urban railway networks operation...|$|E
40|$|This paper mainly {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} ground-borne vibrations due to the planned line 8 of Beijing metro which passes under the National Measurement Laboratory. A lot of vibration sensitive equipments are placed in the laboratory. It is therefore necessary to study the impact of vibrations induced by metro trains on sensitive equipments and important to propound a feasible vibration mitigation measure. Based on the coupled periodic finite element-boundary element (FE-BE) method, a 3 D dynamic track-tunnel-soil interaction model for metro line 8 {{has been used to}} predict vibrations in the free field induced by trains running at variable speeds between 30 km/h and 80 km/h. Four types of track structures commonly used on the Beijing metro network have been considered: (1) high resilience direct fixation fasteners, (2) Vanguard fasteners, (3) a <b>floating</b> <b>slab</b> track and (4) a floating ladder track. For each of these track types, the vibration isolation efficiency has been compared. The results of the numerical study can be used to predict vibrations in nearby buildings and to decide upon effective vibration countermeasures. status: publishe...|$|E
