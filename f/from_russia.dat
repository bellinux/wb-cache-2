5|$|Fleming's {{novels and}} early screen adaptations {{presented}} minimal {{equipment such as}} the booby-trapped attaché case in <b>From</b> <b>Russia</b> with Love, although this situation changed dramatically with the films. However, {{the effects of the}} two Eon-produced Bond films Dr. No and <b>From</b> <b>Russia</b> with Love had an effect on the novel The Man with the Golden Gun, through the increased number of devices used in Fleming's final story.|$|E
5|$|<b>From</b> <b>Russia,</b> with Love {{received}} broadly positive reviews at {{the time}} of publication. The book's sales were boosted by an advertising campaign that played upon a visit by the British Prime Minister Anthony Eden to Fleming's Goldeneye estate, and the publication of an article in Life, which listed <b>From</b> <b>Russia,</b> with Love as one of US President John F. Kennedy's ten favourite books. The story was serialised in the Daily Express newspaper, first in an abridged, multi-part form and then as a comic strip. In 1963 it was adapted into the second film in the Bond series, starring Sean Connery.|$|E

5|$|By the 1880s {{immigration}} <b>from</b> <b>Russia,</b> Eastern Europe, and Italy started rivaling {{immigration from}} Western Europe. Many {{of the immigrants}} <b>from</b> <b>Russia</b> and Eastern Europe were Jewish. In 1881 there were around 5,000 Jews in the city, and by 1905 the number had increased to 100,000. Philadelphia's Italian population grew from around 300 in 1870 to around 18,000 in 1900, with the majority settling in South Philadelphia. Along with foreign immigration, domestic migration by African Americans from the South led to Philadelphia having the largest black population of a Northern U.S. city in this period. By 1876, nearly 25,000 African Americans living in Philadelphia, and by 1890 the population was near 40,000. While immigrants moved into the city, Philadelphia's rich left for newer housing in the suburbs, with commuting made easy by newly constructed railroads. During the 1880s much of Philadelphia's upper class moved into the growing suburbs along the Pennsylvania Railroad's Main Line west of the city.|$|E

5|$|<b>From</b> <b>Russia,</b> with Love is {{the fifth}} novel by the English author Ian Fleming to feature his fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond. Fleming wrote the story in early 1956 at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica; {{at the time he}} thought it might be his final Bond book. The novel was first {{published}} in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape on 8 April 1957.|$|E
5|$|<b>From</b> <b>Russia,</b> with Love was {{released}} in the UK as a hardback on 8 April 1957, by the publishers Jonathan Cape. The American edition was published {{a few weeks later}} by Macmillan. In November 1956 the Prime Minister, Sir Anthony Eden, had visited Fleming's Jamaican Goldeneye estate, to recuperate from a breakdown in his health. This was much reported in the British press, and the publication of <b>From</b> <b>Russia,</b> with Love was accompanied by a promotional campaign that capitalised on Fleming's raised public profile. The serialisation of the story in The Daily Express in 1957 provided a boost to the sales of the book; a bigger rise in sales was to follow four years later. In an article in Life on 17 March 1961, the US President John F. Kennedy listed <b>From</b> <b>Russia,</b> with Love as one of his ten favourite books. This accolade, and its associated publicity, led to a surge in sales that made Fleming the biggest-selling crime writer in the US. There was a further boost to sales following the release of the film of the same name in 1963, which saw the sales of the Pan paperback rise from 145,000 in 1962 to 642,000 in 1963 and 600,000 in 1964.|$|E
