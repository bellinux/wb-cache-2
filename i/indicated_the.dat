In 1998, more than five million people a day watched the show's reruns on 120 stations.|$|E
5|$|A {{field study}} {{conducted}} in winter 1978 on Kangaroo Island found red wattlebirds to be territorial around {{a rich source}} of nectar, namely a large cup gum (Eucalyptus cosmophylla), driving off smaller honeyeaters.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged from}} the African coast late on July 10. The wave entered the Bahamas on July 21 and organized into Tropical Depression Six while 70miles (110km) east of Eleuthera. Initially the storm was predicted to execute a clockwise loop and drift to the west {{in response to a}} high pressure system. Several models <b>indicated</b> <b>the</b> possibility of the storm to drift westward into central Florida. Soon after the depression formed, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Franklin.|$|E
5|$|Another change {{inspired}} by the move was a return for the Football Echo man.

5|$|Due to the {{tropical}} cyclone's short life, overall track errors in model guidance were not significant, and most models accurately indicated Jerry's westward to west-northwest course into the Caribbean Sea. Most models and official forecasts {{did not anticipate}} Jerry's dissipation, and numerous models <b>indicated</b> <b>the</b> system would reach hurricane status within {{two to three days}} under favorable conditions. Prior to Jerry's formation, a tropical storm watch was issued for Barbados at 5 p.m. EDT on October 6 because of forecasts that <b>indicated</b> <b>the</b> depression could intensify to tropical storm intensity. As the depression intensified to tropical storm status and moved closer to the Windward Islands, a tropical storm watch was issued for Tobago by the government of the island nation and for nearby Grenada by the Trinidad and Tobago Meteorological Service at 5 a.m. EDT on October 7. A tropical storm warning was issued for Barbados at 8 a.m. EDT.|$|E
5|$|Early on August 3, {{strong wind}} shear over Chris {{detached}} the deep convection {{from the low}} level circulation, while a building ridge to its north turned the storm towards the west into an area of drier air. By mid-day on the 3rd the circulation was devoid of any convection within 85miles (135km), while the deeper convection spread across Puerto Rico and Hispaniola. Late on August 3, deep convection developed over the center of circulation again, though persistent vertical shear weakened Chris to a tropical depression on August 4. Due to computer models predicting lesser amounts of shear, forecasters <b>indicated</b> <b>the</b> possibility of moderate strengthening in the Gulf of Mexico to a 60mph (95km/h) storm. However, convection remained minimal, and Chris degenerated into a remnant {{area of low pressure}} late on August 4. Late on August 5, convection increased in the remnants of the storm, and forecasters <b>indicated</b> <b>the</b> potential for slow development over the Gulf of Mexico due to marginally favorable conditions. Redevelopment never occurred, and the remnant circulation dissipated near Havana, Cuba on August 6.|$|E
5|$|For the Japanese, {{the loss}} of the Admiralties meant {{the loss of}} their outpost line in the South Eastern Area.

Accordingly, the Eighteenth Army in New Guinea was ordered to prepare to defend Aitape and Wewak as well.|$|E

5|$|Hapticity {{is a term}} to {{describe}} the coordination {{of a group of}} contiguous atoms of a ligand bound to the central atom; it is indicated by the Greek character eta, η. Yttrium complexes were the first examples of complexes where carboranyl ligands were bound to a d0-metal center through a η7-hapticity. Vaporization of the graphite intercalation compounds graphite–Y or graphite– leads to the formation of endohedral fullerenes such as Y@C82. Electron spin resonance studies <b>indicated</b> <b>the</b> formation of Y3+ and (C82)3− ion pairs. The carbides Y3C, Y2C, and YC2 can be hydrolyzed to form hydrocarbons.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} post-translational modifications, NEDD9 {{is subject to}} {{significant}} phosphorylation based on growth conditions.

One study <b>indicated</b> <b>the</b> conversion of p115 into p105 is activated by cell detachment through cytoskeletal regulation of phosphatase PP2A, although other work has found conflicting results.|$|E
