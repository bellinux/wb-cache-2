5|$|His {{investigations}} angered many in Mexico's {{political elite}} {{and made him}} a frequent target of death threats. Buendía took the death threats he received very seriously and thereby carried a pistol, either on his belt or <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>leather</b> pocket. Prior to his death, Buendía wrote extensively on the alleged corruption within Mexico's Petroleum Workers Union; the allegations of wrongdoings of Jorge Díaz Serrano, former leader of Pemex, the national oil company; and Arturo Durazo Moreno, {{the former head of}} Mexico City's police force. Buendía also criticized the role of the U.S. government and the CIA in Mexico, and often published names of American officials involved in secret operations. Although he was quick to publish controversial reports, Buendía's direct reporting was respected and generally considered reliable given his access to top Mexican officials. He was the most-read journalist in Mexico's print media, and is often cited by newspapers and journalists as the most influential political columnist in Mexico of {{the second half of the}} 20th century.|$|E

25|$|These {{works were}} all {{published}} {{in an era}} before the cigarette had become the dominant form of tobacco consumption and pipes, cigars, and chewing tobacco were still commonplace. Many of the books were published in novel packaging that would attract the learned smoking gentleman. Pipe and Pouch came <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>leather</b> bag resembling a tobacco pouch and Cigarettes in Fact and Fancy (1901) came bound in leather, packaged in an imitation cardboard cigar box. By the late 1920s, the publication {{of this type of}} literature largely abated and was only sporadically revived in the later 20th century.|$|E

500|$|It was {{released}} by Avex Trax in Japan on February 9, 2000, marking her first single in the 2000s decade, and through Avex Entertainment Inc. worldwide in September 2008. It also served as Hamasaki's third and final limited edition single from Loveppears, limiting physical units to 300,000 copies. Subsequently, in mid 2000, a limited 12" [...] vinyl was issued through Avex Trax in Japan to promote her second part of her 2000 concert tour. A picture disc that featured a shot of Hamasaki <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>leather</b> pink jacket included HΛL's 2000 remix on side one, and an orchestral version of the recording on side two. The artwork was photographed by Japanese photographer Toru Kumazawa, and featured Hamasaki sitting in a beige–colored circular pod with fabric around her. The physical version of [...] "Fly High" [...] failed to include a booklet, {{which resulted in the}} cover sleeve being immolated as a picture disc, featuring an emphasised plastic sheet with information on the single.|$|E
500|$|Ferreira {{had already}} been {{performing}} [...] "You're Not the One" [...] before its formal release—at her concert {{on the last day}} of the 2013 Pitchfork Music Festival, she sang it as the ninth track of her setlist. After the song's digital release, she promoted it on television shows and radio lounges. On November 26, 2013 she sang the track during an appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman, where she wore [...] "opaque black sunglasses" [...] and a black blazer over a [...] "sheer top". Ferreira, who opened the American leg of Miley Cyrus' Bangerz Tour, included the song in her setlist for those concerts. On February 27, 2014—as she was on an interruption from the tour—Ferreira performed the song on Jimmy Kimmel Live. Dressed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>leather</b> jacket, shades and with her hair wet, she was praised by Ben Kaye from Consequence of Sound for her [...] "dazzling rendition" [...] of the song.

500|$|Whitney Phaneuf {{from the}} website HitFix {{described}} {{the scene where}} the singer is seen sweeping the table as [...] "one of her best diva moments". She also interpreted her character as a [...] "scorned" [...] woman and neglected wife. Similar sentiments were offered by Brenna Ehrlich of MTV News who felt that the man's role in the video was a neglectful and possibly cheating lover. Ehrlich went on to describe the mansion seen {{in the beginning of}} the video as Versailles-esque and felt that the singer unveiled her new alter ego, Yoncé, while seen at the party in a bar, flirting with other people. She concluded that despite the [...] "emotional turmoil" [...] featured throughout, the video ended on a hopeful note. John Walker, writing for the same publication, noted the singer managed to show real madness and jealousy, while [...] "smashing up her home out of insecurity". A more mixed review came from Brent DiCrescenzo of the magazine Time Out who wrote in his review, [...] "Walking down the street <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>leather</b> jacket. A car racing down roads at night. That's about it." ...|$|E
500|$|The book {{takes its}} name from Saint Cuthbert of Lindisfarne, North East England, in whose tomb it was placed, {{probably}} a few years after his death in 687. [...] Although it was long regarded as Cuthbert's personal copy of the Gospel, to which there are early references, and so a relic of the saint, the book is now thought to date from shortly after Cuthbert's death. [...] It was probably a gift from Monkwearmouth–Jarrow Abbey, where it was written, intended to be placed in St Cuthbert's coffin in the few decades after this was placed behind the altar at Lindisfarne in 698. [...] It presumably remained in the coffin through its long travels after 875, forced by Viking invasions, ending at Durham Cathedral. [...] The book was found inside the coffin and removed in 1104 when the burial was once again moved within the cathedral. [...] It was kept there with other relics, and important visitors were able to wear the book <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>leather</b> bag around their necks. [...] It is thought that after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in England by Henry VIII between 1536 and 1541, the book passed to collectors. [...] It was eventually given to Stonyhurst College, the Jesuit school in Lancashire.|$|E
500|$|In February 2010, Cyrus {{announced}} that her then-untitled third studio album {{would be released}} later that summer, which she felt was appropriate because it is [...] "good to blast in your car." [...] Later that April, it was {{announced that}} the record would be titled Can't Be Tamed, and would be released on June 22, 2010 in the United States. Consequently, it became the first project from Hollywood Records to be released under the [...] "day-and-date" [...] format, which allowed the project to be released nearly simultaneously worldwide instead of traditionally [...] "staggering" [...] its launch to accommodate [...] "the availability of the artist" [...] internationally. On May 7, Cyrus unveiled the album artwork through her website; it depicts Cyrus dressed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>leather</b> jacket, pants, and midriff-baring shirt while standing against a black-and-white background. It was noted for establishing an increasingly provocative public image for Cyrus; her stylist Simone Harouche stated that it was inspired by singer Joan Jett and the band Blondie, and was [...] "basically a strong statement saying in the most simple way, that she can’t be tamed–literally and metaphorically." [...] A deluxe version of the record was simultaneously released, which included the audio disc packaged with the standard version in addition to a bonus DVD that includes previously unseen footage from Cyrus' performance at The O2 Arena during the Wonder World Tour.|$|E

500|$|Poena cullei (from Latin 'penalty of the sack') under Roman law was a type {{of death}} penalty imposed on a subject who had been found guilty of parricide. The {{punishment}} consisted of being sewn up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>leather</b> sack, sometimes {{with an assortment of}} live animals, and then being thrown into water. The punishment may have varied widely in its frequency and precise form during the Roman period. For example, the earliest fully documented case is from ca. 100BCE, although scholars think the punishment may have developed about a century earlier (earlier than that, murderers, including parricides, would be handed over to the aggrieved family for punishment, rather than punishment being enacted by Roman state officials). Inclusion of live animals in the sack [...] is only documented from Early Imperial times, and at the beginning, only snakes are mentioned. At the time of Emperor Hadrian (2nd century CE), the most well known form of the punishment was documented, where a cock, a dog, a monkey and a viper were inserted in the sack. However, at the time of Hadrian poena cullei was made into an optional form of punishment for parricides (the alternate being thrown to the beasts in the arena). During the 3rd century CE up to the accession of Emperor Constantine, poena cullei fell out of use; Constantine revived it, now with only serpents to be added in the sack. Well over 200years later, Emperor Justinian reinstituted the punishment with the four animals, and poena cullei remained the statutory penalty for parricides within Byzantine law for the next 400years, when it was replaced with the punishment for parricides to be burnt alive instead.|$|E
