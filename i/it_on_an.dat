5|$|Like most of McLachlan's albums, Surfacing was {{recorded}} at Marchand's Wild Sky Studios in Morin-Heights, Quebec. Marchand, who produced, engineered and mixed the album, recorded <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> Otari RADAR recorder and a Neumann 149 microphone. McLachlan played piano, acoustic guitar and electric guitar and Marchand played keyboards, bass and a drum machine {{as well as}} providing background vocals. The other musicians on the album were Jim Creeggan on upright bass, Yves Desrosiers on guitar, musical saw, lap steel guitar and slide bass, Brian Minato on bass and electric guitar, Michel Pepin on electric guitar and Ashwin Sood (whom McLachlan married in 1997) on percussion and drums.|$|E

Russia has considered Hezbollah a legitimate sociopolitical organization. and the People's Republic of China remains neutral, and maintains contacts with Hezbollah.|$|E

5|$|By 25 September, {{the area}} {{occupied}} by the Lonsdale Force saw heavy fighting against self-propelled guns, flamethrower tanks, and infantry. There were no PIATs available to the force by now; instead Cain armed himself with a two-inch mortar. Mortars are muzzle-loading indirect fire weapons but Cain was forced to fire <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> almost horizontal plane due to the enemy's proximity. His citation states that his leadership ensured that the South Staffordshire gave no ground and drove the enemy off in complete disorder. By {{the end of the}} battle, Cain had been reportedly responsible for the destruction or disabling of six tanks, four of which were Tigers, {{as well as a number}} of self-propelled guns.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{the company}} reformulates various {{products}} {{in an attempt}} to boost sales of the product or to improve the taste, appearance, or physical consistency of the product. One such example of this is the BK Big Fish, the company's fish sandwich offering in North America. Burger King's original fish sandwich, introduced as early as the late 1960s in some markets, was called the Whaler; it was a smaller fish sandwich made with tartar sauce and lettuce served on the small sesame seed roll BK used for their hamburgers. When Burger King introduced its broiled chicken sandwich in 1990, the BK Broiler, it changed the fish sandwich's breading to a panko style, began serving <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> oatmeal-dusted roll that was used for the broiled chicken sandwich, and renamed the product the Ocean Catch sandwich. When BK reformulated the BK Broiler, the company also reformulated the Ocean Catch as the BK Big Fish in its current configuration. The sandwich was again briefly reformulated after the phase-out of the Baguette sandwiches, and was reintroduced as the Big Fish in 2005.|$|E

5|$|Team member Lucas Davis {{compiled}} {{the development}} tools and documentation for Anachronox and released them in August 2001. Four bug-fixing patches exist for Anachronox. Ion Storm {{created the first}} (1.01), which fixed the Windows 2000 buffer overrun crash and implemented other improvements such as taxi-cabs between distant points and enhanced save game functionality. Ion Storm released the first patch (1.01) on July 2, 2001. Joey Liaw set up a GeoCities website for reporting bugs and technical information after the game's release, and worked on a new patch in his spare time. The second patch (1.02, or build 44) was released in May 2003 and overhauls the save-game system and provides other important stability fixes. The third and fourth patches—1.02 (build 45), released September 2003, and 1.02 (build 46), released April 2004—are fan-made unofficial patches and fix {{most of the remaining}} bugs. Fans have translated the game into German and released a conversion patch. Level designer Rich Carlson released a scrapped secret level for Anachronox in February 2004 after finding <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> old floppy disk.|$|E
5|$|The plot {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} Indiana Jones {{universe}} and revolves around the eponymous protagonist's global search for the legendary sunken city of Atlantis. Sophia Hapgood, an old co-worker of Indiana Jones who gave up her archaeological career to become a psychic, supports him along the journey. The two partners are pursued by the Nazis who seek to use the power of Atlantis for warfare, and serve as the adventure's antagonists. The story was written by Hal Barwood and Noah Falstein, the game's designers, who had rejected the original plan to base <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> unused movie script. They came up with the final concept while researching real-world sources for a suitable plot device.|$|E

25|$|Ruter is {{planning}} on upgrading the Holmenkollen Line. They want {{to remove all}} level crossings and stations along the line. This will require that the line is lowered past Vinderen so the road can pass over <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> overpass. Ruter wants to keep the station {{in the immediate vicinity}} to is current location. A 2012 report estimated this to cost 206 million Norwegian kroner.|$|E

Gilgamesh, by binding stones to his feet so he can walk on the bottom, manages to obtain the plant. Gilgamesh proposes to {{investigate}} if the plant has the hypothesized rejuvenation ability by testing <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> old man once he returns to Uruk.|$|E
25|$|However, Vancouver {{failed to}} {{discover}} {{two of the}} largest and most important rivers on the Pacific coast, the Fraser River and the Columbia River. He also missed the Skeena River near Prince Rupert in northern British Columbia. Vancouver did eventually learn of the river before he finished his survey—from Robert Gray, captain of the American merchant ship that conducted the first Euroamerican sailing of the Columbia River on 11 May 1792, after first sighting <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> earlier voyage in 1788. However it and the Fraser River never made it onto Vancouver's charts.|$|E

25|$|Another {{source of}} {{contention}} {{is that the}} Brown crime scene fingerprint has the appearance of having been rolled, which is the practice of taking a person's inked finger and rolling <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> index card, and not the smudged, bloody and unreadable print as originally reported. Traditionally, after the fingertip is covered in ink from either the suspect's hand being pressed {{on top of an}} ink pad or an ink roller being run across it, the finger is placed on the card on one edge. It is rolled once from one edge to the finger's other edge to produce a large, clear print.|$|E
25|$|During {{her time}} working at Castelli Gallery, Lawler was making paintings, artist’s books, prints, and {{photographs}} of her own. But when she landed her first official gallery exhibition, in 1978 at Artists Space, she did not exhibit any of that work. Instead, she borrowed a small 1883 portrait of a horse from Aqueduct Racetrack — it had been hanging over a Xerox machine in the offices — and mounted <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> empty wall at the gallery. To highlight her appropriation, she installed two spotlights: one above the picture and another pointed out the window, at the building next door, hinting to sidewalk passersby {{that there was something}} of note going on upstairs.|$|E
25|$|Another {{characteristic}} {{dimension is}} the airfoil chord. In these tests the jet width {{was sufficient to}} keep the vortex shedding coherent across <b>it.</b> <b>On</b> <b>an</b> airfoil {{there would be a}} correlation length less than the wingspan resulting in a number independent dipoles arrayed laterally. The sound power would be diminished somewhat. Since the dipole model is based on the time rate of change of the force, reduction of sound power might be accomplished by reducing that rate. One possible means would be for the opposite sides of the surface to gradually sense each other spatially prior to the trailing edge and thus reduce the rate at the edge. This might be done by a section of graduated porous or flexible materials.|$|E

25|$|On the American side, {{the defense}} {{depended}} on field fortifications, innovative use of light anti-tank weapons like the bazooka and anti-tank mines, {{and most importantly}} {{the support of a}} formidable array of indirect fire. American tanks and anti-tank guns were considered ineffective against the newer German fighting vehicles. This was compensated to some extent by use of the 76 mm (76.2 mm) M1A1 gun, designated as the 3-inch cannon, mounted on the Sherman tank and the M18 Hellcat tank destroyer. The British had also designed high velocity anti-armor ammunition for the 57mm anti-tank cannon, which gave this gun {{a new lease on life}} against the new heavier German units. American gunners were quick to trade for whatever their allies wanted for this highly effective ammunition. The Americans also adapted the 90mm anti-aircraft gun as an anti-tank cannon, the 90mm cannon, and mounted <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> open turret on the Sherman tank as the M36 Jackson tank-destroyer. This was another innovation effective against German heavy tanks.|$|E
25|$|Under her {{editorial}} management {{it proved}} the swiftest journalistic success on record, numbering its subscribers by the hundred thousand, and while other papers took {{a loss for}} granted in the beginning, putting itself upon a paying basis at the outset. While she had assistants in every department, among their names those of some most distinguished in our literature, she was herself the inspiration of the whole corps, and under the advice and suggestion of its proprietors she held <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> even course. There was scarcely a poet, or a story-writer, or novelist of any rank in America or England {{who is not a}} contributor to its pages, and its purity, its self-respect, its high standard, and its literary excellence, were unrivalled among periodical publications. The influence of such a paper within American homes was something hardly to be computed. It was always on the side of good and sweet things; it made the right seem the best and pleasantest; it taught while it has amused; it held the happiness, well-being, and virtue of women and the family as its first consideration, and it created a wholesome atmosphere wherever it was constantly read. Through its columns, its editor made her hand felt in countless families for nearly 16 years, and helped to shape the domestic ends of a generation to peace and righteousness.|$|E
25|$|During {{his college}} summers and vacations, Riley {{had worked in}} the mines of the nearby Silver Valley at Wallace, and landed a job there with a mining company {{following}} graduation at age 26 in 1952. The school superintendent was short-handed for instructors and asked him to fill in as a teacher, and he agreed to try <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> interim basis, with the mining company's permission. After growing up in a tough environment, Riley admired the hard-nosed grit of the mining community and found he liked teaching and coaching, and never returned to mining. He started as an assistant coach in football and basketball and the head coach in baseball. He was the head football coach at WHS for four seasons, starting in 1955, leading the Miners to a 23-14-1 record. He was also the head coach in basketball for two seasons, starting in the fall of 1957. Riley met his wife, Mary Shumaker from nearby Mullan, while working in Wallace; they were married in November 1951 and their first two sons were born there. They left Wallace in 1959 for Lewiston, where he was the head football coach at Lewiston High School for three years. His overall record with the LHS Bengals was 15-14-1, with a final season of 1-8 due to disciplinary actions.|$|E
