Subsequently, hourly simulations of a building in Omaha, Nebraska, USA, was implemented and validated that the VAV system with the optimal reset method could consume the least fan energy without sacrificing thermal comfort.

40|$|Building Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system {{maintain}} comfortable {{indoor environment}} by supplying processed air to each terminal precisely through duct system. Testing, Adjusting and Balancing (TAB) plays {{critical role in}} achieving desired air distribution. Traditional TAB method is inaccurate and inefficient due to its trail-and-error natural, which forces people to pay high but expect low. Recently, it has been proposed that non-iterative approach to TAB is promising to improve performance and reduce cost. In this paper, a novel non-iterative balancing method is developed and implemented for TAB engineers to adjust dampers systematically and efficiently. Different from other TAB methods, this method is based on modeling and optimization. The mathematical model for duct system is firstly developed from its components including fan, duct segments and dampers to predict flow rates and pressures in the duct system for any <b>damper</b> <b>positions.</b> To identify the parameters in the model, flow rate measurements are taken for each terminal on real system under different <b>damper</b> <b>positions.</b> With the obtained model, optimal <b>damper</b> <b>positions</b> that gives desired air distribution are calculated by minimizing a specific objective function. To facilitate the adjusting process in real duct system, a sequential tuning instructions are generated which can help engineers to adjust dampers to their proper position using flowmeter as indicators. In this sequential tuning process, each damper only adjusts once to reach balance. Because the pressure and airflow dynamics of the duct system has been modeled, the entire TAB procedure is deterministic and non-iterative. Simulations are performed to validate {{the effectiveness of this}} method in Matlab/Simulink environment. Comparison study with existing methods shows that the proposed TAB method significantly shorten the duration of process and reduces balancing error while using easily-accessible equipment like pressure sensor and flowmeter only. It can be expected that the TAB service contractor will apply this method for advanced duct system where accurate air distribution is strictly required...|$|R

40|$|In the U. S. A Variable Air Volume (VAV) {{system is}} one of most {{commonly}} used air system for multiple-zone commercial buildings due to its capability to meet the varying heating and cooling loads of different building thermal zones. One of key component of VAV system is the terminal VAV box. There are an air damper and a reheat coil in the box. How to effectively and efficiently control the VAV box {{plays a significant role}} to reduce energy consumption and maintain acceptable indoor environment in buildings. Currently, there are two control logics used for controlling VAV box, namely, single maximum and dual maximum control logics. The single maximum logic is the most common, where the room temperature setpoint is maintained by only adjusting the reheat coil valve position in the heating model. The <b>damper</b> <b>position</b> is kept as the minimal to satisfy the ventilation requirement only. On the other hand, the more advanced dual maximum control logic realizes the room air temperature control by adjusting both <b>damper</b> <b>position</b> and reheat coil valve position in the heating model. For the cooling model, both control logics have the same action to maintain room air temperature setpoint through adjusting the <b>damper</b> <b>position.</b> Â In this study, a model-based optimal control is explored to minimize the energy consumption of the VAV box with a hot water reheat coil. Data driven approach based on an Autoregressive exogenous (ARX) model is investigated to represent dynamics of the room thermal response. The similar data-driven approach is used to develop an energy consumption model of the VAV box. Measured data for the VAV box from a real building is used to train and test data-driven model. Such data includes room air temperature, outdoor air temperature, supply air temperature, supply air flow rate, <b>damper</b> <b>position,</b> reheat coil valve position and VAV box energy consumption. A platform of AMPL (A Modeling Language for Mathematical Programming) is used to for mathematical modeling and links to different optimization solvers. Â In addition, uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis are conducted to help understand the model behaviors and performance.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{methods used}} for, and results from, tests {{conducted during the}} final installation and commissioning of a modular Steiner tunnel delivered to the UWFRL. The overall aim of the present research is to design the support systems for this new Steiner tunnel, to commission the tunnel for operation and to characterize the final tunnel operation against a series of materials with known fire performance characteristics. The first stage of commissioning is to design and implement the safety controls system for the Steiner tunnel, fulfilling all {{the requirements of the}} safety regulations and provide additional safety calculations needed for approval of the system. Following this, the overall tunnel operation is tested with the tunnel installed at its full 25 foot length. In the first phase of testing, a series of `pre- calibration' experiments is conducted using various off-the-shelf wood product samples. These tests are designed to examine the behaviour of the tunnel prior to the much more costly, formal red oak calibration test, since {{it has been reported that}} red oak calibration criteria can be fairly difficult to meet, especially for newly constructed tunnels. Tests are conducted on various wood products including red oak, OSB, particle board, and plywood to evaluate the tunnel performance. The three specific parameters that are found to have significant influence on tunnel operation are gas flow to the burner, draft pressure within the main tunnel section, and the exhaust <b>damper</b> <b>position.</b> During calibration tests, it is found that of the three parameters that are studied (gas flow, tunnel draft, and <b>damper</b> <b>position),</b> the <b>damper</b> <b>position</b> has the most influence on FSI. The far damper should be utilized to control tunnel air flow. If this is not possible, the <b>damper</b> <b>position</b> should be kept 18 pipe diameters from the end of the tunnel. Gas flow effects are found to be largely dependent on outside temperatures, and most likely is outside of lab facilities control. For gas flow, flame spread results are most affected for flow rates below 7. 0 m^ 3 /hr which corresponded to maintaining inlet gas temperature above 18 C. Therefore, it is determined that the tunnel should only be operated when the lab temperature is above 18 C. Airflow through the tunnel as indicated by tunnel draft pressure is found to greatly impact measured flame spread characteristics for most samples tested. The appropriate range for the tunnel draft pressure is determined to be between 0. 090 - 0. 110 in-WC (22. 4 - 27. 4 Pa) so that it would not have a significant effect on flame spread results. Since sudden changes in draft pressure are found to essentially obstruct flame progression, FSI results are improved when fan control measures are implemented to stabilize the draft pressure within the main tunnel enclosure...|$|E

The results were analysed using two frequency response functions (FRFs) from which the model parameters were derived, being 1) the mechanical admittance and 2) the reflexive impedance. These FRFs were analysed by a neuromusculoskeletal model that implicitly separates the reflexive feedback properties (position, velocity and acceleration feedback gains) from intrinsic muscle visco-elasticity. The results show substantial changes in estimated reflex gains under conditions of variable bandwidth of the applied force disturbance or variable degrees of external <b>damping.</b> <b>Position</b> and velocity feedback gains were relatively larger when the force disturbance contained only low frequencies.

40|$|A {{substantial}} {{fraction of}} HVAC energy use in large commercial buildings {{is due to}} fan operation. Fan energy use depends {{in part on the}} relationship between system pressure drop and flow through the fan, which is commonly called a "system curve". As a step toward enabling better selections of air-handling system components and analyses of common energy efficiency measures such as duct static pressure reset and duct leakage sealing, this paper shows that a simple four-parameter physical model can be used to define system curves. Our model depends on the square of the fan flow, as is commonly considered. It also includes terms that account for linear-like flow resistances such as filters and coils, and for supply duct leakage when <b>damper</b> <b>positions</b> are fixed or are changed independently of static pressure or fan flow. Only two parameters are needed for systems with variable-position supply dampers (e. g., VAV box dampers modulating to control flow). For these systems, reducing or eliminating supply duct leakage does not change the system curve. The parametric system curve may be most useful when applied to field data. Non-linear techniques could be used to fit the curve to fan pressure rise and flow measurements over a range of operating conditions.

40|$|Building {{technology}} has been developed due to the improvement of information technology. Specifically, a human can control and monitor the building operation {{by a number of}} sensors and actuators. The sensors and actuators are installed on every single element in a building. Thus, the large stream of building data allows us to implement both quantitative and qualitative improvements. However, there are still limitations to mapping between the physical building element and cyber system. To solve this mapping issue, last summer, a text mining methodology was developed as part of a project conducted by the Consortium for Building Energy Innovation. Building data was extracted from building 661, in Philadelphia, PA. The ground truth of the building data point with semantic information was labeled by manual inspection. And a Support Vector Machine was implemented to investigate the relationship between the data point name and the semantic information. This algorithm achieves 93 % accuracy with unseen building 661 data points. Techniques and lessons were gained from this project, and this knowledge was used to develop the framework for analyzing the building data from the Gates Hillman Center (GHC) building, Pittsburgh PA. This new framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, we initially tried to cluster the data points by similar semantic information, using the hierarchical clustering method. However, the effectiveness and accuracy of the clustering method is not adequate for this framework. Thus, the filtering and classification model is developed to identify the semantic information of the data points. From the filtering and classification method, it correctly identifies the <b>damper</b> <b>position</b> and supply air duct pressure data point with 90 % accuracy by daily statistical features. Having the semantic information from the first stage, the second stage figures out the relationship between Variable Air Volume (VAV) terminal units and Air Handling Units (AHU). The intuitive thermal and flow relationship between VAVs and AHUs are investigated at the beginning, and the statistical features clustering method is applied from the VAV discharge temperature data. However, the control strategy of this building makes this relationship invisible. Alternatively we then compared the similarity between <b>damper</b> <b>position</b> at VAVs and supply air duct pressure at AHUs by calculating the cross correlation. Finally, this similarity scoring method achieved 80 % accuracy to map the relationship between VAVs and AHUs. The suggested framework will guide the user to find the desired information such as the VAVs – AHUs relationship from the problem generated by a large number of heterogeneous sensor networks by using data-driven methodology...|$|E

The mathematical model establishes a link between the velocity of air in front of the <b>damper,</b> <b>position</b> of the damper blade and the moment acting on the blade caused by the air flow. This research aims to experimentally verify the mathematical model for the damper type with non-cascading blades. Four different types of dampers with non-cascading blades were considered: single blade dampers, dampers with two cross-blades, dampers with two parallel blades and dampers with two blades of which one is a fixed blade in the horizontal position. The case of a damper with a straight pipeline positioned in front of and behind the damper was taken in consideration. Calibration and verification of the mathematical model was conducted experimentally. The experiment was conducted on the laboratory facility for testing dampers used for regulation of the air flow rate in heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems. The design and setup of the laboratory facility, as well as construction, adjustment and calibration of the laboratory damper are presented in this paper. The mathematical model was calibrated by using one set of data, while the verification of the mathematical model was conducted by using the second set of data. The mathematical model was successfully validated and it can be used for accurate measurement of the air velocity on dampers with non-cascading blades under different operating conditions.

However, such methods are not robust because the supply air static pressure set-point will gradually increase to its high limit in case some VAV terminals are abnormal. Such abnormal happens quite often as a survey reported that 20. 1 % of the VAV terminals were ineffective in the field. This study provides a practically applicable fault tolerant control strategy for VAV systems. Instead of using VAV <b>damper</b> <b>positions</b> which contain limited information of space thermal comfort, the developed strategy utilizes other available information for the optimal control. A statistical method is also used in this strategy. After a throughout in-situ test, the strategy has been permanently implemented in all office floors (142, 000 m 2) in a high-rise building since July of year 2014. Although there are some statistical based optimal control methods have been reported, the permanently application of such methods at large scale is rarely seen in literature. This paper presents {{the details of the}} fault tolerant control strategy as well as its in-situ test results. Supported by the test data, the new control strategy is compared with the conventional strategy which was originally implemented in the building. The supply air static pressure is reduced significantly resulting in 33. 6 % power saving while the space thermal comfort was still maintained. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new way}} of using projective methods for simulating the constrained dynamics of deformable surfaces. We show that the often used implicit integration method for discretized elastic systems is equivalent to the projection of regularized constraints. We use this knowledge to derive a Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient implicit solver and a new projection scheme based on energy preserving integration. We also show a novel way of adding <b>damping</b> to <b>position</b> based dynamics and a different view on iterative solvers. In the end we apply these fresh insights to cloth simulation and develop a constraint based finite element method capable of accurately modeling thin elastic materials...|$|R
40|$|Strong {{evidence}} for pairing and superfluidity {{has recently been}} found in atomic Fermi gases at the BCS-BEC crossover both in collective modes and RF excitation energies. It is argued that the scale for the effective pairing gaps measured in RF experiments is set by the lowest quasiparticle in-gap excitation energies. These are calculated at the BCS-BEC crossover from semiclassical solutions to the Bogoliubov-deGennes equations. The strong damping of the radial breathing mode observed in the BCS limit occur when the lowest quasiparticle excitation energies coincide with the radial frequency, which indicates that a coupling between them take place.
