25|$|Trading {{companies}} (desiring furs and hides) {{determined that}} sending out men {{to trade with}} the Native American <b>groups</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> desired hides was more efficient than building trading posts and inviting the Native American people to visit. The traders would obtain their goods from stores in Taos or Santa Fe then return to sell the hides obtained in trade with the Native American thus making the Taos Mountain Trail conduit more important. To aid the trade, Bent's Fort was built in 1833 and El Pueblo Trading Post followed in 1842. Traders headquartered in Bent's Fort and El Pueblo went out to trade with goods from Taos. The Taos Mountain Trail continued in use as it provided quick access to a settled community.|$|E

25|$|The Arab revolt is seen {{by historians}} as the first {{organized}} movement of Arab nationalism. It brought together different Arab <b>groups</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time with the common goal to fight for independence from the Ottoman Empire. Much {{of the history of}} Arabic independence stemmed from the revolt beginning with the kingdom founded by Hussein. After the war was over, the Arab revolt had implications. Groups of people were put into classes based on if they had fought in the revolt or not and what their rank was. In Iraq, a group of Sharifian Officers from the Arab Revolt formed a political party which they were head of. Still to this day the Hashemite kingdom in Jordan is influenced by the actions of Arab leaders in the revolt.|$|E
