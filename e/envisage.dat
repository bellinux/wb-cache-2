5|$|The main {{entrance}} to the castle would have involved crossing a stone bridge between the two easterly ditch bridge towers and the main gatehouse; little remains of the bridge towers today and a timber entrance way to the gatehouse replaces the bridge. A water gate overlooks a protected stairway of 127 steps that runs down {{to the foot of}} the cliffs. In the 13th century, the sea came up close to the stairway, allowing resupply by sea, but today the sea has retreated significantly, making it more difficult to <b>envisage</b> the concept in its original setting.|$|E
5|$|Holmboe {{published}} his first textbook in mathematics in 1825. The 274-page book was named Lærebog i Mathematiken. Første Deel (Textbook in Mathematics. Part One). In 1827 he followed {{with the second}} volume, Lærebog i Mathematiken. Anden Deel (Textbook in Mathematics. Part Two), consisting of a further 155 pages. He used his own teaching experience as the background for his writing; mainly abstract, {{the purpose of the}} books was to instill logical thinking. For instance, in the field geometry, it enticed readers to <b>envisage</b> a figure instead of putting it to paper. The books became widely used, and were reprinted in four and five volumes respectively.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the Soviet Union {{originated}} Project 1144 Orlan, {{a project}} intended {{to design and}} build a large, nuclear powered anti-submarine vessel. At the time, the Soviets did not <b>envisage</b> that arming surface ships with anti-ship missiles was required, as then current doctrine had it that submarines were the main platform for attacking enemy shipping. However, {{the sinking of the}} Israeli destroyer INS Eilat in 1967 by anti-ship missiles fired from an Egyptian missile boat led to a re-think of the use of surface ships in the role. The threat of US Navy surface ships, which were increasingly capable of a range of different missions, led {{to the idea of a}} single ship combining anti-aircraft, anti-ship and anti-submarine capabilities crystalising.|$|E

25|$|Issues {{surrounding}} {{energy has}} risen in significance. Both countries have growing energy demand to support economic growth.

25|$|Free {{movement}} of people across the EU will give many Turkish people the opportunity to easily migrate {{to other parts of}} Europe in search of work, or a higher standard of living. The option of migration out of Turkey will inevitably ease tensions in the east of the country, as the prospect of a better standard of living will tend to cool separatist tendencies. Some secularists in Turkey <b>envisage</b> that the accession of Turkey will contribute to the spread of secular western values in Turkey. Conversely, some non-secularists in Turkey <b>envisage</b> that accession will contribute to the further growth and acceptance of Islam in Europe. The EU accession bid has stimulated Turkey's political and legal reforms and intensified the democratisation process.|$|E

Long-term proposals <b>envisage</b> a line running west {{from the airport to}} Ratho and Newbridge and another connecting Granton Square to Newhaven via Lower Granton Road, thus completing the Line 1 (North Edinburgh) loop. A further line serving the south of the city has also been suggested.|$|E
25|$|While {{attending}} Oriel College, Rhodes {{became a}} Freemason in the Apollo University Lodge. Although initially {{he did not}} approve of the organisation, he {{continued to be a}} Freemason until his death in 1902. The shortcomings of the Freemasons, in his opinion, later caused him to <b>envisage</b> his own secret society with the goal of bringing the entire world under British rule. According to Carroll Quigley, he set up the Round Table movement to this end.|$|E

25|$|Although many Ring {{productions}} try {{to remain}} close to Wagner's original stage design and direction, others seek to re-interpret the Ring for modern audiences, often including decor and action that Wagner himself did not <b>envisage.</b> The production by Peter Hall, conducted by Georg Solti at Bayreuth in 1983 {{is an example}} of the former, while the production by Richard Jones at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden in 1994–1996, conducted by Bernard Haitink, {{is an example of}} the latter.|$|E
25|$|Several {{initiatives}} <b>envisage</b> {{to reduce}} indoor air contamination by limiting VOC emissions from products. There are regulations in France and in Germany, and numerous voluntary ecolabels and rating systems containing low VOC emissions criteria such as EMICODE, M1, Blue Angel and Indoor Air Comfort in Europe, {{as well as}} California Standard CDPH Section 01350 and several others in the USA. These initiatives changed the marketplace where {{an increasing number of}} low-emitting products has become available during the last decades.|$|E

They also warn that higher oil prices might lead to the exploitation of high-carbon alternatives such as oil sands, oil shales, heavy oils, and synthetic fuels from coal and gas, leading to increasing emissions, unless {{carbon capture and storage}} technologies are employed.|$|E

25|$|According to Chertok, {{after the}} U.S. {{developed}} its Space Shuttle programme, the Soviet military became suspicious {{that it could}} be used for military purposes, due to its enormous payload, several times that of previous U.S. launch vehicles. The Soviet government asked the TsNIIMash (ЦНИИМАШ, Central Institute of Machine-building, a major player in defense analysis) for an expert opinion. Institute director, Yuri Mozzhorin, recalls {{that for a long time}} the institute could not <b>envisage</b> a civilian payload large enough to require a vehicle of that capacity.|$|E
25|$|Until 1969, therefore, the Confiteor was spoken (not sung) {{twice at}} the {{beginning}} of Mass, after the recitation of Psalm 42/43, once by the priest and once by the server(s) or by the deacon and subdeacon. It was also said, once only (not by the priest), before Communion was distributed to the faithful, until Pope John XXIII in his 1960 Code of Rubrics had it omitted when Communion was distributed within Mass. As the Tridentine Missal did not <b>envisage</b> any distribution of Communion to the faithful within Mass, it was the rite of giving Communion to the faithful outside of Mass that was used even within Mass.|$|E
25|$|GGYC {{also argued}} that the rules that should apply to the race must be the SNG rules that were in force when GGYC filed its challenge. Otherwise, said GGYC, SNG could {{arbitrarily}} change the rules {{so as to make}} it impossible for the challenger to win. For example, said GGYC, the modified rules could specify that the challenger would have to race while dragging an anchor. According to GGYC, it did not make sense to <b>envisage</b> that the rules could be changed after the challenge was issued, since the challenger based its challenge on SNG's rules {{at the time of the}} challenge. GGYC also challenged certain provisions of the agreement between ISAF and SNG, in particular concerning the powers of the jury.|$|E
