A total of 107 sample sites, abandoned since 0 to 45 years ago and distributed in eight valleys of central Corsica, were studied. Results show a high (r 2 = 0. 86 P < 0. 0001) correlation between the abandonment date derived from historic aerial photographs and the age of the oldest woody specimen in the site. For recent abandonment periods, the oldest woody species present in sample plots were grazing tolerant shrubs (short-lived species). When the abandonment period exceeded 20 years, the oldest species in sample plots were long-lived tree species. The use of category (short or long-lived species) and age of oldest woody species of sites allow to create a quantitative estimation of abandonment period available without old aerial photographs. This new chronological variable is relevant for studying intermediate (one to several decades) periods of abandonment in secondary succession processes.

40|$|Replacing {{incandescent}} light bulbs with compact fluorescents (CFLs) {{has traditionally been}} seen as a cost effective means of promoting energy conservation. Recently, however, the magnitude of energy savings associated with CFLs has been called into question. Specifically, recent findings suggest an "interactive effect" associated with the replacement of {{incandescent light}} bulbs with CFLs in the residential sector. In this scenario, the reduced wattage of CFLs, relative to incandescent bulbs, generates less heat, which in turn, requires additional natural gas usage during the heating season. Engineering studies suggest the magnitude of the effect is significant in energy terms, which implies that the energy savings associated with CFLs may be significantly overstated. In this paper, we use billing analysis to test for the presence of interactive effects. Our analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset that includes monthly household electricity and natural gas usage, the number of CFL bulbs installed, the <b>installation</b> <b>date,</b> and a set of household characteristics. Our results suggest that CFLs do indeed save electricity. However, we do not find any support for the hypothesis that CFLs cause increased usage of natural gas.

40|$|The {{performance}} of residential geothermal heat pumps (GHPs) {{was assessed by}} comparing heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system and whole house energy use of GHP houses and control houses. Actual energy savings were calculated and compared to expected savings (based on ARI ratings and literature) and predicted savings (based on coefficient of performance - COP - measurements). Differences between GHP and control houses were normalized for heating degree days and floor area or total insulation value. Predicted savings were consistently slightly below expected savings but {{within the range of}} performance cited by the industry. Average rated COP was 3. 4. Average measured COP was 3. 1. Actual savings were inconsistent and sometimes significantly below predicted savings. No correlation was found between actual savings and actual energy use. This suggests that factors such as insulation and occupant behavior probably have greater impact on energy use than type of HVAC equipment. There was also no clear correlation between climate and actual savings or between climate and actual energy use. There was a trend between GHP <b>installation</b> <b>date</b> and savings. Newer units appear to have lower savings than some of the older units which is opposite of what one would expect given the increase in rated efficiencies of GHPs. There are a number of explanations for why actual savings are repeatedly below rated savings or predicted savings. Poor ground loop sizing or installation procedures could be an issue. Given that performance is good compared to ASHPs but poor compared to electric resistance homes, the shortfall in savings could be due to duct leakage. The takeback effect could also be a reason for lower than expected savings. Occupants of heat pump homes are likely to heat more rooms and to use more air-conditioning than occupants of electric resistance homes. 10 refs., 17 figs., 10 tabs...|$|E
40|$|In 2002, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering {{partnered with}} the Environment and Public Health Organization {{to develop and}} {{disseminate}} the KanchanTM Arsenic Filter (KAF) for the low-cost removal of arsenic from drinking water in rural Nepal. In this system, arsenic is removed via absorption {{onto the surface of}} ferric hydroxide, or rust, through the integration of locally available iron nails into a BioSand Filter setup. Since 2002, the KAF filter has been successfully disseminated in approximately 24, 000 Nepali households. However, recent studies have indicated that under certain raw water conditions, the KAF may inadequately reduce groundwater arsenic concentrations to levels below the Nepali government guideline of 50 ptg/L. The present study focused on identifying and determining the impact of raw water parameters on the arsenic removal efficiency of the KAF. These parameters included arsenic, ferrous iron, dissolved oxygen, silica, phosphorous, pH, hardness, chloride, manganese, and electrical conductivity concentrations. In addition, filter flow rate, <b>installation</b> <b>date,</b> location, and user survey results were recorded. A total of 100 filters, of ages from less than one year to seven years, from 79 groundwater sources and 15 villages - primarily in the Nawalparasi District - were tested. Data showed that poorly performing KAFs resulted from groundwater conditions that did not promote the corrosion of the iron nails. These conditions included low groundwater ferrous iron levels (< 3 mg/L), low ferrous iron levels after water had passed though the nails (< 1. 1 mg/L), low chloride concentrations (< 7 mg/L), and low hardness concentrations (< 350 mg/L of CaCO 3). In order for the filter to be promoted in areas with various groundwater conditions, it is recommended that future studies explore the incorporation of local components into the KAF system to increase iron corrosion. by Claudia M.

40|$|The {{security}} alarms {{services market}} in the United States delivers hardware equipment and services to homeowners and businesses to help monitor and enhance personal property protection. Customer satisfaction via wait time reduction, first call resolution, and cost minimization are key drivers of success to players in this market. Most companies invest heavily in customer service systems including call centers. Our client, AlarmCo, a top provider of property protection, manages an inbound call center that supports a range of questions from customers who call within thirty days from the alarm <b>installation</b> <b>date.</b> Often, security companies fail to utilize strategic solutions when managing inbound customer call traffic and default to reactive measures which unnecessarily increase customer wait times. The key question the team aims to address in this thesis is: "How can we improve the customer service experience for customers of a major security service provider in the United States?" For this thesis, MIT partnered with OnProcess Technology, a managed services provider specializing in complex, global service supply chain operations, to develop a robust framework to preemptively {{reduce the number of}} inbound customer calls, and thereby improve customer service. Using ABC segmentation, the team categorized customers by reason code and demographics. To simulate the client's call center queue, the team calculated the key inputs for the queuing model including average wait time, interarrival rates and number of servers. The team then chose and developed the M/M/n stochastic queuing model for the simulation. The M/M/n queue reflects a simple system with parallel servers, arrivals with a Poisson distribution and service times that are exponentially distributed. Next, the customer segmentation was used to develop targeted preemptive solutions. Taking into account feasibility ratings, the team assigned success rates to each solution and adjusted the inbound call data accordingly. By analyzing the outputs of the simulation before and after adjusting the dataset, the team quantified the impact of preemptive solutions on the call center queue. Ultimately, narrowing to twelve strategic preemptive solutions led to the enhancement of the as-is queuing model by reducing average wait time by up to 35 %. by Qiao Chu and Nisha Palvia. Thesis: M.
