5|$|In 1995 and 1997, then Gov. John Rowland {{proposed}} to replace Shore Line East and the Waterbury Branch with bus service, citing a high subsidy of $18.70 per rider per trip, {{in order to}} decrease the unpopular <b>gas</b> <b>tax.</b> Lawmakers from the region called the proposals political and defended the line's ability to reduce congestion and pollution, while opponents of the line called it an example of government waste. The Shore Line East Rider's Association and other groups lobbied to save both services each time, and after public hearings a small fare increase was enacted in late 1997 instead.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of his administration, Leggett took the lead on a number of {{controversial}} issues. To help alleviate transportation funding difficulties and move County transit projects forward, he proposed a statewide <b>gas</b> <b>tax</b> increase, a position he first articulated in his race for County Executive. This proposal, which happened {{in the midst of a}} state budget crunch and in response to high levels of traffic congestion in the county, was supported by the County Council but largely ignored by incoming Governor Martin O'Malley. Leggett continued to advocate for the increase throughout his term.|$|E
5|$|Undaunted by {{the failure}} of the bond issue, Fields {{returned}} to the 1926 General Assembly with more proposals, including another increase in the gasoline tax to provide the funds needed to construct the state highway system. The 1926 Assembly passed more legislation than any previous legislature, including the increased <b>gas</b> <b>tax</b> and several bills to reorganize state government. The state purchasing commission and the Department of Bus Transportation were among the entities created in the reorganization. Under Fields, the state implemented the first phase of desegregation busing.|$|E

5|$|One of the hardest-hit counties, Curry County, {{introduced}} a ballot measure {{to add a}} 3% sales tax to pay for county services. Oregon {{is one of only}} five states in the United States with no county or state sales tax, and the tax has been voted down regularly by voters whenever it has been proposed (though some areas assess a <b>gas</b> <b>tax,</b> and two cities in tourist areas, Ashland and Yachats, assess a local tax on prepared food). In Josephine County, after a proposed property tax increase to pay for law enforcement was defeated in May 2012, the sheriff's office reduced its staff by 2/3 and released inmates from the county jail to reduce spending. Lane County released 96 prisoners from its prisons and laid off 40 law enforcement personnel to cut costs.|$|E
5|$|The Washington State Transportation Commission began seeking {{alternatives}} for the bridge replacement project in 1997, including a Sand Point crossing and various designs for a parallel replacement span. The alternatives were narrowed to a replacement span, with varying lane widths and configurations for interchanges in Seattle, in 2003. The project's preferred alternative, a replacement span with six lanes and a mixed-use trail, {{was chosen by}} WSDOT in 2011. The $4.56 billion megaproject, which encompasses the SR520 corridor between I-5 and I-405, was funded using a state <b>gas</b> <b>tax</b> and electronic tolls on the floating bridge introduced on December 29, 2011, to repay construction bonds over a 40-year period.|$|E

Voter rejection of 2002's Referendum 51, which would have funded the replacement of car ferries with a <b>gas</b> <b>tax,</b> led the state to consider eliminating passenger-only service to Bremerton and Vashon Island {{to make up for the}} shortfall. In May 2003, the state legislature approved cuts to ferry service, including the elimination of passenger-only ferries. Passenger-only ferry service ceased operations on September 20, 2003, and the MV Chinook and MV Snohomish were sold in 2008 to Golden Gate Ferries in the San Francisco Bay Area after an unsuccessful auction on eBay.|$|E

Later that year, the state switched paint colors for its centerlines; yellow {{was used for the}} lines separating directions of travel and white for lines separating lanes traveling in the same direction. Also in 1972, a <b>gas</b> <b>tax</b> increase was passed to facilitate US and state highway improvement projects. The final section of I-75 between Alger and Roscommon was opened on November 1, 1973, in a dedication by Governor William G. Milliken, completing the longest highway in the state. In 1974, the state implemented mileage-based exit numbers along the remaining Interstates in Michigan.

Instead, a sales tax increase of 1.25% was passed, with part of that dedicated to transportation.

However, Clark declared that he would govern as if he had a majority and refused to grant the small Social Credit caucus the official party status it wanted or make concessions to the party in order to gain its votes. Clark convinced one Socred MP, Richard Janelle from Lotbinière, to cross the floor and join the government caucus. In December 1979, the remaining five members of the Social Credit caucus demanded that the Conservatives amend their budget to allocate the controversial <b>gas</b> <b>tax</b> revenues to Quebec. Clark refused and the Socreds abstained in a vote on a Motion of non-confidence, which, along with several Conservative party members not being able to attend the vote, caused the government to fall.|$|E

25|$|As the CAHSR {{project was}} scaled back and rerouted to Pacheco Pass several years later, these plans were {{replaced}} with the more modest ACEforward program. The San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission issued a notice of intent to proceed with an Environmental Impact Statement in June 2013; this was released in 2017 and prioritized goals as either long term or short term. Short term goals include track improvements, a possible reroute through downtown Tracy including new stations, a West Tracy station, and a new extension to Modesto in addition to additional daily round trips. Long term goals include upgrades to the existing corridor to allow as many as 10 daily round trips, extension to Merced, tunnels under Altamont Pass, and electrification of the line from Stockton to San Jose. Also to be studied are possible connections with BART at Union City or Livermore via traditional ACE rail, diesel multiple units, or bus bridges. The state senate allocated $400 million in revenue from a <b>gas</b> <b>tax</b> increase to ACEforward expansion.|$|E
25|$|In 1921, the State Highway Board was {{replaced}} by the Washington Highway Committee and the Washington State Highways Department became a division of the Washington State Department of Public Works. The first <b>gas</b> <b>tax</b> (1¢ per gallon) was levied and Homer Hadley started planning a pontoon bridge across Lake Washington, which would later become the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge, which opened on July 2, 1940. In 1923, the State Highways Department separated from the Public Works Department and organized the first official system of highways, Washington's state road system. In 1926, the U.S. government approved the U.S. route system, which connected the country by road. 11 U.S. Routes entered Washington at the time. Later in 1929, the Highway Committee was merged with the State Highways Department. The Lake Washington Floating Bridge and the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge opened in 1940. The Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapsed because of winds on November 7, 1940, earning it the name Galloping Gertie. On June 29, 1956, President Dwight Eisenhower signed the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, which started the Interstate Highway System. Originally, 2 Interstates entered Washington.|$|E
500|$|MDOT hired a new consultant, Schimpeler/Coradino Associates, in 1984 {{to study}} the {{proposed}} freeway. The consultant recommended the freeway in March 1985. The South Beltline {{was included in the}} ten-year highway plan in 1986. By 1989, the state wanted to set the route in 1991 with construction starting in 1993. The freeway was studied as a possible toll road in June 1991 after three alternative routes were proposed the previous year. That September, the final route was set with a projected start date in 1997. The toll road concept was revived in September 1995 to offset the failure of a proposed <b>gas</b> <b>tax</b> increase. As a cost-saving measure, the number of interchanges was reduced to four from eight in June 1996. When a <b>gas</b> <b>tax</b> increase was passed in 1997, Governor John Engler promised at least seven access points for the freeway. The South Beltline was touted as [...] " [...] travel time around Grand Rapids virtually in half".|$|E
50|$|The {{state of}} Wisconsin {{maintains}} 158 state trunk highways, ranging from two-lane rural roads to limited-access freeways.
