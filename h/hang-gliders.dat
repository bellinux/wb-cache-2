5|$|Kalki Koechlin {{was born}} in Pondicherry, India, on 10 January 1984 to French parents, Joel Koechlin and Françoise Armandie, who came to India from Angers, France. She is a {{descendant}} of Maurice Koechlin, a French structural engineer who {{played an important role}} in the design and construction of the Eiffel Tower. Koechlin's parents are devotees of Sri Aurobindo. The family later settled in Kallatty, a village near Ooty in Tamil Nadu, where Koechlin's father established a business designing <b>hang-gliders</b> and ultralight aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The woodless eastern plateau, {{which is}} called Osterwiese or Röckinger {{mountain}} {{is the most important}} area for tourism. This section serves as a launching zone for model planes and <b>hang-gliders</b> and as an observation platform. On especially clear days one can see the Zugspitze in the Alps can be seen.|$|E
25|$|In {{and around}} the Hesselberg area there are many trails. The two main trails have many signs {{containing}} information for the hiker. The geological nature trail, which is 3km long, leads from its starting point near Wittelshofen to the mountain's peak. The signs along the route tell of the geological history {{and structure of the}} mountain. The Hesselberg-trail forms a round-trip of Hesselberg's heights. Both trails are well combinable. The Osterwiese is meeting point for model plane pilots, the launch areas for <b>hang-gliders</b> and paragliders can be found there too. The regional gliding airfield is in nearby Irsingen. Sporting clays was prohibited by the Nature Conservation Agency due to lead exposure. The Hesselberg Tourist Office, the Bund Naturschutz in Bayern (Bavarian Nature Conservation Alliance) (Ansbach district group), and the Landesbund für Vogelschutz in Bayern (Bavarian State Bird Conservation Alliance) (Ansbach district group) organise guided excursions and walking tours. At the mountain's foot anglers can indulge their passion at the Wörnitz and Sulzach rivers. The German Alpine Association (Hesselberg section with an office in Bechhofen) have built a small hut on the northern slope in order to support winter sports.|$|E
50|$|Mieroszów {{is known}} for the Jatki {{mountain}} (also called the New Saddle) which has a perfectly profiled <b>hang-glider</b> and paraglider launching slope for south winds. This is an easy training slope with a <b>hang-glider</b> ramp, but experienced pilots have done some long unpowered flights from the site.|$|R

50|$|The {{windward}} slopes {{are popular}} with glider, <b>hang-glider</b> and paraglider pilots.|$|R
500|$|The two {{air sports}} {{that are most}} closely related to gliding are hang gliding and paragliding. Although all three sports rely on rising air, there are {{significant}} differences which are listed in detail in [...] The main difference is that both hang gliders and paragliders are simpler, less sophisticated and cheaper aircraft that use the pilot's feet as the undercarriage. All paragliders and most hang gliders have no protective structure around the pilot. However, the dividing line between basic gliders and sophisticated <b>hang-gliders</b> is becoming less distinct. For example, hang gliders typically use fabric wings, shaped over a framework, but hang gliders with rigid wings and three-axis controls are also available. The lower air speeds and lower glide ratios of typical hang gliders means that shorter cross-country distances are flown than in modern gliders. Paragliders are more basic craft. They are also foot-launched, but their wings usually have no frames and their shape is created by the flow and pressure of air. The airspeeds and glide ratios of paragliders are generally lower still than the typical hang gliders, and so their cross-country flights are even shorter. Radio-controlled gliding uses scale-models of gliders mainly for ridge soaring; however thermic aeromodelling craft are also used.|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes a name {{given to}} one {{well-known}} {{member of a}} species, is used to mean any member of that species. For example, Old Norse valr means [...] "falcon", but Old Norse mythology mentions a horse named Valr, and thus in Old Norse poetry valr is sometimes used to mean [...] "horse". A modern {{example of this is}} an ad hoc usage by a helicopter ambulance pilot: [...] "the Heathrow of hang gliders" [...] for the hills behind Hawes in Yorkshire in England, when he found the air over the emergency site crowded with <b>hang-gliders.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Jakobshorn {{is also a}} favoured {{take-off}} point for <b>hang-gliders</b> and snowkiters.|$|E
50|$|The Italian <b>hang-glider</b> pilot Angelo d'Arrigo {{extended}} this technique. D'Arrigo {{noted that}} the flight of a non-motorised <b>hang-glider</b> {{is very similar to}} the flight patterns of migratory birds: Both use updrafts of hot air (thermal currents) to gain altitude that then permits soaring flight over distance. He used this fact to enable the re-introduction into the wild of threatened species of raptors.|$|R

50|$|It was {{not only}} in the field of {{astronomy}} that Prof. Radhakrishnan kept his mark but also in the designing and fabricating <b>hang-gliders,</b> micro-light aircraft and sailboats. His original contributions in these fields were acknowledged by the Government of India by way of support from the Aeronautics Research Development Board, Ministry of Defence (for designing <b>hang-gliders)</b> and ISRO (for sailboats).|$|E
50|$|Quirk's 2009 novel Exult tells a {{story of}} love, death, and hope among a {{community}} of <b>hang-gliders.</b>|$|E

50|$|After the war, in France the Besson H-3 private tourer flew in 1921. And in 1923 the German <b>hang-glider</b> enthusiast Hans Richter flew a triplane variant.|$|R
40|$|The {{main goal}} of the {{proposed}} paper is the numerical and experimental investigation of multiple winglets influence on the reduction of induced drag. This results in the improvement of climbing performances of a motorglider or <b>hang-glider.</b> In a precedent work [1] a set of multiple winglets, {{very similar to the}} bird tip feathers called remiges, were designed and optimized for the <b>hang-glider</b> belonging to Angelo D’Arrigo, a world champion <b>hang-glider</b> pilot and record holder. The research aims was to optimize the CL 1, 5 /CD parameter since this is directly proportional to the sink rate. In this work the effects of the multiple winglets, set on an elliptical wing and tested in a wind tunnel, are compared to the effects of three different single ‘classical’ winglets that were designed using a panel method code and were also tested in the same wind tunnel in order to compare their span efficiency to the one of the multiple winglets...|$|R
50|$|Rapla Airfield is used {{mainly as}} a drop zone by skydivers, by small {{airplane}} and ultra-light owners, by model plane pilots, by <b>hang-glider</b> and glider pilots and by powered para-glider pilots.|$|R
50|$|Items {{exceeding}} the weight or size parameters, including furniture, canoes, <b>hang-gliders</b> and large musical instruments, {{had to be}} issued with a ticket at the standard adult rate.|$|E
50|$|Because {{the range}} is a {{protected}} wilderness area, motorized trail bikes, motorcycles, three- and four-wheelers, snowmobiles, <b>hang-gliders</b> and mountain bikes are not permitted. Getting caught with one {{will result in}} a ticket.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hang-gliders,</b> {{when the}} sport was new, {{used to test}} fly off the North side {{although}} there is no safe direction to go; at least one hang-glider has been seriously injured upon ensnaring in power lines over West Genesee St.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s, McKinney {{became an}} {{accomplished}} mountain climber. In 1986 he led {{an expedition to}} Mount Everest, during which {{he became the first}} person to fly a <b>hang-glider</b> off the mountain.|$|R
40|$|This paper shows, how {{the most}} {{important}} parameters of a two-body system like a <b>hang-glider,</b> can be identified. The {{first step is to}} develop a simulation program with an acceptable reality model. Such a model involves a lot of constants. I carried out an investigation of sensitivity ir; order to select the constants that are {{the most important}} to specify. The results show that the aerodynamic constant c mq has the most significant effect on a  phygoidal oscillation. I have developed an identification program and a measuring system to determine the real value of this constant as well as the <b>hang-glider's</b> other aerodynamical and stability parameters...|$|R
50|$|Piccard {{obtained}} {{licenses to}} fly balloons, airplanes, gliders, and motorized gliders. In Europe, {{he was one}} of the pioneers of hang gliding and microlight flying during the 1970s. He became the European <b>hang-glider</b> aerobatics champion in 1985.|$|R
50|$|As {{most of the}} Mission Mountains {{fall under}} special protection, land use is limited largely to recreation. Motorized trail bikes, motorcycles, three- and-four-wheelers, snowmobiles, <b>hang-gliders</b> and {{mountain}} bikes are not permitted. Getting caught with one {{will result in a}} ticket.|$|E
50|$|The plateau, {{situated}} {{below the}} Fiz mountain range, {{is very popular}} with paragliders and <b>hang-gliders,</b> and hosts the largest paragliding school in France. In the 1950s the plateau was serviced by a cable car from Chedde, but this no longer exists.|$|E
50|$|The {{wings of}} a {{fixed-wing}} aircraft are not necessarily rigid; kites, <b>hang-gliders,</b> variable-sweep wing aircraft and aeroplanes using wing-warping are all fixed-wing aircraft.Most fixed-wing aircraft are flown by a pilot on board the aircraft, but some {{are designed to be}} remotely or computer-controlled.|$|E
50|$|Herring's {{defenders}} {{point out}} that <b>hang-glider</b> fliers today steer their aircraft by shifting their body, as Herring did. This method was superseded by the Wright Brothers system of dynamic three axis control used by all aircraft flying today.|$|R
50|$|Hang gliding {{is a close}} cousin, and <b>hang-glider</b> and {{paraglider}} launches {{are often}} found in proximity to one another. Despite the considerable difference in equipment, the two activities offer similar pleasures, and some pilots are involved in both sports.|$|R
50|$|Steve and Rodney are two ex-Vietnam commandos who do stunt {{work for}} television. They are {{hired by the}} {{government}} to raid the island stronghold of a Filipino racketeer and secure papers from his safe. The two men make the raid and escape using a <b>hang-glider.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The park {{is popular}} with <b>hang-gliders,</b> paragliders, and kite flyers. It {{is also a}} popular spot from which to watch the sun set. [...] Surfers {{frequent}} Marina State Beach due to its reliable waves. The 170 acre park was established in 1977.|$|E

50|$|Steep {{hills and}} deep valleys {{surround}} the village. Belchford {{lies in the}} Lincolnshire Wolds, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty running from Louth in the north, to Horncastle in the south. The village attracts ramblers, and <b>hang-gliders</b> who use the ridges from the Bluestone Heath Road to launch into the valley.|$|E
25|$|The aircraft, piloted by amateur cyclist and <b>hang-glider</b> pilot Bryan Allen, won {{the first}} Kremer prize on August 23, 1977 by {{completing}} a figure-eight course specified by the Royal Aeronautical Society, at Minter Field in Shafter, California. It was capable of taking off under human power.|$|R
50|$|Milk Hill was the {{starting}} point for longest <b>hang-glider</b> flight ever in the UK on May 10th, 2011 by Nev Almond. It was also {{the starting}} point for the longest paraglider flight in the UK, by Mark Watts on 3rd August 2014: 275.5 kilometres, to near Felbrigg in Norfolk.|$|R
50|$|Sport flying also developed, {{with both}} powered {{aeroplanes}} and gliders becoming more sophisticated. The introduction of glass fibre construction allowed sailplanes to achieve new levels of performance. In the 1960s the re-introduction of the <b>hang-glider,</b> now using the flexible Rogallo wing, {{ushered in a}} new era of ultralight aircraft.|$|R
