5|$|The pilot {{operated}} the controls at the bows of the <b>gondola,</b> {{forward of the}} engine, while the engineer controlled the engine from his position at the stern. A 52-kilowatt (70hp) Panhard et Levassor four-cylinder engine running at 1,000rpm, mounted centrally in the <b>gondola,</b> drove two 2.6-metre (8.5ft) diameter, two-bladed steel propellers that were mounted on cantilever arms, one on each side, rotating at 1,000–1,200rpm in opposite directions to prevent torque forces from twisting the airship. The exhaust pipe, below {{the rear of the}} <b>gondola,</b> was covered with metal gauze and pointed downwards to minimise the fire risk. The fuel tank, with a capacity in excess of 280L (61.6gal), was housed below the <b>gondola</b> within a pyramid of steel tubing that was designed to protect the <b>gondola</b> and the propellers during landing.|$|E
5|$|All the WindSeekers have {{speakers}} {{mounted to}} the inside of the <b>gondola</b> structure. They play 18 different tracks, among which are Hedwig's theme from the Harry Potter films, the theme songs from E.T., , and Superman, and songs from Flight of the Valkyries. At Cedar Point and Kings Island, the WindSeeker sign changes colors during night operation. At Cedar Point, as the <b>gondola</b> makes its way up the tower, the LED lights at the top of the tower go out, making the tower invisible, though the LED lights on the <b>gondola</b> remains lit. When the <b>gondola</b> comes back down, the lights at the top of the tower come on again. At Canada's Wonderland, the LED lights at the top of the tower remain on throughout the cycle, keeping the tower visible at all times.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} many minor {{problems}} all WindSeekers had in 2011, the first major accident occurred on June 2, 2012, on the Cedar Point installation. According to numerous news and rider reports, WindSeeker operated normally as the <b>gondola</b> made its way up the tower. Attached to the tower and <b>gondola</b> are a set of electrical cables that are located inside a plastic casing and are secured by two side panels to prevent the cables from moving around. At {{the top of the}} tower, winds were reportedly strong enough to push the electrical cables out of the socket on the tower causing the cables to move around freely. According to a rider riding WindSeeker {{at the time of the}} accident, as the <b>gondola</b> made its way back down the tower, the cables got stuck in the rotating <b>gondola.</b> The plastic casing began to be ripped apart as well as the cables causing the ride to come to a complete stop just over halfway up the tower. Because the electrical cables had been damaged, Cedar Point employees had to manually bring down the <b>gondola.</b> Riders were stuck on the ride for over an hour and no one was injured. WindSeeker at Cedar Point remained closed until the cause of the accident was found and fixed. The ride reopened on June 5, 2012.|$|E

5000|$|After the {{elimination}} of the traditional felze—possibly in response to tourists' complaining that it blocked the view—there survived for some decades a kind of vestigial summer awning, known as the [...] "tendalin" [...] (these can be seen on <b>gondolas</b> as late as the mid-1950s, in the film Summertime (1955)). While in previous centuries <b>gondolas</b> could be many different colors, a sumptuary law of Venice required that <b>gondolas</b> should be painted black, and they are customarily so painted now.|$|R

5|$|Details of the railroad's {{rolling stock}} are obscure. In 1891, it owned five {{passenger}} and three freight cars. In {{addition to the}} coaches that supported passenger runs to Wopsononock and Dougherty (fourteen trains per day during the 1899 season), the railroad {{had at least one}} parlor car and several Brill-built observation cars. Contemporary photographs show that the railroad built some of its own open-air cars for excursion service. Photographs taken after the destruction of the Wopsononock Hotel and the decline in passenger traffic show a number of <b>gondola</b> cars for coal traffic. The railroad continued to maintain a standard gauge <b>gondola</b> fleet {{in the last years of}} its existence.|$|E

5|$|In Taiwan, {{the threat}} of Fanapi forced the closure of rail lines and {{cancellation}} of flights from Kaohsiung International Airport, and at least 156flights were canceled. The storm caused the Kaohsiung seaport in southern Taiwan to close, thus delaying shipments from nearby chemical plants. Many boats rode out the storm at port. Portions of the Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit system suspended their service, and the Maokong <b>Gondola</b> was shut down during the storm.|$|E

5|$|The {{addition}} of the Grand Canyon Diorama in 1958 prompted changes to the Retlaw 2 freight train pulled by the DRR's No. 1 locomotive, which involved adding side-facing bench seating pointed towards Disneyland and red-and-white striped awnings {{on all of the}} cattle cars and gondolas. The walls on the cattle cars facing the park were also removed to allow for better views of the diorama. That same year, a third <b>gondola</b> with the same modifications as the other gondolas was added, and a fourth <b>gondola</b> with the same attributes was added in 1959. This brought the total number of freight cars in the train set, now referred to by Disneyland employees as Holiday Red, to eight. Prior to these modifications, the cattle cars and gondolas of this train set had no seating, requiring passengers to stand {{for the duration of the}} ride. Despite safety concerns voiced by Ward Kimball related to the lack of seats on these train cars, Walt Disney, for the purpose of authenticity, had insisted that there be no seats on them; he wanted the passengers to feel like cattle on an actual cattle train.|$|E
5|$|The area {{also has}} many {{opportunities}} for both alpine and Nordic skiing. The bowl of Tuckerman Ravine {{is famous for its}} extremely steep backcountry skiing. Long lines are common during the peak spring-skiing season of April and May. Wildcat Mountain offers groomed ski trails and lifts, and is a better choice for less-experienced skiers. The centerpiece of the ski-area is the <b>gondola,</b> which runs during the summer, and offers views of the Presidentials with no expended effort.|$|E

5|$|After the festival, the Wagner family {{journeyed to}} Venice for the winter.

The legend that the attack was {{prompted}} by argument with Cosima over Wagner's supposedly amorous interest in the singer Carrie Pringle, who had been a Flower-maiden in Parsifal at Bayreuth, is without credible evidence. After a funerary <b>gondola</b> bore Wagner's remains over the Grand Canal, his body was taken to Germany where it was buried in the garden of the Villa Wahnfried in Bayreuth.|$|E
5|$|On September 20, {{the tower}} for Falcon's Fury was shipped from Spain in nine sections, {{arriving}} at the park {{near the end of}} October; the ride's smaller parts had been delivered earlier from several European countries. Installation of one of the nine tower pieces was planned for every other night, with the last piece in place by New Year's Eve. Construction was done by the Adena Corporation, and on November 18 the first piece was installed. The ride's second piece was installed on December 2, and two more were installed by December 6. The fifth section was placed by December 21, and the sixth was erected by New Year's Day. The seventh tower piece was installed by January 3, 2014, and the eighth by January 5, reaching a height of about , and Falcon's Fury's <b>gondola</b> was seen at the park on January 12. The ride's counterweight was installed on January 22, and the tower was capped during the weekend of February 1. Work on the ride's electrical components then began. Assembly of the <b>gondola</b> was completed by the end of March. Testing was originally scheduled to begin in February, but due to construction delays the first drop tests were not made until April 15. Tower painting began in June, with its sunset motif estimated to take 60 hours over a three-week period.|$|E
