The number of U.S. tourists visiting Varadero, although increasing, {{has been limited}} because of the U.S. government restrictions that make it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>U.S.</b> citizens to visit Cuba as tourists.

25|$|The most {{important}} criticism of empirical views of mathematics is {{approximately the same}} as that raised against Mill. If mathematics is just as empirical as the other sciences, then this suggests that its results are just as fallible as theirs, and just as contingent. In Mill's case the empirical justification comes directly, while in Quine's case it comes indirectly, through the coherence of our scientific theory as a whole, i.e. consilience after E.O. Wilson. Quine suggests that mathematics seems completely certain because the role it plays in our web of belief is incredibly central, {{and that it would be}} extremely <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to revise it, though not impossible.|$|E

While they acknowledged that individual anchors might have idiosyncratic effects, “It is <b>difficult,</b> however, <b>for</b> <b>us</b> {{to believe that the}} chosen anchors plausibly could have serious, systematic effects” (Peterson et al. 1999, p.  244).|$|R

500|$|The studio {{version of}} the song was {{compiled}} from several different takes. It {{was one of several}} songs mixed by Steve Lillywhite in the final months of recording The Joshua Tree. Drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. later said of the song, [...] "It took so long to get that song right, it was <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to make any sense of it. It only became a truly great song through playing live. On the record, musically, it's not half the song it is live." ...|$|E
500|$|Poe {{describes}} his method in writing [...] "The Raven" [...] {{in the essay}} [...] "The Philosophy of Composition", and {{he claims to have}} strictly followed this method. It has been questioned whether he really followed this system, however. T. S. Eliot said: [...] "It is <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to read that essay without reflecting that if Poe plotted out his poem with such calculation, he might have taken a little more pains over it: the result hardly does credit to the method." [...] Biographer Joseph Wood Krutch described the essay as [...] "a rather highly ingenious exercise in the art of rationalization".|$|E
500|$|Gordon {{praised the}} episode's ending, saying [...] "I think we're {{most proud of}} the ending: Mulder's quest is re-established (and Daniel Sackheim {{directed}} it beautifully) with Mulder sitting alone in a church with only his faith. The story, again, was fueled by Mulder's belief and emotional connection with this case. Another girl taken from her family. And, in a way, the little boy who is the conduit, who is also perhaps touched by the aliens, is essentially Mulder. These little touches the fans seem to respond to. It was <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>us,</b> {{but in the end}} satisfying. It came out of frustration on our parts, and creative uncertainty".|$|E

500|$|Shortly after Xenogears was released, {{there was}} {{speculation}} of a sequel being released, although this never occurred. In 1999, Tanaka {{said that a}} project related to Xenogears was being developed. He also revealed that a sequel to Xenogears was initially planned, but never came to be. While Xenogears has never had an official sequel or prequel, there was wide speculation that Namco and Monolith Soft's Xenosaga was a prequel {{when it was first}} announced. Tetsuya Takahashi was the director and writer for both Xenogears and Xenosaga and has noted that [...] "with our relation between Square, I think it is <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to say it is a direct sequel or prequel". Approximately twenty members of the Xenosaga development staff had previously worked on Xenogears.|$|E
500|$|In July 2013, D’Esposito {{said he had}} {{considered}} making stand-alone shorts for several characters, including Loki, a young Nick Fury, Black Panther, Ms. Marvel, and Black Widow. Regarding Loki, D’Esposito said [...] "Being on Asgard is very <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> {{to do in a}} short. It’s just impossible for us cost wise. The short would be 30 seconds, and it’s over. One shot of Loki on Asgard." [...] On Fury and Black Panther, he remarked [...] "It’s very complicated to do: who plays those characters? And designing the costume, getting it going … We tried. We were there in development, and we tried, but they were very difficult for all the reasons I gave. And we don’t want to do something that’s half baked because it’s not good for us and it’s not good for our fans." [...] In February 2014, Pearce mentioned other shorts that he had written that never came to fruition, including ones based on Sin and Crossbones, Jessica Jones, and Damage Control.|$|E
500|$|Morgan {{was also}} called upon on {{occasion}} {{to deal with}} Montgomery, with whom his professional relationship as {{deputy chief of staff}} was similar to that before the war when Montgomery was a brigade commander. On one occasion Morgan was summoned to Smith's office to find him white with rage at a telephone receiver. [...] "That's your bloody marshal {{on the other end of}} that," [...] Smith explained. [...] "I can't talk to him any more. Now you go on." [...] "As the campaign progressed," [...] Morgan later wrote, [...] "it became more <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> British at SHAEF to provide explanation, as we were continually called upon to do, for the attitude and behaviour of the British authorities as exemplified by their chosen representative in the field." [...] Senior British officers at SHAEF, notably Morgan, Kenneth Strong and Jock Whiteley remained loyal to Eisenhower. This cast a pall over their careers after the war, when Montgomery became Chief of the Imperial General Staff.|$|E
60|$|When I had thus {{viewed the}} situation, {{it did not}} appear such a <b>difficult</b> matter <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to gain a station to the southward of Thayendanega's encampment; but coming across Jacob was quite a {{different}} proposition.

5000|$|In a Feb. 6, 2012, speech, Bullard {{noted that}} the [...] "large output gap" [...] view is a reason some cite for keeping nominal {{interest}} rates near zero for an indefinite period.

2500|$|In the 1840s railway mania hit Torquay, it is <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> now {{to imagine}} how {{important}} railways were to the 19th century, perhaps the situation was best described by a noted English historian G.M.

Rumsfeld suggested that if U.S.-Iraq relations could improve the U.S. might support a new oil pipeline across Jordan, which Iraq had opposed but was now willing to reconsider. Rumsfeld also informed Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz that [...] "Our efforts to assist were inhibited by certain things that made it <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> ... citing the use of chemical weapons." ...|$|E

2500|$|Game {{director}} Justin Richmond {{explained that}} the game feels more open than other Uncharted games mainly due to the great new character creation feature. [...] "We're not an open-world game, we're {{never going to be}} an open-world game but; we can try. It's still up in the air how much gameplay we're going to let you wander around. But we aim to let you just ride a thousand miles off into the middle of nowhere and still find action and adventure as you go." [...] Ultimately the feel we want to get is, yeah, your character is lost in the desert. So it needs to feel like that. We aim to make it feel open-world." [...] In regards to whether or not PlayStation Move would be supported in Uncharted 3, Naughty Dog explained that [...] "A great Move game is a game made around Move and we started Uncharted long before that. It would be very <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to adjust it. We tried a couple of things but it wasn't making a lot of sense." ...|$|E
2500|$|When the Wu generals {{wanted to}} respond to the enemy's taunts, Lu Xun said, [...] "This must be a trick. We should observe first." [...] Earlier on, when the Shu army first arrived at Yiling, the Wu generals wanted to attack the enemy, but Lu Xun objected and said, [...] "Liu Bei is leading an army east to attack us and his army's morale is very high. Besides, his forces are based in high and mountainous terrain, so it's <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> to attack them. Even if we manage to win, we can't {{completely}} defeat them. If we suffer any setback, our morale will be greatly affected and this isn't a small issue. Now, we should raise our troops' morale and make plans while waiting for changes in the situation. If we're on plains and flat ground, we should be worrying about sustaining heavy losses in skirmishes and charges. However, since the enemy is on mountainous terrain, they can't carry out an all-out assault because they're sandwiched between wood and rocks. We should take advantage of this weakness of theirs." [...] The Wu generals did not understand Lu Xun's reasoning and thought that he feared the enemy so they were very disgruntled with him.|$|E
