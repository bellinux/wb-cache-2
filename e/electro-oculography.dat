40|$|Conclusion. This {{study on}} eye {{motility}} demonstrates a new application of <b>electro-oculography</b> which proved {{to have a}} high potential for establishing and diagnosing the cause of diplopia in orbital floor fractures. <b>Electro-oculography</b> is objective and easy to perform even when the restricted eye is covered. The ‘uninjured ’ eye can be used as the reference. Any motility difference between {{the left and the right}} eye was easily detected. Objective. It is essential in orbital floor fractures to distinguish entrapment from other causes of diplopia. We investigated whether vertical eye motility and restricted elevation can be detected and characterized by means of <b>electro-oculography.</b> Materials and methods. Electronystagmography equipment used for vestibular testing in daily ENT practice was used in a different context. Unilateral mechanical restriction was generated in the test subjects through fixation of one eye bulb. The velocity and range of eye motility of both eyes were measured and compared in 12 healthy test subjects and 7 patients with long-term vertical diplopia after orbital floor fractures. Results. Simulated entrapment was easily detected as a distinct difference between right and left eye motility recordings (pB/ 0. 001). Recordings of patients with diplopia differed significantly from those of healthy test subjects with respect to velocity (pB/ 0. 05) and range of motility (pB/ 0. 05) ...|$|E

The former enables a user to move a computer cursor or to control a machine using only eye-gaze, regardless of drifting signal and blinking artifacts. In contrast, the latter output an ON/OFF signal only. Although it has the least simple function, it enables every user easily to turn ON/OFF a nurse-call device or to send one bit signal to a personal computer with high stability and reliability.

30|$|There {{are four}} types of eye {{tracking}} technologies: limbus tracking, image tracking, <b>electro-oculography,</b> and corneal reflection. Limbus tracking devices use infrared LEDs and photo-transistors to track the gaze through the reflection off of the iris and sclera of the infrared light off the eye. The image tracking devices use a camera to detect the gaze direction. <b>Electro-oculography</b> devices use electrodes placed near the eye to detect electrical potential between the cornea and retina to determine eye movement and gaze. Corneal reflection devices utilize the reflection of light off the convex cornea surface. The BioMuse (BioControl Systems, Bellevue, WA, USA) is an <b>electro-oculography</b> device that is available for eye tracking. The BioMuse allows for eye tracking; however, the vertical movements become unreliable due to the reflex motion of blinking [127]. The Headhunter Head and Eye Tracking System (ISCAN, Inc., Woburn, MA, USA) is a limbus tracking device [128]. It tracks the reflection of infrared light off the cornea or pupil. The EyeGaze System (LC Technologies, Inc., Fairfax, VA, USA) is also an image tracking [129]. The center of {{the lens of the}} eye is illuminated with IR light. A camera then processes the reflection off of the eye and determines the gaze direction. The Dual Purkinje Image Eye Tracker (Fourward Optical Technologies, Inc., Buena Vista, VA, USA) utilizes the Purkinje image to determine eye gaze. The Purkinje 1 reflection is compared to the Purkinje 4 reflection to determine the gaze direction.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION [...] Elderly {{patients}} with isolated acute vertigo are commonly encountered in clinical practice, but {{little is known}} about the underlying cause of the symptoms. MATERIAL & METHODS [...] We prospectively studied 24 patients aged 50 - 75 years with the acute onset of isolated vertigo lasting > 48 h and no abnormality on neurological examination other than nystagmus. The study protocol included neuro-imaging (MRI 22 patients, CT 2 patients), Doppler sonography, and <b>electro-oculography.</b> RESULTS [...] MRI/CT showed the presence of an infarction of the caudal cerebellum in six patients (25 %), 3 of whom had a potential cardioembolic source and normal Doppler sonography findings, whereas 3 patients had ipsilateral vertebral artery occlusion and normal cardiac findings. MRI of the posterior fossa was normal in 18 patients. On <b>electro-oculography,</b> ataxic pursuit eye movements was a characteristic finding in {{patients with}} cerebellar infarction, whereas caloric test findings were not discriminative.

METHODS: Sixteen {{members of a}} three-generation pedigree with autosomal dominant vitreoretinochoroidopathy were examined clinically, including measurement of the corneal diameter. In 14 persons, Goldmann perimetry, axial length determination and <b>electro-oculography</b> were carried out. Electroretinography, according to ISCEV standards, was performed in 11 of 12 affected persons. RESULTS: Characteristic annular peripheral pigmentary changes were present in all affected members, as well as chorioretinal atrophy varying from a tigroid aspect to marked atrophy. Four patients presented a microcornea and shallow anterior chamber without microphthalmia. The visual fields appeared to narrow with ageing. The <b>electro-oculography</b> was pathological in the affected patients and normal in the unaffected. The electroretinographic amplitude responses tended to worsen with age, with maintenance of near normal latencies. CONCLUSION: The clinical presentation of autosomal dominant vitreoretinopathy is variable. Electrooculography {{seems to be a}} discriminative test.

MethodsThis study was performed prospectively in a single tertiary hospital. The inclusion criteria for this study were as follows: (1) consecutive patients with epilepsy taking antiepileptic-drugs regularly for at least 1 year, (2) the absence of structural lesions on MRI, (3) an age ≥ 16 years old, (4) not using medications that could influence eye movement, and (5) a normal neurological examination. The latency, peak velocity and accuracy of the saccades and the gain of the pursuits were recorded by video-based <b>electro-oculography.</b> We analyzed the differences in the parameters of the eye movements for 75 patients with epilepsy and 20 normal controls matched for age and sex. ResultsThe total latency (1017. 7 ± 148. 9 ms vs. 1150. 7 ± 106. 6 ms, p= 0. 0003) and accuracy [370. 7 % (95 % CI 364. 1 – 376. 4 %, range 306 – 408. 2 %), 92. 7 % as total accuracy normalized value vs. 383. 6 % (95 % CI 378. 8 – 398 %, range 322. 9 – 417. 4 %), 95. 9 % as total accuracy normalized value, p= 0. 0005] were significantly different between the patients with epilepsy and normal controls.

40|$|BACKGROUND—Recent {{reports have}} {{established}} that eye changes occur in patients treated with vigabatrin.  AIM—To identify the eye changes associated with vigabatrin, {{based on a}} prospective study of children treated for seizures.  METHODS—Twenty nine children on vigabatrin (mainly as add on therapy) were followed up for 6. 5 years. Ophthalmic examination was performed before starting treatment and then six monthly in the outpatient clinic.  RESULTS—Twenty one children fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Most had epileptic syndromes with infantile spasms—namely West syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and partial seizures. Vigabatrin dose was 25 - 114 mg/kg/day (mean 55. 8); duration of therapy was 6 - 85 months (mean 35. 7). Four children (19 %) developed eye changes (retinal pigmentation, hypopigmented retinal spots, vascular sheathing, and optic atrophy). Visual evoked potentials were abnormal in 16 children. Electroretinography and <b>electro-oculography,</b> which could have picked up eye changes in early stages, were not performed, as this facility was not available.  CONCLUSIONS—Vigabatrin causes eye damage. Most children with epileptic syndromes on vigabatrin cannot complain of their eye problems, hence 3 - 6 monthly ophthalmic follow up is strongly advised, along with regular electroretinography, <b>electro-oculography,</b> and visual evoked potentials if possible. ...|$|E

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the complexity of}} vestibular–ocular reflex (VOR) in patients with acute unilateral vestibular loss (AUVL) via entropy analysis of head impulses. Methods: Horizontal head impulse test (HIT) with high-velocity alternating directions {{was used to evaluate}} 12 participants with AUVL and 16 healthy volunteers. Wireless <b>electro-oculography</b> and electronic gyrometry were used to acquire eye positional signals and head velocity signals. The eye velocity signals were then obtained through differentiation, band-pass filtering. The approximate entropy of eye velocity to head velocity (RApEn) was used to evaluate chaos property. VOR gain, gain asymmetry ratio, and RApEn asymmetry ratio were also used to compare the groups. Results: For the lesion-side HIT of the patient group, the mean VOR gain was significantly lower and the mean RApEn was significantly greater compared with both nonlesion-side HIT and healthy controls (p < 0. 01, one-way analysis of variance). Both the RApEn asymmetry ratio and gain asymmetry ratio of the AUVL group were significantly greater compared with those of the control group (p < 0. 05, independent sample t test).
