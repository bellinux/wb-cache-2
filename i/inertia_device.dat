40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare the force outputs {{achieved}} during a squat exercise using a rotational <b>inertia</b> <b>device</b> in stable versus unstable conditions with different loads and in concentric and eccentric phases. Thirteen male athletes (mean ± SD: age 23. 7 ± 3. 0 years, height 1. 80 ± 0. 08 m, body mass 77. 4 ± 7. 9 kg) were assessed while squatting, performing one set of three repetitions with four different loads under stable and unstable conditions at maximum concentric effort. Overall, there were no significant differences between the stable and unstable conditions at each of the loads for any of the dependent variables. Mean force showed significant differences between some of the loads in stable and unstable conditions (P < 0. 010) and peak force output differed between all loads for each condition (P < 0. 045). Mean force outputs were greater in the concentric than in the eccentric phase under both conditions and with all loads (P < 0. 001). There were no significant differences in peak force between concentric and eccentric phases at any load in either stable or unstable conditions. In conclusion, squatting with a rotational <b>inertia</b> <b>device</b> allowed the generation of similar force outputs under stable and unstable conditions at each of the four loads. The study also provides empirical evidence of the different force outputs achieved by adjusting load conditions on the rotational <b>inertia</b> <b>device</b> when performing squats, especially in the case of peak force. Concentric force outputs were significantly higher than eccentric outputs, except for peak force under both conditions. These findings support the use of the rotational <b>inertia</b> <b>device</b> to train the squatting exercise under unstable conditions for strength and conditioning trainers. The device could also be included in injury prevention programs for muscle lesions and ankle and knee joint injuries...|$|E
40|$|The Inertia Coupled Rimless (ICR) {{wheel is}} a {{mechanically}} simple walking device capable of energy efficient motion. Typically, walking robots that {{are capable of}} level ground transport are extremely energy inefficient. To address this performance issue, the ICR wheel was examined while considering real-world frictional losses. The ICR wheel has been previously shown to be capable of collisionless, periodic motion, but until now, the ICR wheel had only been examined as an ideal, theoretical model. The <b>inertia</b> <b>device</b> within the system was tested to determine both the magnitude of energy loss due to damping and a suitable model for its motion. Fitting friction models to the experimental results showed that the a visciously damped model most accurately represented the system 2 ̆ 7 s motion. Simulations revealed that the ICR wheel with friction would be capable of walking passively on a ramp with half stable, periodic walking, but the collisionless motion was lost. An actuation scheme was designed in simulation to allow an ICR wheel with damping to achieve collisionless motion on level ground. Experimental testing of a passive ICR wheel on a 3 ^o ramp showed that a cost of transport of at least 0. 052 is possible with this system. Simulations suggest that, with the inclusion of an actuation scheme, the cost of transport for the same system on level ground could be as low as 0. 024. Understanding how to overcome frictional losses lays the foundation {{for the creation of a}} walking robot capable of level ground transport with significantly less energy use than current models are capable of achieving...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{recognized}} principal issues brought {{along by the}} steadfast migration towards power electronic interfaced energy sources {{is the loss of}} rotational inertia. In conventional power systems, the inertia of the synchronous machines plays a crucial role in safeguarding against any drastic variations in frequency by acting as a buffer in the event of large and sudden power generation-demand imbalances. In future power electronic based power systems, the same role can be played by strategically located virtual <b>inertia</b> <b>devices.</b> However, the question looms large as to how the system operators would procure and pay for these devices. In this article, we propose a market mechanism inspired by the ancillary service markets in power supply. We consider a linear network-reduced power system model along with a robust H 2 performance metric penalizing the worst-case primary control effort. With a social welfare maximization problem for the system operator as a benchmark, we construct a market mechanism in which bids are invited from agents providing virtual inertia, who in turn are compensated via a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves payment rule. The resulting mechanism ensures truthful bidding to be the dominant bidding strategy and guarantees non-negative payoffs for the agents. A three-region case study is considered in simulations, and a comparison with a regulatory approach to the same problem is presented...|$|R

40|$|A {{method for}} {{measuring}} the moment of inertia of an object using a five-wire torsion pendulum design is described here. Typical moment of <b>inertia</b> measurement <b>devices</b> are capable of 1 part in 10 (exp 3) accuracy and {{current state of the}} art techniques have capabilities of about one part in 10 (exp 4). The five-wire apparatus design shows the prospect of improving on current state of the art. Current measurements using a laboratory prototype indicate a moment of inertia measurement precision better than a part in 10 (exp 4). In addition, the apparatus is shown to be capable of measuring the mass center offset from the geometric center. Typical mass center measurement devices exhibit a measurement precision up to approximately 1 micrometer.

High stack power density is the main selling point of high-pressure systems. On the contrary, low-pressure systems have a benefit of low parasitic loss on air flow devices. Here, {{we look at the}} dynamic characteristics of both high-pressure and low-pressure systems. The model of a low-pressure air supply system with low-speed blowers is developed. We then perform a dynamical analysis comparing the low pressure system with the highpressure system equipped with a high-speed compressor. The differences in the transient behavior of the two systems are investigated and their sensitivity to the flow <b>device</b> <b>inertia</b> and the supply manifold volume are explored. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{microfluidic}} <b>devices,</b> <b>inertia</b> drives particles {{to focus}} on a finite number of inertial focusing streamlines. Particles on the same streamline interact to form one-dimensional microfluidic crystals (or "particle trains"). Here we develop an asymptotic theory to describe the pairwise interactions underlying the formation of a 1 D crystal. Surprisingly, we show that particles assemble into stable equilibria, analogous to the motion of a damped spring. Although previously it has been assumed that particle spacings scale with particle diameters, we show that the equilibrium spacing of particles depends on the distance between the inertial focusing streamline and the nearest channel wall, and therefore can be controlled by tuning the particle radius.

It could navigate near harbors where several vessels run, or it could navigate through very narrow channels. In the conceptual design phase when the candidate design changes frequently according to the various performance requirements, it is very expensive and time-consuming to carry out model tests using a large model in a large towing tank and a free-running model test in a large maneuvering basin. In this paper, a new Planar Motion Mechanism(PMM) test in a Circulating Water Channel (CWC) was conducted {{in order to determine}} the hydrodynamic coefficients of the MH. To do this, PMM devices including three-component load cells and <b>inertia</b> tare <b>device</b> were designed and manufactured, and various tests of the MH such as static drift test, pure sway test, pure yaw test, and drift-and-yaw combined test were carried out.

Mechanical structures are based on one module per finger and can be scaled up to three fingers. Mechanical configurations for two and three fingers are based on the use of one and two redundant axes, respectively. As demonstrated, redundant axes significantly increase workspace and prevent link collisions, which is their main asset with respect to other multi-finger haptic devices. The location of redundant axes and link dimensions have been optimized in order to guarantee a proper workspace, manipulability, force capability, and <b>inertia</b> for the <b>device.</b> The mechanical haptic device design and a thimble adaptable to different finger sizes have also been developed for virtual object manipulation...|$|R

To realize an autonomous systems, a reliable patient monitoring technique which can automatically record and classify patient&# 039;s motion during training sessions is essential. In order to minimize the cost and operational complexity, the combination of non-visual based <b>inertia</b> sensing <b>devices</b> and pattern recognition algorithms are often considered more suitable in such applications. However, the high motion irregularity due to stroke patients&# 039; body function impairment has significantly increased the classification difficulty. A novel fuzzy kernel motion classifier specifically designed for stroke patient&# 039;s rehabilitation training motion classification is presented in this paper. The proposed classifier utilizes geometrically unconstrained fuzzy membership functions to address the motion class overlapping issue and thus it can achieve highly accurate motion classification even with poorly performed motion samples.

40|$|We {{propose a}} set of devices of simple {{geometrical}} design which may exhibit a permanent rotation due to quantum (vacuum) fluctuations. These objects - which have no moving parts - impose certain boundary conditions on quantum fluctuations thus affecting their vacuum energy similarly to the standard Casimir effect. The boundary conditions are chosen {{in such a way}} that the vacuum energy for a static device is larger compared to the energy of the vacuum fluctuations in a state when the device rotates about a certain axis. The optimal frequency of rotation is determined by geometry and moment of <b>inertia</b> of the <b>device.</b> We illustrate our ideas in a vacuum of a massless scalar field theory using simplest Dirichlet-type boundary conditions.

40|$|A novel, low inertia, two degree-of-freedom (2 -DOF) contact {{location}} display (CLD) device has been designed, prototyped, and tested. This device positions a small spherical contactor beneath the user’s fingerpad {{at the point}} of contact between the finger and a virtual surface. Kinesthetic forces are provided by a custom haptic device attached to the CLD. The contactor is remotely driven by push-pull wires to reduce the effective <b>inertia</b> of the <b>device</b> at the user’s fingertip; however, this design results in significant mechanical backlash. This backlash is characterized and partially compensated for in software. An experiment was used to evaluate several methods of rendering tactile feedback, each using a different method of prepositioning the contactor.

40|$|Passive, energy-dissipating {{actuators}} {{are promising}} for force-coordination training in stroke rehabilitation, {{as they are}} inherently safe and have a high torque-to-weight ratio. The goal {{of this study is}} to determine if hydraulic disk brakes are suitable to actuate an upper-extremity exoskeleton, for application in rehabilitation settings. Passive actuation with friction brakes has direct implications for joint control. Braking is always opposite to the movement direction. During standstill, the measured torque is equal to the torque applied by the human. During rotations, it is equal to the brake torque. Actively assisting movement is not possible, nor are energy-requiring virtual environments. The evaluated disk brake has a 20 Nm bandwidth (flat-spectrum, multi-sine) of 10 Hz; sufficient for torques required for conventional therapy and simple, passive virtual environments. The maximum static output torque is 120 Nm, sufficient for isometric training of the upper extremity. The minimal impedance is close zero, with only the <b>inertia</b> of the <b>device</b> felt. In conclusion, hydraulic disk brakes are suitable for rehabilitation devices...|$|R
40|$|Frequent and {{repetitive}} functional {{training of}} the upper limb is a key aspect of regaining independence after stroke. Traditionally, this is achieved through manual one-on-one therapy, but patients are often unable to get sufficient treatment due to budget and scheduling constraints. An ideal solution may be robotic therapy, which is becoming an increasingly viable tool. Unfortunately, current rehabilitation robots ignore shoulder girdle motion, even though it plays {{a critical role in}} stabilizing and orienting the upper limb during everyday movements. To address this issue, a new adjustable robotic exoskeleton is proposed that provides independent control of six degrees of freedom of the upper limb: two at the sternoclavicular joint, three at the glenohumeral joint and one at the elbow. Its joint axes are optimally arranged to mimic natural upper-limb range of motion without reaching singular configurations and while maximizing manipulability across the workspace. This joint configuration also permits reduction to planar shoulder/elbow motion in any plane by locking all but the last two joints. Electric motors actuate the mechanisms using cable and belt transmissions designed to maximize the load capabilities of the robot while maintaining backdriveability and minimizing <b>inertia.</b> The <b>device</b> will be able to operate both as an assessment tool and as a therapy tool by monitoring and assisting movements. It will also be able to provide any level of gravity compensation. Controlling the entire shoulder complex facilitates training with more natural movements, with the added benefit of gaining the ability to observe and prevent compensatory motion...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes three {{generator}} control {{strategies for}} Wells turbine-based floating oscillating wáter column (OWC) devices comprising electrical or mechanical energy storage systems. The first control strategy is indicated for low <b>inertia</b> turbine OWC <b>devices</b> that include ultracapacitors. This control law optimizes the power take-off efficiency {{by means of}} an instantaneous speed controller that allows variation of the turbine rotational speed in a wave-by-wave basis. In addition, the profile of the electrical power injected into the grid is smoothed, so that a high penetration of wave energy does not threaten the grid stability. The second and third control laws are developed for OWC systems comprising a flywheel. Quasi-constant and variable speed controllers are proposed. These control laws do not maximize the system efficiency but allow the use of simpler, smaller and cheaper power electronics. Additionally the power quality is also optimized.

40|$|Abstract—A very fast, low-cost, and {{reliable}} method to assemble micro structures suitable for MOEMS (micro-opto-electro-mechanical systems) applications is {{reported in this}} paper. In general, due to the minute scale of MEMS <b>devices,</b> <b>inertia</b> force is often neglected when dealing with MEMS components. However, we have demonstrated that inertia force can be significant even if the mass of micro structure is < 1 µg (a 250 µmx 100 µm mass with 3. 5 µm thick polysilicon and 0. 5 µm thick Au layers). At this scale, we have shown that, mass inertia force can overcome some surface forces and thus be used for non-contact self-assembly of MEMS structures. Centrifugal force was applied to MUMPs (Multi-User-MEMS-Processes) chips by attaching the chips to a rotating disc. The micro hinged structures on the chips were shown to self-assemble by rotating themselves 90 o out of substrate plane in most cases, and automatically lock themselves to designed latches. The assembly process is also applicable to complex dynamic micro mirror structures. Our experimental setup and systematic approach to acquire force data during the centrifugal assembly process is described in this paper.

40|$|In this work, we analyze {{anomalous}} effects {{observed in}} the operation of two different technological devices: a magnetic core and a parallel plate (symmetrical or asymmetrical) capacitor. From experimental measurements on both devices, we detected small raised anomalous forces that cannot be explained by known interactions in the traditional theories. As the variations of <b>device</b> <b>inertia</b> have not been completely understood by means of current theories, we here propose a theoretical framework in which the anomalous effects can consistently be explained by a preexisting state of quantum entanglement between the external environment and either magnetic dipoles of magnetic cores or electric dipoles of capacitors, so that the effects would be manifested by the application of a strong magnetic field on the former or an intense electric field on the latter. The values of the macroscopic observables calculated in such a theoretical framework revealed good agreement with the experimental measurements performed in both cases, so that the non - locality hypothesis based on the generalized quantum correlation between dipoles and environment is consistent as explanation for the anomalous effects observed. The control and enhancement of the effect can allow the future viability of a new technology based on electric propulsion of rockets and aircrafts. Comment: 23 pages, 5 tables and 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|To enable {{compliant}} training modes with {{a rehabilitation}} robot, an important prerequisite {{is that any}} undesired human-robot interaction forces caused by robot dynamics must be avoided, either by an appropriate mechanical design or by compensating control strategies. Our recently proposed control scheme of "Generalized Elasticities" employs potential fields to compensate for robot dynamics, including inertia, beyond {{what can be done}} using closed-loop force control. In this paper, we give a simple mechanical equivalent using the example of the gait rehabilitation robot Lokomat. The robot consists of an exoskeleton that is attached to a frame around the patient's pelvis. This frame is suspended by a springloaded parallelogram structure. The mechanism allows vertical displacement while providing almost constant robot gravity compensation. However, <b>inertia</b> of the <b>device</b> when the patient's pelvis moves up and down remains a source of large interaction forces, which are reflected in increased ground reaction forces. Here, we investigate an alternative suspension: To hide not only gravity, but also robot inertia during vertical pelvis motion, we suspend the robot frame by a stiff linear spring that allows the robot to oscillate vertically at an eigenfrequency close to the natural gait frequency. This mechanism reduces human-robot interaction forces, which is demonstrated in pilot experimental results...|$|R
40|$|At {{present on}} the basis of {{significant}} achievements in the field of high-temperature superconductivity more and more applications of this phenomenon appear in the electric power industry, in particular superconducting current limiters. To investigate current limitation process in electrical networks containing superconducting current limiter it is extremely important to evaluate the electrodynamic and thermal effects of the short-circuit current at any time. The existing superconducting current limiters mathematical models don't consider the <b>inertia</b> of the <b>device</b> transition from the superconducting state to the conducting one. It is necessary to develop the mathematical model for the electromagnetic transient process that can adequately simulate the superconducting current limiter at any time point, taking into account its parameters in the normal and emergency modes and also to describe these parameters dynamics during the process of current limitation. The proposed mathematical model allows to simulate the changing inertia of the superconducting current limiter inductive reactance, to analytically describe the electromagnetic transient process, and also to evaluate the electrodynamic and thermal effects of short-circuit current in networks with superconducting current limiter. The important feature of the mathematical model is the consideration of the increase rate (inertia) of the inductive reactance with respect to the external network.

40|$|Existing {{methods for}} {{performance}} and activity monitoring of court-based wheelchair {{sports such as}} wheelchair rugby during actual matches have their limitations. They either require too much manual efforts or they gather insufficient information. Inertia sensors {{have the ability to}} measure substantial amounts of movement data but there is no known method to decipher that huge amount of data for quantifying activity or performance. Based on literature, Fractal dimensions have been applied to signals of physical parameters measured as a time series in the field of sports, biomedical and manufacturing. In all these cases Fractal dimensions of the time-based signals were able to identify different states or conditions accurately. There are several methods of determining Fractal dimensions and for this study, two were narrowed down – one based on Renyi’s generalized dimension (S 0) and the other based on Hausdorff dimension (DH). A feasibility study was first conducted to investigate the Fractal dimensions of forward accelerations during manual wheelchair pushing using the two methods. The outcome showed that generally higher Fractal dimension values were linked to higher push amplitudes and frequencies or a higher activeness level. It was identified that S 0 related to energy released to the environment while DH showed a connection with activity level. This was then taken further by capturing forward/backward accelerations of wheelchairs during actual wheelchair rugby matches. S 0 and DH were calculated from the acceleration data, and four methods were developed using S 0 and DH values to identify and quantify activity and performance of the wheelchair rugby athletes. Those methods include cumulative plots of S 0 and DH; a Decision template formed using a 2 D plot of S 0 against DH, and Activities Ranking that is also based on the 2 D plot. After the basic process of the methods was developed, steps were taken to optimize the values of S 0 and DH such that they are optimal for the identification and quantification outcome of wheelchair rugby activities. The factors that influence S 0 and DH values include parameters of the <b>inertia</b> sensing <b>device</b> (sensor resolution and sampling rate), running average window width and amplitude multiplier for calculating DH. In the end, although the number of athletes that were tested was small, the analysis outcome supported results from previous studies where athletes of higher functional classifications showed higher performance. The analysis of activity ranking which had an accuracy of 95 % also highlighted that difference in activities between the athletes related highly with their functional classifications and their role or position in the team. The results of the analysis proved to be relevant for coaching, planning matches and even for talent identification...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{developments}} {{in the field of}} microfluidics have emerged several useful techniques for microparticle manipulation and cellular assays (e. g. mechanical, acoustic, hydrodynamic, magnetophoresis, and dielectrophoresis etc.). Among them, one is to use fluid <b>inertia</b> in “lab-on-a-chip” <b>devices.</b> Inertia-based methods are very popular due to the superior advantages, e. g., simplicity, passiveness, preciseness, continuity, and high-throughput. Two common channel structures: spiral and serpentine microchannels have been investigated intensively, and widely were reported. Recently, there are some reports to use obstacle structures patterned along one or two sides of the straight microchannel to focus and separate microparticles. However, after the microchannel and obstacles are designed and fabricated, its focusing pattern and performance on specific particles are settled. For new sets of microparticles, it has to design and fabricate new devices. In this work, I present a novel inertial platform for continuous, high-controllability, label-free particle and cell focusing and separation in the straight channel with symmetric semicircle obstacle arrays. The main objective of this research is to carry out a high-controllability inertial focusing and separation in the identical straight channel containing semicircle obstacles array. Three basic focusing patterns were observed: (i) single focusing streak at the straight channel center; (ii) two focusing streaks at two sidewalls; (iii) The transition of focusing streaks between pattern i and pattern ii. Firstly we investigated the three different focusing patterns in the straight microchannels with circular obstacles array by the theory of the static superposition of inertial lift force and secondary flow drag force. Besides, we implement a relative velocity gap between microspheres and fluid in a straight channel by exerting an electrophoresis (EP) force on the charged microparticles. Therefore, saffman lift force induced by relative velocity and fluid shear migrate particles towards or away from channel centerline along the lateral direction. The direction of saffman lift force depends on the vector product of relative velocity and shear rate. Two particles focusing streaks at two sidewalls can be altered by changing flow rate and magnitude of the voltage. This demonstrates the ii possibility to adjust particle inertial focusing pattern in the straight channel with obstacles array using Electrophoresis. Manipulation of lateral migration of focusing streaks increases controllability in an application such as blood cells filtration and separation cells by size. In summary, we hope that our study can not only reveal the new possible explanation of inertial focusing in simple straight channels with symmetric semicircle obstacle arrays, but also provide high controllability and versatile particle filtration and manipulation platforms, for the practical application of biological sample treatment and clinical blood cells filtration...|$|R
