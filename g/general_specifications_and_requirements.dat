40|$|The	 {{purpose of}} this	 {{document}} is to	review {{the requirements of}} the platform in terms of human factors issues that to be addressed,	 provide an update {{on the state of the}} art in augmented reality requirements and to	provide an early technical	specification. Addressing these issues will ensure that the platform can deliver its full potential when actually operated by the end-users. Indeed, a poorly designed system	will not only reduce utility	and acceptance of the platform but also induce discomfort	and	frustration. The	document keeps the	 requirements at a general level as it does not support specific use-case	 implementations. Instead	 this	 document provides a list of <b>general</b> <b>specifications</b> <b>and</b>	<b>requirements</b>	that	must	be	addressed in order for the eGlasses platform to be a success...|$|E

40|$|The Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) Safeguards and Seals Evaluation Program is {{evaluating}} new {{fiber optic}} active seal technologies for use at Department of Energy (DOE) facilities. The {{goal of the}} program is to investigate active seal technologies that can monitor secured containers storing special nuclear materials (SNM) within DOE vaults. Specifically investigated were active seal technologies that can be used as tamper-indicating devices to monitor secured containers within vaults while personnel remain outside the vault area. Such a system would allow minimal access into vaults while ensuring container content accountability. The purpose of this report is to discuss tamper-indicating devices that were evaluated for possible DOE use. While previous seal evaluations (Phase I and II) considered overall facility applications, this discussion focuses specifically on their use in vault storage situations. The report will highlight <b>general</b> background information, <b>specifications</b> <b>and</b> <b>requirements,</b> <b>and</b> test procedures. Also discussed are the systems available from four manufacturers: Interactive Technologies, Inc., Fiber SenSys, Inc., Inovonics, Inc., and Valve Security Systems...|$|R

40|$|During a TTS {{verification}} at Kårstø Processing Plant {{there where}} raised a non-conformity to Statoil <b>specification</b> <b>and</b> <b>requirements</b> {{with regard to}} temperature rise in substations when HVAC is shut down. One could not find any documentation on whether Statoil were compliant with <b>specifications</b> <b>and</b> <b>requirements.</b> This finding is further implemented and followed up as a deviation to TR 2237 [3] and in the Total Risk Analysis[App. D,D 04] at Kårstø Processing plant to a situation where gas is detected in the air intake of a substation and one have {{to shut down the}} HVAC. The purpose of this thesis is to find the temperature increase inside a substation when HVAC is shut down due to gas detected in the air intake. To find the temperature increase one have to identify heat load to the room and heat leaving the room. By comparing measurements, experimental data and a numerical analysis good enough to make decisions on when or if one have to close down the substation. Results from the numerical analysis will be seen in comparison with statutory regulations <b>and</b> internal <b>specifications</b> <b>and</b> <b>requirements.</b> Measurements <b>and</b> experiment were performed during normal operation of the plant, and it took place at one of the substations placed in or near area where one have the highest probability of seeing a gas leakage...|$|R
