2500|$|In April 2007, the New York Times {{reported}} that U.S. federal oversight inspectors found that [...] "in {{a sampling of}} eight projects that the United States had declared successes, seven were no longer operating as designed because of plumbing and electrical failures, lack of proper maintenance, apparent looting, and expensive equipment that lay idle. The United States has sometimes admitted... that some of its reconstruction projects have been abandoned, delayed, or poorly constructed.

[...] The resolution, which passed {{by a vote of}} 31–1 with 3 abstentions, also expressed [...] "serious concerns" [...] about Iran's nuclear program while desiring a peaceful resolution. [...] Senior United States diplomat Robert Wood blamed Iran for [...] "systematically demolishing" [...] a facility at the Parchin military base, which IAEA <b>inspectors</b> <b>have</b> attempted to visit in the past, but were not granted access, saying [...] "Iran has been taking measures that appear consistent with an effort to remove evidence of its past activities at Parchin."

2500|$|Every {{employer}} {{must provide}} a [...] "safe system of work". As {{the industrial revolution}} developed, accidents was labour law's first target. The Factories Acts, from 1802, required minimum standards in workplace cleanliness, ventilation, fencing machinery. It restricted child labour and limited the working day. They targeted mines, or textile mills, before the Factories Act 1961 spread to all [...] "factories": where an article is made or changed, or animals are kept and slaughtered. The Employer's Liability (Defective Equipment) Act 1969 made employers automatically liable for equipment with defects supplied by third parties. Because individual employees tend not to litigate, to ensure enforcement, there are inspectors under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, enforced by the Health and Safety Executive. The HSE can delegate enforcement to local authorities. <b>Inspectors</b> <b>have</b> the power to investigate and require changes to workplace systems. In addition, HSWA 1974 section 2 foresees that employees will {{set up their own}} workplace committees, elected by the employees and with the power to codetermine health and safety matters with management. Health and safety regulations remain in line with the European-wide harmonised requirements of the Health and Safety Directive.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{principal}} terms that accompanies the employment relationship is that the employer will provide a [...] "safe system of work". As the industrial revolution developed, accidents from a hazardous working environment were a front line target for labour legislation, {{as a series of}} Factories Acts, from 1802, required minimum standards in workplace cleanliness, ventilation, fencing machinery, not to mention restrictions on child labour and limits to the working day. These Acts typically targeted particular kinds of workplaces, such as mines, or textile mills, before the more generalised approach took hold now seen in the Factories Act 1961. That applies to any workplace where an article is made or changed, or animals are kept and slaughtered. The Employer's Liability (Defective Equipment) Act 1969 made employers automatically liable for equipment with defects supplied by third parties. Because isolated employees lack the technical skill, time, training to litigate, such regulation's primary line of enforcement was through inspectors or agencies before matters went to court. Today the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, enforced by the Health and Safety Executive, is the main law. The HSE can delegate enforcement to local authorities, whose <b>inspectors</b> <b>have</b> the power to investigate and require changes to workplace systems. In addition, HSWA 1974 section 2 foresees that employees will set up their own workplace committees, elected by the employees and with the power to codetermine health and safety matters with management. Spelling out the general duties found in HSWA 1974, are a set of health and safety regulations, which must also stay in line with the European-wide harmonised requirements of the Health and Safety Directive.|$|E

2500|$|In December, the ISIS {{said that}} Iran had {{produced}} 425 kilograms of uranium, and that Iran had [...] "not yet achieved a break-out capability", but that Iran may {{be close to}} a break-out capability. In response to statements that Iran had enough material to make a weapon, the Arms Control Association urged the U.S. and the media to exhibit greater care when making claims about Iran's nuclear program. Ivan Oelrich and Ivanka Barzashka, from the Federation of American Scientists, said that the [...] "simplistic calculations" [...] contained in the ISIS article were wrong because [...] "just taking the quantity of LEU and multiplying by the U-235 concentration does not work because {{not all of the}} U-235 is recovered". Cheryl Rofer, a retired 35 year researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory and former president of the Los Alamos Committee on Arms Control and International Security, has argued that for Iran to make a bomb from this material it would need to kick all the inspectors out of the country, reconfigure thousands of closely watched centrifuges, and then engage in years of enrichment. According to the American Institute of Physics, the most difficult step in building a nuclear weapon is the production of fissile material. Iran has enriched uranium to [...] "less than 5%", consistent with fuel for a nuclear power plant and well below the purity of WEU (around 90%) typically used in a weapons program. HEU with a purity of 20% or more is usable in a weapon, but this route is less desirable because far more material is required to obtain critical mass. [...] "Our production of a nuclear energy program is completely within the framework or structure of international laws," [...] said Ali Akbar Javanfekr, media adviser to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. David Albright, president of the group which published the report, maintained that Iran's enriched uranium meant that Israel was losing control over the timing of Iran's nuclear activities and that even Iran pretending to have a bomb would be a threat. The International Atomic Energy Agency said its <b>inspectors</b> <b>have</b> not found evidence to suggest that Iran is attempting to process low-enriched uranium into weapons-grade uranium, but expressed concern that Iran was still refusing to comply with the United Nation's requirement of ending its uranium enrichment activity.|$|E

6000|$|... "I'll be glad {{to explain}} that," [...] he eagerly replied, [...] "for I am quite proud of it, I assure you. There are many {{buildings}} throughout our larger cities that were erected as cheaply as possible and without a single thought {{for the safety of}} their tenants. So many disasters have resulted from this that of late years building <b>inspectors</b> <b>have</b> been appointed in every locality to insist on proper materials and mechanical efficiency in the erection of all classes of buildings. These inspectors, however, cannot tear the old buildings down to see if they are safe, and paint and plaster cover a multitude of sins of unscrupulous builders. Usually the landlord or owner knows well the condition of his property and in many cases refuses to put it into such shape as to insure the safety of his tenants. Greed, false economy and heartless indifference to the welfare of others are unfortunately too prevalent among the wealthy class. No ordinary argument could induce owners to expend money in strengthening or rebuilding their income-producing properties. But I get after them in my picture with a prod that ought to rouse them to action.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} role of {{repetition}} in government regulation. Using Florida restaurant inspection data from 2003 to 2010, we find that inspectors new to the inspected restaurant report 12. 7 - 17. 5 % more violations than the second visit of a repeat inspector. This effect is even more pronounced if the previous <b>inspector</b> <b>had</b> inspected the restaurant more times. The difference between new and repeat inspectors is driven partly by inspector heterogeneity in inherent taste and stringency, and partly by new <b>inspectors</b> <b>having</b> fresher eyes in the first visit of a restaurant. These findings highlight the importance of inspector assignment in regulatory outcomes...|$|R
