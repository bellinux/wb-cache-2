500|$|The {{first known}} {{physical}} remain of the broad-billed parrot was a subfossil mandible collected {{along with the}} first batch of dodo bones found in the Mare aux Songes swamp. The English biologist Richard Owen described the mandible in 1866 and identified it as belonging to a large parrot species, to which he gave the binomial name Psittacus mauritianus and the common name [...] "broad-billed parrot". This holotype specimen is now lost. In 1868, shortly after the 1601 journal of the Dutch East India Company ship Gelderland had been rediscovered, the German ornithologist Hermann Schlegel examined an unlabelled pen-and-ink sketch in it.

The subspecies found along the Himalayas is grandis and is the largest and has long glossy neck hackles. The Andaman Islands form otiosus has shorter neck hackles and the crest is highly reduced while the Nicobars Island form nicobariensis has a longer <b>frontal</b> <b>crest</b> and with smaller neck hackles than otiosus.

5000|$|The holotype of Sahitisuchus is well preserved, {{although}} during preservation {{the skull}} became slightly compressed dorsoventrally. This effect is mainly observable on {{some elements of}} the rear portion of the skull, particularly the supraoccipital that is displaced towards the foramen magnum. The {{tip of the snout}} and the premaxillae are broken off. Sahitisuchus possesses the two following autapomorphies among sebecids: the odontoid process is fused to the axis with vertical anterior surface, lacking medial processes, and its mandible lacks an external mandibular fenestra. Sahitisuchus can be also distinguished from other sebecids by a combination of characters. As in Lorosuchus, there is a shallow ventrolateral depression in its infraorbital jugal region. A shallow elliptical depression is present near the cranio-mandibular articulation on the posterior surface of the quadrate, and the dorsal edge of supratemporal fossa is rough and rugose, as seen in Sebecus. The exoccipital posterior processes are sharp, half moon-shaped and directed medially, as in Ayllusuchus. The jugal in Sahitisuchus is very large and ornamented, and as previously observed only in Bretesuchus, its rear ramus is higher than the anterior process and expands laterally. As in Bretesuchus and Sebecus, it has a rough longitudinal ridge on the lateroventral edge of angular bone and dentary, that ends near the mandibular symphysis level. The frontal bone is broad and triangular and ornamented similarly to the maxilla. As in many basal mesoeucrocodylian taxa, which includes some sebecosuchians like Lorosuchus, Sebecus, Zulmasuchus, Iberosuchus and Pepesuchus, a longitudinal <b>frontal</b> <b>crest</b> is present. In Sahitisuchus, it is low and smooth, running from the middle part to the posterior portion the frontal. As in all sebecid species and some other not closely related taxa, the quadratojugal forms a [...] "double articulation" [...] by participating in the cranio-mandibular articulation. As in the peirosaurids Hamadasuchus and Lomasuchus, Sahitisuchus possesses a squamosal prong which is directed backwards and does not form a horn. Such sculptured dorsal posteriorly pointed lobe is also present in Sebecus, but with a more squared-shape rear end. The portion of the tympanic cavity formed by the quadrate is not multi-fenestrated like in protosuchians, notosuchians and baurusuchids, and lacks the characteristic oblong concavity of baurusuchids. In Sahitisuchus it shows only two openings, as seen in Sebecus, Hamadasuchus and recent species. As in Sebecus, the only other sebecid known from this part of the skeleton, the diapophysis is divided by the neurocentral suture and in lateral view, the centrum shows a medial constriction and a trapezoidal shape, with anterior and posterior articulations inclined anteriorly. In comparison to Sebecus, Sahitisuchus has more robust and broader diapophyses, and the length of the third cervical centrum is nearly equal compared to the axis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Basaltic pahoehoe lava-fed deltas are {{important}} coastal constructions of many oceanic islands and continental flood basalt provinces. Whilst littoral processes {{associated with their}} formation have been described, little s known about subaqueous processes and products. This study is primarily focused on field studies of lava-fed deltas from the James Ross Island Volcanic Group (JRIVG), Antarctica, but also on other published studies of lava-fed deltas, and on information from studies of coarse-grained alluvial deltas. Seven coherent lava facies and eight subaqueously deposited clastic facies from the JRIVG are described and interpreted. Clastic fa ies are dominated by cobble-sized angular lithic and fluidal lithic-vitric breccias. The fluidal lithic-vitric breccias are derived from various slope failure processes acting o large-volume ponded lavas in the <b>frontal</b> <b>crest</b> area, or from gravity-driven ductile detachment of the margins of active pillow and sheet lavas on the steep subaqueous slope. Angular lithic breccias are g nerated mostly by similar brittle processes operating on cooled an jointed lavas ponded upslope.

40|$|Considered one of {{the best}} known flying reptiles, Pteranodon has been subject to several reviews in the last century. Found {{exclusively}} in the Upper Cretaceous Niobrara Formation and Pierre Shale Group 11 species have been attributed to this genus (excluding the ones presently regarded as representing Nyctosaurus). While reviewers agree that this number is inflated, there is disagreement on how many species can be identified. The last review recognized only two species (Pteranodon longiceps and Pteranodon sternbergi) both being sexually dimorphic. Based on several cranial features, some specimens previously referred to the genus Pteranodon are re-evaluated leading to the recognition of the following species, two of which new that are described here: Pteranodon longiceps, Geosternbergia sternbergi, Geosternbergia maiseyi sp. nov., and Dawndraco kanzai gen. et sp. nov. They differ mainly by features such as the direction and extension of the <b>frontal</b> <b>crest,</b> the angle and extension of the posterior process of the premaxillae, the shape and extension of the lower temporal fenestra and the length and proportion of the rostrum. The procedures to recognize a pterosaur species are also discussed here, and must take into account primarily morphology, in conjunction with stratigraphic and geographic data. Although well aware that changes in morphology not always reflect taxonomy, the lack of stratigraphic data and the limited number of specimens that can be confidently assigned to one species hampers our understanding on the morphological variations as a function of ontogeny, individual variation and sexual dimorphism. Although the present study has not eliminated the possibility to recognize such differences, caution is needed before models are generalized for pterosaurs...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{abundant}} remains from Sima de los Huesos and Arago, human cranial {{variability in the}} earlier Middle Pleistocene of Europe is poorly known, which {{makes it difficult to}} assess patterns of human diversity and possible regions for ancestral populations associated with the western Eurasian spread of the Acheulian technocomplex. A recently discovered partial cranium from the Gruta da Aroeira may shed some light on this period. U-series dating of stratigraphically overlying flowstone provides a minimum age of 390 ka, placing the fossil in the relevant time period. This cave site was first excavated between 1998 and 2002, revealing a rich collection of Acheulian bifaces in association with large mammals and two human teeth [1 - 2]. Work resumed in 2013, intent on reaching bedrock and establishing the chronology of the stratigraphic sequence, which, {{at the back of the}} cave, spans 4 m and comprises three major stratigraphic units. Unit 1 is a colmatation breccia. Unit 2 is a 2. 2 m-thick mud-supported breccia rich in angular and sub-rounded clasts comprising Acheulean layer X. Basal unit 3 is a fluvial cave deposit comprising two layers: XI, with faunal remains but no artefacts; XII, sterile. The layer X lithics include handaxes and other bifacial tools; the Levallois method was not used. The highly fragmented faunal remains are dominated by cervids and equids and include Rhinocerotidae, bear, a large bovid, a caprid, and tortoise. Burnt bone fragments were recovered at the base of layer X. A partial human cranium encased in rockgrade breccia was discovered at the base of layer X. It consists of a large part of the right side of a braincase, lacking the occipital bone, but also preserving a portion of the left side of the frontal squama and supraorbital torus, as well as the interorbital region, including the vertical part of the nasal bones. A fragment of the right maxilla, with two molars partially preserved, was also found attached to the calvarium but not in anatomical position. Based on the degree of synostosis of the right coronal suture, the individual was a mature adult. There is no plastic deformation of the preserved regions although an extensive area of the outer surface of the frontal squama and the supraorbital torus was mechanically eroded (abraded) before final deposition, indicating a certain amount of transportation. As a consequence of the abrasion, the frontal squama was considerably thinned and the midorbital and lateral (trigone) parts of the supraorbital arches are lost. The fossil was mechanically removed from the breccia with great care and accuracy, and then CT-scanned and virtually reconstructed, using the Mimics v. 18 software program. Although neither the sagittal suture nor bregma are preserved, there remains enough of the right portion of the frontal bone (including the interior <b>frontal</b> <b>crest)</b> to identify the midline. The preserved portions were mirror-imaged and the main transverse neurocranial diameters were measured. The Aroeira skull shows relatively thick bones, and an angular torus is present on the right parietal bone. This latter feature is a primitive trait found on some Middle Pleistocene fossils from the Sima de los Huesos, Caune de l’Arago and Ceprano, but not found in Neandertals and is consistent with a geological age between 400 ka and 500 ka. When the reconstructed braincase is viewed posteriorly, the parietal walls are fairly vertical but converge slightly towards the top. The general measurements of the Aroeira neurocranium are well within the ranges of the Sima de los Huesos (Atapuerca) collection and other European fossils attributed to the mid Middle Pleistocene, although the thickness of the supraorbital torus and the interorbital breadth are outstanding. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|The early Upper Palaeolithic in Haute-Normandie, {{and more}} {{generally}} in northern France, is poorly known. The industries from Saint-Martin-Osmonville and Epouville are particularly interesting {{because the first}} analyses conducted during the 1970 s and 1980 s led to {{the conclusion of a}} possible Châtelperronian for the first site and a mixture of Aurignacian and Mousterian levels for the second one. The stratigraphic position of the industries could be an issue. In Saint-Martin-Osmonville, stratigraphic studies in the 1980 s set the industry in the Nagelbeek level (22000 BP), usually sterile in this area. Recent data have shown the existence of an important hiatus covering the previous period of time, circa 70000 - 30000 BP. At Epouville, the archaeological level is systematically associated with a thin layer of "grumeleux" [gritty] alluvium which does not always rest on the same underlying deposits. More generally, this layer tops the Mesnil-Esnard stratum, which can be changeable, dilated, divided and sometimes non-existent. The industry, included in the immediately posterior alluvium, might be dated back to 45000 - 40000 BP. The "série 3 " from Saint-Martin-Osmonville consists of 1134 knapped flints. Even though the patinas may vary, the assemblage remains technologically homogeneous. There are few laminar products as opposed to the number of points. The use of a softer hammer has been attested on some pieces. The study of operational schemata shows a conceptual continuity with the production of Levallois flakes and laminar production. The knapping method using unipolar sequences dominates the others. The knapping evolves progressively from a facial to a semi-rotating technique. The management of flaking surface convexities can vary greatly. There are few retouched elements, thus it is difficult to propose cultural interpretations. Unlike A. Michel's conclusions, there are no Upper Palaeolithic type tools, there are no unfinished Châtel-perronian points. This assemblage may present some Châtelperronian features including laminar products, a more rotating knapping technique, the use of a softer hammer [...] . But some elements are missing, partly understood operational schemata (the beginning of core exploitation is missing), rare tools and few specific ones [...] . Nevertheless, it seems that the assemblage belongs to the Middle Palaeolithic. In Epouville, the technological analysis has shown the presence of two different archaeological levels, in which two major assemblages can be found. The most important assemblage, also know as "série grise " [grey series], consists of 1034 artefacts. Its main features are a grey patina as well as variable gloss; it has been interpreted as Mousterian. The second one, also called " série vert-marron " [green-brown series], consists of 655 artefacts. Its main features are a brownish-green patina and an important gloss. This assemblage has been extremely disturbed by frost, and has been interpreted as Aurignacian. This second assemblage was the matter under discussion. The "série vert-marron " is characterized by varied production — on the one hand, we have long, regular flakes (first generation striking), and on the other we have shorter, less regular elements (second generation). These two types of production belong to the same evolutional operational schema (a few cores show successive traces of the two sequences). The first laminar knapping is done according to the semi-rotating unipolar method. The operating table is shaped by either lateral crests or a <b>frontal</b> <b>crest.</b> The use of " neo-crested " blades is frequent. The softer hammer is the sole hammer used for this operational schema. As for second generation elements, hard hammer percussion is obvious. Their knapping corresponds to a more opportunistic management of the core. The toolmaker always uses the same method (unipolar), but in a less sophisticated way and with irregular striking. There are few retouched elements, with no sign of the Aurignacian. The " série vert-marron " seems to belong to the early Upper Palaeolithic {{but it is difficult to}} be precise. The lack of technological and typological references for these times in Northern France makes it difficult for us to propose a precise interpretation of this series. La phase ancienne du Paléolithique supérieur en Haute-Normandie, et d'une manière générale dans l'ensemble du Nord de la France, est méconnue. Les industries de Saint-Martin-Osmonville et Epouville sont particulièrement intéressantes à cet égard car les premières analyses dont elles firent l'objet aboutissaient, pour l'une, à un éventuel Châtelperronien et, pour l'autre, à un mélange de couches aurignacienne et moustérienne. La difficulté d'interprétation de ces séries s'exprime par l'absence de calages stratigraphiques fiables et par la faiblesse numérique des enlèvements retouchés. Seule une analyse technologique suffisamment précise pouvait nous permettre d'affiner les hypothèses d'attribution culturelle. Malheureusement, le manque de referents technologiques et typologiques pour le Paléolithique supérieur ancien de la partie septentrionale de la France restreint considérablement le champ de nos investigations.
