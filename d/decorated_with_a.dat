Leonardo responded with a painting of a monster spitting fire that was so terrifying that Ser Piero sold it to a Florentine art dealer, who sold it to the Duke of Milan. Meanwhile, having made a profit, Ser Piero bought a shield <b>decorated</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> heart pierced by an arrow, which he gave to the peasant.|$|E
