5000|$|Screw-in insert nuts have an {{external}} thread and hex head and are screwed {{in with a}} <b>Flat</b> <b>Blade</b> <b>Screwdriver</b> or an Allen wrench. The screw-in insert nuts come in various sizes and take different screw sizes. For example, a [...] "1/4-20" [...] insert nut will take a 1/4-20 inch bolt. The pre-drilled hole must be as deep as {{the length of the}} insert nut plus any portion of the bolt that may be screwed past the end of the nut in the work piece.|$|E
50|$|The I-Line {{series of}} {{distribution}} panelboards is favored by many electricians for its ease {{and safety of}} adding new breakers. The panel uses a stacked bus system that protects the energized bus from accidental contact and the breaker can be easily installed using a <b>flat</b> <b>blade</b> <b>screwdriver</b> contacting only de-energized parts of the backplane of the panel. The design of the breakers and panel require that extra attention be paid to phase rotation, as the right (even-numbered) side of the panel will have the phases in a C-B-A configuration whereas the left (odd-numbered) side of the panel will have a more standard A-B-C arrangement.|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a set of}} experiments concerning the behavior of several types of impellers regarding the depression formatted and operating in a specific range of rotations. Various mixer designs including a four pitched blades impeller, a six <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> impeller and four two <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> impeller were compared. Experimental data confirmed the analytical results previously obtained. The results showed that there are similarities regarding the effects generated by four pitched blades impeller {{and one of the}} two <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> impeller. Also, it is found that two shortblade impeller produces the lowest depression of all tested impeller. The maximum depression produced by all type of impellers do not exceeds 120 mmH 2 O at 400 rpm, which is a small value to realize the vaporization of the fluid and to reach the cavitation. The equipment is not in danger to be destroyed. The numerical results obtained by experiments can be used in various practical applications...|$|R

40|$|The present paper explores {{experimentally}} {{the performance}} of two types of hinged plates which rotate about vertical axis when submitted to uniform current. A flat plate configuration and also a flapped plate (say, S shape) configuration have been investigated.

2500|$|Early axial {{compressors}} offered poor efficiency, so {{poor that}} in the early 1920s a number of papers claimed that a practical jet engine would be impossible to construct. Things changed after A. A. Griffith published a seminal paper in 1926, noting that the reason for the poor performance was that existing compressors used <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> and were essentially [...] "flying stalled". He showed that the use of airfoils instead of the <b>flat</b> <b>blades</b> would increase efficiency to the point where a practical jet engine was a real possibility. He concluded the paper with a basic diagram of such an engine, which included a second turbine that was used to power a propeller.|$|R
