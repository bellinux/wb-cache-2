40|$|Fluidized-bed {{combustion}} {{has been}} recognized as a clean coal combustion technology. However, it has been discovered that the nitrous oxide (N 2 O emission from fluidized-bed coal combustion {{is much higher than}} that from pulverized coal combustion. N 2 O emission from <b>circulating</b> fluidized-bed coal <b>combustion</b> is even higher. Heterogeneous reactions of char {{play an important role in}} N 2 O formation and reduction in <b>circulating</b> fluidized-bed coal <b>combustion</b> but there exist many unknowns. In this work the effects of heterogeneous reactions of char on N 2 O formation and reduction were examined in a bench-scale circulating fluidized bed. The experiments revealed that during <b>circulating</b> fluidized-bed coal <b>combustion,</b> N 2 O formation from oxidization of char-N has the same order as N 2 O formation from NO reduction by char, and neither of them is negligible (inlet O- 2 concentration: 21 %, temperature: 1135 - 1225 K). Absorption of oxygen on the surface of char is not an indispensable condition for N 2 O formation from NO reduction, i. e., NO can also be reduced into N 2 O on the surface of char in absence of O- 2. N 2 O formation from NO reduction in the presence of O- 2 contributes about 70 % and is the main path of N 2 O formation from NO reduction. N 2 O formation from NO reduction in the; absence of O- 2 contributes about 30 %, and the relative importance of these two mechanisms of N 2 O formation does not change significantly with NO concentration. Reduction of N 2 O by char is a first-order reaction with an Arrhenius dependence on temperature. The kinetics of N 2 O reduction by various chars were obtained (974 - 1223 K). Different chars have different effects on N 2 O reduction, suggesting that N 2 O reduction ability of char has a dependence on the property of the char itself. These results may partially account for the diversities in N 2 O emissions during combustion of different coals. On the basis of the results of this work, char-related reaction paths of N 2 O formation and reduction were proposed...|$|R
