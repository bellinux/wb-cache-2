40|$|Arguably, {{the most}} bizarre {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) {{is that of the}} euglenozoan eukaryote <b>Diplonema</b> papillatum. The genome consists of numerous small circular chromosomes none of which appears to encode a complete gene. For instance, the cox 1 coding sequence is spread out over nine different chromosomes in non-overlapping pieces (modules), which are transcribed separately and joined to a contiguous mRNA by trans-splicing. Here, we examine how many genes are encoded by <b>Diplonema</b> mtDNA and whether all are fragmented and their transcripts trans-spliced. Module identification is challenging due to the sequence divergence of <b>Diplonema</b> mitochondrial genes. By employing most sensitive protein profile search algorithms and comparing genomic with cDNA sequence, we recognize a total of 11 typical mitochondrial genes. The 10 protein-coding genes are systematically chopped up into three to 12 modules of 60 – 350 [*]bp length. The corresponding mRNAs are all trans-spliced. Identification of ribosomal RNAs is most difficult. So far, we only detect the 3 ′-module of the large subunit ribosomal RNA (rRNA); it does not trans-splice with other pieces. The small subunit rRNA gene remains elusive. Our results open new intriguing questions about the biochemistry and evolution of mitochondrial trans-splicing in <b>Diplonema...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} shed light on the phylogenetic {{position}} of diplonemids within the phylum Euglenozoa, we have sequenced small subunit rRNA (SSU rRNA) genes from <b>Diplonema</b> (syn.

With both markers, the maximum likelihood method favored a closer grouping of diplonemids with kinetoplastids, while the parsimony and distance sug-gested a closer relationship of diplonemids with euglenoids. In each case, the differences between the best tree and the alternative trees were small. The frequency of codon usage in the partial D. papillatum COI was different from both related groups; however, {{as is the case in}} kinetoplastids but not in Euglena, both the non-canonical UGA codon and the canonical UGG codon were used to en-code tryptophan in <b>Diplonema...</b>|$|E
40|$|Kinetoplastid flagellates are {{characterized}} by uniquely massed mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs), the kinetoplasts. Kinetoplastids of the trypanosomatid group possess two types of mtDNA molecules: maxicircles bearing protein and mitoribosomal genes and minicircles specifying guide RNAs, which mediate uridine insertion/deletion RNA editing. These circles are interlocked with one another to form dense networks. Whether these peculiar mtDNA features are restricted to kinetoplastids or prevail throughout Euglenozoa (euglenids, diplonemids, and kinetoplastids) is unknown. Here, we describe the mitochondrial genome and the mitochondrial ultrastructure of <b>Diplonema</b> papillatum, {{a member of the}} diplonemid flagellates, the sister group of kinetoplastids. Fluorescence and electron microscopy show a single mitochondrion per cell with an ultrastructure atypical for Euglenozoa. In addition, DNA is evenly distributed throughout the organelle rather than compacted. Molecular and electron microscopy studies distinguish numerous 6 - and 7 -kbp-sized mitochondrial chromosomes of monomeric circular topology and relaxed conformation in vivo. Remarkably, the cox 1 gene (and probably other mitochondrial genes) is fragmented, with separate gene pieces encoded on different chromosomes. Generation of the contiguous cox 1 mRNA requires trans-splicing, the precise mechanism of which remains to be determined. Taken together, the mitochondrial gene/genome structure of <b>Diplonema</b> is not only different from that of kinetoplastids but unique among eukaryotes as a whole...|$|E
40|$|The unusual DNA base β-d-glucosyl-hydroxymethyluracil, called “J,” replaces ≈ 0. 5 – 1 % of Thy in DNA of African trypanosomes but has {{not been}} found in other organisms thus far. In Trypanosoma brucei, J is located {{predominantly}} in repetitive DNA, and its presence correlates with the silencing of telomeric genes. Using antibodies specific for J, we have developed sensitive assays to screen for J {{in a range of}} organisms and have found that J is not limited to trypanosomes that undergo antigenic variation but is conserved among Kinetoplastida. In all kinetoplastids tested, including the human pathogens Leishmania donovani and Trypanosoma cruzi, J was found to be abundantly present in the (GGGTTA) n telomere repeats. Outside Kinetoplastida, J was found only in <b>Diplonema,</b> a small phagotrophic marine flagellate, in which we also identified 5 -MeCyt. Fractionation of <b>Diplonema</b> DNA showed that the two modifications are present in a common genome compartment, which suggests that they may have a similar function. Dinoflagellates appear to contain small amounts of modified bases that may be analogs of J. The evolutionary conservation of J in kinetoplastid protozoans suggests that it has a general function, repression of transcription or recombination, or a combination of both.

40|$|Gametogenesis is {{a sexually}} dimorphic process {{requiring}} profound differences in germ cell differentiation between the sexes. In mammals, {{the presence of}} heteromorphic sex chromosomes in males creates additional sex-specific challenges, including incomplete X and Y pairing during meiotic prophase. This triggers formation of a heterochromatin domain, the XY body. The XY body disassembles after prophase, but specialized sex chromatin persists, with further modification, through meiosis. Here, we investigate the function of DMRT 7, a mammal-specific protein related to the invertebrate sexual regulators Doublesex and MAB- 3. We find that DMRT 7 preferentially localizes to the XY body in the pachytene stage of meiotic prophase and is required for male meiosis. In Dmrt 7 mutants, meiotic pairing and recombination appear normal, and a transcriptionally silenced XY body with appropriate chromatin marks is formed, but most germ cells undergo apoptosis during pachynema. A minority of mutant cells can progress to <b>diplonema,</b> {{but many of these}} escaping cells have abnormal sex chromatin lacking histone H 3 K 9 di- and trimethylation and heterochromatin protein 1 b accumulation, modifications that normally occur between pachynema and <b>diplonema.</b> Based on the localization of DMRT 7 to the XY body and the sex chromatin defects observed in Dmrt 7 mutants, we conclude that DMRT 7 plays a role in the sex chromatin transformation that occurs between pachynem...|$|E

By staining permeabilized Euglena cells with anti-J antibodies, we show that J is rather uniformly distributed in the Euglena nucleus, and does not co-localize to a substantial extent with (GGGTTA) n repeats, the putative telomeric repeats of Euglena. Hence, most of J in Euglena appears to be non-telomeric. Our results add to the existing evidence for a close phylogenetic relation between kinetoplastids and euglenids...|$|E
40|$|Homologous {{chromosome}} pairs (bivalents) undergo restructuring during meiotic prophase {{to convert}} a configuration that promotes crossover recombination into one that promotes bipolar spindle attachment and localized cohesion loss. We have imaged remodeling of meiotic chromosome structures after pachytene exit in Caenorhabditis elegans. Chromosome shortening during <b>diplonema</b> {{is accompanied by}} coiling of chromosome axes and highly asymmetric departure of synaptonemal complex (SC) central region proteins SYP- 1 and SYP- 2, which diminish {{over most of the}} length of each desynapsing bivalent while becoming concentrated on axis segments distal to the single emerging chiasma. This and other manifestations of asymmetry along chromosomes are lost in synapsis-proficient crossover-defective mutants, which often retain SYP- 1, 2 along the full lengths of coiled diplotene axes. Moreover, a γ-irradiation treatment that restores crossovers in the spo- 11 mutant also restores asymmetry of SYP- 1 localization. We propose that crossovers or crossover precursors serve as symmetry-breaking events that promote differentiation of subregions of the bivalent by triggering asymmetric disassembly of the SC...|$|E
40|$|Chromosome {{abnormalities}} {{are common}} in the human population, causing germ cell loss at meiotic prophase I and infertility. The mechanisms driving this loss are unknown, but persis-tent meiotic DNA damage and asynapsis may be triggers. Here we investigate the contribu-tion of these lesions to oocyte elimination in mice with chromosome abnormalities, e. g. Turner syndrome (XO) and translocations. We show that asynapsed chromosomes trigger oocyte elimination at <b>diplonema,</b> which {{is linked to the}} presence of phosphorylated H 2 AFX (γH 2 AFX). We find that DNA double-strand break (DSB) foci disappear on asynapsed chro-mosomes during pachynema, excluding persistent DNA damage as a likely cause, and demonstrating the existence in mammalian oocytes of a repair pathway for asynapsis-asso-ciated DNA DSBs. Importantly, deletion or point mutation of H 2 afx restores oocyte numbers in XO females to wild type (XX) levels. Unexpectedly, we find that asynapsed supernumer-ary chromosomes do not elicit prophase I loss, despite being enriched for γH 2 AFX and other checkpoint proteins. These results suggest that oocyte loss cannot be explained sim-ply by asynapsis checkpoint models, but is related to the gene content of asynapsed chro...|$|E
40|$|The {{expression}} of DNA mismatch repair (DMMR) genes {{in patients with}} maturation arrest (MA) was analyzed. Samples were subjected to mutL homolog 3 (MLH 3) mutation analysis by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography/sequencing and quantification of MMR expression in testicular tissue by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Microsatellite instability assays were negative. Two missense and 1 intronic mutations were found. The missense mutation 2531 C/T (P 844 L), predicted to affect MLH 3 function, was found in 3 MA cases {{in association with the}} intronic variant IVS 9 þ 66 G/A. Relative messenger RNA (mRNA) quantification identified 2 patients who overexpressed MLH 3, 1 of them also overexpressing mutL homolog 1 (MLH 1). The latter also presented the 2531 C/T-IVS 9 þ 66 G/A mutation. In conclusion, we suggest that a predominance of MLH 3 expression might favor the MLH 1 /MLH 3 complex which then would compete with the MLH 1 /PMS 2 complexes. This could convey disruption of the relative stoichiometry between MLH 1 /MLH 3 and MLH 1 /PMS 2 complexes, thus causing meiosis failure, as MLH 1 /PMS 2 complexes are supposed to replace MLH 1 /MLH 3 during <b>diplonema...</b>|$|E
40|$|Mitochondrial ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) often display reduced {{size and}} deviant {{secondary}} structure, and sometimes are fragmented, as are their correspond-ing genes. Here we report a mitochondrial large subunit rRNA (mt-LSU rRNA) with unprecedented features. In the protist <b>Diplonema,</b> the rnl gene is {{split into two}} pieces (modules 1 and 2, 534 - and 352 -nt long) that are encoded by distinct mitochon-drial chromosomes, yet the rRNA is continuous. To reconstruct the post-transcriptional maturation pathway of this rRNA, we have catalogued transcript intermediates by deep RNA sequencing and RT-PCR. Gene modules are transcribed separately. Subsequently, transcripts are end-processed, the module- 1 transcript is polyuridylated and the module- 2 transcript is polyadenylated. The two modules are joined via trans-splicing that retains at the junction 26 uridines, resulting in an extent of insertion RNA editing not observed before in any system. The A-tail of trans-spliced molecules is shorter than that of mono-module 2, and completely absent from mitoribosome-associated mt-LSU rRNA. We also characterize putative antisense transcripts. Antisense-mono-modules corroborate bi-directional transcription of chromosomes. Antisense-mt-LSU rRNA, if functional, {{has the potential of}} guiding concomitantly trans-splicing and editing of this rRNA.

40|$|Background: Parabasalia are {{single-celled}} eukaryotes (protists) {{that are}} mainly comprised of endosymbionts of termites and wood roaches, intestinal commensals, human or veterinary parasites, and free-living species. Phylogenetic comparisons of parabasalids are typically based upon morphological characters and 18 S ribosomal RNA gene sequence data (rDNA), while biochemical or molecular studies of parabasalids {{are limited to}} a few axenically cultivable parasites. These previous analyses and other studies based on PCR amplification of duplicated protein-coding genes are unable to fully resolve the evolutionary relationships of parabasalids. As a result, genetic studies of Parabasalia lag behind other organisms. Principal Findings: Comparing parabasalid EF 1 a, a-tubulin, enolase and MDH protein-coding genes with information from the Trichomonas vaginalis genome reveals difficulty in resolving the history of species or isolates apart from duplicated genes. A conserved single-copy gene encodes the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (Rpb 1) in T. vaginalis and other eukaryotes. Here we directly sequenced Rpb 1 degenerate PCR products from 10 parabasalid genera, including several T. vaginalis isolates and avian isolates, and compared these data by phylogenetic analyses. Rpb 1 genes from parabasalids, diplomonads, Parabodo, <b>Diplonema</b> and Percolomonas were all intronless, unlike intron-rich homologs in Naegleria, Jakoba and Malawimonas.

40|$|Chromosome rearrangements are {{important}} drivers in genome and gene evolution, with implications ranging from speciation to development to disease. In the flagellate <b>Diplonema</b> papillatum (Euglenozoa), mitochondrial genome rearrangements {{have resulted in}} nearly hundred chromosomes and a systematic dispersal of gene fragments across the multipartite genome. Maturation into functional RNAs involves separate transcription of gene pieces, joining of precursor RNAs via trans-splicing, and RNA editing by substitution and uridine additions both reconstituting crucial coding sequence. How widespread these unusual features are across diplonemids is unclear. We have analyzed the mitochondrial genomes and transcriptomes of four species from the Diplonema/Rhynchopus clade, revealing a considerable genomic plasticity. Although gene breakpoints, and thus {{the total number of}} gene pieces (~ 80), are essentially conserved across this group, the number of distinct chromosomes varies by a factor of two, with certain chromosomes combining up to eight unrelated gene fragments. Several internal protein-coding gene pieces overlap substantially, resulting, for example, in a stretch of 22 identical amino acids in cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5. Finally, the variation of post-transcriptional editing patterns across diplonemids indicates compensation of two adverse trends: rapid sequence evolution and loss of genetic information through unequal chromosome segregation...|$|E
40|$|Kinetoplastids are a {{large group}} of {{free-living}} and parasitic eukaryotic flagellates, including the medically important trypanosomatids (e. g., Trypanosoma and Leishmania) and the widespread free-living and parasitic bodonids. Small subunit rRNA- and conserved protein-based phylogenies support the division of kinetoplastids into five orders (Prokinetoplastida, Neobodonida, Parabodonida, Eubodonida, and Trypanosomatida), but they produce incongruent results regarding their relative branching order, in particular for the position of the Trypanosomatida. In general, small subunit rRNA tends to support their early emergence, whereas protein phylogenies most often support a more recent origin from within bodonids. In order to resolve this question through a phylogenomic approach, we carried out massive parallel sequencing of cDNA from representatives of three bodonid orders (Bodo saltans-Eubodonida-, Procryptobia sorokini-Parabodonida-, and Rhynchomonas nasuta-Neobodonida-). We identified 64 well-conserved proteins shared by these species, four trypanosomatids, and two closely related outgroup species (Euglena gracilis and <b>Diplonema</b> papillatum). Phylogenetic analysis of a concatenated data set yielded a strongly supported tree showing the late emergence of trypanosomatids as a sister group of the Eubodonida. In addition, we identified homologues of proteins involved in trypanosomatid mitochondrial mRNA editing in the three bodonid species, suggesting that editing may be widespread in kinetoplastids.

40|$|Most rust fungi have {{a complex}} life cycle {{involving}} {{up to five}} different spore-producing stages. The telial stage that produces melanised overwintering teliospores {{is one of these}} and plays a fundamental role for generating genetic diversity as karyogamy and meiosis occur at that stage. Despite the importance of telia for the rust life cycle, almost nothing is known about the fungal genetic programs that are activated in this overwintering structure. In the present study, the transcriptome of telia produced by the poplar rust fungus M. larici-populina has been investigated using whole genome exon oligoarrays and RT-qPCR. Comparative expression profiling at the telial and uredinial stages identifies genes specifically expressed or up-regulated in telia including osmotins/thaumatin-like proteins and aquaporins that may reflect specific adaptation to overwintering as well numerous lytic enzymes acting on plant cell wall, reflecting extensive cell wall remodelling at that stage. The temporal dynamics of karyogamy was followed using combined RT-qPCR and DAPI-staining approaches. This reveals that fusion of nuclei and induction of karyogamy-related genes occur simultaneously between the 25 - 39 days post inoculation time frame. Transcript profiling of conserved meiosis genes indicate a preferential induction right after karyogamy and corroborate that meiosis begins prior to overwintering and is interrupted in Meiosis I (prophase I, <b>diplonema</b> stage) until teliospore germination in early spring...|$|E
40|$|Meiosis is {{a highly}} conserved process, which is stringently {{regulated}} in all organisms, from fungi through to humans. Two major events define meiosis in eukaryotes. The first is the pairing, or synapsis, of homologous chromosomes {{and the second is}} the exchange of genetic information in a process called meiotic recombination. Synapsis is mediated by the meiosis-specific synaptonemal complex structure in combination with the cohesins that tether sister chromatids together along chromosome arms through prophase I. Previously, we identified FKBP 6 as a novel component of the mammalian synaptonemal complex. Further studies demonstrated an interaction between FKBP 6 and the NIMA-related kinase- 1, NEK 1. To further investigate the role of NEK 1 in mammalian meiosis, we have examined gametogenesis in the spontaneous mutant, Nek 1 kat 2 J. Homozygous mutant animals show decreased testis size, defects in testis morphology, and in cohesin removal at late prophase I of meiosis, causing complete male infertility. Cohesin protein SMC 3 remains localized to the meiotic chromosome cores at <b>diplonema</b> in the Nek 1 mutant, and also in the related Fkbp 6 mutant, while in wild type cells SMC 3 is removed from the cores at the end of prophase I and becomes more diffuse throughout the DAPI stained region of the nucleus.

Here {{we report on the}} characterization of an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced, recessive allele called mei 4, which causes sterility in both sexes owing to meiotic defects. In mutant spermatocytes, chromosomes fail to congress properly at the metaphase plate, leading to arrest and apoptosis before the first meiotic division. Mutant oocytes have a similar chromosomal phenotype but in vitro can undergo meiotic divisions and fertilization before arresting. During late meiotic prophase in mei 4 mutant males, absence of cyclin dependent kinase 2 and mismatch repair protein association from chromosome cores is correlated with the premature separation of bivalents at <b>diplonema</b> owing to lack of chiasmata. We have identified the causative mutation, a transversion in the 5 ' splice donor site of exon 1 in the mouse ortholog of Human Enhancer of Invasion 10 (Hei 10; also known as Gm 288 in mouse and CCNB 1 IP 1 in human), a putative B-type cyclin E 3 ubiquitin ligase. Importantly, orthologs of Hei 10 are found exclusively in deuterostomes and not in more ancestral protostomes such as yeast, worms, or flies.

Sycp 1 (-/-) spermatocytes form normal AEs, which align homologously, but do not synapse.

40|$|The {{intimate}} synapsis of {{homologous chromosome}} pairs (homologs) by synaptonemal complexes (SCs) {{is an essential}} feature of meiosis. In many organisms, synapsis and homologous recombination are interdependent: recombination promotes SC formation and SCs are required for crossing-over. Moreover, several studies indicate that initiation of SC assembly occurs at sites where crossovers will subsequently form. However, recent analyses in budding yeast and fruit fly imply a special role for centromeres in the initiation of SC formation. In addition, in budding yeast, persistent SC–dependent centromere-association facilitates the disjunction of chromosomes that have failed to become connected by crossovers. Here, we examine the interplay between SCs, recombination, and centromeres in a mammal. In mouse spermatocytes, centromeres do not serve as SC initiation sites and are invariably the last regions to synapse. However, centromeres are refractory to de-synapsis during <b>diplonema</b> and remain associated by short SC fragments. Since SC–dependent centromere association is lost before diakinesis, a direct role in homolog segregation seems unlikely. However, post–SC disassembly, we find evidence of inter-centromeric connections that could play a more direct role in promoting homolog biorientation and disjunction. A second class of persistent SC fragments is shown to be crossover-dependent. Super-resolution structured-illumination microscopy (SIM) reveals that these structures initially connect separate homolog axes and progressively diminish as chiasmata form. Thus, DNA crossing-over (which occurs during pachynema) and axis remodeling appear to b...|$|E

Although previous studies showed that cyanobacterial gnd genes, which encode 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, are present in several plastid-lacking protists as well as primary and secondary plastid-containing phototrophic eukaryotes, the evolutionary paths of these genes remain elusive. Results Here we show an extended phylogenetic analysis including novel gnd gene sequences from Excavata and Glaucophyta. Our analysis demonstrated the patchy distribution of the excavate genes in the gnd gene phylogeny. The <b>Diplonema</b> gene was related to cytosol-type genes in red algae and Opisthokonta, while heterolobosean genes occupied basal phylogenetic positions with plastid-type red algal genes within the monophyletic eukaryotic group that is sister to cyanobacterial genes. Statistical tests based on exhaustive maximum likelihood analyses strongly rejected that heterolobosean gnd genes were derived from a secondary plastid of green lineage. In addition, the cyanobacterial gnd genes from phototrophic and phagotrophic species in Euglenida were robustly monophyletic with Stramenopiles, and this monophyletic clade was moderately separated from those of red algae. These data suggest that these secondary phototrophic groups might have acquired the cyanobacterial genes independently of secondary endosymbioses.

These data suggest that these secondary phototrophic groups might have acquired the cyanobacterial genes independently of secondary endosymbioses. ConclusionWe propose an evolutionary scenario in which plastid-lacking Excavata acquired cyanobacterial gnd genes via eukaryote-to-eukaryote lateral gene transfer or primary endosymbiotic gene transfer early in eukaryotic evolution, and then lost either their pre-existing or cyanobacterial gene...|$|E
40|$|Bloom’s {{syndrome}} (BS) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal recessive}} disorder of humans characterized by severe pre- and postnatal growth deficiency, immunodeficiency, genomic instability, and a predisposition {{to a wide variety}} of neoplasms. The genomic instability is evidenced in BS somatic cells as a high incidence of gaps and breaks, chromatid exchanges, chromosome rearrangements, and locus-specific mutations. BS arises from a mutation in BLM, a gene encoding a protein with homology to the RecQ helicase family. Men with BS are sterile; women have reduced fertility and a shortened reproductive span. The current immunocytological study on mouse spermatocytes shows that the BLM protein is first evident as discrete foci along the synaptonemal complexes (SCs) of homologously synapsed autosomal bivalents in late zygonema of meiotic prophase. BLM foci progressively dissociate from the synapsed autosomal axes during early pachynema and are no longer seen in mid-pachynema. BLM colocalizes with the single-stranded DNA binding replication protein A, which has been shown to be involved in meiotic synapsis. However, there is a temporal delay in the appearance of BLM protein along the SCs relative to replication protein A, suggesting that BLM is required for a late step in processing of a subset of genomic DNA involved in establishment of interhomologue interactions in early meiotic prophase. In late pachynema and into <b>diplonema,</b> BLM is more dispersed in the nucleoplasm, especially over the chromatin most intimately associated with the SCs, suggesting a possible involvement of BLM in resolution of interlocks in preparation for homologous chromosome disjunction during anaphase I...|$|E
40|$|Frequent {{subgraph}} mining is {{a useful}} method for extracting biologically relevant patterns from a set of graphs or a single large graph. Here, the graph represents all possible RNA structures and interactions. Patterns that are significantly more frequent in this graph over a random graph are extracted. We hypothesize that these patterns {{are most likely to}} represent a biological mechanisms. The graph representation used is a directed dual graph, extended to handle intermolecular interactions. The graph is sampled for sub-graphs, which are labeled using a canonical labeling method and counted. The resulting patterns are compared to those created from a randomized dataset and scored. The algo-rithm was applied to the mitochondrial genome of the kinetoplastid species Trypanosoma brucei. This species has a unique RNA editing mechanism that has been well studied, making it a good model organism to test RiboFSM. The most significant patterns con-tain two stem-loops, indicative of gRNA, and represent interactions of these structures with target mRNA. ii Acknowledgements The foremost person I would like to thank is my supervisor Marcel Turcotte.

40|$|We {{have shown}} earlier that DNA {{polymerase}} beta (Pol beta) localizes to the synaptonemal complex (SC) during Prophase I of meiosis in mice. Pol beta localizes to synapsed axes during zygonema and pachynema, and it associates with {{the ends of}} bivalents during late pachynema and <b>diplonema.</b> To test whether these localization patterns reflect a function for Pol beta in recombination and/or synapsis, we used conditional gene targeting to delete the PolB gene from germ cells. We find that Pol beta-deficient spermatocytes are defective in meiotic chromosome synapsis and undergo apoptosis during Prophase I. We also find that SPO 11 -dependent gammaH 2 AX persists on meiotic chromatin, indicating that Pol beta is critical for the repair of SPO 11 -induced double-strand breaks (DSBs). Pol beta-deficient spermatocytes yielded reduced steady-state levels of the SPO 11 -oligonucleotide complexes that are formed when SPO 11 {{is removed from the}} ends of DSBs, and cytological experiments revealed that chromosome-associated foci of replication protein A (RPA), RAD 51 and DMC 1 are less abundant in Pol beta-deficient spermatocyte nuclei. Localization of Pol beta to meiotic chromosomes requires the formation of SPO 11 -dependent DSBs. Taken together, these findings strongly indicate that Pol beta is required at a very early step in the processing of meiotic DSBs, at or before the removal of SPO 11 from DSB ends and the generation of the 3 ' single-stranded tails necessary for subsequent strand exchange. The chromosome synapsis defects and Prophase I apoptosis of Pol beta-deficient spermatocytes are likely a direct consequence of these recombination defect...|$|E
40|$|Parabasalia are {{single-celled}} eukaryotes (protists) {{that are}} mainly comprised of endosymbionts of termites and wood roaches, intestinal commensals, human or veterinary parasites, and free-living species. Phylogenetic comparisons of parabasalids are typically based upon morphological characters and 18 S ribosomal RNA gene sequence data (rDNA), while biochemical or molecular studies of parabasalids {{are limited to}} a few axenically cultivable parasites. These previous analyses and other studies based on PCR amplification of duplicated protein-coding genes are unable to fully resolve the evolutionary relationships of parabasalids. As a result, genetic studies of Parabasalia lag behind other organisms. Comparing parabasalid EF 1 α, α-tubulin, enolase and MDH protein-coding genes with information from the Trichomonas vaginalis genome reveals difficulty in resolving the history of species or isolates apart from duplicated genes. A conserved single-copy gene encodes the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (Rpb 1) in T. vaginalis and other eukaryotes. Here we directly sequenced Rpb 1 degenerate PCR products from 10 parabasalid genera, including several T. vaginalis isolates and avian isolates, and compared these data by phylogenetic analyses. Rpb 1 genes from parabasalids, diplomonads, Parabodo, <b>Diplonema</b> and Percolomonas were all intronless, unlike intron-rich homologs in Naegleria, Jakoba and Malawimonas. The phylogeny of Rpb 1 from parasitic and free-living parabasalids, and conserved Rpb 1 insertions, support Trichomonadea, Tritrichomonadea, and Hypotrichomonadea as monophyletic groups. These {{results are consistent with}} prior analyses of rDNA and GAPDH sequences and ultrastructural data. The Rpb 1 phylogenetic tree also resolves species- and isolate-level relationships. These findings, together with the relative ease of Rpb 1 isolation, make it an attractive tool for evaluating more extensive relationships within Parabasalia...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondrial cytochromes c and c 1 {{are present}} in all eukaryotes that use oxygen as the {{terminal}} electron acceptor in the respiratory chain. Maturation of c-type cytochromes requires covalent attachment of the heme cofactor to the protein, and {{there are at least}} five distinct biogenesis systems that catalyze this post-translational modification in different organisms and organelles. In this study, we use biochemical data, comparative genomic and structural bioinformatics investigations to provide a holistic view of mitochondrial c-type cytochrome biogenesis and its evolution. There are three pathways for mitochondrial c-type cytochrome maturation, only one of which is present in prokaryotes. We analyze the evolutionary distribution of these biogenesis systems, which include the Ccm system (System I) and the enzyme heme lyase (System III). We conclude that heme lyase evolved once and, in many lineages, replaced the multicomponent Ccm system (present in the proto-mitochondrial endosymbiont), probably as a consequence of lateral gene transfer. We find no evidence of a System III precursor in prokaryotes, and argue that System III is incompatible with multi-heme cytochromes common to bacteria, but absent from eukaryotes. The evolution of the eukaryotic-specific protein heme lyase is strikingly unusual, given that this protein provides a function (thioether bond formation) that is also ubiquitous in prokaryotes. The absence of any known c-type cytochrome biogenesis system from the sequenced genomes of various trypanosome species indicates the presence of a third distinct mitochondrial pathway. Interestingly, this system attaches heme to mitochondrial cytochromes c that contain only one cysteine residue, rather than the usual two, within the heme-binding motif. The isolation of single-cysteine-containing mitochondrial cytochromes c from free-living kinetoplastids, Euglena and the marine flagellate <b>Diplonema</b> papillatum suggests that this unique form of heme attachment is restricted to, but conserved throughout, the protist phylum Euglenozo...|$|E
40|$|To {{shed light}} on the disputed {{molecular}} phylogeny of Euglenozoa, SSU rDNA sequences of an uncultured Peranema sp. (wild) and cultured Ploeotia edaphica (CCAP 1265 / 2) were isolated and a database was created containing a great many euglenozoan SSU rDNA sequences. Additionally, new LSU rDNA sequences were isolated from diplonemid Rhynchopus euleeides (ATCC 50226) and <b>Diplonema</b> ambulator (ATCC 50223) as well as of phagotrophic euglenids Entosiphon sulcatum (CCAP 1220 / 1 B), Notosolenus ostium (wild), Peranema trichophorum (CCAP 1260 / 1 B), Petalomonas cantuscygni (CCAP 1259 / 1), Ploeotia costata (CCAP 1265 / 1), and primary osmotrophic euglenids Astasia curvata (SAG 1204 - 5 b), Astasia torta (SAG 217. 80) and Rhabdomonas costata (SAG 1271 - 1) by the application of specifically designed primers for primer walking through unknown parts of this understudied gene region. As a new approach, recently published SSU and LSU rRNA secondary structure data of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Petrov et al. 2013 and 2014) was utilized as a blueprint for alignment of nucleotide sequences and deduction of secondary structure elements. Several datasets were formed to investigate phylogenetic inferences of SSU rDNA sequences with an equilibrated taxon sampling, separate marine and freshwater lineages and a combined set comprising more than 150 euglenozoan SSU rDNA sequences. Further examinations included two datasets derived from new LSU rDNA sequences as well as a concatenated dataset comprising genetic information of the ribosomal operon for the first time concerning euglenids, diplonemids and kinetoplastids. To address the adherent problem of weakness in statistical support regarding Euglenida found in prior studies, built datasets were additionally examined by phylogenetic network and spectral analyses. These analyses were also used to verify phylogenetic signals of identified monophyla and to test their tree compatibility. Finally, deduced secondary structures were utilized to pinpoint boundaries of coding and spacer regions as a precondition for examination of variable regions of SSU rDNA, SSU and LSU rDNA sequence lengths and corresponding base composition, identity matrices, ITS sequences and their insertion sites in LSU rDNA as well as unique nucleotide substitutions in the search for group specificities among Euglenozoa. As a result, important findings concerning the phylogeny of major euglenozoan groups have been found, i. e. (1) Euglenida were not monophyletic, for Petalomonadida represented the deepest branch of Euglenozoa and the taxon Euglenida possessed no phylogenetic signal (2) Diplonemida were not the sister group of Kinetoplastida, phylogenetic and secondary structure analyses strongly inferred a relation of Diplonemida with Petalomonadida and Ploeotiida rather than with Kinetoplastida, (3) the existence of a euglenid crown group was confirmed by phylogenetic as well as spectral analyses and according to the eponymous autapomorphy, a helically pellicle pattern, prior taxon denominations were converted into Helicales taxon nov. PAERSCHKE & PREISFELD 2015, (4) the denominations „phagotrophic euglenids‟ and „Heteronematina‟ sensu Adl et al. (2012) describe a polyphyletic assemblage of euglenids and should be discarded. The present work provides a basis for further examinations of euglenozoan LSU rDNA sequences and thus represents a precursor for future studies concerning the ribosomal operon of Euglenozoa...|$|E
40|$|There {{are more}} than 1029 {{bacteria}} on our planet which represent the most abundant living form and that act as key players within biogeochemical cycles and in the ecosystem functioning. The photo-/autotrophic prokaryotes {{are one of the}} major primary producers in the oceans fueling pelagic food webs especially in oligotrophic conditions, while the heterotrophic fraction represents the principal consumers of the dissolved organic matter (that represent 14 to 20 times the amount of terrestrial organic carbon) contributing to the remineralization of nutrients. Inside the microbial loop, biomass of prokaryotes is continuously recycled via viral lysis while grazing of heterotrophic nanoflagellates and small ciliates channel it towards upper trophic levels. The relevance of prokaryotic biomass as principal source of carbon supporting pelagic food webs in the Mediterranean Sea have been demonstrated among different trophic conditions. The ingestion of prokaryotes by grazers was assessed according with the dilution technique that allows to determine whenever prey communities are efficiently controlled by predators. Bacterivory resulted to be the major pathway for carbon flux in oligo-, meso- and eutrophic conditions although even in eutrophicated situations, when herbivory prevailed, the carbon flux generated by ingestion on prokaryotes was still relevant. Also at the meso- bathypelagic layers the prokaryotes’ consumption still represented an efficient pathway for carbon transfer. Prokaryote communities have been demonstrated to change in abundance and composition over time due to modification of environmental conditions (such as temperature, salinity, resource availability) - bottom-up control - and to mortality mediated by viruses and/or grazers. Predation activity – top-down control – was often identified as the main cause of prokaryotic loss. Some experimental evidences support that feeding process tends to be more selective in regard to more active cells although selection might depend on the composition of grazers’ community. Bacterivores are mainly protists and different taxa display different feeding strategies (e. g. ﬁlter-feeding, sedimentation, interception feeding, raptorial, hosmotroph). Several protist communities have been analyzed from water samples taken during the XXIX Italian expedition in Antarctica - Ross Sea; the analysis of their biodiversity was based on molecular approach though Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technique and samples were sequenced with Ion Torrent PGM platform. The results highlighted as protist communities were shaped accordingly with the history of the water masses: young-newly formed high salinity shelf waters (HSSW) presented protist communities characterized by high relative abundance of autotrophic organisms - which typically bloom at the surface - down at several hundred meters of depths. On the contrary, older circumpolar deep waters (CDW) shown higher abundance of taxa as Radiolaria, Discoba and <b>Diplonema</b> (the latter two belong to the Supergroup of Excavata, typically bacterivore). The same NGS approach was adopted in the experimental design to test the consequences of Aurelia aurita ephyrae appearance in a pelagic community of the Gulf of Trieste.
