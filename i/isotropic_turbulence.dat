40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the consistency of}} the exact scaling laws for <b>isotropic</b> MHD <b>turbulence</b> in numerical simulations with large magnetic Prandtl numbers Pm and with Pm= 1. The exact laws are used to elucidate the structure of the magnetic and velocity fields. Despite the linear scaling of certain third-order correlation functions, the situation is not analogous to the case of Kolmogorov turbulence. The magnetic field is adequately described by a model of stripy (folded) field with direction reversals at the resistive scale. At currently available resolutions, the cascade of kinetic energy is short-circuited by the direct exchange of energy between the forcing-scale motions and the stripy magnetic fields. This nonlocal interaction is the defining feature of <b>isotropic</b> MHD <b>turbulence.</b> Comment: 10 pages, 6 figures. Accepted for publication in Journal of Fluid Mechanic...|$|R
40|$|In <b>isotropic</b> helical <b>turbulence,</b> a new single helical {{model is}} {{suggested}} for large eddy simulation. Based on the Kolmogrov's hypotheses, the helical model is proposed {{according to the}} balance of helicity dissipation and the average of helicity flux across the inertial range, and the helical model {{is a kind of}} eddy viscosity model. The coefficient of the helical model is constant and can be also determined dynamically. Numerical simulations of forced and decaying <b>isotropic</b> helical <b>turbulence</b> demonstrate that the helical model predicts the energy and helicity evolution well. The statistical character of the helical model is closer to the DNS results. In a priori test, the energy and helicity dissipations of the helical model also show a good results. In general, the helical model has the advantage contrast with the dynamic Smogorinsky and mixed models. Comment: 7 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
50|$|The Spalart-Allmaras {{model was}} {{developed}} for aerodynamic flows.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that a {{mechanism}} of energy redistribution and dissipation by the inertial waves can be effectively utilized in <b>isotropic</b> <b>turbulence</b> at small Reynolds numbers (when the nonlocal interactions are the dominating ones). This mechanism totally suppresses the local interactions (cascades) in <b>isotropic</b> <b>turbulence</b> at the Taylor-scale based Reynolds number R_λ < 10 ^ 2. This value of R_λ (that {{can be considered as}} a bifurcation value at which the local regime emerges from the nonlocal one in <b>isotropic</b> <b>turbulence)</b> is in agreement with recent direct numerical simulations data. Applicability of this approach to channel flows is also briefly discussed. A theory of multimode bifurcations has been developed in order to explain anomalous (in comparison with the Landau-Hopf bifurcations) properties of the nonlocal-local bifurcation in <b>isotropic</b> <b>turbulence...</b>|$|E

We find that the survival probabilities of turbulence are exponential and the typical lifetimes increase superexponentially with the Reynolds number. Our results suggest that both <b>isotropic</b> <b>turbulence</b> and wall-bounded shear flows qualitatively share the same phase-space dynamics.

The mean, variance, skewness and flatness of radiation intensity were obtained for conditions observed downstream of the flame tip of a piloted turbulent jet flame, where the statistics of the flow field are close to the ones found in <b>isotropic</b> <b>turbulence.</b> The joint probability density function between the temperature and the radiation intensity is presented, as well as the spectra for the radiation intensity.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between a columnar vortex and exter-llal turbulence is investigated numerically. As the colum-nar vortex) the Lamb-Oseen vortex is used. The columnar vortex is immersed in an initially <b>isotropic</b> homogeneous <b>turbulence</b> field, which itself {{is produced by}} a direct nu-merical simulation of decaying turbulence. Using visu-alization techniques, we investigate the formation of in-homogeneous fine turbulent eddies around the columnar vortex, the vortex-core deformations and the dynamical evolution in the passive scalar field. We investigate the dynamical evolution of the vor-tex structure and the passive scalar structure, appeared due to the <b>isotropic</b> homogeneous <b>turbulence</b> interact-ing with the columnar vortex. The characteristics of the flow field are analyzed by using several flow-visualization techniques. The statistics of the turbulence around the columnar vortex are investigated by computing the two-point energy spectrum tensors, and they are com-pared {{with the results of}} a linear rapid distortion theory (RDT) [11. The growth of the velocity and vorticity dis-turbances are proportional to to. 9 and t 1 respectively. Al-though the results are qualitatively consistent with RDT, that do not agree quantitatively with the prediction of RDT(cx t 2). We solve the Navier-Stokes equation for incompressible fluids and the transport equation for the passive scalar (such as a passive temperature field or a dye) under pe-riodic boundary conditions with period 41 r. A spectral method is. used to solve the equations. The time integra-tion is performed using the fourth order Runge-Kutta-Gill method. The simulations are done with resolutions of 2563 and 5123.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{overview}} of a numerical study on the small-scale dynamics and the large-scale dispersion of small inertial particles in stably stratified turbulence. Three types of particles are examined: fluid particles, light inertial particles (with particle-to-fluid density ratio 1 =¿p/¿f = 25) and heavy inertial particles (¿p/¿ 2 ̆ 6 gt; 2 ̆ 6 gt;f 1). Stratification suppresses the vertical dispersion of all three types of particles compared to <b>isotropic</b> <b>turbulence.</b> The horizontal dispersion, on the other hand, is enhanced. The importance of the hydrodynamic forces, which act on (light) inertial particles and directly affect the small-scale dynamics of the particles, is examined for particles with ¿p/¿f {{in the range from}} 1 to 25. These results primarily concern the forces on light particles in homogeneous <b>isotropic</b> <b>turbulence,</b> as at small scales in weakly stratified turbulence isotropy is almost restored. The effect of the presence of a density stratification on the particle dynamics is thus assumed to be almost negligible, which is supported by the similarity of the results from computations of the forces on small inertial particles in homogeneous <b>isotropic</b> <b>turbulence</b> and in weakly stratified turbulence. The inertia of the particles results in a non-uniform particle distribution over the domain. This preferential concentration effect is briefly reviewed here for heavy particles, and it is found that the effect is stronger in <b>isotropic</b> <b>turbulence</b> than in stratified turbulence. It is shown that preferential concentration also occurs for light inertial particles in homogeneous <b>isotropic</b> <b>turbulence...</b>|$|E
