5|$|The Ju 87 V1, {{powered by}} a Rolls-Royce Kestrel V12 {{cylinder}} liquid-cooled engine, and with a twin tail, crashed on 24 January 1936 at Kleutsch near Dresden, killing Junkers' chief test pilot, Willy Neuenhofen, and his engineer, Heinrich Kreft. The square twin fins and rudders proved too weak; they collapsed and the aircraft crashed after it entered an <b>inverted</b> <b>spin</b> during the testing of the terminal dynamic pressure in a dive. The crash prompted a change to a single vertical stabiliser tail design. To withstand strong forces during a dive, heavy plating was fitted, along with brackets riveted to the frame and longeron, to the fuselage. Other early additions included the installation of hydraulic dive brakes that were fitted under the leading edge and could rotate 90°.|$|E
5|$|Rear Admiral John P. Whitney {{requested}} Shepard's {{services as}} an aide de camp, but Shepard wanted to fly. Therefore, at Shepard's request, Ramage spoke to the admiral on his behalf, and Shepard was instead sent back to Patuxent. He flight tested the McDonnell F3H Demon, Vought F-8 Crusader, Douglas F4D Skyray and Grumman F-11 Tiger. The Vought F7U Cutlass {{had a tendency to}} go into an <b>inverted</b> <b>spin</b> during a snap roll. This was not unusual; many aircraft did this, but normally if the pilot let go of the stick the aircraft would correct itself. When he attempted this in the F7U, Shepard found this was not the case. He was unable {{to break out of the}} spin and was forced to eject. In 1957, he was project test pilot on the Douglas F5D Skylancer. Shepard did not like the plane, and gave it an unfavorable report. The Navy cancelled orders for it, buying the F8U instead. He also filed an unfavorable report on the F11F after a harrowing incident in which the engine failed on him during a high-speed dive. Fortunately, he managed to restart the engine.|$|E

500|$|McCain's plane {{went into}} a {{vertical}} <b>inverted</b> <b>spin.</b> McCain bailed out upside down at high speed; {{the force of the}} ejection fractured his right arm in three places, his left arm, and his right leg at the knee, and knocked him unconscious. McCain nearly drowned after parachuting into Trúc Bạch Lake in Hanoi; the weight of his equipment was pulling him down, and as he regained consciousness, he could not use his arms. Eventually, he was able to inflate his life vest using his teeth. Several Vietnamese, possibly led by Department of Industry clerk Mai Van On, pulled him ashore. [...] A mob gathered around, spat on him, kicked him, and stripped him of his clothes; his left shoulder was crushed with the butt of a rifle and he was bayoneted in his left foot and abdominal area.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been conducted}} in the Langley 20 -foot free-spinning tunnel on a 1 / 30 - scale model of the Grumman XFlOF- 1 airplane to determine its spin and recovery characteristics. The investigation included erect and <b>inverted</b> <b>spins</b> for both the straight-wing and swept-wing configurations. Tests to determine the optimum size spin-recovery parachutes and the rudder forces required for recovery were also made. The results indicated that in the straight-wing configuration, satisfactory recoveries of the airplane will be obtained from erect and <b>inverted</b> <b>spins</b> by rudder reversal alone. In the swept-wing configuration recoveries will be unsatisfactory from erect spins. Unsweeping the wings during the spin and reversal of the rudder, however, will lead to eventual recovery. The test results also indicated that, if existing small ailerons are made deflectable through large angles, satisfactory recoveries will be obtained from erect spins in the swept-wing configuration by simultaneous movement of the rudder to against the spin and movement of the ailerons to with the spin. Normal-size ailerons deflected through a normal range would also be effective. Satisfactory recoveries by rudder reversal will be obtained from <b>inverted</b> <b>spins</b> in the swept-wing configuration. In the straight-wing configuration a 14. 2 -foot tail parachute or a 5. 0 -foot wing-tip parachute opened on the outer wing tip will effect satisfactory recovery of the airplane by parachute action alone; a 30. 0 -foot tail parachute or a 10. 0 -foot wing-tip parachute will be required for the swept-wing configuration. The forces required to fully reverse the rudder should be within {{the capabilities of the}} pilot...|$|R
50|$|Inverted Flat spinThe same as {{the above}} but <b>inverted.</b> <b>Inverted</b> flat <b>spins</b> are easier to control, but {{can be hard to}} come out of due to orientation, and knowing when to stop the spin. When {{entering}} an <b>inverted</b> flat <b>spin,</b> you must apply opposite aileron to which the rudder is going. Once the spin is initiated, you do the same as a standard Flat Spin.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of a 0. 034 -scale model of the production version of the Chance Vought F 7 U- 3 airplane has been conducted in the Langley 20 -foot free-spinning tunnel. The <b>inverted</b> and erect <b>spin</b> and recovery characteristics of the model were determined for the combat loading with the model in the clean condition {{and the effect of}} extending slats was investigated. A brief {{investigation of}} pilot ejection was also performed. The results indicate that the inverted spin-recovery characteristics of the airplane will be satisfactory by full rudder reversal. If the rudders can only be neutralized because of high pedal forces in the <b>inverted</b> <b>spins,</b> satisfactory recovery will be obtained if the auxiliary rudders can be moved to neutral or against the spin provided the stick is held full forward. Optimum control technique for satisfactory recovery from erect spins will be full rudder reversal in conjunction with aileron movement to full with the spin (stick right in a right spin). Extension of the slats will have a slightly adverse effect on recoveries from (1 <b>inverted</b> <b>spins</b> but will have a favorable effect on recoveries from erect spins. The results of brief tests indicate that if a pilot is ejected during a spin while a spin-recovery parachute is extended and fully inflated, he will probably clear the tail parachute...|$|R
50|$|Inverted {{spinning}} and erect or upright spinning are dynamically very similar and require {{essentially the same}} recovery process but use opposite elevator control. In an upright spin, both roll and yaw {{are in the same}} direction but that an <b>inverted</b> <b>spin</b> is composed of opposing roll and yaw. It is crucial that the yaw be countered to effect recovery. The visual field in a typical spin (as opposed to a flat spin) is heavily dominated by the perception of roll over yaw, which can lead to an incorrect and dangerous conclusion that a given <b>inverted</b> <b>spin</b> is actually an erect spin in the reverse yaw direction (leading to a recovery attempt in which pro-spin rudder is mistakenly applied and then further exacerbated by holding the incorrect elevator input).|$|E
50|$|Finally, on 1 May 1950, during {{low-speed}} sideslip and stall tests, {{the first}} prototype, TG283, {{was lost in}} a crash at Hartley Wintney killing the pilot, Sqn Ldr George E.C.

5000|$|First flown on 5 December 1982 and {{certified}} on 2 August 1983, the T67M was {{developed from the}} T67A as a glass-reinforced plastic aircraft for a role as a military trainer. The T67M has a [...] fuel-injected Lycoming AEIO320-D1B and a two-blade Hoffman HO-V72L-V/180CB constant-speed propellor, single piece canopy, fuel in firewall tank. The fuel-injected engine with inverted fuel and oil systems allowed the aircraft to perform sustained negative-G (inverted) aerobatics, although <b>inverted</b> <b>spins</b> were never formally approved. A total of 32 T67Ms (including the later T67M MkII) were produced.|$|R
5000|$|Although entry {{techniques}} are similar, modern military fighter aircraft often tend to require yet another variation on spin recovery techniques. While power is still typically reduced to idle thrust and pitch control neutralized, opposite rudder is almost never used. Adverse yaw {{created by the}} rolling surfaces (ailerons, differential horizontal tails, etc.) of such aircraft is often more effective in arresting the spin rotation than the rudder(s), which usually become blanked by the wing and fuselage due to the geometric arrangement of fighters. Hence, the preferred recover technique has a pilot applying full roll control {{in the direction of}} the rotation (i.e., a right-hand spin requires a right stick input), generally remembered as [...] "stick into the spin". Likewise, this control application is reversed for <b>inverted</b> <b>spins.</b>|$|R
50|$|The XP-77 {{proved to}} be {{difficult}} to fly and despite flying without guns or armor, it did not come up to the expected performance estimates mainly because it was woefully underpowered. Further trials were conducted at the USAAF Proving Ground at Eglin Field with the second aircraft, which was destroyed when it entered an <b>inverted</b> <b>spin</b> while attempting an Immelmann, and the pilot bailed out. The development was terminated in December 1944.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first step}} in the PARE spin {{recovery}} sequence is to reduce power to idle. The second step is to neutralize the ailerons (and retract the flaps, if deployed). The third step is to apply and hold full rudder in the opposite direction of the spin rotation. The fourth step is to displace the elevator control toward its neutral position (forward movement when recovering from an upright spin; aft movement when recovering from an <b>inverted</b> <b>spin).</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{first test}} flight was {{conducted}} by Harold Dale on 30 March 1956. The aircraft completed several spin tests, but during one test the canopy opened and the aircraft went into an <b>inverted</b> <b>spin.</b> The pilot bailed out safely and the prototype crashed after performing an unmanned inverted loop. It was later found that the trim tab was set to full nose-down attitude during the test. A scheduled demonstration of the aircraft for the U.S. Navy was canceled. No other Weejets were produced.|$|E

40|$|An {{arterial}} spin labeling technique using separate RF labeling and imaging coils {{was used}} to obtain multislice perfusion images {{of the human brain}} at 3 T. Continuous RF irradiation at a peak power of 0. 3 W was applied to the carotid arteries to adiabatically <b>invert</b> <b>spins.</b> Labeling was achieved without producing magnetization transfer effects since the B 1 field of the labeling coil did not extend into the imaging region or couple significant power into the imaging coil. Eliminating magnetization transfer allowed the acquisition of multislice perfusion images of arbitrary orientation. Combining surface coil labeling with a reduced RF duty cycle permitted significantly lower SAR than single coil approaches. The technique was also found to allow selective labeling of blood in either carotid, providing an assessment of the artery’s perfusion territory. In normal subjects, these territories were well-defined and localized to the ipsilateral hemisphere. Mag...|$|R
40|$|Exploiting {{adiabatic}} {{passages of}} the spin transitions, this thesis reports sensitivity enhancements of the MAS and MQMAS experiments on half-integer quadrupolar nuclei.

Some details of maneuvers {{turned out to be}} extremely difficult for the pilots not only technically, but also psychologically. A speed of about 300 km/h was maintained when conducting a loop maneuver, which would cause the aircraft to stall. This required high skills from the pilots to not fall into an <b>inverted</b> <b>spin.</b> It is very difficult to do a barrel roll and conduct it in sync with the entire group, even though it seems easy from the ground.

5000|$|At the 1951 at Farnborough Airshow, Żurakowski {{demonstrated}} a new aerobatics manoeuvre, the [...] "Zurabatic Cartwheel", {{in which he}} suspended the Gloster Meteor G-7-1 prototype he was flying in a vertical cartwheel. [...] "This jet manoeuvre was the first new aerobatic in 20 years." [...] The cartwheel used the dangerously asymmetric behaviour the Meteor had with one engine throttled back. It started with a vertical climb to 4,000 feet, by which point the aircraft had slowed to only 80 mph. Cutting the power of one engine caused the Meteor to pivot. When the nose was pointing downwards, the second engine was throttled back. The aircraft continued to rotate through a further 360 degrees on momentum alone, having lost nearly all vertical velocity. Carrying out the cartwheel and recovering from it without entering an <b>inverted</b> <b>spin</b> (which the Meteor could not be brought out of) required great skill.|$|E
40|$|A {{supplementary}} {{investigation to}} determine the effect of external fuel tanks on the spin and recovery characteristics of a l/ 28 -scale model of the North American FJ- 4 airplane has been conducted in the Langley 20 -foot free-spinning tunnel. The model had been extensively tested previously (NACA Research Memorandum SL 38 A 29) and therefore only brief tests were made to evaluate the effect of tank installation. Erect spin tests of the model indicate that flat-type spins-are more prevalent with 200 -gallon external fuel tanks than with tanks not installed. The recovery technique determined for spins without tanks, rudder reversal to full against the spin accompanied by simultaneous movement of ailerons to full with the spin, is recommended for spins encountered with external tanks installed. If <b>inverted</b> <b>spins</b> are encountered with external tanks installed, the tanks should be jettisoned and recovery attempted by rudder reversal to full against the spin with ailerons maintained at neutral...|$|R
40|$|Free-spinning-tunnel {{tests have}} been made on a 1 / 27 -scale model of the Douglas XF 3 D- 1 {{airplane}} to confirm a preliminary evaluation made of the airplane spin and recovery characteristics and previously reported.

The pedal force necessary to reverse the airplane rudder during a spin will be within the physical capabilities of the pilot. A 10 -foot-diameter parachute attached to {{the tail of the}} airplane (laid-out-flat diameter, drag coefficient 0. 7) or a 4. 5 -foot-diameter parachute attached to the outboard wing tip will be satisfactory for emergency spin recovery from demonstration spins.

50|$|Finally in April 1940, three {{aircraft}} designated I-180S were completed, {{these being}} {{similar to the}} I-180-3, but reverting to an open cockpit and the I-16 type wing structure. Their test flights were favorable. The new fighter resembled I-16 in agility but was more stable. Top speed was 575 km/h (357 mph). Major criticisms included the open canopy and poor build quality. It was believed that fixing these defects would raise the top speed to 600 km/h (373 mph). However, the I-180-3 prototype crashed on 6 July 1940, when it entered an <b>inverted</b> <b>spin</b> due to pilot error. The pilot was able to safely bail out. In preparation for production, Polikarpov produced the definitive I-180-5 with several modifications and M-88A engine without reduction gear. The aircraft could also accept the new M-89 engine with 1,007 kW (1,350 hp) (up to 1,165 kW (1,560 hp) with fuel injection) which would raise its top speed to over 650 km/h (404 mph). There was also a proposal for the I-180Sh with improved main landing gear.|$|E
50|$|The Grumman F-14 Tomcat {{with the}} TF30-P-414A was underpowered, {{because it was}} the Navy's intent to procure a jet fighter with a thrust-to-weight ratio (in clean configuration) of unity or better (the US Air Force had the same goals for the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon). However, due to the intent to {{incorporate}} as many of the systems of the failed Navy version of the F-111, the F-111B, into the project, it was deemed that the initial production run of F-14s utilize the F-111B's powerplant. The F-14A's thrust-to-weight ratio was similar to the F-4 Phantom II; however the new fuselage and wing design provided greater lift and a better climb profile than the F-4. The TF30 was found to be ill-adapted to the demands of air combat and was prone to compressor stalls at high angle of attack (AOA) if the throttles were moved aggressively. Because of the Tomcat's widely spaced engine nacelles, compressor stalls at high AOA were especially dangerous because they tended to produce asymmetric thrust that could send the Tomcat into an upright or <b>inverted</b> <b>spin,</b> from which recovery was very difficult.|$|E

40|$|The S= 1 / 2 {{frustrated}} Heisenberg chains with bond alternation {{is known}} to exhibit a magnetization plateau at half of the saturation magnetization accompanied by the spontanuous translational symmetry breakdown. The effect of randomness on the magnetization process of this model is investigated. First we consider the mixture of the two kinds of chains both of which possess the / 2 -plateau in the common interval of the magnetization field. The plateau at / 2 is found to vanish immediately if the randomness is switched on in agreement with Totsuka's prediction. The small plateau also appears near the saturation field due to the localization of <b>inverted</b> <b>spins</b> around the minority bond. On the other hand, if the stronger bond is replaced by the ferromagnetic bonds randomly, the randomness induced fractional plateau appears as in the nonfrustrated case.

The effects of control settings and movements upon the erect-spin and recovery characteristics for the flight gross-weight loading with normal center-of-gravity and rearward center-of-gravity positions were determined. For the inverted-spin tests, the flight gross-weight loading with normal center-of-gravity position was used. Brief tests were also made with the radome removed {{to determine the effect}} of the radome on the spin and recovery characteristics of the airplane.

With the radome removed, the spin will be steeper and considerably more oscillatory than with the radome on.
