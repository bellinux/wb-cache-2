He was employed as an editor for various publications in the New York area. In October, he considered running for office as a Whig but did not receive the party's support. In 1837 he was licensed as a Baptist clergyman, although <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> permanent congregation.|$|E
5|$|Upon his retirement, Butler {{bought a}} home in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, where {{he lived with his}} wife. In June 1940, he checked himself into the {{hospital}} after becoming sick a few weeks earlier. His doctor described his illness as an incurable condition of the upper gastro-intestinal tract that was probably cancer. His family remained by his side, even bringing his new car so he could see it from the window. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> chance to drive it. On June 21, 1940, Smedley Butler died in the Naval Hospital in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|After much speculation, Manning {{announced}} in the offseason that he would return for his 18th season in the NFL. In the season opener against the Baltimore Ravens, Manning's play seemed to have deteriorated, going 24–40 for 175 yards and one interception, but a pick-6 by cornerback Aqib Talib allowed the Broncos to win 19–13. The Broncos {{got off to a}} dominant 7–0 start to the season; however, the streak ended in a loss at Indianapolis, losing 24–27. During that winning streak, and the loss in Indianapolis, Manning played better, putting up over 250 yards in six of the seven games, and he scored nine touchdowns. However, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> game without an interception, bringing his 8-game TD–INT ratio to 9–13, and the Broncos needed a hardworking defense to contribute for victories.|$|E

5|$|Rabi's Molecular Beam Laboratory {{began to}} attract others, {{including}} Sidney Millman, {{a graduate student}} who studied lithium for his doctorate. Another was Jerrold Zacharias who, believing that the sodium nucleus would be too difficult to understand, proposed studying the simplest of the elements, hydrogen. Its deuterium isotope had only recently been discovered at Columbia in 1931 by Urey, who received the 1934 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work. Urey was able to supply them with both heavy water and gaseous deuterium for their experiments. Despite its simplicity, Stern's group in Hamburg had observed that hydrogen did not behave as predicted. Urey also helped in another way; he gave Rabi half his prize money to fund the Molecular Beam Laboratory. Other scientists whose careers began at the Molecular Beam Laboratory included Norman Ramsey, Julian Schwinger, Jerome Kellogg and Polykarp Kusch. All were men; Rabi {{did not believe that}} women could be physicists. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> woman as a doctoral or postdoctoral student, and generally opposed women as candidates for faculty positions.|$|E

To Jimmy's surprise, his body stretches, similar to Plastic Man and the Elongated Man, meaning Killer Croc cannot penetrate his skin.|$|E
25|$|Lombardi {{began his}} {{coaching}} {{career as an}} assistant and later {{as a head coach}} at St. Cecilia High School in Englewood, New Jersey. He was an assistant coach at Fordham, at the United States Military Academy, and with the New York Giants before becoming a head coach for the Green Bay Packers from 1959 to 1967 and the Washington Redskins in 1969. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> losing season as a head coach in the NFL, compiling a regular season winning percentage of 72.8% (96–34–6), and 90% (9–1) in the postseason for an overall record of 105 wins, 35 losses, and 6 ties in the NFL.|$|E

25|$|Janequin {{was born}} in Châtellerault, near Poitiers, though no {{documents}} survive which establish any details of his early life or training. His career was highly unusual for his time, in that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> regular position with a cathedral or an aristocratic court. Instead he {{held a series of}} minor positions, often with important patronage. In 1505 he was employed as a clerk in Bordeaux, to Lancelot du Fau, who eventually became Bishop of Luçon; he retained this position until du Fau's death in 1523, at which time he took a position with the Bishop of Bordeaux. Around this time he became a priest, though his appointments were rarely lucrative; indeed he always complained about money.|$|E
25|$|Florida posted another 9–1–1 {{record in}} 1985, Hall's first full season as head coach, and was briefly ranked {{number one in}} the AP Poll {{for the first time in}} school history. The Gators {{finished}} the season atop the SEC standings, but were ineligible for the conference title. Although <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> losing season, Hall's subsequent teams did not match his early success when the scholarship losses for Pell's violations took their full effect; his first two recruiting classes had only 25 players. The unranked 1986 Gators upset the Auburn Tigers, 18–17. Kerwin Bell led the Gators to overcome a 17–0 fourth-quarter deficit in a game still considered one of the most dramatic in Florida Field history.|$|E
25|$|I {{wanted to}} make a Flash Gordon movie, with all the trimmings, but I couldn't obtain the rights to the characters. So I began researching and went right back and found where Alex Raymond (who had done the {{original}} Flash Gordon comic strips in newspapers) had got his idea from. I discovered that he'd got his inspiration from the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs (author of Tarzan) and especially from his John Carter of Mars series books. I read through that series, then found that what had sparked Burroughs off was a science-fantasy called , written by Edwin Arnold and published in 1905. That was the first story in this genre that I have been able to trace. Jules Verne had got pretty close, I suppose, but <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> hero battling against space creatures or having adventures on another planet. A whole new genre developed from that idea.|$|E

25|$|One of Raj's biggest {{personality}} quirks is his {{tendency to}} speak or act inappropriately, often landing him in trouble or {{leading to an}} angry reaction from whomever he has upset. This was particularly pronounced when he was {{under the influence of}} alcohol, which could cause a catch-22, since for years he needed alcohol to even speak to a woman, but the alcohol led to him say the wrong things. On one occasion, just as Leonard and Penny are about to have sex in their hotel room, Raj enters and obliviously proceeds to climb into Sheldon's recently vacated bed, completely unaware of what he has interrupted. On another occasion, he openly discussed having had crushes on Penny and Bernadette directly in front of them, which caused both discomfort, and unwittingly hurting Amy's feelings when he admits that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> crush on her as well (despite Penny and Bernadette's best efforts to alert him to this fact).|$|E
25|$|King lost in {{the first}} round of the PDC World Championship for the first time in its 2013 edition 2–3 to Dean Winstanley. The match has been {{described}} as a classic with both players missing darts to win before Winstanley took the deciding set 6–4. His first final of the year came at the eighth UK Open Qualifier in April, having won seven games including defeats over James Wade, Wes Newton and Robert Thornton, but he was then whitewashed 0–6 by Michael van Gerwen. He was the seventh seed for the UK Open itself. King reached the final of the Austrian Darts Open by beating Joe Cullen 6–0 in the quarter-finals with an average of 103.66 and Steve Beaton 6–5 in the semis. He faced van Gerwen once more in the final and was defeated 3–6. He also played van Gerwen in the third round of the UK Open and was defeated 5–9. King's second European Tour final of the year came in September at the German Darts Masters where he edged past Peter Wright 6–5 in the third round, whitewashed James Wade 6–0 in the quarter-finals and beat Wayne Jones 6–4 in the semis. He faced Steve Beaton and with the final on throw with Beaton 4–3 ahead King incredibly burst his score when on 134 as he hit a treble 20 with his last dart instead of a single to leave 40. Beaton replied by finishing 160 and, even though King fought back to take the match into a deciding leg, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> dart for the title as Beaton won 6–5. King could not replicate his performances at the World Grand Prix from last year as he was defeated 2–0 in sets by Wayne Jones {{in the first round}}.|$|E
