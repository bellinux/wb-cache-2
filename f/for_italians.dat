25|$|Bismarck {{maintained}} {{good relations}} with Italy, although he had a personal dislike <b>for</b> <b>Italians</b> and their country. He {{can be seen as}} a marginal contributor to Italian unification. Politics surrounding the 1866 Austro-Prussian War allowed Italy to annex Venetia, which had been a kronland ("crown land") of the Austrian Empire since the 1815 Congress of Vienna. In addition, French mobilization for the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871 made it necessary for Napoleon III to withdraw his troops from Rome and The Papal States. Without these two events, Italian unification would have been a more prolonged process.|$|E
25|$|Joseph Cuccia was a well-respected {{criminal}} {{amongst the}} underworld, {{who served as}} a translator in court <b>for</b> <b>Italians</b> who didn't speak English. This made him a well liked man in the Italian community. When prominent Black Hand leader Joseph Ardizzone was involved in a dispute with George Maisano, a member of the Matranga gang, they both went to Cuccia to mediate the dispute. Cuccia was a relative of Ardizzone's and ruled in Ardizzone's favor, causing the Matrangas to threaten Cuccia. In response, Ardizzone shot and killed Maisano on July 2, 1906. Ardizzone then fled authorities and became a wanted fugitive.|$|E

500|$|The fall of Rome on 4 June 1944 placed Kesselring in a {{dangerous}} situation as his forces attempted to withdraw from Rome to the Gothic Line. That the Germans were especially vulnerable to Italian partisans {{was not lost on}} the British General Harold Alexander, who appealed in a radio broadcast <b>for</b> <b>Italians</b> to kill Germans [...] "wherever you encounter them". Kesselring responded by authorising the [...] "massive employment of artillery, grenade and mine throwers, armoured cars, flamethrowers and other technical combat equipment" [...] against the partisans. He also issued an order promising indemnity to soldiers who [...] "exceed our normal restraint". Subsequently, massacres were carried out by the Hermann Göring Panzer Division at Stia in April, Civitella in Val di Chiana in June and Bucine in July 1944, by the 26th Panzer Division at Padule di Fucecchio on 23 August 1944, and by the 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsführer-SS at Sant'Anna di Stazzema in August 1944 and Marzabotto in September and October 1944.|$|E

However, a mob stormed the jail and lynched eleven Italian-Americans. Local historians still debate whether some of those lynched were connected to the Mafia, but most agree {{that a number of}} innocent people were lynched during the Chief Hennessy Riot. The government of Italy protested, as some of those lynched were still Italian citizens, and the government of the U.S. eventually paid reparations to Italy.|$|E
2500|$|Italy {{after its}} {{unification}} {{did not seek}} nationalism but instead sought work. Sadly, a unified state did not automatically constitute a sound economy.

The Brooklyn Eagle explained a problem Johnson had with a particular Italian family in a home [...] "which {{at the time was}} owned by Walter L.

His diary entry for 1 September 1945 (in Yokohama) reads in part: [...] "What a kick to stare at the arrogant, ugly, moon-faced, buck-toothed, bowlegged bastards, and realize where this puts them. Many newly demobilized soldiers around. Most police salute. People generally just apathetic. We gloated over the destruction & came in at 3:00 feeling fine." ...|$|E
2500|$|Life <b>for</b> <b>Italians</b> under German {{occupation}} was hard, {{especially in}} Rome. Rome's citizens by 1943 had {{grown tired of}} the war and upon Italy signing an armistice with the Allies on 8 September 1943, Rome's citizens took to the streets chanting [...] "Viva la pace!" [...] ("Long live the peace!), but within hours German forces raided the city and attacked anti-Fascists, royalists and Jews. Roman citizens were harassed by German soldiers to provide them food and fuel and German authorities would arrest all opposition and many were sent into forced labor. Rome's citizens upon being liberated reported that {{during the first week of}} German occupation of Rome, crimes against Italian citizens took place as German soldiers looted stores and robbed Roman citizens at gunpoint. Martial law was imposed on Rome by German authorities requiring all citizens to obey a curfew forbidding people to be out on the street after 9 p.m. During winter of 1943, Rome's citizens were denied access to sufficient food, firewood and coal which was taken by German authorities to be given to German soldiers housed in occupied hotels. These actions left Rome's citizens to live in the harsh cold and on the verge of starvation. German authorities began arresting able-bodied Roman men to be conscripted into forced labour. On 4 June 1944, the German occupation of Rome came to an end as German forces retreated as the Allies advanced.|$|E

6000|$|When all was over, an Italian statesman {{wrote to}} Panizzi that though he thought Garibaldi {{one of the}} choicest natures ever created,—enterprising, humane, disinterested, eminent in {{national}} service, yet neither he nor any other citizen was entitled to set himself above the laws of his country, and that such a man should be officially received by {{the heir to the}} throne and by secretaries of state, was a thing to be bitterly deplored by every sensible man.(85) Still history can afford to agree with Mr. Gladstone when he said of Garibaldi—“His name is indeed illustrious, it remains inseparably connected with the not less illustrious name of the great Cavour, and these two names are again associated with the name of Victor Emmanuel.

60|$|You {{need not}} fear that I shall try to {{entangle}} {{you or your}} countrymen in the matters which it is <b>for</b> <b>Italians</b> alone to decide. You know the perils of either course much better than I do. Italy, most assuredly, has no need to prove her courage. She has risked everything in standing out that she could risk by coming in. The proclamations and press of Germany make it plain that the Germans have risen to a height of sensibility hardly to be distinguished from madness. Supposing the nightmare of a Prussian victory, they will revenge themselves on things more remote than the Triple Alliance. There was a promise of peace between them and Belgium; there was none between them and England. The promise to Belgium they broke. The promise of England they invented. It is called the Treaty of Teutonism. No one ever heard of it in this country; but it seems well known in academic circles in Germany. It seems to be something, connected with the colour of one's hair. But I repeat that I am not concerned to interfere with your decision, save {{in so far as}} I may provide some materials for it by describing our own.|$|E
60|$|Sir Hudson (that {{you could}} have seen his regimentals!) was a perfect mammoth of a man, to Napoleon; hideously ugly, with a monstrously disproportionate face, and a great clump for the lower- jaw, to express his tyrannical and obdurate nature. He began his system of persecution, by calling his {{prisoner}} 'General Buonaparte;' to which the latter replied, with the deepest tragedy, 'Sir Yew ud se on Low, call me not thus. Repeat that phrase and leave me! I am Napoleon, Emperor of France!' Sir Yew ud se on, nothing daunted, proceeded to entertain him with an ordinance of the British Government, regulating the state he should preserve, and the furniture of his rooms: and limiting his attendants to four or five persons. 'Four or five for ME!' said Napoleon. 'Me! One hundred thousand men were lately at my sole command; and this English officer talks {{of four or five}} for ME!' Throughout the piece, Napoleon (who talked very like the real Napoleon, and was, for ever, having small soliloquies by himself) was very bitter on 'these English officers,' and 'these English soldiers;' to the great satisfaction of the audience, who were perfectly delighted to have Low bullied; and who, whenever Low said 'General Buonaparte' (which he always did: always receiving the same correction), quite execrated him. It would be hard to say why; <b>for</b> <b>Italians</b> have little cause to sympathise with Napoleon, Heaven knows.|$|E
