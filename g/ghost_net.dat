The organization also presented an important work <b>Ghost</b> <b>Net</b> by the organization Trash Patch at the Tapestry Building located in East Harlem for the summer as well. <b>Ghost</b> <b>Net</b> was a timely installation because it held in between the time an Atlantic trash patch was discovered and the BP Gulf oil spill off the coast of Louisiana. The <b>Ghost</b> <b>Net</b> installation allowed the public to discover what a real trash patch would look like underwater.|$|E

40|$|In Australia, {{the olive}} ridley sea turtle Lepidochelys olivacea has {{received}} little research attention and monitoring. The Australian populations {{are relatively small}} and their distribution is limited to remote areas {{in the northern part of}} the country. Previous global genetic studies of olive ridley populations showed that the Australian breeding population at the McCluer Group of islands, Northern Territory, is genetically distinct from other olive ridley populations breeding in the Indo-Pacific. However, nothing is known about the genetic stock structure among Australian olive ridley rookeries found across northern Australia. High predation of eggs by feral pigs, dogs and monitor lizards Varanus spp. is believed to have severely impacted the number of nesting females at some rookeries. Of particular concern is the small nesting population on the western Cape York Peninsula, and without immediate conservation action this population could face extinction. The results presented here establish that there are at least 2 independent management units (stocks) of olive ridley turtles nesting in Australia and emphasise the importance of conserving the genetically distinct small breeding population nesting along the western Cape York Peninsula. In addition, results from 44 turtles caught in ghost nets across the Gulf of Carpentaria revealed that 45 % of the haplotypes (32 % of all <b>ghost</b> <b>net</b> samples) had not been observed at any rookery in Australia or SE Asia. This research highlights the need for better information on olive ridley population structure in the region and for urgent conservation action for the western Cape York population...|$|E
40|$|How {{much of the}} planet’s {{biodiversity}} is conserved will {{be determined}} by how many and how much people are motivated (morally and otherwise) to participate in conservation reform, as social and political activists – working to reform laws and policies, social norms, and business practices – and in their lifestyles, by reducing their own ecological footprints’ (Booth 2009 : 55). ‘Unmaking’ problems like waste begins by inspiring people with a sense of personal agency in changing the world for the better and in providing opportunities to participate in that change. This ‘grassroots’ approach to unmaking waste has occurred with the Australian phenomenon of GhostNets art, in which making art is about ‘unmaking’ marine debris. GhostNets art developed principally as an initiative in Indigenous communities to recycle marine debris fishing nets found in northern Australia’s Arafura Sea. These nets form into an ecologically harmful mass that can range up to several thousand tonnes in weight and drift with the currents similarly to un-navigated ‘ghost ships’ – hence the name GhostNets. Making art out of retrieved nets originated as a recycling initiative but quickly developed into a nation-wide collaborative campaign in marine debris awareness. GhostNets art is now well known across Australia however scholarship is yet to examine the efficacy of the participatory basis of this artform and the inspirational role of Indigenous Australians in applying customary practices of ‘caring for country’ to art about marine debris eradication. This essay considers how the participatory network of the GhostNets Art program and its subsequent manifestation as the <b>Ghost</b> <b>Net</b> Art Project (GNAP) provides an iconic structure where individuals can shape their values about caring for the environment, and where an environmental ethic about the biological imperative of marine rehabilitation is personalized through the sensory language of art...|$|E

30|$|The {{impacts of}} {{environmental}} plastics on the ecosystem are manifold, although our knowledge {{is still very}} fragmentary. Most attention is attributed to the detrimental effects of large plastic items on marine vertebrates. Often, birds, dolphins, fish, and turtles misinterpret plastic debris as prey. Extensive ingestion will result in obstruction and malfunction of the digestive tract. Likewise, animals can become entangled in plastics (e.g., in so-called <b>ghost</b> <b>nets).</b> Both events will cause starvation and eventually mortality [[8]]. Other effects of plastics are less visible; the ingestion of microplastics has been documented {{for a range of}} marine and freshwater species. In addition, there are reports that microplastics will accumulate along the food web. However, the biological effects of microplastics remain largely unstudied (see [[9]] for details).|$|R

50|$|Entanglement {{in plastic}} debris has been {{responsible}} for the deaths of many marine organisms, such as fish, seals, turtles, and birds. These animals get caught in the debris and end up suffocating or drowning. Because they are unable to untangle themselves, they also die from starvation or from their inability to escape predators. Being entangled also often results in severe lacerations and ulcers. In a 2006 report known as Plastic Debris in the World's Oceans, it was estimated that at least 267 different animal species have suffered from entanglement and ingestion of plastic debris. It has been estimated that over 400,000 marine mammals perish annually due to plastic pollution in oceans. Marine organisms get caught in discarded fishing equipment, such as <b>ghost</b> <b>nets.</b> Ropes and nets used to fish are often made of synthetic materials such as nylon, making fishing equipment more durable and buoyant. These organisms can also get caught in circular plastic packaging materials, and if the animal continues to grow in size, the plastic can cut into their flesh. Equipment such as nets can also drag along the seabed, causing damage to coral reefs.|$|R
