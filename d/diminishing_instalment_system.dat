6000|$|By a {{circuitous}} route, indeed, the Marxist {{reaches a}} moral position curiously analogous {{to that of}} the disciple of Herbert Spencer. Since all improvement will arrive by leaving things alone, the worse things get, the better; for so much the nearer one comes to the final exasperation, to the class war and the Triumph of the Proletariat. This certainty of victory in the nature of things makes the Marxists difficult in politics, pedantic sticklers for the letter of the teaching, obstinate opponents of what they call [...] "Palliatives"--of any <b>instalment</b> <b>system</b> of reform. They wait until they can make the whole journey in one stride, and would, in the meanwhile, have no one set forth upon the way. In America the Marxist fatalism has found a sort of supreme simplification in the gospel of Mr. H. G. Wilshire. The Trusts, one learns, are to consolidate all the industry in the country, own all the property. Then when they own everything, the Nation will take them over. [...] "Let the Nation own the Trusts!" [...] The Nation {{in the form of a}} public, reading capitalistic newspapers, inured to capitalistic methods, represented and ruled by capital-controlled politicians, will suddenly take over the Trusts and begin a new system....|$|R
40|$|On 1 July 2000, the Australian Federal Government {{replaced}} the Pay As You Earn system (PAYE) {{and various other}} tax systems with the Pay As You Go (PAYG) system. The PAYG legislation contains the PAYG withholding system and the PAYG <b>instalment</b> <b>system.</b> The PAYG withholding system is comprised of a single set of rules that applies to all withholding tax payments. This article examines {{a number of recent}} Australian court decisions in which the Commissioner of Taxation (Commissioner) has taken legal action against directors in their personal capacity for nonpayment of PAYG withholding tax. The case law demonstrates that the Courts narrowly interpret the relevant statutory defences with directors being held personally liable for their company’s debts. This article addresses the PAYG withholding tax providing an overview of the obligations placed on company directors to remit PAYG withholding tax on time. In sections II and III it provides and overview of the legislative provisions. Sections IV and V examine the penalty provisions which can be invoked by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) when directors fail to comply with their obligations and also provides an overview of the approach taken by the courts when the ATO institutes proceedings against company directors who have breached the withholding tax provisions. Section VI sets out the conclusions. 14 page(s...|$|R
60|$|Once, I remembered, in our {{schoolmaster}} days, when guineas, though regular, were few, he had {{had occasion}} to increase his wardrobe. If I recollect rightly, {{he thought he had}} a chance of a good position in the tutoring line, and only needed good clothes to make it his. He took four pounds of his salary in advance,--he was in the habit of doing this: he never had any salary left by the end of term, it having vanished in advance loans beforehand. With this he was to buy two suits, a hat, new boots, and collars. When it came to making the purchases, he found, what he had overlooked previously in his optimistic way, that four pounds did not go very far. At the time, I remember, I thought his method of grappling with the situation humorous. He bought a hat for three-and-sixpence, and got the suits and the boots on the <b>instalment</b> <b>system,</b> paying a small sum in advance, as earnest of more to come. He then pawned one suit to pay for the first few instalments, and finally departed, to be known no more. His address he had given--with a false name--at an empty house, and when the tailor arrived with his minions of the law, all he found was an annoyed caretaker, and a pile of letters written by himself, containing his bill in its various stages of evolution.|$|R

Nothing {{could have been more}} manly and straightforward than my attitude. I told them in my last letter but three that I proposed to let them have the eggs on the Times <b>instalment</b> <b>system,</b> and they said I was frivolous. They said that to send thirteen eggs as payment for goods supplied to the value of 25 pounds 1s. 8 1/2 d. was mere trifling. Trifling, I'll trouble you! That's the spirit in which they meet my suggestions. It was Harrod who did that. I've never met Harrod personally, but I'd like to, just to ask him if that's his idea of cementing amiable business relations. He knows just as well as anyone else that without credit commerce has no elasticity. It's an elementary rule. I'll bet he'd have been sick if chappies had refused to let him have tick when he was starting his store. Do you suppose Harrod, when he started in business, paid cash down on the nail for everything? Not a bit of it. He went about taking people by the coat-button and asking them to be good chaps and wait till Wednesday week. Trifling! Why, those thirteen eggs were absolutely all we had over after Mrs. Beale had taken what she wanted for the kitchen. As a matter of fact, if it's anybody's fault, it's Mrs. Beale's. That woman literally eats eggs." ...|$|R

60|$|The {{category}} No. 4, {{brought up}} a member who had made political economy his chief study. This person presented the following case:--According to his calculations, the wrong had been committed precisely sixty-three years, and twenty-six days, and two-thirds of a day ago. For the whole of that long period Leaplow had been troubled with this vexatious question, which had hung like a cloud over the otherwise unimpaired brightness of her political landscape. It {{was time to get}} rid of it. The sum stipulated was just twenty-five millions, to be paid in twenty-five annual instalments, of a million each. Now, he proposed to reduce the instalments to one-half the number, but in no way to change the sum. That point ought to be considered as irrevocably settled. This would diminish the debt one-half. Before the first instalment should become due he would effect a postponement, by <b>diminishing</b> the <b>instalments</b> again to six, referring the time to the latest periods named in the last treaty, and always most sacredly keeping the sums precisely the same. It would be impossible to touch the sums, which, he repeated, ought to be considered as sacred. Before the expiration of the first seven years, a new arrangement might reduce the instalments to two, or even to one--always respecting the sum; and finally, at the proper moment, a treaty could be concluded, declaring {{that there should be no}} instalment at all, reserving the point, that if there HAD been an instalment, Leaplow could never have consented to reduce it below one million. The result would be that in about five-and-twenty years the country would be fairly rid of the matter, and the national character, which it was agreed on all hands was even now as high as it well could be, would probably be raised many degrees higher. The negotiations had commenced in a spirit of compromise; and our character for consistency required that this spirit of compromise should continue to govern our conduct as long as a single farthing remained unpaid.|$|R

The game's first home version was released for the MSX2 on February 10, 1987, with minor gameplay adjustments. On August 28, 1987, a version for the Disk System was released entitled KiKi KaiKai: Dotouhen, which added two-player support {{and a new}} playable character, [...] "Miki-chan". A PC Engine version was released three years later on March 27, 1990, which was largely based on the previous Disk <b>System</b> <b>instalment.</b> The game made the jump from consoles on June 12, 2003, when Taito developed a java-based version of KiKi KaiKai for mobile phones called KiKi KaiKai: The Bizarre World. A port programmed by MediaKite appeared on May 14, 2004 for Windows-based PCs, and a web-based game service was launched on Taito's Japanese website later that year courtesy of EZWeb.|$|R
