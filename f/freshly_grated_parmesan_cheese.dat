40|$|The <b>grated</b> <b>Parmesan</b> <b>cheese</b> {{is among}} the most {{consumed}} cheese in the country and also among the most fraudulent, since the fragmentation facilitates the incorporation of various adulterants. Brazilian law establishes as the parameters to be evaluated in grated cheese only the moisture content and the fat content in dry matter (GES). However, it is important to analyze other parameters, in order to characterize the products commercialized in Brazil, as quality can be compromised. The objective {{of this study was to}} analyze the chemical composition and presence of starch in different samples of <b>grated</b> <b>Parmesan</b> <b>cheese,</b> commercialized in the city of Paranavaí, Paraná. Fifteen samples were analyzed, being three different batches of five brands. The chemical composition (moisture, ash, carbohydrates, proteins and lipids) differed from one sample to another; however, all samples were in compliance with Brazilian legislation, considering the moisture content. For the GES content, 60 % of the samples showed values higher than those established by Brazilian legislation for semi-fat <b>cheese,</b> such as <b>grated</b> <b>Parmesan</b> <b>cheese.</b> One sample showed a high carbohydrate content, however, starch was not detected by the lugol test. It is concluded that 60 % of grated cheese commercialized in the city of Paranavaí present disagreement with Brazilian law, because they had higher fat content in the dry matter than the established...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: With the {{objective}} {{to evaluate the}} hygienic and sanitary conditions of <b>grated</b> <b>parmesan</b> <b>cheese</b> acquired from the retail business, total 120 cheese samples were acquired: 60 of which were obtained from four different brands of cheese that were grated in factories, and the other 60 samples were obtained from another four brands of cheese that are normally acquired by retailers (supermarkets) in blocks and grated {{at the moment of}} sale. The population of heterotrophic mesophilic microorganisms ranged from 1. 2 × 10 ³ to 1. 1 × 107 colony-forming units (CFU) ·g- 1. All samples analyzed contained Staphylococcus spp. with populations varying from 1. 2 × 10 ³ to 8. 7 × 106 CFU·g- 1, from which 60. 0 % were classified as coagulase-positive Staphylococcus and 52. 5 % of the samples possessed populations above the permissible limit set by legislation. Staphylococcus aureus was detected in 57. 5 % of the samples. Population of molds and yeasts varied from < 10 to 1. 8 × 106 CFU·g- 1. Salmonella spp. was not isolated in this research. A difference was observed between the <b>parmesan</b> <b>cheese</b> <b>grated</b> in factories and that grated in supermarkets, where the former presented better microbiological quality than the latter. Thus, procedures must be proposed to minimize the presence of pathogenic agents reported in <b>grated</b> <b>parmesan</b> <b>cheeses</b> evaluated in the present study because of the public health risk associated with food bacterial contamination...|$|R

50|$|The rice {{is first}} cooked briefly in a soffritto of onion and butter or olive oil, to coat each grain {{in a film}} of fat, called tostatura; white wine is added and must be absorbed by the grains. When it has been absorbed the heat is raised to medium high, and boiling stock is {{gradually}} added in small amounts, while stirring constantly. The constant stirring, with {{only a small amount}} of liquid present, forces the grains to rub against each other and release the starch molecules from the outside of the grains into the surrounding liquid, creating a smooth creamy-textured mass. When the rice is cooked the pot is taken off the heat for mantecatura, vigorously beating in refrigerated balls of <b>grated</b> <b>parmesan</b> <b>cheese</b> and butter, to make the texture as creamy and smooth as possible. It may be removed from the heat a few minutes earlier and left to cook with its residual heat.|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the occurrence of AFM 1 contamination in the samples of <b>grated</b> <b>parmesan</b> <b>cheese</b> marketed in the Metropolitan Region of Rio de Janeiro -Brazil. Thirty samples representing 10 major brands marketed in the region were analyzed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) after purification with immunoaffinity column. The method showed recovery values {{within the range of}} 70 - 90 %, with RSD lower than 15 % and limits of detection and quantification below the maximum level allowed by the European Commission for the presence of AFM 1 in cheeses. The mycotoxin was identified in 18 (60 %) of the grated cheese samples tested. The highest value corresponded to 0. 69 ± 0. 02 µg/kg and the mean for all the analyzed samples was 0. 16 µg/kg. All the samples were lower than the limit established by the Brazilian legislation (2. 5 µg/kg) for AFM 1 in cheeses in general. However, eight samples (26. 7 %) presented AFM 1 levels above the tolerance limit of 0. 25 µg/kg adopted by the European Commission. These results indicated that AFM 1 levels in the grated cheese consumed in Rio de Janeiro -Brazil were relatively high and it could provide a potential hazard for the public health...|$|R

50|$|Grated {{cheese is}} a type of cheese that has gone through the process of being grated. Typically, aged hard cheeses are used for this purpose. A hand grater can be used to {{manually}} grate the cheese, or cheese can be bought already grated. Commercially produced grated cheeses are often blends of more than one variety of cheese, such as Pecorino and <b>Parmesan.</b> <b>Grated</b> <b>cheese</b> and shredded cheese are not the same thing. Grated cheese is much finer than shredded cheese and reacts differently in recipes or application to cooked foods.|$|R
5000|$|What {{are known}} as braciole in the United States are called involtini in Italy.Involtini can be thin slices of beef, pork, or chicken rolled with a filling of <b>grated</b> <b>cheese</b> (usually <b>Parmesan</b> <b>cheese</b> or Pecorino Romano), {{sometimes}} egg to give consistency and some combination of additional ingredients such as bread crumbs, other cheeses, minced prosciutto, ham or Italian sausage, mushrooms, onions, garlic, spinach, pinoli (pine nuts), etc. Involtini (diminutive form of involti) means [...] "little bundles". Each involtino is held together by a wooden toothpick, and the dish is usually served (in various sauces: red, white, etc.) as a second course. When cooked in tomato sauce, the sauce itself is used to toss the pasta for the first course, giving a consistent taste to the whole meal.|$|R
40|$|Developing low-fat {{cheese with}} flavor to match that of full-fat cheese {{has been a}} {{challenge}} in the dairy industry. The objective {{of this investigation was}} to develop lower fat Cheddar and <b>Parmesan</b> <b>grated</b> <b>cheese</b> using supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and characterize its flavor profile comparative to a full-fat product. Specifically, enabling flavor compound partition between the matrices of cheese and extracted lipids. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) was the supercritical fluid for fat extraction. Extraction took place in a 500 mL SFE vessel using 100 g of grated cheese. Fractional factorial design was utilized to investigate two levels of treatment for each pressure (200 and 350 bar), temperature (35 and 40 °C) and CO 2 level (500 and 1000 g) for each extraction trial. The most efficient parameters for lipid removal resulted in 51. 00 % fat reduction (wet basis) for Cheddar extracted at 200 bar, 40 °C, 1000 g CO 2, and 55. 56 % fat reduction for Parmesan extracted at 350 bar, 35 °C, 1000 g CO 2. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was utilized to assess the lipid composition of each cheese and the lipids extracted by SFE. TLC analysis for Cheddar and <b>Parmesan</b> <b>cheeses</b> showed only nonpolar lipids (triaclyglycerides and free fatty acids) in the recovered lipids extracted by SFE; indicating that polar lipids such as phospholipids are being retained in the cheese matrix. Gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy techniques were used to characterize volatile flavor compounds for each cheese sample. SFE treatment of the cheeses altered the ability to detect flavor compounds and allowed partitioning of those compounds, which varied with the type of cheese. This study suggests that SFE technology can be used in the dairy industry to develop cheese products lower in fat, which retain flavor compounds that may not be typically fully developed with alternative methods of low-fat cheese processing...|$|R
