25|$|In May 2009, four {{children}} became ill when the attraction failed {{to stop at}} the end of its cycle. After returning to a horizontal position, a limit switch failed and the ride continued to spin for five to ten minutes. The park's first-aid staff treated the children, while one was transported to an area hospital by his parents; the child was not admitted, however. An investigation determined that the ride operator did not engage an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> <b>switch</b> due to a miscommunication between her and her supervisor; the park's ride operators are trained in how to stop their rides in the event of a malfunction. Since then, additional safety features have been added to ensure that the attraction automatically stops within 15 seconds if the limit switch were to fail.|$|E

25|$|The driverless tractor is {{considered}} controversial {{in terms of}} safety and public acceptance. A tractor operating without a driver makes some people nervous. Creating technology that stays safe in all scenarios where failure could possibly occur {{takes a lot of}} programming and time. In terms of motion detection, the tractors have sensors to stop them if they detect objects in their path such as people, animals, vehicles or other large objects. In 2004, researchers from the Danish Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University published a paper in which they examined the safety of a driverless tractor in detail. With their driverless tractor, they had one person designated as a safety operator. This operator controlled a switch which could immediately shut down and halt the tractor. They also wired four <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> <b>switches</b> on each corner of the tractor.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a newly developed safety concept for application of robotic walking simulators {{based on the}} principle of programmable footplates in gait rehabilitation. Unlike robotic hand devices or exoskeleton robots for gait training on treadmills, which can be built relatively lightweight and require only small drives which can hardly do harm to the patient, a programmable footplate walking simulator with permanent foot fixture essentially needs to have powerful drives in order to carry and move the full body weight of the patient. The developed safety concept comprises several redundant algorithms and devices in the real-time robot control software, electrical <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> circuitry and machine mechanics. The mechanical core is a machine design offering maximum passive security by covering all moving parts (i. e. robot drives and linkages) and a newly developed foot safety release binding, which is mounted on each footplate. The release binding allows a safe re lease from the footplate in all directions in any degree of freedom in the sagittal plane. It is combined with an ankle goniometer which is equipped with adjustable <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> limit <b>switches,</b> thus ensuring that the allowed ankle range-of-motion is not exceeded...|$|R
50|$|On large {{industrial}} machines, an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> button is typically {{located on the}} panel, and possibly in several {{other areas of the}} machine. Often, an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> is made wireless using a remote control. This provides a rapid means to disconnect the energy source of the device to protect workers. For fail-safe operation, the <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> button is a normally closed switch which ensures that a broken wire will neither accidentally activate the <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> nor prevent it from being activated.|$|R
5000|$|During 2000-2006, {{commercial}} fishing {{was one of}} the most dangerous occupations in the United States, with an average annual fatality rate of 115 deaths per 100,000 fishermen. Falling overboard specifically killed 182 fishermen in the period between 2000 and 2010. This fatality rate is 3 times that of the next most dangerous job in the U.S. and more than 25 times that of the national average across all workers. Also, between the years of 1919 and 2005, 4111 fishermen died in fishing related accidents in the United Kingdom industry alone. [...] These deaths are generally a result of a combination of severe weather conditions, extreme fatigue because any one fisherman usually puts in a 21-hour shift, and dangerous equipment. The U.S. Coast Guard has primary jurisdiction over the safety of the U.S. {{commercial fishing}} fleet, enforcing regulations of the U.S. Commercial Fishing Industry Vessel Safety Act of 1988 (CFIVSA). CFIVSA regulations focus primarily on saving lives after the loss of a vessel and not on preventing vessels from capsizing or sinking, falls overboard, or injuries on deck. CFIVSA regulations require that commercial fishing vessels carry various equipment (e.g., life rafts, radio beacons, and immersion suits) depending on the size of the vessel and the area in which it operates. Not all commercial fishermen follow safety regulations and advice. One study of Maine fishermen found that less than 25% of the fishermen interviewed had recent training in first aid or CPR, only 75% of the boats had survival suits and only 36% had a survival craft. Even the ships that did have the necessary equipment did not consistently have a captain that fully understood how to use the safety equipment.Common causes of fishing-related deaths include vessel disasters, falls overboard, and onboard injuries. The United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health Commercial Fishing Incident Database found that between 2000 and 2010, most vessel disasters often were initiated by flooding, vessel instability, and large waves, and that severe weather conditions contributed to a majority of fatal vessel disasters. Most falls overboard went unwitnessed, and in none of the cases documented was the victim wearing a personal flotation device (PFD). [...] Onboard injuries often result when a crew member is caught in a line and pulled into a winch on deck. The installation of a readily accessible <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> <b>switch</b> on the winch can potentially prevent these kinds of injuries.|$|E
40|$|The {{idea about}} the CyberBike came to Jens G. Balchen - {{the founder of the}} Department of Engineering Cybernetics (ITK) at NTNU - in the 1980 's. He wanted to make an {{unmanned}} autonomus bicycle, i. e. a bike that could run by itself. The idea was picked up by Amund Skavhaug, who started the CyberBike project in the late 80 's. After being deffered for some years, the CyberBike has again gained some attention. This master's thesis is based on Hans Olav Loftum's and Lasse Bjermeland's theses at the spring 2006 and the autumn project of John A. Fossum the same year. The goal of the CyberBike project is to make the bike work as intended, i. e. as an autonomous unmanned bicycle. This thesis naturally share this goal, although the bike did not become able to take its first autonomous trip within the thesis' time frame. At the start of the work, the bike were already equipped with a suitcase of computational hardware on its baggage rack, a small QNX Neutrino OS image was installed on the industrial PC mounted in the suitcase, and drivers for the installed motors, tachometers and potmeters were written. An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) was intended to supply the control system with the necessary information about rotation, acceleration and position, and the unit was purchased for the purpose. Also a driver was written, but not properly tested. The IMU had to be installed and connected to the control system. The bike's control theory was developed, but had never been put into action outside computer simulations (due to the lack of acceleration measurements). The various tasks that had to be addressed emerged as the development process advanced. First, the IMU had to be connected to the system, by making a signal tranceiver circuit. A small printed circuit board was designed and laid out, mainly to include a MAX 233 CPP iC. Then the DB- 9 serial connector on the bikes single board computer (Wafer- 9371 A) could be used to read the UART signal from the IMU as RS- 232. Then some testing had to be done, and drivers updated. A better and more advanced IMU (referred to as the "MTi") was added to the project. This unit needed no signal converting circuitry, but driver development and testing still had to be done. To enhance the CyberBike's navigation opportunities, a GPS module was purchased. A signal transceiving circuit, similar to the one for the IMU, was made for this unit, as well as software to read out the measurements from the device. By the end of this thesis, no navigational algorithms are made, hence the GPS is currently not used, but available for future efforts made on this area. Some hardware related tasks was carried out, as connecting and implementing functionality to the pendulum limit switches, installation of a <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> <b>switch</b> and a power switch, purchasing and installation of two 12 V batteries and a cooling fan. An operating system upgrade resulted in replacing the CyberBikePC's storage device, a compact flash card, with a mobile hard disk drive. Installation of a motor, for supplying torque to the rear wheel, included setup and tuning of a hardware based velocity controller in a Baldor TFM 060 - 06 - 01 - 3 servo module. However; this task is not to be considered as accomplished, due to some unsolved problems on the system I/O-card's output channels giving the motor controller card its reference voltage. A bike model and controller realized in Simulink was made by Bjermeland. Hence communicaton between Simulink and the device drivers had to be established, and this was realized by using S-functions and Real-Time Workshop. Finally the controller could be connected to the actual bike, but there was too little time left to explore this thoroughly, and make the system work properly. However, a foundation is laid for further development of the control strategy, hopefully storing a bright future for the CyberBike. </p...|$|E
40|$|In working environments {{with large}} manipulators, {{accidental}} collisions can cause severe personal injuries and can seriously damage manipulators, necessitating {{the development of}} an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> algorithm to prevent such occurrences. In this paper, we propose an <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> system for the efficient and safe operation of a manipulator by applying an intelligent <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> algorithm. Our proposed intelligent algorithm considers the direction of motion of the manipulator. In addition, using a new regression method, the algorithm includes a decision step that determines whether a detected object is a collision-causing obstacle or a part of the manipulator. We apply our <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> system to a two-link manipulator and assess the performance of our intelligent <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> algorithm as compared with other models...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1997 <b>Emergency</b> <b>stop</b> {{controls}} are essential parts of industrial machinery {{because they are}} designed to stop the operation in case of emergencies without risks to operators, equipment, products, or facilities. Current guidelines for <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> controls have been formulated based on experience but not on empirical studies. The main objectives of this research were {{to determine the effects of}} the type and orientation of <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons on the reaction time, mode of activation, and preferences of subjects in order to formulate guidelines for their selection. An experiment consisting of a simple, cooperative assembly operation with a Microbot was designed for this study. The main conclusions of this research are that reaction time to activate <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbutton is not affected by the orientation of the control but it is influenced by the type of control. The mode of activation of <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons is influenced by both the type and the orientation of the control. Subjects preferred <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons without guards or with half guards over controls with full guards, and subjects also preferred an inclined orientation of the control over horizontal or vertical orientations. The following guidelines are recommended for the selection of <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons. Select <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons without guards. If a guard is absolutely required, select a guard with slots or a half guard to ensure adequate visibility of and access to the button. If possible, give <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> pushbuttons an inclined orientation (about 45 °) on the control panel. Avoid using vertical orientations for these controls...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A motion planner of <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> {{must make}} an {{operating}} humanoid robot to a stationary state under the emergency signal. It {{plays an important}} role in prevention of falling over because humanoid robots fall over easily. Immedi-ately after the emergency signal, it must generate the <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> motion in real-time. We modeled a humanoid robot as a simple dynamic system consists of ZMP (Zero-Moment Point) and COG (Center of Gravity) as its states. The <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> motion is generated by a state feedback. We determined optimal feedback gains in terms of the initial conditions and the pole assignment. The proposed method realized a reliable <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> with low computational cost. Furthermore, it can easily predict the possibility of the successful <b>emergency</b> <b>stop</b> at any time. The validity of the proposed method is confirmed by an experiment using humanoid robot HRP- 2. I...|$|R
