5|$|Rule 90 is an {{elementary}} cellular automaton. That {{means that it}} consists of a one-dimensional array of cells, each of which holds a single binary value, either 0 or 1. An assignment of values {{to all of the}} cells is called a configuration. The automaton is given an <b>initial</b> <b>configuration,</b> and then progresses through other configurations in a sequence of discrete time steps. At each step, all cells are updated simultaneously. A pre-specified rule determines the new value of each cell as a function of its previous value and of the values in its two neighboring cells. All cells obey the same rule, which may be given either as a formula or as a rule table that specifies the new value for each possible combination of neighboring values.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: We compare folding {{trajectories of}} {{chymotrypsin}} inhibitor (CI 2) using a dynamic Monte Carlo scheme with Go-type potentials. The model considers the four back-bone atoms of each residue and a sphere centered around Cb {{the diameter of}} which is cho-sen according {{to the type of}} the side group. Bond lengths and bond angles are kept fixed. Folding trajectories are obtained by giving random increments to the u and w torsion angles with some bias toward the native state. Excluded volume effects are considered. Two sets of 20 trajectories are obtained, with different <b>initial</b> <b>configurations.</b> The first set is generated from random <b>initial</b> <b>configurations.</b> The <b>initial</b> <b>configurations</b> of the second set are generated according to knowledge-based neighbor dependent torsion probabilities derived from triplets in the Protein Data Bank.

40|$|AbstractAgents in a {{cellular}} grid have the task {{to move from}} their start positions to their individual target positions as fast as possible. Four models using agents are proposed {{that can be applied}} to the problem. These models are conform to the CA paradigm. The agents have either a moving direction (directed agent) or not (undirected agent). The agents behave either in a deterministic way according to a control automaton inside of each agent or they behave randomly. In order to find the best behaving agents, control automata (“algorithms”) were evolved using a genetic island model. Near optimal algorithms were evolved separately for k= 1 to k= 256 agents in a 32 × 32 environment using 20 random <b>initial</b> <b>configurations</b> for each k. Then these algorithms were ranked using another set of 100 <b>initial</b> <b>configurations</b> for each k. It turned out that the agents behave better with respect to speed and reliability in this order: (1) controlled directed agents, (2) random directed agents, (3) random undirected agents, and (4) controlled undirected agents. Although the controlled directed agents (optimized for each k) can solve all the given 100 <b>initial</b> <b>configurations</b> in the ranking set, it can not be assured that no deadlocks may occur for other <b>initial</b> <b>configurations...</b>|$|R

25|$|Soft tissues {{have the}} {{potential}} to undergo big deformations and still come back to the <b>initial</b> <b>configuration</b> when unloaded, i.e. their stress-strain curve is nonlinear. The soft tissues are also viscoelastic, incompressible and usually anisotropic. Some viscoelastic properties observable in soft tissues are: relaxation, creep and hysteresis. In order to describe the mechanical response of soft tissues, several methods have been used. These methods include: hyperelastic macroscopic models based on strain energy, mathematical fits where nonlinear constitutive equations are used, and structurally based models where the response of a linear elastic material is modified by its geometric characteristics.|$|E

Her hold was turned into an exhibition space and a cafeteria was opened in the crew mess.

25|$|Some {{aspects of}} brane physics {{have been applied}} to {{cosmology}}. For example, brane gas cosmology attempts to explain why there are three dimensions of space using topological and thermodynamic considerations. According to this idea it would be because three is {{the largest number of}} spatial dimensions where strings can generically intersect. If initially there are lots of windings of strings around compact dimensions, space could only expand to macroscopic sizes once these windings are eliminated, which requires oppositely wound strings to find each other and annihilate. But strings can only find each other to annihilate at a meaningful rate in three dimensions, so it follows that only three dimensions of space are allowed to grow large given this kind of <b>initial</b> <b>configuration.</b>|$|E
25|$|In Monte Carlo, an <b>initial</b> <b>configuration</b> {{is refined}} by taking random steps which are {{accepted}} or rejected {{based on their}} induced improvement in score (see the Metropolis criterion), until {{a certain number of}} steps have been tried. The assumption is that convergence to the best structure should occur from a large class of initial configurations, only one of which needs to be considered. Initial configurations may be sampled coarsely, and much computation time can be saved. Because of the difficulty of finding a scoring function which is both highly discriminating for the correct configuration and also converges to the correct configuration from a distance, the use of two levels of refinement, with different scoring functions, has been proposed. Torsion can be introduced naturally to Monte Carlo as an additional property of each random move.|$|E

500|$|A {{well-known}} {{classification of}} cellular automata by Stephen Wolfram studies their behavior on random initial conditions. For a reversible cellular automaton, if the <b>initial</b> <b>configuration</b> is chosen uniformly at random among all possible configurations, then that same uniform randomness {{continues to hold}} for all subsequent states. Thus {{it would appear that}} most reversible cellular automata are of Wolfram's Class 3: automata in which almost all initial configurations evolve pseudo-randomly or chaotically. However, it is still possible to distinguish among different reversible cellular automata by analyzing the effect of local perturbations on the behavior of the automaton. Making a change to the initial state of a reversible cellular automaton may cause changes to later states to remain only within a bounded region, to propagate irregularly but unboundedly, or to spread quickly, and [...] lists one-dimensional reversible cellular automaton rules exhibiting all three of these types of behavior.|$|E
500|$|From any <b>initial</b> <b>configuration</b> of Rule 90, one may form a {{mathematical}} forest, a {{directed acyclic graph}} in which every vertex has at most one outgoing edge, whose trees {{are the same as}} the trees in Miller's metaphor.

500|$|In the Sierpiński triangle, for any integer , {{the rows}} {{numbered}} by multiples of [...] have nonzero cells spaced at least [...] units apart.

This spacing is wide enough to prevent the copies from interfering with each other. The number of copies {{is the same as}} the number of nonzero cells in the corresponding row of the Sierpiński triangle. Thus, in this rule, every pattern is a replicator: it generates multiple copies of itself that spread out across the configuration, eventually filling the whole array. Other rules including the Von Neumann universal constructor, Codd's cellular automaton, and Langton's loops also have replicators that work by carrying and copying a sequence of instructions for building themselves. In contrast, the replication in Rule 90 is trivial and automatic.|$|E
