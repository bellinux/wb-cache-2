50|$|Hypnotics {{are often}} used to treat the {{symptoms}} of insomnia, or other sleep disorders. Benzodiazepines are still among the most widely prescribed sedative-hypnotics in the United States today. Certain non-benzodiazepine drugs are used as hypnotics as well. Although they lack the chemical structure of the benzodiazepines, their sedative effect is similarly through action on the GABAA receptor. They also have a reputation of being less addictive than benzodiazepines. Melatonin, a naturally-occurring hormone, is often used over the counter (OTC) to treat insomnia and jet lag. This hormone appears to be excreted by the pineal gland early during the sleep cycle and may contribute to human circadian rhythms. Because OTC melatonin supplements {{are not subject to}} careful and consistent manufacturing, more specific melatonin agonists are sometimes preferred. They are used for their action on melatonin receptors in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, responsible for sleep-wake cycles. Many barbiturates have or had an <b>FDA-approved</b> <b>indication</b> for use as sedative-hypnotics, but have become less widely used because of their limited safety margin in overdose, their potential for dependence, and the degree of central nervous system depression they induce. The amino-acid L-tryptophan is also available OTC, and seems to be free of dependence or abuse liability. However, it is not as powerful as the traditional hypnotics. Because of the possible role of serotonin in sleep patterns, a new generation of 5-HT2 antagonists are in current development as hypnotics.|$|R

40|$|Background: Premenstrual {{syndrome}} (PMS) {{is reported}} to affect between 13 % and 31 % of women. Between 3 % and 8 % of women are reported to meet criteria for the more severe form of PMS, premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Although PMDD has received increased attention in recent years, the cost effectiveness of treatments for PMDD remains unknown. Abstract: Objective: To evaluate the cost effectiveness of the four medications with a US <b>FDA-approved</b> <b>indication</b> for PMDD: fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine and drospirenone plus ethinyl estradiol (DRSP/EE). Abstract: Methods: A decision-analytic model {{was used to evaluate}} both direct costs (medication and physician visits) and clinical outcomes (treatment success, failure and discontinuation). Medication costs were based on average wholesale prices of branded products; physician visit costs were obtained from a claims database study of PMDD patients and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Clinical outcome probabilities were derived from published clinical trials in PMDD. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated using the difference in costs and percentage of successfully treated patients at 6 months. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used {{to assess the impact of}} uncertainty in parameter estimates. Threshold values where a change in the cost-effective strategy occurred were identified using a net benefit framework. Abstract: Results: Starting therapy with DRSP/EE dominated both sertraline and paroxetine, but not fluoxetine. The estimated ICER of initiating treatment with fluoxetine relative to DRSP/EE was $US 4385 per treatment success (year 2007 values). Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves revealed that for ceiling ratios ≥$US 3450 per treatment success, fluoxetine had the highest probability (≥ 0. 37) of being the most cost-effective treatment, relative to the other options. The cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier further indicated that DRSP/EE remained the option with the highest expected net monetary benefit for ceiling values ≤$US 3900 per treatment success. Abstract: Conclusion: These analyses suggest that initiating therapy with DRSP/EE may be a cost-effective option in the treatment of PMDD.

The FDA does not have the legal authority to regulate the practice of the medicine, and the physician may prescribe a drug off-label. Contrary to popular notion, it is legal in the United States and in many other countries to use drugs off-label, including controlled substances such as opiates. Actiq, for example, is commonly prescribed off-label even though it is a Schedule II controlled substance. While it would be legal for a physician to independently decide to prescribe a drug such as Actiq off-label, it is illegal for the company to promote off-label uses to prescribers. In fact, Cephalon, the maker of Actiq, was fined for illegal promotion of the drug in September 2008. Under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) at U.S.C. 21 §§301-97, manufacturers are prohibited from directly marketing a drug for a use other than the <b>FDA-approved</b> <b>indication.</b> However, in December 2012, the United States Second Circuit Court found that promotion of off-label uses by a company sales representative was considered to be protected speech per the First Amendment.

40|$|Atypical {{antipsychotic}} medications {{have assumed}} growing importance {{for the treatment of}} bipolar disorder, an illness that affects approximately 1. 2 %– 3. 7 % of the general population in a given year. Current practice guidelines for the treatment of bipolar mania support the use of atypical antipsychotic medications as monotherapy or as a component of polytherapy, and in clinical settings the use of atypical antipsychotics to treat bipolar disorder is widespread. Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic, sometimes referred to as a second-generation antipsychotic. The receptor-binding profile of risperidone, which includes potent antagonism of the serotonin 5 -HT 2 A, dopamine D 2, and alpha-adrenergic receptors, is believed to be related to positive effects on mood. The <b>FDA-approved</b> bipolar <b>indications</b> for risperidone include: 1) monotherapy for short-term treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and 2) combination therapy with lithium or valproate for the short-term treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. This review of risperidone for bipolar mania will address the chemistry, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of risperidone, use with concomitant medications, clinical trials in bipolar mania, as well as safety and tolerability issues. Finally, dosing and administration are addressed as well as use for bipolar mania in geriatric, child, or adolescent patients...|$|R
