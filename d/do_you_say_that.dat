In , Jesus blesses Peter for his answer, and states: [...] "flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father who is in heaven." [...] In blessing Peter, Jesus not only accepts the titles Christ and Son of God, which Peter attributes to him, but declares the proclamation a divine revelation by stating that his Father in Heaven had revealed it to Peter. In this assertion, by endorsing both titles as divine revelation, Jesus unequivocally declares himself to be both Christ and the Son of God.|$|E
