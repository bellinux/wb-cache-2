40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{real-time}} management of a delayed delivery vehicle. The vehicle's initial routing plan {{is modified to}} minimise the adverse impact of the delay by selecting the clients to serve and the clients for whom to <b>defer</b> <b>delivery.</b> This single vehicle re-planning problem is modelled based on the formulation of the well-known Orienteering Problem (OP). A novel approach is proposed to provide an efficient, near-optimal solution. This approach decomposes the problem into smaller sub-problems, {{taking advantage of the}} geographical distribution of clients into clusters (neighbourhoods and/or suburbs). The available vehicle time is distributed to each cluster by solving a non-linear optimisation problem. Within each cluster, an established OP heuristic is used to determine the clients to be served and the vehicle route. The proposed approach has been applied to large test cases, as well as to problem instances from actual distribution networks. The results indicate that in terms of solution quality the proposed method outperforms the methods used to solve the monolithic problem. Furthermore, the method is, in general, more efficient, especially in cases involving a large number of clients. Finally, computational times are short, indicating the suitability of the method for real-time applications. real time management; distribution networks; vehicle fleet re-planning; orienteering problem; supply chain optimisation; delivery vehicles; clustered clients routing plans...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{abolition}} of the gold monetary system, which was used in prior eras of Islamic civilization, along with the domination of forward products in the contemporary gold business sector, the majority of Muslims jurists still emphasize that to defer delivery of product or delay payments is highly prohibited in gold transactions. This study argues that in the contemporary world, where gold does not play any role as currency, there are credible views based on solid Islamic legal sources from Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn Qayyim that permit <b>deferred</b> <b>delivery</b> and delayed payment in gold business contracts. However, this is limited to gold matter that isn’t minted by a monetary authority for currency purposes. Thus, the main objective {{of this study is to}} discuss the modern forward gold contracts and gold futures and to discover how far these products are in harmony with Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn Qayyim’s views that permitted defer delivery and delay payment in noncurrency gold transactions. In order to achieve the goals of this study the researcher used the following methods: induction, comparative, and analysis approaches. In addition, a qualitative approach was used in order to conduct interviews to hear the views of fatwa issuers and shari’ah experts in the gold business sector. Moreover, the analysis of secondary data and interview responses indicates that gold and all of its derivatives (ore, coins, dīnār, jewellery, etc.) have been used by Muslims as one of the major currencies during the time of the Prophet (PBUH) and his companions (RDAN). However, it was found the role of gold as currency was confined to the dinar and Muslim scholars were divided in to different views about gold transactions. The majority view, known as the Jumhur, prohibited <b>deferred</b> <b>delivery</b> and delayed payment gold transactions. However, the minority view, held by Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn Qayyim, permitted it under certain circumstances. This study adopts the minority opinion in accordance with valid Islamic sources and contemporary realities. Finally it was suggested that more research is needed to determine the general prohibitions that Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn Qayyim’ views did not allow to be applied in modern forward gold transactions and gold future...|$|E

The idea is to analyze the dynamics of the network, and in particular to measure the delivery delay and its variation, which is directly related to out-of-order delivery. With these measures, receivers can determine a near-optimal latch time to <b>defer</b> message <b>delivery</b> upon the detection of a hole in the message sequence number.

The increasing number of prospective parents undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF) due to advanced reproductive age, however, reflects the discrepancy between socio-cultural development and physical limits. Assisted reproduction is, therefore, challenged to create and adapt treatment regimens for women of advanced reproductive age to bridge between this wish for late parenthood and the age-related decline in fecundity. Consequently, the knowledge concerning age-related changes of reproductive functions gains in importance. While follicular depletion and impaired oocyte quality, frequently also called diminished ovarian reserve, are generally acknowledged as the underlying mechanisms for the decline in maternal fecundity, the way to correctly assess the status of ovarian reserve has remained controversial. Besides increasing attempts to achieve conception, <b>deferring</b> pregnancy and <b>delivery</b> into older age also implies medical risks and ethical considerations. The use of IVF in older women, therefore, raises the issue of the utilization of preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in the assessment of embryonic aneuploidies, as well as in attempts to optimize pregnancy rates with IVF.

40|$|Abstract—Experimenting with {{mobile and}} {{wireless}} networks is challenging because testbeds lack repeatability and existing simulation models are unrealistic for real-world settings. We present practical {{models for the}} physical and MAC layer behavior in mobile wireless networks {{in order to address}} this challenge. Our models use measurements of a real network rather than abstract radio propagation and mobility models as the basis for accuracy in complex environments. We develop an adaptive measurement technique in order to maximize the accuracy of our models in dynamic environments. The models then predict the packet <b>delivery,</b> <b>deferring,</b> and collision probability in the same network for an arbitrary set of transmitters. This allows to explore the performance of different network and higher layer protocols in simulation or emulation under identical and realistic conditions. We evaluate the accuracy of our models empirically by comparing them to benchmark measurements. We find that our models are effective at reproducing mobile scenarios in various environments. Across many experiments in realistic environments, we are able to reproduce link delivery probabilities with RMS error below 12 percent, and the simulated throughput of data flows in the presence of interfering transmitters with an error that is below 10 percent.

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{work has}} {{addressed}} {{the existence of}} link burstiness {{and its effect on}} wireless communication as a local phenomenon. To achieve better end-to-end delay performance in a mission-critical application of wireless sensor networks, such as the infrastructure surveillance system, the routing faces three issues: whether this link burstiness has any mutual impact with other delay factors (such as the local minima and the cycle waiting time) to <b>defer</b> the message <b>delivery,</b> whether a transmission that failed because of the link burstiness is worthy to retry compared with other possible paths in terms of the end-to-end delay performance, how the number of retransmission is determined so that the delay cost can be calculated for the use of an alternative path. In this paper, we provide a fully distributed solution with a new measurement. First, each node prepares a 4 -tuple matric for any path passing through. The larger the value is, the faster the routing will be to reach the nearest destination sink. Then, our routing uses this reference information to select a relatively better successor candidate for each 1 -hop advance. Even though many unexpected changes of link quality or node availability occur in the networks, our routing is still effective and can approach the destination in a local greedy manner. As a result, the cost and the impact of inconsistency in the existing information models can be mitigated to the minimum. Our analytical and experimental results show the effectiveness of this approach in reducing the end-to-end delay...|$|R
