5000|$|Both Kurtzman and Feldstein {{wanted the}} {{magazine}} to solicit advertising, feeling {{this could be}} accomplished without compromising Mads content or editorial independence. Kurtzman remembered Ballyhoo, a boisterous 1930s humor publication that made an editorial point of mocking its own sponsors. Feldstein {{went so far as}} to propose an in-house Mad ad agency, and produced a [...] "dummy" [...] copy of what an issue with ads could look like. But Bill Gaines was intractable, telling the television news magazine 60 Minutes, [...] "We long ago decided we couldnt take money from Pepsi-Cola and make fun of Coca-Cola." [...] Gaines motivation in eschewing ad dollars was less philosophical than practical: Wed have to improve our package. Most advertisers want to appear in a magazine thats loaded with color and has super-slick paper. So you find yourself being pushed into producing a more expensive package. You get bigger and fancier and attract more advertisers. Then you find youre losing some of your advertisers. Your readers still expect the <b>fancy</b> <b>package,</b> so you keep putting it out, but now you dont have your advertising income, which is why you got fancier in the first place—and now youre sunk.|$|E
50|$|Some while ago, {{when buying}} tea leaves at tea houses, the staff {{would take the}} tea leaves out of a large, foil container, weigh it and then pack it with papers and a plastic bag. This kind of {{packaging}} was not considered very attractive and it would negatively {{affect the quality of}} the tea leaves as they would oxidise quickly, thereby losing their aroma. The packaging of tea leaves has greatly improved since then. Now tea leaves are vacuum-packed in high density plastic packs with <b>fancy</b> <b>packaging.</b> Not only is the quality raised, but the market value of the tea is also increased.|$|R
50|$|Examples of {{the power}} of the mind over pain, anxiety and {{depression}} are presented with studies showing how higher prices, <b>fancy</b> <b>packaging,</b> theatrical procedures and a confident attitude in the doctor all contribute to the relief of symptoms. In patients with no specific diagnosed condition, even a fake diagnosis and prognosis with no other treatment helps recovery, but ethical and time constraints usually prevent doctors from giving this reassurance. Exploiting the placebo effect is presented as possibly justifiable if used in conjunction with effective conventional treatments. The author links its use by alternative medicine practitioners with the diversion of patients away from effective treatments and the undermining of public health campaigns on AIDS and malaria.|$|R
5000|$|Sports energy gels {{emerged in}} the United Kingdom in 1986 as a [...] "convenient, prewrapped, portable" [...] way to deliver {{carbohydrates}} during endurance events. Gels have a gooey texture and are {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "goo" [...] generically. The gel Leppin Squeezy was distributed at the Hawaii Ironman Triathlon in 1988. Once considered a [...] "cult product in clear packaging", energy gel products are now marketed in <b>fancy</b> <b>packaging</b> and {{come in a variety of}} flavors. The energy gel market grew during the 1990s, as professional athletes began endorsing products. Manufacturers generally encourage the consumption of multiple packets, with water, when participating in endurance events. Individual packets typically cost between 99 cents and $1.29 (as reported by the St. Petersburg Times in 2003).|$|R
5000|$|... 1995 - Release of {{the first}} Shadowfist 'Limited' set. Consisted of {{randomly}} packed 60-card starter decks and 13-card booster packs. This set was printed by Upper Deck and boosters have <b>fancy</b> foil <b>packaging.</b> Included the original five factions: Architects, Ascended, Dragons, Hand, and Lotus, and a few cards from the Four Monarchs and Jammers. These cards bear a gold foil Ting Ting (a popular card from the Dragons faction) logo in the upper right hand corner.|$|R
50|$|From reserving a full {{train in}} the 1930s, the Kundus took to reserving entire bogies (train compartments) in the 1960s. They would carry {{mattresses}} known as “Dunlopillos” to fit within the train sleeping berths for comfort. Instead of checking into hotels (there weren’t that many quality ones in those days), the tourists would stay on in the bogie that would be stationed on the side tracks, somewhere in a railway station in India. The mornings would start with hot ghee-soaked luchis and dhonkar dalna along with a steaming cup of tea (luchi, a kind of fried puffed bread is a very popular Bengali delicacy). That would lead to khichudi-begun bhaja or bhaat-maacher jhol in the afternoon. At night, meat was a staple component of the meal unless of course the tour {{was one of the}} pilgrimages where vegetarian fare was de rigueur. A frequent traveller on Kundu Special was heard saying, Aar ki chai Dada, sakal-e luchi, raat-e luchi, e-to bari-teo hoy na! (What more do you want, luchi in the morning, luchi in the evening, we don't even get this at home.) The khichudi may have given way to fried rice in the 80s and to chow mein and biryani in the 21st Century, and the stationed bogie to hotel rooms, but even in the days of Cox and Kings and <b>fancy</b> <b>packages</b> and low-cost airfares, Kundu Special holds its own as a traditional Bengali bastion.|$|R
5000|$|Reader Rabbit was {{originally}} conceived by the Grimm sisters and titled Reader Rabbit and the Fabulous Word Factory. It {{was released in}} late 1983 or early 1984 (and featured in the 1983 holiday special for The Computer Chronicles''''), with later versions released in 1984. In 1986, both Reader Rabbit 2.0 and Math Rabbit were released, while 1987 saw the release of Writer Rabbit, {{with the intention of}} having a Rabbit series that featured different academic subjects; however, the title soon became locked in as Reader Rabbit, and under that name, the developers explored subjects beyond reading. (Math Rabbit would later be renamed to Reader Rabbit Math). Many critics and gaming historians erroneously assert that the Reader Rabbit series officially began in 1986. The 1990s saw an audio cassette release of some of the game's most popular music, entitled Reader Rabbit's Sing Along Favorites In 1995, The Learning Company was bought by Softkey after it made a hostile takeover bid, with the latter company adopting the former company's name. This saw the series go into a new direction, which involved cutting R&D costs, downsizing staff, re-releasing older software with a minimal redesign, and selling cheaper software. The Platinum line of budget titles pushed the retail price for edutainment down to $12.99 and swapped the <b>fancy</b> <b>packaging</b> for a simple jewel case. At this time, SoftKey founder Kevin O'Leary recalled [...] "I’d get a $US12 million order for [...] "Reader Rabbit," [...] it would blow up behind me, the logistics. I couldn’t deliver", noting that he gave Mike Perik half his equity to solve the problem.|$|R
30|$|The International Coalition for Responsible Tourism {{associated}} responsible tourism {{with the}} concept of sustainability, qualifying responsible tourism as an application of sustainable development within the tourism sector (UNEP 2005). The Responsible Travel Handbook states that responsible tourism goes beyond <b>fancy</b> <b>packaging</b> and eco-certification, or simplistic internal hotel policies of washing sheets and towels, or accommodations located in natural jungle. Rather {{it has to do with}} an everyday lifestyle that promotes cultural and biological diversity, environmental and natural resources conservation, at home and while travelling (see: Responsible Travel Handbook 2006 : 13). This definition has been further developed (Second International Conference on Responsible Tourism Destinations held in Kerala in 2008) through guidelines and recommendations for actions in different fields (education, training, campaigning and awareness raising, media, governance, partnerships and markets) in order to promote it. Responsible tourism takes a variety of forms of travels that minimize negative environmental, social and cultural impacts, generate greater economic benefits for local people and enhances the well being of host communities, involve local people in decisions, make positive contribution to the conservation and valorization of natural and cultural heritage, provide access for physically challenged people and enjoyable experiences for tourists through meaningful connections with local people and a greater understanding of local cultural and environmental issues, and engender respect between tourists and hosts (Cape Town Declaration 2002). Therefore responsible tourism can be considered a sort of umbrella, which includes all types of tourism afore mentioned, included the fair-trade tourism, solidarity tourism, community based tourism, rural tourism, agro-tourism, heritage tourism, reality tourism, pro-poor tourism and conscientious tourism. “Responsible tourism is a broad concept that includes different conscious and respectful ways of travelling, which bring people to take responsibility for their actions while sustainable tourism represents the natural reply that tourist operators give in order to fulfill the needs and wishes of responsible tourists” (Manente et al. 2014 : 12).|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} {{biochemical}} systems modeling and analysis {{is faced with}} an unprecedented flood of data from experimental methodologies of molecular biology. While these techniques continue to leapfrog ahead in the speed, volume and finesse with which they generate data, the methods of data analysis and interpretation, however, are still playing the catch-up game. The notions of systems analysis have found a new foothold, {{under the banner of}} Systems Biology, with the promise of uncovering the rationale for the designs of biological systems from their parts lists, as they are generated by experimentation and sorted and managed by bioinformatics tools. With an aim to complement hypothesis-driven and reductionistic biological research, and not replace it, a systems biologist relies on the tools of mathematical and computational modeling to be able to contribute meaningfully to any ongoing bio-molecular systems research. These systems analysis tools, however, should not only have their roots steeped well in the theoretical foundations of biochemistry, mathematics and numerical computation, but they should be married to a framework that facilitates the required systems way of thought for all its users computational scientists, experimentalists and molecular biologists alike. Hopefully, such framework-based tools would go beyond just providing <b>fancy</b> GUIs, numerical <b>packages</b> for integrating ODEs and/or optimization libraries. The intent of this thesis is to present a framework and toolbox for biochemical systems modeling, with an application in metabolic pathway analysis and/or metabolic engineering. The research presented here builds upon the tenets of a very well established and generic approach to biological systems modeling and analysis, called Biochemical Systems Theory (BST), which is almost forty years old. The nuances of modeling and practical hurdles to analysis are presented {{in the context of a}} real-time case study of analyzing the glucolytic pathway in the bacterium Lactococcus lactis. Alongside, the thesis presents the features of a MATLAB-based software application that has been built upon the framework of BST and is aptly named as Biochemical Systems Toolbox (BSTBox). The thesis presents novel contributions, made by the author during the course of his research, to state-of-the-art techniques in parameter estimation, and robustness and sensitivity analysis topics that, as this thesis will show, remain to be the most restrictive bottlenecks in the world of biological systems modeling and analysis.
