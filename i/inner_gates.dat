5|$|The {{entrance}} {{gates and}} wall separating the gardens {{from the park}} and farmland date from 1878 and are listed at grade II. The wrought-iron gates are by Cubitt & Co., and were exhibited at the Paris Exhibition of 1878. Two outer single gates and a double inner gate are supported by four sandstone piers. The outer pair of gate piers are capped by a bud-shaped device supported on scrolls; the inner pair are surmounted by a griffin and a lion, mirroring the statuary of the hall's terraces. The lower gate sections of lyre-like panels with leaf and spearhead motifs are topped with Jacobean-style arched panels. The ornate gate overthrows include shields and emblems capped with crowns, sheaves and sickles. The <b>inner</b> <b>gates</b> bear the inscription Quid retribuam domino ("What can I render to the Lord?"), while the outer gates bear the date. The wall, of brick with stone dressings, features arcading and has piers surmounted with ogee caps carved to match the tiles of the main hall tower. A further feature of the gardens to survive is a grade-II-listed sundial dating from the early 19th century, which stands {{to the rear of}} the house.|$|E
25|$|As the fog lifted, Oppen {{gave the}} order for all columns to attack at 11:00 am. Shortly before this time four battalions of Thümen's brigade arrived and were used to {{reinforce}} the attacking columns. The first assault against the entrenched camp failed, but a second charge drove Marie's four battalions back into the city. Because Charpentier was unable to grasp where the Prussians were attacking, the French reaction was slow and ineffective. One Prussian column rapidly seized the Velp gate which was defended by a few soldiers. Colomb's horse artillery blew open the Sabelpoort gate while the Jans gate also fell quickly. The three Prussian eastern columns burst into the city and rushed {{one of the two}} <b>inner</b> <b>gates.</b> These easy seizures were the result of Charpentier concentrating most of his troops on the western side of the city.|$|E
2500|$|Flood locks {{which have}} been used only as flood gates (see below) are often {{incapable}} of reverting to their former purpose without refurbishment. That is, where only outer gates are ever closed (probably because a waterway is not a true commercial one, and therefore there is no financial imperative for a boat to venture out onto a flooded river) <b>inner</b> <b>gates</b> soon suffer from lack of maintenance. A good example is on the Calder and Hebble Navigation, where structures {{referred to in the}} boating guides as [...] "Flood Locks" [...] are clearly only capable of being used for flood-prevention, not for [...] "penning" [...] boats to or from the river in flood.|$|E

60|$|Two more {{gateways}} let {{into the}} great fortress, one piercing the north wall and one the east. All three gates were strongly fortified with towered and buttressed barbicans which must be taken before the main gates could be reached. Each barbican was portcullised, while the <b>inner</b> <b>gates</b> were similarly safeguarded {{in addition to the}} drawbridges which, spanning the moat when lowered, could be drawn up at the approach of an enemy, effectually stopping his advance.|$|E
60|$|These {{were opened}} by a cheerful looking little man who wore green {{spectacles}} over his eyes.

60|$|At {{last the}} storm burst, {{for on the}} fifth morning after Elissa had barred herself within the tomb, Ithobal {{attacked}} the native town. Uttering their wild battle-cries, {{tens of thousands of}} his savage warriors, armed with great spears and shields of ox-hide, and wearing crests of plumes upon their heads, charged down upon the outer wall. Twice they were driven back, but the work was in bad repair and too long to defend, so that at the third rush they flowed over it like lines of marching ants, driving its defenders before them to the <b>inner</b> <b>gates.</b> In this battle some were killed, but the most of the slaves threw down their arms and went over to Ithobal, who spared them, together with their wives and children.|$|E

The short ladders are to enable us to cross a cut twenty feet deep they have made through the rock; when we get over this we can plant the long ladder against the wall. As soon as we gain the top every man must lie down and crawl along over those who have preceded him. If we are seen before a few of us are {{on the top of the}} wall we shall fail, because they will have time to give the alarm, and shut the <b>inner</b> <b>gates.</b>|$|E

The Inner Holsten Tor was connected to the dwelling of the tollkeeper, who guarded the access to the city at this location.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} novel {{cylindrical}} double gate In 0. 53 Ga 0. 47 As vertical Nanowire n type device, {{which offers a}} higher drive current, better channel potential controllability and reduced short channel effects at ultra-short channel length 14 nm through numerical simulation approach. An independent <b>inner</b> <b>gate</b> control is used for threshold voltage tuning. Improvement of drive current in the Double-Gate Vertical Nanowire Transistor (DG-VNWT) structure is achieved by growing the In 0. 53 Ga 0. 47 As Nanowire vertically on silicon substrate. Further to reduce the leakage current of the structure, we propose high-k LaAlO 3 outer gate stack in integration with Al 2 O 3 passivation layer and WN metal gate for the first time. Variable threshold voltage tuning is also achieved by <b>inner</b> <b>gate</b> control of the proposed device. An analytical model is built for validating threshold voltage dependence on <b>inner</b> <b>gate</b> voltage. Our results of the analytical model are observed to be at par with TCAD simulations. The proposed DG-VNWT device is compatible with silicon and high-k/metal gate CMOS technology with the unique capability of <b>inner</b> and outer <b>gate</b> control, the most promising scalable candidate for low power applications...|$|R
