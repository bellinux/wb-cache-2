40|$|In {{determining}} whether parties have {{entered into a}} simulated transaction, it is accepted legal practice to apply the principles encapsulated in the Doctrine. It is trite that the Doctrine attributes certain consequences to a transaction, namely such consequences as the parties actually intend, rather than the consequences that the parties simulate or intend to simulate. This test is applied irrespective of what the parties purpose for entering into that transaction is, however, purpose may be {{regarded as one of}} several factors in determining what such parties true intention is. In the recent case of Commissioner for the South African Revenue Service v NWK Ltd 2011 (2) SA 67 (SCA), the SCA seemingly revised the test to determine simulated transactions by stating that when considering simulation, one cannot simply have regard to whether the parties had an intention to give effect to the contract in accordance with its terms, but instead, one should further regard whether the transaction lacks commercial sense. This approach is spectacularly different from the traditional approach followed {{in a long line of}} cases decided before the NWK case. Consequently, this judgment resulted in great deal of uncertainty as regards the application of the Doctrine. This study investigates the disturbance caused by the SCA s judgement in the NWK Case and sought to determine whether the <b>judgment</b> <b>revised</b> the established principles forming part of the Doctrine. Having considered the judgments handed down in the Bosch and Roshcon cases, the view is that there are no deviations from the established principles and indeed an enquiry as to simulation will place emphasis on the manner in which the parties to a transaction intend to implement such transaction.

This research was a research and development (R & D) study. The subjects of the research were the students of XI Accounting 1 and 2, in the academic year of 2010 / 2011. The steps of the research were conducting needs analysis, writing the course grid and designing the units, writing the materials, consulting the materials to the supervisors as the expert <b>judgment,</b> <b>revising</b> the first draft, trying-out the second draft, evaluating and revising the materials, and writing the materials for the final draft. The data were collected using questionnaires, interview and observation techniques. There were two types of the collected data: 1) quantitative data, which were the results of the questionnaires, and 2) qualitative data, which were the results of the interview and observation. Those data were analyzed using quantitative data analysis by measuring the percentage and the mean values, and using descriptive qualitative data analysis by coding and categorizing. The research findings suggest some parts in a unit: title, objectives, lead-in (Let’s Get Ready), main activities (Let’s Listen and Speak and Let’s Read and Write sections), evaluation (Let’s Evaluate), reflection, summary (Let’s Summarize), and vocabulary list. They also show that each unit has got two cycles; spoken and written cycles. In the cycles, appropriate English learning materials indicate tasks divided in lead-in, main activities, and evaluation. The materials provide language functions, pronunciation and grammar lessons and vocabulary items. The appropriate materials are supported by the effectiveness of task components; goal, input, activity, teacher role, learners’ role and setting. The appropriate goals of the tasks are making students to have communicative, affective and cognitive learning outcomes. Pictures, dialogues, vocabulary and pronunciation lists, expressions, short explanations, letters, situations, invitation cards, memos, and articles are the appropriate inputs. The appropriate activities are pronouncing words, listening dialogues, answering questions, making and acting out dialogues, and reading letter, completing sentences, answering questions, finding synonyms, matching words, changing sentences, writing invitation cards and memo, and writing main ideas. Teacher’s roles are as a source, controller, assessor, feedback, prompter/guide, corrector, facilitator and observer. The learners’ roles are being active learners, passive recipients, performer, and listener. Individual and pair work in the classroom are the appropriate settings in this researc...|$|R

In contrast, information presented in the challenge receives a greater weight under a comparative challenge than under a noncomparative challenge. Interestingly, when presented in a comparative format, the information contained in the challenge received a relatively disproportionate weight even when the attributes presented in the challenge were less important than those on which the prior target evaluations were based. Results from Experiment 4 suggest that, under certain conditions, even a noncomparative challenge from a superior competitor can provide strong comparison opportunity and thus cause greater revisions in the prior evaluations of the target. Specifically, a greater elaboration of the initial target information and a high degree of commensurability between the target and competitor information jointly promote comparison opportunity and thus cause greater revisions of the prior target judgments. Our findings offer important extensions to previous research on the effects of amount and elaboration of prior target information on subsequent judgment revision. (C) 1999 Academic Press...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{propose a}} model of {{judgment}} revision, which posits that counterattitudinal challenges to a brand initially trigger a memory search for proattitudinal information about the brand. The proattitudinal information accessible from memory is then aligned with information contained in the challenge {{in order to assess}} the diagnosticity of the challenge, that is, how much it "damages" the retrieved brand information. If the challenge is not perceived to be diagnostic, the retrieved brand information is used to defend the previous attitudinal position. If the challenge is perceived to be diagnostic, <b>judgments</b> are <b>revised</b> in direct proportion to the amount of damage identified in the alignment phase. Four experiments test the model's predictions about the influence of abstract versus attribute-specific brand positioning on judgment revision. Consistent with the model's predictions, results show that compared with attribute-specific positioning, abstract positioning will result in less judgment revision when the challenge is specific (e. g., a direct attack about particular attributes of the brand) and the initial brand evaluation is based on limited learning of the positioning information. When the challenge is general (e. g., a blanket, unspecific negative statement about the brand), abstract positioning will result in greater judgment revision than attribute-specific positioning will. The differential effectiveness of abstract versus attribute-specific positioning is mediated by (1) the accessibility in memory of the positioning information {{at the time of the}} challenge and (2) the perceived diagnosticity of the challenge after alignment with the retrieved brand information...|$|R

The first approach analyses the dimensions of well-being separately. The inequality {{of each of these}} dimensions shows a remarkably different pattern over time. Unfortunately, this dimension-by-dimension approach is insensitive to the correlation between the dimensions of well-being.

40|$|Objectives:  The {{objectives}} were {{to conduct a}} comprehensive, systematic {{review of the literature}} for risk adjustment measures (RAMs) and outcome measures (OMs) for prehospital trauma research and to use a structured expert panel process to recommend measures for use in future emergency medical services (EMS) trauma outcomes research. Methods:  A systematic literature search and review was performed identifying the published studies evaluating RAMs and OMs for prehospital injury research. An explicit structured review of all articles pertaining to each measure was conducted using the previously established methodology developed by the Canadian Physiotherapy Association (“Physical Rehabilitation Outcome Measures”). Results:  Among the 4, 885 articles reviewed, 96 RAMs and/or OMs were identified from the existing literature (January 1958 to February 2010). Only one measure, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), currently meets Level 1 quality of evidence status and a Category 1 (strong) recommendation for use in EMS trauma research. Twelve RAMs or OMs received Category 2 status (promising, but not sufficient current evidence to strongly recommend), including the motor component of GCS, simplified motor score (SMS), the simplified verbal score (SVS), the revised trauma score (RTS), the prehospital index (PHI), EMS provider <b>judgment,</b> the <b>revised</b> trauma index (RTI), the rapid acute physiology score (RAPS), the rapid emergency medicine score (REMS), the field trauma triage (FTT), the pediatric triage rule, and the out‐of‐hospital decision rule for pediatrics. Conclusions:  Using a previously published process, a structured literature review, and consensus expert panel opinion, only the GCS can currently be firmly recommended as a specific RAM or OM for prehospital trauma research (along with core measures that have already been established and published). This effort highlights the paucity of reliable, validated RAMs and OMs currently available for outcomes research in the prehospital setting and hopefully will encourage additional, methodologically sound evaluations of the promising, Category 2 RAMs and OMs, as well as the development of new measures...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} how the code {{for the design of}} pile foundations in Shanghai, China is revised based on the reliability theory. With quality static load test data, both within-site and cross-site variabilities for design methods of piles in Shanghai are characterized. It is found that the amount of uncertainties associated with the design of piles in Shanghai is less than the typical values reported in the literature. With the partial factors specified in the previous design code, the reliability indexes of piles designed with empirical methods are in the range of 3. 08 – 4. 64, while those of piles designed with the load test-based method are in the range of 5. 67 – 5. 89. The load factors in the revised local design code have been reduced according to the national design code. As a result, the resistance factors have been increased in the revised code based on a combination of a reliability analysis and engineering <b>judgment.</b> In the <b>revised</b> design code, the reliability level of piles designed with the empirical methods is similar to that in the previous design code; the reliability level of piles designed with the load test-based method is lowered to achieve cost-effectiveness.

This is a Research and Development (R&D) research study. The subjects of the research were the students of class X PMIIA 3 of SMA N 2 Yogyakarta in the academic year of 2014 / 2015. Two types of questionnaires were used in {{this research}}. The first was a needs analysis questionnaire distributed to the students to identify their target and learning needs. The second questionnaire was an expert judgment questionnaire adapted from Instrumen Penilaian Buku Bahasa Inggris SMA to assess the appropriateness of the developed materials. The research procedure adapted the Jolly and Bolithos’s model in Tomlinson (1998). The steps of the research were conducting a needs analysis, writing the course grid, developing the materials, doing expert <b>judgment</b> and <b>revising</b> the materials. The data of the needs analysis were analyzed quantitatively using frequency and percentage, and then the results were used as the basis to develop the course grid. The course grid was used as the guideline to develop the tasks of the first draft of the learning materials. The first draft was evaluated by a materials evaluator. The results of the materials evaluation were analyzed through descriptive statistics and used to revise the first draft of the materials. This study developed three units of inquiry-based learning materials. Each unit covers all the four skills and consists of introduction, main lesson and reinforcement tasks ranging from 28 to 32 tasks. The input was in the form of spoken and written texts, vocabulary list and grammar explanation. The students are encouraged to do discussion and involve in active investigation to solve and do tasks.

Specifically, based on a real story about a man who died after hernia surgery, we investigated the extent to which participants <b>revised</b> their liability <b>judgment</b> about the medical staff for not having used heparin, based first on ambiguous numerical information (relative risk reduction: 50 %) and then on unambiguous numerical information (absolute risk reduction), that was framed either in terms of survival (e. g., 999 vs. 998 out of 1, 000 patients survived) or mortality (1 vs. 2 out of 1, 000 patients died), and presented as either resulting from small (1, 000) or large (10, 000) sample size groups. Method: Participants (N = 160) were students (aged 19 to 45, M = 22. 07, SD = 3. 60) who volunteered {{to take part in the}} experiment. Perceived liability and perceived risk reduction were measured on 7 -point scales. Result: When presented with relative risk information, participants judged the medical staff as more liable (M = 4. 84, SE =. 10) than when presented with absolute risk information (M = 4. 22, SE =. 11, F(1, 156) = 48. 47, p =. 0001, hp 2 =. 24). The change in judged liability depended both on frame and on sample size, which did not interact: Participants’ rated the liability higher in the mortality condition (M = 4. 76, SE =. 13) than in the survival frame condition (M = 4. 31, SE =. 13) F(1, 156) = 5. 61, p =. 02, hp 2 =. 04 (and post-hoc analyses showed that the <b>judgment</b> was <b>revised</b> only in the survival condition), and participants’ ratings were lower in the small- 1, 000 size condition (M = 4. 34, SE =. 13) than in the large- 10, 000 size condition (M = 4. 72, SE =. 13) F(1, 156) = 3. 89, p =. 05, hp 2 =. 02. Participants’ estimates of perceived risk reduction were also affected both by the frame and the sample size as for liability. The results of mediational analyses were consistent with the hypothesis that perceived risk reduction plays a mediational role between the frame of information and the judgment of liability. Conclusion: Even when provided with unambiguous numerical information, people seem to be affected by the way in which it is framed, and the frame affects liability judgment through the perceived risk reduction...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aimed to: (1) {{find out}} the students’ needs of Grade VII SMP/MTs in terms of reading comprehension in learning English and (2) develop the appropriate English learning materials using a theme-based storybook for reading comprehension of the “When English Rings A Bell” textbook for Grade VII of SMP/MTs. This was a research and development (R & D) study. The subjects were the students of SMP Negeri 15 Yogyakarta Classes VII-E and VII-F. The procedure was adapted from Smaldino, Lowther, and Russel (2012), which was called the ASSURE Model. The steps were conducting needs analysis, selecting and utilizing materials for developing the course grid, writing {{the first draft of}} the materials, evaluating the materials through the expert <b>judgment,</b> and <b>revising</b> it under suggestions and feedback obtained from the evaluation. Needs analysis questionnaires were employed as the instruments for collecting data. The data obtained from the needs analysis and the evaluation were analysed quantitatively using frequency and percentage and descriptively through the descriptive statistics respectively. The research findings revealed that: (1) they learned English to be able to comprehend and use English properly both orally and in writing for daily life; (2) regarding reading, their goal was to be able to comprehend English texts; (3) they found it difficult to comprehend English texts {{due to the lack of}} vocabulary mastery; (4) they wanted to have reading texts featured with supporting pictures to help their understanding of the texts; (5) they wanted to have a storybook with various interesting stories as the learning input; (6) they expected to have reading materials of which the themes were daily life and hobbies; (7) they preferred to do group discussions in learning; and (8) the teacher should discuss together the materials given to support the students’ comprehension. Afterwards, the course grid was developed. The materials were developed into three units. Although each unit has different numbers of tasks, it follows the unit design of which the components are: (1) introduction (Unit Title, Learning Objectives, Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3); (2) main lesson (Task 4, Task 5, Task 6, Task 7, Task 8, Task 9, Task 10, Task 11, Task 12, and Task 13); and (3) reinforcement (Homework, Evaluation, Reflection, The Fun Corner, and Vocabulary). Further, the results of the expert judgment showed that the developed materials were appropriate in terms of the content, language, presentation, and layout. The mean score of all aspects was 3. 63 which was categorized as “very good” as it is in the range of 3. 25 ≤ x ≤ 4...|$|R
40|$|Human culture {{relies on}} {{extensive}} use of social transmission, which must be integrated with independently acquired (i. e. asocial) information for effective decision-making. Formal evolutionary theory predicts that natural selection should favor adaptive learning strategies, including a bias to copy when uncertain, and a bias to disproportionately copy the majority (known as conformist transmission'). Although the function and causation of these evolved strategies has been comparatively well studied, little is known of their development. We experimentally investigated {{the development of the}} bias to copy-when-uncertain and conformist transmission in children from the ages of 3 to 7, testing predictions derived from theoretical models. Children first attempted to solve a binary-choice quantity discrimination task themselves using asocial information, but were then given the decisions of informants, and an opportunity to revise their answer. We investigated whether children's <b>revised</b> <b>judgments</b> were adaptively contingent on (i) the difficulty of the trial and (ii) the degree of consensus amongst informants. As predicted, older but not younger children copied others more on more difficult trials than on easier trials, even though older children also showed a tendency to stick with their initial, asocial decision. We also found that older children, like adults, were disproportionately receptive to non-total majorities (i. e. were conformist) whereas younger children were receptive only to total (i. e. unanimous) majorities. We conclude that, whilst the mechanism for incorporating social information into decision-making is initially very blunt, across the course of early childhood it converges on the adaptive learning mechanisms observed in adults and predicted by cultural evolutionary theory.

50|$|On 14 August 1899 Mr. Labori was {{the victim}} of an attack on his way to court. He was shot in the back by an extremist who escaped and was never found. The lawyer was missing from discussions for over a week at the decisive moment of the {{examination}} of witnesses. On 22 August 1899 his condition had improved and he returned. Incidents between the two lawyers for Dreyfus multiplied. Labori reproached Demange about his excessive caution. The Government {{in the face of the}} military hardening of the trial could still have two ways to influence events: call for testimony from Germany or abandon the charge. These negotiations in the background, however, had no result. The German Embassy sent a polite refusal to the government. The Minister of War, General Gaston de Galliffet, sent respectful word to Major Louis Carrière, the government commissioner. He asked him to remain in the spirit of the <b>revised</b> <b>judgment</b> of the Supreme Court. The officer pretended not to understand the allusion and helped the nationalist lawyer Auffray to make the indictment against Dreyfus. The defence needed to make a decision because the outcome of the case looked bad despite evidence of the absence of charges against the accused. On behalf of the President of the Council, Waldeck-Rousseau aided by Zola and Jaurès, Mr. Labori was convinced to give up his argument so as not to offend the military. They decided to risk conciliation in exchange for the acquittal that seemed to be promised by the government. Mr. Demange, alone and without illusions, continued the defence of Dreyfus in an atmosphere of civil war. In Paris the anti-semitic and nationalist agitators of Auteuil were arrested. Jules Guérin and those who fled and holed up in Fort Chabrol were assaulted by the police.|$|R
40|$|Advice taking {{constitutes}} {{a strategy to}} increase judgment accuracy that builds on existing ecological structures. Specifically, averaging the own judgment with that of others yields an increase in expected accuracy. Moreover, many decision situations are inherently interactive, thereby offering the opportunity to acquire advice before producing a final judgment. Theoretically, advice taking is thus highly adaptive. However, research on advice taking hinges on three core problems: the uncertain adaptivity of advice taking behavior; {{the lack of a}} unifying theoretical framework; and the conceptual constraints of existing research. First, whereas averaging the own judgment and the advice yields highest expected accuracy, individuals often place a relatively low weight on the advice during judgment revision. Second, there is no theoretical framework to integrate the many determinants of advice taking already identified. Third, advice taking research almost exclusively focused on the weighting of advice once it is received, thereby neglecting information search. The current thesis addresses these three problems from an ecological perspective. This perspective assumes that the interactive nature of advice taking affords the individual with the opportunity to seek additional information. Specifically, advice taking is conceptualized as a sequential process that can be truncated at different points in time, for example after consulting different amounts of advice. To this end, the current thesis introduces an expanded advice taking paradigm that allows individuals to sample any number of other people’s <b>judgments</b> before <b>revising</b> their own. The current thesis proposes an information integration account of advice taking that expands existing theoretical ideas, incorporates information search and integrates the most important determinants of advice taking as identified by existing research. The adaptivity of advice taking is re-evaluated from this ecological perspective. A simulation assesses which integration strategy fares best in an environment that accords to the ecological perspective advocated in this thesis. Experiments investigate whether individuals explore and adapt to the information ecology when given the opportunity. The results suggest that advice taking is much more adaptive than previously documented. Placing a low weight on the advice yields higher accuracy than weighting the own judgment and the advice equally when advice taking is a sequential process with several steps of updating. Moreover, individuals explore and adapt to the information ecology when given the opportunity. The experimental data also support the proposed theoretical framework of advice taking. This thesis provides strong evidence that the ecological nature of advice taking can no longer be neglected by advice taking research. Further discrepancies between advice taking in the laboratory and advice taking in the wild, necessary steps to further validate the proposed theoretical account, and future directions to investigating the adaptivity of advice taking are discussed.

40|$|The aims of {{the study}} are: to {{identify}} the target needs of the students of the third semester students of hotel accommodation department at STP AMPTA; to identify the learning needs of the students of the third semester students of hotel accommodation department at STP AMPTA; and to develop the appropriate speaking materials for the students of the third semester students of hotel accommodation department at STP AMPTA. This is a Research and Development (R&D) study. This study adapted the R&D model proposed by Tomlinson (1998). The researcher modified the models {{to be used in}} this research through the following steps: conducting preliminary- observation, formulating the questionnaire, conducting need analysis, designing the course grid, developing the first draft of the materials, revising and getting expert <b>judgment,</b> trying-out, <b>revising,</b> implementing the materials and developing the final draft of the materials. The subject of this study were the third semester students of hotel accommodation department at STP AMPTA. The instrument in this research were questionnaires, observation sheets and interview guidelines. There were two questionnaires in this research. The need analysis questionnaire was used to obtain information about the students’ needs. The expert judgment questionnaire was used to obtain the judgment about the appropriateness of the materials. The data obtained from need analysis and expert judgment were analyzed qualitatively and statistically. This research reveals as follows. (1) The target needs were classified into necessities, lacks and wants. The necessities were the needs of the skill and language focus. The lacks were due {{to the level of the}} English proficiency and the students’ difficulties in learning English tenses. The wants were about the students’ ability to speak English fluently by using some expressions usually used in hotel. (2) The learning needs consist of learning input, activities, students’ role, teachers’ role and setting. Considering the students’ learning needs, this study develops three units speaking materials: ‘telephone reservation’, ‘Room Service’ and ‘Check-in and Check-out Process’. Each units have three main parts: introduction (unit title and learning objectives), main lesson (Let’s Start, Let’s Practice and Let’s Study) and reinforcement (Let’s Get More Practice). (3) The validation result from material expert show that the developed speaking material is very good in terms of content appropriateness, presentation appropriateness, language appropriateness and lay out appropriateness with an average score of 3. 64 (very good) on unit 1, 3. 60 (very good) on unit 2, 3. 59 (very good) on unit 3. The mean score of all aspects of the three developed units in the scale of 1 - 4, is 3. 61 which is in the range of 3. 53 ≤ x ≤ 4 and can be categorized as “Very Good”.
