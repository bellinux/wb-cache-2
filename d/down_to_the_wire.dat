5|$|On December 2, Michigan {{defeated}} Syracuse in a ACC-Big Ten Challenge {{game that}} went <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wire.</b> After blowing a 10-point second half lead Michigan needed a three point shot from Albrecht with 31 seconds remaining for the victory. On December 6, Michigan suffered its first home {{loss of the}} season to the New Jersey Institute of Technology by a 72–70 margin, despite a career-high 32 points by Levert. With the loss, Michigan's 30-game home win streak versus unranked opponents was snapped. NJIT shot 11-for-17 on its three-point shots in the game. The team lost its three subsequent games to Eastern Michigan, (#3) Arizona, and SMU. The loss to Eastern Michigan, which is separated from the University of Michigan by a 6-mile stretch of Washtenaw Avenue, ended a Big Ten-high 59-game streak without consecutive losses. Eastern Michigan was led in assists (6) by Michael Talley, son of Michigan Basketball point guard and alum Michael Talley, Jr. The December 9 80–53 loss to #3 ranked Arizona was one point shy of being the largest defeat of the Beilein era. The December 20 SMU game marked the first career start by Ricky Doyle. On December 22, the team snapped its 4-game losing streak with a victory over Coppin State who was coached by Michael Grant, the brother of former Wolverine and Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year Gary Grant. One of the game's big storylines was the first regular season point by Austin Hatch. Doyle's game-high 16 points {{marked the first time}} he led the team in scoring. Michigan won its Big Ten Conference home opener against Illinois in overtime on December 30 on the day it announced Jim Harbaugh would become the new Michigan Wolverines football head coach. Aubrey Dawkins, who had a career total of 15 points entering the game, scored a game-high 20-points.|$|E

40|$|The Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) was {{developed}} for NASA s Apollo program so astronauts could cover a greater range on the lunar surface, carry more science instruments, and return more soil and rock samples than by foot. Because of the unique lunar environment, the creation of flexible wheels was the most challenging and time consuming aspect of the LRV development.

5000|$|One of {{the primary}} flaws with the HF89/90 had been a {{persistent}} lack of front grip; combined with overwhelming amounts of rear downforce, this created an intractably imbalanced car with a significant tendency to understeer. On slow, twisty circuits typical of American racing, this was a major competitive disadvantage. Thus, on the MkIII, the team first focused on creating more front downforce. This led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> inclusion of an integral front diffuser in <b>the</b> nose <b>to</b> stabilize underbody airflow and create a low-pressure zone directly under the front wheels. This was {{a break from the}} tradition of GTP and Group C cars, which had almost exclusively adhered to a single underbody with one set of tunnels running from front to rear. [...] Working in tandem with the standard ground effect tunnels under the rear of the car, the nose diffuser would balance front and rear grip while minimizing drag.To test and refine the design, a 20%-scale wind tunnel model was built, accurately replicating not just the car's external features but internal components as well — detailed <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> car's <b>wiring,</b> air ducting and engine bay plumbing. Several different nose concepts were modeled and discarded before settling on a final design. In an effort <b>to</b> conceal <b>the</b> innovative nose air extractors, the bodywork immediately behind the front wheels was painted black.|$|R
40|$|Since {{the very}} first {{observations}} of Jupiter's moons by Galileo Galilei more than four centuries ago, the size of ground-based optical telescopes has been growing steadily up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> current generation of telescopes with primary mirrors of 10 meters in diameter. The next generation of "extremely large telescopes" (ELTs) currently under preparation will almost quadruple that figure and will, for the first time, have atmospheric turbulence correction built-in by design. Inevitably, this leads {{to an increase in}} complexity and costs of the systems that control the behavior of the telescopes - the telescope control systems. Current practices therefore try <b>to</b> improve <b>the</b> reusability of the control systems design by developing reusable software frameworks, by applying model-based systems engineering, and by integrating off-the-shelf components. These efforts essentially foster the reuse of information within a single engineering discipline, across multiple engineering disciplines, and across different technologies, respectively. Despite the ability of current practices <b>to</b> build even <b>the</b> largest telescopes in history, we identified three fundamental problems that are still present. Firstly, design information (from system-level requirements to detailed software models) is mostly captured in an informal way - even if popular modeling languages are used that promise the opposite - making it impossible for a machine or another person to interpret this information as it was originally intended. Secondly, the graphical representations currently in use add even more informality to this information. Finally, the prevalence of design patterns that were adopted from object-oriented programming restricts the reuse of information now and in the future. We call these problems "fundamental" because they are severely over-constraining the designs, making it very hard to apply solutions in the future, as the telescopes evolve through their projected lifetime of several decades. The goal of this thesis is to work out a solution that addresses those problems, in way that can be realized today. By specifying, implementing, and applying a fundamental methodology change to a real telescope - and not just a temporary test set-up in an "ideal" environment - we can analyze the feasibility and the readiness of such a solution. The fundamental methodology change, promoted by this thesis, aims <b>to</b> shift <b>the</b> current practices from a traditional "model-driven" methodology towards a "knowledge-driven" methodology, in which formal knowledge representation plays a pivotal role. In the framework that we propose, domain knowledge is captured by a set of ontologies: explicit and formal representations of the concepts and other entities in the domains of interest, and the relationships that hold between them. The ontologies that we created formally define the name and the meaning of a whole range of concepts needed to represent telescope control systems, from abstract finite state machines <b>to</b> <b>the</b> specific function blocks of the IEC 61131 - 3 industrial programming language. A software library called Ontoscript was developed to automatically map those concepts <b>to</b> <b>the</b> primitives of a set of internal domain-specific languages (DSLs) based on CoffeeScript. The telescope control systems can thus be "programmed" by a set of textual DSLs whose semantics are defined by a set of ontologies and by CoffeeScript. Finally, a tool called OntoManager was developed to offer a single interface <b>to</b> <b>the</b> modeling, reasoning, querying, and template-based artifact generation capabilities of the framework in a way that can be used by domain experts who are unfamiliar with formal knowledge representation. OntoManager was used to develop a new control system for the Mercator Telescope, a 1. 2 m optical telescope located at the island of La Palma. A total of 9 subsystems were modeled, from the "slow" pneumatic control of the primary mirror support <b>to</b> <b>the</b> much faster, time-critical and safety-critical motion control of the telescope's main axes. For each subsystem, a set of interconnected models represent the systems design (including requirements and systems breakdown), the electric design (from <b>the</b> device level <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> individual <b>wires)</b> and <b>the</b> software design (from the high-level function block declarations <b>down</b> <b>to</b> implementation of <b>the</b> interlock expressions). By reasoning and by querying these models, we were able to automatically generate system specification documents, verification reports and source code for the industrial control system in charge of the telescope and for the top-level control system in charge of the whole observatory. This has lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> successful installation of the new Mercator telescope control system in June 2016. Evaluation shows that the methodology change proposed by this thesis is feasible, for a real operational telescope of at least the size of the Mercator telescope, even within the constraints imposed by a PhD project. By synthesizing state-of-the-art practices in knowledge engineering, systems engineering, and software engineering we were able to address some fundamental problems of current practices in telescope control system design, thereby making design knowledge more reusable across the boundaries of engineering disciplines and technologies. Analysis of the real-world application with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> initial requirements of the framework reveals the added value of the methodology change, but also the limitations and pitfalls of the current implementation. We conclude this thesis by reasoning about the requirements and the possible benefits of generalizing our results to much larger telescopes, or even other application areas. nrpages: 214 status: publishe...|$|R

This was Bula's last century, and indeed his last score above 30 – as he was pushed down the order to No. 6 against Wellington, he made 23 and 26, but Wellington still forced a 117-run win, before Bula rounded off his first class career with a seven-wicket win over Auckland – in a match that was shortened from three days to one due to rain. However, a two-innings game was still played, as the first three innings were all declared closed. Fiji were set 79 to win in a relatively short time, but after falling to 51 for 3 Bula hit 23 not out to guide Fiji to their fourth – and so far last – first class victory.|$|E

The 1986 season was led mostly by Mansell in championship points, and it went <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wire</b> in Adelaide, Australia for the Australian Grand Prix with Prost, Piquet and Mansell all still in contention for the title. The equation was simple, Prost and Piquet needed to win and have Mansell finish no higher than fourth. After aiming for a third-place finish which would guarantee him the title, Mansell would narrowly miss out on winning it after his left-rear tyre exploded in spectacular fashion on the main straight with only 19 laps of the race to go. In a 2012 interview for Sky Sports Legends of F1 Mansell revealed that, had he hit the wall rather than wrestling the car safely to a halt in the run-off area {{at the end of the}} straight, the stewards would most likely have red flagged the race. As the race was over two thirds distance, he would have kept his position and won his first F1 world title. Instead Mansell ended the season as runner-up to Alain Prost.
