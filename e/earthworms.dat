5|$|The common {{blackbird}} is omnivorous, {{eating a}} wide range of insects, <b>earthworms,</b> seeds and berries. It feeds mainly on the ground, running and hopping with a start-stop-start progress. It pulls <b>earthworms</b> from the soil, usually finding them by sight, but sometimes by hearing, and roots through leaf litter for other invertebrates. Small amphibians and lizards are occasionally hunted. This species will also perch in bushes to take berries and collect caterpillars and other active insects. Animal prey predominates, and is particularly important during the breeding season, with windfall apples and berries taken more in the autumn and winter. The nature of the fruit taken depends on what is locally available, and frequently includes exotics in gardens.|$|E
5|$|A 1.5 hectare {{patch of}} brown earth soil at the {{abandoned}} settlement of Papadil {{is home to}} a thriving population of <b>earthworms,</b> which are rare in the elsewhere poor soil of the island. Some individuals of Lumbricus terrestris have reached tremendous sizes, with the largest weighing 12.7 grams. This is speculated to be due to the good quality soil, and absence of predators.|$|E
5|$|Some higher {{forms of}} land life are now colonising {{the soil of}} Surtsey. The first {{earthworm}} {{was found in a}} soil sample in 1993, probably carried over from Heimaey by a bird. However, the next year <b>earthworms</b> were not found. Slugs were found in 1998, and appeared to be similar to varieties found in the southern Icelandic mainland. Spiders and beetles have also become established.|$|E

50|$|<b>Earthworm</b> Jim is {{a series}} of side-scrolling {{platforming}} video games, the first game of which was released in 1994. The series is noted for its platforming and shooting gameplay, surrealist humor, and edgy art style. Four games were released in the series: <b>Earthworm</b> Jim, <b>Earthworm</b> Jim 2, <b>Earthworm</b> Jim 3D, and <b>Earthworm</b> Jim: Menace 2 the Galaxy. The series lay dormant for almost a decade before Gameloft remade the original game in HD for PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in 2010. Interplay announced an <b>Earthworm</b> Jim 4 in 2008, but little has surfaced since.|$|R

In northwest Europe, there are concerns about the spread of the New Zealand planarian Arthurdendyus triangulatus, which preys on <b>earthworms.</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Concrete {{is a major}} {{material}} {{in the construction industry}} in Nigeria and the world at large, either mass concrete alone or sometimes complimented with other materials like steel. Calcined <b>earthworm</b> cast is cast that has been subjected to great heat. The primary aim of this research was to determine the strength characteristics of concrete incorporating calcined <b>earthworm</b> cast as partial replacement of cement. The objectives were to to obtain the optimum percentage of calcined <b>earthworm</b> cast {{that can be used to}} replace cement in a given concrete mix, and to examine the physical and chemical properties of the admixture (calcined <b>earthworm</b> cast). From the tests carried out on the characteristic of concrete using <b>earthworm</b> cast as a pozzolana, it was concluded that; the initial and final setting time of the concrete containing <b>earthworm</b> cast increases with the increase in <b>earthworm</b> cast content. The specific gravity of calcined <b>earthworm</b> cast is 2. 38. The bulk density of calcined <b>earthworm</b> cast is 1294 kg/m 3.

5|$|Among {{the types}} of insects {{consumed}} are many families of beetles, wasps and ants, flies (families Tabanidae and Asilidae), bugs, and caterpillars. Other invertebrates eaten include spiders, millipedes and <b>earthworms.</b> The flame robin consumes small prey items whole, and bashes larger victims against a hard surface repeatedly to break up before eating. The latter group constitute only 0.5% of prey over time—seasonally varying {{from a peak of}} 1.8% in autumn to a low of 0.2% of prey caught in winter.|$|E
5|$|Beetles {{are able}} to exploit a wide {{diversity}} of food sources available in their many habitats. Some are omnivores, eating both plants and animals. Other beetles are highly specialized in their diet. Many species of leaf beetles, longhorn beetles, and weevils are very host-specific, feeding on only a single species of plant. Ground beetles and rove beetles (Staphylinidae), among others, are primarily carnivorous and catch and consume many other arthropods and small prey, such as <b>earthworms</b> and snails. While most predatory beetles are generalists, a few species have more specific prey requirements or preferences.|$|E
5|$|Birds are a {{significant}} hazard to aircraft, {{but it is difficult}} to keep them away from airfields. Several methods have been explored. Stunning birds by feeding them a bait containing stupefying substances has been tried, and it may be possible to reduce their numbers on airfields by reducing the number of <b>earthworms</b> and other invertebrates by soil treatment. Leaving the grass long on airfields rather than mowing it is also a deterrent to birds. Sonic nets are being trialled; these produce sounds that birds find distracting and seem effective at keeping birds away from affected areas.|$|E
