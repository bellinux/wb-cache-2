50|$|Robin Day {{continued}} to expand Hille’s furniture collections throughout the 1950s, pioneering technical innovations such as frames made of <b>flat</b> <b>bar</b> <b>steel</b> or square-section tubular steel. His Single Convertible Bed Settee (1957), with its lightweight foam cushions and simple swing-down wooden seat back, characterised the elegant flexibility of his designs. Day {{was a great}} advocate of Pirelli rubber webbing, which he adopted {{as a replacement for}} traditional coil-sprung upholstery. In fact, he admired it {{to such a degree that}} he left it exposed as a decorative feature on several designs, including the Gatwick Chair (1958), created for Gatwick Airport, and a modular seating system called the Form Group (1960), one of several Design Centre Award winners.|$|E

30|$|The {{function}} of tension rods is combining steel supports {{into a whole}} body along longitudinal direction to avoid the tilt of steel supports, and improve the stability and bearing capacity of steel supports.

5000|$|Bladesmithing began declining {{after the}} Industrial Revolution. With {{improvements}} in steel production, bladesmiths {{no longer had}} to forge steel and knives could be machined from <b>flat</b> <b>bars</b> of <b>steel.</b> As cutlery companies moved to mass production of blades and machine tools became more available, the art of forging steel began to disappear as knifemakers could grind blades out of existing stock. [...] By the mid 20th century, bladesmithing had been relegated to a cottage industry carried out by a handful of bladesmiths.|$|R

60|$|The mariner's compass is a small, <b>flat</b> <b>bar</b> of {{magnetised}} <b>steel,</b> which, when {{balanced on}} a pivot, turns {{one of its}} ends persistently towards the north pole--the other, of course, towards the south pole; and it does this in consequence of its being magnetised. A card is fixed above, sometimes below, this <b>bar</b> of <b>steel</b> (which is called the needle), whereon are marked the cardinal points--north, south, east, and west--with their subdivisions or intermediate points, by means of which the true direction of any point can be ascertained.|$|R

The European bikes had <b>flat</b> pressed <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> and the American bikes had raised tubular bars {{but when the}} C95 was brought to Europe, it was equipped with the raised tubular bars. There was also a CS92 which had a high-level scrambler style exhaust system.|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} of {{evaluating}} tillage tools using {{computational fluid dynamics}} is proposed. Steady-state CFD only and transient two-way fluid-structure interaction simulations were run to predict draft and vertical forces on a spring-reset field cultivator standard. Using CFD the soil {{was treated as a}} visco-plastic fluid using the Bingham-plastic material model. Lab tests were run using a rigid <b>flat</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> and a production field cultivator standard with 178 and 254 mm sweeps for comparison. The results indicate that the method can be used to reasonably predict the draft force to within three standard deviations of the average measured draft. The method was successfully used to determine which sweep size created the higher draft forces. The method also was able to predict the areas on the tool with the highest pressure related to the locations that exhibit the highest wear. Soil parameters were measured using a standard technique, but modified values were needed to get good agreement between measured and calculated forces. An alternate method of measuring soil properties using a <b>flat</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bar</b> was therefore proposed. Further work is needed to determine if the modified soil properties were correct, requiring the new soil property measurement technique, or if the CFD method needs to be modified...|$|R
50|$|The Barcelona chair {{has come}} to {{represent}} the Bauhaus design movement. Many consider it to be functional art, rather than just furniture. Designed by Mies Van Der Rohe and Lilly Reich in 1929 for the German Pavilion at the international design fair, the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition, {{it is said to}} have been inspired by both the folding chairs of the Pharaohs, and the 'X' shaped footstools of the Romans, and dedicated to the Spanish royal families. Like other designers following Breuer's example, he incorporates the use of chrome-plated <b>flat</b> <b>steel</b> <b>bars</b> to create a single 'S'shaped curve. The front legs crosses the 'S' curve of the bars forming the seat and the back legs. It creates a sleek and intentionally simple aesthetic to the piece.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this work, {{fracture}} {{behavior and}} strength of mechanically fastened joint in the <b>flat</b> braided <b>bar</b> were studied. Joint strength of the braided <b>flat</b> <b>bar</b> with the braided hole was {{higher than that of}} the braided <b>flat</b> <b>bar</b> with the machined hole. In the braided hole, although joint geometry decreased, the failure mode was safe bearing failure. The calculated results agreed well with the experimental results, and it was possible to estimate the fracture behavior and joint strength of the braided <b>flat</b> <b>bar</b> with a circular hole by this analysis method. It is better for joint design that the fibers form the braided hole, around the hole, and form a reinforcement configuration with high modulus and strength as a uni-directional composite...|$|R
