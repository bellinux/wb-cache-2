5|$|Mathias {{remained}} {{active in}} his final days in the Senate, playing {{an important role in}} removing a death penalty provision in a 1986 Senate drug bill after threatening filibuster, and in preparing <b>impeachment</b> <b>proceedings</b> against federal judge Harry E. Claiborne. Mathias' last day in the Senate was January 3, 1987, at which point he was succeeded by Mikulski.|$|E
5|$|On May 26, 1874, President Ulysses S. Grant {{nominated}} Parker as Chief Justice of the Utah Territory {{to replace}} James B. McKean. However, following {{a request from}} Parker, Grant instead nominated him for the United States District Court for the Western District of Arkansas, replacing William Story who was facing <b>impeachment</b> <b>proceedings</b> due to allegations of corruption.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, Knott made an {{unsuccessful}} bid to become governor of Kentucky, losing the Democratic nomination to Preston Leslie. He was re-elected to the House of Representatives in 1875, serving four consecutive terms. He chaired the House Judiciary Committee {{for the first}} three of these terms. In 1876, he was named one of the managers of <b>impeachment</b> <b>proceedings</b> against ex-Secretary of War William W. Belknap.|$|E
50|$|On May 14, 2009, Judge Kent {{refused to}} resign {{after he was}} sentenced to prison. The House Judiciary Committee then voted to begin an <b>impeachment</b> investigation. <b>Proceedings</b> {{continued}} after the judge resigned in June 2009 but set an effective date for his resignation in 2010. Hearings were held on June 2.|$|R
5000|$|On March 2, 1936, the House of Representatives {{voted to}} impeach Judge Ritter by 181 votes to 146 on seven {{articles}} of <b>impeachment.</b> The <b>proceedings</b> {{were only the}} 13th impeachment case in the 147 years of Congress, although it took place just {{a month after the}} impeachment of Harold Louderback (who was acquitted in the Senate).

5|$|In its history, the News-Miner {{has been}} awarded dozens of accolades by the Alaska Press Club and other organizations. In 1986, News-Miner {{reporter}} Stan Jones was awarded a George Polk Award for writing a story that led to <b>impeachment</b> <b>proceedings</b> against Alaska governor Bill Sheffield. In 2009, the paper won several commendations from the Alaska Press Club for photography, sportswriting, features writing, and other accomplishments.|$|E
5|$|The President of Croatia is impeachable for any {{violation}} of the Constitution committed in performance of duty. <b>Impeachment</b> <b>proceedings</b> may be initiated by the Parliament of Croatia by a two-thirds majority vote of {{all members of the}} parliament. The impeachment of the president is then decided by the Constitutional Court, by a two-thirds majority vote of all its judges. If the Constitutional Court impeaches the president, the president's term is terminated.|$|E
5|$|As <b>impeachment</b> <b>proceedings</b> began against President Johnson, Randall {{became one}} of his leading {{defenders}} in the House. Once the House determined to impeach Johnson, Randall worked to direct the investigation to the Judiciary Committee, rather than a special committee convened for the purpose, which he believed would be stacked with pro-impeachment members. His efforts were unsuccessful, as were his speeches {{in favor of the}} president: Johnson was impeached by a vote of 128 to 47. Johnson was not convicted after his Senate trial, and Randall remained on good terms with him after the president left office.|$|E
5000|$|Mofford's {{primary goal}} as {{governor}} was to return stability to Arizona. Her efforts were widely held as providing a calming effect following the tumultuous <b>impeachment</b> and recall <b>proceedings</b> of her predecessor.|$|R
50|$|Hoping {{to further}} {{discredit}} the president, the Democrats' impeachment attempt {{focused on the}} amount of time Grant had been absent from his presidential duties. Congressman Joseph Blackburn introduced the <b>impeachment</b> measure, but <b>proceedings</b> never began. Congress tabled the resolution after the November election.|$|R
50|$|On November 16, 1939 {{the senate}} voted 28 to 19 to retain Judge Martin on the bench thus {{clearing}} him of the charges for <b>impeachment.</b> The entire <b>proceedings</b> of the senate hearings, together with the written evidences presented against Martin, amounted to over 1,700 pages, which were subsequently bound in book form in 1959 and deposited on file in the law library of Yale University.|$|R
5|$|Jonathan Jennings was {{the first}} Governor to have an {{attempted}} impeachment brought against him {{in response to his}} actions as an agent of the federal government during the negotiations of the Treaty of St. Mary's in 1819, illegal under Indiana's constitution. The evidence of his role was destroyed, and after two months of investigation the proceedings were dropped. The only other time was when the General Assembly attempted to bring <b>impeachment</b> <b>proceedings</b> against Governor James B. Ray for a similar action in 1826, but the action was also defeated 28–30.|$|E
5|$|In 1830, Wickliffe {{was chosen}} by his colleagues {{as one of the}} {{managers}} of the <b>impeachment</b> <b>proceedings</b> against Missouri District Court judge James H. Peck. In 1831, he was one of several candidates proposed by the Kentucky General Assembly to succeed John Rowan in the U.S. Senate. Of the sixty-nine votes needed to be elected to the seat, Wickliffe received forty-nine. Other candidates included John J. Crittenden (sixty-eight votes), John Breathitt (sixty-six votes), and Richard Mentor Johnson (sixty-four votes). After three days of balloting, the Assembly was still unable to fill the seat, and it was allowed to remain vacant until the next session. Wickliffe did not seek re-election to his seat in the House in 1833.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Clinton's first term, his job {{approval}} rating fluctuated in the 40s and 50s. In his second term, his rating consistently {{ranged from the}} high-50s to the high-60s. After his <b>impeachment</b> <b>proceedings</b> in 1998 and 1999, Clinton's rating reached its highest point. According to a CBS News/New York Times poll, Clinton left office with an approval rating of 68percent, which matched those of Ronald Reagan and Franklin D. Roosevelt as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era. Clinton's average Gallup poll approval rating for his last quarter in office was 61%, the highest final quarter rating any president has received for fifty years. Forty-seven {{percent of the respondents}} identified themselves as being Clinton supporters.|$|E
50|$|While Larsen {{appealed the}} {{sentencing}} order, the Pennsylvania General Assembly proceeded with <b>impeachment</b> and removal <b>proceedings.</b> The Pennsylvania House of Representatives impeached Larsen on seven charges, some {{relating to the}} crime and another relating to improper communication with a trial judge about a case. On October 4, 1994, the Pennsylvania Senate convicted Larsen of improper communication, removed him from office, and prohibited him from holding any office of public trust in the future.|$|R
6000|$|What {{is still}} more strong to the point, your Committee finds that in the 7th of William III. an act was made for the {{regulating}} of trials for treason and misprision of treason, containing several regulations for reformation of proceedings at law, both as to matters of form and substance, as well as relative to evidence. It is an act thought most essential to the liberty of the subject; yet in this high and critical matter, so deeply affecting the lives, properties, honors, and even the inheritable blood of the subject, the legislature was so tender of the high powers of this high court, deemed so necessary for the attainment of the great objects of its justice, so fearful of enervating any of its means or circumscribing any of its capacities, even by rules and restraints the most necessary for the inferior courts, that they guarded against it by an express proviso, [...] "that neither this act, nor anything therein contained, shall any ways extend to any <b>impeachment</b> or other <b>proceedings</b> in Parliament, in any land whatsoever."[12] ...|$|R
5|$|A House select {{committee}} headed by John Quincy Adams, an ardent abolitionist who disliked slaveholders like Tyler, condemned the president's {{use of the}} veto and assailed his character. While the committee's report did not formally recommend impeachment, it clearly established the possibility, and in August 1842 the House endorsed the committee's report. Adams sponsored {{a constitutional amendment to}} change both houses' two-thirds requirement (for overriding vetoes) to a simple majority, but neither house approved. The Whigs were unable to pursue further <b>impeachment</b> <b>proceedings</b> in the subsequent 28th Congress—in the elections of 1842 they retained a majority in the Senate but lost control of the House. Near the end of Tyler's term in office, on March 3, 1845, Congress overrode his veto of a minor bill relating to revenue cutters—the first override of a presidential veto.|$|E
5|$|The new English Parliament, which met in March of {{the same}} year, was quite hostile to Charles. Many members feared that he had {{intended}} to use the standing army to suppress dissent or impose Catholicism. However, with insufficient funds voted by Parliament, Charles was forced to gradually disband his troops. Having lost the support of Parliament, Danby resigned his post of Lord High Treasurer, but received a pardon from the king. In defiance of the royal will, the House of Commons declared that the dissolution of Parliament did not interrupt <b>impeachment</b> <b>proceedings,</b> and that the pardon was therefore invalid. When the House of Lords attempted to impose the punishment of exile—which the Commons thought too mild—the impeachment became stalled between the two Houses. As he had been {{required to do so}} many times during his reign, Charles bowed to the wishes of his opponents, committing Danby to the Tower of London, in which he was held for another five years.|$|E
5|$|This {{incurred}} Johnson's wrath; at {{a cabinet}} meeting immediately afterward, Johnson accused Grant of breaking {{his promise to}} remain Secretary of War. Grant disputed that he had ever made such a promise although cabinet members later testified he had done so. Newspapers friendly to Johnson published {{a series of articles}} to discredit Grant over returning the War Department to Stanton, stating that Grant had been deceptive in the matter. This public insult infuriated Grant, and he defended himself in an angry letter to Johnson, after which the two men were confirmed foes. When Grant's statement became public, it increased his popularity among Radical Republicans and he emerged from the controversy unscathed. Although Grant favored Johnson's impeachment, he took no active role in the <b>impeachment</b> <b>proceedings,</b> which were fueled in part by Johnson's removal of Stanton. Johnson barely survived, and none of the other Republican leaders directly involved benefited politically in their unsuccessful attempt to remove the president.|$|E
5|$|In August 1816 Jennings {{was elected}} {{to serve as the}} first {{governor}} of Indiana at age 32, and re-elected for an additional term. He pressed for the construction of roads and schools, and negotiated the Treaty of St. Mary's to open up central Indiana to American settlement. His opponents attacked his participation in the treaty negotiations as unconstitutional and brought <b>impeachment</b> <b>proceedings</b> against him, a measure that was narrowly defeated by a vote of 15 to 13 after a month-long investigation and the resignation of the lieutenant governor. During his second term and following the panic of 1819, Jennings encountered financial problems, a situation exacerbated by his inability to keep up with his business interests and run the state government simultaneously. Ineligible for another term as Indiana governor under the state constitution, Jennings looked for other means of financial support. Shortly before completion of his second term as governor in 1822, Jennings {{was elected to}} the U.S. House of Representatives, before retiring from public service in 1831. In Congress Jennings promoted federal spending on internal improvements.|$|E
25|$|On September 13, Gutierrez filed a {{petition}} for certiorari and prohibition to the Supreme Court {{to stop the}} <b>impeachment</b> <b>proceedings</b> against her. Gutierrez cited the one-year ban hearing more than one <b>impeachment</b> <b>proceedings.</b> Tupas said that in a previous decision, the Supreme Court allowed two separate complaints initiated at the same time. The next day, the court granted Gutierrez a status quo ante order, or all parties should observe the conditions prior to the proceedings, thereby suspending <b>impeachment</b> <b>proceedings</b> against her.|$|E
25|$|On 11 August, the National Assembly {{was summoned}} to discuss <b>impeachment</b> <b>proceedings.</b> On 18 August 2008, Musharraf {{resigned}} as President of Pakistan due to mounting political pressure from the <b>impeachment</b> <b>proceedings.</b> On 19 August 2008, Musharraf defended his nine-year rule in an hour-long speech.|$|E

25|$|Flynt's {{investigation}} {{also claimed}} that Congressman Bob Barr, another Republican House manager, {{had an affair}} while married; Barr {{had been the first}} lawmaker in either chamber to call for Clinton's resignation due to the Lewinsky affair. Barr lost a primary challenge less than three years after the <b>impeachment</b> <b>proceedings.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of President George W. Bush's reelection in 2004, several leading House Democrats {{believed}} that Democrats should pursue <b>impeachment</b> <b>proceedings</b> against the president. They asserted that Bush had misled Congress {{about weapons of mass}} destruction in Iraq, and had violated the civil liberties of Americans by authorizing wiretaps without a warrant.|$|E
25|$|Byrd {{initially}} {{said that}} the <b>impeachment</b> <b>proceedings</b> against Clinton should be taken seriously. Although he harshly criticized any attempt {{to make light of}} the allegations, he made the motion to dismiss the charges and effectively end the matter. Even though he voted against both articles of impeachment, he was the sole Democrat to vote to censure Clinton.|$|E
25|$|Chase {{served as}} Chief Justice from 1864 {{to his death}} in 1873. He presided over the Senate trial of President Andrew Johnson during the <b>impeachment</b> <b>proceedings</b> of 1868.

He unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1868 and the Liberal Republican nomination in 1872.|$|E
25|$|On December 15, {{the sixth}} {{day after the}} scandal broke with no {{resignation}} by the Governor, the Illinois House voted unanimously 113–0 to begin <b>impeachment</b> <b>proceedings.</b> This was the first impeachment inquiry against an Illinois Governor. Also, on December 15, Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan formed a bipartisan committee of inquiry within the House of Representatives.|$|E
25|$|McGee was a {{voice of}} {{moderation}} {{in the affairs of}} the Watergate scandal and the <b>impeachment</b> <b>proceedings</b> of President Richard Nixon.

25|$|In 1998, Bono {{was added}} to the House Judiciary Committee by the Republican {{leadership}} in anticipation of the consideration of <b>impeachment</b> <b>proceedings</b> against President Clinton, thus becoming the only Republican woman on the committee. Bono voted along party lines on all four motions for impeachment in both the committee and on the House floor, despite other moderate Republican House members voting against Articles II, III, and IV.|$|E
25|$|On September 1, the {{committee}} voted both complaints as sufficient in form. A week later, {{the committee}} voted both complaints as sufficient in substance. On September 13, Gutierrez {{filed a motion}} to the Supreme Court saying that the two complaints violated the one proceeding per year rule. The next day, the court voted to pass a status quo ante order that stopped the <b>impeachment</b> <b>proceedings.</b>|$|E
25|$|Others such as {{a number}} of intellectuals and legal experts in Taiwan {{published}} articles calling on the Legislative Yuan to initiate <b>impeachment</b> <b>proceedings</b> against Ma, as they argue the handling of the meeting has violated the requirements of the due Constitutional procedures. Some scholars also asked for the intervention of the legislative body and the Constitutional Court to prevent Ma from attending the meeting.|$|E
25|$|Five {{months after}} the order, the court lifted the status quo ante order, on February 15, 2011, thereby {{allowing}} the <b>impeachment</b> <b>proceedings</b> to resume, saying that while there are two complaints, {{there was only one}} hearing. The day before the committee would've met to continue the proceedings, Gutierrez filed a motion for reconsideration to reinstate the status quo ante order. The committee met anyway, and found the two complaints sufficient in grounds.|$|E
