5|$|Butterfly larvae, or caterpillars, consume plant {{leaves and}} spend {{practically}} {{all of their}} time searching for and <b>eating</b> food. Although most caterpillars are herbivorous, a few species are predators: Spalgis epius eats scale insects, while lycaenids such as Liphyra brassolis are myrmecophilous, <b>eating</b> ant larvae.|$|E
5|$|Other mammals can be destructive. Possums {{tend not}} to eat {{the leaves of the}} tree, but are very fond of <b>eating</b> the sugar-rich {{flowering}} stalks as they emerge. They also like using the tree as a sleeping place. Rabbits can be more destructive, especially during periods of drought, when they have been seen to eat through the base until a tree falls, and then <b>eating</b> the fallen tree completely. Horses can also fell a tree by <b>eating</b> through the trunk.|$|E
5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} {{is a condition}} which affects {{the functioning of the}} stomach and esophagus, also known as a functional gastroduodenal disorder. In patients that have a history of <b>eating</b> disorders, Rumination {{syndrome is}} grouped alongside <b>eating</b> disorders such as bulimia and pica, which are themselves grouped under non-psychotic mental disorder. In most healthy adolescents and adults who have no mental disability, Rumination syndrome is considered a motility disorder instead of an <b>eating</b> disorder, because the patients tend to have had no control over its occurrence and have had no history of <b>eating</b> disorders.|$|E

5|$|The {{different}} levels of ovarian hormones {{at different stages of}} the cycle have been used to explain <b>eating</b> behaviour changes. Progesterone has been shown to promote fat storage, causing a higher intake of fatty foods during the luteal phase when progesterone levels are higher. Additionally, with a high estrogen level dopamine is ineffective in converting to noradrenaline, a hormone which promotes <b>eating,</b> therefore decreasing appetite. In humans, the level of these ovarian hormones during the menstrual cycle have been found to influence binge <b>eating.</b>|$|E
5|$|To {{maintain}} a high constant body temperature is energy expensive – mammals therefore need a nutritious and plentiful diet. While the earliest mammals were probably predators, different species have since adapted {{to meet their}} dietary requirements {{in a variety of}} ways. Some eat other animals – this is a carnivorous diet (and includes insectivorous diets). Other mammals, called herbivores, eat plants, which contain complex carbohydrates such as cellulose. An herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as granivory (seed <b>eating),</b> folivory (leaf <b>eating),</b> frugivory (fruit <b>eating),</b> nectarivory (nectar <b>eating),</b> gummivory (gum <b>eating)</b> and mycophagy (fungus <b>eating).</b> The digestive tract of an herbivore is host to bacteria that ferment these complex substances, and make them available for digestion, which are either housed in the multichambered stomach or in a large cecum. Some mammals are coprophagous, consuming feces to absorb the nutrients not digested when the food was first ingested. An omnivore eats both prey and plants. Carnivorous mammals have a simple digestive tract because the proteins, lipids and minerals found in meat require {{little in the way of}} specialized digestion. Exceptions to this include baleen whales who also house gut flora in a multi-chambered stomach, like terrestrial herbivores.|$|E

However, obesity is not regarded as a psychiatric disorder, and therefore is not listed in the DSM-IVR as a psychiatric illness. The risk of overweight and obesity is higher in patients with psychiatric disorders than in persons without psychiatric disorders.|$|E
