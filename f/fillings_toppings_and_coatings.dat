To compare the abrasive {{wear resistance}} of powder materials <b>and</b> <b>coatings</b> determined {{in the case of}} different abrasive wear conditions, tests of materials <b>and</b> <b>coatings</b> to be studied were carried out at low-speed abrasion wear (2 – 3 m/s) and high-speed erosion wear (up to 80 m/s) conditions. The wear resistance with the same abrasive – quartz sand and with different test equipment was determined. The difference in wear resistance using different low-speed abrasion methods of studied coatings is small, {{but in the case of}} hardmetals and cermets it differs up to ten times; using high-speed erosion methods the wear resistance of materials <b>and</b> <b>coatings</b> is comparable. At impact wear was revealed the superiority of hardmetal...|$|R
