Part I explains {{the process by which}} the Appellate Divisions adopt Disciplinary Rules promulgated by the New York State Bar Association. Part II discusses the specific amendments to the 1970 Code which became effective September 1, 1990. Part III summarizes the overall results of the amendments to the Code. “The principal changes reflected in the 1990 Code include: making a lawyer subject to discipline for unlawfully discriminating in the practice of law (including hiring, promoting and determining conditions of employment), provided {{that there has been a}} final determination of discrimination by a tribunal other than a Departmental Disciplinary Committee, DR 1 - 102 (A) (6); limiting the obligation of a lawyer to report Code violations by another lawyer to conduct that affects the lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness to practice law, DR 1 - 103; making a supervisory lawyer responsible for misconduct of another lawyer when the supervisor knows or should know of the misconduct, at a time when the consequences of such misconduct may be avoided or mitigated, and fails to take action, DR 1 - 104; prohibiting a lawyer from charging a contingency fee in a domestic relations matter involving a divorce or the amount of maintenance, support, equitable distribution or property settlement, DR 2 - 106 (C); authorizing <b>forwarding</b> <b>fees</b> not in proportion to the work done on the matter, where the client consents to the employment of a new lawyer, the total fees are not unreasonable and each lawyer assumes joint responsibility for the representation, DR 2 - 107 (A); allowing a lawyer to withdraw an opinion after discovering that it was based on inaccurate information or is being used in furtherance of a crime or fraud, notwithstanding the fact that such a withdrawal may implicitly reveal a confidence or secret of the client, DR 4 - 101 (C) (5); providing guidelines regarding when a lawyer should reveal a client 2 ̆ 7 s intention to commit a crime, EC 4 - 7; authorizing a law firm to continue representing a client where one of the firm 2 ̆ 7 s partners or associates is disqualified from further representation because he or she may be a witness in the proceeding, DRs 5 - 101 (B), 5 - 102; codifying the 2 ̆ 2 substantial relationship 2 ̆ 2 test for determining conflicts of interest between a current and former client, DR 5 - 108; changing the standards for trial publicity from a listing of generally permitted communications to a prohibition of only those communications that a lawyer reasonably should know will have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding, DR 7 - 107; codifying the principles governing conflicts of interest when a lawyer moves between government and private practice, DR 9 - 102 (B); and making the 1990 Code gender neutral. ” Included with the article, are the following appendices: Appendix A – Excerpts from the Lawyer’s Code of Professional Responsibility, adopted by the New York State Bar Association, effective January 1, 1970, as amended effective September 1, 1990.

5000|$|Depending on the location, {{the airport}} {{improvement}} fee {{is included in}} the cost of traveller's airline ticket, in which case the airline will <b>forward</b> the <b>fee</b> to proper agency. However, in some locations the fee must be paid at the point of embarkation. This often creates difficulties for departing passengers who are unfamiliar with this type of procedure, or for departing international passengers who have already exchanged all their local currency. The amount varies usually between US$10 and $30. In some instances, the fee continues to be charged long after construction has been completed (i.e. Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport). A legitimate {{reason for this is that}} the airport must finance the cost of the improvement and then pays off these costs over an extended period of time.|$|R

40|$|This paper puts <b>forward</b> a {{sustainable}} <b>fee</b> {{structure for the}} EU Patent (COMPAT). The proposal includes pre-grant and post-grant fees and illustrates the differences between Euro-direct applications and PCT applications. The break-even analysis shows that the COMPAT would make the European patent system more attractive with significantly lower relative costs. At the same time, the new schedule provides a financially sustainable model for the system by preserving relatively high absolute fees and allowing for a fee reduction for small innovative firms and public research organizations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|Returning to South Africa, Sahajananda {{took up a}} {{teaching}} post at the FOSA (Friends of Sick Association) TB Settlement, teaching {{in the school and}} serving the sick in the wards. It was during this time that Sivananda wrote to him with a request to start a branch of Divine Life Society in South Africa. Being nervous and shy by temperament, and unaccustomed to any kind of organisational work, Sahajananda felt quite incompetent to undertake the task, and did not respond to his letter. Sivananda wrote a second letter dated 18 October 1949, requesting him to open a branch. Sahajananda was now in a fix, and thought that since he was a disciple, he should obey and <b>forwarded</b> the affiliation <b>fee</b> to register the branch. Sivananda was evidently impatient to get the branch opened, for before the affiliation fee could reach him, Sivananda sent a third letter, dated 11 November 1949, requesting a branch to be opened. Thus began the saga of Divine Life Society of South Africa.|$|R
30|$|The main {{arguments}} put <b>forward</b> against tuition <b>fees</b> {{were the}} threat to equal opportunities and the possible deterrent effects on future students. However, reliable empirical studies did not find a negative effect of tuition fees on student enrollment in Germany (e.g., Helbig et al. 2012, Bruckmeier and Wigger 2014). Nevertheless, although enrollment behavior was not affected, the imposition of tuition fees still meant an additional financial burden. While average annual spending of a student in Germany during the 2000 s amounted to about € 7600 per year for rent, food, learning material, leisure, etc., the introduction of tuition fees implied further costs of € 1000 or, on average, a 13  % increase in costs. Hence, tuition fees may affect disposable funds available for consumption or saving. If students’ expenditure matched their individual budget (constraint) previously, {{they would have had}} to increase their amount of disposable funds, for example, by increasing working hours. This may have had adverse effects on study duration or study performance. Obviously, if students were not that financially constrained, the imposition of the comparatively low tuition fees in Germany may not have affected spending behavior at all. The effect of the introduction of tuition fees therefore depends on the actual financial situation of students in Germany and cannot be derived from theoretical considerations alone.|$|R
40|$|I {{will argue}} for a simpler, fairer, more fiscally {{responsible}} and flexible form of university funding and student support. This system is designed to encourage a diverse higher education sector where high quality provision can flourish. The main points {{of the new system}} are: 1. Make student financial support available to cover all tuition and a modest cost of living. 2. Allow graduates to repay according to earnings with protection for poorer graduates. 3. Call HEFCE teaching grants “scholarships” and make students aware of their value. 4. Cap the level of funded fees plus HEFCE grant at the current level. 5. Allow universities to charge deferred fees. a. When they are paid the money goes to the student’s university not to the state. These fees have no fiscal implications. b. Bring some of the cash flow from deferred <b>fees</b> <b>forward</b> by working with a bank. 6. In the long-run move to making the cost of living support simpler by a. Providing more realistic cost of living support for all students. b. Removing means-tested university bursaries for cost of living expenses. c. Removing means-tested grants to students provided by the state. This builds on England’s higher education structure. The changes are simple to implement. It would set up a stable funding structure for our universities & provide the financial support our students need. ...|$|R
