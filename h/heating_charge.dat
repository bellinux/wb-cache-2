40|$|Purpose: This paper {{contains}} description made on thermovision testing {{with the}} use of Inframetrics 760 B system. Measurements were executed on the surface of a heat furnace and also on the surface of material heated before and hot-rolled. The results of the investigations in a form of thermograpic pictures were taken down in working environment. Design/methodology/approach: The purpose of this research was to evaluate technological process of heating cooper and brass cakes, and hot-rolled strip in special passes assessment of the temperature modification. For basic criterion estimation of these processes, the maintenance at the demanded final rolling temperature in order to keep up adequate structure and narrow range of mechanical properties variation was accepted. Findings: The process of <b>heating</b> <b>charge</b> material is carried through in order to facilitate its machining in a rolling process. When the material does not obtain the adequate temperature or does not become uniformly heated, internal stresses which cause appearance of the rims of fracture and occurrence of other defects in structure appear in cold rolling, as the next. Because of this there is a need of temperature controlling. Research limitations/implications: If a temperature profile on heated to a hot-rolled cakes is not uniform and does not reach a given level, this can mean forming some defects, which can be revealed during a hot-rolled process, relatively during following technological operations leading to a quality decrease and in a consequence to product disqualificationOriginality/value: The use of thermovision system in processes of heating cakes evolution and also hot-rolling. These research enable a condition control of thermal furnace and hot-roll processes...|$|E
