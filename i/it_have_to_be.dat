[...] Following its release, the band faced allegations of advocating the use of recreational drugs from Bill Gavin's Record Report, a weekly newsletter circulated to U.S. radio stations. [...] This resulted in [...] "Eight Miles High" [...] being banned {{in a number of}} states within a week of the report being published, a factor which contributed to the single's failure to break into the Billboard Top 10. The Byrds and their publicist, Derek Taylor, countered by strenuously denying that the song was drug-related, with Taylor issuing an indignant press release unequivocally stating that the song was about the band's trip to England and not drug use. [...] However, by the early 1980s, both Crosby and Clark were prepared to admit that the song was not entirely as innocent as they had originally declared, with the former stating [...] "Of course it was a drug song! We were stoned when we wrote it." [...] Clark was less blunt, explaining in interview that [...] "it was about a lot of things. It was about the airplane trip to England, it was about drugs, it was about all that. A piece of poetry of that nature is not limited to having <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> just about airplanes or having <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> just about drugs. It was inclusive because during those days the new experimenting with all the drugs was a very vogue thing to do." ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{segments}} later, Big Bird interrupts the adults—Maria (Sonia Manzano), David (Northern Calloway), Bob (Bob McGrath), Susan (Loretta Long), Gordon, Luis (Emilio Delgado) and Olivia (Alaina Reed Hall)—discussing {{politics by}} giving them pictures he had drawn of each of them. He gets to Mr. Hooper's picture, saying that he would {{give it to him}} when he returns. The adults tearfully and emotionally explain to Big Bird that Mr. Hooper has died and he will never come back. Big Bird reacts by getting upset, expressing his confusion and sadness. The adults reassure him that they love him and will take care of him and David reveals that he would take over the store, Mr. Hooper having left it to him in his will. Big Bird asks, [...] "Why does <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> this way? Give me one good reason!" [...] and Gordon answers, [...] "Big Bird, it has to be this way... just because." [...] Looking at Mr. Hooper's picture, Big Bird says, mispronouncing his name as he had done many times in the past, [...] "I'm going to miss you, Mr. Looper." [...] Maria tearfully corrects Big Bird and everyone gathers around him in support.|$|E

2500|$|When Mario first {{utilized}} Edgar Sampson {{to write}} the very first drafts of arrangements for the Machito and his Afro-Cubans, he would draw three sticks for Sampson underneath the bar with the three-side and two sticks underneath the bar with the two-side. This way he would always know rhythmically where {{he was in the}} chart and supervise Sampson who was unaware of the clave concept in Cuban music. Mario utilized Sampson’s harmonic mastery and Mario utilized his rhythmic mastery. Sampson asked Mario [...] "Why does <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> this way?" [...] Mario told me that he looked at Sampson and said [...] "This is what makes Cuban music Cuban!"—Sanabria (2010: 248).|$|E

NY gubernatorial candidate Carl Paladino (R) noted: [...] "The vast majority of New Yorkers and Americans have rejected their idea. If a bridge was their intent, why jam it down our throats? Why does <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> right there?"; {{he said that if}} he were elected Governor of New York, he would use the power of eminent domain to stop construction of the center and instead build a war memorial in its place.|$|E

60|$|He had no cry {{with which}} to meet the country, nor, indeed, had {{the leaders of the}} Opposition. Retrenchment, army reform, navy excellence, Mr. Palliser's decimal coinage, and general good {{government}} gave to all the old-Whig moderate Liberals plenty of matter for speeches to their future constituents. Those who were more advanced could promise the Ballot, and suggest the disestablishment of the Church. But the Government of the day was to be turned out on the score of general incompetence. They were to be made to go, because they could not command majorities. But there ought to have been no dissolution, and Mr. Daubeny was regarded by his opponents, and indeed by very many of his followers also, with an enmity that was almost ferocious. A seat in Parliament, if it be for five or six years, is a blessing; but the blessing becomes very questionable if <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sought afresh every other Session.|$|E
6000|$|Again he {{was often}} harshly judged by that {{tenacious}} class who insist that if a general principle be sound, there can never be a reason why {{it should not be}} applied forthwith, and that a rule subject to exceptions is not worth calling a rule; and the worst of it is that these people are mostly the salt of the earth. In their impatient moments they dismissed him as an opportunist, but whenever there was a chance of getting anything done, they mostly found that he was the only man with courage and resolution enough to attempt to do it. In thinking about him we have constantly to remember, as Sir George Lewis said, that government is a very rough affair at best, a huge rough machine, not the delicate springs, wheels, and balances of a chronometer, and those concerned in working <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> satisfied with what is far below the best. “Men have no business to talk of disenchantment,” Mr. Gladstone said; “ideals are never realised.” That is no reason, he meant, why men should not persist and toil and hope, and this is plainly the true temper for the politician. Yet he did not feed upon illusions. “The history of nations,” he wrote in 1876, “is a melancholy chapter; that is, the history of governments {{is one of the most}} immoral parts of human history.” ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{people had}} now a {{cessation}} from their toil. Of all the labour known to sea-faring men, that of pumping is usually {{thought to be}} the most severe. Those who work at <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> relieved every minute, and it is only by having gangs to succeed each other, that the duty can be done at all with anything like steadiness. In the present instance, it is true, that the people of the Swash were sustained by the love of gold, but glad enough were they when Mulford called out to them to [...] "knock off, and turn in for the night." [...] It was high time this summons should be made, for not only were the people excessively wearied, but the customary hours of labour were so far spent, that the light of the moon had some time before begun to blend with the little left by the parting sun. Glad enough were all hands to quit the toil; and two minutes were scarcely elapsed ere most of the crew had thrown themselves down, and were buried in deep sleep. Even Spike and Mulford took the rest they needed, the cook alone being left to look out for the changes in the weather. In a word, everybody but this idler was exhausted with pumping and bailing, and even gold had lost its power to charm, until nature was recruited by rest.|$|E
