500|$|The {{inspiration}} {{is taken}} from my own life, but also all my girlfriends who are very strong, confident girls {{who want to be}} their best in all levels of life. They’re kind of like overachievers and never seem to be satisfied with how [...] they achieve in life. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> with myself as well because you expect so much from yourself. You expect yourself to be the best friend, have a great career, be really talented and be able to cook—you just have to be great at everything. I think genders have been washed out a little bit -- like you have to have masculine qualities as well as feminine. It’s just a song that recognizes {{what it takes to be}} a girl today, and it’s quite a lot.|$|E
500|$|Music for Captain Scarlet was {{composed}} by Barry Gray, an innovator in electronic music, who had scored all the Supermarionation series preceding it. The opening title sequence theme, [...] "The Mysterons", was rendered electronically {{and accompanied by}} a staccato drum beat to introduce the lead character of Captain Scarlet. This seven-note beat was also used to link scenes within episodes, and to cut to advertisement breaks, {{for which it was}} accompanied by a zooming image of the Spectrum logo as designed by Tony Dunsterville of the art department. On the subject of the beat, Anderson recalls, [...] "When I went to the recording session, I heard the drum beat he had come up with and I thought, 'Christ, is this all he could produce?' Looking back on it, however, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> what he came up with worked very well." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Amber 31422" [...] was {{watched by}} an {{estimated}} 4.97 million viewers in the United States. The episode had a season low rating of 1.8/5 among viewers 18–49, which was down 10% {{from the previous}} episode that aired on October 14. Between Fringe and its lead-in show Bones, Fox finished in third place for the night. The Fringe episode's low ratings have been attributed by critics to the unexpected end to the 2010 World Series, which caused Fringe to air a week earlier than expected. Den of Geek columnist Billy Grifter attributed the low ratings to the parallel universe focus, commenting [...] "if you weren't a fan beforehand, you'll {{not be able to}} follow what's going on now. For those of us that did step onto the Fringe elevator early, it's a great ride, but <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> it's a difficult proposition to attract new viewers." [...] Time shifted viewing increased the episode's ratings by 44 percent among adults, resulting in a rise from 1.8 to 2.6.|$|E
500|$|During Howard's solo concerts from 1983to 1999, [...] "Shivers" [...] was {{the song}} most {{requested}} by audience members. However, {{by the time}} of his final tour in 2009—the year he died—he had stopped receiving requests for it. In an October 2009 interview, Howard commented on his relationship with the song, and its position in his setlists, stating: [...] "I have just tried, perhaps finally successfully, to divorce myself from the song. It's impossible for me to recreate what I was trying to do when I wrote that song so whilst <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> people have an attachment to it, I don't. I feel like, when I did use to do it in shows, I was doing a cover of some song that had been around forever. That's how it felt. And I guess that is a strange way to feel about a song you wrote, so yeah, I am happy to not have to do it these days".|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{the main}} cast {{proposed}} for the film included Marilyn Miller, Gilda Gray, Ann Pennington, and Leon Errol. Featured in the film are William Powell as Ziegfeld, Myrna Loy as Billie Burke, Luise Rainer as Anna Held, Nat Pendleton as Eugen Sandow, and Frank Morgan. Powell admitted to being [...] "amazed" [...] with the film after viewing it and was very grateful at having had the privilege to portray Ziegfeld, considering {{it to be a}} very important moment in his career. He said, [...] "After seeing this film <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> most of the characters I have played before were contrived. They had no 'folks', as the character of Ziegfeld had in this picture. Their father was a pen and their mother was a bottle of ink. Here was a character with flesh, blood and sinews. I felt {{for the first time in}} my acting career I had tried the full measure of a man, regardless of my shortcomings in playing him." ...|$|E

500|$|The band {{recorded}} {{their debut}} album, Unknown Pleasures in April 1979 at Strawberry Studios, Stockport. Producer Martin Hannett significantly altered their live sound, {{a fact that}} greatly displeased the band at the time. Hook said in 2006 that the album [...] "definitely didn't turn out sounding the way I wanted it But now <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Martin {{did a good job}} on it There's no two ways about it, Martin Hannett created the Joy Division sound". The album cover was designed by Peter Saville, who would go on to provide artwork for future Joy Division releases. Unknown Pleasures was released in June and sold through its initial pressing of 10,000 copies. Tony Wilson said that the relative success of the album turned the indie label into a true business and a [...] "revolutionary force" [...] that operated outside of the major record label system. Reviewing the album for Melody Maker, writer Jon Savage described the album as an [...] "opaque manifesto" [...] and declared [...] "eaving the twentieth century is difficult; most people prefer to go back and nostalgise. Oh boy. Joy Division at least set a course in the present with contrails for the future—perhaps you can't ask for much more. Indeed, Unknown Pleasures may very well be one of the best, white, English, debut LPs of the year".|$|E

He encouraged university leaders to stop talking about privatization and instead push their state lawmakers to increase funding for higher education and research as a public good.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2010, scenes showing Phil and Rainie {{taking the}} drug crack cocaine {{prompted}} over 200 complaints from viewers who felt the scenes were inappropriate. The BBC responded by saying [...] "EastEnders in no way – and at no point – glamorises or condones the use of drugs, and furthermore we took great care to avoid any demonstration on how to prepare or take drugs. We feel that Phil's decline will highlight the destructive nature of drugs, and rather than encourage drug use, will act as a deterrent." [...] A former cocaine addict, Sarah Graham, agreed with the BBC, saying [...] "I think it's really important that a mainstream character like Phil Mitchell is doing this storyline. [...] I'm not surprised {{that there have been}} so many complaints about seeing this on one of our favourite soaps. The episode showed the brutal reality of addiction. [...] <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> many people will be worried about children watching these scenes. [...] With that in mind, I think they should put the Frank drugs helpline number on after the programme." ...|$|E
