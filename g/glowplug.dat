The <b>glowplug</b> engine's glow plug has a pinlike terminal for its center contact, which is an electrical connector for the <b>glowplug.</b> The [...] "diesel" [...] engine has a T-bar which is used for adjusting the compression. The cylindrical object behind the <b>glowplug</b> engine is an exhaust silencer or muffler.|$|E
50|$|A <b>glowplug</b> {{resembles a}} short metal pencil. The heating {{filament}} is fitted into its tip. <b>Glowplug</b> filaments {{must be made}} of certain materials, such as platinum and iridium, that resist oxidation and high temperature.|$|E

50|$|A {{diesel engine}} uses heat and high {{compression}} (compression ratios commonly 22:1 versus 9:1 for gasoline) to ignite the fuel. When normally starting a modern diesel engine, it typically uses <b>glowplugs</b> to preheat the cylinder(s). If a battery is completely discharged then {{it may not}} provide the necessary electrical power to 'glow' the <b>glowplugs,</b> making the push starting of a diesel vehicle with a dead battery almost impossible.|$|R

50|$|Most planes need a {{powerplant}} {{to drive}} them, the exception being gliders. The most popular types for radio-controlled aircraft are internal combustion engines, electric motors, jet, and rocket engines. Three types of internal combustion engines are available being small 2 and 4 stroke engines. <b>Glowplug</b> engines use nitro-methanol as fuel, compressive ignition ('diesel') burn paraffin with ether as an ignition agent. Larger engines can be <b>glowplug</b> but increasingly common gasoline is the fuel of choice.|$|E
25|$|Compression {{ignition}} Diesel engines {{ignite the}} fuel-air mixture {{by the heat}} of compression and do not need a spark. They usually have <b>glowplugs</b> that preheat the combustion chamber to allow starting in cold weather. Other engines may use a flame, or a heated tube, for ignition. While this was common for very early engines it is now rare.|$|R
5000|$|Direct-injected small {{diesel engines}} still were not {{practical}} [...] and the prechambered indirect injection engine was invented, {{along with the}} requirement of <b>glowplugs</b> {{to be used for}} starting. With technology developed by Robert Bosch GmbH pump and injector systems could be built to run at a much higher pressure. Combined with high-precision injectors, high-speed diesels were produced from 1927.|$|R
50|$|Because these {{engines are}} {{relatively}} low displacement and quite compact, {{they have a}} low surface area. The resulting reduced surface area of the direct injection diesel engine reduces heat losses, and thereby increases engine efficiency, {{at the expense of}} slightly increased combustion noise. A direct injection engine is also easier to start when cold, because of more efficient placing and usage of <b>glowplugs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For faster engine startup the M21 has a <b>glowplug</b> {{system called}} instant start, which reduces {{the time to}} reach {{starting}} temperature compared to similar diesel engines. The fuel is injected into swirl chambers.|$|E
50|$|A <b>glowplug</b> (alternatively spelled as {{glow plug}} or glow-plug) is a heating device used to aid {{starting}} diesel engines. In cold weather, {{high speed diesel}} engines {{can be difficult to}} start because the mass of the cylinder block and cylinder head absorb the heat of compression, preventing ignition (which relies on that heat). Pre-chambered engines use small electric heaters (glowplugs) inside the pre-chambers. Direct-injected engines have these glowplugs in the combustion chamber. The <b>glowplug</b> is a pencil-shaped piece of metal with a heating element at the tip. This heating element, when electrified, heats due to its electrical resistance and begins to emit light in the visible spectrum, hence the term <b>glowplug.</b> The visual effect is similar to the heating element in a toaster. The fuel injector spray pattern then impinges directly upon the hot tip of the glow plug during the injection of fuel at top dead center. This ignites the fuel even when the engine is insufficiently hot for normal operation, which reduces the cranking time to start the engine.|$|E
5000|$|Mitsubishi's new clean {{diesel engines}} use a [...] {{high-pressure}} {{common rail injection system}} to improve combustion efficiency. The 4N13 1.8-liter uses solenoid fuel-injectors. The larger 4N14 2.3-liter engine uses piezo fuel-injectors that produce a finer fuel spray. Both engines feature a fast ceramic <b>glowplug</b> system. The engines {{are designed to}} operate at a lower compression ratio, thus lowering the combustion pressure, allowing the use of an aluminium cylinder block that reduces weight.|$|E
50|$|Appearing in the 1989-1998 Dodge Ram pickup truck, {{it became}} a popular {{alternative}} to the large V8 gasoline engines normally used in full-size pickup trucks, since it produced the torque at low engine speeds, and significantly better fuel mileage. During that time, the Dodge Ram was the only diesel pickup that did not rely on <b>glowplugs</b> for cold weather starting.|$|R
50|$|In cold weather, {{high speed}} diesel engines can be {{difficult}} to start because the mass of the cylinder block and cylinder head absorb the heat of compression, preventing ignition due to the higher surface-to-volume ratio. Pre-chambered engines make use of small electric heaters inside the pre-chambers called <b>glowplugs,</b> while direct-injected engines have these <b>glowplugs</b> in the combustion chamber. Many engines use resistive heaters in the intake manifold to warm the inlet air for starting, or until the engine reaches operating temperature. Engine block heaters (electric resistive heaters in the engine block) connected to the utility grid are used in cold climates when an engine is turned off for extended periods (more than an hour), to reduce startup time and engine wear. Block heaters are also used for emergency power standby Diesel-powered generators which must rapidly pick up load on a power failure. In the past, a wider variety of cold-start methods were used. Some engines, such as Detroit Diesel engines used a system to introduce small amounts of ether into the inlet manifold to start combustion. Others used a mixed system, with a resistive heater burning methanol. An impromptu method, particularly on out-of-tune engines, is to manually spray an aerosol can of ether-based engine starter fluid into the intake air stream (usually through the intake air filter assembly).|$|R
5|$|One of {{the major}} {{applications}} of sintered silicon nitride is in automobile industry as a material for engine parts. Those include, in diesel engines, <b>glowplugs</b> for faster start-up; precombustion chambers (swirl chambers) for lower emissions, faster start-up and lower noise; turbocharger for reduced engine lag and emissions. In spark-ignition engines, silicon nitride is used for rocker arm pads for lower wear, turbocharger for lower inertia and less engine lag, and in exhaust gas control valves for increased acceleration. As examples of production levels, there is an estimated more than 300,000 sintered silicon nitride turbochargers made annually.|$|R
5000|$|F3D is {{the fastest}} class in [...] "glow-powered" [...] pylon racing. These planes reach speeds of over 100 m/s (225 mph) on the race course. The race course {{is the same as}} in AMA 424 or AMA 428, but there are few limits on the {{airframe}} and engine. The maximum engine displacement is [...]40ci, ignition must be a <b>glowplug,</b> fuel must be 80% methanol/20% castor oil, all else is free. There are airframe limits on wing thickness, fuselage dimensions, and weight for safety reasons.|$|E
5000|$|The Ki-Gass system, also {{referred}} to as Kigass or K-Gas, is [...] "a system of starting petrol and Diesel engines by injecting finely divided fuel {{in the form of a}} mist into the in-take pipe." [...] The system uses a hand-pump to spray fuel into the air in-take, thus priming the engine for easier starting. In the case of diesel engines, this spray was aimed at a heated <b>Glowplug</b> fitted into the manifold. Ki-Gass systems were widely used on aircraft, cars and tractors in 1944, including British Spitfire and Hurricane fighters.|$|E
5000|$|In older {{generation}} diesel-engine vehicles, unlike in a gasoline-engine vehicle, for a 'cold start' the operator did not simply turn {{the key to}} the [...] "start" [...] position and have the engine immediately start. Instead, the operator activated the glow plug(s) for a time first. Early diesels used the 'Thermostart' type <b>glowplug</b> in the inlet manifold. These take 20 seconds to achieve working temperature and the vehicle operator had to manually time (or guess) when the 20 seconds had elapsed. With in-cylinder glow plugs, technological improvements included a warning light on the dash to indicate how long the preheating should last. The preheating phase was also made to be automatically activated when the operator turned {{the key to the}} [...] "on" [...] position for a long duration; the <b>glowplug</b> relay switches the glowplugs on, and a light (see picture at right) on the instrument cluster illuminates. This process is called [...] "pre-heating" [...] or [...] "glowing". Many modern diesels automatically activate their glow plugs when the operator unlocks the vehicle or opens the door to the car, thus simplifying the process and shortening the time the operator has to wait before the engine will start. According to Bosch: [...] "Older engines with Thermostart manifold plugs used a glow period of up to 20 seconds whereas more modern engines use around a 6 to 8 second heat period and provide after glow at a reduced voltage." ...|$|E
5000|$|The hot bulbs {{started to}} develop cracks and breakups and were {{gradually}} replaced by water cooled cylinder heads {{with a flat}} hot spot. Over time the compression ratios were increased from 3:1 to 14:1. Fuel injection started from 135 degrees {{before top dead center}} with low compression down to 20 degrees before top dead center with later higher compression engines increasing the hot air factor [...] for ignition and increasing the fuel efficiency. <b>Glowplugs</b> finally replaced the preheating with a blowtorch methods and engine speeds were increased, resulting in what is now classified as an indirect-injection diesel.|$|R
50|$|The OM 138 has one {{cylinder}} head {{for all four}} cylinders. The main part are the precombustion chambers. They are located in a 45° angle above the combustion chamber {{and placed in a}} bulge in the {{cylinder head}}. Like other early OM diesel engines, the OM 138 has a sieve for fuel spraying purposes between the main combustion chamber and precombustion chamber. The injection nozzles inject fuel into the precombustion chambers, they are mounted on the cylinder head and can be maintained with ease. The <b>glowplugs</b> are mounted underneath the injection nozzles and are easily accessible as well. On it′s precombustion chamber side, the cylinder head also has the pushrods necessary for the OHV valvetrain. The intake and outlet are at the opposite side; the intake manifold {{is a part of the}} cylinder head and located at it′s top.|$|R
50|$|The {{precombustion chamber}} {{patented}} in 1909 by L'Orange {{connects to the}} engine cylinder via a restricted passage, or burner. In operation, a narrow cone of fuel is sprayed down towards the burner by the single orifice injector nozzle. At this time the technology did not exist to manufacture nozzles with multiple orifices and diesels used high pressure air to spray the fuel directly into the cylinder. L'Orange also discovered that indirect injection diesel engines ran more smoothly and quietly than direct injection engines. Use of a precombustion chamber also reduced stress on the engine's structure, {{so that it could}} be made less heavy than a direct injection engine. However, indirect injection engines require higher compression ratios, about 20:1, to compensate for the greater surface to volume ratio causing more heat loss from the cylinder charge. They are also more difficult to start when cold, therefore the precombustion chambers are fitted with electrically heated <b>glowplugs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|With {{in-cylinder}} glow plugs, when a pre-set {{time has}} elapsed, the <b>glowplug</b> relay switches off the [...] "wait-to-start" [...] light. A pre-heating cycle usually lasts for 2 to 5 seconds. The operator then proceeds {{to turn the}} key to the [...] "start" [...] position. The relay switches off the glowplugs after the engine is running (or, in older cars, {{at the same time the}} [...] "wait to start" [...] light goes out). In some cars, in order to maintain compliance with emissions regulations, the glow plugs may be operated immediately after engine start, or during periods of extended idle where engine temperature has decreased, as combustion efficiency is greatly reduced when the engine is below operating temperature.|$|E
5000|$|... in 1895, {{the first}} {{four-stroke}} engine {{was ready for}} production. The 138 cc (bore 50 mm, stroke 70 mm) single cylinder engine with a surface carburettor produced 0.5 HP at an engine speed of 1500 RPM, a remarkably high speed for the time. For comparison: Hildebrand & Wolfmüller reached 240 RPM, the Daimler Reitwagen motor ran at maximum 750 RPM. Bouton {{found out that the}} <b>glowplug</b> ignition was the obstacle to higher speeds. He developed a high voltage ignition system for the motor with circuit breaker. The dry battery for the ignition is located under the upper frame tube (in the case of a motor tricycle); ignition timing could be adjusted with a small lever. Side valves were driven via a gear-driven camshaft, with automatic snifting valve activation. The advantage of the design should have been very early (0-5 degrees before top dead centre) opening inlet valve. The cylinder head was removable and bolted with four bolts on the crank case. The weight of the existing cast iron engine including all auxiliary units amounted to less than 20 kg. [...] "The benefits of this engine were simplicity and ease." ...|$|E
50|$|Glow plugs {{are used}} for {{starting}} as well as continuing the power cycle. The glow plug consists of a durable, mostly platinum, helically wound wire filament, within a cylindrical pocket in the plug body, exposed to the combustion chamber. A small direct current voltage (around 1.5 volts) {{is applied to the}} glow plug, the engine is then started, and the voltage is removed. The burning of the fuel/air mixture in a glow-plug model engine, which requires methanol for the glow plug to work in the first place, and sometimes with the use of nitromethane for greater power output and steadier idle, occurs due to the catalytic reaction of the methanol vapor to the presence of the platinum in the filament, thus causing the ignition. This keeps the plug's filament glowing hot, and allows it to ignite the next charge. Since the ignition timing is not controlled electrically, as in a spark ignition engine or by fuel injection, as in an ordinary diesel, it must be adjusted by the richness of the mixture, the ratio of nitromethane to methanol, the compression ratio, the cooling of the cylinder head, the type of glow plug, etc. A richer mixture will tend to cool the filament and so retard ignition, slowing the engine, and a rich mixture also eases starting. After starting the engine can easily be leaned (by adjusting a needle valve in the spraybar) to obtain maximum power. <b>Glowplug</b> engines are also known as nitro engines. Nitro engines require a 1.5 volt ignitor to light the glow plug in the heat sink. Once primed, pulling the starter with the ignitor in will start the engine.|$|E
5000|$|A Cummins B Series {{engine was}} also {{added to the}} engine lineup and, for the first time, Dodge saw sales go up. The Cummins can be coupled with a heavier-duty version of the A727 {{automatic}} or a 5-speed manual transmission and is available on 250 and 350 pickups and pickup-based chassis-cab trucks. This diesel engine option is drastically different from Ford and GM diesel engines that were optioned at the time. The Cummins features direct injection, whereas the Ford and GM diesels feature indirect injection; this also means that the Cummins doesn't {{have to rely on}} <b>glowplugs.</b> The Cummins is a straight-six engine, whereas the GM and Ford diesel engines are V8 engines. As well, the Cummins is turbocharged, while the 6.2L GM/DDC and 7.3 IDI Ford/IH are naturally aspirated. [...] This was not the first engine to appear in Dodge pickup trucks as a diesel option. Mid-1970s D models offered the rare, underpowered, Mitsubishi naturally-aspirated diesel.|$|R
50|$|Diesel, PPC and HCCI engines, rely {{solely on}} heat and {{pressure}} created by the engine in its compression process for ignition. The compression level that occurs is usually twice or more than a gasoline engine. Diesel engines take in air only, and shortly before peak compression, spray a small quantity of diesel fuel into the cylinder via a fuel injector that allows the fuel to instantly ignite. HCCI type engines take in both air and fuel, but continue to rely on an unaided auto-combustion process, due to higher pressures and heat. This is also why diesel and HCCI engines {{are more susceptible to}} cold-starting issues, although they run just as well in cold weather once started. Light duty diesel engines with indirect injection in automobiles and light trucks employ <b>glowplugs</b> (or other pre-heating: see Cummins ISB#6BT) that pre-heat the combustion chamber just before starting to reduce no-start conditions in cold weather. Most diesels also have a battery and charging system; nevertheless, this system is secondary and is added by manufacturers as a luxury for the ease of starting, turning fuel on and off (which can also be done via a switch or mechanical apparatus), and for running auxiliary electrical components and accessories. Most new engines rely on electrical and electronic engine control units (ECU) that also adjust the combustion process to increase efficiency and reduce emissions.|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{diesel engines}} with ethanol as fuel are {{associated}} with problems due to high self-ignition temperature of the fuel. The hot surface ignition method, wherein {{a part of the}} injected fuel is made to touch an electrically heated hot surface (<b>glowplug)</b> for ignition, is an effective way of utilizing ethanol in conventional diesel engines. The {{purpose of the present study}} is to investigate the effect of thermal insulation on ethanol fueled compression ignition engine. One of the important ethanol properties to be considered in the high compression ratio engine is the long ignition delay of the fuel, normally characterized by lower cetane number. In the present study, the ignition delay was controlled by partial insulation of the combustion chamber (low heat rejection engine) by plasma spray coating of yttria stabilized zirconia for a thickness of 300 Â [mu]m. Experiments were carried out on the <b>glowplug</b> assisted engine with and without insulation in order to find out the possible benefits of combustion chamber insulation in ethanol and diesel operation. Highest brake thermal efficiency of 32 % was obtained with ethanol fuel by insulating the combustion chamber. Emissions of the unburnt hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxides were higher than that of diesel. But the smoke intensity and was less than that of diesel engine. Volumetric efficiency of the engine was reduced by a maximum of 9 % in LHR mode of operation. Low heat rejection Ethanol <b>Glowplug</b> Diesel engine Alternate fuel Ceramic coating...|$|E
40|$|Hot surface {{ignition}} {{is relevant}} {{in the context}} of industrial safety. In the present work, two-dimensional simulations using simplified kinetics of the buoyancy-driven flow and ignition of a slightly lean n-hexane–air mixture by a rapidly heated surface (<b>glowplug)</b> are reported. Experimentally, ignition is most often observed to occur {{at the top of the}} glowplug; numerical results reproduce this trend and shed light on this behavior. The numerical predictions of the flow field and hot surface temperature at ignition are in quantitative agreement with experiments. The simulations suggest that flow separation plays a crucial role in creating zones where convective losses are minimized and heat diffusion is maximized, resulting in the critical conditions for ignition to take place...|$|E
40|$|The {{cold start}} {{performance}} of automotive diesel engines is currently poor {{when compared to}} similar gasoline units. This thesis describes an experimental and theoretical investigation into the factors limiting diesel cold start behaviour. Studies {{have been carried out}} on IDI and DI designs of engine. Start behaviour has been characterised in terms of times taken to complete various stages of startup, engine speed variations and processes which affect these. Combustion and friction behaviour have been investigated in detail. Engine friction losses are dependent on temperature. During start-up these losses are relatively high compared to those when the engine is fully-warm. The work output from combustion is low at low speeds, and prone to a further deterioration at lower temperatures. Consequently, combustion output during cold cranking is initially insufficient to overcome frictional losses. The start times are extended by the need to keep the starter motor engaged until heat generated in the engine causes frictional losses to fall. Eventually, when combustion output is able to overcome friction without the aid of starter motor work, idle speed is reached. Changes to fuel injection and <b>glowplug</b> parameters have been used to achieve a limited improvement in low-temperature starting. Measurements of engine friction have been carried out to determine the influence of temperature and speed, and the relative contributions from each of the main component assemblies. At low temperatures, much of the friction originates in hydrodynamically lubricated components such as journal bearings, due to high oil viscosity at low temperature. Additionally, engine friction as rotation begins {{has been shown to be}} far higher than measured by conventional "steady-state" motoring tests (over twice the quasi-steady state friction at - 200 e). This initially high friction transient decays towards the quasi-steady values throughout the start. For crankshaft bearings, a friction model has been developed for cold start-up through to fully warm engine conditions. The friction behaviour in the bearings is dependent on thermal conditions around the friction surfaces. Models for the starter system and blowby processes are also presented as part of a broader theoretical investigation to assess the impact of design changes on start quality...|$|E
40|$|The {{ultimate}} goal {{and hope for}} engines of the near future {{is the development of}} wide range fuel-flexibility within internal combustion engines. This research dissertation presents three innovations that have pushed the boundary of science and technology to enable this vision on the mini scale. First, the design and construction of a new small-scale, fuel flexible, engine dynamometer that allowed for precise measurement and control of mini engines operating on non standard fuels. Second, the fuel-flexible characterization of the O. S. Graupner Wankel engine and the successful production of output mechanical power between 10 - 500 W from a range of petroleum-based and bio fuels: gasoline, diesel, biodiesel, bioethanol and military-grade JP 8 (among others). Lastly, a low-cost, multi-fuel switching system was designed and tested that controllably delivered a range of fuels to the engine and allowed for the first continual fuel-flexible operation using an array of fuels. In addition to these scientific contributions, it will be shown how the small-scale engine dynamometer and its peripherals were designed, constructed and tested such that future researchers can make advancements toward the {{ultimate goal}} enabling wide-range fuel flexibility on the small scale. This work determined a number of the key parameters for small-scale fuel flexible engine operation (4. 97 cc). Previous work only showed that fuel flexibility was possible in larger scale rotary engines and turbines [...] where operating conditions differ greatly from their smaller-scale counterparts. The present work extended the understanding of what engine parameters are critical for enabling fuel-flexible engine operation on this small scale and helped discover the strengths, weaknesses and opportunities of mini fuel flexible rotary engines which prior work had not described. The design and construction of a new small-scale engine dynamometer was essential as no commercially available dynamometers on this scale existed and the legacy systems failed to capture all necessary engine data; especially those needed to characterize fuel flexibility. This dynamometer consisted of an engine mount and loading system, therequired sensors for measurement, the actuators to dynamically and repeatedly control engine and the integration of all these elements into a usable data acquisition system. The characterization consisted mainly of the maximum power outputs of the engine while running on specific fuels, the engine operating conditions during max power output, the stoichiometry ranges of each fuel {{in the context of the}} O. S. Graupner Wankel engine and output efficiencies. Other preliminary characterizations on emissions, combustion pressure and other typical engine tests were developed but not fully characterized but will be introduced. The design and construction of a multi-fuel switching system was also integral to extending and characterizing fuel flexibility on this small scale. Early experiments only tested fuels independently and switched between them by hand. However, future systems would need to be able to change fuels on-demand and sequentially in real time. Therefore, a system that could accommodate the storage of multiple fuels and then deliver them reliably to the engine at the click of an on-screen fuel selector button was built, better syncing the fuel data with the engine performance data. The resulting fuel-flexible engine characterization system was then tested amongst a variety of liquid hydrocarbon based fuels in order to create a fuel-flexible engine mapping for a Wankel engine of 4. 97 cc displacement. During multi-fuel combustion, the following parameters were measured in an effort to fully characterize this engine: engine torque, mass flow rate of ambient air intake, stoichiometry, ambient temperature and humidity, ambient pressure, engine speed, mass fuel flow rate, engine housing temperature, engine exhaust temperature and loading brake temperature and the fuel selection. This data collection was possible through the design and integration of the LabVIEW data acquisition system architecture in concert four input / output devices: the NI-USB- 6221, NI-USB- 9162 and two ArduinoUNO microcontrollers. The design and integration will be fully described along with the new system potential and shortcomings. In addition to the data acquisition, the system was also designed to enable future real-time control using conventional low-cost model engine servos such that the system could be fully automated. In the current system, there are eight actuation devices that control the throttle position, the glow plug heat, the fuel to air ratio, the dynamometer brake and four electrovalves that control the delivery of each fuel. The mechanical design and construction of all these control mechanisms are also described along with their added potential to enhancing fuel flexibility and opportunities for future improvement. The fuel flexible dynamometer system, multi fuel switching system, data acquisition and system control enabled fuel flexible operation of a Wankel engine of 4. 97 cc displacement. The maximum mechanical power produced from Gasoline, Glowfuel (methanol+nitromethane mix), JP 8, Diesel and Biodiesel were 334 W, 508 W, 313 W, 239 W and 322 W respectively. Methanol did not require active <b>glowplug</b> power while the 87 octane, diesel and JP 8 fuels did. Good throttle response for both Methanol and JP 8 was observed however the 87 octane operation, there was little to no throttle response during combustion. This dissertation research clearly demonstrates that small-scale Wankel rotary engines are fuel flexible across at least 6 different fuels: methanol, gasoline, diesel, JP 8, biodiesel and ethanol. This dissertation is broken down into six separate chapters: Chapter 1 Introduction that describes the motivations and background of this research, Chapter 2 : Theory which gets the reader up to speed with the relevant engineering concepts, Chapter 3 : Experimental Setup Design which describes how the fuel flexible characterization system was built, Chapter 4 : Experimental Results which succinctly presents all data key data collected during this research, Chapter 5 : Discussion and Analysis which are the conclusions drawn from the captured data and Chapter 6 : Conclusions which briefly reiterates the key developments presented in this dissertation. It is the hopes of the author that this research serves as a stepping stone in future development efforts and allows science and technology to arrive at a point where wide range and robust fuel flexibility is possible...|$|E
