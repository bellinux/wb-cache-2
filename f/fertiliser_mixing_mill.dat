50|$|Mashing is {{the process}} of <b>mixing</b> <b>milled,</b> usually malted, grain with water, and heating it with rests at certain {{temperatures}} to allow enzymes in the malt to break down the starches in the grain into sugars, especially maltose. Lautering is the separation of the extracts won during mashing from the spent grain to create wort. It is achieved in either a lauter tun, a wide vessel with a false bottom, or a mash filter, a plate-and-frame filter designed for this kind of separation. Lautering has two stages: first wort run-off, during which the extract is separated in an undiluted state from the spent grains, and sparging, in which extract that remains with the grains is rinsed off with hot water.|$|R

Scanning electron micrographs confirm the proper distribution of CNFs within the elastomeric host matrix. The successful incorporation of CNFs into PR has reduced the back-face temperature and increased the ablation resistance CNF/PR elastomeric nanocomposite in front of ultrahigh temperature (oxyacetylene flame exposure). Carbon nanofiber network with the elastomeric chain restricts the thermal transport within the CNF/PR nanocomposite specimens. The synergistic effect of CNFs on crystallization, glass transition, melting temperatures (Tm) of PR elastomeric nanocomposites is studied.

5000|$|In {{olive oil}} extraction, malaxation (Latin malaxare, Greek μαλακος meaning [...] "soft") is {{the action of}} slowly {{churning}} or <b>mixing</b> <b>milled</b> olives, typically for 20 to 40 minutes. The churning allows the smaller droplets of oil released by the milling process to aggregate and be more easily separated. The paste is normally heated to around 27 °C during this process.

However, the use of higher temperatures and longer mixing times increases oxidation of the oil and therefore decreases shelf life, so a compromise must be struck.

40|$|Background and Aim: Recycled {{sources of}} {{phosphorus}} (P), such as struvite extracted from wastewater, have potential {{to substitute for}} more soluble manufactured fertilizers and help reduce the long-term threat to food security from dwindling finite reserves of phosphate rock (PR). This study aimed to determine whether struvite could be a component of a sustainable P fertiliser management strategy for arable crops. Methods: A combination of laboratory experiments, pot trials and mathematical modelling of the root system examined the P release properties of commercial fertiliser-grade struvite and patterns of P uptake from a low-P sandy soil by two different crop types, in comparison to more soluble inorganic P fertilisers (di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and triple super phosphate (TSP)). Results: Struvite had greatly enhanced solubility {{in the presence of}} organic acid anions; buckwheat, which exudes a high level of organic acids, was more effective at mobilising struvite P than the low level exuder, spring wheat. Struvite granules placed with the seed did not provide the same rate of P supply as placed DAP granules for early growth, but <b>fertiliser</b> <b>mixes</b> containing struvite and DAP applied to spring wheat demonstrated optimal early P-uptake and higher rates of P-fertiliser recovery. Conclusions: We conclude that the potential resource savings and efficiency benefits of utilising a recycled slow release fertiliser like struvite offers a more sustainable alternative to only using conventional, high solubility, PR-based fertilisers. ?<br/...|$|R

Such deficiencies may be corrected by foliar fertilisations, but in French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) no experimental data may be found to support this hypothesis. Therefore this paper was aimed at studying the effect of foliar Mg-applications (56, 112 and 224 g ha- 1 in single application at flowering or splitted half dose at 4 -leaf stage and half at flowering) alone and with Zn (200 g ha- 1) on yield and quality of two French bean genotypes (Bronco, Cadillac). Foliar Mg-applications significantly increased pod yield and, considering the highest rate with respect to the untreated, such an increase was 78 % and 32 % for Bronco and Cadillac, respectively. Split applications were also more effective, with yield increases of 109 % and 50 % for the two genotypes. Concerning quality, foliar Mg applications showed a significant effect particularly on sugars, calcium, phosphate, sulphate and Mg contents in pods. On the other hand, a significant effect on the accumulation of nitrates was noted, especially with split applications (144 % increase vs. unfertilised) and, in some cases, an antagonistic effect on K content (10 - 20 % decrease on average). Foliar Mg fertilisation of French bean seemed to be a promising practice with reference to human health and nutrition, tough some care is needed to avoid the accumulation of nitrates in pods.
