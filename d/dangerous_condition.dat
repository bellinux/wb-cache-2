5|$|Cooking oil is flammable, {{and fires}} {{may be caused}} by it igniting at too high a temperature. Further, {{attempts}} to extinguish an oil fire with water cause an extremely <b>dangerous</b> <b>condition,</b> a boilover, as they cause the water to flash into steam due to the high heat of the oil, in turn sending the burning oil in all directions and thus aggravating the fire. This {{is the leading cause of}} house fires in the United Kingdom. Instead, oil fires must be extinguished with a non-water fire extinguisher or by smothering. Other means of extinguishing an oil fire include application of dry powder (e.g., baking soda, salt) or fire fighting foam. Most commercial deep fryers are equipped with automatic fire suppression systems using foam.|$|E

25|$|The ground's second Test match began against England on 13 February 2009.

The sandy nature of the outfield earnt the ground the nickname of 'Antigua's 366th beach' in the buildup to the game. The abandonment caused great embarrassment for West Indies cricket, with inquests held by the WICB and the ICC.|$|E

25|$|The first Whirlwind {{was written}} off on 7 August when Pilot Officer McDermott had a tyre blow out while taking off in P6966. In {{spite of this}} {{he managed to get}} the {{aircraft}} airborne. Flying Control advised him of the <b>dangerous</b> <b>condition</b> of his undercarriage. PO McDermott bailed out of the aircraft between Grangemouth and Stirling. The aircraft dived in and buried itself eight feet into the ground. On recent inspection of the salvaged wreck of P6966, it was noticed that the defective tyre fitted was not of the correct size for a Whirlwind. Instead, it was the correct size for a Hurricane which 263 Squadron was also flying.|$|E

There are some <b>dangerous</b> <b>conditions</b> like gusts and downbursts which may occur rarely in service life of aircraft, though, aircraft must be tested for these <b>dangerous</b> <b>conditions.</b> This flight control system is capable of providing the failure identification and detection during landing.

25|$|The {{pivoting}} {{part that}} supports the cylinder is called the crane; it is the weak point of swing-out cylinder designs. Using the method often portrayed in movies and television of flipping the cylinder open and closed {{with a flick of}} the wrist can in fact cause the crane to bend over time, throwing the cylinder out of alignment with the barrel. Lack of alignment between chamber and barrel is a <b>dangerous</b> <b>condition,</b> as it can impede the bullet's transition from chamber to barrel. This gives rise to higher pressures in the chamber, bullet damage, and the potential for an explosion if the bullet becomes stuck.|$|E
25|$|Renewable fuses (rewirable or cartridge) allow user replacement, {{but this}} can be {{hazardous}} as {{it is easy to}} put a higher-rated or double fuse element (link or wire) into the holder (overfusing), or simply fitting it with copper wire or even a totally different type of conducting object (coins, hairpins, paper clips, nails, etc.) to the existing carrier. One form of fuse box abuse was to put a penny in the socket, which defeated overcurrent protection and resulted in a <b>dangerous</b> <b>condition.</b> Such tampering will not be visible without full inspection of the fuse. Fuse wire was never used in North America for this reason, although renewable fuses continue to be made for distribution boards.|$|E
25|$|Two- and four-pole {{breakers}} {{are used}} {{when there is}} a need to disconnect multiple phase AC, or to disconnect the neutral wire to ensure that no current flows through the neutral wire from other loads connected to the same network when workers may touch the wires during maintenance. Separate circuit breakers must never be used for live and neutral, because if the neutral is disconnected while the live conductor stays connected, a <b>dangerous</b> <b>condition</b> arises: the circuit appears de-energized (appliances don't work), but wires remain live and some residual-current devices (RCDs) may not trip if someone touches the live wire (because some RCDs need power to trip). This is why only common trip breakers must be used when neutral wire switching is needed.|$|E

25|$|In 1901, W. Monk Gibbon, {{founder of}} the first Boys’ Brigade Company in Dublin while a curate at St. Mattias in 1890, was {{appointed}} as rector. Gibbon would serve for over 34 years, becoming a canon of Christ Church Cathedral in 1923. He founded a Dundrum Company of the Boys’ Brigade also, which was replaced in 1922 by troops of Boy Scouts (SAI, now Scouting Ireland) and Girl Guides. 1901 also saw {{the establishment of the}} local branch of the Mothers' Union. The school was extended in 1905. In 1909, services in St. Nahi's Church were suspended due to the <b>dangerous</b> <b>condition</b> of the roof, which had to be replaced. The rector led much other restoration work on the old church also, including making of new flooring and seats, with main rebuilding completed in 1910.|$|E
25|$|It {{is illegal}} to drive a {{non-exempt}} vehicle that requires a test on public roads without a current MOT, except when driving to or from (subject to insurance terms and conditions) a booked MOT Test or to have remedial work done to rectify failures in a previous test. Possession of an up-to-date VT20 test certificate is a pre-requisite for obtaining Vehicle excise duty, and advertisements for used cars frequently say how many months are left to run on the current MOT (i.e., VT20 certificate; although the VT20 points out that it does not, in any way, guarantee road-worthiness {{at the time of}} sale). A vehicle could suffer major damage after an MOT has been carried out, but the certificate would still be valid, and obtaining a new one is not required by law (some insurance companies may require a new test, but this is their practice, not law). However, driving a vehicle which is in a <b>dangerous</b> <b>condition</b> on a public road is always illegal, irrespective of its test status.|$|E
25|$|Dunollie Castle near Oban, Argyll. There are now {{the remains}} of a strong but ruinous tower and other {{buildings}} that are overgrown. The site has actually been fortified {{since the days of the}} kings of Dál Riata in the sixth and seventh centuries. The present castle was built by the MacDougalls of Lorn. The Brooch of Lorn, which is said to have been captured from Robert the Bruce by the MacDougalls was kept at Dunollie Castle. The castle was attacked by Argyll, chief of Clan Campbell in 1644 and in 1647 it was besieged by a Covenanter army under General David Leslie, in which in the castle was sacked and burnt. During the Jacobite rising of 1715 the castle was attacked again when the MacDougalls supported the Stewarts and as a result the lands were forfeited. However the lands were restored in 1745 and in 1746 the MacDougalls built nearby Dunollie House, although there was an earlier house there dating from about 1600, and the old castle was abandoned. The castle is now in a <b>dangerous</b> <b>condition</b> but is still owned by the MacDougalls.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of RCDs that need a power supply, a <b>dangerous</b> <b>condition</b> can arise if the neutral wire is broken or {{switched}} off {{on the supply side}} of the RCD, while the corresponding live wire remains uninterrupted. The tripping circuit needs power to work and does not trip when the power supply fails. Connected equipment will not work without a neutral, but the RCD cannot protect people from contact with the energized wire. For this reason circuit breakers must be installed in a way that ensures that the neutral wire cannot be switched off unless the live wire is also switched off at the same time. Where there is a requirement for switching off the neutral wire, two-pole breakers (or four-pole for 3-phase) must be used. To provide some protection with an interrupted neutral, some RCDs and RCBOs are equipped with an auxiliary connection wire that must be connected to the earth busbar of the distribution board. This either enables the device to detect the missing neutral of the supply, causing the device to trip, or provides an alternative supply path for the tripping circuitry, enabling it to continue to function normally {{in the absence of the}} supply neutral.|$|E
500|$|Whatever the cause, the {{subsequent}} conflagration was {{hot enough to}} melt the cathedral's bells and the lead covering the wooden spire [...] "poured down like lava upon the roof", destroying it.

Queen Elizabeth contributed towards the cost of repairs and the Bishop of London Edmund Grindal gave £1200, although the spire was never rebuilt.

The work had to be repeated, and then done for a third time in the closed season. The postponement of an FA Cup-tie in January 2009 highlighted the lack of under-soil heating, which was installed in June. In 2017 the surface was converted to use the SISGrass hybrid grass reinforced turf system.|$|E
