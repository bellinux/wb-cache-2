5000|$|The {{fact that}} smoke calms bees {{has been known}} since ancient times; however, the {{scientific}} explanation was unknown until the 20th century and is still not fully understood. Smoke masks alarm pheromones which include various chemicals, e.g., <b>isopentyl</b> <b>acetate</b> that are released by guard bees or bees that are injured during a beekeeper's inspection. The smoke creates {{an opportunity for the}} beekeeper to open the beehive and work while the colony's defensive response is interrupted. In addition, smoke initiates a feeding response in anticipation of possible hive abandonment due to fire. When a bee consumes honey the bee's abdomen distends, making it difficult to make the necessary flexes to sting. (The latter has always been the primary explanation of the smoker's effect, since this behavior of bees is easily observable.) ...|$|E

Defensive behaviors, as follows: a) attraction to scent source, b) elevation of wings in "V", c) abdomen elevation, d) abdomen elevation and pumping and e) first leg pair elevation had been temporarily registered when the following compounds were presented: isoamyl alcohol, octyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, n-butyl acetate, n-octyl acetate, <b>isopentyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> benzyl acetate and 2 -heptanone. The results were as follows: 1. the bees elicited some characteristic behaviors when chemical alarm messages were presented, 2. agression (stinging) was not completed with any compound tested, probably {{because there was}} not a target (visual stimulus), 3. in all situations the attraction to scent source was low, 4. all the behaviors were elicited in a temporarily different way, 5. the compounds that elicited stronger responses and a greater number of the investigated behaviors were: <b>isopentyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> 2 -heptanone, octyl acetate and n-octyl alcohol. In all situations, the first behavior response (and the most intense one) was the elevation and pumping the abdomen. This suggests that the chemical message was promptly recognized and then transmitted to each worker. So, the results obtained in the present work, suggest that chemical alarm messages may be recognized by different mechanisms of neural integration...|$|E

A comparison of the volatile profile of commercial dried figs from Turkey was also reported. Forty-two volatile compounds were identified in Dottato figs by SPMEGC/MS, while 55 were identified in Turkish figs. Aldehydes were the main chemical class, while ethyl alcohol, isopentyl alcohol, <b>isopentyl</b> alcohol <b>acetate,</b> ethyl acetate, 3 -mehtylbutanal, hexanal and benzaldehyde were the major compounds in both fresh and dried Dottato figs. PCA explained 76. 5 % of the observed variance, allowing discrimination between Cilento and Turkish dried figs, and even between sun-dried and oven-treated samples. Oven treatment of Dottato figs significantly affected its volatile profile, while fig pollination is also hypothesized to have an influence.

40|$|Cilento (Southern Italy) white figs {{that belong}} to {{cultivar}} Dottato are used for production of Protected Denomination of Origin Cilento white figs, which have important economical significance in the production area. This paper reports {{for the first time}} the volatile composition of this typical Italian fig, in comparison to Turkish dried figs of the cultivar Smirne, and Greek dried figs of the cultivars Evia and Kalamata. 73 volatile compounds were identified and semi-quantified by SPME-GC/MS. The most represented chemical classes were alcohols, esters, aldehydes, ketones, terpenes and furans. Ethanol, isopentyl alcohol, <b>isopentyl</b> alcohol <b>acetate,</b> ethyl acetate, 3 -mehtylbutanal, hexanal and benzaldehyde were the most abundant compounds. A clear distinction was obtained by applying PCA on volatile dataset among figs from different origins and some marked differences were found in the distribution of volatile compounds by chemical classes. The thermal treatment applied to sun-dried Cilento figs caused significant changes in figs aroma profile. Fig pollination could be a significant factor in determining the aroma composition of fruits. PDO Cilento figs resulted clearly distinguishable from other dried figs. Their aromatic pattern seems to be strongly influenced by the thermal treatment during production. Dried Turkish and Greek figs cultivar Kalamata showed similar volatile profile. Fresh and dried figs are important components of the Mediterranean diet. In this paper we report the characterization of the phenolic compounds in 19 fig samples: 9 fresh figs belonging to the cultivar “Dottato” from Cilento (Italy), 10 dried fig samples from Cilento (2), Turkey (6), and Greece (2). The following phenolic compounds were identified and quantified by HPLC/UV-DAD: chlorogenic acid, protocatechuic acid, vanillic acid, luteolin- 3, 7 -di-O-glucoside, luteolin 7 -glucoside, apigenin- 7 - 0 -rutinoside, rutin, quercetin- 3 -glucoside and cyaniding- 3 - 0 -rutinoside. To our knowledge protocatechuic acid and vanillic acid are for the first time reported for figs. A discriminative analysis between the peel and pulp of the samples was carried out. The first crop (“breba”) and the second one (full crop) from Cilento figs were considered, as well as the effect of fig pollination. The majority of the phenolic compounds were predominant in the fig peel. Significant quantitative differences were found among fresh figs, whereas some qualitative differences were obtained between fresh and dried figs from the same origin in cultivar Dottato, and among dried figs from different origins. Breba crop resulted richer in phenols compared to figs of the second crop. Considering the dried figs, the Turkish ones had the highest concentration in phenolics...|$|R
40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out to isolate, identify, and to characterize, major {{volatile}} components of tomato fruit. Simultaneously, the confirmation was extended to the reported tomato volatiles. The volatile extracts from field- and artificially - ripe fruits were compared qualitatively as well as quantitatively. The changes which occurred in the volatile components of the fruit {{at the onset of}} senescence also were delineated. A typical chromatogram from field-ripe tomatoes contained 60 peaks. The functional group properties of individual peaks were derived by chemical analysis. The short-chain (C 3 -C 6) alcohols represented 10 per cent, aldehydes and ketones 32 per cent, and hydrocarbons, long-chain alcohols, and esters were in 58 per cent of the total amount of the volatiles from the field-ripe fruits. Among alcohols and carbonyls, 3 -pantanol, 1 -nonanal, 1 -decanal, and 1 -dodecanal and among esters, propyl acetate, geranyl acetate, and cetronellyl butyrate were tentatively identified as volatile compounds of tomato fruit. Linalyl acetate, citronellyl butyrate, and geranyl butyrate were identified {{for the first time as}} the components of tomato volatiles. Comparisons of volatile concentrations of field- and artificially - ripe tomatoes were made. IN the latter category of fruits the concentrations of 1 -butanol, 3 -pentanol, 2 -methyl- 3 -hexanol, 3 -methyl-butanal, 2, 3 -butanedione, propyl <b>acetate,</b> <b>isopentyl</b> butyrate, and other unidentified carbonyls were higher than those observed in the field-ripe fruits. These short-chain compounds, especially the C 4 -C 6 moities, probably are formed in their maximum concentrations during the early stages of maturation. Under the conditions of restricted nutrient availability, sun light, and limited enzymatic activity during artificial ripening, the long-chain compounds are not sunthesized appreciably. The concentrations of some of these short-chain compounds may be to a level of masking the effects of more desirable compounds contributory to ripe tomato aroma. Notably, a pulp from the artificially ripe fruits lacked the characteristic ripe tomato aroma. The concentrations of the long-chain carbonyls and the terpene esters were low in the artificially ripe tomatoes as compared to the field-ripe ones. This may indicate major contribution of these compounds to ripe tomato aroma. An attempt has been made to theorize the mechanisms of the biogenesis of these components of tomato volatiles. The concentrations of the volatiles from field-ripe and overripe tomatoes were compared. During overripening the amounts of alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, acetates, and propionates generally decreased. However, the concentrations of diacetyl and butyric acid esters increased. It was assumed that at the onset of senescence the metabolic pathways for the formation of diacetyl and butyric acid were highly operative in tomato fruit. The mechanisms of these pathways were postulated...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissemination}} of information is a basic element of group cohesion. In honey bees (Apis mellifera Linnaeus 1758), like in other social insects, the principal method for colony-wide information exchange is communication via pheromones. This medium of communication allows multiple individuals to conduct tasks critical to colony survival. Social signaling also establishes conflict {{at the level of}} the individual who must trade-off between attending to the immediate environment or the social demand. In this study we examined this conflict by challenging highly social worker honey bees, and less social male drone honey bees undergoing aversive training by presenting them with a social stress signal (<b>isopentyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> IPA). We utilized IPA exposure methods that caused lower learning performance in appetitive learning in workers. Exposure to <b>isopentyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (IPA) did not affect performance of drones and had a dose-specific effect on worker response, with positive effects diminishing at higher IPA doses. The IPA effects are specific because non-social cues, such as the odor cineole, improve learning performance in drones, and social homing signals (geraniol) did not have a discernible effect on drone or worker performance. We conclude that social signals do generate conflict and that response to them is dependent on signal relevance to the individual as well as the context. We discuss the effect of social signal on learning both related to its social role and potential evolutionary history...|$|E

We provide the first evidence for olfactory eavesdropping and avoidance of heterospecific alarm signals, alarm pheromones, at food sources in bees. We predicted that foragers could eavesdrop upon heterospecific alarm pheromones, and would detect and avoid conspicuous individual pheromone compounds, defined by abundance {{and their ability to}} persist. We show that Apis cerana foragers avoid the distinctive alarm pheromones of A. dorsata and A. mellifera, species that share the same floral resources and predators. We next examined responses to individual alarm pheromone compounds. Apis cerana foragers avoided <b>isopentyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (IPA), which is found in all three species and is the most abundant and volatile of the tested compounds. Interestingly, A. cerana also avoided an odor component, gamma-octanoic lactone (GOL), which is > 150 -fold less volatile than IPA. Chemical analyses confirmed that GOL is only present in A. dorsata, not in A. cerana. Electroantennogram (EAG) recordings revealed that A. cerana antennae are 10 -fold more sensitive to GOL than to other tested compounds.

Analysis of the mass spectrum and subsequent synthesis confirmed that this compound is 3 -methyl- 2 -buten- 1 -yl acetate (3 M 2 BA), an unsaturated derivative of IPA. In Africanized honeybees, sampling from stings of guards showed that 3 M 2 BA was present at levels of 0 – 38 % the amount of isoamyl acetate (IPA). Behavioral assays from three colonies each of Africanized and European bees showed that 3 M 2 BA recruited worker bees from hives of both Africanized bees and European bees at least as efficiently as <b>isopentyl</b> <b>acetate</b> IPA, a compound widely reported to have the highest activity for releasing alarm and stinging behavior in honeybees.

40|$|In honeybees, {{associative}} learning {{is embedded in}} a social context as bees possess a highly complex social organization in which communication among individuals is mediated by dance behavior informing about food sources, and by a high variety of pheromones that maintain the social links between individuals of a hive. Proboscis extension response (PER) conditioning {{is a case of}} appetitive learning, in which harnessed bees learn to associate odor stimuli with sucrose reward in the laboratory. Despite its recurrent use as a tool for uncovering the behavioral, cellular and molecular bases underlying {{associative learning}}, the question of whether social signals (pheromones) affect appetitive learning has not been addressed in this experimental framework. This situation contrasts with reports underlining that foraging activity of bees is modulated by alarm pheromones released {{in the presence of a}} potential danger. Here, we show that appetitive learning is impaired by the sting alarm pheromone (SAP) which, when released by guards, recruits foragers to defend the hive. This effect is mimicked by the main component of SAP, <b>isopentyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (IPA), is dose-dependent and lasts up to 24 h. Learning impairment is specific to alarm signal exposure and is independent of the odorant used for conditioning. Our results suggest that learning impairment may be a response to the biological significance of SAP as an alarm signal, which would detract bees from responding to any appetitive stimuli in a situation in which such responses would be of secondary importance...|$|E
40|$|In Southeast Asia {{the native}} honey bee species Apis cerana is often {{attacked}} by hornets (Vespa velutina), {{mainly in the}} period from April to November. During the co-evolution of these two species honey bees have developed several strategies to defend themselves such as learning the odors of hornets and releasing alarm components to inform other mates. However, so far {{little is known about}} whether and how honey bees modulate their olfactory learning {{in the presence of the}} hornet predator and alarm components of honey bee itself. In the present study, we test for associative olfactory learning of A. cerana in the presence of predator odors, the alarm pheromone component <b>isopentyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (IPA), or a floral odor (hexanal) as a control. The results show that bees can detect live hornet odors, that there is almost no association between the innately aversive hornet odor and the appetitive stimulus sucrose, and that IPA is less well associated with an appetitive stimulus when compared with a floral odor. In order to imitate natural conditions, e. g. when bees are foraging on flowers and a predator shows up, or alarm pheromone is released by a captured mate, we tested combinations of the hornet odor and floral odor, or IPA and floral odor. Both of these combinations led to reduced learning scores. This study aims to contribute to a better understanding of the prey-predator system between A. cerana and V. velutina...|$|E

The effects of ingested biogenic amine precursors 5 -hydroxytryptophan, L-DOPA and tryptophan were tested on three variables measurable from the sound traces: onset of the buzzing response after presentation of the pheromone stimulus, {{the duration of the}} buzzing event, and the maximal sound frequency produced during the buzzing event. Bees fed high doses of 5 -hydroxytrytophan were found to react significantly more slowly and with a significantly lower maximum frequency than bees that were only fed sucrose controls. Bees fed DOPA were no different from controls for any of the variables measured, and bees fed tryptophan were so hyperactive that reliable responses to the presentation of alarm pheromone could not be made. Finally, the brains of worker bees fed these different precursors were examined for content of various neurochemicals. Bees fed 5 -hydroxytryptophan were found to have dose-dependent elevations of both 5 -hydroxytryptophan and serotonin within their brains. Bees fed tryptophan were found to have dose-dependent elevations of tryptophan and kynurenine in the brain but no change in brain serotonin. Bees fed DOPA had dose-dependent increases in DOPA and dopamine levels within their brains. These results suggest that the hyperactive condition results from kynurenine metabolism, and the reduced response to alarm pheromone is related to serotonin metabolism...|$|E
40|$|Yeast {{are used}} as workhorses to convert hopped wort into beer. Conventionally, such yeasts belong to the genus Saccharomyces and most {{research}} on fermentation of wort {{for the production of}} beer has focussed on the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces pastorianus. Recently, there is an increasing interest in unravelling features of non-conventional yeast species for beer innovation. In this thesis, features of yeast isolates belonging to the species: Cyberlindnera fabianii, Pichia kudriavzevii and S. cerevisiae (all isolated from fermented masau (Ziziphus mauritiana) fruits in Zimbabwe), were studied with focus on aroma production. Additionally, a novel approach was used to apply these yeasts in co-cultivation with Brewers’ yeast (S. cerevisiae) for beer innovation. The characteristics and quality of the beer are mainly determined by aroma compounds in the final product such as esters, alcohols, aldehydes and acids. Yeast use various metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the fermentative pathway, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the Ehrlich pathway to produce aroma compounds or the precursors for the synthesis thereof (Chapter 1). Among the aroma compounds, esters are of major importance, especially since they are perceived by the human olfactory system at very low concentrations. In general, esters are desirable compounds in beers due to their fruity flavour. Examples are isoamyl acetate (banana), isobutyl acetate (fruity, sweet), phenylethyl acetate (rose, apple, honey), ethyl acetate (sweet pear), ethyl hexanoate (apple, aniseed) and ethyl octanoate (sour apple). Together with an extensive range of other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) these compounds were previously profiled using headspace solid-phase-micro-extraction gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry (GCMS). Interestingly, comparative profiling of aromas showed that C. fabianii produces significantly higher amounts of isoamyl acetate and ethyl acetate compared to S. cerevisiae.   It has been suggested in literature that products of the Ehrlich pathway, so called “fusel alcohols”, can function as signalling molecules for invasive growth upon nitrogen limitation. This suggested that nutrient limitation could affect growth performance and production of aroma compounds. Therefore, in Chapter 2, the metabolic and morphological response of S. cerevisiae, C. fabianii and P. kudriavzevii was analysed upon nitrogen and/or glucose limitation on semi-solid (agar) media. All three yeasts showed a change in growth mode upon nitrogen and/or glucose limitation. Scanning electron microscopy was used to unravel the cell organisation of C. fabianii and P. kudriavzevii grown under nitrogen limitation. This revealed the power of cell-cell adhesion for penetrative growth and the formation of meta-filaments or pseudo-hyphae to extend the cell surface area. Such changes in growth mode may be of relevance for solid-state fermentation processes, such as fruit fermentations,  by enhanced substrate penetration of yeast. Notably, a significant  increase in the production of esters (ethyl acetate, ethyl propanoate, isobutyl acetate and <b>isopentyl</b> <b>acetate)</b> by C. fabianii and P. kudriavzevii was found under conditions of nitrogen limitation. Understanding the relationship between nitrogen limitation and ester formation gives more insight into the ability to steer ester formation by nutrient availability in wort fermentations. The amount and type of esters are important determinants of the final flavour characteristics of the beer. Therefore, the diversity in ester production between the three yeast species was investigated by studying enzymatic reactions involved in the production (synthesis) of esters and their degradation (hydrolysis) and to link this to volatile organic compound profiles (Chapter 3). The amount and type of esters depends on substrate availability and a combination of enzyme activities supporting the synthesis and hydrolysis of the different esters formed. Esters are generally formed by a condensation reaction of an alcohol with ac(et) yl CoA by a so-called alcohol acetyltranferase (AATse). The products formed  can generally be subdivided into two groups; acetate esters and medium chain fatty acid (MCFA) esters. Alcohols are formed by reduction of aldehydes by alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH) using either the fermentative or Ehrlich pathway. Comparative analysis of the specific ADHs and acetate ester hydrolysing activity and subsequently linking these data with the distinct aroma profiles of the three yeasts revealed that the acetate ester hydrolysing activity is a key step in determining the final pool size of acetate esters found in the fermentation broths (Chapter 3). Under the experimental conditions, C. fabianii showed the lowest acetate ester hydrolysing activity correlating with higher extracellular levels of acetate esters indicating the suitability of this yeast for use in co-cultures with brewers’ yeast with the objective to enable the enrichment of acetate esters in the fermentation process (Chapters 4 and 5). Nowadays, there is large interest of consumers in specialty beers such as beers low in alcohol (health awareness) and/or richer is fruity flavours (specialty beers), and this has significantly stimulated the quest for new methods, practices and yeast strains to produce such beers. In chapter 4 an innovative approach is described using co-cultivations of brewers’ yeast and C. fabianii to steer wort fermentation performance. Various ratios of brewers’ yeast over C. fabianii were inoculated in wort. A dose response relationship was observed, where a higher initial dose of C. fabianii leads to lower alcohol production and a more complex aroma bouquet. Interestingly, specific esters, i. e. ethyl acetate (sweet pear), ethyl octanoate (sour apple), ethyl decanoate (waxy, sweet apple), ethyl 9 -decenoate (fruity, fatty) and ethyl dodecanoate (fruity, waxy), were found in higher levels in co-cultivation compared to both mono-cultivations indicating metabolic interactions. The reduced ethanol production in the co-culture could be explained by inhibition of Brewers’ yeast performance by C. fabianii in the co-cultivations. Further investigations revealed that this growth inhibition is caused by competition for oxygen between brewers’ yeast and C. fabianii. Depletion of oxygen caused inhibition of growth of brewers’ yeast since it needs oxygen to synthesize ergosterol that is required for cell membrane synthesis under anaerobic conditions (Chapter 4). The interaction between brewers’ yeast and C. fabianii in co-cultivation can be described using dynamic modelling (Chapter 5). A dynamic model was developed based on brewers’ yeast and C. fabianii in mono-cultivation and fitted to experimental data. The two models were combined and the same parameter settings were used to predict the fermentation outcome of brewers’ yeast and C. fabianii in co-cultivation. The model was experimentally validated using inoculation ratios of 1 : 10 and 1 : 100 brewers’ yeast over C. fabianii. Additionally, the use of dynamic modelling supported the hypothesis that competition for oxygen between brewers’ yeast and C. fabianii results in inhibition of brewers’ yeast fermentation performance. Interestingly, prediction of aroma formation in co-cultivation, especially that of specific esters, appeared to be more challenging due to metabolic interactions resulting in MCFA-esters contributing to fruity aromas, and this aspect requires further study. The results and findings obtained in the experimental chapters (Chapter 2 - 5) are further discussed in Chapter 6. Unravelling features of non-conventional yeast generates novel opportunities for beer innovation. Application of C. fabianii in co-cultivation with brewers’ yeast in wort fermentation offers a novel approach in product innovation resulting in low alcohol beers with enriched aroma bouquet. Finally, the developed dynamic model may be used to predict fermentation outcomes of brewers’ yeast with other non-conventional yeast species...|$|E
