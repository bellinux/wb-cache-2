The key {{actors in the}} value chain - <b>goat</b> <b>keepers,</b> feed suppliers, meat processors, government animal health agencies, and development organizations - decided to form an association called an 'innovation platform' to improve {{the functioning of the}} value chain. One innovation was for the feed suppliers to increase the supply of feed to rural areas during the feed-short dry season, which improved improved goat health and survival. Another was to build pens where the animals could be safely kept while being sold, reducing theft and streamlining the sales process. Auctions were also established to enable small-scale <b>goat</b> <b>keepers</b> to obtain market-competitive prices for their animals instead of losing out to middlemen at the farm gate. Today more than 85 % of sales of goats take place at auctions.

40|$|Brucellosis, a {{zoonotic}} disease particularly affecting goats, emerged in Thailand in 2003, resulting in both an occupational hazard for <b>goat</b> <b>keepers</b> and livestock officers, and production losses. Farm management practices {{have been identified}} as risk factors associated with Brucella sero-positivity in many studies. Our finding in this study should be considered in order to strengthen the system of biosecurity control in farm animals as one health approach. The objectives of the study were to describe the distribution of potential risk factors by types of goat farms and to document the prevalence of human Brucella sero-positivity among <b>goat</b> <b>keepers</b> and livestock officers in Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand. A cross-sectional study was conducted from September to December 2012. The study population included three types of goat farms: standard, community enterprise and private goat farms that were located in Nakhon Si Thammmarat Province in southern Thailand. Information on whether the farm had any Brucella sero-positivity goats since 2011 was retrieved from the local livestock office records. Information on farming management was also traced back to 2011. Field researchers collected information from <b>goat</b> <b>keepers</b> of the selected farms using a structured questionnaire. <b>Goat</b> <b>keepers</b> on all farms pre-identified (January to June 2012) as having had at least one positive goat were considered to have been exposed. <b>Goat</b> <b>keepers</b> on a random sample of farms having all goats with negative results were considered to be unexposed. Venous blood samples were collected from <b>goat</b> <b>keepers</b> exposed and unexposed and from livestock officers and the samples were tested by IgG ELISA. Statistical analysis was done under the complex survey design in R software. Fourteen standard farms, 66 community enterprise farms and 68 private farms participated in the study; 82. 4 % (122 / 148) used public pasture and 53. 4 % (79 / 148) shared breeder goats with other farms. Farm management practices corresponding to pre-identified risk factors were more common in private farms. Large herd size (≥ 51 goats) and having dogs and/or rats on the farm were significantly associated with Brucella infection in animals (P <  0. 05). Similar proportions of <b>goat</b> <b>keepers</b> in positive <b>goat</b> farm and livestock officers were positive for Brucella antibody (8. 3 % and 8. 8 % respectively). Several goat farming management practices in the study area may increase the risk of Brucella infection in animals. Livestock officers in the area have a high risk of being infected with Brucella.

40|$|The European Commission-funded project, Small {{ruminant}} value chains as platforms {{for reducing}} poverty and increasing food security in dryland areas of India and Mozambique (imGoats) aims to increase incomes and food security in a sustainable manner by enhancing pro-poor small ruminant value chains in India and Mozambique. The project is {{implemented by the}} International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) in collaboration with BAIF Development Research Foundation in India and CARE Mozambique. The project uses innovation platforms as a participatory way of identifying and testing interventions aimed at increasing smallholder goat productivity. In Mozambique, the innovation platform identified communal pasture areas {{as one of the}} interventions to increase goat production. Each project community identified one or two areas for communal grazing of goats. However, setting up of communal pasture areas and managing them sustainably requires attention to several technical and social aspects, for example, dealing with overgrazing, community agreements and overall management. Because the extension officers from CARE Mozambique did not have adequate knowledge and expertise in this area, imGoats technical consultant Michaela Cosijn and ILRI postdoctoral scientist Birgit Boogaard designed and conducted a 1. 5 -day training course on communal pasture areas for CARE extension officers. The content of the course was largely based on an MSc thesis entitled Creation of communal grazing areas for goats in southern Mozambique: Future perspectives by Wageningen University student Yvane Marblé (available online at [URL] This manual is an output of the training course and was prepared by a team of researchers from ILRI in collaboration with technical staff from CARE Mozambique and Yvane Marblé.

The former villages were higher in the mountain at the edge of the natural forest usually where water could be obtained by digging gullies deep into the mountains to catch the water. Behind Abades “red mountain”, a small harbour, the “enseñada de Abades” which was primarily used to ship the red stones from the local quarry to other islands as far as Cuba as wells as for local fishermen. <b>Goat</b> <b>keepers</b> used to live in natural caves after the few winter rainfalls, then headed back to Arico during the long dry season.

Between 1978 and 1986, this place was named “Los Abriguitos” and many wooden hutments were built to host the new tourists. In 1986, all wooden hutments were burnt and the Abades project started with a wall facing the sea.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that goats {{in developing countries}} fulfill multiple functions and can contribute to improved livelihoods of smallholders. The multi-functionality of goats in rural Mozambique however is fairly unknown. The objective of the paper is therefore to identify and create {{a deeper understanding of}} the multiple functions goats currently play in the smallholders sector in Mozambique. The paper takes a sociological approach by advancing the thinking that the functions of goats are socially and culturally constructed, and not ‘given’. Qualitative data were collected by means of historical timelines in six communities and individual in-depth interviews with 18 smallholder <b>goat</b> <b>keepers</b> (three per community) in Inhassoro district, Inhambane province. In addition, findings of the quantitative baseline household survey (n= 83) were used. Results showed four categories of goat functions in Inhassoro district, based on respondents’ perspectives: 1) sale in times of need, 2) exchange for services and products, 3) social life, and 4) consumption. Based on these findings, the paper discusses implications of the multi-functionality of goats for development projects, in which goats can function as financial saving and insurance, as contributors to food security, as contributors to social capital, and as commercial production commodities. Subsequently, the paper addresses a few fundamental questions about projects aiming to commercialize smallholder goat keeping, i. e. linking smallholders to markets.

A household survey was conducted with 311 farmers participating in three dairy goat projects (Dairy Goat Association of Kenya (DGAK), Higher Education Links-Egerton University Community Dairy Goats Project (HEL-EUCDGP) and Heifer Project International (HPI)) to assess farmers' willingness to pay for provision of these services. Ranking these services revealed that MS {{was the most important}} service in priority order for <b>goat</b> <b>keepers.</b> Farmers with and without experience were willing to pay significantly more for provision of VS. Variables such as satisfaction with project activities, system of production, social benefits, flock size, participation in the projects, farm visits, market linkage and information, and experiences on the services significantly influenced willingness to pay (WTP). The decision to pay or not was not necessarily affected by those not willing to pay because of the inter-linkage probabilities with the ability to pay. Projects should take a broader responsibility of providing these services or link farmers to agents to provide the services.

The water access also largely determines the availability of food for people and feed for animals. The {{aim of this study}} was to survey the affect of water access on milk production from dairy animals. The study included nineteen farm visits that were made in the Nyando district in Kenya between February and Mars 2011. Farm visits included interviews with questions about for example number of dairy animals, milk production, water access, feed and water routines. Visual and practical measurements were performed.

30|$|To better {{understand}} {{the relative importance of}} the multi-purpose functions of small ruminants for their urban owners and related breeding practices including selection criteria, we undertook a comparative analysis across the West African cities of Kano (Nigeria), Bobo Dioulasso (Burkina Faso) and Sikasso (Mali). Semi-structured questionnaires were used to collect the required information from 301 sheep farmers (100, 102 and 99 in Kano, Bobo Dioulasso and Sikasso) and 306 goat farmers (100, 99 and 107 in Kano, Bobo Dioulasso and Sikasso). Sheep and goats were kept {{for a variety of reasons}} including income generation, insurance (sale for cash to meet unexpected expenditures) and economic security (sale for cash to support foreseeable expenses), social/religious functions and prestige in ownership. The relative importance given by respondents to the different functions varied significantly (p <  0.001) across cities and between species within a city. However, irrespective of city, both species were primarily kept for their financial functions whereby sheep were perceived as having higher economic value. Although breeding practices were very similar in many respects (low practice of castration, culling and replacement strategies, uncontrolled mating, no record keeping and selection criteria), the emphasis put on each selection criteria varied across cities and between species. Irrespective of city, most of the goats were of the indigenous type while keeping crossbred animals and/or maintaining more than one genotype in the same flock was more commonly practiced by sheep keepers. This points to a higher motivation for strategic breeding among sheep than <b>goat</b> <b>keepers</b> and indicates that the former might be interested in joining carefully designed participatory flock improvement programs.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} farmers’ preferences for goat breeds, desired traits, management and breeding practices in agro-pastoral communities {{of central and eastern}} Tanzania. A total of 552 <b>goat</b> <b>keepers</b> from semi-arid and sub-humid areas were involved. Information on goat flock size, breed preferences, breeding practices, traits preferred and husbandry practices was collected using a well structured questionnaire. Out of the 552 household heads, only 21. 3 % were women. Most of the farmers kept indigenous goats belonging to the Small East African breed and the mean number of goats per household was 8. 9 ± 1. 0. The majority of the farmers (53. 4 %) preferred to keep the Small East African goat breed rather than the exotic breeds. The Small East African breed was preferred to exotic breeds because the animals are easier to feed, prolific, tolerant to drought and endemic diseases. Most farmers (70. 8 %) practiced uncontrolled mating using bucks from either their own flock (66. 7 %) or neighbours’ flocks (33. 3 %). Uncontrolled mating was preferred because it is easier to practice (41. 2 %) and cheaper (41. 2 %). The buck to doe ratio was 1 : 3 in semi-arid and 1 : 2 in sub-humid areas. Breeding males were selected based on body size by the majority (85 %) of the goat farmers. It is concluded that livestock keepers in semi-arid and sub-humid areas in Tanzania prefer the Small East Africa goats because the animals are abundantly available and well adapted to the local environmental conditions.

Phenotypic characters of 534 Abergelle and 476 Western Lowland goats were measured. Genetic diversity of the two Ethiopian and three Nigerian goat types were assessed based on 47 K Single Nucleotide Polymorphism markers. The breeding objective traits were investigated through own and group animals ranking experiments. Community based one tier breeding schemes with four different alternatives for the top three most important traits were simulated. The survey results indicated that goats were kept for multifunctional roles in both areas. Phenotypic characterization showed high variability within and between the studied breeds in qualitative and quantitative traits. Western Lowland goats are on an average not only bigger than Abergelle goats but also show considerably higher variation in body size. The genetic diversity analysis revealed that the studied goat populations were well differentiated based on their geographical location. Production and reproduction traits such as body size, twinning and milk yield were identified as important breeding objective traits in own flock ranking experiment while in group ranking experiment the observable characters like body size, body conformation and coat color were identified as breeding goal traits. Simulation results gave an acceptable range of genetic gains with little difference across the alternatives.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to describe the production environment and production systems, characterize (phenotypic) and evaluate on-farm performances of Abergelle and Central Highland goat breeds. A total of 256 farmers in Ziquala (68), Tanqua Abergelle (70) and Lay- Armachiho (118) districts were interviewed for the household survey. Data for qualitative and quantitative characters were collected from a total of 640 4 PPI age category goats (143 from Ziquala and 183 from Tanqua Abergelle districts on Abergelle goat breed and 314 from Lay Armachiho district on Central Highland goat breed). Base flock, flock dynamics, birth and growth weight, milk yield data recordings were taken from mid July 2013 up to mid August 2014 for on-farm performance evaluation. Data collected through questionnaire (survey) were described by descriptive statistics using SPSS. Observations on qualitative traits were analyzed for male and female goats separately using frequency procedure of SAS. Whereas, quantitative traits were analyzed using the GLM procedures of SAS. Individual interviews and group discussions made in all of the three districts indicated that all of the farmers practiced both crop and livestock production. The first objective of keeping goat in all districts was to get cash income. Unlike Lay Armachiho district, all <b>goat</b> <b>keepers</b> in Ziquala and Tanqua Abergelle districts reported that they milk their goats. From the current survey result milk yield (mean±SD) /doe/day (liter) in the rainy and in the dry seasons in Ziquala district were 0. 43 ± 0. 24 and 0. 15 ± 0. 14 respectively. The corresponding values for Tanqua Abergelle district were 0. 48 ± 0. 24 and 0. 19 ± 0. 29 respectively. The actual on-farm milk yield (mean±SE) monitoring result in Ziquala district in wet and dry seasons were 285. 42 ± 5. 64 and 243. 12 ± 9. 92 milliliter/doe/day respectively. The corresponding values for Tanqua Abergelle district were 452. 68 ± 6. 15 and 362. 03 ± 9. 19 milliliter/doe/day respectively. Communal natural pasture and river water were the major sources of goat feeding and watering respectively both in dry and wet seasons {{in each of the three}} districts. Among the interviewed <b>goat</b> <b>keepers</b> in the study districts 97. 1 % in Ziquala, 98. 7 % in Tanqua Abergelle and 66. 8 % in Lay Armachiho had their own indigenous breeding male goat. Coat color, body conformation and growth rate were the first, second and third selection criteria for breeding buck respectively in Ziquala and Tanqua Abergelle districts. The corresponding values for Lay Armachiho district were body conformation, growth rate and coat color. The first preferred trait for does was milk yield in Ziquala and Tanqua Abergelle districts and body conformation in Lay Armachiho district. Drought, disease and feed shortage were the first, second and third major constraints respectively for goat production in Ziquala and Tanqua Abergelle districts. The corresponding values for Lay Armachiho district were disease, theft and predator. Majority of Abergelle goat coat color was brown/red (30. 40 %) and its combination with other coat colors (50. 61 %), whereas relatively high proportion of Central Highland goat had white coat color (21. 66) and its combination with other coat colors (55. 09 %). There were very high significant differences (at least P 0. 05) rump length and pelvic width. From all the measurements compared, Central Highland goat had higher values except rump length, pelvic width and horn length. In general, males showed higher measurements than females and the interaction between sex and breed significantly (at least p< 0. 05) affected all the parameters measured. Least square means (±SE) of body weight (kg) for Abergelle males and females at 4 PPI were 30. 75 ± 0. 60 and 24. 30 ± 0. 32 respectively. The corresponding values for Central Highland goats were 34. 79 ± 0. 73 and 33. 11 ± 0. 31 respectively. The average flock size per monitored households in Ziquala, Tanqua Abergelle and Lay Armachiho districts were 27. 33 ± 1. 88, 19. 18 ± 1. 32 and 13. 79 ± 9. 41 goats respectively. The overall least square means (±SE) for birth, three, six and nine month weights (kg) of Abergelle goat kids at Ziquala district monitoring site were 1. 98 ± 0. 06, 7. 30 ± 0. 21, 9. 25 ± 0. 31 and 11. 21 ± 0. 53 respectively. For the same breed at Tanqua Abergelle district monitoring site for the above age categories (in kg) were 1. 97 ± 0. 06, 7. 43 ± 0. 23, 11. 08 ± 0. 33 and 13. 24 ± 0. 55 respectively.

A study was undertaken in 215 randomly selected goat flocks of selected villages from the four agro-climatic zones viz., Eastern dry zone (EDZ), Central dry zone (CDZ), Southern dry zone (SDZ) and Southern transition zone (STZ) of Southern Karnataka in order to document the goat husbandry practices and socio-economic status of <b>goat</b> <b>keepers.</b> The flock size ranged from 27 to 40 which were not of any distinct breed. The average number of does, bucks and kids was 17. 48 ± 12. 77, 5. 62 ± 4. 63 and 8. 75 ± 5. 26, respectively, with the Does: Buck: Kids ratio being approximately 3 : 1 : 2. The landholdings of 1 - 2 acres and more than 2 acres were with 46. 05 per cent and 37. 21 per cent of the goat rearers respectively, while the remaining (16. 74 per cent) goat rearers were landless labourers. The goats were sheltered only during night in houses that were of kutcha type sheds constructed of locally available material (65 %) with mud flooring or in pucca type sheds (35 %) with half wall to the level of 2 - 3 ft on the sides with cement/concrete / stone paved for flooring. Dry fodder (Paddy/Ragi/Maize straw) was fed by only 18. 26 per cent of the rearers while majority (81. 74 %) of them were dependent on naturally available trees fodders to meet the roughage demand of the goats. All the farmers were aware of the essentiality of vaccination and deworming for which they depended on Goverenment Veterinary dispensaries. This study conducted {{for the first time in}} the study area gives an idea of the status of goat rearers which would help the policy makers and researchers to plan future goat improvement programmes...|$|R
30|$|Out of {{the total}} of 609 persons interviewed, 295 (48 %) kept both sheep and goats, 206 (34 %) kept only sheep and 108 (18 %) kept only goats. The {{proportion}} of people who kept both sheep and goats was significantly higher (p <  0.001) in Kano (67 %) than in Sikasso (46 %) and in Bobo Dioulasso (33). Keepers of only sheep were proportionally more numerous in Bobo Dioulasso and Sikasso (46 and 37 %, respectively) than in Kano (19 %), while <b>keepers</b> of only <b>goats</b> represented 22 % of respondents in Bobo Dioulasso against 16 and 15 % in Sikasso and Kano, respectively. Small ruminant keepers in all three cities were predominantly male, but the proportion of female keepers was significantly higher (p <  0.001) in Bobo Dioulasso (28 %) and Kano (17 %) than in Sikasso (5 %). The average age of keepers was 43  ±  12  years, but keepers in Kano were significantly (p <  0.001) younger (36  ±  9  years) than those in Bobo Dioulasso (46  ±  15  years) and Sikasso (49  ±  8  years). Within cities, {{no significant difference in}} gender and age of owners was noted between sheep and <b>goats</b> <b>keepers.</b> While overall most (73 %) of the small ruminant keepers had started this activity within the last 10  years, a significantly (p <  0.001) higher proportion of respondents had started this activity less than 5  years ago in Sikasso (33 %) and Bobo Dioulasso (31 %) as compared to Kano (4 %). The main occupation of small ruminant keepers varied significantly (p <  0.001) across cities. In Bobo Dioulasso they were mainly traders (26 %), people without any other income generating activity (20 %) and service providers (16 %). In Sikasso, they were mainly public/civil servants (32 %), traders (27 %) and service providers (17 %), whereas traders and services providers represented 40 and 24 %, respectively, of the keepers in Kano. Crop/vegetable farmers accounted for 15, 13 and 9 % of keepers in Bobo Dioulasso, Kano and Sikasso, respectively. Only 9 % of small ruminant keepers in Bobo Dioulasso against 1.5 and 2.4 % in Kano and Sikasso considered livestock keeping as their main occupation. Overall there was a significant (p <  0.001) relationship between the animal species kept and the main occupation of the keeper: crop/vegetable farmers tended to keep goats only or both sheep and goats, while people without any other income generating activity were more inclined to keep sheep only.|$|R
40|$|The role of {{livestock}} {{in rural communities}} is changing rapidly. Goats are increasingly used to augment cash income and enhance food security, thus serving as an important component in household’s livelihood strategies, particularly in drought-prone areas. While much {{has been done to}} improve agricultural production in the small-scale sector, little is known and documented about the current state of goat production and marketing in the communal areas of Zimbabwe. This report aims to set a baseline of the current status of goat production and marketing in southwestern Zimbabwe. The report illustrates the main functions of goats. Basic statistics describe goat ownership patterns with regard to the socioeconomic profi les of <b>goat</b> <b>keepers,</b> and the responsibilities of different household members in day-to-day goat management and marketing. The current productivity of goat fl ocks and seasonal trends are illustrated, indicating major challenges that farmers face in goat production and marketing. The report then provides {{a detailed description of the}} current management practices and existing marketing systems, and illustrates differences between districts, proximity to markets, flock sizes, levels of education and gender. Goat mortality has been found to be the most important constraint. Farmers with few goats are unable to sustain their fl ocks, whereas those with larger fl ocks do not realize the potential benefits from goats due to high mortality rates. Poor access to animal health support, dry season feed shortages and inadequate housing are the most important immediate factors contributing to high mortalities and can generally be ascribed to a lack of information and poor service structures, both resulting from limited support given to the small stock sector by government and NGO support services. The study also shows that although many farmers attempt to sell goats, markets are underdeveloped, infrastructure is inadequate and market information is not readily available. This results in poor confi dence in markets, high transaction costs and low prices for goats. It is hypothesized that improved market access will act as an incentive for farmers to invest more in goat production. Market development is thus singled out as the next important step in further developing the goat industry in Zimbabwe. Practical options to enhance the contribution of goats to food security and income growth are discussed, and priority interventions are recommended to service providers, development agents and policymakers in Zimbabwe...|$|R
40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} {{factors that affect}} the decision and extent of market participation. Data were collected from 357 households and 1030 goats that are marketed. Focus group discussion was conducted to point out households marketing strategies. The study attempted to see both supply and demand side issues in different angles. Since the likelihood ratio test of no selection-biasness indicates selectivity of households marketing behavior, ordered tobit selection model was employed to analyze determinants of market participation decision {{and the extent of}} participation. To this effect, the ordered probit and multiple linear model were estimated simultaneously using Full information maximum likelihood estimation. All factors that affect market participation decision except distance to market, goat owned, and price of goat determined the extent of participation of net buyers, autarkic and net sellers. Transaction costs had indispensable role on why commercialization of goat is limited. As from the main objective of <b>goat</b> <b>keepers</b> observed their <b>goat</b> production was not designed in a manner to promote commercialization of goat. They used goat as a sort of walking bank. Hedonic price model was employed to analyze consumer’s preference by fitting the revealed data. Implicit price analysis using ordinary least square estimation resulted estimates with standard errors that are heteroscedastic. As a result the study employed alternative robust estimation methods and based on Akaike, Bayesian and log-likelihood criteria of model selection, the modified structural heteroscedastic-in-mean is more appropriate for examining implicit price function. Goat markets were in-competitive. The common animal attributes had an impact on price of goat. However, animal attributes demanded by local and export market were different. Occasion had generally significant influence on price of goat. Goat marketed during festive periods in general and festive period that have an international demand in particular commands high price. Using revealed data, it was difficult to capture the influence of breed on price of goat. Empirical results regressed using those models as well as qualitative analysis of focus group discussion was consistent especially regarding marketing behavior of households. That is the negative sign of price risk premium shows that net sellers are not responsive to the change in price implying sellers that opt to sell are somewhat more desperate for cash. This is also in line with marketing strategies of households. The study mainly recommended improving access to information to promote both market participation and market orientation...|$|R
30|$|Both {{sheep and}} goats seemed to be {{selected}} {{based on the same}} individual physical traits in all three locations. However, the emphasis put on each trait varied across cities and between species, reflecting differences in production objectives as mentioned above. Of particular note is the higher emphasis put on coat color in Sikasso compared to Bobo Dioulasso and Kano. Although certain beliefs regarding raising and/or eating meat of animals of certain coat colour are widespread across many West African societies (Brisebarre and Kuczynski 2009) and elsewhere in Africa (Gwaze et al. 2009), they were remarkably more pronounced among respondents in Sikasso compared to the two other cities and could be explained by cultural differences. The integration of animals into the traditional beliefs was not quantified in the current study because most respondents avoided mentioning this aspect. When selecting female replacement animals {{on the basis of their}} mother’s characteristics, farmers showed a strong preference for productivity traits such as fertility and prolificacy irrespective of species and city. This reflects the farmers’ general objective which is to increase flock size and overall flock productivity. It is noteworthy that the mother’s ability to resist diseases and parasites, which is an adaptive trait, was more frequently reported and ranked higher by goat than by sheep farmers. This is probably related to higher mortality rates in goats than in sheep, especially in Sikasso. Although, with the exception of Bobo Dioulasso, breed was ranked least by both sheep and goat farmers, a considerable high proportion of sheep farmers (Figure  1) tended to keep animals of improved genotypes, mainly crossbred, in Sikasso and Bobo Dioulasso; alternatively several genotypes were kept in the same flock (Kano and Bobo Dioulasso). In contrast, goats were mostly of local genotypes irrespective of city. This remarkable higher motivation of sheep farmers for improved breeding in the three cities is likely to reflect the market and non-market preferences for non-local breeds of sheep which are influenced by both culture and religion (Brisebarre and Kuczynski 2009). For “Eid al-Kabir”, rams with special traits are preferred and long-legged sheep types such as the Yankasa sheep in Kano and the Sahelian sheep in Bobo Dioulasso and Sikasso fit these preferences well. White rams (Ayantunde et al. 2007), especially of the Sahelian Bali–Bali breed, and/or their crossbreds with Djallonke (Brisebarre and Kuczynski 2009) are preferred for “Eid al-Kabir” due to their size and heavier body weight and fetch higher market prices. Overall, these findings provide evidence that preferential selection of breeding animals is a common practice among both urban sheep and goat farmers, and suggest that there is less selection pressure on goats than on sheep, mainly because of the higher cultural and economic values of the latter. This leads to the hypothesis that irrespective of the city urban sheep farmers would be more interested than <b>goat</b> <b>keepers</b> to adopt improved breeding practices and to participate in the development and implementation of carefully designed genetic and management improvement programs.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a framework for community-based management (CBM) actions aiming to better utilize and to conserve the local small ruminants genetic resources in southern Benin. Hence, the study was designed in such a way as to: i) understand the livelihood contribution of each species of small ruminant to smallholders and identify a priority species (sheep or goats) for CBM activities, ii) collect and collate existing information on phenotypes and conduct surveys to map the phenotype structure of local populations of the targeted species, iii) record and understand farmers’ traditional breeding strategies and practices and iv) analyse the opportunities and constraints for CBM. In the study area in southern Benin, the majority (78 %) of rural households were keeping small ruminants. This confirms the important role of goats and sheep in the livelihood strategies of rural families. The ownership of goats was higher (91 %) than sheep (35 %) because goats are not affected by any ethnic or cultural restrictions. Goats are also perceived to be a less risky to invest into compared to sheep. Women represented 71 % of the <b>keepers</b> of <b>goats.</b> Owners of small ruminants are less likely to be involved in off-farm activities and would often have no access to credit facilities. These findings highlight the financing and insurance roles that small ruminants particularly goats, are playing in the study area. These results of the phenotypic characterization provided supporting evidence for spatial variation in population of goats in Benin. Four populations of goat were characterized as distinct and may be referred to as ecotypes. The significant morphological variability recorded infers a considerable genetic variability that needs to be maintained for further genetic improvement and to respond to changes in climate, disease and market conditions. Two rural communities were selected for in-depth studies. The results showed that goats are mainly kept for sale whenever cash is needed. Traits related to reproduction, to behavior, to health and to meat production were considered equally important and were ranked very high by <b>goat</b> <b>keepers.</b> Increased net income per flock through increased number of marketable animals was the derived breeding objective from the trait analysis. Poor management practices (poor disease control, poor housing and nutrition, uncontrolled mating) were identified as keys obstacles to improved smallholder’s goat production. Farmers were found more focused on immediate short-term benefits. Therefore, it was concluded that the overriding priority towards improvement was to develop initiatives to address the management constraints, and that the most effective way to achieve this is to bring farmers together in a participatory action planning process. Additional information on the communities and on their sources of livelihoods were collected through participatory village resource mapping and wealth ranking exercises, transect walks and focus group discussions and used to plan with the communities for community-led strategies towards better management and conservation of the local goat genetic resources. In general, the results of the CBM process outlined in this thesis have shown that because of the important role that play goats in their welfare and because they were offered the relevant information and technical support, people in the targeted communities organized themselves effectively and took appropriate actions to better manage and conserve the local goat resources. Given some time for consolidation and continual institutional and technical support, these newly created CBM groups are most likely to become self-reliant, socially and economically viable. The interactive nature of the CBM approach developed in this study allows its rapid adjustment to different local conditions and thus its replication elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|Goats {{are vital}} sources of meat, milk, manure, income and social {{security}} for poor smallholder farmers living in harsh and dry environments. Over the last decade, goat population in Ethiopia increased more rapidly than sheep and cattle population. Despite the current boom of goat population, contribution of goats for national meat and meat production {{as well as for}} export earnings is minimal. Moreover, the carcass yield of local goats remained below the East African and the world average over the last decade. Slow growth rates of goats, high mortality rate and low commercial off-take rate were the major challenges of smallholder goat production in Ethiopia. In order to overcome some of the these constraints, designing a sustainable community-based breeding program (CBBP) which considers local breeds, farmers trait preferences and local breeding organizations is a promising entry point. Understanding the multifaceted functions of goats across diverse production systems and identifying breeding objective traits and their relative economic importance are crucial for designing and implementing CBBPs. So far, choice experiments (CE) were employed as one option to identify breeding objective traits and elicit their economic values, but limited information is currently available in providing a comprehensive understanding of trait preferences from producers and market perspectives. Furthermore, sustainable genetic improvement programs not only focus on the technical feasibilities, but also analyze the organizational aspects of the breeding scheme under specified framework conditions. The overall objective of the study is to contribute for designing optimized goat community-based breeding programs that consider the multiple functions of goats, producers trait preferences, market demands and organizational frameworks by taking into consideration of the diverse goat production systems. The specific objectives are (i) to analyze factors affecting contributions of goat farming to household economic success and household dietary diversity in three goat production systems, (ii) to investigate goat breeding objectives and economic values of traits based on revealed and stated preferences and (iii) to identify major stakeholders, organizational networks and other elements of organization and their influence on the establishment and successful operation of community-based goat breeding. The study was conducted in Abergele, Konso and Meta Robi districts of Ethiopia representing arid agro-pastoral (AAP), semi-arid agro-pastoral (SAAP) and highland mixed crop-livestock (HMCL) systems, respectively. Household interviews using semi-structured questionnaires were conducted involving 180 households. The survey focused on income and costs of the major household agricultural enterprises as well as dietary diversity of households. Gross margin (GM) and net benefit (considering tangible and intangible benefits) were used as indicators of economic success of goat keeping. Linear mixed model (SAS version 9. 3) was employed to analyze factors affecting economic success of goat keeping and ordinal regression was used to predict effects of socio-economic variables on households dietary diversity. A choice experiment (CE) involving 360 farmers was conducted to identify farmers trait preferences across diverse goat production systems. Besides, in order to understand buyers revealed preferences (RP) for goat traits, market data of 796 goat transactions were collected. Relationships between goats attributes and prices were estimated by hedonic modeling, while economic values of traits included in the CE were estimated by conditional logit (CL) model. Part worth value of a trait which indicates the relative importance of a trait was calculated based on the implicit prices farmers were willing to pay (WTP) for an improvement of a trait. NLOGIT 4. 0 econometric software was used for analyzing the CE and RP data. The organization of smallholder goat breeding from village to national level were investigated through six focus group discussions with 68 <b>goat</b> <b>keepers,</b> key informant interviews with personnel of ten public and seven private institutions and social network analysis (SNA) of goat production and marketing structures. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze data generated from key informant interviews. Social Network Visualizer (SocNetV) was employed to visualize the social network structures. <b>Goat</b> <b>keepers</b> living in the harsh environment, which was represented by the AAP system, had significantly lower goat commercial off-take than those in SAAP and HMCL systems. Interaction between flock size and production system significantly (P< 0. 001) affected the net benefits from goat keeping. The increment of net benefit by keeping larger flocks was higher in AAP system, due to higher in-kind and intangible benefits of goats in this system. In contrast, farmers in the HMCL system had highest goat commercial off-take rate and they tend to sell growing goats (< 1 year) more frequently than matured ones. Effect of goat flock size as a predictor of household dietary diversity was not significant in any of the investigated production systems. Nevertheless, a significant positive correlation was observed between income from goats and dietary diversity in AAP system, indicating the indirect role of goat production for food security. Results of the revealed and stated preference studies showed that farmers derive high utility from large body size breeding goats in all production systems and buyers consistently paid high price for goats with higher body weight. In the AAP system, high economic values were assigned to adaptive traits such as disease resistance for both bucks and does. Goat breeders in this system were willing to pay nearly three times more than those in the SAAP and HMCL systems for breeding bucks with high disease resistance ability, while this trait was not considered as a determining factor for selecting breeding does in the HMCL system. Goat producers in the HMCL system were willing to pay more than farmers in the AAP and SAAP systems for a doe with twinning ability. Results of the breeding organizational analysis showed that own and village flocks were the major sources of breeding goats in all districts. In AAP system, however, NGOs and research centers also supplied breeding goats to farmers. The identified famers organizations linked to goat production and marketing includes multipurpose cooperatives, farmer development groups and farmer networks. The multipurpose cooperatives in the AAP system were engaged in more marketing activities than those in the SAAP and HMCL systems. Key stakeholders such as research institutes and NGOs were absent in HMCL system. The SNA indicated that district extension officers had the highest values of degree and closeness centrality indicating their trustful relationship with <b>goat</b> <b>keepers</b> and best accessibility. The higher in-kind and intangible benefits of goats in AAP system coupled with high economic values attached to adaptive traits indicates the need of inclusion of survival traits in addition to the performance traits in formulating breeding goals in the harsh arid environments. In the mixed crop-livestock system, where generation of cash income through increased commercial goat off-take is the prominent farmers priority and twinning abilities of goats were highly valued, improving reproductive performances {{to increase the number of}} marketable goats should be targeted. However, poor institutional presence and insignificant economic role of goats in HMCL and SAAP systems makes establishing goat CBBPs less feasible, while the active institutional support and better marketing opportunities in the AAP system makes goat CBBPs more promising. District extension officers should play major facilitation and liaison roles in the establishment and operation of the CBBPs due to their prominent position in the social network. Ziegen sind für arme Kleinbauern in rauen und trockenen Regionen wesentliche Quellen für Fleisch, Milch, Dünger, Einkommen und soziale Sicherheit. Die Zahl der Ziegen in Äthiopien stieg im letzten Jahrzehnt deutlich schneller an als die Zahl der Schafe und Rinder. Trotz des derzeitig starken Anstiegs, ist der Beitrag der Ziegen zur nationalen Fleischproduktion sowie zu den Exporteinnahmen gering. Zusätzlich blieb die Schlachtausbeute der lokalen Ziegen im letzten Jahrzehnt unter dem ostafrikanischen und dem Weltdurchschnitt. Langsame Wachstumsraten der Ziegen, hohe Sterblichkeitsraten und geringe Verkaufsraten zählen zu den größten Herausforderungen für die kleinbäuerliche Ziegenhaltung in Äthiopien. Ein vielversprechender Ansatz, um einige dieser Einschränkungen zu überwinden, ist die Gestaltung eines nachhaltigen, dörflichen Zuchtprogramms (CBBP), das sowohl lokale Rassen als auch Merkmalspräferenzen der Landwirte und regionale Zuchtorganisationen berücksichtigt. Unverzichtbar für die Gestaltung und Umsetzung der CBBPs ist einerseits das Verständnis der vielfältigen Funktionen der Ziegen über die verschiedene Produktionssysteme hinweg und die Identifizierung der Zuchtzielmerkmale und deren relative ökonomische Bedeutung andererseits. Zur Bestimmung der Zuchtzielmerkmale und der Feststellung des jeweiligen ökonomischen Wertes wurden bislang Choice Experiments (CE) eingesetzt. Derzeit sind jedoch nur begrenzt Informationen, die ein umfassendes Verständnis der Merkmalspräferenzen aus Sicht der Produzenten und des Marktes bieten, verfügbar. Nachhaltige Programme für eine genetische Verbesserung fokussieren zusätzlich nicht nur auf die technische Umsetzbarkeit, sondern analysieren auch die organisatorischen Aspekte des Züchtungsschemas unter bestimmten Rahmenbedingungen. Das übergeordnete Ziel dieser Studie ist es, zur Gestaltung eines optimierten dörflichen Ziegenzuchtprogramms, welches die vielfältigen Funktionen der Ziegen, die Merkmalspräferenzen der Produzenten, die|$|R
30|$|Our results {{reveal the}} multi-functionality of goats and sheep among urban dwellers {{in the three}} {{locations}} investigated, whereby their financial functions were ranked as of paramount importance. This {{finding is consistent with}} what was stated in earlier studies by Touré and Ouattara (2001), Ajala et al. (2008) and Baah et al. (2012) in selected urban communities in Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria and Ghana, respectively, but contrasts with reports by Thys and Ekembe (1992) and Lawal-Adebowale (2012) who described that urban small ruminants are mainly raised for home consumption. The remarkable variations of the production objectives across locations and between species observed in the current study are likely to be related to differences in social and economic contexts. For example, the objective “Sale of live animals for extra cash during Eid al-Kabir” for sheep production was of significantly higher importance in Kano and Sikasso compared to Bobo Dioulasso, probably because of the higher proportion of Muslims and thus higher demand for sheep in these cities during this Islamic holiday. Milk production was no production objective for urban small ruminants; this has been confirmed by the very insignificant number of <b>goat</b> and sheep <b>keepers</b> who were milking their animals and can be explained by cultural preferences for goat and sheep meat and bias against the consumption of their milk in the study locations. Consumption of goat milk is even regarded as taboo in many West African societies (Belewu and Aiyegbusi 2002; Dubeuf 2010). The lack of awareness of its nutritional advantages is probably a further explanation of the unpopularity of small ruminant milk in the study area.|$|R
40|$|Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) - 1 Cue: Peste des petits ruminants, {{commonly}} known as PPR, or sometimes Goat Plague, {{is one of the}} most serious diseases affecting goats and sheep in Africa. It is particularly common in West Africa, but extends across the Sahel to Sudan and Ethiopia, causing huge economic losses when outbreaks occur. Animals that are infected with the disease can die within a few days, and because the disease is caused by a virus, treatment options are limited. However, sheep and <b>goat</b> <b>keepers</b> are not powerless in the face of PPR. There are ways of controlling outbreaks, and of protecting animals so that they become immune to the virus. In our next report, Dr Tih Joseph Shefe, a veterinary doctor based in Cameroon explains to Martha Chindong about the symptoms of the disease, and what farmers can do to protect their livestock. IN:		If you have an animal ? OUT:		?protected against the disease. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 36 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Dr Tih Joseph Shefe with some good advice for livestock keepers to always keep a close watch on the health of their animals so they can respond quickly when disease occurs. Transcript Shefe	If you have an animal that is sick of Peste des Petits Ruminants, the first thing you are going to notice is that your animal has gone off its feed; it is not eating as before. You will find a lot of drizzling of saliva. Mucus will be flowing out of the nose and the eyes, so the animal is actually suffering from respiratory distress. Again, you will find that there is diarrhoea, and in fact if you look at the mouth closely, open the mouth and you will see that there are erosions around the teeth. This makes the animal not able to eat; it goes off its feed, and it has difficulty breathing, and of course with the profuse diarrhoea it dies. Chindong	Now, can a farmer do something when he or she identifies these signs? Shefe	Yes, something can be done. But now, it is unfortunate that there is no straightforward treatment to this disease. Like I say it is a viral disease and you have no drugs now available for treating it. So the best would be to isolate your sick animal and treat it symptomatically. That is give it just general antibiotics, treat it against diarrhoea, but most of the time the animal will die. All in all you can vaccinate the animals before they fall sick, so there is a control measure. Chindong	So the farmers can only take precautions. Now, talking about vaccination; you know farmers have one or two goats here and there. Now how can this small quantity be vaccinated, considering the cost of a vaccine? Shefe	Ok, that is a good question. Now what normally should be done, which we have done before is, you get a number of farmers in a given village together, fix a rendezvous, and then go and vaccinate as many animals as they can find on the spot in the village. Because with the rendezvous they are going to respect your coming in. Chindong	What of the farmers? health? Shefe	The disease as such does not affect the farmers, human beings in general, because it is not a zoonotic disease. Chindong	But can the farmers help to transmit the disease from one animal to another? Shefe	Exactly, it can happen. Especially if he has an animal, he has a goat or a sheep that is sick of this very disease, but he doesn?t know, and then he goes to handle the animal because it is in pain. Now he leaves it there, and he has to go and tether another one in the bush, or just by the roadside for it to graze. At the time he is touching the next animal, he is actually helping to transmit the disease from the sick animal to the one that is not sick yet. So farmers themselves can be actually the transmitting agents between animals, without knowing of course. Chindong	Now what advice can you give farmers? Shefe	I really would appreciate it very much if farmers become aware that they have no treatment for this disease but they can vaccinate. This vaccine is not expensive, and they only need to come together in a group and arrange with the extension agent or with the technical officer; he will certainly come around and vaccinate their animals and for very little [money]. So they have no reason to despair, because the disease can be combated through vaccination. Chindong	Ok. Is there anything that you would love us to share with farmers concerning this peste des petits ruminants? Shefe	I would very much appreciate it that farmers should take their time and look at their animals very well. Try to observe their animals daily. Know them individually if possible, and be able to identify at the first sign, each time an animal is not in good shape. Then they will easily identify when the disease is around, so they isolate the sick animals. They will therefore be kind enough to call on the vaccination officers at least once a year, so that their animals get protected against the disease. End of track.

40|$|Controlled {{and healthy}} {{breeding}} Cue: Often, the mating of goats happens without any planning or control by the farmer. However, {{there are many}} advantages to farmers if they control which animals mate and when. This allows the farmer to plan when the birth of kids will occur, helping them to match {{the growth of the}} kids with feed availability and market requirements. If all the nannies produce kids within a short period, this can also make tasks such as weaning, castration, vaccination and feeding more easy to manage. Marketing may also be simpler if all the kids are ready for sale at the same time. There are various ways that farmers can prevent unplanned mating in their goats. The simplest method may be to keep bucks and nannies separately, although this will be more difficult if animals are allowed to graze freely. Other methods include tying a special apron around the belly of the buck, which prevents it from mating. In Tanzania, the NGO Farm-Africa has been supporting farmers in improving their rearing of goats. Lazarus Laiser visited the office in Arusha and met Communication Officer Glory Mziray. He asked her to explain more about why controlling the mating of animals is important, and other ways to achieve healthy breeding of goats. IN:		?Farmers control mating of their goats ?? OUT:		??you?ll find more benefits from them. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 18 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Glory Mziray of the NGO FARM-Africa with some encouragement for <b>goat</b> <b>keepers.</b> The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Mziray	Farmers control mating of their goats in order to avoid in-breeding, such as mating of animals of the same family, like brothers to sisters, brothers to mothers, daughters to fathers. In-breeding results in reduced performance in production and reproduction, like weak offspring, reduced production, reduced growth rates, etc. Laiser	How to avoid in-breeding? Mziray	One can avoid in-breeding by avoiding mating related animals, keep good records to guide your mating, to differentiate related from unrelated ones. Laiser	Therefore the farmer needs to keep the records for the buck? Mziray	Of course that is very important for the farmer. Laiser	Are there any factors considering timing of the new births? Mziray	Of course there are, one of them being season of the year. Appropriate season in relation to feeds, water, and incidences of diseases and parasites. And the other one is the ability of farmers to manage the animals. Laiser	To the human being it is possible to control the date of birth. How about goats? Is there any possibility to decide the date of birth? Mziray	This is possible to determine the date of the birth through deciding when to mate, so that the nanny gives birth at the time determined, and through administering proper feeding so that the nanny comes into heat regularly. Laiser	What are things to be considered when mating goats for the first time? Mziray	Things to be considered when mating goats for the first time. First of {{all you need to know}} age at first mating, recommended over one year, and you need to consider the body weight. This should be 75 % to 80 % of mature bodies. And the health status is important. The animal should be healthy and physically fit. And freedom from abnormalities, this is an important factor. Laiser	How about the feeds, is it needed any special diet for the nannies and bucks before and after breeding? Mziray	There are special diets for both nannies and bucks before and after breeding. As for the nanny, before breeding the nanny needs a special diet to encourage ovulation and conception. This feeding is termed flushing. Flushing gives high chances for twinning. After breeding the last two months of pregnancy needs also special diet to promote foetus growth, as at this stage the growth is faster. In case of twins the feeds will cater for the high demands of food, and the nanny will be strong at kidding. And the buck, a special diet is needed to promote semen synthesis and make it strong during mating. So the special diet is before mating, but after breeding no special diet is required. Laiser	What should be considered when taking care of kids? Mziray	Just like human being, a newly born kid should suckle colostrum within the first 24 hours after birth. Please farmers allow the kid to feed colostrum as much as they can. After a week kids should be provided with small quantities of good clean feeds, and then the kids should continue in milk for three weeks, and thereafter be allowed milk with fresh mixed fodder up to the three to four months. Laiser	If we take weaning, what is the correct time of weaning? Mziray	The age at weaning depends very much upon the level of management the kid receives. But on average the young stock will be weaned at four months of age. Laiser	Diseases are dangerous to everyone even to goats I think. How to prevent the kids from diseases? Mziray	There are some suggested ways to control diseases and parasites, one of them being maintaining good hygiene. As you can see this is not applicable to goats alone, even to human beings. So a farmer should maintain good hygiene, should make proper feeding to the goat, and proper routine managerial practices, proper ventilation in kids houses and pens, proper drainage system as well. Laiser	Thank you very much sister Glory for all information that you gave us. Do you have anything that you would like to tell the farmer who is listening to our programme? Mziray	Dear farmers, I would like you to take very good care of your goats, and you?ll find more benefits from them. End of track. Avoiding in-breeding, timing new births, choosing goats for mating, feeds for breeding animals, and care of kids...|$|R
