5|$|Reich and Ilse Ollendorff {{divorced}} in September 1951, ostensibly {{because he thought}} she had had an affair. She continued working with him for another three years. Even after the divorce, he suspected her of having affairs, and persuaded her to sign confessions about her feelings of fear and hatred toward him, which <b>he</b> <b>locked</b> away in the archives of his Orgone Institute. He wrote several documents denouncing her, while having an affair himself with Lois Wyvell, who ran the Orgone Institute Press.|$|E
5|$|The early 1990s {{also served}} up {{a series of}} {{difficult}} experiences and public embarrassment for Jennings. On August 13, 1993, Jennings and Kati Marton publicly announced their separation in Newsday. The couple had previously split in 1987 for four months after Jennings found out that Marton {{was having an affair with}} Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen. In January 1994, <b>he</b> <b>locked</b> horns with his executive producer on World News Tonight, Emily Rooney. The public firing of Rooney made national headlines, and put Jennings on the defensive.|$|E
5|$|Young Como started {{helping his}} family at age 10, working {{before and after}} school in Steve Fragapane's barber shop for 50¢ a week. By age 13, he had {{graduated}} to having his own chair in the Fragapane barber shop, although he stood on a box to tend to his customers. It was also around this time that young Como lost his week's wages in a dice game. Filled with shame, <b>he</b> <b>locked</b> himself in his room and did not come out until hunger {{got the better of}} him. He managed to tell his father {{what had happened to the}} money his family depended on. His father told him he was entitled to make a mistake and that he hoped his son would never do anything worse than this. When Perry was 14, his father became unable to work because of a severe heart condition. Como and his brothers became the support of the household.|$|E

5|$|Castroneves led {{the field}} {{back up to}} speed at the lap-51 restart; he was {{followed}} by Fernández, Bräck and Dixon. Carpentier broke his rear wing after he collided with the turn one tire barrier when <b>he</b> <b>locked</b> his brakes and retired after {{it was discovered that}} his gearbox had sustained damage. Having restarted in seventh place, Andretti moved up into fourth position by lap 54. By the 60th lap, Castroneves had a 4.8 second lead over Fernández, who in turn was 3.5 seconds ahead of Bräck. Andretti was a further three seconds behind the Swedish driver, and was holding a two-second lead over Kanaan. Bräck went off at turn nine to retire with a mechanical issue that drained his car's battery on lap 63. Castroneves made a scheduled pit stop on lap 65, handing the lead to Fernández, and rejoined in tenth place. His car started to billow smoke after leaving turn one two laps later and pulled {{off to the side of}} the track at turn eight to retire. The seventh caution period was on the 68th lap to allow safety officials to remove Castroneves' car from the track. Most of the leaders (including Fernández) made pit stops to ensure they could reach the end of the race. Kanaan gained the lead and relinquished it to Andretti when he made a pit stop; Andretti led the field back up to speed at the lap-72 restart, followed by Tagliani.|$|E
5|$|On lap 13, Felipe Massa passed Marcus Ericsson for ninth {{place and}} one lap later, Hamilton capitalised on a mistake by Vettel and overtook him to retake second {{position}}. Vettel lost another position when he let Räikkönen pass him on lap 16, the two being on different strategies. Meanwhile, Rosberg {{had built up}} a lead of around six seconds to Hamilton. On lap 19, Carlos Sainz Jr. allowed teammate Max Verstappen to pass him, while Alonso came in for what was his third pit stop of the race, leaving him in last position. Two laps later, Verstappen created flatspots on his tyres when <b>he</b> <b>locked</b> up his brakes, forcing him to pit. He emerged in 15th position. Vettel came in for his first pit stop on lap 24, coming out in sixth place ahead of compatriot Nico Hülkenberg. At the same time, Hamilton started to reduce the gap to Rosberg in front, cutting it down to less than two seconds by lap 29. With his teammate closing in, Rosberg made pit stops on lap 32, with Räikkönen following suit, whose pit stop was delayed, losing him around four seconds. Sergio Pérez was starting {{to close the gap}} to both Ferrari drivers in front of him after pitting early. Vettel reacted on lap 41 and changed to the super-soft tyres, coming out behind both Pérez and Ricciardo in sixth. One lap later, Hamilton came in for his second and final stop, having asked his team before if {{it would be possible to}} finish the race without stopping again. He emerged twelve seconds behind Rosberg and started to cut into his advantage immediately.|$|E
5|$|Vergne was {{the fastest}} driver not to advance {{into the final}} session; his best lap time of one minute and 34.984 seconds was two seconds off Rosberg's pace in the second session. He {{received}} a ten-place grid penalty, his sixth of the season, because his team had changed his engine. As a result, Perez inherited eleventh position. He encountered slower cars entering the final chicane, which forced him to reduce his speed and lose brake and tyre temperature. Kvyat's final timed lap was disrupted by slower cars; {{when he entered the}} first corner his tyres had not reached their optimum temperature, compromising his run and giving him twelfth position. Nico Hülkenberg qualified 13th after <b>he</b> <b>locked</b> his tyres at the final chicane. Adrian Sutil progressed to the second qualifying session after making balance set-up changes, and took 14th in its closing seconds. His Sauber teammate, Gutiérrez, struggled with tyre temperature and was caught in traffic on his out-lap; he took 15th. Pastor Maldonado failed to advance beyond the first qualifying session, but Lotus installed a new engine (his sixth of the year) in his E22 chassis on Friday morning. Like Vergne, he incurred a ten-place grid penalty (carried over to the next race because he qualified within the top-ten bottom positions). His teammate, Romain Grosjean, took over 16th position and aimed to qualify higher; however, a change in wind direction prevented him from recording a faster lap time. Ericsson and Jules Bianchi started from 17th and 18th, with Kobayashi beginning the race in 19th position. Chilton lost control of his Marussia's rear end, which caused him to start 21st.|$|E

He grabbed his rifle, {{but by the time he}} could retrieve some ammunition and load his gun, Bryant had left in the BMW. A police officer arrived several minutes later and then set out in pursuit of Bryant.|$|E
25|$|Swayze, {{who was an}} FAA {{licensed}} pilot with {{an instrument}} rating, made the news on June 1, 2000, while flying with his dogs in his twin-engine Cessna 414 N414PS, from Van Nuys, California to Las Vegas, New Mexico. His plane developed a pressurization problem, causing Swayze to make a precautionary landing on a dirt road in a housing complex in Prescott Valley, Arizona. The plane's right wing struck a light pole, but Swayze was unharmed. <b>He</b> <b>locked</b> the cockpit, left the aircraft in the subdivision, and obtained a ride—with his dogs—from a passing vehicle driven by Gary Bruso, in order to telephone the authorities. According to the police report, witnesses said that Swayze appeared to be extremely intoxicated and asked for help to remove evidence—an open {{bottle of wine and}} a 30-pack of beer—from the crash site. He made himself unavailable to police for several hours. It was later determined that the alcohol in question was not in the cabin, but stored in external storage compartments inaccessible in flight and that the probable cause of the accident was Swayze's physical impairment due to the cumulative effects of carbon monoxide from engine exhaust by-products, carbon monoxide from heavy tobacco use, and the loss of an undetermined amount of cabin pressurization, resulting in hypoxia.|$|E

When Kathy shuts up the café, she is startled when James comes in. As James acts casual, Kathy takes hold of a knife and James tells Kathy he has been diagnosed with terminal liver cancer. Kathy rubbishes James' beliefs that they are alike and James says {{the reason for his}} visit is to move on from the past. Kathy wants James to explain truthfully what happened {{on the night of the}} rape, but when he refuses to do so, Kathy retells it, demanding to know when he decided to rape her and she realises that James chose to rape her when <b>he</b> <b>locked</b> up The Dagmar. Kathy tells James that he has scared her that night like the night he raped her, but James, still in denial, refuses to apologise for the rape and he leaves Kathy his address. Kathy confides in Ian that James is back and Ian contacts Phil about James.|$|E
25|$|Fassler {{extended}} his lead to 1.5 seconds over Jarvis while both Toyota cars were lapping one second {{slower than the}} leader's place, and the No. 4 ByKolles car moved in front of Rebellion Racing's No. 13 vehicle. Bernard lost control of his car while lapping one of the Ford GT entrants, allowing Jarvis to close up to the Porsche driver. Bernard attempted to pass Fässler around the outside at turn one for first position but the latter defended his line and narrowly avoided going wide off the track. It allowed Jarvis and Jani to again close the gap {{and made it a}} four-car battle for first place while lapping slower traffic. Bruni battled Mücke for third in LMGTE Pro and had Harry Tincknell in the second Ford close behind him. Bernard caught Fässler, who was held up by one of the Aston Martin cars in the final turn, and temporarily claimed the lead in the first corner before running wide. Bernhard avoided hitting the KCMG car, allowing the No. 7 Audi to retake the position at the turn's exit. Jani attempted to move in front by going around the inside of Jarvis, but after driving back onto the racing line heading into the first turn, <b>he</b> <b>locked</b> his tyres. This caused Jani to drive straight, and Mücke's front-end made contact with the Porsche's left-rear corner, causing Jani to spin off into the run-off area.|$|E
25|$|Kvyat was {{the fastest}} driver not to advance {{into the final}} {{qualifying}} session; his fastest time of one minute and 26.070 seconds was {{one and a half}} seconds off Hamilton's pace in the second session. However, he received a ten-place grid penalty for changing his engine overnight, his sixth of the season. As a result, Räikkonen moved into eleventh. Räikkonen struggled with car grip and locked his front tyres, abandoning his first timed lap because cars leaving the pit lane hindered his visibility entering the Rettifilo chicane, and after preparing for his second attempt, <b>he</b> <b>locked</b> his right-front wheel and ran into the run-off area. Jean-Éric Vergne started from 12th with Hülkenberg unable to match his teammate's pace in 13th because he was delayed by slower traffic while preparing his for his lap at Parabolica and felt his car was loose. Sutil had problems driving but gradually improved his car's balance as he circulated the track and improved on his final lap to secure 14th, ahead of teammate Esteban Gutiérrez who made a slight error on his final lap. Maldonado failed to advance beyond the first qualifying session, with teammate Grosjean managing five laps after missing the opening 13 minutes while his team repaired a fluid leak discovered before qualifying. Kobayashi slipstreamed teammate Marcus Ericsson to move ahead of Jules Bianchi for 18th, with Bianchi not improving as he slid sideways through the Ascari chicane and other drivers set faster lap times on the medium compound tyres. His teammate Max Chilton qualified 20th and Ericsson completed the field in 22nd; the latter was hindered {{due to a lack of}} decent running on the medium compound tyres following an engine problem in the third practice session.|$|E

25|$|Bottas's {{preparation}} for his final timed lap was slightly compromised, {{and made a}} mistake in the first turn, restricting him to eighth. Magnussen took ninth and Kvyat rounded out the top ten after only having the super soft compound tyre available to him. Button was the fastest driver not to advance into the final session; his best lap time of one minute and 46.943 seconds was 1.1 seconds slower than Rosberg's pace in the second session. <b>He</b> <b>locked</b> his front tyres at the turn 13 hairpin on his final timed lap and went wide, losing him time, and struggled with front-end grip despite changing engine and differential settings. Vergne did not improve on his second attempt, struggling with front-end grip, and locked his tyres, restricting him to 12th. The two Force India cars qualified in 13th and 15th (with Hülkenberg ahead of Pérez) after being unable to improve on their fastest laps at their second attempts and were separated by Gutiérrez in the faster of the two Sauber entries. Romain Grosjean was the slowest driver in the second session; he suffered from a turbocharger wastegate problem that prevented him from driving at full power and vented his frustration to Lotus over the radio after being eliminated. Adrian Sutil failed to advance beyond the first qualifying session, after having energy management and engine problems that prevented him from pushing hard. Maldonado was affected by the same problem his teammate had and was only able to qualify 18th. Jules Bianchi made minor mistakes on his first timed lap en route to 19th and was ahead of Kamui Kobayashi in 20th. Max Chilton could not extract full engine power on his first attempt because of mapping problems and had to prepare for another lap and took 21st. Marcus Ericsson ventured onto the track late in the first session after his team worked quickly to rectify an electrical issue and completed the field in 22nd.|$|E
