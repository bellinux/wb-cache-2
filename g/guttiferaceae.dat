Fraction B was purified on silica gel CC using gradient conditions of Hex/EA and 17 {{was obtained from}} the Hex/EA (3 : 2, v/v). Similarly, bark powder (2.8  kg) of Pachystela msolo Engl. (Sapotaceae) was extracted with DCM/MeOH (1 : 1), yielding a dark crude extract (30  g). The purification of this later in gradient conditions of Hex/EA afforded 15 (5  mg). The stem bark (2.5  kg) of Garcinia ovalifolia (<b>Guttiferaceae)</b> was air-dried, ground and macerated in MeOH for 48  h. A brown residue (120  g) was obtained after concentrating the organic solution. Vacuum liquid chromatography was used for a first fractionation with gradient of hex/EA and EA/MeOH. Fractions obtained from Hex and Hex/EA (3 : 1, v/v) were pooled together (1.22  g) and purified by silica gel CC with gradients of the same mixture of solvents to afford 16 (12  mg). Fractions collected from EA/MeOH (9 : 1 and 4 : 1) were also pooled together and purified on silica gel CC with gradients of DCM/MeOH to yield compound 18 (90  mg). The stem bark (1.8  kg) of Alchornea Laxiflora (Euphorbiaceae) was macerated in MeOH. The concentrated methanol crude extract (30  g) was subjected to silica gel flash chromatography using Hex (A), EA (B) and MeOH (C). Fraction C (10  g) was purified by silica gel CC using the gradient of DCM/MeOH. Compound 19 (15  mg) was isolated from sub-fractions eluted with DCM/MeOH (95 : 5).|$|E
