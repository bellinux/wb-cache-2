40|$|International audienceA new {{methodology}} for failure rate evaluation with <b>influencing</b> <b>factors</b> is proposed. A quantitative part allows integrating potential available data from feedback. Then, a qualitative analysis deals with <b>influencing</b> <b>factors</b> such as design, environment, and use {{to provide more}} coherent and argued results. The main idea is to use some criteria to fix the failure rate within a prior interval, according to the <b>influencing</b> <b>factor</b> states. To this end, the system is broken up into main component groups. When a component group is susceptible to an <b>influencing</b> <b>factor,</b> its baseline failure rate is multiplied by the relevant influencing coefficient. A seven-step methodology is presented to define the model, identify and rate the <b>influencing</b> <b>factors,</b> set indicator functions taking the uncertainties into account, and calculate the influencing coefficients. The proposed methodology is global enough to be usable for {{a large number of}} safety instrumented systems and <b>influencing</b> <b>factors.</b> For example, an application regarding safety pressure relief valves is given.

40|$|Purpose / Context - Residential energy {{consumption}} except heating (RECEH) {{plays an important}} role in China. The purposes of this study were to analyze RECEH in Beijing and find out the influence factors of RECEH. Methodology / Approach - A survey of 2024 households in Beijing was undertaken. The investigat-ed residences were located in 23 residential communities and two farmers markets. Questionnaire contents included six aspects: building information, building envelope, living style, auxiliary household appliance, electricity consumption and other {{energy consumption}}. While electricity consumption in 8571 families, gas consumption in 189 families, and water consumption in 414 families have been measured by the meter readings last for four months and a year. This paper obtained the results by a method combining data statistics with grey correlation analysis. Results –The results showed that the annual average consumption of electricity and air conditioner electricity in each household was 1689 and 160. 4 kWh separately. In addition, the quantity of annual average gas usage was 140 m³/household and the water consumption was 80 m³/household. The analysis of <b>influence</b> <b>factor</b> showed that usable floor area and number of household members was the most profound impact on the entire electricity and gas consumption respectively. The most im-portant <b>influence</b> <b>factor</b> of high, middle, low level electricity consumption families was the number of glass layers, number of household members and temperature setting of air conditioner separately.

For the class of applications, mobile distributed realtime database systems must simultaneously satisfy two requirements in guaranteeing data security and minimizing the missing deadlines ratio of transactions. Multilevel secure database systems based on mandatory access control can prevent direct unlawful information flows between transactions. However, they can’t be free from illegal information transfers between transactions belonging to different clearance levels by means of the concurrency control mechanism. This paper presents a secure hybrid optimistic real-time concurrency control protocol (SHORTCCP) for mobile distributed real-time database systems. The SHORTCCP not only fully considers the intrinsic limitations of mobile environments and the requirements of timing constraints of real-time transactions, but also makes an effective tradeoff between security and real-time performance by introducing secure <b>influence</b> <b>factor</b> and real-time <b>influence</b> <b>factor.</b> The experimental results show the SHORTCCP achieves data security without degrading real-time performance significantly.
