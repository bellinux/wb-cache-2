You weren't as surrounded by your peers as everybody else your age was... <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>case</b> it meant tremendous amount of reading at an early age... I read, listened to radio... I became utterly besotted with daytime serials... it enabled me {{to live in an}} imaginary world where one is comfortable with abstract ideas, dominated by stories, narrative, and characters.|$|E
25|$|White {{decided not}} to accept any more prizes for his work, and he {{declined}} both the $10,000 Britannia Award and another Miles Franklin Award. White was approached by Harry M. Miller {{to work on a}} screenplay for Voss but nothing came of it. He became an active opponent of literary censorship and joined a number of other public figures in signing a statement of defiance against Australia’s decision to participate in the Vietnam War. His name had sometimes been mentioned as a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature, but in 1971, after losing to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, he wrote to a friend: That Nobel Prize! I hope I never hear it mentioned again. I certainly don't want it; the machinery behind it seems a bit dirty, when we thought that only applied to Australian awards. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>case</b> to win the prize would upset my life far too much, and it would embarrass me to be held up to the world as an Australian writer when, apart from the accident of blood, I feel I am temperamentally a cosmopolitan Londoner.|$|E

500|$|I don't {{want people}} being crushed. I want the joy that I {{used to get}} seeing Godzilla toss a tank without having to think there are guys in the tank… What I think is you could do nothing but echo the moment you're in. There is a global anxiety about how fragile {{the status quo is}} and the safety of citizens, but in my mind—honestly—this film is in another realm. There is no {{correlation}} to the real world. There is no fear of a copycat Kaiju attack because a Kaiju saw it on the news and said, [...] "I'm going to destroy Seattle." [...] <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>case,</b> I'm picking up a tradition. One that started right after World War II and was a coping mechanism, in a way, for Japan to heal the wounds of that war. And it's integral for a Kaiju to rampage in the city.|$|E
500|$|It is {{also stated}} that my name, my real name, {{that is the one}} I am known by, is not my real name. Now one is given one's name—one's {{authentic}} ones—at some such ceremony as baptism, Christening, or the like, on the occasion of one's formal reception into a certain religious Faith. In the ancient Zarathustrian Parsi community to which, on my father's side, I have the honour to belong, this ceremony is normally performed, as in other Faiths, in childhood, or owing to special circumstances as <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>case,</b> later in life, when I assumed my name as it now is or, {{in the words of the}} legal document in which this is mentioned [...] "...received into the Parsi community and in accordance with the custom and tradition thereof, is now and will be henceforth known as..."

500|$|Otto Frank {{spent the}} {{remainder}} of his life as custodian of his daughter's legacy, saying, [...] "It's a strange role. In the normal family relationship, it is the child of the famous parent who has the honour and the burden of continuing the task. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>case</b> the role is reversed." [...] He recalled his publisher's explaining why he thought the diary has been so widely read, with the comment, [...] "he said that the diary encompasses so many areas of life that each reader can find something that moves him personally". Simon Wiesenthal expressed a similar sentiment when he said that the diary had raised more widespread awareness of the Holocaust than had been achieved during the Nuremberg Trials, because [...] "people identified with this child. This was the impact of the Holocaust, this was a family like my family, like your family and so you could understand this." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{her final}} years, Dworkin {{suffered}} fragile health, and she revealed {{in her last}} column for the Guardian {{that she had been}} weakened and nearly crippled {{for the past several years}} by severe osteoarthritis in the knees. Shortly after returning from Paris in 1999, she had been hospitalized with a high fever and blood clots in her legs. A few months after being released from the hospital, she became increasingly unable to bend her knees, and underwent surgery to replace her knees with titanium and plastic prosthetics. She wrote, [...] "The doctor who knows me best says that osteoarthritis begins long before it cripples [...] <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>case,</b> possibly from homelessness, or sexual abuse, or beatings on my legs, or my weight. John, my partner, blames Scapegoat, a study of Jewish identity and women's liberation that took me nine years to write; it is, he says, the book that stole my health. I blame the drug-rape that I experienced in 1999 in Paris." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite being married, Beatrice {{fulfilled}} {{her promise}} to the Queen by continuing as her full-time confidante and secretary. Queen Victoria warmed to Henry, as she often did with other handsome, strong men. However, the Queen criticised Beatrice's conduct {{during her first}} pregnancy. When Beatrice stopped coming to the Queen's dinners a week before giving birth, preferring to eat alone in her room, the Queen wrote angrily to her physician, Dr James Reid, that, [...] "I [...] coming to dinner, and not simply moping in her own room, which is very bad for her. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>case</b> I regularly came to dinner, except when I was really unwell (even when suffering a great deal) up to the very last day." [...] Beatrice, aided by chloroform, gave birth the following week to her first son, Alexander. Despite suffering a miscarriage {{in the early months}} of her marriage, Beatrice gave birth to four children: Alexander, called [...] "Drino", was born in 1886; Ena in 1887; Leopold in 1889 and Maurice in 1891. Following this, she took a polite and encouraging interest in social issues, such as conditions in the coal mines. However, this interest did not extend to changing the conditions of poverty, as it had done with her brother, the Prince of Wales.|$|E

500|$|Those with fitting names give differing {{accounts}} {{of the effect of}} their name on their career choices. Igor Judge, former Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, said he has no recollection of anyone commenting on his destined profession when he was a child, adding [...] "I'm absolutely convinced <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>case</b> it is entirely coincidental and I can't think of any evidence in my life that suggests otherwise." [...] James Counsell on the other hand, having chosen a career in law just like his father, his sibling, and two distant relatives, reported having been spurred on to join the bar from an early age and he cannot remember ever wanting to do anything else. Sue Yoo, an American lawyer, said that when she was younger people urged her to become a lawyer because of her name, which she thinks may have helped her decision. Weather reporter Storm Field was not sure about the influence of his name; his father, also a weather reporter, was his driving force. Psychology professor Lewis Lipsitt, a lifelong collector of aptronyms, was lecturing about nominative determinism in class when a student pointed out that Lipsitt himself was subject to the effect since he studied babies' sucking behaviour. Lipsitt said [...] "That had never occurred to me." [...] Church of England vicar Reverend Michael Vickers, who denied being a Vickers {{had anything to do with}} him becoming a vicar, suggesting instead that in some cases [...] "perhaps people are actually escaping from their name, rather than moving towards their job".|$|E
2500|$|Douglas has {{credited}} his mother, Bryna, for instilling in him {{the importance}} of [...] "gambling on yourself", and he kept her advice in mind when making films. Bryna Productions was named in her honor. Douglas realized that his intense style of acting {{was something of a}} shield: [...] "Acting is the most direct way of escaping reality, and <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>case</b> it was a means of escaping a drab and dismal background." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Any change {{makes me}} apprehensive, {{even if it}} offers the {{greatest}} promise of improving my condition, and I am persuaded by this natural instinct of mine that I must take heed if I wish that the threads which the Fates spin so thin and weak <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>case</b> to be spun to any length. My great thanks, to my well-wishers and friends, who think so kindly of me as to undertake my welfare, {{but at the same}} time a most humble request to protect me in my current condition from any disturbance." ...|$|E

I am heartened by the emerging debate in the U.S. about what has been happening to our countries and ideals {{in the past six}} years. And I am hopeful that eventually I will be allowed to enter the country so that I may contribute to the debate and be enriched by dialogue." ...|$|E
2500|$|He was not {{a strict}} vegetarian, though he said he {{preferred}} that diet and advocated it {{as a means of}} self-improvement. He wrote in Walden, [...] "The practical objection to animal food <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>case</b> was its uncleanness; and besides, when I had caught and cleaned and cooked and eaten my fish, they seemed not to have fed me essentially. It was insignificant and unnecessary, and cost more than it came to. A little bread or a few potatoes would have done as well, with less trouble and filth." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of {{sentencing}} Siddiqui did not show any interest in filing an appeal, instead saying [...] "I appeal to God and he hears me." [...] After she was sentenced, she urged forgiveness and asked the public not to take any action in retaliation. She stated, [...] "forgive everybody <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>case,</b> please... Don't get angry. If I'm not angry, why should anyone else be?" [...] In a notably gracious exchange between the bestower and recipient of an 80+ year sentence [...] of incarceration, the judge wished her [...] "the very best going forward", and both Siddiqui [...] and the judge thanked each other.|$|E

He wrote about the experience in a newspaper article titled [...] "A Cat in a Wild World".|$|E
2500|$|Viewed {{with some}} {{suspicion}} by the communist authorities, Zigu Ornea was progressively marginalized {{during the late}} 1950s. He was expelled from ESLPA {{at the same time}} as art historian and critic Dan Grigorescu, both of them for having [...] "bourgeois" [...] origins. According to his friend, publisher Tiberiu Avramescu, Ornea felt himself being pressured by the regime's representatives into leaving for Israel, but rejected the notion and argued: [...] "I shan't give up, this is my country." [...] Speaking later about [...] "latent antisemitism" [...] and forms of [...] "aggressive intolerance" [...] in postwar Romania, the literary historian noted: [...] "being born a Jew was not a detail <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>case,</b> but [...] a state and a permanent wound that I have been feeling acutely, ceaselessly".|$|E
2500|$|Shindo is most {{remembered for}} the albums he {{recorded}} featuring {{a mix of}} eastern and western musical styles and instrumentation.

[...] His albums won favor with listeners of music in the exotica genre that also included artists Martin Denny, Les Baxter and Arthur Lyman. [...] The popularity of exotica peaked in 1959 as Denny's album [...] "Exotica" [...] spent five weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard album chart and was the No. 3 {{album of the year}} according to Billboard. Shindo later recalled what attracted him to the style: [...] "Everyone is looking for a style.
