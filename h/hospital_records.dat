5|$|A {{native of}} Ohio, Gottesman studied {{psychology}} for his {{undergraduate and graduate}} degrees, became {{a faculty member at}} various universities, and spent most of his career at the University of Virginia and the University of Minnesota. He is known for researching schizophrenia in identical twins to document the contributions of genetics and the family, social, cultural, and economic environment to the onset, progress, and inter-generational transmission of the disorder. Gottesman has worked with researchers to analyze <b>hospital</b> <b>records</b> and conduct follow-up interviews of twins where one or both were schizophrenic. He has also researched the effects of genetics and the environment on human violence and variations in human intelligence. Gottesman and co-researcher James Shields introduced the word epigenetics—the control of genes by biochemical signals modified by the environment {{from other parts of the}} genome—to the field of psychiatric genetics.|$|E
5|$|Pound's lawyer, Julien Cornell, whose {{efforts to}} have him {{declared}} insane are credited with having saved him from life imprisonment, requested his release at a bail hearing in January 1947. The hospital's superintendent, Winfred Overholser, agreed instead to move him to the more pleasant surroundings of Chestnut Ward, close to Overholser's private quarters, which is where {{he spent the next}} 12 years. The historian Stanley Kutler was given access in the 1980s to military intelligence and other government documents about Pound, including his <b>hospital</b> <b>records,</b> and wrote that the psychiatrists believed Pound had a narcissistic personality, but they considered him sane. Kutler believes that Overholser protected Pound from the criminal justice system because he was fascinated by him.|$|E

40|$|SummaryObjectivesThe {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to assess the case ascertainment and completeness of neonatal tetanus (NT) reporting and to estimate the incidence of NT in Dadu District, Pakistan. MethodsWe conducted active surveillance and <b>hospital</b> <b>record</b> reviews for suspected NT cases. We compared the cases of NT reported to the routine surveillance system with the cases identified through the <b>hospital</b> <b>record</b> reviews for 1993 through 2003. The two-source capture–recapture method was used to evaluate case ascertainment in the routine surveillance system and to estimate the incidence of cases of NT. ResultsActive surveillance and <b>hospital</b> <b>record</b> reviews identified 134 cases in addition to 274 cases in the routine surveillance system. The two-source capture–recapture method indicated that there would have been 463 cases during this period (95 % confidence interval (CI) = 418 – 508), representing an average annual incidence of 0. 62 per 1000 live-births. The overall completeness of routine reporting was 59. 2 %. The proportions of cases reported were 68. 1 % for government hospitals and 53. 8 % for private reporting sites. ConclusionsReporting of NT cases is incomplete. Active promotion of private sector participation, community involvement, and strengthening of the government sector as a way of improving NT reporting and surveillance is strongly suggested...|$|R

25|$|He {{began his}} career as a bone surgeon at New York Cancer Hospital (which later became part of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center); however, he became more {{interested}} in cancer treatment when one of his early patients, Elizabeth Dashiell, died from bone cancer. While going through <b>hospital</b> <b>records,</b> Coley found a sarcoma case study of one patient named Fred Stein, whose tumor disappeared following a high fever from erysipelas infection, now known as Streptococcus pyogenes. This sparked Coley's interest and drove him to find what few examples of similar cancer treatment had been previously recorded. He discovered that other medical pioneers including Robert Koch, Louis Pasteur, and Emil von Behring, had recorded observations of erysipelas infection coinciding with cancer regression.|$|E
25|$|China {{has one of}} {{the largest}} organ {{transplant}} programs in the world. Although China does not keep nationwide statistics on transplant volume, Chinese officials estimated that over 13,000 transplants were performed in 2004, and as many as 20,000 in 2006. Some sources say the actual number of transplants is significantly higher, based on detailed analysis of <b>hospital</b> <b>records.</b> As a matter of culture and custom, however, China has extremely low rates of voluntary organ donation. Between 2003 and 2009, for instance, only 130 people volunteered to be organ donors. In 2010 the Chinese Red Cross launched a nationwide initiative to attract voluntary organ donors, but only 37 people signed up. Due to low levels of voluntary organ donation, most organs used in transplants are sourced from prisoners. The Chinese government approved a regulation in 1984 to allow the removal of organs from executed criminals, provided they give prior consent or if no one claims the body.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the U.S. Public Health Service {{published}} The International Classification of Diseases, Adapted for Indexing of <b>Hospital</b> <b>Records</b> and Operation Classification (ICDA), {{completed in}} 1962 and expanding the ICD-7 {{in a number}} of areas to more completely meet the indexing needs of hospitals. The U.S. Public Health Service later published the Eighth Revision, International Classification of Diseases, Adapted for Use in the United States, commonly referred to as ICDA-8, for official national morbidity and mortality statistics. This was followed by the ICD, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification, known as ICD-9-CM, published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and used by hospitals and other healthcare facilities to better describe the clinical picture of the patient. The diagnosis component of ICD-9-CM is completely consistent with ICD-9 codes, and remains the data standard for reporting morbidity. National adaptations of the ICD-10 progressed to incorporate both clinical code (ICD-10-CM) and procedure code (ICD-10-PCS) with the revisions completed in 2003. In 2009, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced that it would begin using ICD-10 on April 1, 2010, with full compliance by all involved parties by 2013.|$|E

500|$|Moran's {{accounts}} even altered dates. At different points, {{he claimed}} Poe {{was brought to}} the hospital on October 3 at 5 p.m., on October 6 at 9 a.m., or on October 7 (the day he died) at [...] "10 o'clock in the afternoon". For each published account, he claimed to have the <b>hospital</b> <b>records</b> as reference. A search for <b>hospital</b> <b>records</b> a century later, specifically an official death certificate, found nothing. Some critics claim Moran's inconsistencies and errors were due only to a lapse of memory, an innocent desire to romanticize, or even to senility. At the time he wrote and published his last account in 1885, Moran was 65.|$|E

[...] The study showed that 45.5 people out of 100,000 had been diagnosed with hypopituitarism, with 4.2 new cases per year. 61% were due to tumors of the pituitary gland, 9% due to other types of lesions, and 19% due to other causes; in 11% no cause could be identified.|$|E
500|$|More recent {{research}} has revealed {{that it was only}} Dr Francisco who told the news people that Elvis apparently died of heart failure. In fact, the doctors [...] "could say nothing with confidence until they got the results back from the laboratories, if then. That would be a matter of weeks." [...] One of the examiners, Dr E. Eric Muirhead [...] "could not believe his ears. Francisco had not only presumed to speak for the hospital's team of pathologists, he had announced a conclusion that they had not reached." [...] "Early on, a meticulous dissection of the body ... confirmed [...] Elvis was chronically ill with diabetes, glaucoma, and constipation. As they proceeded, the doctors saw evidence that his body had been wracked over a span of years by a large and constant stream of drugs. They had also studied his <b>hospital</b> <b>records,</b> which included two admissions for drug detoxification and methadone treatments." [...] Therefore, Frank Coffey is of the opinion that a plausible cause of Elvis' death is [...] "a phenomenon called the Valsalva maneuver (essentially straining on the toilet leading to heart stoppage— plausible because Elvis suffered constipation, a common reaction to drug use)..." [...] In similar terms, Dr Dan Warlick, who was present at the autopsy, [...] "believes Presley's chronic constipation— the result of years of prescription drug abuse and high-fat, high-cholesterol gorging— brought on what's known as Valsalva's maneuver. Put simply, the strain of attempting to defecate compressed the singer's abdominal aorta, shutting down his heart." ...|$|E
