50|$|Recall that by definition, {{mobility}} {{is dependent}} on the drift velocity. The main factor determining drift velocity (other than effective mass) is scattering time, i.e. how long the carrier is ballistically accelerated by the electric field until it scatters (collides) with something that changes its direction and/or energy. The most important sources of scattering in typical semiconductor materials, discussed below, are ionized <b>impurity</b> <b>scattering</b> and acoustic phonon scattering (also called lattice scattering).

40|$|We {{study the}} role played by electron-magnon {{scattering}} in the anomalous Hall effect. We find that it has important contributions distinct from other <b>scattering</b> processes like <b>impurities</b> <b>scattering</b> and phonon scattering. As a demonstration, we calculate the Hall conductivity for a two dimensional Dirac model. The result indicates that as system control parameter varies, the competition between magnon scattering and other types of scattering changes the Hall conductivity drastically.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{renormalization}} of a non-magnetic <b>impurity's</b> <b>scattering</b> potential {{due to the}} presence of a massless collective spin mode at a ferromagnetic quantum critical point. To this end, we compute the lowest order vertex corrections in two- and three-dimensional systems, for arbitrary scattering angle and frequency of the scattered fermions, as well as band curvature. We show that only for backward scattering in D= 2 does the lowest order vertex correction diverge logarithmically in the zero frequency limit. In all other cases, the vertex corrections approach a finite (albeit possibly large) value in the zero frequency limit. We demonstrate that vertex corrections are strongly suppressed with increasing curvature of the fermionic bands. Moreover, we show how the frequency dependence of vertex corrections varies with the scattering angle. We also discuss the form of higher order ladder vertex corrections and show that they can be classified according to the zero-frequency limit of the lowest order vertex correction. We show that even in those cases where the latter is finite, summing up an infinite series of ladder vertex diagrams can lead to a strong enhancement (or divergence) of the <b>impurity's</b> <b>scattering</b> potential. Finally, we suggest that the combined frequency and angular dependence of vertex corrections might be experimentally observable via a combination of frequency dependent and local measurements, such as scanning tunneling spectroscopy on ordered impurity structures, or measurements of the frequency dependent optical conductivity.

50|$|These two effects operate {{simultaneously}} on {{the carriers}} through Matthiessen's rule.

50|$|In quantum mechanics, ionized <b>impurity</b> <b>{{scattering}}</b> is {{the scattering}} of charge carriers by ionization in the lattice.

With no impurities and in one-dimension (1 -D), these solitons would have an infinite lifetime, a consequence of integrability. In our experiment, the added <b>impurities</b> <b>scatter</b> off the much larger soliton, contributing to its Brownian motion and decreasing its lifetime.

One obtains a model of spinless electrons which experience a half vortex when they return to the origin. As a result the conductivity is equivalent to a spinless problem with correlated noise which gives rise to anti-localization.

40|$|We {{theoretically}} calculate {{and compare}} the single-particle relaxation time (τ_s) defining quantum level broadening and the transport scattering time (τ_t) defining Drude conductivity in 2 D graphene layers {{in the presence of}} screened charged <b>impurities</b> <b>scattering</b> and short-range defect scattering. We find that the ratio τ_t/τ_s increases strongly with increasing k_F z_i and κ where k_F, z_i, and κ are respectively the Fermi wave vector, the separation of the substrate charged impurities from the graphene layer, and the background lattice dielectric constant. A critical quantitative comparison of the τ_t/τ_s results for graphene with the corresponding modulation-doped semiconductor structures is provided, showing significant differences between these two 2 D carrier systems.

50|$|Ionized Impurity: Reflects the {{deviation}} of a particle from it ballistic trajectory due to Coulomb interaction with an ionized impurity in the crystal lattice. Because {{the mass of}} an electron is relatively small {{in comparison to the}} one of an impurity, the Coulomb cross section decreases rapidly with the difference of the modulus of momentum between the initial and final state. Therefore <b>impurity</b> <b>scattering</b> events are mostly considered for intravalley scattering, intraband scattering and, to a minor extent, interband scattering.|$|E
50|$|Elastic {{scattering}} {{means that}} energy is (almost) conserved during the scattering event. Some elastic scattering processes are scattering from acoustic phonons, <b>impurity</b> <b>scattering,</b> piezoelectric scattering, etc. In acoustic phonon scattering, electrons scatter from state k to k, while emitting or absorbing a phonon of wave vector q. This phenomenon is usually modeled by assuming that lattice vibrations cause small shifts in energy bands. The additional potential causing the scattering process {{is generated by}} the deviations of bands due to these small transitions from frozen lattice positions.|$|E
40|$|Angular magnetotransport {{measurements}} {{have been}} performed to tackle {{the origin of the}} magnetoresistance in the quasi- 1 D Hollandite Ba 1. 2 Rh 8 O 16. Three samples of different impurities amount were measured. We observe that the low temperature resistivity upturn is not due to a charge density wave transition, and a dominant role of <b>impurities</b> <b>scattering</b> for low temperature transport properties is instead demonstrated. The components of magnetoresistance were separated by using the Kohler plot and the angular dependency of the resistance under magnetic field. It shows the major contribution of an isotropic, likely spin driven, negative magnetoresistance. Galvanomagnetic characteristics are then consistent with a Kondo effect and appear to be essentially 3 D at low temperature. Comment: accepted for publication in PR...|$|R
30|$|The {{three most}} {{important}} electron scattering mechanisms—longitudinal optical phonon scattering (inelastic), residual charged <b>impurities</b> <b>scattering,</b> and electron-hole scattering (both are elastic)—take place in bulk Hg 1 -xCdxTe at nitrogen temperature [5]. To calculate {{the impact of these}} scattering mechanisms on the electron mobility in QW, the linearized Boltzmann transport equation (lBTE) was iteratively solved [1]. Direct solution of lBTE allows one to account accurately inelasticity of electron scattering and recovers how carrier distribution function is perturbed by the applied electric field in the channel. Estimation of the perturbed distribution function allows one to calculate electron mobility. We have also estimated the contributions from other scattering mechanisms involving acoustic phonons, interface roughness, alloy disorder, fluctuations of composition and effective mass, which {{have been found to be}} negligible for QW widths larger than 12  nm.|$|R
40|$|We analyze two {{scattering}} mechanisms that might cause intrinsic electronic resistivity in multi-wall carbon nanotubes: <b>scattering</b> by dopant <b>impurities,</b> and <b>scattering</b> by inter-tube electron-electron interaction.

50|$|Polycrystalline {{films are}} common in {{semiconductor}} devices, as the gate electrode of a field-effect transistor is often made of polycrystalline silicon. If the polysilicon grain sizes are small, internal scattering from grain boundaries can overwhelm the effects of film-boundary scattering. Also, grain boundaries contain more impurities, which result in <b>impurity</b> <b>scattering.</b> Likewise, disordered or amorphous films will experience a severe reduction of thermal conductivity, since the small grain size results in numerous grain-boundary scattering effects. Different deposition methods of amorphous films will result in differences in impurities and grain sizes.|$|E
50|$|Other {{methods for}} {{engineering}} 2DEGs are high-electron-mobility-transistors (HEMTs) and rectangular quantum wells. HEMTs are field-effect transistors that utilize the heterojunction between two semiconducting materials to confine electrons to a triangular quantum well. Electrons {{confined to the}} heterojunction of HEMTs exhibit higher mobilities than those in MOSFETs, since the former device utilizes an intentionally undoped channel thereby mitigating the deleterious effect of ionized <b>impurity</b> <b>scattering.</b> Two closely spaced heterojunction interfaces {{may be used to}} confine electrons to a rectangular quantum well. Careful choice of the materials and alloy compositions allow control of the carrier densities within the 2DEG.|$|E
50|$|If these scatterers {{are near}} the interface, the {{complexity}} of the problem increases due to the existence of crystal defects and disorders. Charge trapping centers that scatter free carriers form in many cases due to defects associated with dangling bonds. Scattering happens because after trapping a charge, the defect becomes charged and therefore starts interacting with free carriers. If scattered carriers are in the inversion layer at the interface, the reduced dimensionality of the carriers makes the case differ from the case of bulk <b>impurity</b> <b>scattering</b> as carriers move only in two dimensions. Interfacial roughness also causes short-range scattering limiting the mobility of quasi-two-dimensional electrons at the interface.|$|E

The Boltzmann transport equation has been solved directly to account the inelasticity of optical phonon scattering. Numerical modeling showed that the intrinsic electron mobility at liquid nitrogen temperature is sufficiently low.

40|$|To {{study the}} nature of {{partially}} substituted Yb-ions in a Ce-based Kondo lattice, we fabricated high quality Ce_{ 1 -x}Yb_xCoIn_ 5 epitaxial thin films using molecular beam epitaxy. We find that the Yb-substitution leads to a linear decrease of the unit cell volume, indicating that Yb-ions are divalent forming Kondo-holes in Ce_{ 1 -x}Yb_xCoIn_ 5, and leads to a strong suppression of the superconductivity and Kondo coherence. These results, combined with the measurements of Hall effect, indicate that Yb-ions act as nonmagnetic <b>impurity</b> <b>scatters</b> in the coherent Kondo lattice without serious suppression of the antiferromagnetic fluctuations. These are {{in stark contrast to}} previous studies performed using bulk single crystals, which claim the importance of valence fluctuations of Yb-ions.
