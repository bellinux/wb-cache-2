5|$|Despite {{the harsh}} {{conditions}} on the surface, the atmospheric pressure and temperature at about 50km to 65km above {{the surface of the}} planet is nearly {{the same as that of}} the Earth, making its upper atmosphere the most Earth-like area in the Solar System, even more so than the surface of Mars. Due to the similarity in pressure and temperature and the fact that breathable air (21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen) is a lifting <b>gas</b> <b>on</b> Venus in the same way that helium is a lifting <b>gas</b> <b>on</b> Earth, the upper atmosphere has been proposed as a location for both exploration and colonization.|$|E
5|$|The {{first use}} of CS <b>gas</b> <b>on</b> the UK {{mainland}} that {{was not part of}} military training was carried out in 1944 during a hostage siege at a north London address. Soldiers were asked to throw CS grenades through the skylight in hope of bringing the incident to a speedy conclusion, but the hostage-taker had brought his civilian-issue gas mask with him, negating the effect.|$|E
5|$|Agamemnons first {{target service}} took place before her {{modifications}} were completed. On 19 March 1921, she {{was exposed to}} a cloud of poisonous gas {{to determine the effect}} of <b>gas</b> <b>on</b> a battleship. It was found that gas could penetrate the ship via her various openings, but the ship had not been sealed against gas before the trial and no accurate results applicable to a commissioned battleship could be obtained. On 21 September, she was subjected to machine-gun fire by strafing aircraft. These trials showed that such strafing could harass a battleship, but could not impair her fighting or steaming capabilities, and helped to determine protection for bridge personnel.|$|E

30|$|The {{effect of}} the shape and defect edge of SWCNT on the {{adsorption}} of O 2 and N 2 <b>gases</b> <b>on</b> the graphite has been studied theoretically by means of density functional theory coupled with cluster models [19, 20]. The calculated adsorption energy 0.26 and 1.04 kcal/mol for O 2 and N 2, respectively, physisorbed on the clean basal surface, is in good agreement with the experimental value, suggesting that the one-layer simple cluster model is {{an effective way to}} investigate the adsorption of molecular <b>gases</b> <b>on</b> the graphite surface.|$|R
40|$|The first {{experimental}} {{works for}} adsorption of <b>gases</b> <b>on</b> zeolites {{and the influence}} of molecular - sieve properties was made on natural materials by F.

The ability of adsorption properties of the zeolites is determined by two factors, character of the porous structure and the heteropolar character of the polar centers. In our research adsorption is determined with water vapor by a static - gravimetric method. The results are presented in tables and graphic dependence is represented by adsorption isotherms in Langmuir ‘s coordinates. ...|$|R
5|$|In Sanabis, {{security}} forces fled the location after protesters approached them, leaving {{one of their}} vehicles behind. Protesters attached the flag of Bahrain to the vehicle instead of damaging or burning it. In Sehla, hundreds held maghrib prayer in the streets after staging a march. In Bilad Al Qadeem, protesters held a sit-in at afternoon and started marching at evening, after which {{security forces}} intervened to disperse them. In Karzakan, protesters staged a march that was joined by another march starting in Dumistan and ended peacefully. In Duraz security forces fired tear <b>gas</b> <b>on</b> 100 protesters, breaking up their rally.|$|E
5|$|Interactions {{between the}} two {{theories}} for climate modification have also been studied, as global warming and global dimming are neither mutually exclusive nor contradictory. In a paper published on March 8, 2005 in the American Geophysical Union's Geophysical Research Letters, a research team led by Anastasia Romanou of Columbia University's Department of Applied Physics and Mathematics, New York, also showed that the apparently opposing forces of global warming and global dimming can occur at the same time. Global dimming interacts with global warming by blocking sunlight that would otherwise cause evaporation and the particulates bind to water droplets. Water vapor is the major greenhouse <b>gas.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, global dimming is affected by evaporation and rain. Rain {{has the effect of}} clearing out polluted skies.|$|E
5|$|Serpens Caput {{contains}} many RR Lyrae variables, although most are too faint {{to be seen}} without professional photography. The brightest is VY Serpentis, only of 10th magnitude. This star's period has been increasing by approximately 1.2 seconds per century. A variable star {{of a different kind}} is Tau4 Serpentis, a cool red giant that pulsates between magnitudes 5.89 and 7.07 in 87 days. This star has been found to display an inverse P Cygni profile, where cold infalling <b>gas</b> <b>on</b> to the star creates redshifted hydrogen absorption lines next to the normal emission lines.|$|E

Air pollution by gases such as SO 2, H 2 S, NO 2 and O 3 is present immediate surrounding and {{in the interior of}} cars in sufficient concns. that they must be considered for environmental qualification of modules, components, and materials. In the past, stds., pre-stds., and tech. trend documents reflected different views regarding test philosophies. In particular, the choice of noxious gases, their concns., and the necessity of combinations were disputed. Problems of noxious gas tests of materials and tech. products are illustrated. Furthermore, effects of noxious <b>gases</b> <b>on</b> model materials are shown, and as an example, a noxious <b>gas</b> test <b>on</b> model materials is described...|$|R

5|$|The {{unusually high}} {{concentration}} of oxygen <b>gas</b> <b>on</b> Earth {{is the result of}} the oxygen cycle. This biogeochemical cycle describes the movement of oxygen within and between its three main reservoirs on Earth: the atmosphere, the biosphere, and the lithosphere. The main driving factor of the oxygen cycle is photosynthesis, which is responsible for modern Earth's atmosphere. Photosynthesis releases oxygen into the atmosphere, while respiration, decay, and combustion remove it from the atmosphere. In the present equilibrium, production and consumption occur at the same rate.|$|E
5|$|Trough systems {{convert the}} heat from the sun into electricity. Because of their {{parabolic}} shape, trough collectors can focus the sun at 30-60 times its normal intensity on a receiver pipe located along the focal line of the trough. Synthetic oil circulates through the pipe and captures this heat, reaching temperatures of 390°C (735°F). The hot oil is pumped to a generating station and routed through a heat exchanger to produce steam. Finally, electricity is produced in a conventional steam turbine. The SEGS plants operate on natural <b>gas</b> <b>on</b> cloudy days or after dark, and natural gas provides 25% of the total output.|$|E

5|$|Buckingham Palace finally {{became the}} {{principal}} royal residence in 1837, on the accession of Queen Victoria, {{who was the}} first monarch to reside there; her predecessor WilliamIV had died before its completion. While the state rooms were a riot of gilt and colour, the necessities of the new palace were somewhat less luxurious. For one thing, it was reported the chimneys smoked so much that the fires had to be allowed to die down, and consequently the court shivered in icy magnificence. Ventilation was so bad that the interior smelled, and when it was decided to install gas lamps, there was a serious worry about the build-up of <b>gas</b> <b>on</b> the lower floors. It was also said that staff were lax and lazy and the palace was dirty. Following the Queen's marriage in 1840, her husband, Prince Albert, concerned himself with a reorganisation of the household offices and staff, and with the design faults of the palace. The problems were all rectified by the close of 1840. However, the builders were to return within the decade.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{similarities}} between the perpetrators, the murders were compared by Czech media and experts to a mass murder that took place two years before in Frenštát pod Radhoštěm, another Moravian town lying 90km northwards. In the attack, a 57-year-old man, Antonín Blažek, attempted {{to blow up a}} block of flats after having been ordered to vacate his flat that had been foreclosed by creditors. He first blocked both exits from the building, and then removed and opened the main gas supply into the building's corridor. Interrupted, Blažek set the <b>gas</b> <b>on</b> fire before the gas could spread throughout the whole building. The explosion and subsequent fire, however, were large enough to demolish part of the building, killing Blažek and five other people immediately and wounding eleven others, one of whom died on 17 February 2015.|$|E
5|$|Gwyneth {{stands in}} the middle of an arch and opens the rift, {{allowing}} the Gelth to cross over. The number of Gelth is much greater than anticipated, and their true motive is revealed: they intend to kill the living to give themselves more hosts and take over the planet. One of the animated bodies strangles Sneed to death, allowing another Gelth to possess his body. Dickens flees the parlour, and Rose and the Doctor are trapped in a part of the basement. Outside, Dickens realises that the beings are affected by gas and returns to the house. He extinguishes the gaslights and turns the <b>gas</b> <b>on</b> full, pulling the Gelth out of the bodies. The Doctor tells Gwyneth to send the Gelth back and close the rift, but she cannot close it or leave. Instead she takes out a box of matches, intending to ignite the gas and kill the Gelth along with herself. The Doctor determines that Gwyneth is already dead, and that by opening the rift, she had doomed herself. The Doctor, Rose, and Dickens flee the parlour just before it explodes and burns, killing Gwyneth and the Gelth.|$|E
