Compared to traditional separate PS-DSPI and SC-DSPI setups, the performance of the proposed setup is not degraded. Moreover, its versatility improves the adaptive capacity relative to measuring target variability.

40|$|We define 'failing states' {{are those}} low-income {{states in which}} policy and {{governance}} is persistently very bad.

We estimate hazard functions to establish what enhances the prospects of sustained reform. We find that a proxy for the relaxation of the binding constraints postulated in the theory is highly significant. There {{is some evidence that}} both technical capacity in the society and elite interests are particularly important. Early aid has substantial but offsetting effects: technical assistance consolidates incipient reform whereas finance chills it. NEE...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{sought to}} {{summarize}} the preliminary clinical experience of minimally invasive transthoracic device closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defects with a new delivery system without cardiopulmonary bypass. MethodsTwenty-one patients aged 11 months to 12 years (median age, 3. 6 years) with isolated perimembranous ventricular septal defects underwent minimally invasive device closure with an inferior sternotomy of 3 to 5 cm under transesophageal echocardiographic guidance. A single per–right ventricular U-like suture was established, and a new delivery system was <b>introduced,</b> <b>aided</b> by a 16 -gauge trocar, including a guidewire, proper sheath, and loading sheath. The proper size of devices was determined by means of transesophageal echocardiographic analysis, and then the device was released under real-time transesophageal echocardiographic monitoring if no significant aortic regurgitation, abnormal atrioventricular valvular motion, or residual interventricular shunt appeared. ResultsAll of the defects were successfully closed. No residual shunt, noticeable aortic or tricuspid regurgitation, or significant arrhythmias appeared during more than 5 months of follow-up. ConclusionMinimally invasive transthoracic device closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defects with a new delivery system without cardiopulmonary bypass is feasible and safe under transesophageal echocardiographic guidance. However, {{it is necessary to}} evaluate the intermediate and long-term results...|$|R
30|$|In our case, we have <b>introduced</b> {{financial}} <b>aid</b> as {{a discount}} on the sovereign debt. In turn, we introduce fiscal discipline as a constraint that limits government debt. While both are linear restrictions, {{the former is}} on a stock and the latter, on a flow, providing some flexibility to its implementation. 26 As a polar case, a burdensome discipline will make the sovereign shed any financial aid, making regions 2 and 3 empty sets. Accordingly, we focus on feasible levels of financial aid.|$|R

40|$|Clinical {{observation}} {{that people with}} Parkinson’s disease (PD) seem to have diVerent training needs from other adult client-groups in developing eVective use of aided augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) was the catalyst for this study. There is little good-quality research evidence available on the eVectiveness (or lack of eVectiveness) of aided AAC use by those with PD. One of the main aims of this preliminary study, therefore, was to elicit the experiences and attitudes of speech and language therapists in this speci� c area of their practice {{as the basis for}} future eYcacy research and clinical practice. Thirty speech and language therapists were questioned about their experience of introducing low- and high-tech AAC devices to this client-group. Of particular interest was the discovery of the factors identi� ed by the therapists as in� uencing their introduction of aided AAC to someone with PD and aVecting implementation and successful use.
