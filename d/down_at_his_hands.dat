60|$|She {{realized}} that he was slightly more bald. The familiar way in which his hair was parted on the left side agitated her. She looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> and the fact that his nails were as ill-treated as ever touched her more than his pleading shoe-shine.|$|E
60|$|Ingleby involuntarily glanced <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> and {{the girl}} noticed the scars on them, which, however, did not repel her. She also noticed the spareness of his frame, the curious {{transparency}} of his darkened skin, and the brightness of his eyes, all significant of an intensity of bodily effort. The man had been purged of grossness, moral and physical, by toil in icy water and scorching sun, and the light that shone out through his eyes was the brighter for the hardships he had undergone. He had gained more than vigour while he swung the shovel and gripped the drill with hands that bled from the blundering hammer stroke, after other men's work was done. It is possible that he had also gained more than tenacity of will.|$|E
60|$|But {{it was all}} {{he could}} do, hold its body encircled in his arms and sit there. He {{realized}} that he could not kill the dog. There was no way to do it. With his helpless hands he could neither draw nor hold his sheath-knife nor throttle the animal. He released it, and it plunged wildly away, with tail between its legs, and still snarling. It halted forty feet away and surveyed him curiously, with ears sharply pricked forward. The man looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> in order to locate them, and found them hanging on the ends of his arms. It struck him as curious that one should have to use his eyes in order to find out where his hands were. He began threshing his arms back and forth, beating the mittened hands against his sides. He did this for five minutes, violently, and his heart pumped enough blood up to the surface {{to put a stop to}} his shivering. But no sensation was aroused in the hands. He had an impression that they hung like weights on the ends of his arms, but when he tried to run the impression down, he could not find it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite sure?" [...] The {{other man}} in brown glanced meaningly <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> and Mr. Hoopdriver, {{following}} him mechanically, saw a yellow milled edge glittering in the twilight. Now your shop assistant is {{just above the}} tip-receiving class, and only just above it--so that he is acutely sensitive on the point.|$|R
6000|$|The {{lieutenant}} looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> {{and then}} he saw, for the first time, {{that there was a}} great cutlass gash across the back of it, and that his arm and shirt sleeve were wet with blood. He went aft, holding the wrist of <b>his</b> wounded <b>hand.</b> The boatswain was still at the wheel. [...] "By zounds!" [...] said the lieutenant, with a nervous, quavering laugh, [...] "I didn't know there was such fight in the villains." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I ain't much used to sech things," [...] he replied, looking <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> big <b>hands</b> {{and growing}} a little red-faced. [...] "P'raps I hadn't orter tell, {{before the rest}} o' ye." ...|$|R
50|$|At this point, Dr. Jekyll {{resolved}} to cease becoming Mr. Hyde. One night, however, the urge gripped him too strongly, {{and after the}} transformation he immediately rushed out and violently killed Sir Danvers Carew. Horrified, Dr. Jekyll tried more adamantly to stop the transformations, {{and for a time}} he proved successful by engaging in philanthropic work. One day, at a park, he considered how good a person that he had become {{as a result of his}} deeds (in comparison to others), believing himself redeemed. However, before he completed his line of thought, he looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> and realized that he had suddenly transformed once again into Mr. Hyde. This was the first time that an involuntary metamorphosis had happened in waking hours. Far from his laboratory and hunted by the police as a murderer, Mr. Hyde needed help to avoid being caught. He wrote to Lanyon (in Dr. Jekyll's hand), asking his friend to retrieve the contents of a cabinet in his laboratory and to meet him at midnight at Hastie Lanyon's home in Cavendish Square. In Lanyon's presence, Mr. Hyde mixed the potion and transformed back to Dr. Jekyll. The shock of the sight instigated Lanyon's deterioration and death. Meanwhile, Jekyll returned to his home only to find himself ever more helpless and trapped as the transformations increased in frequency and necessitated even larger doses of potion in order to reverse them. It was the onset of one of these spontaneous metamorphoses that caused Dr. Jekyll to slam his laboratory window shut in the middle of his conversation with Enfield and Utterson.|$|E
60|$|Hunter {{laughed as}} he glanced <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> hard brown <b>hands</b> and dusty attire.|$|R
6000|$|... "Papa," [...] {{she said}} to him the {{following}} morning, [...] "may I come to you?" [...] She came in, and on this occasion sat <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> right <b>hand.</b> [...] "Of course, you have been right, Papa," [...] she said.|$|R
60|$|This last {{question}} came abruptly, in harsh, trenchant tones, altogether different {{to those of}} her smooth contralto voice. He turned his eyes away from her face, and looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own <b>hands,</b> which were clasped in front of him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Still, I'm almost afraid it's {{out of the}} {{question}} now," [...] he said, looking <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> scarred <b>hands.</b> [...] "The kind of thing I have been doing the past few years spoils one's wrist. You no doubt noticed how slow I was in part of the shifting." ...|$|R
60|$|They were right, {{he was a}} great hulking fool. He {{never could}} be {{anything}} but a clod-hopper, anyway. He looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> great <b>hand,</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> short trousers, and the indecent ugliness of his horrible boots, and studied himself without mercy to himself. He acknowledged that they were hideous, but he couldn't help it.|$|R
5000|$|... he {{was raised}} from the dead, and had a glory put upon his risen body; he ascended in a glorious manner to heaven, in a cloud, and in chariots of angels, and was {{received}} there with a welcome by his Father; and is set <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> right <b>hand,</b> and crowned with glory and honour, and glorified with the glory he had with him before the world was.|$|R
6000|$|She looked <b>down</b> {{a moment}} <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> which {{continued}} {{to cover her}} own; whereupon he presently drew it back, rather restlessly folding his arms. Without answering his question she went on: [...] "Have you ever spoken of me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|While Theseus was at {{the bath}} Medea told Ægeus what he ought to do. So when Theseus {{came back into the}} hall, where the sons of Pallas were eating and {{drinking}} noisily, Ægeus stood up, and called to Theseus to sit <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> right <b>hand.</b> He added, in a loud voice, looking all round the hall: 'This is my son, Theseus, the slayer of monsters, and his is the power in the house!' ...|$|R
60|$|It fell in {{the dusk}} of the night When unco things betide, The skilly captain, the Cameron, Went down to that waterside. Canny and soft the captain went; And {{a man of the}} woody land, With the shaven head and the painted face, Went <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> right <b>hand.</b> It {{fell in the}} quiet night, There was never a sound to ken; But all of the woods to {{the right and the left}} Lay filled with the painted men.|$|R
60|$|While she {{strained}} away, {{she longed}} to move nearer to him. He bent over, looked at her knowingly. She glanced <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> left <b>hand</b> as it touched her knee. She sprang up, started noisily and needlessly to wash the dishes. He helped her. He was too lazy to adventure further--and too used to women in his profession. She {{was grateful for the}} impersonality of his talk. It enabled her to gain control. She knew that she had skirted wild thoughts.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a moment}} alone, Augustus and Rogue {{sit down in}} a tree {{to talk to one}} another. At first, Rogue is {{defensive}} and declares that no matter what her [...] "crazy mother" [...] told Augustus, she and Gambit are happy together. She explains that they, of course, have their problems, and Augustus replies that he doesn't have problems. Continuing on, Augustus states that Mystique wants Rogue to be happy, and no matter how Rogue feels for him, they should at least try to be friends, for there is so much strife in the world without the two of them fighting. He puts <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> on Rogue's shoulder, and she informs him, [...] "Mister, I wouldn't put your hand there." [...] He replies, [...] "You going to slap a suit on me for sexual harassment?" [...] Rogue replies that she isn't, and explains her power to him. He tells her not to worry about it and his eyes begin to glow. Rogue looks <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> and notices that nothing has happened to him; she asks how long <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> has been there without anything happening. He replies, [...] "Don't worry about that, either." ...|$|R

60|$|You {{would hardly}} {{have known it}} was Adam without being told. His face has got thinner this last week: he has the sunken eyes, the {{neglected}} beard of a man just risen from a sick-bed. His heavy black hair hangs over his forehead, {{and there is no}} active impulse in him which inclines him to push it off, that he may be more awake to what is around him. He has one arm {{over the back of the}} chair, and he seems to be looking <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> clasped <b>hands.</b> He is roused by a knock at the door.|$|R
60|$|Julian made no reply. His {{eyes were}} fixed upon the door. He turned away with a shudder. Bright had entered. In <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> he was {{carrying}} two gas masks. He {{came over to the}} side of the couch, and, looking <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Julian, lifted <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> and felt <b>his</b> pulse. Then, with an abrupt movement, he handed one of the masks to Fenn.|$|R
50|$|Kristen {{has gone}} for another morning {{run along the}} same path she took, but breaks off to find a curious trail. Justin has {{suddenly}} become good at woodchopping, and breaks wood in half with <b>his</b> bare <b>hands.</b> He punches a nearby tree and looks <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> Kristen has found a large cemetery of numerous individuals, all dated 1989, and the mysterious figure attacks her, only to be thwarted by her mace. Justin finds a parasite writhing about outside the back of <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> pulls it out, and returns to woodchopping before encountering Marco who tells him he is planning to ask Jaimie’s hand in marriage. Justin hears screams twice, and runs {{off in the direction}} of Kristen. Kristen believes she escaped the man, but the man catches her from behind and shoves the parasite in his mouth down hers. Marco sits with Jaimie, who tells him the financial situation. At that point Larkin and Dr. Macavire ask to see Justin since they traced Kristen’s sunglasses to him by the body of the woman he murdered last night. Jaimie and Marco run away to warn Justin, and infected Sarah looks out to see what has been going on. Justin has found Kristen’s mutilated body as the militia approach him. Justin’s pupils disappear and adopt a singular gray hue as the parasites heighten his body’s abilities. He does quick work of every militia, but not before they gun down Marco. Jaimie was kidnapped by the mysterious figure before she could reach Justin, and Justin returns to his senses as he realizes the manslaughter he committed. He apologizes to Kristen before running away. Dr. Macavire, a policeman, and Larkin appear to murder any infected individuals and kill the larvae with salt. The policeman notices a parasite sliding back up Dr. Macavire’s leg and shoots him promptly.|$|R
40|$|William Ward Watkin, {{standing}} {{on the front lawn}} outside of a white house, somewhere in France. He is wearing a suit, with vest and tie and is looking <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the ground, <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> on <b>his</b> hips. A female is seated on the stairs leading up to the house, wearing a dark dress and a white kerchief. The yard is enclosed on the right by a built-up hedgerow and a tree, and additional trees and a power line are visible in the background. Original resource is a black and white photograph...|$|R
60|$|The guards saluted {{and were}} dismissed. We mounted to the Prince's private chambers, {{in one of}} which his {{servants}} clad me in fine linen robes after a skilled physician of the household had doctored the bruises upon my thigh over which he tied a bandage spread with balm. Then I was led to a small dining-hall, where I found the Prince waiting for me as though I were some honoured guest and not a poor scribe who had wondered hence from Memphis with my wares. He caused me to sit <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> right <b>hand</b> and even drew up the chair for me himself, whereat I felt abashed. To this day I remember that leather-seated chair. The arms of it ended in ivory sphinxes and on its back of black wood in an oval was inlaid {{the name of the}} great Rameses, to whom indeed it had once belonged. Dishes were handed to us--only two of them and those quite simple, for Seti was no great eater--by a young Nubian slave of a very merry face, and with them wine more delicious than any I had ever tasted.|$|R
6000|$|SEPTEMBER 12th, Schwerin, who {{commands}} on that side, assaults accordingly; {{with the}} due steadfastness and stormfulness: throwing shells and balls {{by way of}} prelude. Friedrich, with some group of staff-officers and dignitaries, steps out on the Bubenetsch post, {{to see how this}} affair of the Ziscaberg will prosper: the Praguers thereabouts, seeing so many dignitaries, turn cannon on them. [...] "Disperse, IHR HERREN; have a care!" [...] cried Friedrich; not himself much minding, so intent upon the Ziscaberg. And could have skipt indifferently over your cannon-balls ploughing the ground,--had not one fateful ball shattered out the life of poor Prince Wilhelm; a good young Cousin of <b>his,</b> shot <b>down</b> here <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> Doubtless a sharp moment for the King. Prince Margraf Wilhelm and a poor young page, there they lie dead; indifferent to the Ziscaberg and all coming wars of mankind. Lamentation, naturally, for this young man,--Brother to the one who fell at Mollwitz, youngest Brother of the Margraf Karl, who commands in this Bubenetsch redoubt:--But we must lift our eye-glass again; see how Schwerin is prospering. Schwerin, with due steadfastness and stormfulness, after his prelude of bomb-shells, rushes on double-quick; cannot be withstood; hurls out the Praguers, and seizes their battery; a ruinous loss to them.|$|R
60|$|Just {{as he was}} {{stepping}} out of the cabaret he spied Chauvelin and Gourdon coming through the gates. They, too, had apparently made a brief halt inside the guard-room, where--as at most of the gates--a store of various disguises was always kept ready {{for the use of the}} numerous sleuth-hounds employed by the Committee of Public Safety. Here the two men had exchanged their official garments for suits of sombre cloth, which gave them the appearance of a couple of humble bourgeois going quietly about their business. Tournefort had donned an old blouse, tattered stockings, and shoes <b>down</b> <b>at</b> heel. With <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> buried in <b>his</b> breeches' pockets, he, too, turned into the long narrow Rue de l'Oursine, which, after a sharp curve, abuts on the Rue Mouffetard.|$|R
6000|$|He {{could see}} that she recoiled from it, but the old man, once having {{approached}} it, could not leave it. [...] "If everything goes well, we shall have our grip on that fellow's throat in less than forty-eight hours." [...] He looked <b>down</b> mechanically <b>at</b> <b>his</b> withered <b>hands,</b> lean and yellow like the talons of a bird, and lifted his accipitral profile with a predatory alertness. [...] "I didn't sleep very well {{the last part of the}} night, but I thought it all out. I sha'n't care whether I get there before or after judgment is rendered; all I want is to get there before he has a chance to clear out. I think I shall be able to convince Bartley Hubbard that there is a God in Israel yet! Don't you be anxious, Marcia; I've got this thing at my fingers' ends, as clear as a bell. I intend to give Bartley a little surprise!" ...|$|R
60|$|Thus then he ascended unto, {{into the}} holy paradise, {{where he was}} waited for of a {{multitude}} of the heavenly host, and of thousands of millions of the spirits of just men made perfect. So approaching the highest heavens, {{the place of the}} special presence of God, he was bid sit <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> right <b>hand,</b> in token that, for his sufferings' sake, God had made him the highest of every creature, and given him a name above every name, and commanded that at the name of Jesus now all things in heaven should bow, and promised, that at the day of judgment, all on earth, and under it, should bow too, to the glory of God the Father (Phil 2:6-11). Thus he presented himself on our behalf unto God, a sacrifice of a sweet-smelling savour, in which God resteth for ever, for that the blood of this sacrifice has always with him a pleasing and prevailing voice. It cannot be denied, it cannot be outweighed by the heaviness, circumstances, or aggravations of any sin whatsoever, of them that come unto God by him. He is always, as I said before, {{in the midst of the}} throne, and before the throne, 'a Lamb as it had been slain,' now appearing in the presence of God for us. Of the manner of his intercession, whether it was vocal or virtual, whether by voice of mouth, or merit of deed, or both, I will not determine; we know but little while here, how things are done in heaven, and we may soon be too carnal, or fantastical in our apprehensions. Intercession he makes, that is, he manages the efficacy and worth of his suffering with God for us, and is always prevalent in his thus managing of his merits on our behalf. And as to the manner, though it be in itself infinitely beyond what we can conceive while here, yet God hath stooped to our weakness, and so expressed himself in this matter, that we might somewhat, though but childishly, apprehend him (1 Cor 13:11,12). And we do not amiss if we conceive as the Word of God hath revealed; for the scriptures are the green poplar, hazel, and the chestnut rods that lie in the gutters where we should come to drink; all the difficulty is, in seeing the white strakes, the very mind of God there, that we may conceive by it.|$|R

50|$|Maze died aged 92 with a pastel in <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> {{overlooking}} <b>his</b> beloved South <b>Downs</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> home in West Sussex in 1979.|$|R
6000|$|... "He'll think I'm cheeky," [...] {{her brother}} returned, looking <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> papers {{with his back}} to her and <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> in <b>his</b> pockets.|$|R
6000|$|M. de Bellegarde looked <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> mother, passing <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> over <b>his</b> forehead, and then, tenderly, caressingly, [...] "What shall I say?" [...] he asked.|$|R
60|$|Glancing <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> {{which were}} {{discoloured}} by his late work, the Doctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. He had already glanced <b>at</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> more than once.|$|R
