25|$|Let us {{consider}} a two-class prediction problem (binary classification), {{in which the}} outcomes are labeled either as positive (p) or negative (n). There are four possible outcomes from a binary classifier. If the outcome from a prediction is p and the actual value is also p, then it is called a true positive (TP); however if the actual value <b>is</b> <b>n</b> then {{it is said to}} be a false positive (FP). Conversely, a true negative (TN) has occurred when both the prediction outcome and the actual value are n, and false negative (FN) is when the prediction outcome <b>is</b> <b>n</b> while the actual value is p.|$|E

Only five of the 11 species of giant senecio {{and three of the}} 21 species of giant lobelia from eastern Africa remain uncounted. Although both groups are polyploid, Dendrosenecio is presumed to be decaploid (ten sets; 10x) and the Lobelia more certainly tetraploid (four sets; 4x), their adaptive radiations involved no further change in {{chromosome number}}. The cytological uniformity within each group, while providing circumstantial evidence that they descended from a single ancestor and simplifying interpretations of cladistic analyses, provides neither positive nor negative support for a possible role of polyploidy in evolving the giant-rosette growth-form.|$|E

In the population standard deviation formula, the denominator <b>is</b> <b>N</b> instead of N-1.
