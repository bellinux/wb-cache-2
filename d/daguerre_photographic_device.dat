50|$|Instead of {{painting}} a surreal universe, the Sottorealist {{is interested in}} crawling {{beneath the surface of}} reality. While the world of the dream isn’t a creative act, and while no <b>photographic</b> <b>device</b> is able to fully mediate that which is beyond reality, the Sottorealist acknowledges that which is given in reality. In doing so, the Sottorealist, however, also acknowledges that unseen forces are active in our perception of reality, such as memory or cultural frameworks or metaphysical. By making these numinous realities present in his work, he creates a convergence of the seen and unseen.|$|R

40|$|A {{thunderstorm}} is just passing. The dark, heavy clouds {{can still}} {{be seen in the}} distance dropping torrents of rain as it moves across the land. Behind the storm the sky is clear, white fluffy clouds trail the darker front. The sun shines brightly on a bend in a river that flows through pastoral farmland. Everything is green and lush, cleaned by the recent rain. The only evidence of the storm’s violence is a tree left standing closest to where we, the viewer, are positioned atop a hill over-looking the river valley. The tree has been stripped of many of its branches and leaves while another nearby tree has not been so lucky with only a ragged stump remaining. This is a description of Thomas Cole’s famous painting View from Mount Holyoke, Northampton, Massachusetts, after a Thunderstorm commonly known as The Oxbow, painted in 1836. Cole represents the quintessence of American landscape painting in the early 19 th century. However, over the next 200 years images of landscape would undergo massive transformations as America expanded westward, exploited natural resources, began to reconcile land use with land preservation, and now tries to grapple with the new reality of the landscape we have built for ourselves. These transformations have been well documented thanks to the unveiling, and subsequent improvement, of <b>Daguerre’s</b> <b>photographic</b> processes in 1839. Photography’s perceived closeness to objective reality not only made it the ideal tool for recording America’s landscape but also in revealing how that landscape was changing in the wake of industrial and suburban expansion.

40|$|Abstract- Automatic optical {{inspection}} (AOI) of micro {{drill bit}} {{becomes more and}} more important with the rapid expanding of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) manufacturing industry.

In order to be independent on the clamp that can guarantee the exact position of drill bit blade for photography, and reduce the cost of the AOI system, an image registration method is used to align the drill bit blade, which can also make the feature extraction much easier.

40|$|The Indian Deepsea Experiment (INDEX) was intiated in 1995, {{with the}} {{objective}} of predicting the environmental impact of nodule mining, in the Central Indian Basin. More than 20 scientists and technical staff of the National Institute of Oceanography have undertaken multi-disciplinary research on geological, biologica, physical and chemical parameters in 5 preselected areas leading to determination of the baseline conditions and selection of 2 areas as test and reference areas. Temperature and currents in the water column were also measured for different seasons from deepsea moorings deployed in the area. A benthic disturbance was simulated with a hydrautic device in an area of 3000 x 200 m over a period of 9 days during August 1997, resuspending more than 6000 cu m. of sediment. Initial post disturbance sutdies in the bottom waters, indicate that the sediment plume does not remain in the water column {{for more than a few}} days of disturbance.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to explore navigational and image-making methods in a context where maps and formal address systems have been minimally consulted in recent years. This investigation is approached by way of a research-based art project on subjective cartography, which was carried out from 2009 to 2010 during a Fulbright fellowship to Amman, Jordan. The project examines the mutability of a specific location as well as its relationship between obsolescence in cartographic resources and the photographic medium. By reaching out to Ammani residents for informal tours of the city, selected guides were asked to narrate their experiences of navigating the city by memory and then directed to point out key landmarks during this process. Later, these tours were re-memorized and landmarks were photographed as a representation of the afterimage to capture high-quality still images {{through the use of a}} large-format <b>photographic</b> <b>device.</b> These afterimages are not intended to serve as documents or memorials of Amman but rather as ruminations on the faculties of memory in an ever-changing environment. This subjective experience, or the observation of a city’s minutiae amid wayfinding, poses a series of inquiries, vis-à-vis memory-based navigation and the role of still images, as an alternative to the panoptic view of a map. The result is a meditative project considering the plasticity of an urban entity, presented as a composition of written material and large-scale photographs, fragments of the city that when viewed as a series come together as a constellation of a subjective whole.  </p...|$|R

5000|$|His first {{stint in}} India {{was marked by}} work in the {{subjects}} of botanical pharmacology, chemistry, galvanic electricity, and underwater conduction, among others. He worked on modifications to the Daniell cell {{and the use of}} tanned leather semi-permeable membranes in them. He identified the use of zinc to reduce the rusting of iron before the process of galvanizing had been established. O'Shaughnessy also analyzed the gun-cotton developed by Christian Friedrich Schönbein and recognized the role of nitrogen and correctly identified the role of sulphuric acid in removing water from the cotton. He also developed a silver chloride electrode and experimented on adding colour tones to the <b>Daguerre</b> <b>photographic</b> process. At Calcutta, {{he was a member of}} the Medical and Physical Society of Calcutta, where he published one of his first papers on medical applications of cannabis. He validated folk uses of cannabis in India, discovered new applications, and ultimately recommended cannabis for a great variety of therapeutic purposes. O'Shaughnessy established his reputation by successfully relieving the pain of rheumatism and stilling the convulsions of an infant with cannabis. He eventually popularized its use back in England. His most famous success came when he quelled the wrenching muscle spasm of tetanus and rabies with resin. While he could not cure tetanus, he observed that the cannabis mixture reduced their symptoms of spasticity and their suffering. In 1837 he published his independent design of an electric motor. In 1839, O'Shaughnessy conducted experiments on an experimental telegraphy system that he set up in the Botanical Garden at Calcutta with the assistance of Nathaniel Wallich. A length of 22 miles of wire was laid by zigzagging them over bamboo posts. In 1841, he returned to England where he introduced Cannabis indica to Western medicine and continued his scientific writings. He was a member of the London Electrical Society and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 16 March 1843. The Candidature for Election to Fellow of the Royal Society stated that he was [...] "distinguished for his acquaintance with the science of Medicine and Chemistry, eminent as a Physician and as a promoter of education among the natives of Bengal". O'Shaughnessy was a supporter of the idea of education in native languages in medicine. He also wanted locally available sources of medicine to be utilized to provide inexpensive aid. As a teacher, he took students on field trips to the Botanical Garden to introduce them to the local medicinal plants. In 1837 he prepared a Manual of Chemistry of which a thousand copies were printed for use in Calcutta. A second edition was produced in 1842. Another major book was the Bengal Dispensatory and Pharmacopeia which included an appendix on the [...] "improvement of Bengal pottery" [...] (1840) since earthenware imports from Europe were proving to be expensive. The Bengal Dispensatory included descriptions of several plant species that were made or overseen by Wallich including those of Abelmoschus longifolius, Pharbitis caerulea, Hebradendron pictorium and Garcinia pictoria.

Agreement between assessments was moderate to good for all outcomes using the prototype device (56 - 92 %) and improved using the definitive version of the device (74 - 100 %).
