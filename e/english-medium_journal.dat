Hyland 1998 a, Hyland 2004, 2005). This study explores cross-cultural variation {{in the use of}} lexical hedges and boosters in the academic discourse of non-native writers. The study is carried out on a specialized corpus of linguistics research articles published in the international journal Applied Linguistics and the national Czech <b>English-medium</b> <b>journal</b> Discourse and Interaction. The main purpose of the cross-cultural investigation is to analyze variation in the rate, distribution and choice of hedges and boosters across the rhetorical structure of research articles in order to shed light on ways in which Anglophone and Czech writers express different degrees of commitment in their assertions when striving to persuade their target readership to accept their views and claims...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{examines}} the growing phenomenon of <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals</b> in non-Anglophone countries, few of which achieve considerable international visibility {{as measured by}} inclusion in SCI and SSCI lists. The study investigates this phenomenon in Serbia, where a similar rise in <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals</b> is taking place, by exploring the views of editors of <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals</b> published in Serbia. Editors have been chosen as informants for the study because of their influential position as shapers of the practices and policies of the journals they edit and because of their privileged access to journal-related information that is not publicly available. The participants were fifteen editors of <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals</b> in Serbia {{in a range of}} disciplines. In addition to gathering bibliometric data about the participants’ journals, face-to-face interviews were conducted with five editors, and ten editors responded to a list of open-ended questions by email. This chapter reports and discusses two major themes: (i) the editors’ perspectives on the motivations behind the journals’ adoption of English and their related goals enabled by the use of English, and (ii) the editors views on the nature of their journals vis-à-vis the national/international dichotomy. It is shown that <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals</b> in Serbia constitute a diverse category, with different histories, goals and practices related to the use of English. Editors’ perspectives show that the use of English as the medium of publication is motivated by a range of goals at different levels, from local institutional goals to goals related to international exchange, as well as by both ‘push’ and ‘pull’ factors. In terms of the nature of <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals</b> on the semiperiphery, it is argued that they should be understood as a translocal phenomenon due to the knowledge flows they enable between various local contexts as well as with higher-than-local levels. The chapter closes by discussing the implications of the findings about the roles <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals</b> play in the local academic community, on the semiperiphery, and in global academic publishing...|$|R
40|$|The {{dominant}} position of English in international scholarship and increasing pressures on scholars worldwide to publish in English are now well documented (for example, Belcher 2007, Buckingham 2014, Canagarajah 2002, Curry and Lillis 2004, Ferguson et al. 2011, Flowerdew 1999 a, 1999 b, 2000, Hamel 2007,Hanauer and Englander 2013, Lillis and Curry 2006, 2010, Uzuner 2008). One of the less-explored {{consequences of this}} trend is the growth of <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals</b> in non-Anglophone countries. While the extent of Anglicization of periodicals varies across countries and disciplinary areas, with the hard sciences more prone to Anglicization than the humanities, this trend seems to be pervasive and ongoing (see, for instance, Gibbs 1995, Lillis 2012, Lillis and Curry 2010, Pérez-Llantada et al. 2011, Swales 1997). As <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals</b> are on the rise, those in local languages seem to be disappearing from the scene, as scholars increasingly publish in English rather than in their local languages. For instance, between 1999 and 2006, the numbers of papers in Spanish-language journals published in Spain decreased by half (Pérez-Llantada et al. 2011); similarly, the proportion of medical publications in Italian in the PubMed database fell by 60 per cent between 1986 and 2005, showing ‘the gradual peripheralization of Italian’ as the language of medical science (Giannoni 2008, p. 105). Giannoni (2008) also cites data showing that the entire output of Italian researchers in some areas (mathematics, food quality, chemistry) is now published in English, either in international journals or in Italian <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals.</b> As Moreno (2013) half-jokingly stated in a recent conference presentation commenting {{on the situation in}} Spain, discourse analysts must act fast if they wish to collect academic papers in local languages while they still exist, especially in hard science and technological areas...|$|R

Corpus evidence is obtained for two communities contrasted, that is English native scholars and their Spanish counterparts. Data on common authorship-related phraseological patterns retrieved with WSConcgram (Scott, 2008) from a section coded-corpus of research articles indicate that these phraseologies are section-specific, but that there are also differences in their configuration across cultures (i. e. Spanish and Anglo-American). Finally, these findings are discussed {{in view of the}} potential implications on Spanish scholars’ rhetorical strategies who need to adjust their language to the rhetorical standards of <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals</b> (Pérez- Llantada, 2012) when engaging in global debates...|$|R
40|$|English {{is often}} {{claimed to be}} the {{international}} language of science and research. Indeed Svartvik and Leech (156) include such a variety — international standard English or world standard English — in their model of Englishes. In their conception they disregard the spelling and style conventions imposed by journals. Given growing pressure for academics {{from around the world to}} publish in certain <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals,</b> the journal submission guidelines offer important information for authors. Yet, while there is increasing awareness of the burden imposed on EAL scholars in having to write scientific articles in English, little attention has been paid to the language policies of the international journals. The aim of this article is to synthesise the language policies of the economics journals referenced on the Institute for Scientific Information’s (ISI) Journal of Citation Reports (JCR) and re-examine two models of World Englishes in light of these policies. The overview shows that many journals operate on unstated assumptions of English and normative views prevail. The ensuing discussion raises issues related to intelligibility and standard, identity, prescriptivism and hegemony. Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologi...|$|R
40|$|Little {{is known}} about what an {{apprentice}} scholar in a non-Anglophone context undergoes when writing a research article for publication in <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals.</b> This study highlights "a rich notion of agency" by examining a nonnative-English-speaking graduate student's engagement with his community of practice (Lave & Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1998) as he wrote {{the first draft of}} an article in chemistry. The primary data were the student's process logs, his developing text, and his Bulletin Board System message exchanges and post-hoc interviews. The study illustrates the apprentice scholar's engagement with the local research community, the laboratory data, his own experience/practice of writing research articles (RAs), and the global specialist research community. His engagement with the global specialist research community includes a critical orientation. The article also points out the value of providing EAP pedagogical support for the critical perspectives that students like Yuan adopt, and it calls for the training of EAP-qualified professionals in non-Anglophone contexts. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{quantitative}} {{studies suggest}} that the burden researchers who use English as an additional language perceive when writing research articles (RAs) for publication in English (as L 2) is 24 % greater than the burden they perceive when they write RAs for publication in their L 1. It remains unclear precisely which aspects of research article (RA) writing in English present these writers with the greatest challenge and just why they perceive this increase in difficulty. A structured questionnaire comprising thirty-seven questions about researchers’ publication experiences in scientific journals in English and in Spanish was designed and sent out to all (n = 8, 794) Spanish postdoctoral researchers at one research-only institution and four universities in Spain, yielding responses from 1, 717 researchers. Our first results show that the discussion is the section that is perceived as more difficult to write for <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals,</b> across the four broad knowledge areas in a way that cannot be fully explained by their lower level of proficiency in English (as L 2).

40|$|Multilingual {{scholars}} located {{outside of}} Anglophone contexts face growing pressure to publish in English. Evidence from a longitudinal “text-ethnographic” study exploring how 50 psychology and education scholars in southern and central Europe {{are responding to}} such pressure indicates that individual linguistic and rhetorical competence alone are usually insufficient for securing publication in <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals.</b> Rather, scholars’ accounts demonstrate that participation in academic research networks functions as a key resource for publishing. This article examines the importance of networks and tracks how scholars gain access to and participate in them. We present ‘network histories’ that map out the network participation of four scholars, foregrounding several core dimensions: local and transnational, formal and informal, strong and weak, durable and temporary. Our findings suggest that strong, local, durable networks are crucial to enabling scholars’ participation in transnational networks, which support their publishing in both English and local languages. Findings contribute directly to our understandings about academic publishing in a global context and to broader debates about the efficacy of initiatives for increasing research collaboration such as those sponsored by the EU Framework Programmes. We conclude by briefly considering implications for supporting multilingual scholars’ publication and programmes aimed at increasing collaboration...|$|R

40|$|The {{challenge}} of publishing internationally for non-native English speakers (NNESs) is substantial, {{although there are}} conflicting accounts as to how NNES-authored texts fare in <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals</b> {{and the nature of}} the criticism levied at these texts. Collaborators from a wide variety of backgrounds and skill sets may contribute to these texts, and the aspects they focus on differ based on their profile. One of these aspects, rhetorical appropriateness, is of interest to the study of NNES writing because of difficulties authors have in adapting to the discourse-level features of English-medium academic texts. This article presents a multi-year research project exploring the rhetorical characteristics of writing produced by 10 NNES academics seeking to publish in international biomedical journals. Using a text-historical approach, the study traces the arc of 10 different research articles across multiple drafts, analyzing the processes and agents behind these drafts and the feedback received from target journals. Focusing on rhetorically significant changes made across different drafts and comments concerning linguistic issues, this paper seeks to further the understanding of English as a lingua franca within written discourse in the field of biomedicine.

40|$|Research have {{reported}} {{that one of the}} challenges faced by non-native English writers to have their research articles (RAs) accepted by <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals</b> is to fulfill the journals’ expectations in terms of linguistic aspect. In addition, non-native English writers seem to be having the problem in expressing their authorial identity which is needed to build one’s academic arguments. Therefore, this research was conducted to 1) explore whether linguistic disadvantage exists among native English writers or Thai writers in international publication, and 2) discover how the native English and Thai writers assert their identities through different rhetorical purposes of RAs. Eight university lecturers in Applied Linguistics (AL) from a few universities in Thailand were interviewed  to understand  their  views on the issues of  writing  for scholarly  publication  in  the  English  language. The findings revealed two salient emerging themes:  (1) the role of linguistic disadvantage and (2) variation in authorial identity between native English and Thai writers. The study has found that linguistic disadvantage exists among the Thai writers. The native English writers expressed their authorial identity overtly but the Thai writers deferred their authorial identity. It is suggested that teachers in Thailand emphasize more on the knowledge of linguistic aspect required in international publication and the effective use of linguistic realization of authorial identity in academic writing...|$|R

In exploring evaluation practices, the article problematizes three foundational categories in applied linguistics: (1) The treating of English as a single stable semiotic resource over which the ‘native’ speaker is attributed a privileged evaluative position; (2) The overriding transparency approach to language and communication; (3) The focus on production as distinct from uptake. ...|$|R
40|$|To {{explore how}} the global status of English {{influences}} knowledge production and circulation, this paper focuses on citations in English-medium national and <b>English-medium</b> international <b>journal</b> articles. Drawing on text, ethnographic, and corpus {{data from a}} longitudinal study in four national contexts, we argue that citation practices vary significantly along geolinguistic lines – that is, {{in terms of who}} gets cited, where and by whom – and that such differences are highly consequential. We argue that multilingual scholars face particularly difficult decisions which can in part be understood as a tension between the politics of knowledge building and knowledge measuring. We conclude by calling for greater recognition of this tension in discussions about English as an academic lingua franca and in Anglophone centre gatekeeping practices. ...|$|R
40|$|K nowing how to {{reference}} {{is important not}} only for students studying in Eng-lish-speaking countries, but also for those {{who might want to}} publish in <b>English-medium</b> <b>journals.</b> In many universities, however, it is often just assumed that students know how to reference, and approaches to teach-ing referencing are little more than a public reading of the institution’s plagiarism policy. As English language teachers, we need {{to take the lead in}} designing a coherent referencing curriculum to enable our students to authoritatively quote and paraphrase so they are better equipped to achieve their academic goals. Ironically, our theoretical under-standings have far outstripped con-ventional approaches to teaching referencing. We now know, for instance, that English language learners by and large do not plagiarize deceitfully. We know that using bits and pieces of other texts may be integral to language learning. And we know that referenc-ing is tied to our ability to establish tex-tual authority. But how do we address these issues in class? Over semesters of discussion with students about the differences between their writing cultures and my U. S. academic one, I found that difficulties with referencing are con-nected to differences in how students read and write texts. In response, I developed a new approach to teaching referencing based on establishing tex-tual authority and separating writers’ voices. Because I teach composition as a theme-based course, my referencing lessons relate to theme-based reading and writing assignments. In this article, I first present a short discussion of key theoretical ideas that inform the approach, and then I describe five lessons, four of which are integrated into the course theme of “homelessness. ” There are many reasons why I use this theme. Perhaps most important, I find that homelessness, together with poverty more generally, is a theme that i...|$|R
40|$|The study {{seeks to}} gain an {{understanding}} {{of the extent to which}} the geopolitical context affects the international academic publication practices of Indonesian academics, an under-researched population of academia in South East Asia which belongs to one of the largest country by population in the world, yet peripheral economically and linguistically, and which is in its inaugural process of escalating its publication performance internationally. By drawing on the concept of Communities of Practice (Lave and Wenger 1991; Wenger 1998), this thesis understands the international academic community as a community of practice. This thesis enquires the engagement of Indonesian scholars to the international academic communities through their publications in <b>English-medium</b> international <b>journals.</b> By adopting a mixed-method design as the methodological framework, which combines a questionnaire with 3 qualitative case studies, this thesis investigates the endeavour, the motives and the circumstances that affect these scholars’ ability to publish in <b>English-medium</b> international <b>journals.</b> The main findings of the study show that publication was constrained by: a.) shortages of material resources, such as online journals and; b.) lack of knowledge of specific strategies for research and the writing and publication for international journals. The strategies used include joint-publication, proofreading, and literature review research. Despite these findings most academics privileged publication in English/international journals compared to publication in national journals. Their motives were mainly scholarly recognition and career advancement rather than enriching the available theory in the disciplines. Another finding was that the participants who did achieve publication in international journals were those with active networks of overseas scholars; in particular, those engaged in joint-publication with Anglophone scholars were able to publish in higher-rank centre journals, while those who didn’t, published in regional journals in Asia. The implications of this research include the need for training in research publication strategies and the provision of material resources to support writing for international publication...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decades, {{publishing}} {{research in the}} international arena has become an imperative among scholars in Spain. However, many researchers experience difficulties in publishing their work in <b>English-medium</b> international <b>journals.</b> The present paper is part of a wider research project which aims at identifying, analysing and catering for the needs of Spanish researchers in English for Research Publication Purposes (ERPP). The first stage of our project involved a large-scale online survey administered to researchers at five universities and research institutions in Spain. This paper reports on the responses provided by informants from the social fields of Education, Psychology and Sociology. Taking a Spanish–English intercultural perspective, our objective is twofold: firstly, to explore the difficulties experienced by Spanish scholars in these disciplines, along with the strategies they use when publishing in English; and secondly, to identify their ERPP needs, with the prospect of developing materials and courses which will help them produce effective academic writing and publish their research internationally. The results point at a generalised need for training in specific areas of academic writing, such as the rhetorical sections of the RA and the most common problems and difficulties encountered by Spanish authors when writing their papers in English...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. We {{report an}} {{investigation}} on collaboration practices in research papers {{published in the}} most prestigious <b>English-medium</b> astrophysics <b>journals.</b> Method. We propose an evaluation method based on three numerical indicators to study and compare, in absolute terms, three different types of collaboration (international, national and local) and authors' mobility {{on the basis of}} co-authorship. Analysis. We analysed 300 randomly selected research papers in three different time periods and used the student's t-test to determine whether the paired two-sample differences observed were statistically significant or not. Results. International collaboration is more common than national and local collaboration. International, national and local authors' mobility and intra-national collaboration do not seriously affect the indicators of the principal levels of collaboration. International collaboration and authors' mobility are more relevant for authors publishing in European journals, whereas national and intra-national collaboration and national mobility are more important for authors publishing in US journals. Conclusions. We explain the observed differences and patterns in terms of the specific scope of each journal and the socio-economic and political situation in both geographic contexts (Europe and the USA). Our study provides a global picture of collaboration practices in astrophysics and its possible application to many other sciences and fields would undoubtedly help bring into focus the really big issues for overall research management and policy...|$|R

Publishing research articles in <b>English-medium</b> refereed <b>journals</b> is a challenging task for non-native English speaking (NNES) doctoral students. Limited research, however, {{has been conducted}} in the Australian context to explore publishing experiences of NNES doctoral students. Adopting a qualitative research approach with semi-structured interviews to collect data, this research investigates language-related challenges {{encountered by}} seven Vietnamese students studying doctoral programs in Australian universities and their strategies to successfully publish their research articles in English. Content analysis was adopted for data analysis and an inductive approach was used to identify themes {{that emerged from the}} data. The results show that as non-native English speakers, these Vietnamese doctoral students had difficulties in using their discipline-specific terminology, expressing ideas in English and developing ideas logically. They also had to handle paper rejection and negative comments on their language issues given by journal gatekeepers. As novice scholarly writers, they encountered additional challenges because of their insufficient knowledge of and practice in writing research articles. To get their papers published, they have developed necessary strategies such as co-authoring with supervisors, seeking linguistic assistance from native speakers, self-proofreading, and developing genre knowledge of research articles. This research project has important implications for English for Academic Purposes (EAP) programs and supportive writing programs that aim to help increase the publication outputs of NNES doctoral students in Australian universities. Future research may examine the publishing experiences of NNES doctoral students on a larger scale that allows comparisons between different linguistic groups as well as generalisation of the results to a wider population.
