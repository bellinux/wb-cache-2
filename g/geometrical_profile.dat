40|$|In this study, a {{prediction}} model based on {{finite element analysis}} is developed to predict cutting errors during the machining process of thin plates using a flexible setup configuration. The model is based on analysis of the material deformation of thin plates under the action of axial cutting forces using a specifically designed test bed to reproduce commonly used flexible setup in industry. The cutting process is simplified as a static analysis of the material deformation under {{the effect of the}} applied cutting forces. In the analysis, different positions of the cutting tool during the machining process are studied to determine the workpiece’s <b>geometrical</b> <b>profiles</b> during milling. Several analyses are carried out for different positions of the cutting tool. The cutting force is also modeled to predict the cutting force for specific cutting conditions. This cutting force model is utilized as input to the finite element analysis of the material deformation of the workpiece during the machining process. The experimental system is also designed to conduct tests with different cutting conditions on the three-axis Huron K 2 X 10 CNC milling machine to verify the predicted results obtained from the analysis model. The geometrical errors of the machined plates after machining are determined by using the Mitutoyo Bright Strato Coordinate Measurement Machine (CMM) to measure their <b>geometrical</b> <b>profiles</b> before and after machining processes. Finally, the mirror technique is utilized to compensate cutting deviations based on the predicted results of the workpiece’s displacements. Adding the value from the prediction model to the designed cutting depth creates the updated tool path.

In order to increase the resistance of such components to initiation and early growth of fatigue cracks, especially in the presence of foreign object damage, mechanical surface treatments are widely used.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a retrieval method and a {{statistical analysis of}} the bulk microphysical properties of semi-transparent ice clouds using the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). The method relies on spectral differences of cirrus emissivities in the 8 – 12 μm range and is sensitive to the effective ice crystal diameter (De) and ice water path (IWP) of up to 85 μm and 120 g m− 2 , respectively. An indication of the most frequent ice crystal habit in the cirrus has been obtained by using separately single scattering properties of column-like and aggregate-like ice crystals in the simulations. Uncertainties due to hypotheses on atmospheric parameters and ice crystal single scattering properties are discussed and the cirrus emissivity and temperature range for {{the applicability of the}} method are determined. To be sure that the cirrus only includes ice crystals, one has to restrict the cloud temperature range to TcldDe and IWP of 52 μm and 27 g m− 2 , respectively.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work {{is to develop a}} {{mathematical}} model for the knee joint under the framework of multibody system dynamics. The model is composed by two bodies: the femur, which is stationary, and the tibia, which is considered to move relative to the femur. Due to their higher stiffness compared to that of the articular cartilages, the femur and tibia are modeled as rigid bodies. The articular cartilages are modeled to be deformable structures with specific material characteristics. The main ligaments of the knee joint are included in the model as nonlinear springs. The <b>geometrical</b> <b>profiles</b> of the intervening contact anatomical structures, namely distal femur and proximal tibia, are extracted from a magnetic resonance image (MRI) and then fitted using piecewise cubic splines. Besides the gravitational force, an external force is applied at the center of mass of tibia to provide a dynamic activity to the model. When the bodies contact each other, a continuous non-linear force law is applied to calculate the contact forces as function of an indentation. The forces produced by the ligaments, together with the contact forces, are introduced into the equations of motion as external forces applied to the system. The mechanical behavior of the knee articular cartilages was evaluated using different contact laws. Computational simulations applying an external force with different amplitude values were also performed and the dynamic response of the ligaments was analyzed.

40|$|A {{model of}} the nicotinic {{acetylcholine}} receptor ion channel was elaborated based on the data from electron microscopy, affinity labeling, cysteine scanning, mutagenesis studies, and channel blockade. A restrained Monte Carlo minimization method {{was used for the}} calculations. Five identical M 2 segments (the sequence EKMTLSISVL 10 LALTVFLLVI 20 V) were arranged in five-helix bundles with various <b>geometrical</b> <b>profiles</b> of the pore. For each bundle, energy profiles for chlorpromazine, QX- 222, pentamethonium, and other blocking drugs pulled through the pore were calculated. An optimal model obtained allows all of the blockers free access to the pore, but retards them at the rings of residues known to contribute to the corresponding binding sites. In this model, M 2 helices are necessarily kinked. They come into contact with each other at the cytoplasmic end but diverge at the synaptic end, where N-termini of M 1 segments may contribute to the pore. The kinks disengage alpha-helical H-bonds between Ala 12 and Ser 8. The uncoupled lone electron pairs of Ser 8 carbonyl oxygens protrude into the pore, forming a hydrophilic ring that may be important for the permeation of cations. A split network of H-bonds provides a flexibility to the chains Val 9 -Ala 12, the numerous conformations of which form only two or three intrasegment H-bonds. The cross-ectional dimensions of the interface between the flexible chains vary essentially at the level of Leu 11. We suggest that conformational transitions in the chains Val 9 -Ala 12 are responsible for the channel gating, whereas rotations of more stable alpha-helical parts of M 2 segments may be necessary to transfer the channel in the desensitized state...|$|R

The sample has been extracted, in the V_ 606 band, from the catalog by Couch (1996). The analysis of the luminosity and <b>geometrical</b> <b>profiles,</b> carried out on 162 candidates obeying our provisional selection criteria, resulted in a list of 99 'bona fide' early-type galaxies, for which accurate total magnitudes and effective radii were computed. The comparison with the magnitudes given by Williams et al. (1996) indicates that the automated photometry tends to underestimate the total luminosity of the ellipticals. The luminosity profiles of most of galaxies in our sample follow fairly well the deVaucouleurs law (`Normal' profiles). However, a relevant fraction of galaxies, even following the deVaucouleurs law in the main body light distribution, exhibit in the inner region a flattening of the luminosity profile not attributable to the PSF (`Flat' profiles) or, in some cases, a complex (multi-nucleus) structure (`Merger' profiles). The average ellipticity of galaxies belonging to the `Flat' and `Merger' classes is found to be significantly higher than that of the `Normal' galaxies. Moreover, even taken into account the relevant uncertainty of the outer position angle profiles, the amount of isophotal twisting of HDF ellipticals turns out to be significantly larger with respect to that of the local samples.

Films were deposited at an incidence angle of 65 ° in a vacuum of 4. 0 × 10 ^- 3 Pa. Results obtained are as follows. (1) Depth profiles of the anisotropy of reflection coefficient and the anisotropy field provide the same information on the columnar grain structure. (2) Irrespective of the substrate temperature, the structures near the top surface and the substrate differ from the inner structure. The packing of columnar grains is sparse near the top surface and dense near the substrate...|$|R
