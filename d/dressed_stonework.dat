5|$|The Victoria Rooms, {{also known}} as the Vic Rooms, houses the University of Bristol's music {{department}} in Clifton, Bristol, England, on a prominent site at the junction of Queens Road and Whiteladies Road. The building, originally assembly rooms, was designed by Charles Dyer and was constructed between 1838 and 1842 in Greek revival style, and named in honour of Queen Victoria, who had acceded to the throne in the previous year. An eight column Corinthian portico surmounts the entrance, with a classical relief sculpture designed by Musgrave Watson above. The construction is of <b>dressed</b> <b>stonework,</b> with a slate roof. A bronze statue of Edward VII, was erected in 1912 {{at the front of the}} Victoria Rooms, together with a curved pool and several fountains with sculptures in the Art Nouveau style.|$|E
5|$|The castle is now {{entered through}} the 13th-century {{southern}} gatehouse, which faces towards the former deer park. This entrance was once {{protected by a}} 14th-century fortified bridge, also called a barbican, but only one set of stone arches remain, showing two surviving arrow slits in arched recesses. The south gatehouse has two drum towers {{on either side of}} a gateway, protected by a portcullis, and would have had three floors, linked to a wall walk around the castle. It would originally have been faced with <b>dressed</b> <b>stonework,</b> which has since been removed. The north gatehouse on the opposite site of the bailey originally led into the town of Launceston. The first floor of the building was probably first used as the porter's room, then by the castle's constable, and finally later as a prison.|$|E
5|$|In 1939 some paving and {{the walls}} of two unusual {{elliptical}} buildings were discovered, one atop the other. These 'elliptical' buildings were partially uncovered behind Chester's market hall, and no similar buildings {{have been found in}} other legionary fortresses. The buildings were located near the centre of the fortress and they had their own bath buildings and a range of store rooms around the outside. The presence of a second bath building is unusual because legionary fortresses generally had just one set of internal baths. Construction on the site began around AD 77 and this was confirmed by a length of lead piping, which served a central water feature or fountain, which was stamped with the name of Emperor Vespasian. The first building was a prestigious edifice made with concrete foundations and finely <b>dressed</b> <b>stonework,</b> and was probably the finest building in the entire fortress. Technically speaking it was not elliptical, but arcuate, with the central hall being formed from two intersecting arcs, and this makes it unique in the Roman Empire. Its function is unknown. There was no seating within the arcs, which precludes a theatre, and the best guess of the archaeologists was that the twelve alcoves may have contained images of the gods, with the temple being dedicated to the twelve primary gods of the Roman pantheon. Or, alternatively, the oval shape may have represented the shape of the known Roman world, but there is no supporting evidence for this.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Abbey of St Mary Magdalene, Vézelay, (consecrated 1104) has {{clusters}} of vertical shafts rising to support transverse arches and a groin vault. The <b>dressed</b> polychrome <b>stonework</b> has exquisitely detailed mouldings. East end is Gothic.|$|R
50|$|Half-timbered {{construction}} in the Northern European vernacular building style is characteristic of medieval and early modern Denmark, England, Germany, and parts of France and Switzerland, where timber was in good supply yet stone and associated skills to <b>dress</b> the <b>stonework</b> were in short supply. In half-timbered construction, timbers that were riven (split) in half provided the complete skeletal framing of the building.|$|R
25|$|The Chapelton (old) House was {{demolished}} {{in around}} 1908, possibly following a fire {{as this is}} the strong local tradition for {{the demise of the}} house. A Miss Mary McAllister may have been the last occupant of the house. Some of the <b>dressed</b> <b>stonework</b> may have been used in the building of the new house, garden and drive walls, the sides of the Chapel burn and elsewhere. The walling around the field side of the Chapel Hill mound is not entirely built with stones from Chapelton (old) House as some old building rubble was brought in from elsewhere at a much later date by the owner of Chapeltoun Mains, Mr. A. Robinson.|$|E
50|$|St John's {{is a large}} {{sandstone}} structure {{designed in}} the Gothic Revival style and built in the 19th century. It features a square tower, pinnacled spire, slate roof and <b>dressed</b> <b>stonework.</b> The architects, Goold and Hilling, {{were responsible for the}} original design and the building was opened in April 1858. In 1871 Edmund Blacket, noted for his work with Anglican churches, designed the transepts and spire.|$|E
50|$|In the grounds, to {{the south}} west of the house, there is an 18th-century stable which {{incorporates}} a late medieval barn. The south and east walls of the stable are castellated to impress those approaching from the south. The stable has a fine polygonal stone chimney, which is a rare surviving medieval find, taken from East Orchard Farm, St Athan. The Joneses acquired East Orchard Farm in 1756, but abandoned the building after stripping it of its <b>dressed</b> <b>stonework.</b>|$|E
50|$|Within {{the grounds}} of the hall was the Hullown Well or Saint's Well, a square stone structure, {{probably}} a baptismal pool, with <b>dressed</b> <b>stonework</b> measuring 18 feet long by 16 feet wide and 10 feet deep with 14 steps descending into the water. Although in poor condition, it can still be viewed. A 7 foot high medieval cross-shaft, (the Emmott Cross or Touchcross) used to stand close to the well, but was moved to Colne churchyard when the hall was demolished.|$|E
50|$|Also {{known as}} the Rotonde de l'Empereur, this group of rooms {{is located on the}} left (west) side of the {{building}} and was designed to allow secure and direct access by the Emperor via a double ramp to the building. When the Empire fell, work stopped, leaving unfinished <b>dressed</b> <b>stonework.</b> It now houses the Bibliothèque-Musée de l'Opéra de Paris (Paris Opera Library-Museum) which is home to nearly 600,000 documents including 100,000 books, 1,680 periodicals, 10,000 programs, letters, 100,000 photographs, sketches of costumes and sets, posters and historical administrative records.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was deemed}} {{significant}} [...] "as the first substantial stone commercial building" [...] built in Tonopah, for {{its association with}} businessman/banker Frank Golden, and for its architecture. It was designed and built by George E. Holesworth. Oddly, it is appreciated partly for its lack of style: [...] "The building is unique for a large stone commercial structure as it lacks the application of any formal stylistic treatment. The absence of cut and <b>dressed</b> <b>stonework</b> or trim also suggests the lack ofreadily available stone craftsmen in Tonopah {{at the time of}} its construction." ...|$|E

50|$|The house {{experienced}} {{two significant}} alterations {{during the nineteenth}} century. The first, probably completed in the late 1850s, included the entrance porch, elongated window openings at the first-floor street facade, the hip roof, extended eaves, scroll brackets, and pendants. The second, completed in about 1880, included the current entrance doors, the present fireplace mantles and the second-floor frame addition at the rear wing. Both renovations included work to update the house's appearance. The first renovation transformed the house with picturesque architectural elements associated with the Italianate architectural style popularized by Andrew Jackson Downing. The rear wing's incised detailing, bull's eye corner blocks and trim are typical of the machine produced millwork contemporary of the Eastlake architectural style. The changes illustrate the evolution of popular taste through the nineteenth century. The White-Pound house is significant under the National Register Criterion C as an important example of Lockport's mid-nineteenth-century domestic architecture. The refined masonry treatment at the house's main facade is enhanced by prominent beaded joints <b>dressed</b> <b>stonework</b> {{at the base of}} the entry porch.|$|E
5000|$|St Martha's Church (also {{known as}} St Martha-on-the-Hill) is listed grade II by Historic England under the {{statutory}} buildings' protection scheme [...] - [...] {{on the top}} of the hill [...] - [...] the building is accessible only by foot. [...] It is the only church in Surrey to be on the Pilgrims' Way and featured briefly in the 1944 film A Canterbury Tale. A 12th-century church existed here before falling into ruin by the 18th century. The church was rebuilt in 1848-50 to the designs of Henry Woodyer who incorporated many of the original 12th-century architectural features including Norman arches to the main entrance as well as zig zag moulded lancet windows on the tower. [...] The interior is a plain, restrained style with the majority of fittings of a post 1850 date, the main exception being a 12th-century font (albeit re cut in 1850). near the front entrance. Incised graffiti, often dated by year, exists on much of the exterior <b>dressed</b> <b>stonework.</b> The church believes it may have been built as a landmark or beacon to assist travellers or encourage pilgrimage to Canterbury or Winchester Cathedrals.|$|E
