25|$|Scholars {{investigating}} {{the cause of}} civil war are attracted by two opposing theories, greed versus grievance.

Scholarly analysis supports the conclusion that economic and structural factors are more important than those of identity in predicting occurrences of civil war.|$|E

25|$|The {{inhabitants}} of the regions are mainly Muslim as Pakistan is an Islamic country through which the Indus river passes and forms a major natural feature and resource are diverse in <b>ethnicity,</b> <b>religion,</b> national and linguistic backgrounds. On the northern course of the river {{in the state of}} Jammu and Kashmir in India, live the Buddhist people of Ladakh, of Tibetan stock, and the Dards of Indo-Aryan or Dardic stock and practising Islam. Then it descends into Baltistan, northern Pakistan passing the main Balti city of Skardu. A river from Dubair Bala also drains into it at Dubair Bazar. People living in this area are mainly Kohistani and speak the Kohistani language. Major areas through which the Indus river passes in Kohistan are Dasu, Pattan and Dubair. As it continues through Pakistan, the Indus river forms a distinctive boundary of ethnicity and cultures – upon the western banks the population is largely Pashtun, Baloch, and of other Iranian stock. The eastern banks are largely populated by people of Indo-Aryan stock, such as the Punjabis and the Sindhis. In northern Punjab and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, ethnic Pashtun tribes live alongside Dardic people in the hills (Khowar, Kalash, Shina, etc.), Burushos (in Hunza), and Punjabi people.|$|E

2500|$|Barbara Harff and Ted Gurr defined {{genocide}} as [...] "the {{promotion and}} execution of policies by a state or its agents which result {{in the deaths of}} a substantial portion of a group ... the victimized groups are defined primarily in terms of their communal characteristics, i.e., <b>ethnicity,</b> <b>religion</b> or nationality." [...] Harff and Gurr also differentiate between genocides and politicides by the characteristics by which members of a group are identified by the state. In genocides, the victimized groups are defined primarily in terms of their communal characteristics, i.e., <b>ethnicity,</b> <b>religion</b> or nationality. In politicides the victim groups are defined primarily in terms of their hierarchical position or political opposition to the regime and dominant groups. Daniel D. Polsby and Don B. Kates, Jr. state that [...] "... we follow Harff's distinction between genocides and 'pogroms,' which she describes as 'short-lived outbursts by mobs, which, although often condoned by authorities, rarely persist.'

40|$|Abstract. There are {{numerous}} macro and micro level determinants of {{female labor force}} participation (FLFP) counted in the literature. Besides the other explanatory factors of FLFP, diversification in <b>religion,</b> <b>ethnicity,</b> language and culture in a society may also {{play an important role}} in the explanation of FLFP. Therefore this study empirically examines the impact of religion, ethnic, linguistic, and cultural diversity on FLFP by using a cross-section data of 109 countries. We hypothesize that societies with higher level of religion, ethnic, linguistic, and cultural diversity experience higher level of FLFP via interaction across distinct <b>religions,</b> <b>ethnicities,</b> languages, and cultures. Our empirical results endorse our hypothesis for <b>religion,</b> <b>ethnicity,</b> and language except culture. This finding reveals that diversification in <b>religion,</b> <b>ethnicity,</b> and language in a country significantly and positively affects the FLFP level in that country.
