According to a report done by the GXS team in 2013, Europe is adopting government legislation encouraging businesses to adopt electronic invoicing practices. The United States has no such legislation yet but does recognize the value of this technology. The US Treasury estimated that implementing e-invoicing across the entire federal government would reduce cost by 50% and save $450 million annually.|$|E

40|$|Electronic <b>Invoicing</b> <b>services</b> (e-Invoicing) {{will have}} {{a pivotal role in}} all the stages of {{handling}} Value Added Tax (VAT) for European Member States. Through a systematic introduction of e-invoicing, tax administrators will be able to implement new tools and procedures to carry out alternative controls that are less intrusive on the trading partners. Nevertheless, successful European e-invoicing implementations need to be in compliance with the corresponding European Directive 2001 / 115 /EC. Most contemporary e-Invoicing implementations are proprietary and based on EDI, thus demonstrating great deficiencies. This paper presents an open electronic invoicing system named eInvoke, based on XML, XML cryptography and Web Services, that addresses all security requirements imposed by the Directive. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2006...|$|E

Our hypothesis is that the <b>invoicing</b> of <b>services,</b> in any case, changes the job of advisor both in its practice and in its orientation. We explore this hypothesis {{on the basis of a}} survey carried out in 2008 with 300 advisors of the French "departmental" Chambers of Agriculture of 3 "Regions," Bourgogne, Franche-Comté, and Rhone-Alpes through interviews conducted with advisors. The survey results show that there is a split between two positions amongst the agents of the Chambers of Agriculture: 56 % of the agents surveyed thought the public service dimension should be reinforced whereas 44 %thought that the commercialisation dimension should be increased. The split between these two options cannot be explained by age, gender or social background. Rather, it seems to be related more directly to the positions and organisational schemes of the Chambers.

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Civilian agencies did not fully comply with statutory requirements for compiling fiscal year 2011 service contract inventories. For example, because the information is not currently readily available, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directed the 49 agencies that were required to submit inventories to defer the collection of three statutorily required data elements for each contract [...] the role the services played in achieving agency objectives, the total dollar amount <b>invoiced</b> for <b>services</b> under the contracts, and the number and work locations of contractor and subcontractor personnel. Progress, however, is being made to collect this information for future inventories. OMB directed agencies to start collecting information on the role services play in achieving agency objectives for new contracts awarded on or after March 1, 2012. A proposed Federal Acquisition Regulation rule was published in April 2011 to start collecting the remaining two data elements directly from contractors. We also found several instances where agencies significantly underreported obligations in their inventories, either because they misinterpreted or did not follow OMB guidance. For example, the General Services Administration underreported obligations by approximately $ 6. 4 billion. Without complete and accurate service contract inventories, OMB and Congress cannot meaningfully compare service contract obligations among agencies, or develop spending trends for agencies, thus limiting the overall utility of the inventories. ...|$|R
