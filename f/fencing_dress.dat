He would have come every day, if he had not been the sort of man who refuses to consult his own pleasure. We had more pupils than ever. In my leisure I taught my wife to fence. I have never seen any one so lithe and quick; or so {{beautiful}} as she looked in her <b>fencing</b> <b>dress,</b> with embroidered shoes.|$|E
50|$|The collar is {{also used}} for the {{required}} sport <b>fencing</b> <b>dress.</b> Mandarin collars feature in costumes in some notable films, where they are employed either as a futuristic style fashion or to create a distinctive appearance for sinister characters. The title character in the 1962 James Bond film Dr. No, as well as Bond's nemesis, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, both parodied by Doctor Evil in the Austin Powers series of films are depicted wearing mandarin collared shirts. The mandarin collar {{can also be found}} in the uniform of the Empire's officers in the Star Wars films.|$|E
60|$|There was a lady {{near the}} <b>fence</b> <b>dressed</b> {{in a long}} dark cloak that hid {{everything}} except her high red-heeled shoes. Her face was half covered by a black silk fringed mask, without goggles. And yet {{she did not look}} in the least as if she motored.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} a former quarry which was then {{being used as a}} {{landfill}} tip. Ernest Call M.B.E., the Director of Cleansing for Bradford City Council devised a system of controlled tipping that saw 140,000 cart loads of household waste deposited to form the characteristic banking at Odsal. The club were to be responsible for boundary <b>fencing,</b> <b>dressing</b> rooms and seated accommodation.|$|R
50|$|Since 1916 the club's {{stadium is}} at the {{intersection}} of the streets Olavarria and Luna in Capital Federal, Argentina. Its construction, <b>fencing,</b> <b>dressing</b> rooms, offices, forums, were carried out in stages and by 1930 the stadium ultimately catered for 7,500 spectators. Until 1970, the stadium's structure remained almost entirely of wood, however it was all demolished, leaving only four cement steps {{on one side of the}} field to seat the Barracas fans. In late 2004, having suffered for a long time due to the bad state of the field, extensive work was carried out which resulted in proper water drainage that allowed just over two seasons to allow the field to be in excellent condition. In 2006 the club decided to build a grandstand full of cement to the visiting public with capacity for 600 spectators. The grandstands were constructed in the same place as to where the wooden grandstands were based in the past. In 2010, the club decided to move the Hooligans base from behind the goals to the side of the field, adding four more cement steps. The stadium sits approximately 30 metres from Club Atlético Huracán's Estadio Tomás Adolfo Ducó and is also located next to La Villa of Barracas.|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of photography {{allowed for a}} greater range of social types recorded for history. A number were photographed in formal poses. One woman was photographed by the H. J. Gutiérrez agency, identified on the photo along with the photographic company's name as Herlinda Perry in Ciudad Juárez in May 1911. She is shown holding a 30-30 carbine while seated on a low <b>fence</b> <b>dressed</b> in a skirt and blouse, with crossed bandoliers and two cartridge belts around her waist. So far, nothing further is known about her. [...] Another posed photo of Maderista soldaderas shown with bandoliers and rifles, with one Herlinda González in it. The women are well turned out in dresses. Two men flank the line of soldaderas, and two children also with bandoliers and rifles kneel {{in front of the}} group. The founder of the Neutral White Cross, Elena Arizmendi Mejia was photographed as a soldadera, supposedly as a joke. She was already a prominent woman taking {{an active role in the}} revolution. The photo of her as a soldadera was published in the newspapers, and her antagonists attempted to use to say she was violating the neutrality of the medical organization. However, José Guadalupe Posada made a lithograph from the photo and published it as the cover for corridos about the revolution, titling the image [...] "La Maderista." ...|$|R

50|$|By 1993-94, United {{were back}} in the Supreme Division under Jim Fairley Jr., who spearheaded the {{formation}} of the club's Youth Section. In 1996, United won enough money in the Lotttery to fund the construction of a Centre of Excellence. They began the project in 1998, installing floodlights and <b>fencing,</b> and building <b>dressing</b> rooms and multi-activity areas. In 1997, women’s football was introduced for youngsters, and today the club has two senior teams. By 2002, Grange Park had become home to more than 200 footballers, and was promoted to the Northern Counties East League Division One. This was followed by a promotion to the Premier Division {{at the end of the}} 2003-04 season.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the dominating Cowboy baseball teams of the 1980s, the ballpark has hosted nine NCAA Regional tournaments in its history. The stadium's $200,000 lighting system, installed in 1981, was instrumental in attracting the Regionals to Stillwater. Major renovations, funded primarily by the private contributions to the Reynolds Stadium Development Fund, through the years have helped keep the stadium up-to-date. The biggest changes to the stadium have been the expanded seating, new perimeter <b>fences,</b> and new <b>dressing</b> rooms in 1993. A new clubhouse was built in June 2005 along the third base dugout. The 6200 sq ft facility cost approximately $700,000 and includes a modern locker room, lounge, and media equipment.|$|R
40|$|Small hand-knitted little cozies {{appear in}} my local neighborhood; {{overgrown}} weeds {{in an urban}} community garden become a source for materials and inspiration. These new approaches to textiles by emerging artists explore new aesthetics and explode relationships between process and material and ideas about the use for handmade objects. These artists question the use of galleries as exhibition venues, curators, and juries as judges, and commerce/consumerism around finished objects. Instead they use the street as exhibition space and blogs or flickr sites as venues to create local and global communities. KnitGirl’s work consists of knitted patches attached to telephone poles, on fences and as a cover of my car antenna. She {{is part of an}} international yarn bombing movement where traditional knitting meets graffiti culture. She records all her actions and also the neighborhood on her flickr site. Sharon Kallis works in an artist’s community garden collective, which is also outdoor gallery space, celebration, and play. She bridges on old sustainable practices of growing her own materials, but also uses weeds that overgrow things to build anything from <b>fences</b> to <b>dresses.</b> I will look at work by these two young Vancouver artists: Robin aka. KnitGirl and Sharon Kallis, and describe their ideas and philosophies. Then I will present my own ideas about how this work fits into contemporary textile art practices and emerging ideas of ‘craftivism’. How do they develop or question certain textile traditions, other art practices and philosophies...|$|R
6000|$|Monday, August 27th.--Went to Boston last Wednesday. Remarkables:--An author at the American Stationers' Company, {{slapping}} {{his hand}} on his manuscript, and crying, [...] "I'm going to publish."--An excursion aboard a steamboat to Thompson's Island, to visit the Manual Labor School for boys. Aboard the steamboat several poets and various other authors; a Commodore,--Colton, a small, dark brown, sickly man, with a good deal of roughness in his address; Mr. Waterston, talking poetry and philosophy. Examination and exhibition of the boys, little tanned agriculturists. After examination, a stroll round the island, examining the products, as wheat in sheaves on the stubble-field; oats, somewhat blighted and spoiled; great pumpkins elsewhere; pastures; mowing ground;--all cultivated by the boys. Their residence, a great brick building, painted green, and standing on the summit of a rising ground, exposed to the winds of the bay. Vessels flitting past; great ships, with intricacy of rigging and various sails; schooners, sloops, with their one or two broad sheets of canvas: going on different tacks, so that the spectator might think that there was a different wind for each vessel, or that they scudded across the sea spontaneously, whither their own wills led them. The farm boys remain insulated, looking at the passing show, within sight of the city, yet having nothing to do with it; beholding their fellow-creatures skimming by them in winged machines, and steamboats snorting and puffing through the waves. Methinks an island would be the most desirable of all landed property, for it seems like a little world by itself; and the water may answer instead of the atmosphere that surrounds planets. The boys swinging, two together, standing up, and almost causing the ropes and their bodies to stretch out horizontally. On our departure, they ranged themselves on the rails of the <b>fence,</b> and, being <b>dressed</b> in blue, looked not unlike a flock of pigeons.|$|R
