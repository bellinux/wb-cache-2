60|$|The {{question}} then concerning {{our faith in}} the existence of a God, not only as the ground of the universe by his essence, but as its maker and judge by his wisdom and holy will, appeared to stand thus. The sciential reason, the objects of which are purely theoretical, remains neutral, as long as its name and semblance are not usurped by the opponents of the doctrine. But it then becomes an effective ally by exposing the false show of demonstration, or by evincing the equal <b>demonstrability</b> of the contrary from premises equally logical [37]. The understanding meantime suggests, the analogy of experience facilitates, the belief. Nature excites and recalls it, as by a perpetual revelation. Our feelings almost necessitate it; and the law of conscience peremptorily commands it. The arguments, that at all apply to it, are in its favour; and there is nothing against it, but its own sublimity. It could not be intellectually more evident without becoming morally less effective; without counteracting its own end by sacrificing the life of faith to the cold mechanism of a worth less because compulsory assent. The belief of a God and a future state, (if a passive acquiescence may be flattered with the name of belief,) does not indeed always beget a good heart; but a good heart so naturally begets the belief, that the very few exceptions must be regarded as strange anomalies from strange and unfortunate circumstances.|$|E

50|$|The {{failure of}} these studies to {{demonstrate}} the fraternal birth order effect {{has been attributed to}} their methodological flaws. Although they utilized large adolescent samples, the low base rates of same-sex attraction and behaviour in the population resulted in sample sizes that were too small for assessing the relation of birth order to sexual orientation. The fraternal birth order effect may also have been obscured in these studies due to their use of different methods of sexual orientation classification and their imprecise measures of sibships. Ray Blanchard explained that the <b>demonstrability</b> of the fraternal birth order effect depends partly on the adequate matching of the mean family size of the homosexual and heterosexual study groups and noted that in the two studies above, the mean family size of the homosexual groups was significantly smaller than that of the heterosexual comparison groups. Specifically, heterosexual males had larger numbers of siblings overall than the homosexual males which may have obscured the analyses of group differences in older brothers and prevented the demonstration of the fraternal birth order effect. Researchers have thus emphasized the necessity of comparing groups on measures of mean family size and have suggested that, in the two studies, an alternative birth order metric that controlled for sibship size would have produced findings consistent with the fraternal birth order effect. Since the publication of Bearman and Bruckner's study in 2002, studies that used representative national probability samples and direct reports on siblings' sexual orientation have found the fraternal birth order effect.|$|E

Thirty-eight 6 -person groups with unanimous prior preference for cooperation or non-cooperation discussed a prisoner's dilemma before making a group decision. When <b>demonstrability</b> was low groups reflected the prior (either cooperative or non-cooperative) preferences of their members. When <b>demonstrability</b> was high we found that groups showed no effect of prior preference.

During the transfer phase, subjects either worked in a small group, which permitted social interaction, or viewed a video of a yolked group, which only permitted the transfer of cognitive processes.

40|$|Many {{changes have}} taken place since the SCP safety {{strategy}} was formulated; {{it needs to be}} revised or replaced. Four concepts would aid in the shift from a rigid, ecelctic, schedule-driven, all-or-nothing program to an incremental, evolving, and experimental but integrated program. These are a simple safety case, reversability, <b>demonstrability,</b> and decoupling operations of a repository from operation of reactors. A simple safety case based on containment can be made for a repository at Yucca Mountain. This containment strategy is based on the dryness of openings at Yucca Mountain, Extended Dry heat management, and long-lived containers. Reversibility is technically believable at Yucca Mountain because of extended retrievability and drift emplacement, if an MRS were co-located with the repository. Because the rock is unsaturated, extended retrievability is technically feasible at Yucca Mountain. <b>Demonstrability</b> could be improved at Yucca Mountain by planning for incremental progression toward operation and closure of a repository, possibly including a shift to underground retrievable storage. <b>Demonstrability</b> can also be improved by using natural analogs.

The {{aim of this study}} was to explore which attributes influence the implementation of the Choices logo in worksite cafeterias in the Netherlands. Questionnaires were completed by catering managers of 316 cafeterias of two large caterers in the Netherlands (response rate 49. 8 %). Attributes from the Diffusion of Innovations Theory were used to investigate whether they could predict implementation. Compatibility (consistency with the beliefs of the catering manager; OR = 1. 52), voluntariness (perception of the implementation as voluntary; OR = 0. 50), result <b>demonstrability</b> (ability to communicate the implementation; OR = 1. 52) and complexity in the sense of time (time needed for implementation; OR = 0. 70) were the best predictors for the frequency of offering fresh Choices products (all significant).

In conclusion, this study provides unique insights into which perceived attributes influence the implementation of a nutrition logo in worksite cafeterias.

The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was used to identify factors influencing the intention to adopt and continued use of internet banking customers.

40|$|Background Sensor-based {{technologies}} offer numerous {{benefits in}} hospital environments {{as they can}} be used (1) to improve efficiency defined processes and (2) to monitor their conduction in order to prevent errors. However, the impact of these technologies on the stakeholders involved such as professional ward nurses is largely unexplored. The early assessment of technology acceptance and user resistance is crucial to anticipate potential conflicts and to improve future implementation success. Objectives To understand the attitudes and intentions of usage of professional ward nurses toward sensor-based medication systems based on an adjusted extended technology acceptance model (TAM 2) in a pre-implementation stage. Design A scenario-based research design was used in a nation-wide empirical study. Settings Nurses of Australian associations/unions evaluated a scenario of a sensor-based medication support system. Participants A randomly selected sample of 579 professional ward nurses participated in this study. Methods Data were collected using an online questionnaire and explored using hierarchical regression analysis. Results The majority of nurses intend to use the system but 25 % - not voluntarily. 8 % reject the system entirely. In assessing the nurses' perceived usefulness, image, <b>demonstrability,</b> qualitative and quantitative overload as well as personal innovativeness were found to have a significant impact. Qualitative and quantitative overload also have a significant negative effect on personal innovativeness. Regarding the nurses' usage intention, we identified a significant negative influence of subjective norm, moderated by experience and a positive effect of perceived usefulness on intention to use the system. Image, qualitative and quantitative overload as well as personal innovativeness are significantly influenced by age. Conclusions Our findings support a successful implementation of medication support systems in hospitals by stating acceptance drivers and barriers. Nurses' adoption is promoted once a high degree of perceived usefulness is achieved by result <b>demonstrability,</b> a positive image of the technology and a high degree of personal innovativeness. Image and innovativeness are moderated by age, showing that an increase in age leads to an increase in user resistance toward the perceived usefulness of the envisioned medication support systems. Future studies should investigate these barriers in further stages of implementation to extend understanding of sensor-based medication system acceptance. No Full Tex...|$|E
