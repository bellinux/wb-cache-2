Molly, however, {{eventually}} left The Hurricane {{to become a}} full-time solo wrestler, taking his Hardcore Championship after whacking him with a frying pan at WrestleMania X8 on March 17, 2002 in Toronto.

5|$|Homer and Bart {{continue}} to give Lisa {{a hard time}} at home, particularly since Homer is ready to host a barbecue, complete with roast pig. On {{the day of the}} barbecue, Lisa makes gazpacho for all the guests as an alternative to meat, but the partygoers laugh <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> Enraged and deeply hurt, she climbs aboard a riding mower and drives away with the roast pig in tow. Homer and Bart chase her, but she pushes the pig off a slope and they are too late. The pig rolls through bushes, into a river, and is shot into the air by a dam spillway's suction.|$|E
5|$|In July 2015, the Beales are {{informed}} by DI Samantha Keeble (Alison Newman) {{that the police}} have a new DCI dealing {{with the murder of}} Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater), who is making an arrest. At Phil's house, Marsden knocks on his door and Phil is shocked to see her. Marsden wants to speak to Ben about Lucy's murder, but Phil slams the door <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> and then attempts to delay Marsden so Ben can flee Walford, but Ben is eventually arrested.|$|E

5|$|The fugitives {{arrive at}} Elizabeth's house, where she tends to Steve, {{in the late}} stages of his infection. One of Steve's pustules erupts <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> killing him and infecting Elizabeth. At that moment, Mulder and the Marshals raid the house and arrest her, but find Paul missing. Meanwhile, Scully traces Torrance's package to Pinck Pharmaceuticals, a major drug developer. She also finds an insect {{in the body of}} another prisoner. Dr. Osbourne, who has become infected, reveals that his team works for Pinck and are researching a dilating enzyme {{produced}} by the insect. However, the insect has a parasitic life cycle that kills its hosts. Osbourne claims that the insect and its contagion were deliberately introduced into the prison by Pinck as an experiment. He tells Scully that since she was next to him when he became infected, she may have contracted the contagion as well.|$|E
5|$|Megan's lawyer ex-husband Todd (Jeffrey Nordling) {{arrives at}} Megan's work, needing {{forensic}} testing for evidence {{that his client}} Manny Santos (Carlos Apostle), is a juvenile. Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan) greets him, and she asks Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) to help examine him. Curtis finds evidence which suggests Manny has received recent trauma to ribs and other body parts, suggesting that he’s being abused. Curtis explains to Todd that Manny is a juvenile, but {{he will not be}} able to be released back to his former home, as he is being abused there. Meanwhile, the evidence for the murderer fits a partial match to Mike, so Megan concludes that Ed is not Mike's father. She goes to visit Jen; however she slams the door <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> Megan walks into her house and finds Mike's real father Tim (Timothy Devlin), holding Ed's and Jen's baby daughter hostage. Tim takes Jen into the garden when the police arrive, so Bud shoots him in the leg and arrests him and Jen is reunited with Sophie and Mike.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Chris {{learns that}} his best customer, Herbert, has made Kyle, a neighbor's {{son and a}} bully, his new paper boy. Chris decides to confront them both but ends up getting pushed over by Kyle and laughed at by Kyle's friends {{subsequently}} returning home in tears much to Peter and Lois' concern. Peter goes to talk with Kyle who makes fun of him over and over. Unable to control his anger toward Kyle, Peter beats him up leaving Kyle bleeding and bruised. Kyle’s mother agrees not to press charges if Peter apologizes to Kyle which he reluctantly does. Kyle comments on how good bullying makes you feel which encourages Peter to become a bully. Peter splashes a {{pot of boiling water}} over Lois and makes her punch herself in the face. He also hits Stewie on his sunburned buttocks, knocks Chris out of his chair, and sticks his large butt out at Meg to fart repeatedly <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> following her backwards around the kitchen table until she finally trips and vomits on the floor at which Peter gets mad with her. When Peter also bullies his friends, such as using Joe as a marionette and pulling Cleveland's pants down, Lois points out that he is as bad as his old school bully, Randy Fulcher. Deciding he should bully him instead, Peter finds Randy who is now suffering from multiple sclerosis. Thinking, when Randy says “I have MS,” that he is bragging that he has a monkey’s scrotum, Peter is about to beat up Randy but is stopped by Chris who beats Peter up instead and finally convinces him bullying is wrong. As the event is witnessed by a wrong sounding Kermit the Frog and a wrong sounding Swedish Chef, a wrong sounding Fozzie Bear (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan) asks them if they want to hear a joke as the episode ends.|$|E
60|$|Lady Cicely throws aside her cloak. There {{is great}} gaiety <b>in</b> <b>her</b> manner. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> is paler. There {{is a bright}} spot <b>in</b> each cheek. <b>Her</b> eyes are very bright.|$|R

25|$|Two years later, Ida {{returned}} to see Freud {{and explained that}} her symptoms had mostly cleared up; that she had confronted the Ks. who confessed {{that she had been}} right all along; but that she had recently developed pains <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> Freud added the details of this to his report, but still viewed his work as an overall failure; and (much later) added a footnote blaming himself for not stressing Ida's attachment to Frau K, rather than to Herr K, her husband.|$|E
25|$|Kate Elizabeth Piper (born 12 October 1983) is an English philanthropist, {{television}} presenter {{and former}} model from Andover, Hampshire. Piper {{had hoped to}} have a full-time career in the media, but in March 2008 sulphuric acid was thrown <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> The attack, which blinded Piper in one eye, was arranged by Piper's ex-boyfriend Danny Lynch and carried out by an accomplice Stefan Sylvestre; both men were arrested and are serving life sentences {{with the possibility of}} parole in prison.|$|E
25|$|As {{an evening}} job, Charlotte starts {{working as a}} new carer for Ambrose's bed-ridden father, Arthur. Most of the {{previous}} minders have quit, and the reason soon becomes obvious: Arthur is ungrateful and rude, constantly shouting hurtful abuse at his minders, belittling their efforts to help him. Charlotte is no exception, and when she makes Arthur soup, she is rewarded by him throwing it <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>face.</b> In spite of this, Charlotte tries her best, drawing strength from her belief that to give in is giving in to the Devil.|$|E
60|$|Valerie {{turned to}} her, a faint colour {{stirring}} <b>in</b> <b>her</b> white <b>face.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Presently Kate {{came to her}} brothers. [...] "I {{am afraid}} Rose {{is going to be}} ill. She keeps talking and moaning <b>in</b> <b>her</b> sleep; <b>her</b> <b>face</b> is flushed, and her hands as hot as fire." ...|$|R
60|$|Louisa made {{no answer}} <b>in</b> words. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> spoke for her: {{she could hardly}} avoid {{thinking}} it strange.|$|R
25|$|Spot is {{notoriously}} unfriendly {{to most people}} other than Data. Commander William Riker once received serious scratches while trying to feed Spot (""). Geordi La Forge borrowed her to experience {{taking care of a}} cat, but she knocked over a vase and teapot and damaged his furniture (""). When Data asked Worf to take care of Spot, Worf proved to be allergic to her and sneezed <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> angering her (""). However, she did get along with Lieutenant Reginald Barclay, so when Data had to leave on a mission at the same time Spot's kittens were due, he persuaded Barclay {{to take care of her}} ("Genesis").|$|E
25|$|More than 20 {{additional}} {{people were}} injured in the explosion, {{one of whom was}} Addie Mae's younger sister, 12-year-old Sarah Collins, who had 21 pieces of glass embedded <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> and was blinded in one eye. In her later recollections of the bombing, Collins would recall that in the moments immediately before the explosion, she had observed her sister, Addie, tying her dress sash. Another sister of Addie Mae Collins, 16-year-old Junie Collins, would later recall that shortly before the explosion, she had been sitting {{in the basement of the}} church reading the Bible and had observed Addie Mae Collins tying the dress sash of Carol Denise McNair before she had herself returned upstairs to the ground floor of the church.|$|E
25|$|The Prince wanders {{for some}} time in the park before falling asleep at the green seat {{appointed}} by Aglaya as their meeting place. Her laughter wakes him from an unhappy dream about Nastassya Filippovna, and they talk for a long time about the letters Aglaya has received. In the letters, Nastassya Filippovna writes that she herself is in love with Aglaya and passionately beseeches her to marry Myshkin, but Aglaya interprets this as evidence that Nastassya Filippovna is in love with him herself, and demands that Myshkin explain his feelings toward her. Myshkin replies that Nastassya Filippovna is insane, that he only feels profound compassion and is not in love with her, but admits that he has come to Pavlovsk for her sake. Aglaya becomes angry, demands that he throw the letters back <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> and storms off. Myshkin reads the letters with dread, and later that day Nastassya Filippovna herself appears to him, asking desperately if he is happy, and telling him she is going away and will not write any more letters. Rogozhin escorts her.|$|E

25|$|A Redondo Beach Detective named Paul Bynum was {{assigned}} to investigate Dalton's claims as to Norris's confessions of the murders, attempted abductions, and rapes which he had confided to Dalton had occurred between June and October. Bynum initially noted that Dalton's statements as to Norris's confessions did match reports on file of several teenage girls who had been reported missing over the previous five months. In addition, the incident Norris had confided to Dalton where he claimed he and Bittaker had sprayed mace {{in the face of}} a woman, who had then been dragged into Bittaker's GMC van and raped by both men, matched a report filed in relation to an incident which occurred on September 30. In this filed report, a young woman named Robin Robeck had had mace sprayed <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> before being dragged into a van and raped by two Caucasian men in their mid-30s, before being released. Although Robeck had reported the abduction and rape to police, they had been unable to identify her assailants.|$|E
500|$|Mona Simpson {{was drawn}} {{in a way}} so {{that she has a}} little bit of Homer <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> such as the shape of her upper lip and her nose. There were several design changes because the {{directors}} were trying to make her an attractive older and younger woman, but still be [...] "Simpson-esque".|$|E
500|$|However, Thomas Seymour {{continued}} scheming {{to control}} the royal family and tried to have himself appointed {{the governor of the}} King's person. When Parr died after childbirth on 5 September 1548, he renewed his attentions towards Elizabeth, intent on marrying her. The details of his former behaviour towards Elizabeth emerged, and for his brother and the king's council, this was the last straw. In January 1549, Seymour was arrested on suspicion of plotting to marry Elizabeth and overthrow the Lord Protector. Elizabeth, living at Hatfield House, would admit nothing. Her stubbornness exasperated her interrogator, Sir Robert Tyrwhitt, who reported, [...] "I do see it <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> that she is guilty". Seymour was beheaded on 20 March 1549.|$|E

500|$|Coach Beiste's {{first solo}} number, [...] "Jolene", was called [...] "haunting" [...] by Vanity Fair Brett Berk, {{who gave it}} four stars out of five, and Slezak {{said it was a}} [...] "killer use of Dolly Parton" [...] even if [...] "Beiste isn't the strongest vocalist". Both Futterman and Kubicek noted a lack of emotion in Beiste's voice, but they also noted the emotion <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>face,</b> which Kubicek said [...] "more than made up for it". Chaney wrote that [...] "the {{execution}} felt emotionally flat" [...] and gave it a [...] "C", but West graded it a [...] "B+" [...] and said, [...] "Coach Beiste's pain..... was clear in Dot Marie Jones' sad-hearted rendition".|$|E
500|$|During shooting, Hitchcock {{was forced}} to uncharacteristically do retakes for some scenes. The final shot in the shower scene, which starts with an extreme {{close-up}} on Marion's eye and pulls up and out, proved very difficult for Leigh, since the water splashing <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> {{made her want to}} blink, and the cameraman had trouble as well since he had to manually focus while moving the camera. Retakes were also required for the opening scene, since Hitchcock felt that Leigh and Gavin were not passionate enough. Leigh had trouble saying [...] "Not inordinately" [...] for the real estate office scene, requiring additional retakes. Lastly, the scene in which the mother is discovered required a complicated coordinating of the chair turning around, Vera Miles (as Lila Crane) [...] hitting the light bulb, and a lens flare, which proved to be the sticking point. Hitchcock forced retakes until all three elements were to his satisfaction.|$|E
500|$|As an {{artificial}} construct, Cortana has no physical form or being. Cortana always {{speaks with a}} smooth female voice, and she can communicate through comm systems and project a holographic image of herself from appropriate projectors, such as Holotanks, and appears holographically as a woman. Cortana is said to resemble her creator, Dr. Catherine Halsey, with a similar attitude [...] "only unchecked by military and social protocol". In Halo: The Fall of Reach, Cortana is described as slender, with close-cropped hair and a skin hue that varies from navy blue to lavender, depending on [...] her mood. Numbers and symbols flash across her form when she is thinking. In Halo 4 Cortana has become more human in appearance with more subtle additions being added to her character model such as a gap being visible between her front teeth. Cortana was played by actress Mackenzie Mason using advanced facial rendering technology to capture movements <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>face</b> while speaking to add a more human look.|$|E
