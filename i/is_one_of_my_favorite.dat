It makes you feel like celebrating... It gives you a great feeling inside, like {{you want to go out}} and have a drink... People can't wait for the weekend." [...] Also in {{an interview}} with MTV News in late 2010, Avril Lavigne spoke about being included on the song, saying, [...] "It was really exciting because 'I'm With You' <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> songs that I've done, I always love performing it." ...|$|E
500|$|Camouflage {{researcher}} Roy Behrens cites {{and discusses}} Adaptive Coloration frequently in his writings. For example, in his Camoupedia blog, {{related to the}} book of the same name, he writes of Cott's drawings of the hind limbs of the Common frog: [...] "Reproduced above <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> drawings from what <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> books." [...] He continues [...] "What makes these drawings (and the book itself) even more interesting is that Cott (1900-1987) was not just a zoologist—he was a highly skilled scientific illustrator (these are his own pen-and-ink drawings), a wildlife photographer, and a prominent British camoufleur in World War II." [...] Still in 2011, Behrens can write of Cott's way of thinking, citing his words as models of clear and accurate explanation of the mechanisms of camouflage: [...] "As he so aptly explained it, disruptive patterns work 'by the optical destruction of what is present', while continuous patterns work 'by the optical construction of what is not present.'" ...|$|E

I think the story has a crystal purity and clarity, and it just comes to a perfect point for me". Anderson said [...] "I thought it was a terrific episode, {{especially}} the scenes in the hearing room, and the whole progression of Scully praying. How it was written and shot and how it was edited. Fabulous".|$|E

500|$|While {{accompanying}} Songz on 106 & Park when promoting, Ready, Drake {{explained the}} video, stating: [...] "The {{concept of the}} video {{is the fact that}} 'successful,' it applies to so many people that me and Trey just want to get the point across that we see ourselves and we see success in other individuals so really, it's a video about potential. It's a video about understanding that no matter what you do, there's a way to be successful doing it. It's one of those motivational videos. It actually ends with a quote from Barack Obama which <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> quotes I've ever read, so we decided {{to put it in the}} video. It's vivid." ...|$|E
500|$|Imagine co-founder Ron Howard was {{attached}} to direct the film, but turned it down after being asked by Russell Crowe to helm Cinderella Man (2004). Howard's Imagine partner Brian Grazer began {{looking for a new}} director. After Howard stepped down, Menno Meyjes contributed to Gewirtz's screenplay, and Terry George incorporated the Nazi Germany and diamond ring elements to the script. Meyjes was in negotiations to direct the film, but after he declined, Grazer thought this project was a chance to work with Spike Lee, who had already learned of Gewirtz's script. Lee said of the screenplay, [...] "I liked the script and really wanted to do it. Dog Day Afternoon,' directed by Sidney Lumet, <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> films, and this story was a contemporary take on that kind of a movie." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{was very}} exciting. I got {{to write the}} attack {{at the end of}} the episode—which was very much {{something}} that happened in the comic book series—so I knew I would be revisiting something I had already written. But as we were in the writers' room, when things started shifting which led to all this new stuff that wasn't in the comic book series, I thought that was great because it wasn't me writing the same-old same-old or rewriting something I had already done and trying to make it interesting for myself. It was really an entirely new story: getting the gang members in there and getting to write Daryl [...] which <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> characters on the show, despite the fact that he’s not in the comic book.

Thomas revealed that Majorino {{was going to be}} a series regular the previous summer, a move that pleased many fans. Asked by Michael Ausiello whether Veronica and Mac would be roommates, Thomas replied that they would not, citing that such a living arrangement would prevent Veronica from having scenes with Keith. Nevertheless, Majorino commented that Mac and Veronica's relationship would continue to be close throughout the season. [...] "The friendship with Veronica <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> parts of the entire show.

500|$|During {{the early}} stages of her career, Perry's musical style gravitated towards gospel and she aspired to be as {{successful}} as Amy Grant. At the age of 15, she heard Queen's [...] "Killer Queen," [...] which inspired her to pursue a career in music. She cites the band's frontman, Freddie Mercury, as her biggest influence and expressed how the [...] "combination of his sarcastic approach to writing lyrics and his 'I don't give a fuck' attitude" [...] inspired her music. She paid homage to the band by naming her third fragrance Killer Queen. Perry described The Beach Boys and their album Pet Sounds as having a considerable influence on her music: [...] "Pet Sounds <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> records and it influenced pretty much all of my songwriting. All of the melody choices that I make are because of Pet Sounds." [...] The singer also holds the Beatles' album The Beatles in high esteem, and described these two albums as [...] "the only things I listened to for probably two years straight." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics reacted {{positively}} {{to the character}} of Dexter. Entertainment Weeklys Josh Wolk called him [...] "the hippest-looking killer since American Psychos Patrick Bateman". The San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman said [...] "What makes the series work so well is twofold. Hall is magnificent; it's another sterling performance from him. But instead of being pent up yet emotionally explosive, like his David Fisher on [...] "Six Feet Under," [...] he's cool and calculated and entirely without compassion as Dexter. That makes him alluring, in a strange way. while Ryan found him to be [...] "among the more compelling characters on the small screen". Gilbert described Dexter as a cross between Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling, calling him a vigilante obsessive murderer with a slippery personality, but [...] "also a hero of sorts". InsidePulse.com reviewer Mathan Erhardt said that the episode did not quite meet his expectations and that [...] "to me the major flaw in the show is Dexter’s noir-esque narration", although he finished the review by saying [...] "Dexter, despite [...] flaws is yet another reason why Sunday night <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> nights to watch TV." ...|$|E

500|$|Carey then {{opted to}} record a new album, that would be {{released}} {{during the summer of}} 2009. During the later stages of the project, Carey released the title, Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel, that would serve as the singer's twelfth studio album. She explained how plans for a ballad to be released were put on hold, because a new song she had written [...] "needed to be heard". On June 9, 2009, she wrote on her official Twitter account: [...] "Seriously, this <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> songs ever. I love the whole album. I'm completely immersed in it. I can't wait for you to hear it", and announced its title as [...] "Obsessed". Later that week, The-Dream, who co-wrote the song with Carey, claimed that the song was definitely aimed at someone in particular, and that it would upset them greatly. The song was transmitted digitally to radio stations on June 16, 2009 for immediate airplay and made its debut on Chicago radio station B96 at 2:00 pm. An official remix of the song, featuring rapper Gucci Mane, premiered on the same day.|$|E

When I commit to something, I do it 100 percent, and I've never had [...] until this project. I learned a lot of great things from the past — but I always asked myself, 'If I could have my own scent, what would it be?' I wasn't worried about deadlines. It could have taken me three, four, however many years — this was my first fragrance, and I wanted to make sure that it was something I would love forever.|$|E
500|$|... "Jury Duty" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics {{and was considered}} by many critics {{to be a major}} {{step in the right direction}} for the series. Brian Marder from the New York Post wrote that, [...] " [...] was a step, if not a leap, in the right direction for the showwhich, let's be honest, is showing its fatigue and staleness; possibly nearing its end; clearly suffering without Steve Carell." [...] Craig McQuinn from The Faster Times gave the episode a positive review, calling the episode [...] "fun and surprisingly sweet." [...] McQuinn enjoyed the episode's developments, most notably the idea that both Jim and Dwight can bond as fathers and explained that he hoped the producers would not [...] "forget about it like almost every other development this season." [...] New York writer Michael Tedder complimented the writers for improving on the first half of the season and wrote that the episode felt more [...] "tightly written". He also complimented Krasinski's [...] "understated" [...] performance as well as Wilson's acting, citing the scene near the end of the episode wherein Dwight learns Angela's baby might be his. Despite this, he criticized the cold opening and the [...] "miming chill pill" [...] scene. Lizzie Fuhr from BuzzSugar gave the episode a glowing review, saying, [...] "After a solid cold opening of Andy dancing ..., the rest of this week's episode of The Office is a success. ... This <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> episodes I can remember in a long time.

He noted that the uncomfortable relationship between Liz and Wesley [...] "worked better" [...] here than previously. Sepinwall said it [...] "was a good story" [...] for Jack's character, {{and that it was}} [...] "nice" [...] to see 30 Rock [...] "fearless about mocking their future Comcast overlords as they are at making fun of NBC". The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin enjoyed Michael Sheen's return, said that every part of Liz and Wesley's story was [...] "brilliant". He observed that Jack's midlife crisis here was [...] "poignant as well as funny." [...] Overall, Rabin gave it a B+ rating, and concluded [...] "...it was a rock-solid episode". Despite enjoying Sheen's role on the show, Time contributor James Poniewozik confessed he had a problem with his story arc with Tina Fey's Liz. [...] "I assume that [...] is not going to become a permanent cast member, and so however much I might enjoy parts of this story, I can never forget that this is probably one more relationship that Liz will go through and end up at status quo ante." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad was complimentary towards the NBC/Kabletown deal, enjoyed Tracy's subplot, noting it gave the character [...] "something important to do... it also shined some new light on the Tracy Morgan character." [...] Adam Mersel for TV Guide reasoned [...] "I can officially say that almost no episode of 30 Rock falls flat for me, and this one certainly didn't [...] All in all, this <b>is</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>favorite</b> episodes of the season." [...] Paste magazine contributor Sean Gandert was favorable to it, noting [...] "I'm not sure when the last time I thought every plot in a 30 Rock episode was a winner, but 'Don Geiss, Hope and America' delivered on the exuberant claims of the episode's title". Nick Catucci of New York magazine wrote that Jack trying to fit in at Kabletown, along with his suggestion of [...] "porn for women", was [...] "meh", Liz dealing with Wesley and Tracy [...] "dealing with the world's discovery of his fidelity to his wife" [...] were all [...] "quite comfortably situated in the show's wheelhouse".|$|E

As far as influence, the way that I sing, I definitely was inspired by Mike Patton, but lyrically, I approach my songs very differently than Mike Patton does.
