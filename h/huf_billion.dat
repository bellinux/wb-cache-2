40|$|The capital {{adequacy}} regulation which came into force on 1 January 2008 for the Hungarian banking sector, {{in line with}} the Basel II directives and generally applied in the European Union, brought the novelty of distinct management of operational risk. Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, personnel and systems or from external events, which, similarly to financial risk, may result in substantial losses. The regulation allows for various methods of calculating the capital requirement. Financial institutions may opt for simpler approaches based on income indicators, or for more complex ones based on actual measures of risk. Based on the past oneyear period, it appears that the Hungarian banking system’s operational risk capital charge is significant compared to the total capital charge, with the operational risk capital charge for 2009 Q 1 amounting to <b>HUF</b> 120 <b>billion,</b> equivalent to nearly 8 % of the total capital requirements. The reported realised losses are lower than the capital requirement (approximately <b>HUF</b> 13 <b>billion</b> in 2008), but the capital charge must provide a buffer in extreme, unexpected situations, and conclusions on extreme values cannot be drawn based merely on one year of observation, therefore this discrepancy could be completely justified. Regarding institutions’ choice of approach, it can be established that larger institutions prefer more complex methods in both foreign and Hungarian practice. This {{is due to the fact}} that the introduction of more advanced approaches comes with a higher fixed cost, which larger institutions can absorb more easily over the short term, and moreover, they can take better advantage of the benefits offered.

Being less costly, yet equally efficacious and safe alternatives to originator reference products, biosimilars drive competition, promise budget savings and the opportunity for better patient-access. This paper examines the key factors and players of biosimilar competition in rheumatology in Hungary. Due to the scarcity of data, the total yearly expenditure on biologicals could only be estimated from different data sources.

The magnitude of societal benefits in terms of budget savings and health gains may result from the joint effort of policy makers, funders, physicians and patients. In rheumatology indications, biosimilar utilization could be increased by a policy supporting physician-driven interchange of the reference product to biosimilars. Also, creating a physician incentive system for broader use should be considered in order to realize the full economic advantages of biosimilars and contribute to sustainable healthcare financing in Hungary...|$|R

The second largest item is the accounts payable. Another large items are the other short term liabilities and the integrator loan which is estimated at 100 - 150 <b>billion</b> <b>HUF.</b> It depends on the market position of the company's in which measure it can use the opportunity of the accounts payable. If the firm is able to encash its customers’ liabilities effectively and with a short deadline, while it is able to negotiate a longer payment term from its suppliers, it can significantly reduce or even eliminate the need for additional funding. However, if through its weak market position it's facing with tight deadlines, it is no matter, how disciplined it is and how good course of business it has: additional funding will be necessary for it. In addition funding with accounts payable is to be said as the cheapest solution, so the weak market position also means more expensive financing. In the Hungarian agricultural sector it is typical mainly for medium-sized and large companies that they are able to dictate the terms of payment, while the micro and small enterprises the accounts payable as a financing alternative is less dominant. Therefore, our objective was to develop an agricultural structural subdivision and an effective financing model for each sector...|$|R
