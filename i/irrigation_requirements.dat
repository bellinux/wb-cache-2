In this study, eight different weather generator models were assessed and their outputs were used to estimate daily reference evapotranspiration and <b>irrigation</b> <b>requirement.</b> Two daily weather generator algorithms were combined with a monthly weather generator and/or an adjustment algorithm for low-frequency variances. Precipitation occurrence series was generated by an independent semi-empirical distribution.
