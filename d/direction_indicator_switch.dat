40|$|Summary There is {{some concern}} that vehicle <b>direction</b> <b>indicator</b> lamps with clear outer lenses make it {{difficult}} in bright, sunny conditions {{to decide whether the}} signal is on or not. This study photo-metrically evaluated, under bright, sunny conditions, both luminance contrast and colour contrast between the on and off states for <b>direction</b> <b>indicator</b> lamps that use either an amber lens or a dear lens. The results indicate that luminance contrast between the on and off states is greater for lamps using an amber lens. On the other hand, the results indicate that colour contrast between the on and off states is greater for lamps using a clear lens. Because luminance contrast {{is likely to be the}} primary variable influencing driver performance, these results suggest that using clear-lens <b>direction</b> <b>indicators</b> is likely to make it more difficult to determine, in bright, sunny conditions, whether the signal is on or not. However, the magnitude of the decrement in real-world performance with dear-lens signal lamps remains to be ascertained. ...|$|R

50|$|More modern {{aviation}} ADFs {{contain a}} small array of fixed aerials and use electronic sensors to deduce the direction using {{the strength and}} phase of the signals from each aerial. The electronic sensors listen for the trough that occurs when the antenna is {{at right angles to}} the signal, and provide the heading to the station using a <b>direction</b> <b>indicator.</b> In flight, the ADF's RMI or <b>direction</b> <b>indicator</b> will always point to the broadcast station regardless of aircraft heading, however a banked attitude can have a slight effect on the reading, the needle will still generally indicate towards the beacon, however it suffers from DIP error where the needle dips down {{in the direction of the}} turn.|$|R
5000|$|The car was {{launched}} as a two- or four-door saloon with an all-steel body {{built around a}} central steel frame, which bears a resemblance to a 1949 Ford. The wings were fully integrated into the bodywork, and the passenger cabin filled the full width of the car. At a time when competitor vehicles from Opel and Mercedes Benz were still based on conventional looking prewar designs, the interior width of the Hansa, emphasized by the inclusion of bench seats both at the back and in the front, attracted favourable press comment. The car {{was seen as a}} genuine six-seater. [...] Also noteworthy in 1949 was the separate lid that permitted the boot / trunk to be accessed from outside the car. At the other end, the bonnet / hood was hinged at the side and could be opened from either the left or the right side as necessary. Instead of traditional semaphore style <b>direction</b> <b>indicators,</b> the Hansa featured flashing lights for use as <b>direction</b> <b>indicators,</b> the flashing being replicated within the tri-functional rear lights which included within a single unit rear lights and brake lights along with the US style flashing <b>direction</b> <b>indicators.</b>|$|R
