Supporters of the excise argued that there was a difference between taxation without representation <b>in</b> <b>colonial</b> America, and a tax laid by the elected representatives of the American people.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>colonial</b> corals, growth {{results from}} the budding of new polyps. There {{are two types of}} budding, intratentacular and extratentacular.

This can form individual, separate polyps or a row of partially separated polyps sharing an elongate oral disc with a series of mouths. Tentacles grow around the margin of this elongated oral disc and not around the individual mouths. This is surrounded by a single corallite wall, {{as is the case in}} the meandroid corallites of brain corals.|$|E
