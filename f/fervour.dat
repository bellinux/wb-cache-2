5|$|Facts were {{overwhelmed}} with sound, passion substituted for arithmetic, moral indignation pumped {{up to the}} bursting point. But Mr. Diefenbaker provided the liveliest show of the election... and many listeners undoubtedly failed to notice that he was saying even less than the Prime Minister, though saying it more shrilly and with evangelistic <b>fervour...</b> Mr. Diefenbaker has chosen instead to cast himself as the humble man in a mood of protest, the common Canadian outraged by Liberal prosperity, the little guy fighting for his rights.|$|E
5|$|Samora Machel became Mozambique's first president. The Reverend Uria Simango, his wife, {{and other}} FRELIMO dissidents {{were arrested in}} 1975 and {{detained}} without trial. Within about two years, fighting resumed with the Mozambican Civil War against RENAMO insurgents plied with Rhodesian and South African military support. Industrial and social recession, Marxist-style totalitarianism, corruption, poverty, inequality and failed central planning eroded the initial revolutionary <b>fervour.</b> Peace returned only in 1992, when the nation achieved relative stability {{for the first time}} in several decades.|$|E
5|$|Troilus, however, {{after he}} had learned of his father's {{intention}} {{to go ahead and}} release Briseida and restore her to the Greeks, was overwhelmed and completely wracked by great grief, and almost entirely consumed by tears, anguished sighs, and laments, because he cherished her with the great <b>fervour</b> of youthful love and had been led by the excessive ardour of love into the intense longing of blazing passion. There was no one of his dear ones who could console him.|$|E

5|$|Despite his <b>fervour,</b> Saglio's {{negotiations}} with the local people were unsuccessful. Niomoune and Carabane were the first two villages to attempt to apply this innovative approach, but both failed. The inhabitants were reluctant to participate, and the young inexperienced promoter had to abandon some of his ethnographic theories in favour of being careful to understand the daily realities of villages. The project was eventually abandoned, and the Catholic missions house was transformed by the nuns themselves into a modern, functional building. Despite the failure of Saglio's initiative in Carabane, agritourist camps were set up over the following decade in a dozen other nearby towns.|$|E
5|$|In September 1945, Hồ {{declared}} independence {{under the}} Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) following {{the withdrawal of}} Imperial Japan, which had seized {{control of the country}} from France during the Second World War. At the time, there was a power vacuum, as both Japan and France had been decimated by the war. There was an outbreak of nationalist <b>fervour</b> in Vietnam; Tảng and Thảo joined the Vanguard Youth, an impromptu independence militia. Tảng was assigned to be the leader of the local unit, but he left the movement soon after, leaving Thảo in command. During this period, Saigon was regularly engulfed in riots.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce's staunchly Church of England {{mother and}} grandfather, alarmed at these nonconformist {{influences}} {{and at his}} leanings towards evangelicalism, brought the 12-year-old boy back to Hull in 1771. Wilberforce was heartbroken {{to be separated from}} his aunt and uncle. His family opposed a return to Hull Grammar School because the headmaster had become a Methodist; Wilberforce therefore continued his education at nearby Pocklington School from 1771 to 1776. Influenced by Methodist scruples, he initially resisted Hull's lively social life, but as his religious <b>fervour</b> diminished, he embraced theatre-going, attended balls and played cards.|$|E

5|$|After {{a series}} of {{perceived}} provocations from Prussia, culminating in the offer of the Spanish crown to the Prussian Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern, the French emperor Napoleon III declared war on 15 July 1870. Initially, this step was supported by an outbreak of patriotic <b>fervour</b> and confident expectations of victory. Bizet, along with other composers and artists, joined the National Guard and began training. He was critical of the antiquated equipment with which {{he was supposed to}} fight; his unit's guns, he said, were more dangerous to themselves than to the enemy. The national mood was soon depressed by news of successive reverses; at Sedan on 2 September, the French armies suffered an overwhelming defeat; Napoleon was captured and deposed, and the Second Empire came to a sudden end.|$|E
5|$|Alderson enjoyed {{an active}} retirement, {{becoming}} Colonel Commandant of the Royal West Kent Regiment and pursuing hunting and yachting with <b>fervour,</b> being an active master of foxhounds of the South Shropshire Hunt {{and member of}} the Royal Norfolk and Suffolk Yacht Club. He was also very concerned that the growing popularity of motor sports would result in the demise of these traditional pastimes and expended much energy promoting them. After living the last few years of his life on a houseboat moored in Oulton Broad, he died in December 1927 of a sudden heart attack at Lowestoft and was buried at Chesterton, Oxfordshire, survived by his wife. She later arranged for his private papers to be given to the nation and they are currently stored at British Library and the National Archives of Zimbabwe.|$|E
5|$|Grand Duchess Marguerite Louise and Dowager Grand Duchess Vittoria vied {{with each}} other for power. The Dowager, after a {{protracted}} battle, triumphed: The Grand Duke assigned his mother the day-to-day administration of the state. Cosimo III commenced his reign with the utmost <b>fervour,</b> attempting to salvage the sinking exchequer and allowing his subjects to petition him for arbitration in disputes. The novelty soon wore off, however. Vittoria, Cosimo having lost his taste for administration, was further empowered by admission to the Grand Duke's Consulta (Privy Council). Marguerite Louise, deprived of any political influence, went about arranging Prince Ferdinando's education and aruing with Vittoria over precedence, which only further encamped Cosimo on his mother's side. In the midst of this, on the first anniversary of Ferdinando II's death, Gian Gastone was born to the grand ducal couple.|$|E

60|$|And {{still no}} desire to drink. I possessed too many fine faiths, was living at too keen a pitch. I was a socialist, intent on saving the world, and alcohol could not give me the <b>fervours</b> that were mine from my ideas and ideals. My voice, on account of my {{successful}} writing, had added weight, or so I thought. At any rate, my reputation as a writer drew me audiences that my reputation as a speaker never could have drawn. I was invited before clubs and organisations of all sorts to deliver my message. I fought the good fight, and went on studying and writing, and was very busy.|$|R
60|$|The Poet {{does not}} answer. Sits staring before him with eyes turned inward. The Painter, the Musician: {{what did the}} years bring to them? The Stranger tells them also of all that they have lost: of the griefs and sorrows, of the hopes and fears they have never tasted, of their tears that ended in laughter, of the pain that gave {{sweetness}} to joy, of the triumphs that came {{to them in the}} days before triumph had lost its savour, of the loves and the longings and <b>fervours</b> they would never know. All was ended. The Stranger had given them what he had promised, what they had desired: the gain without the getting.|$|R
5|$|Hitler's speech signalled his {{intention}} {{to rein in the}} SA, whose ranks had grown rapidly in the early 1930s. This would not prove to be simple, however, as the SA made up a large part of Nazism's most devoted followers. The SA traced its dramatic rise in numbers in part to the onset of the Great Depression, when many German citizens lost both their jobs and their faith in traditional institutions. While Nazism was not exclusively– or even primarily– a working class phenomenon, the SA fulfilled the yearning of many unemployed workers for class solidarity and nationalist <b>fervour.</b> Many stormtroopers believed in the socialist promise of National Socialism and expected the Nazi regime to take more radical economic action, such as breaking up the vast landed estates of the aristocracy. When the Nazi regime did not take such steps, those who had expected an economic as well as a political revolution were disillusioned.|$|E
5|$|The {{action at}} Plaman Mapu {{was also a}} key factor in turning the tide of {{political}} opinion against the increasingly beleaguered Sukarno. Defeat in what was intended to be a highly publicised victory helped to break the fracturing patience of the army generals on the right and unite them against what they now saw to be the destructive force of Sukarno and the Communist Party. Tensions between the army and the Communists, already high, peaked on 30 September, when elements of the army, likely Communist, kidnapped and murdered six high-ranking army generals whom they accused of planning a CIA-sponsored coup against the President. Army Reserve Commander Suharto at Sukarno's behest took control of the army and crushed the revolt, but the damage had been done. The army blamed the revolt on the Communists, and excited an anti-leftist <b>fervour</b> among the populace that contributed to the subsequent anti-Communist Purge, where high-ranking members were executed along with hundreds of thousands of suspected collaborators with millions imprisoned. This move almost eliminated the Communists from power and left Sukarno alone and isolated.|$|E
5|$|The tale of Revanta's {{birth is}} narrated in scriptures like Vishnu Purana and Markandeya Purana. Once, Sanjna, the {{daughter}} of celestial architect Vishvakarma and wife of Surya, unable to take the <b>fervour</b> of the Sun-god, repaired to the forests to engage in devout austerities {{in the form of}} a mare. She placed her shadow Chhaya, who looked just like Sanjna in her position as Surya's wife. When Surya realised that Chhaya was not the real Sanjna, he searched for Sanjna and finally found her in the forests of Uttar Kuru. There, Surya approached Sanjna disguised as a horse. Their union produced the twin-Ashvins and Revanta. In Kurma Purana and Matsya Purana, the mother of Revanta is named Rajni, another wife of Surya. While in another chapter of Markandeya Purana, he is son of Chhaya and his brothers are the Saturn-god Shani and Savarni Manu.|$|E
5000|$|... 1996 saw {{an opening}} with Mitsubishi Ralliart at {{international}} level, seized upon with sufficient vigour to guide Burns to victory on that year's Rally New Zealand - albeit then, only a fixture within the Asia-Pacific Rally Championship and the FIA 2-Litre World Rally Cup. Even so, the fending off of such calibre competition as works-backed Subaru heavyweights Kenneth Eriksson and Piero Liatti only added gloss to an increasingly <b>fervoured</b> reputation. In 1997 {{he was driving}} a same car as his team-mate Tommi Makinen had, Group A Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VI, however it was re-badged as Carisma GT.

5000|$|In Ovid's Rome, 'the tricky {{construction}} and {{reception of the}} love letter' formed the centre of his Ars Amatoria or Art of Love: 'the love letter is situated {{at the core of}} Ovidian erotics'.The Middle Ages saw the formal development of the Ars dictaminis, including the art of the love letter, from opening to close. For salutations, 'the scale in love letters is nicely graded from [...] "To the noble and discreet lady P., adorned with every elegance, greeting" [...] to the lyrical <b>fervours</b> of [...] "Half of my soul and light of my eyes [...] [...] [...] greeting, and that delight which is beyond all word and deed to express"'. The substance similarly 'ranges from doubtful equivoque to exquisite and fantastic dreaming', rising to appeals for 'the assurance [...] "that you care for me the way I care for you"'.|$|R
5|$|There Daniel takes part in {{a number}} of experiments, {{including}} the exploration of the diminishing effects of gravity with changes in elevation, the transfusion of blood between dogs and Wilkins' attempts to create a philosophical language. Daniel soon becomes disgusted with some of the practices of the older natural philosophers (which include vivisection of animals) and visits Newton during his experiments with color and white light. They attempt to return to Cambridge, but again plague expels the students. Daniel returns to his father; however, his arrival on the outskirts of London coincides with {{the second day of the}} Fire of London. Drake, taken by religious <b>fervour,</b> dies atop his house as the King blows it up to create a fire break to prevent further spread of the fire. Soon after Drake's death, Newton and Daniel then return to Cambridge and begin lecturing.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} earlier, a healthy Nalla {{took part in}} various street theatre {{performances}} protesting against multinational corporation-driven industrialisation, {{that resulted in the}} marginalisation of the labour force. He was at odds with Kandasamy Padayatchi (Nassar), a manipulative factory owner who refused to give his workers a raise. Nalla satirically imitated Padayatchi in many of his shows. However, in an unexpected turn of events, Nalla and Padayatchi's daughter Balasaraswathi, called Bala (Kiran Rathod), fell in love with each other. Realising their chances of getting together would be slim if Padayatchi knew about their relationship, Nalla and Bala decided to elope to Kerala. Nalla boarded a bus bound for Kerala, and on his way to meet Bala, the bus crashed on a hillside leaving him scarred, disfigured, and partially paralysed for life. After recovering from his wounds, he visited Bala only to be informed by Padayatchi that his daughter was already married and has settled abroad. Padayatchi had earlier lied to Bala that Nalla died in the accident. It was also at this time that Nalla became a firm believer in kindness and love. Despite suffering from an inferiority complex due to his scarred and deformed body, Nalla performs community service and social work with renewed <b>fervour</b> while continuing to fight for union causes.|$|E

40|$|Poetry is a likening, {{even when}} no metaphor is being deployed, no simile adduced. It {{knows that it}} is a miming, and, as often as not, is {{trying to find out what}} is being mimed. Murray and Hall are alike in their having copiously stocked {{memories}} and vaults of information, which they can be prodigal in displaying. But along with what might be called epic <b>fervours</b> there are lyric austerities — and a readiness to see what understatement can do, even in the midst of abundance. If Murray’s attention is solicited by that solar wind, he knows, too, what it is to be in disdain of all theatrics: if Hall notes the exotic growths, he is also himself a sentinel of cold death. Both of them know that, however precise and abundant the run of language may be, a poet is always trafficking besides in the unsaid, if not the unsayable...|$|R
60|$|Such animating {{paragraphs}} we read in this Newspaper; and <b>fervours,</b> and eloquent sarcasm: tirades {{against the}} Mountain, frame pen of Deputy Salles; which resemble, say friends, Pascal's Provincials.

National Volunteers, whosoever is of right heart: gather in, ye National Volunteers, friends of Liberty; from our Calvados Townships, from the Eure, from Brittany, from far and near; forward to Paris, and extinguish Anarchy!

He accompanied his father to Rome where his father and uncle Cathbarr O'Donnell died of <b>fervours.</b> His aunt, Rosa [...] (the wife of Cathbarr) met and married Owen Roe O'Neill, and {{it is probable that}} O'Donnell was in her care, because both he and his cousin (also named Hugh O'Donnell), received a modest pension from Archduke Albert (governor of the Low Countries) from 1615, and were raised in Leuven where they was educated by Franciscan colleagues of Archbishop Conry. He was a page to the Infanta Isabella, daughter of King Philip III of Spain. In time he joined the service of King Philip, and was commissioned colonel of a tercio in 1632. He was killed in action when his ship engaged a French vessel in August or September 1642 and caught fire.|$|R

5000|$|In Fyodor Dostoevsky and Virginia Woolf Maze {{selected}} {{authors who}} were sceptical analysts {{of the realm}} of human motivation and conventional morality, qualities resonant with his own endeavours. The entire corpus of Virginia Woolf’s work was subject of the 1997 monograph 'Virginia Woolf; Feminism, Creativity, and the Unconscious', where Maze used psychoanalytic technique to draw together otherwise unrelated parts of the text to reveal chains of associations and something {{about the nature of the}} unconscious. Maze also collaborated with Graham White on two psychohistorical projects, with books on two prominent politicians from Roosevelt’s New Deal Cabinet. At the age of 80 he set himself to write five novels, a fantasy fiction series for young adults surrounding the adventures of Cassandra Peel. The novels present in language suitable for young audiences the Greek deities, their <b>fervours</b> and foments, using everyday characters and aspects of everyday life. [...] Unprepared to compromise on the biological foundations of our human nature, Maze exposed, like Virginia Woolf and Dostoevsky, the falseness of moralism, the brutality underlying patriotism, the possessiveness of romantic love, the conformism, propaganda and censorship of respectability, the narcissism of sentimental or fashionable views of the world and the base self-interest of their underlying motives.|$|R
40|$|Australia, last {{discovered}} {{land of the}} new worlds, {{had long}} been the object of old world desire. At {{the end of the}} nineteenth century, this desire seemed to have reached a culmination in the inauguration of the new Commonwealth of Australia. At the end of the twentieth century, this Commonwealth seems to have lost its way. This cycle of desire renewed and frustrated forms a pattern for Australian literature as it seeks to recover lost hopes, and is itself an aspect of the crisis of legitimation that presently affects the world. In this crisis, people have only three options. They can turn to the authority of the law, of any legal or verbal system that has always been and that continues to enshrine power as it is. They can rest their faith on some apocalyptic account of the future, such as the crumbling Maoist dogma of China or the religious <b>fervours</b> of America. Or they can seek to find in the past of their own communities and society a tradition with the authority to suggest a way into the future. It is the third of these paths that I am attempting tonight, but the very endeavour raises the question of whether there was ever a sound basis for hope in the experience of white settlement in Australia. ...|$|R
