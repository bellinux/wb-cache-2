40|$|With an {{emphasis}} on how weight stigma is manifested in social relationship context, this study explores two under-studied consequences of adolescent overweight, timing of first sex and subsequent intimate relationship development. The data employed come from Waves I to III of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The results indicate that overweight adolescents have significantly later onset of first sex {{and are more likely}} to enter early adulthood without any intimate relationship experience when compared to normal-weight youth. Overweight adolescents are vulnerable to <b>discriminatory</b> <b>treatments</b> such as being rejected by or having less close relationships with peers and are thus less likely to have any intimate relationship. The study contributes to the existing literature on overweight youth by revealing the critical role of prejudiced social encounters in peer relationships as the key context that hinders the development of intimate relationships from adolescence to early adulthood. Future studies should seek to understand the broader implications of poor social adjustments during adolescence for later development. ...|$|R
40|$|Indian tea has {{virtually}} lost all global markets because {{it continues to}} be traded as a commodity. The much talked about value addition is limited and rather late. Only the markets that have consumers with shallow pockets buy tea as a commodity and that share is fast depleting. The industry needs to be competitive in production, marketing, logistics and product forms. India, despite being a large producer of tea, lacks properly organized production systems in which small tea producers find a respectable place. The industry must have access to capital at globally competitive rates. The subsidies in any form are undesirable. The Indian tea industry must face the market realities, redefine its business strategies and reposition its products. The first step in that direction is a complete restructuring of the tea industry, redefining the roles of various agencies like the Tea Board and Producers’ organizations, and developing a healthy partnership with the labour. There are the problems of market access and <b>discriminatory</b> <b>treatments</b> through non-tariff trade barriers such as maximum residual limits (MRL) and social clause. ...|$|R

500|$|Finding {{accommodation}} {{was one of}} {{the greatest}} challenges faced by black travelers. Not only did many hotels, motels, and boarding houses refuse to serve black customers, but thousands of towns across the United States declared themselves [...] "sundown towns," [...] which all non-whites had to leave by sunset. Huge numbers of towns across the country were effectively off-limits to African Americans. By the end of the 1960s, there were at least 10,000 sundown towns across the U.S.– including large suburbs such as Glendale, California (population 60,000 at the time); Levittown, New York (80,000); and Warren, Michigan (180,000). Over half the incorporated communities in Illinois were sundown towns. The unofficial slogan of Anna, Illinois, which had violently expelled its African-American population in 1909, was [...] "Ain't No Niggers Allowed". Even in towns which did not exclude overnight stays by blacks, accommodations were often very limited. African Americans migrating to California to find work in the early 1940s often found themselves camping by the roadside overnight for lack of any hotel accommodation along the way. They were acutely aware of the <b>discriminatory</b> <b>treatment</b> that they received. Courtland Milloy's mother, who took him and his brother on road trips when they were children, recalled that [...] "after riding all day, I'd say to myself, 'Wouldn't it be nice if we could spend the night in one of those hotels?' or, 'Wouldn't it be great if we could stop for a real meal and a cup of coffee?'

40|$|Recently, {{data mining}} has been {{deemed to be}} an {{effective}} means for disclosing evidences and hidden causes of discrimination. If data mining succeeds in finding associations proving the fact that <b>discriminatory</b> <b>treatments</b> has strong relations with sensitive attributes, discrimination is obviously irrefutable. In this thesis, I propose a modified approach of the traditional data mining process to unveil and represent discrimination in a “rich semantic” form for semi-structured business data with multiple-valued treatments based on support from ontology. First, input data are preprocessed to be well-structured with semantic relations, which considerably support discrimination exploration later. The framework then seeks possibly discriminatory relations between the unequal treatments and protected-by-law attributes, e. g., race, religion, sex. These discriminatory relations will be represented in the form of association rules through the notion of matching pairs of itemsets with different sensitive attributes and equal non-sensitive ones that are subject to different treatments. By combining data mining and reasoning service over the ontology, the achieved rules are semantically enriched by object properties between classes (concepts). Thus, they are more valuable and interesting than the flat association rules. In order to address the drawback of local knowledge, the solution of “kNN as Situation Testing” is provided. Besides, a number of measures of discrimination are provided for the purpose of quantifying the level of discrimination to obtain a precise vision of how different sensitive attributes negatively affect the decision and even on each other. Experimental results confirm the potential and flexibility of the approach...|$|R

2500|$|An {{important}} distinction {{exists between the}} many uses of linguistic profiling {{and the potential for}} <b>discriminatory</b> <b>treatment.</b> The power to determine origin or racial identity based on speech can be utilized without overt discrimination, as argued in several court cases where voice was used in the prosecution of a suspect. The negative effects of linguistic profiling are seen in the practice of denying housing or employment based on stereotypes associated with dialect and/or accent. Further negative practices are associated with education and general treatment of individuals speaking stigmatized dialects. A more positive view of the practice is found in Baugh's description of expressions of ethnic pride.

40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} {{the validity of}} enthesitis indices in patients with peripheral spondyloarthritis (pSpA). Methods. The ABILITY- 2 study evaluated the efficacy of adalimumab (ADA) versus placebo (PBO) in patients with active pSpA over 12 weeks. Patients received open-label ADA for an additional 144 weeks. Twenty-nine enthesitis sites used in 3 enthesitis scoring systems [Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI), Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) Enthesitis Index, Maastricht Ankylosing Spondylitis Enthesitis Score (MASES) ] were assessed; <b>discriminatory</b> capacity and <b>treatment</b> response at Week 12 were calculated by standardized mean difference (SMD) and Guyatt's effect size (ES). Sites showing resolution or new-onset enthesitis from baseline to Week 12 were analyzed. Results. Overall, 165 patients (ADA, n = 84; PBO, n = 81) were randomized; 143 had = 1 enthesitis site at baseline. The LEI (SMD 0. 73, ES 1. 07) and SPARCC (SMD 0. 56, ES 0. 99) enthesitis indices showed higher <b>discriminatory</b> ability and <b>treatment</b> response than MASES (SMD - 0. 32, ES - 0. 81). At Week 12, among sites that were positive at baseline, significantly more (p < 0. 05) showed resolution among patients treated with ADA versus PBO in the Achilles tendon (60. 4 % and 36. 5 %, respectively), medial epicondyle (73. 2 %, 48. 7 %), lateral epicondyle (80. 6 %, 52. 8 %), and iliac crest (73. 5 %, 47. 2 %). Among negative sites at baseline, significantly less (p < 0. 05) new-onset enthesitis was observed with ADA versus PBO for Achilles tendon (3. 6 % and 10. 9 %, respectively), greater trochanter (3. 4 %, 14. 4 %), lateral epicondyle humerus (4. 7 %, 15. 1 %), medial femoral condyle (1. 6 %, 9. 2 %), and quadriceps insertion superior patella (1. 5 %, 7. 0 %). Conclusion.
