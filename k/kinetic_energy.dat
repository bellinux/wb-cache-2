5|$|In 1914, Franck {{teamed up}} with Hertz to perform an {{experiment}} to investigate fluorescence. They designed a vacuum tube for studying energetic electrons that flew through a thin vapour of mercury atoms. They discovered that when an electron collided with a mercury atom it could lose only a specific quantity (4.9electron volts) of its <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> before flying away. A faster electron does not decelerate completely after a collision, but loses precisely {{the same amount of}} its <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy.</b> Slower electrons just bounce off mercury atoms without losing any significant speed or <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy.</b>|$|E

5|$|Explosives {{would also}} have been superfluous. At its closing {{velocity}} of 10.2km/s, the impactor's <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> was equivalent to 4.8 metric tons of TNT, considerably more than its actual mass of only 370kg.|$|E
40|$|Hadrons with <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies</b> {{higher than}} the pion {{production}} threshold lose their <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies</b> monotonically in traversing atomic nuclei, due to the strong interactions in nuclear matter. This phenomenon is a crude analogy to the energy loss of charged particles in their passage through materials. Experimental evidence is presented...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{responses}} of the closure relations, specific turbulent Helmholtz free energy and turbulent viscosity are postulated followed by experimental calibrations. The established closure model is applied to analyses of a gravity-driven stationary avalanche with incompressible grains down an incline. While the mean velocity and volume fraction increase from their minimum values on the plane toward maximum values on the free surface exponentially, two-fold turbulent <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies</b> and dissipations evolve in a reverse manner. Most two-fold turbulent <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies</b> and dissipations are confined within the thin turbulent boundary layer immediately above the plane, with nearly vanishing two-fold turbulent <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies</b> and finite two-fold turbulent dissipations in the passive layer. The two layers {{are similar to those}} of Newtonian fluids in turbulent boundary layer flows, and are preferable recognized by the distributions of turbulent <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies</b> and dissipations...|$|R

5|$|Ocean tides are {{converted}} to heat by frictional {{losses in the}} oceans and their interaction with the solid bottom and with the top ice crust. In late 2008, it was suggested Jupiter may keep Europa's oceans warm by generating large planetary tidal waves on Europa because of its small but non-zero obliquity. This generates so-called Rossby waves that travel quite slowly, at just a few kilometers per day, but can generate significant <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy.</b> For the current axial tilt estimate of 0.1 degree, the resonance from Rossby waves would contain 7.3 J of <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy,</b> which is two thousand times larger {{than that of the}} flow excited by the dominant tidal forces. Dissipation of this energy could be the principal heat source of Europa's ocean.|$|E
50|$|The Hamiltonian {{is the sum}} of the <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies</b> of all the particles, {{plus the}} {{potential}} energy of the particles associated with the system. For different situations or number of particles, the Hamiltonian is different since it includes the sum of <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies</b> of the particles, and the potential energy function corresponding to the situation.|$|R
40|$|<b>Kinetic</b> <b>energies</b> and charge-state {{fractions}} of specularly reflected fragments {{have been studied}} at glancing-angle incidence of (0. 8 - 2. 5) -MeV HeH+ ions on a clean (001) surface of SnTe. It is shown that the <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies</b> of fragments agree well with those calculated from Coulomb repulsion of He+ and H+ fragments, {{while most of the}} outgoing fragments are bare nuclei. The final <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies</b> and charge-state {{fractions of}} fragments are explained by a computer simulation: HeH+ dissociates into fragments where at least one electron is retained in the He-H system and there follows electron loss from the fragments after most of the initial potential energy has been transferred to the <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies</b> of fragments. The cross section for dissociation of HeH+ ions in collisions with electrons at the surface is estimated to be of the order of 10 ^(- 16) cm^ 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of the oxygen adsorption on Pt(111) have been studied by tight-binding molecu-lar dynamics simulations based on an ab initio potential energy surface. The calculations lead to a novel unified picture of the molecular adsorption process of O 2 /Pt(111). Oxygen adsorption always proceeds through molecular chemisorption states. The trapping dynamics are domi-nated by the steering effect at low <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies</b> whereas a dynamical precursor is involved at higher <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies.</b> Direct dissociative adsorption {{turns out to be}} very unlikely even for <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies</b> much larger than the dissociation barrier because of the particular topology of the potential energy surface. These results are also relevant for related adsorption systems. ...|$|R
5|$|Several {{observers}} (including Plait and Tyson) {{said that}} in the scene in which Kowalski unclips his tether and floats away to his death to save Stone from being pulled away from the ISS, Stone would simply need to tug the tether gently to pull Kowalski toward her. According to the film's science adviser Kevin Grazier and NASA engineer Robert Frost, however, the pair are still decelerating with Stone's leg caught in the parachute cords from the Soyuz. The cords stretch as they absorb her <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy.</b> Kowalski thinks that the cords are not strong enough to absorb his <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> as well as hers, and that he must release the tether to give Stone a chance of stopping before the cords fail and doom both of them.|$|E
5|$|The {{acceleration}} of the plasma into the co-rotation leads to the transfer of energy from the Jovian rotation to the <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> of the plasma.

5|$|The {{interfaces}} between {{regions with}} sharp differences in rotation {{are believed to}} be efficient sites for the dynamo processes that generate the stellar magnetic field. There is also a complex interaction between a star's rotation distribution and its magnetic field, with the conversion of magnetic energy into <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> modifying the velocity distribution.|$|E
50|$|To {{increase}} the mass resolution in time-of-flight mass spectrometry, a reflectron is often employed. Traditional, single-stage or linear reflectrons {{suffered from a}} lack of sensitivity and resolving power when ion velocities (and thus <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies</b> were not equal. In MALDI mass spectrometry, metastable ions generated spontaneously after ionization (post-source decay) exhibit a wide spectrum of <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies.</b> This is also known to occur during collision-induced dissociation. In 1993, Cotter's research group discovered that, using a non-linear electric field, the spread of ion <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies</b> could be compensated, increasing the resolution of time-of-flight mass spectrometers and forming the basis for many modern TOF/TOF mass spectrometers.|$|R
25|$|The {{energy content}} {{of an object}} at rest with mass m equals mc2. Conservation of energy implies that, in any reaction, a {{decrease}} of {{the sum of the}} masses of particles must be accompanied by an increase in <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies</b> of the particles after the reaction. Similarly, the mass of an object can be increased by taking in <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies.</b>|$|R

5|$|As the {{mountains}} are eroded, {{more and more}} sand is created. At high wind speeds, sand grains are picked up off the surface and blown along, {{a process known as}} saltation. The whirling airborne grains act as a sand blasting mechanism which grinds away solid objects in its path as the <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> of the wind is transferred to the ground. The sand eventually ends up deposited in level areas known as sand-fields or sand-seas, or piled up in dunes.|$|E

Production of the AMX-30 also extended to a number of variants, including the AMX-30D armored recovery vehicle, the AMX-30R anti-aircraft gun system, a bridge-layer, the Pluton tactical nuclear missile launcher and a surface-to-air missile launcher.|$|E

50|$|Even in a {{relatively}} simple system, such as the neon atom, intense x-rays induce a plethora of ionisation processes (see Fig. 2). As the <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies</b> of the electrons ejected in different processes largely overlap, {{it is impossible to}} identify these processes using simple photoelectron spectrometry.

The principles of the variations of the nuclear charge distributions due to varying <b>kinetic</b> <b>energies</b> are discussed. (20 refs) ...|$|R

This implied that the gamma-ray and <b>kinetic</b> <b>energy</b> of the burst's ejecta were comparable, effectively ruling out those GRB models which are relatively inefficient at producing gamma rays.|$|E
