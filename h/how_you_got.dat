500|$|The coast offered Percy Shelley and Edward Williams {{the chance}} to enjoy their [...] "perfect plaything for the summer", a new sailing boat. The boat had been {{designed}} by Daniel Roberts and Edward Trelawny, an admirer of Byron's who had joined the party in January 1822. On 1 July 1822, Percy Shelley, Edward Ellerker Williams, and Captain Daniel Roberts sailed south down the coast to Livorno. There Percy Shelley discussed with Byron and Leigh Hunt the launch of a radical magazine called The Liberal. On 8 July, he and Edward Williams {{set out on the}} return journey to Lerici with their eighteen-year-old boatboy, Charles Vivian. They never reached their destination. A letter arrived at Villa Magni from Hunt to Percy Shelley, dated 8 July, saying, [...] "pray write to tell us <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> home, for they say you had bad weather after you sailed monday & we are anxious". [...] "The paper fell from me," [...] Mary told a friend later. [...] "I trembled all over." [...] She and Jane Williams rushed desperately to Livorno and then to Pisa in the fading hope that their husbands were still alive. Ten days after the storm, three bodies washed up on the coast near Viareggio, midway between Livorno and Lerici. Trelawny, Byron, and Hunt cremated Percy Shelley’s corpse on the beach at Viareggio.|$|E

He defines intuition as “getting a solution and not knowing <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> there” and “an insight into something that's a result from your experience with it.” In other words, developed through expertise, intuition can be rephrased as an “educated inference." ...|$|E

There's a thing called heterosexual privilege that the heterosexual community doesn't know about. It's the ability to move freely in the world in a way that assumes that heterosexuality is natural. You don't have people asking you questions about <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> to be that way. You don't have to watch your back when you hold your lover's hand in public." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1971, the Temptations {{finally found}} a {{permanent}} replacement for the first tenor position in twenty-year-old Baltimore native Damon Harris. Otis Williams, Edwards, Franklin, Street, and Harris continued recording and performing, and Norman Whitfield continued producing hits for them. There were Top 40 hits such as [...] "Superstar (Remember <b>How</b> <b>You</b> <b>Got</b> Where You Are)" [...] (1971), {{a message from the}} Temptations to David Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks, and [...] "Take a Look Around" [...] (1972). During this period, the group toured with Quiet Elegance as their back-up singers. Quiet Elegance featured Lois Reeves, the sister of Martha Reeves, alongside Frankie Gearing and Millie Vaney-Scott.|$|E

[...] But the members now agreed to an arrangement whereby {{each member of the}} LLC would receive an undisclosed sum prior to the transfer of their ownership rights to the Burning Man Project. Marian Goodell, board member and head of communication, addressed concerns about the lack of transparency with this statement: [...] "When you’re {{in the middle of a}} storm, if you’re going to explain all of <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>got</b> there, and how you’re going to get out, it often sets more panic among the survivors than if you just sail the boat out of the darkness." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{intended}} {{follow-up to}} [...] "Just My Imagination" [...] was [...] "Smiling Faces Sometimes", on which Kendricks sang lead. When Kendricks left, they released, instead, [...] "I'm The Exception to the Rule", {{a song in}} the same vein (featuring Kendricks, Otis Williams and Edwards on lead) which follows [...] "Just My Imagination" [...] on the album. Unable to promote the song because they did not have anyone to do his parts in concert, the song failed miserably so the company pushed the [...] "B-side" [...] – the group's re-recording of [...] "It's Summer", initially the B-side of [...] "Ball of Confusion", at the last-minute, and Norman Whitfield had The Undisputed Truth record [...] "Smiling Faces Sometimes", for whom it was a major hit. The Temptations and Norman Whitfield returned to psychedelic soul for their next album, Solid Rock, whose second single, [...] "Superstar (Remember <b>How</b> <b>You</b> <b>Got</b> Where You Are)", was written by Whitfield and Barrett Strong as an alleged criticism of both Kendricks and David Ruffin.|$|E

At his Selective Service interview, he told the local board, [...] "in this stage of my life here in the United States whose foot has been in my ass?" [...] He was {{thereafter}} classed as 4-F. In 1943, Gillespie joined the Earl Hines band. Composer Gunther Schuller said:" ... In 1943 I heard the great Earl Hines band which had Bird in it {{and all those other}} great musicians. They were playing all the flatted fifth chords and all the modern harmonies and substitutions and Gillespie runs in the trumpet section work. Two years later I read that that was 'bop' and the beginning of modern jazz ... but the band never made recordings." [...] Gillespie said of the Hines band, [...] "eople talk about the Hines band being 'the incubator of bop' and the leading exponents of that music ended up in the Hines band.

2500|$|Kendricks' solo {{career began}} slowly; he endured {{two years of}} singles that missed the Top 40, while The Temptations {{continued}} with their string of Norman Whitfield-helmed hits (one of which, [...] "Superstar (Remember <b>How</b> <b>You</b> <b>Got</b> Where You Are)", was written as a jab towards Kendricks and Ruffin). Despite enjoying only a modicum of commercial success and radio airplay, Kendricks's 1972 album People... Hold On (recorded with his touring group, The Young Senators, composed of Jimi Dougans, Frank Hooker, LeRoy Fleming, Wornell Jones, David Lecraft, James Drummer Johnson and John Engram) was a cornerstone of DJ playlists in downtown New York's nascent disco scene. The expansive, eight-minute take on [...] "Girl, You Need A Change Of Mind", which peaked at number thirteen on the soul chart, was a particular favorite at David Mancuso's Loft. The single was later remade by R singer D'Angelo for the Get on the Bus soundtrack. As the dance craze seeped through into other cities, Kendricks scored a #1 pop hit in 1973 with the Frank Wilson-produced [...] "Keep on Truckin'", becoming {{the only member of}} the Temptations to register a #1 hit in the U.S. as a solo artist. As well as reaching #18 in the UK, it sold over 1 million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. Further hits included 1974's [...] "Boogie Down" [...] (US #2, UK #39) and another million selling release, [...] "Son of Sagittarius" [...] (US #28) from the same year, 1975's [...] "Shoeshine Boy" [...] (US #18), and 1976's [...] "He's a Friend" [...] (US #36). Another notable song is [...] "Intimate Friends" [...] (1977), which was sampled for the Alicia Keys song [...] "Unbreakable", [...] "A Penny for My Thoughts" [...] by Common, Sparkle's [...] "Time to Move on" [...] on her self-titled first studio album, and for Sweet Sable's [...] "Old Time's Sake" [...] from the soundtrack for the 1994 2pac film, Above the Rim. Erykah Badu also sampled [...] "Intimate Friends" [...] for her song [...] "Fall in Love (Your Funeral)", as well as his song [...] "My People... Hold on" [...] for her song [...] "My People" [...] on her album New Amerykah Part One (4th World War).|$|E
