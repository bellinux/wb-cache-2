2500|$|The sag {{phase in}} the Santos Basin was characterised by thermal {{subsidence}} and generated restricted depocentres with relatively uniform water depths, ranging from [...] The Late Aptian climate was arid with high evaporation rates which triggered hypersaline conditions in these marginal sag basins. This resulted in the accumulation of thick layers of evaporites along the Brazilian and southwestern African continental margins, a process continuing towards the north later in the Cretaceous. The deposition of the lowermost [...] of salt in the Aptian would have taken approximately 20,000 to 30,000 years. With the continental break-up of the Santos and Campos Basins from the opposite Namibia and <b>Kwanza</b> Basins, oceanic circulation returned during the post-rift stage. The drift phase since the Late Cretaceous produced a thick sequence of clastic and carbonate deposits. Differential thermal regimes and sediment loading of these units produced halokinesis; salt movement in the subsurface. The resulting salt diapirs, listric and thrust faults and various salt-related structures produced several stratigraphic and combined stratigraphic-structural traps for hydrocarbon accumulation in the Brazilian and southwest African offshore.|$|E
