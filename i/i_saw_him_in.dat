5|$|I fell in {{love with}} him as a ten-year-old boy. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> a play in New York... a very well-staged melodrama which was an {{enormous}} hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies—little things. And I could never forget that performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for him. You play next to him and you just feel the thing that you do with a big actor—this dynamo going on.|$|E
25|$|After the fight, Shamrock {{admitted}} that he underestimated Gracie: “I didn’t know who Royce Gracie was...when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> his gi, I thought he was some karate guy (with no ground skills).” Also, he put the blame of his loss {{in the fact that}} he wasn't allowed to wear his wrestling shoes during the fights, while Gracie himself had been allowed to wear his gi.|$|E
500|$|Though as a {{minor league}} prospect, analysts derided his {{defensive}} potential, with one calling him [...] "terrible", he progressively improved. Late in 2013, Sandberg commented on his defensive improvement: [...] "I see tremendous progress on his footwork out there, his reads on balls, his quickness, his reacting to the hops and getting the hop he wants. It looks like he's really worked on his glove play, just using the glove along with his strong accurate arm. It's a very true ball that he throws over there. It's got a lot on it. I've {{seen a lot of}} improving developments since <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> mid-February. He's come a long way." ...|$|E
60|$|ACRES Breach of friendship! ay, ay; but I have no {{acquaintance}} with this man. <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> my life.|$|R
60|$|As I {{was being}} ferried across <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> lolling <b>in</b> the stern-sheets {{of a little}} boat, the sun {{crowning}} his straw hat with glory.|$|R
60|$|Thus adjured, I {{crossed the}} road, Oro {{following}} me. Looking round, to my horror <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> right <b>in</b> {{the path of}} a motor-bus which seemed to go over him.|$|R
500|$|Miles Morales {{was created}} by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli. Bendis' {{thoughts}} about the character, {{and the way he}} looked in his first appearance, were heavily influenced by African American actor Donald Glover's appearance in Spider-Man pajamas in [...] "Anthropology 101", the second season premiere of the television comedy series Community. This was a reference to an unsuccessful online campaign that attempted to secure Glover an audition for the lead role in the 2012 film The Amazing Spider-Man. Bendis said of Glover, [...] "He looked fantastic! <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the costume and thought, 'I would like to read that book.' So I was glad I was writing that book." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his 1900 book A Ball Player's Career, Anson said Gore {{was a good}} player. Also, [...] "Women {{and wine}} brought about his downfall, however, {{and the last time}} that <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> New York he was broken down, both in heart and pocket, and willing to work at {{anything}} that would yield him the bare necessities of life." ...|$|E
2500|$|As in Hebrew, {{the regular}} pronoun {{referring}} to the antecedent is repeated in the relative clause - literally, [...] "the boy whom <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> class..." [...] (the -hu in ra'aituhu and the -ō in shuftō). The rules of suppression in Arabic are identical to those of Hebrew: obligatory suppression in {{the case that the}} pronoun is the subject of the relative clause, obligatory retention in the case that the pronoun is the object of a preposition, and at the discretion of the speaker if the pronoun is the direct object. The only difference from Hebrew is that, {{in the case of the}} direct object, it is preferable to retain the pronoun rather than suppress it.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would not}} wonder that I defend him," [...] said the girl, [...] "could {{you have seen}} <b>him</b> as <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> battling <b>in</b> my behalf with that huge hairy brute.|$|R
60|$|Const. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> run <b>in</b> at {{my cousin}} Isabella's chamber door, which was wide open; I believe she's returned: We'll fetch a {{light from the}} gallery, and give her joy.|$|R
6000|$|When <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> tangled <b>in</b> her toils, [...] A shame, said I, if {{she adds}} just him [...] 10 [...] To her nine-and-ninety other spoils, [...] The {{hundredth}} for a whim! ...|$|R
2500|$|After {{his attempt}} to get {{permission}} to settle in Frankfurt failed, Stoskopff went to Paris. He stayed there from about 1622 until 1639, which can be reconstructed from indirect reports and property inventories of Parisians. His first works in larger format were also created here, such as [...] "Summer" [...] or [...] "Winter" [...] (now both in Strasbourg). A contemporary statement from Sandrart proves his residence in Paris: [...] "Von dannen [...] verreiste er in Frankreich und hinterließ viele gute Werke; von Pariß zoge er nach Italien (allwo ich ihn zu Venedig Anno 1629 gesehen), hernach wieder zurück nach Pariß und so fürters nach Straßburg [...] ("From there , he travelled to France and left many good works; from Paris, he moved to Italy (where <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> Venice in 1629), afterwards again back to Paris and further to Strasbourg [...] ").|$|E
60|$|The man moved away, and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> {{a corner}} talking to Louis. Lamartine served the grouse, and {{leaned across the}} table to me.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said my friend, [...] "sure--Billy is {{ranching}} out in Montana. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> Chicago last spring,--weighed {{about two}} hundred pounds,--you wouldn't know him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, ay; you are jealous. The old story. Don't tell me. Now do you bide here. I'll send Fitzpiers to you. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> smoking <b>in</b> {{front of}} his house but a minute by-gone." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{she spoke}} {{she opened the}} door, softly. The room was still now, still as death, and the Alcalde went forward on tiptoe. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> peering <b>in,</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> backing away again like a man in mortal fear.|$|R
6000|$|... "I said <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> the house," [...] said Rose with a shudder; [...] "but {{they said}} if ever I told {{they would give}} me to the lions in the Zoological Gardens." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Davy," [...] said he, [...] "Clark has changed. He is not {{the same}} man he was when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> Williamsburg {{demanding}} supplies for his campaign." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Absolutely impossible.... <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> Paris {{after the}} Algerian {{campaign}} ... thinner, that is all.... Reist and the English journalist were simply left ... planté là. Hernoff planned everything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know him, sir," [...] Beddoes interrupted. [...] "The Tavern Knight {{they called}} him in the {{malignant}} army--a rakehelly, dissolute brawler. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> Worcester when he was taken after the fight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He was there, Señor," [...] she answered, {{eager to}} set herself right with this most {{agreeable}} and discriminating foreigner, [...] "for <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> go <b>in</b> a moment before, {{and he did}} not come out again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My Lord Risingham?" [...] {{returned}} Dick. [...] "I would I {{had good}} news to give you, madam, but I have none. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> once <b>in</b> the battle, and once only. Let us hope the best." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He wasn't here {{a minute}} in all," [...] said she; [...] "and {{he said nothing}} about paying for what he took--and, when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> going <b>in</b> there, <b>I</b> thought it best to let him have his own way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘As I shall {{answer to}} God, I knew not that my Lord was slain, till <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> his last agony, {{and was very}} sorry, yea, prayed in my heart for the same.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{difficulty}} about that. He is {{even now}} in the colony. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> a gambling-house half-an-hour since. My fear is that, now the murder's out, he'll bolt before we can secure him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What, old Round? <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> {{the hall}} to-day yawning {{as though he}} would burst." [...] And then Mr. Furnival strolled off {{to look for the}} {{attorney}} among the various purlieus frequented by the learned strangers.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> {{this evening}} <b>in</b> Piccadilly, and I almost ran into his arms. It was quite awkward.|$|R
6000|$|... "He's always hearty enough," [...] replied Jack, [...] "but I {{must confess}} <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> such high spirits as {{he seems to}} be in just now. It must be the effect of meeting with new faces, I suppose." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "As I've said before, as {{a guitar}} player my main {{inspiration}} was Rory Gallagher. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> play <b>in</b> Taste {{many times and}} he really inspired me, not just musically {{but also in the}} amount of energy and feel he put out".|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may well}} say so," [...] {{answered}} the cattle-drover. [...] "Why, that’s the famous Doctor Samuel Johnson, who, they say, {{is the greatest}} and learnedest man in England. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> London Streets, walking with one Mr. Boswell." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{would have}} seized him, but he eluded me and quitted {{the house with}} precipitation. In a few moments <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> his boat, which shot across the waters with an arrowy {{swiftness}} and was soon lost amidst the waves.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was demobbed {{just about}} a year ago. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> Paris about a year before that. The old egg got a bit of {{shrapnel}} in his foot or something, didn't he? Anyhow, I remember he was sent home." ...|$|E
60|$|Alonzo. Their king {{himself did}} their last sally guide; <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him,</b> glistering <b>in</b> his armour, ride To break a lance {{in honour of}} his bride: But other {{thoughts}} now fill his anxious breast; Care of his crown his love has dispossest.|$|R
6000|$|... "That I should nurse him--should cross {{with him}} to London?" [...] she repeated. [...] "Why, I do not know this man Phillips. <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> <b>in</b> my life! <b>I</b> have not even been in Ward Fourteen since he was brought there." ...|$|R
60|$|Hendry would {{probably}} have recovered from the fever had not this terrible dread darkened his intellect {{when he was still}} prostrate.
