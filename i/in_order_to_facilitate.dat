Since David Livingstone had returned to the area in 1858 in an attempt to foster trade routes, British interest in Mozambique had risen, alarming the Portuguese government. During the 19th century, much of Eastern Africa was still being brought under British control, and <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>facilitate</b> this, Britain required several concessions from the Portuguese colony.|$|E

The foundational members included 31 women, most of whom worked as educators rather than as scholars at research institutions.

5|$|Prior to the 16th century, civic {{administration}} {{for the town}} of Reading was situated in the Yield Hall, a guild hall situated by the River Kennet near today's Yield Hall Lane. After a brief stay in what later became Greyfriars Church, the town council created a new town hall by inserting an upper floor into the refectory of the Hospitium of St John, the former hospitium of Reading Abbey. For some 400 years up to the 1970s, this was to remain the site of Reading's civic administration through the successive rebuilds that eventually created today's Town Hall. In 1976, Reading Borough Council moved to the new Civic Centre. In 2014, they moved again to civic offices in a refurbished existing office building on Bridge Street, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>facilitate</b> the demolition and redevelopment of the previous site.|$|E

Once the leading wave of Japanese was safely ashore, the massed Japanese artillery switched their fire to the defensive positions at Kranji. Telegraph and telephone communications were destroyed in the bombardment and communications between the front line and command HQ were broken.

40|$|Abstract: In an {{insulation}} {{arrangement with}} a high voltage electrode surrounded by several grounded objects, i. e. a multi-gap system, the breakdown may take place over longer gap spacing instead of the shortest one. This is especially the case when several long gaps are stressed simultaneously by switching impulse voltage. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>facilitating</b> the insulation design of UHVDC systems, {{the authors of this}} report have conducted laboratory studies on the multi-gap system, representing the situations inside the converter valve hall. The electrodes used there are often of a large curvature. They are located at the places surrounded by grounded objects such as the walls of the valve hall. Many interesting results have been obtained. In this paper some of the intriguing observations on the breakdown trajectories are presented...|$|R

Samuel Wanjiru's half marathon world record was next to fall as Zersenay crossed the line at 58:23 minutes, a clear ten seconds ahead of the previous mark.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{accounts}} of Saruman's earlier history appear in Appendix B to The Lord of the Rings, {{first published in}} The Return of the King, and in the posthumously published The Silmarillion (1977) and Unfinished Tales (1980). All were written in the mid-1950s. Saruman, like Gandalf and Radagast the Brown, {{is one of five}} 'wizards', known as the Istari, who begin to arrive in Middle-earth circa two thousand years before the beginning of The Lord of the Rings. They are Maiar, envoys of the godlike Valar sent to challenge Sauron by inspiring the people of Middle-earth rather than by direct conflict. Tolkien regarded them as being somewhat like incarnate angels. Saruman initially travels in the east; he is later appointed head of the White Council and eventually settles at Gondor's outpost of Isengard. Fifty years before The Lord of the Rings, after his studies reveal that the One Ring might be found in the river Anduin near Sauron's stronghold at Dol Guldur, he helps the White Council drive out Sauron <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>facilitate</b> his search.|$|E
5|$|The 38th (Welsh) Division (initially the 43rd Division, {{later the}} 38th (Welsh) Infantry Division {{and then the}} 38th Infantry (Reserve) Division) of the British Army was active during both the First and Second World Wars. In 1914, the {{division}} was raised as the 43rd Division of Herbert Kitchener's New Army, and was originally intended to form part of a 50,000-strong Welsh Army Corps that had been championed by David Lloyd George; the assignment of Welsh recruits to other formations meant that this concept was never realised. The 43rd was renamed the 38th (Welsh) Division on 29 April 1915, and shipped to France later that year. It arrived in France with a poor reputation, seen as a political formation that was ill-trained and poorly led. The division's baptism by fire came {{in the first days}} of the Battle of the Somme, where it captured the strongly held Mametz Wood at the loss of nearly 4,000 men. This strongly held German position needed to be secured <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>facilitate</b> the next phase of the Somme offensive; the Battle of Bazentin Ridge.

5|$|The {{length of}} the {{gestation}} period tends to vary greatly, though 110 days is {{the average length of}} time. In the final stages of pregnancy, dominant females provide their developing offspring with higher androgen levels than lower-ranking mothers do. The higher androgen levels the result of high concentrations of ovarian androstenedione are thought to be responsible for the extreme masculinization of female behavior and morphology. This has the effect of rendering the cubs of dominant females more aggressive and sexually active than those of lower ranking hyenas; high ranking male cubs will attempt to mount females earlier than lower ranking males. The average litter consists of two cubs, with three occasionally being reported. Males take no part in the raising of young. Giving birth is difficult for female hyenas, as the females give birth through their narrow clitoris, and spotted hyena cubs are the largest carnivoran young relative to their mothers' weight. During parturition, the clitoris ruptures <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>facilitate</b> the passage of the young, and may take weeks to heal.|$|E
5|$|The {{unmanned}} Progress cargo {{vehicles were}} only used to resupply the station, carrying {{a variety of}} cargoes including water, fuel, food and experimental equipment. The spacecraft were not equipped with reentry shielding and so, unlike their Soyuz counterparts, were incapable of surviving reentry. As a result, when its cargo had been unloaded, each Progress was refilled with rubbish, spent equipment and other waste which was destroyed, along with the Progress itself, on reentry. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>facilitate</b> cargo return, ten Progress flights carried Raduga capsules, which could return around 150kg of experimental results to Earth automatically. Mir was visited by three separate models of Progress; the original 7K-TG variant equipped with Igla (18 flights), the Progress-M model equipped with Kurs (43 flights), and the modified Progress-M1 version (3 flights), which together flew a total of 64 resupply missions. Whilst the Progress spacecraft usually docked automatically without incident, the station was equipped with a remote manual docking system, TORU, in case problems were encountered during the automatic approaches. With TORU cosmonauts could guide the spacecraft safely in to dock (with {{the exception of the}} catastrophic docking of Progress M-34, when the long-range use of the system resulted in the spacecraft's striking the station, damaging Spektr and causing decompression).|$|E
