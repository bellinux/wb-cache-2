25|$|Solomon {{believes}} {{that his son}} is alive, just perhaps not in the U.S. In spring of 2011, after the visit to the doctor {{that was the last}} independent record of Sky's presence outside of Biryukova's household, he recalled that her estranged father came from Ukraine to visit her. He wondered to the Weekly if the older man could have taken the boy back to that country with him at the time. But he admitted that by 2013 he did not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> could have happened.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the podium}} ceremony, {{in which two}} Brazilian drivers participated {{for the first time}} since the 1991 Belgian Grand Prix, the top three {{finishers}} appeared in the obligatory press conference. Hamilton said that the decision to not make a pit stop during the safety car period was the team's decision: [...] "We had two very comfortable, two very decent stints and the team opted for me to stay out. I guess they thought I could pull out a gap but it was a 23 second gap I needed and I only had seven laps or something, so I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> worked out." [...] Hamilton added that he felt that things looked good for the rest of the season, stating that [...] "if we [...] can continue with this momentum we have got we are looking very good".|$|E
500|$|Later {{alternative}} bands such as Nirvana, Pavement, Radiohead, Coldplay, Pearl Jam, Live, and Local H {{have drawn}} inspiration from R.E.M.'s music. [...] "When I was 15 {{years old in}} Richmond, Virginia, they were {{a very important part}} of my life," [...] Pavement's Bob Nastanovich said, [...] "as they were for all the members of our band." [...] Pavement devoted the song [...] "Unseen Power of the Picket Fence" [...] from the No Alternative compilation (1993) to discussing Chronic Town and Reckoning. Local H, according to the band's Twitter account, created their name by combining two R.E.M. songs: [...] "Oddfellows Local 151" [...] and [...] "Swan Swan H". Kurt Cobain of Nirvana was a vocal fan of R.E.M., and had plans to collaborate on a musical project with Stipe before his death in April 1994. Cobain told Rolling Stone in an interview earlier that year, [...] "I don’t <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> band does what they do. God, they’re the greatest. They’ve dealt with their success like saints, and they keep delivering great music." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mir faced Mark Hunt on March 20, 2016, at UFC Fight Night 85. He {{lost the}} fight via KO {{in the first}} round. On April 7, 2016, Mir was {{notified}} by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) that the sample he submitted the day he fought Hunt in Brisbane, Australia, tested positive for oral turinabol metabolites. In a statement, Mir responded, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> is possible as I do not take any performance enhancing drugs (PEDs)." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Not {{to protect}} himself, but to protect her," [...] Peck said, also {{noting that the}} {{decision}} to publish it was made not long after the death of Alice Lee, who had long handled Harper Lee's affairs. [...] "You just don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> decision was made... If he had to, he would have flown down to talk to her. I have no doubt." [...] Later in the article, which was posted in The Wall Street Journal, he said, “To me, it was an unedited draft. Do you want to put that early version out there {{or do you want to}} put it in the University of Alabama archives for scholars to look at?” ...|$|E
2500|$|Mary McNamara for the Los Angeles Times {{commented on}} {{parallels}} drawn between the Visitors and President Barack Obama, insofar as: [...] "The instant adoration, the attractiveness and rhetorical skills of Anna, {{the idea that}} the Visitors will woo us with universal healthcare and then destroy us all seem a right-wingish take on the president's ascendancy." [...] She continued: [...] "Perhaps that is the creators' intent, but most successful science fiction contains an element of, if not outright humor, then the absurd. That the human race will be enslaved not through brainwashing or firepower but adequate healthcare is pretty hilarious in a dark and almost possible way. And Anna and her crew seem to embody more of a Wall Street deregulated/Bernie Madoff mentality—big returns for minimum investment. And we all <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> turns out." [...] Linda Stasi for The New York Post conversely compared the Visitors to extremist Muslims. Though in the original series the aliens were a metaphor for Nazis, Stasi commented: [...] "TV shows no longer have to rely on Nazis, because now we have the hated extremist Muslims to make all bad-guy metaphors with", adding on the Visitors' appearance: [...] "Once you peel back the outer, good-looking shell, you've got your standard outer-space Nazi/Taliban lizard person lurking beneath." ...|$|E
60|$|His {{own hand}} shook, as he {{accepted}} a rose {{or two from}} hers and thanked her. They were now by an avenue of trees. Whether they turned into it on his movement or on hers matters little. He never <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> was.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then why didn't {{you say so}} to me, you wretched boy?" [...] cried Kate. [...] "You {{ought to}} have <b>known</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> would have comforted me. If I could only think he has surely written, my heart would bound, no matter what his letter told; but to be utterly dropped, that I cannot bear." ...|$|R

5000|$|It {{has been}} stated that Tammukan was a {{specific}} place, a lost city even. It is not <b>known</b> <b>how</b> <b>that</b> idea came about.

60|$|Angela Vivian {{directed}} {{her eyes to}} her neighbors, and let them rest a while on the young girl's little fidgeting figure and her fresh, coquettish face. For some moments she said nothing, and to Longueville, turning over several things in his mind, and watching her, it seemed that her glance was one of disfavor. He divined, he scarcely <b>knew</b> <b>how,</b> <b>that</b> her esteem for her pretty companion was small.|$|R
