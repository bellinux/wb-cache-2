5|$|The use of {{incendiary}} devices had {{decreased by}} the 14th century, {{perhaps due to}} the <b>economic</b> <b>realities</b> of war where it became increasingly important that captured castles and towns were undamaged. Moreover, fewer wooden engines and structures were employed in the battlefield after the late 13th century, {{perhaps because of the}} prior success of the incendiary weapons at destroying them.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} <b>economic</b> <b>realities</b> of the {{conversion}} to sound, were the artistic considerations. Early sound films were often noted {{for being too}} verbose. In 1930, Carl Laemmle criticized the wall-to-wall banter of sound pictures, and director Ernst Lubitsch wondered what the camera was intended for if characters were going to narrate all the onscreen action. The film industry also withstood competition from the home radio, and often characters in films {{went to great lengths}} to belittle the medium. The film industry was not above using the new medium to broadcast commercials for its projects however, and occasionally turned radio stars into short feature performers to take advantage of their built-in following.|$|E

5|$|Many pre-Code films {{dealt with}} the <b>economic</b> <b>realities</b> of a country {{struggling}} to find its next meal. In Blonde Venus (1932), Marlene Dietrich's character resorts to prostitution to feed her child, and Claudette Colbert's character in It Happened One Night (1934) gets her comeuppance for throwing a tray of food onto the floor by later finding herself without food or financial resources. Joan Blondell's character in Big City Blues (1932) reflects that as a chorus girl she regularly received diamonds and pearls as gifts, but now must content herself with a corned beef sandwich. In Union Depot (1932), Douglas Fairbanks Jr. puts a luscious meal as {{the first order of}} business on his itinerary after coming into money.|$|E
5|$|Sampson's term {{in office}} was a tumultuous one. The 1928 {{legislature}} was dominated by Democrats and was not particularly responsive to Sampson's proposals. After the session, Sampson was indicted for accepting gifts from textbook companies, but the charges were later dropped. In 1929, Sampson removed Democratic political boss Ben Johnson from his post as highway commissioner. When legislators reconvened in 1930, they retaliated by stripping Sampson {{of many of his}} appointment powers and reinstalling Johnson to his post. Later in the session, Sampson proposed to allow Samuel Insull to dam the Cumberland Falls to generate hydroelectric power. The General Assembly instead voted to accept an offer from T. Coleman du Pont to purchase the falls and turn them into a state park. The Assembly voted to further restrict Sampson's powers in 1930. The end of Sampson's term was complicated by the <b>economic</b> <b>realities</b> of the Great Depression. He called out the Kentucky National Guard to quell a violent mine strike in Harlan County known as the Battle of Evarts. Following his term, Sampson returned to Barbourville and was re-elected as a circuit court judge. He died May 25, 1967 and was buried in Barbourville Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|The {{slave trade}} {{was engaged in}} by European state and non-state actors such as Great Britain, the Netherlands, Portugal and private companies, as well as various African states and non-state actors. With rising anti-slavery {{sentiment}} at home and changing <b>economic</b> <b>realities,</b> Great Britain outlawed the international slave trade in 1807. Following the Napoleonic Wars, Great Britain established the West Africa Squadron {{in an attempt to}} halt the international traffic in slaves. It stopped ships of other nations that were leaving the African coast with slaves; the seized slaves were taken to Freetown, a colony in West Africa originally established for the resettlement of freed slaves from Britain. Britain intervened in the Lagos Kingship power struggle by bombarding Lagos in 1851, deposing the slave trade friendly Oba Kosoko, helping to install the amenable Oba Akitoye, and signing the Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos on 1 January 1852. Britain annexed Lagos as a Crown Colony in August 1861 with the Lagos Treaty of Cession. British missionaries expanded their operations and travelled further inland. In 1864, Samuel Ajayi Crowther became the first African bishop of the Anglican Church.|$|E

25|$|This econometric {{find was}} the result of Wassily W. Leontief's attempt to test the Heckscher–Ohlin theory empirically. In 1953, Leontief found that the United States—the most capital-abundant country in the world—exported {{commodities}} that were more labor-intensive than capital-intensive, in contradiction with Heckscher–Ohlin theory ("H–O theory"). Leontief used this result to infer that the U.S. should adapt its competitive policy to match its <b>economic</b> <b>realities.</b>|$|E

Sometimes new novelists will self-publish, because publishing houses will not risk the capital needed to market books by an unknown author to the public.|$|E

40|$|Do {{things such}} as {{performance}} indicators, valuation formulas, consumer tests, stock prices or financial contracts represent an external reality? Or do they rather constitute, in a performative fashion, what they refer to? The Provoked Economy tackles this question from a pragmatist angle, considering <b>economic</b> <b>reality</b> as a ceaselessly provoked reality. It takes the reader {{through a series of}} diverse empirical sites - from public administrations to stock exchanges, from investment banks to marketing facilities and business schools - in order to explore what can be seen from such a demanding standpoint. It demonstrates that descriptions of economic objects do actually produce economic objects and that the simulacrum of an economic act is indeed a form of realization. It also shows that provoking <b>economic</b> <b>reality</b> means facing practical tests in which what ought to be economic or not is subject to elaboration and controversy. This book opens paths for empirical investigation in the social sciences, but also for the philosophical renewal of the critique of <b>economic</b> <b>reality.</b> It will be useful for students and scholars in social theory, sociology, anthropology, philosophy and economics...|$|R
40|$|The way the <b>economic</b> <b>reality</b> is {{observed}} {{is essential in}} order to determine decision-making of economic subjects. The picture of <b>economic</b> <b>reality</b> drawn by accounting can be said to be either the true and fair, or biased. If the latter is the case, how much does that bias translate into the quality of economic decision-making? In summary, the paper analyzes whether accounting should provide the fair and true view whether it does, and how it affects the economic behavior when it does not on both micro-economic and macro-economic level. The arguments are built up on a logical structure rather taking a broader multidisciplinary approach to answer the previously stated questions...|$|R
25|$|Conditions in the {{predominant}} agricultural sector kept deteriorating between 1929 and 1939, {{which resulted in}} rural unrest and a progressive radicalization of the Polish peasant movement that became increasingly inclined toward militant anti-state activities.

According to Norman Davies, {{the failures of the}} Sanation regime (combined with the objective <b>economic</b> <b>realities)</b> caused a radicalization of the Polish masses {{by the end of the}} 1930s, but he warns against drawing parallels with the incomparably more destructive precedents of Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union under Stalin.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{the house}} was part of one of the main {{commercial}} centers of the city.

However, by {{the end of the}} 19th century, this area slowly ceased to be an area for the wealthy. More of the house was rented and adapted to lower-class tenants. The family tried to keep the upper part of the house for itself, but <b>economic</b> <b>realities</b> eventually forced them out of the house altogether to rent it entirely as tenements.|$|E
