30|$|First, {{the study}} empirically {{supports}} {{the claim that}} sustainable values encourage sustainable lifestyle practices. Altruistic values motivate consumers to help others and raise money for a cause by means of clothing care, <b>eco-citizenship,</b> fair trade and pro-environmentalism because consumers with altruistic values favorably undertake environmental actions (Guagnano et al. 1995). Consequently, altruistic values were highly engaged as <b>eco-citizenship</b> practices by limiting their consumption behavior but purchasing fair trade products. On the other hand, altruistic values’ results on green purchase intention were shown insignificant, which could imply that green products were to help other but rather perceive as marketing tools. Furthermore, altruistic and ecocentrism values did not considered recycling as sustainable lifestyle. In other words, a result for recycling were similar to Koch and Domina’s (1999) study that information of apparel recycling, accessibility for recycle options, and social norms for recycling could be relatively lacking. Thus, promoting jeans manufactured in an environmentally friendly way from recycled denim (Phau and Ong 2007) can be an effectual strategy which stimulates those consumer groups {{in favor of the}} concept of donating clothes for recycling and purchasing products for charity (Dickson 2000). Moreover, anthropocentrism and the ecocentrism values play an important feature in influencing sustainable lifestyle practices. Consumers who think that human beings control the environment believe in anthropocentrism (Nordlund and Garvill 2002). Thus, anthropocentrism values were shown to have most significant relationship on recycling and pro-environmentalism, indicating these group were highly opinionated on sustainable lifestyle. However, anthropocentrism and ecocentrism values were not shown relationship on clothing care and <b>eco-citizenship.</b> This result may be because they may have lack of information about clothing care or perceive clothing care as not sustainable lifestyle to environment. Thus, developing an ethical business framework can entice these particular consumers to exert an indirect influence by purchasing less harmful products to environments. Venturing out as the first ethically-driven sneaker brand from sourcing to the final product, Veja is one of few companies becoming successful as an ethical fashion brand (Poldner 2010) by inducing consumers to support protecting the environment as well as to fulfill high fashion sense and desire.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the decades}} {{the concept of}} green {{consumption}} has been discussed with sustainable consumption, green behavior, <b>eco-citizenship</b> and sustainable patterns and lifestyles. Various environmental problems like global warming, pollution, shortage {{of natural resources and}} climate change threatened the sustainability of the environment and our survival. There is an increasing demand from scholars and society for the change of human behavior to help reduce the environmental impact. This study aims to investigate how supermarket influences the daily consumption in a sustainable way through the concept of green marketing in terms of green product management, green packaging, green promotion, green pricing, green logistics and green labeling. That means, a supermarket is not only a place to provide green products but also influence the culture of green consumption through the efforts of designing environmentally friendly facilities and strategies. In real life practice, there are constraints and challenges to encourage green consumption in the community. Through literature review, interview and surveys, the study investigates the kinds of products and facilities which have been used in Hong Kong supermarkets and consumers’ perception and knowledge of environmentally friendly products and services. Through exploration of overseas case studies, insights on common sustainable practices were identified and how overseas’ best practices can be adopted or modified in Hong Kong were discussed. The surveys with Wellcome/Three Sixty/MarketPlace by Jasons and the general public illustrate how supermarket can promote sustainable and green consumption in Hong Kong and the progress of achievement. The study ends with suggestions on how joint-efforts from the various stakeholders in the society can facilitate green consumption. These include public participation, green initiatives of supermarkets, price incentive, promotion and government’s support to encourage pro-environmental behavior. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|E
40|$|The future role {{of nuclear}} power in global {{sustainable}} development, {{and particularly in the}} development of industrialising countries is contentious; the debate is often highly emotive. The Republic of South Africa's (RSA) progress towards its largest nuclear procurement program is taking place in the midst of changes within the African National Congress (ANC) ruling party, an increase in global demand for uranium and growing energy needs within South Africa. Major nuclear accidents such as Chernobyl or Fukushima have set nuclear power plant security on top of the public agenda. The internalisation of governance through the creation of responsible <b>eco-citizenship</b> is a primary technique to screen perceived risk, which works through the course of public participation. Participation however, must include those that drive the objectives within the nuclear context. Eskom's Koeberg Nuclear Power Station (KNPS) has a workforce of more than 2000 employees. In 2016, the Department of Energy (DOE) had decided that Africa's leading power utility will be the owner operator and procurer of the planned 9. 6 Gigawatts (GW) (e) nuclear fleet that is set out in the IRP 2010 report. The perceptual impact of this workforce that keeps the country's economic lifeblood moving is often understated, which was the focus of this study. This study had a distinct focus on what Eskom employee's perceptions are with respect to the IRP 2010 nuclear new build program. It was limited to the Western Cape Province and included views from divisions that may be involved in the realisation of the nuclear project. It is unique in its context, as very little has been documented on employee perception within RSA's nuclear industry. It is comparative to a public perception survey, which had a distinct focus on nuclear risk. The public's greatest concerns were noted to be corruption, project mismanagement, excessive cost and lack of trust in stakeholders. The outcome of this study discovered similarities with the public perception survey, however here within nuclear safety and compliance to business best practice were greater significant factors. Most respondents had sufficient knowledge and support for RSA's nuclear plans set out in the IRP reports. Dimensions of how perception was created were voted as being heavily dependent on the leadership within the organisation. With this in mind, Eskom employees have indicated that {{they are more likely to}} influence the public if they have their leadership's support, and have gone as far as selecting nuclear power over renewable energy to drive towards the country's commitment towards low greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. So while there may be shades of perceptual similarities between the public and Eskom employees, fundamentally this study revealed that these two bodies do not have the same perception on nuclear power. The study revealed that if Eskom employee's nuclear perception is disregarded and mismanaged, it may delay the realisation of the nuclear new build program in line with IRP 2010 timelines. This is mainly due to the concern of adherence to good corporate governance by Eskom's leadership...|$|E
40|$|The Organic Citizen investigates an {{underlying}} environmentalist sensibility that links texts and discourses from varied realms and disciplines - Indian reform, environmental policy, social reform, ecology, sociology and legislation. I contend that, taken together, these works narrate an ecological vision of national affiliation: {{a concept of}} the nation as an ecological, natural zone of interdependence and its citizens (or non-citizen inhabitants) as members of this environmentally-conceptualized nation. This shared narrative of natural collectivity gives rise to what I call an "organic citizen" - the literary-political figure of an individual imagined to be a natural member of an ecological national body. I show that this concept of <b>eco-citizenship</b> both informs and is informed by contemporaneous concepts of indigeneity (what it means to be native) and by the actual political positioning of the American Indian in the U. S. citizenry throughout the century. In five chapters, I argue that environmentalism is a site in which subjectivity is shaped, initially establishing modes of assimilative collectivity {{at the turn of the}} last century and later providing a realm in which the terms of subject affiliation may be analyzed and revised. I show how environmentalist discourse is profoundly connected to democratic practice and membership and how it formulates models of citizen collectivity. I contend that this discourse encompasses significantly more than a narrowly defined set of conservationist concerns for ecological entities, and can be used as a site of activism. Certain forms of stories - narratives that question these terms of national affiliation- expose the nuances of environmentalist thought. This type of storytelling offers a means through which environmentalist thought can become a realm of citizen engagement or activist possibility, opening access to and agency within a participatory democracy. An examination of this eco-narrative, I suggest, provides useful insights into how land use and rhetoric give definition to the way U. S. citizenship is socially imagined, legally adjudicated, and independently or communally practiced in a democratic system. The first chapter examines the simultaneous emergence of wilderness narratives with the science of ecology and discourses concerned about national and geographical assimilation of communities and individuals of ethnic difference. I draw upon the writings of social reformers, particularly Jane Addams, ecologists Henry Chandler Cowles and Frederick Clements, and environmentalists John Muir and Gifford Pinchot. Together, I argue they demonstrate how immigrant and impoverished subjects living in urban zones were rhetorically imagined and physically and metaphorically associated with natural entities. I contend that this literal naturalization makes immigrant presence less threatening to a national collective by converting these bodies and places into natural resources to be consumed for nationalist purposes. This version of citizenship imagines collectivity as a form of organicism, a process by which foreign subjects and non-citizens can be incorporated into a citizenry as natural resources while not necessarily legally constituted as citizens of the nation. While the rhetoric surrounding land use began to take new political, constitutional and sociocultural form in the first wave of a formal environmental movement, there simultaneously was a dramatic jurisprudential shift in Indian status in the U. S. This chapter explores how the formulation of an "organic citizen" at the turn of the century draws upon circulating concepts of indigeneity. I bring together Indian reform policy, specifically the Dawes Allotment Act, environmental policy, particularly the Antiquities Act, and fictional writings by Mary Austin and George Bird Grinnell. These narratives demonstrate the consistency with which American Indians were imagined as organically connected to natural lands. I argue that the result is a concept of indigenous organicism that is predicated upon the Indian being publicly, although uncomfortably, imagined as a natural constituent of a citizenry and Indian land as a natural part of a national body. 	 Chapter Three examines the fictional and political writings of Zitkala-Sa and Charles Eastman to consider how they use stories and their public roles to analyze the legal and discursive connections between an environmentalist sensibility and concepts of indigeneity. I contend that Eastman and Zitkala-Sa begin to use a language of rights and democracy within this eco-discourse as a way to insert the native as a rights-bearing citizen in the U. S. nation, putting forth a race analysis that ultimately disrupts the idea of ecological assimilation prevalent at the time. Reading their work alongside key environmental policies, like the Organic Act of 1916, Indian reforms, like the Citizenship Act of 1924, and Willa Cather's novel The Professor's House highlights the persistence of a concept of natural indigeneity that continued to be narrated even after American Indians are given legal citizenship. Eastman's and Zitkala-Sa's use of the environmentalist/native link as a means for race critique falls out of environmentalist thought and practice in a critical moment of transition in the environmental movement. Their use of storytelling and sense of political right, however, lays the foundation for the type of environmental narrative that emerges with the second stage of the environmental movement. My fourth chapter shifts to this moment, focusing on Aldo Leopold's A Sand County Almanac (1949) and Rachel Carson's Silent Spring (1962). I argue that both authors use an environmental narrative, particularly storytelling, as a means to imagine citizen engagement in a participatory democracy. However, while Leopold and Carson incorporate a language of political rights, they do not carefully factor into their versions of national/ecological belonging and action the ways in which race and class identities affect the social, political, and legal standing of various subjects within the eco-nation. My final chapter explores how a race and class critique in environmentalist thought and politics returns in the last quarter of the twentieth century. I draw from significant legislation and Supreme Court opinions that explicitly defined the political rights of ecological objects and species, such as Sierra Club v. Morton, the Endangered Species Act, and a series of legal battles that emerged around the construction of the Tellico Dam, particularly the Cherokees' resistance to its development. These documents and cases deliberate over the political standing and rights of natural, non-human entities, but they circumnavigate engagement with questions of political standing for geographically and socially marginalized human citizens in the U. S., although this issue is implicitly present and strategically drawn upon in their arguments. This lost component takes shape and political articulation in the following emergence of the environmental justice movement. The politics of voice - "speaking for oneself" - that emerges particularly out of indigenous environmental justice movements highlights the use of storytelling as an activist practice. In their careful novelization of environmental activism, Linda Hogan's Solar Storms (1995) and Ruth Ozeki's All Over Creation (2003) not only pinpoint the interconnections, but also the injustices that arise out of the way human and ecological subjectivities are legally and culturally constructed. I argue that both authors use the literary form to model how stories and the act of storytelling allow for the articulation of and/or resistance to certain terms of national affiliation. Both Hogan's and Ozeki's novels bring forth an expanded sense of environmentalism, showing that storytelling can redefine our roles as U. S. citizens and position ourselves as active agents in democratic discourse, policy-making and change. We are living in another pivotal moment of environmentalist thought as new attention is given to the way environmental conditions are deteriorating and as popular culture begins to take interest in these issues. It is crucial that Literary Studies rigorously engage with these issues to examine the kinds of narratives being generated. While Ecocriticism and Native American Studies have remained somewhat marginalized from the core of Literary Studies, this project (particularly in this moment) argues that these types of criticism and theory have an imperative role to play in illuminating narratives of identity, nation, and citizenship.
