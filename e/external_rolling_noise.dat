40|$|From November 2012 all {{passenger}} car tyres, light truck tyres and heavy duty vehicle tyres {{sold on the}} aftermarket in the European Union must have a label classifying the <b>external</b> <b>rolling</b> <b>noise,</b> the fuel efficiency, and the wet grip. This regulation puts a focus on optimisation of the tyre de- sign with respect to all these parameters at once. Up to today these three parameters have been treated rather independently. There is little to no detailed information available {{on the relationship between}} rolling noise generation, rolling resistance, and grip of car tyres besides empirical data based on measurements. Today, simulation models that can simulate all these effects at once have just started to emerge. This paper gives a brief presentation of the past and the most resent develop- ment of numerical tyre/road interaction models with focus on external noise, rolling resistance, and grip. Today, the simulation models can be used to gain fundamental knowledge about the tyre/road interaction process and the resulting noise, rolling resistance, and grip. Models for combined opti- misation of rolling resistance and noise emissions exists, and are just about to be used in preliminary investigations. Models that in addition give results for grip are still under development...|$|E
40|$|Directivity is an {{important}} parameter to describe a sound source. For railway <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> this becomes a complicated issue because its vertical and horizontal directivities depend on many factors. In this paper a complete procedure to determine the vertical and horizontal directivities of railway <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> in one-third octave bands has been proposed. The procedure consists of two parts: (1) to define the vertical and horizontal directivities both for track and wheel radiations; (2) to determine the effective vertical and horizontal directivities for the total railway <b>rolling</b> <b>noise.</b> For practical reasons {{it is better to}} include the shielding effect of the car-body, also the low barriers when they are present alongside a track. Since this shielding effect dominates, the inclusive vertical directivity of railway <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> can vary with train types, and will also be different when influenced by low barriers (such as viaducts). The horizontal directivity of railway <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> is determined by the horizontal directivities of the track and wheel radiations, and weighted by the relative importance of the two sub-sources which is described by the track and vehicle transfer functions. In general, the horizontal directivity of railway <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> varies with different vehicle-track combinations...|$|R

Actually <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> reduction methods are:- particular tyre engraving shape;- absorbing pavements. In this paper alternative active methods for <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> reduction are proposed and compared. Such a methods have been applied by realizing original prototypes which work on steady conditions with a previous recorded <b>rolling</b> <b>noise.</b> A future prototype is also proposed which is a dynamical system the working conditions of which {{are very close to}} the effective ones...|$|R
40|$|Environmental factors, {{especially}} {{humidity and}} temperature, may influence wheel/rail contact behaviours {{by changing the}} friction coefficient, resulting in railway <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> changes. Friction modifiers (FMs) are now commonly used in the railway industry to manage and/or mitigate rail roughness growth and high noise levels in curves. Although the three factors {{have the potential to}} reduce <b>rolling</b> <b>noise,</b> there is little corresponding quantification of their effects available. In this paper, a series of experiments were performed with a two disk test rig to investigate their effect on <b>rolling</b> <b>noise.</b> A Railway Rolling Noise Prediction Software (RRNPS) model is then modified to simulate it. It is noted that the effect of humidity, temperature and FMs is small to negligible under the present conditions tested. However, through comparisons between simulations and measurements, the modified RRNPS model can reasonably predict the trend of the three factors effect on <b>rolling</b> <b>noise.</b> This may provide useful insight to the control of railway noise...|$|R
40|$|The road {{transportation}} sector places a severe burden on {{large parts of}} the population in the form of road traffic noise. A main contributor to this is the <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> generated by the tires of trucks and other heavy vehicles. Advanced simulation tools are not only needed for a better physical understanding of <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> generation, but also for the design of quieter tires and road surfaces. So far the development of suitable simulation tools for the prediction of <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> has mostly been focussed on car tires. Whether results are applicable to truck tires as well remains unclear. In this study an advanced tool which previously has been successfully used for the simulation of car tire <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> is extended and applied to a 315 / 80 R 22. 5 truck tire. The sound radiation for steady-state rolling on different road surfaces is calculated and compared to measurements. Very good agreement between simulations and measurements is achieved for the total A-weighted sound pressure level. The agreement between measured and simulated third-octave band spectra is generally good. Finally, the number of different road surface texture scans which are available for a particular road is identified as an important parameter for the quality of the simulations...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn France and in {{many western}} countries, {{standard}} housing buildings often include commercial surfaces on the ground floor. While providing appreciated services during day time, this arrangement may cause highly perturbating noise in the upper floors of the building due to delivery operations. In particular, delivering and shelving operations include displacements of trolleys resulting in <b>rolling</b> and impact <b>noise.</b> Contrary to impact noise which is considered in the actual standards, <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> is not addressed. This is critical since impact excitation has little similarities with excitation due to e. g. a <b>rolling</b> trolley. Therefore, <b>noise</b> treatments designed with impact sound source may not be suitable for <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> sources. Based on measured illustrations of this problematic, the present work aims at designing a general methodology (i) to characterise the <b>rolling</b> <b>noise,</b> (ii) to predict the noise reduction efficiency and (iii) to design/optimise the noise control treatment. Discussion is based on measured data of acceleration spectra obtained for several types of surfaces (flat concrete, tiled/paved floor).

This methodology allows to understand mechanisms of noise reduction and offers interesting perspectives for designing improved sound proofing materials...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{considerable}} {{effort has}} been spent at a European level to establish comprehensive methods for the experimental assessment of <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> emission of rail-bound vehicles and tracks. This work was concentrated in the European METARAIL and STAIRRS projects. The objective of these was to improve the accuracy and the reproducibility of pass-by noise measurements compared to the standards that were current at that time. A further aim was to develop experimental methods separately to identify the contributions to <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> of the vehicles and the tracks. In these projects, measurement methods were developed that could determine the combined wheel/rail roughness and the ‘transfer functions’ for the vehicle and the track, that is, the separate noise contributions per unit roughness. The roughness and transfer function spectra provide a powerful basis by which vehicles and tracks can be characterized by measurement, to a high extent, independent of the running speed and site conditions. Such {{a description of the}} track and rolling stock allows the prediction of <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> spectra for different combinations of vehicles and track from those at which the characteristics have been measured. The measurement effort is limited; only straightforward one-third octave band measurements of pass-by sound pressure and vertical railhead vibration are needed. This paper describes the method, giving the derivation of the calculation by which the roughness levels, transfer function spectra levels and the vibration decay rates in the track are determined from the measured quantities. Typical results are shown. Among other applications, the method allows fast assessment of wheel roughness for whole vehicles or trains, speed-independent assessment of the effectiveness of track and vehicle noise control measures and the separation of <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> from noise due to other sources...|$|R

The determination of the directivity of <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> is discussed in detail. For the directivities of traction noise and aerodynamic noise the discussion is more analytical because of limited access to relevant data. For each type of main railway noise source, i. e. <b>rolling</b> <b>noise,</b> traction noise and aerodynamic noise, default directivity functions are proposed for the use in the source description of railway noise.

40|$|CO 2 {{emissions}} and traffic noise {{are two major}} environmental issues associated with road traffic. Increased efforts are made to develop suitable simulation tools for the prediction of tyre rolling losses and <b>rolling</b> <b>noise.</b> The accurate description of the tyre/road interaction under rolling conditions is crucial for these simulations. Besides an accurate contact model, input data of sufficiently high quality is required. Ac- cordingly, the measurement effort for the road roughness profiles is high: in the rolling direction distances of several meters need to be scanned at positions less than a millimetre apart. While in the lateral direction a lower resolution can be accepted, still between ten and twenty parallel profile tracks are required under perfect conditions. Yet, in reality road surface scans are typically restricted to very few lateral tracks due to limited resources. This study evaluates how rolling resistance and <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> simulations are affected {{if the number of}} independent lateral road scans is less than the number of lateral tracks in the contact model. Different schemes for extrapolating the missing lateral information from the available data are tested for several tyre/road combinations. It is shown that a certain number of parallel road surface scans is necessary for accurate prediction of <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> and <b>rolling</b> resistance...|$|R
40|$|Combined {{sound and}} {{vibration}} measurements during train pass-bys {{can be used}} to quantify contributions from the excitation and transmission of <b>rolling</b> <b>noise.</b> This is useful for the identification of sound sources and the assessment of the track contribution. In this paper, a practical application on a high-speed track is discussed. Acoustic measurements were conducted on a high-speed slab track, with pass-bys of the Thalys and conventional intercity trains, at speeds of around 300 and 160 km/h, respectively. Both sound pressure and vertical rail vibrations were recorded simultaneously. These were used to derive an estimate for the vertical track decay rates, combined effective roughness and transfer functions, with the Pass-by Analysis Software (PBA). The transfer function of the slab track is compared with a conventional concrete sleeper track, showing a distinct difference in the low and medium frequency ranges. The transfer function is characteristic of <b>rolling</b> <b>noise,</b> and if also measured at high speed, the contribution of aerodynamic noise can be quantified. For this train/track combination, aerodynamic sound sources are shown to contribute to the pass-by levels mainly in the lower frequency range. Based on the transfer functions and roughness levels, it is shown that <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> is still a significant noise source up to 300 km/h. © 2012 Springer...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} tool to {{optimize}} the mix design of low-noise pavements. An experimental model was developed to predict the <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> of a reference car tire {{as a function of}} the composition and volumetric characteristics of mixes obtained from in-service pavements. The model enables an analyst to identify which composition parameters need to be altered to improve the acoustic performance of a low-noise pavement. To define the experimental model, several types of asphalt surface layers composed of hot-mix asphalt mixtures with different void contents, different aggregate grading, and different bitumen percentages were analyzed in situ and by laboratory tests. The acoustical properties of pavement surfaces were evaluated by the close-proximity method. The model was defined by using a multivariate nonlinear regression technique to relate composition and volumetric characteristics of asphalt mixtures with <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> levels recorded at different speeds. This model, which is a function of several significant parameters of asphalt mixture composition and tire speed, has proved to be highly reliable in predicting car tire <b>rolling</b> <b>noise.</b> Because the model enables the identification of mixture characteristics that require modification in relation to the specific value of the mean traffic speed, it is particularly useful for the optimization of low-noise pavement mix design...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of the Quiet-Track project is to provide step-changing track based noise mitigation and maintenance schemes for railway <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> in LRT (Light Rail Transit) networks. WP 4 in particular focuses on the combination of existing track based solutions to yield a global performance of at least 6. dB(A). The validation was carried out using a track section in the network of Athens Metro Line 1 with an existing outside concrete slab track (RHEDA track) where high airborne <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> was observed. The procedure for the selection of mitigation measures is based on numerical simulations, combining WRNOISE and IMMI software tools for noise prediction with experimental determination of the required track and vehicle parameters (e. g., rail and wheel roughness). The availability of a detailed <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> calculation procedure allows for detailed designing of measures and of ranking individual measures. It achieves this by including the modelling of the wheel/rail source intensity and of the noise propagation {{with the ability to}} evaluate the effect of modifications at source level (e. g., grinding, rail dampers, wheel dampers, change in resiliency of wheels and/or rail fixation) and of modifications in the propagation path (absorption at the track base, noise barriers, screening). A relevant combination of existing solutions was selected in the function of the simulation results. Three distinct existing solutions were designed in detail aiming at a high <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> attenuation and not affecting the normal operation of the metro system: Action 1 : implementation of sound absorbing precast elements (panel type) on the track bed, Action 2 : implementation of an absorbing noise barrier with a height of 1. 10 - 1. 20. m above rail level, and Action 3 : installation of rail dampers.

Apart from measurement data, however, information {{about the relationship between}} rolling resistance and <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> generation is scarce. It is the goal of this study to investigate the fundamental physical processes connecting both areas. Additionally, it is evaluated whether a simultaneous reduction of both rolling resistance and <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> is possible or if this is contradicting requirement. A previously presented model for simulating the structural dynamics and rolling resistance of a rolling car tyre is extended to allow <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> calculation. The approach is based on a waveguide finite element model of the tyre. Tyre/road contact forces are obtained using a non-linear 3 D contact model. The velocity field on the tyre surface is used to determine the radiated sound pressure based on a boundary element method. In a parameter study it is evaluated how much dissipation and sound radiation are affected by material properties, tyre construction and road surfaces. Due to the characteristics of the modelling approach, detailed information about dissipation and sound generation in different frequency regions, wave orders or parts of the tyre is available. The results show that rolling resistance and radiation are mainly low wave order, low frequency phenomena which are, at least partly, controlled by the same set of modes. This suggests that by modifying specific tyre properties reductions in both sound radiation and rolling resistance can be achieved...|$|R

Yet, apart from empirical data based on measurements, there is little information concerning the relationship between rolling resistance and <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> generation. The purpose of this work {{is to establish a}} simulation framework which allows to explore the underlying physical processes connecting both areas. Special emphasis is put on the development of an accurate and efficient condensation procedure for the estimation of the necessary tyre input data from detailed design data available to the manufacturer. The method is exemplified by the derivation of the input deck for a 175 / 65 R 14 tyre which was previously not implemented in the modelling tool. For the simulations a waveguide finite element model of the car tyre is combined with a non-linear 3 D model of the tyre/road contact to simulate the structural dynamics of a tyre rolling under steady-state conditions on a real road. Rolling resistance is calculated based on the power input into the tyre while the velocity field on the tyre surface is used to determine the radiated sound pressure based on a boundary element method approach. The applicability of the approach is shown by calculating rolling resistance and sound radiation for an initial setup of modelling parameters. In the further course of the study the influence of a variety of modelling parameters on the outcome of the rolling loss and <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> simulations is investigated. A number of key parameters for the simulation of {{one or both of the}} quantities are identified. It can be shown that especially the contact stiffness and the geometry of the BEM mesh are crucial parameters for the <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> simulations.

In spite of this, {{there is a lack of}} suitable simulation tools for the prediction of <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> and <b>rolling</b> resistance and the investigation of the relevant physical processes behind these two quanti- ties. The purpose of this thesis is to establish a simulation framework which allows for the exploration of the underlying physical processes for rolling resistance and <b>rolling</b> <b>noise.</b> For this, an acoustical tyre/road interaction model aimed at calcu- lating <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> is extended and combined with a module for the calculation of rolling losses. The proposed tool consists of a waveguide finite element model of the tyre, which is combined with a non-linear three-dimensional tyre/road contact model to simulate the structural dynamics of a tyre rolling under steady-state con- ditions on a real road. Rolling resistance is calculated based on the input power into the tyre while the velocity field on the tyre surface is used to determine the radiated sound pressure based on a boundary element method. Tyre vibrations, <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> and/or <b>rolling</b> resistance are calculated for different car and truck tyres and a wide selection of road surfaces. There is good agreement with mea- surements for both quantities, making this the first tool which can be successfully used for the simulation of both rolling resistance and <b>rolling</b> <b>noise.</b> The method is especially suitable for extended parameter studies because of its numerical ef- ficiency. A number of important research questions are investigated. It is shown that rolling resistance can be split into two parts: one part originating from the large-scale tyre structure deformations, and another part arising from small-scale tread indentations which are highly dependent on road surface texture. An inves- tigation of the free wave propagation on a truck tyre indicates that the structural differences between car and truck tyres lead to some differences in the vibrational behaviour. Additionally, it is investigated how well a certain road surface section is represented by a limited number of road surface scans. It is shown that for most applications and surfaces a minimum number of scan lines from different sample locations are needed if simulation results should be representative of the whole surface...|$|R

For efficient applications to road surfaces, an appropriate partition of the surface has been used in addition with an analytical load/penetration relation for a single road asperity. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the method, numerical contact forces for a small sample of road are compared to those obtained with a classical matrix inversion method.

Through comparisons of predictions with measurements for four types of wheel and one track type, it is shown that the TWINS model gives reliable predictions.

Such a criterion may be useful for planning of rail grinding intervals if used together with a system for regular monitoring of rail roughness levels. It is concluded that the importance of controlling rail roughness increases with increasing train speed.

Because of the large existence of small radius curves, metro lines are particularly affected. This case study is performed {{as part of a}} project which aims at developing a numerical tool for prediction of rail corrugation growth on curves. The development of corrugation on a 120 m radius curve of the Stockholm metro has been monitored by repeated measurements of rail roughness and train pass-by noise. Within a grinding interval of 1 year, severe short-pitch corrugation was build up with maximum peak-to-peak magnitudes of about 0. 15 mm. Spectral analysis of measurement data shows large roughness magnitudes in the wavelength interval 4 - 14 cm, with peaks at approximately 5 cm and 8 cm. The corrugation pattern has a pure longitudinal direction (with corrugation ridges transverse to the track direction) and an irregularly varying magnitude along the 100 m long measured track section. The roughness growth rate increased with time until 300 days after rail grinding, thereafter only moderate additional roughness growth was observed. Because of moderate train speeds of about 30 km/h, the <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> caused by the corrugation has a low-frequency content (< 200 Hz). A 10. 1 dB unit increase (139 - 300 days after grinding) in roughness level in the wavelength interval 4 - 14 cm was found to correspond to an increase in <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> level in the frequency interval 60 - 200 Hz of 4. 9 dB.

Traction noise will be important at low speeds and around stations and switchyards. Aerodynamic noise will become a concern when high speed trains will have been introduced in Sweden in future. The HARMONOISE-IMAGINE model has provided the guidelines for handling these noise sources...|$|R
30|$|High-speed train {{noise level}} is an {{important}} factor with respect to passenger comfort and life quality of residents along the railway. Determining how to attenuate the noise level {{is an important}} research direction that train designers care about [36, 37]. Studies show that train noise is a kind of mixed signal which is made up of train body vibration, <b>rolling</b> <b>noise,</b> aerodynamic noise, device noise, etc. [37]. Separating individual noise components from the overall observations will provide some guide to train noise reduction design. Since the noise component is of interest, here we use “noise signal” or “noise component” to distinguish it from the common use of “noise” for undesired interference.|$|R
40|$|A refined {{model of}} a railway vehicle running on a {{straight}} track is developed. In this model the wheelsets and the rails are modelled as flexible bodies and a detailed model of the wheel-rail contact is used. The simulation results obtained with this model show a distinct impact of the structural deformations on the stress distributions in the contact. This refined model {{can serve as a}} base for investigations of <b>rolling</b> <b>noise</b> and wear...|$|R
30|$|During vehicle/track interaction, {{the forces}} are {{transmitted}} in the wheel/rail contact area: dynamic behavior {{is found in}} a wide band, ranging from very low frequencies of 0.5 – 1  Hz for lateral and vertical car body accelerations, to 2000  Hz, {{as a consequence of}} geometrical irregularities in rail and wheel contact. This latter portion of high-frequency excitation content typically falls in the audible frequency range, inducing the most relevant contribution to <b>rolling</b> <b>noise.</b>|$|R
