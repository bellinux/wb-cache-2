In addition to <b>direct</b> <b>subsidies,</b> the federal government maintained military posts, provided safety from Indian attacks, bankrolled treaty obligations, conducted surveys and land sales, built roads, staffed land offices, made harbour improvements, and subsidized overland mail delivery. Territorial citizens came to both decry federal power and local corruption, {{and at the same}} time, lament that more federal dollars were not sent their way.|$|E

25|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>subsidies</b> {{are paid}} to farmers. This was {{originally}} intended to encourage farmers to choose to grow those crops attracting subsidies and maintain home-grown supplies. Subsidies were generally paid on the area of land growing a particular crop, {{rather than on the}} total amount of crop produced. Reforms implemented from 2005 are phasing out specific subsidies in favour of flat-rate payments based only on the area of land in cultivation, and for adopting environmentally beneficial farming methods. The change is intended to give farmers more freedom to choose for themselves those crops most in demand and reduce the economic incentive to overproduce.|$|E

25|$|Farming is subsidised, with {{subsidies}} to farmers totalling £3.19 billion (after deduction of levies) paid in 2010. These subsidies are mostly channelled through the EU Common Agricultural Policy from member states' contributions. UK farmers receive the fifth largest agricultural subsidy in the EU, with 7% of the subsidy, after France (17%), Spain (13%), Germany (12%), and Italy (10%). There is {{downward pressure on}} the subsidies and on 19 November 2010, the EU announced a reform starting in 2013.

25|$|Governments {{may choose}} to give {{subsidies}} to rail operation, since rail transport has fewer externalities than other dominant modes of transport. If the railway company is state-owned, the state may simply provide <b>direct</b> <b>subsidies</b> in exchange for increased production. If operations have been privatized, several options are available. Some countries have a system where the infrastructure is owned by a government agency or company– with open access to the tracks for any company that meets safety requirements. In such cases, the state {{may choose to}} provide the tracks free of charge, or for a fee that does not cover all costs. This is seen as analogous to the government providing free access to roads. For passenger operations, a direct subsidy may be paid to a public-owned operator, or public service obligation tender may be helt, and a time-limited contract awarded to the lowest bidder. Total EU rail subsidies amounted to €73 billion in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Financing and Subsidies Urban {{water and}} {{sanitation}} systems do not receive <b>direct</b> <b>subsidies</b> and are financed through the capital market, and ultimately through user fees. However, Chile has an innovative system of means-tested subsidies that allows qualifying poor households to receive a subsidy administered by the municipalities to pay parts of their {{water and sanitation}} bills. Rural water systems receive a partial investment subsidy that is defined in the Ley del Subsidio al Agua Potable y Saneamiento. By law, the subsidy can cover 25-85 percent of a household's water and sewer bill up to 15m³ per month. The client pays {{the rest of the}} bill. Beyond 15m³, households are charged full price. The subsidy is meant to target only those households that are unable to buy water at a subsistence level and is based on willingness to pay. In 1998, about 13% of households benefited at a level of ~$10 per month. The total cost of the program in 1998 was US $36million. Opponents argue this subsidy program can act as a regressive policy and actually hurt the poor because a false assumption is made that high consumption is positively correlated to high income. On the contrary, poor families {{do not have access to}} efficient methods of using water in cooking, cleaning, and washing.|$|E
