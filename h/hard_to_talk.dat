5|$|Some of his {{selections}} as captain {{were widely}} debated. Following {{incidents in the}} Caribbean, Trueman did not play for England again under Hutton's captaincy, although he was still regarded as an England prospect. Jim Laker was also omitted from the team, possibly because Hutton doubted Laker's commitment. Both Jim McConnon, Laker's replacement, and Vic Wilson were controversial choices for the 1954–55 Australian tour, whose selections Trevor Bailey attributed to Hutton; neither played a substantial role on the tour. A poor communicator, Hutton distanced himself from his team when a stronger lead was required. Trueman and Bailey thought Hutton found it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to his players: amateur critics considered this an inevitable consequence of a professional leading other professionals. On the other hand, Hutton {{played a key role}} in the development of fast bowlers Trueman, Tyson and Brian Statham. Tyson and Statham later acknowledged his advice and encouragement as factor in their subsequent success. Cowdrey also acknowledged Hutton's advice and assistance when the former began his career. Furthermore, on the 1954–55 tour of Australia, Hutton took a close interest in him and was a particular comfort when Cowdrey's father died during the tour.|$|E

The meetings of families could be equally traumatic, with wives and husbands meeting again for the first time in five years and discovering they had lived very different lives which were <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about. Those who had been evacuated were told that it was tougher in the islands. Alderney residents were not allowed to return to their island until December 1945.|$|E
500|$|Her third album, Maya, tackled {{information}} {{politics in}} the digital age, loaded with technological references and love songs, and deemed by Kitty Empire writing in The Observer to be her most melancholic and mainstream effort. Her genocide-depicting 2010 video for the single [...] "Born Free" [...] was deemed by Ann Powers writing in the Los Angeles Times to be [...] "concentrating fully" [...] on the physical horror of gun butts and bullets hitting flesh, with the scenes giving added poignancy to the lyrical themes of the song. Interpreted as a comment on the Arizona immigration law, America's military might and desensitised attitudes towards violence, others found that the video stressed that genocide still exists and violent repression remains commonplace. Some critics described the film as [...] "sensationalist". Neda Ulaby of NPR described the video as intended for [...] "shock value" [...] {{in the service of}} nudging people into considering real issues that can be <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about. M.I.A. revealed that she felt [...] "disconnected" [...] during the writing process, and spoke of the Internet inspiration and themes of information politics that could be found in the songs and the artwork.|$|E

500|$|Randy Jackson {{contributed to}} four tracks on the album, {{and said it}} was [...] "the most real and honest record she's made. She didn't care what anyone thought of the lyrics. They were only {{important}} to her." [...] Carey included a cover of [...] Def Leppard's song [...] "Bringin' On the Heartbreak". During the photo shoot for Charmbracelet at Capri, Carey happened to listen to Def Leppard's greatest hits album [...] (1995), which contains the song, and decided to cover it. In an interview with Billboard, Carey said that the song is [...] "an example of her musical diversity". Jackson also worked on [...] "My Saving Grace", which Carey said describes her thoughts about the writing, recording and mastering process. While working in Capri, Carey's father became ill with cancer and she returned to New York {{to spend some time with}} him; he died soon after. In his memory, Carey wrote and produced the song [...] "Sunflowers for Alfred Roy". Carey said that the song represents [...] "his side of the family and is kind of <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about." [...] The song proved to be [...] "very emotional" [...] for Carey, and she sang it only once in the studio. DJ Quik also produced songs for the album, but none of them were included.|$|E
500|$|Despite Fischer's results against Taimanov and Larsen, his {{upcoming}} match against Petrosian seemed a daunting task. Nevertheless, the Soviet government {{was concerned about}} Fischer. [...] "Reporters asked Petrosian whether the match would last the full twelve games... 'It might be possible that I win it earlier,' Petrosian replied", and then stated: [...] "Fischer's [...] wins do not impress me. He is a great chess player but no genius." [...] Petrosian played a strong [...] in the first game, gaining the advantage, but Fischer eventually won the game after Petrosian faltered. This gave Fischer a run of 20 consecutive wins against the world's top players (in the Interzonal and Candidates matches), a winning streak topped only by Steinitz's 25 straight wins in 1873–1882. Petrosian won the second game, finally snapping Fischer's streak. After three consecutive draws, Fischer swept the next four games to win the match 6½–2½ (+5−1=3). Sports Illustrated ran {{an article on the}} match, highlighting Fischer's domination of Petrosian as being due to Petrosian's outdated system of preparation:Fischer's recent record raises the distinct possibility that he has made a breakthrough in modern chess theory. His response to Petrosian's elaborately plotted 11th move in the first game is an example: Russian experts had worked on the variation for weeks, yet when it was thrown at Fischer suddenly, he faced its consequences alone and won by applying simple, classic principles. Upon completion of the match, Petrosian remarked: [...] "After the sixth game Fischer really did become a genius. I on the other hand, either had a breakdown or was tired, or something else happened, but the last three games were no longer chess." [...] "Some experts kept insisting that Petrosian was off form, and that he should have had a plus score {{at the end of the}} sixth game..." [...] to which Fischer replied, [...] "People have been playing against me below strength for fifteen years." [...] Fischer's match results befuddled Botvinnik: [...] "It is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about Fischer's matches. Since the time that he has been playing them, miracles have begun." [...] "When Petrosian played like Petrosian, Fischer played like a very strong grandmaster, but when Petrosian began making mistakes, Fischer was transformed into a genius." ...|$|E

[...] Christian Music Zine's Anthony Peronto praised the chemistry and group dynamic between Beautiful Eulogy's three members. He concluded that With nary a flaw to be found and undeniable growth by each member, Beautiful Eulogy have exceeded all expectations and delivered their best work yet. Though I want to resist repeating my thoughts on Beautiful Eulogy's debut album I can't say {{it any other way}} than this slight paraphrasing: This is the most musically creative hip hop album I've heard since, well... Satellite Kite. Jessica Cooper of Indie Vision Music summarized that All of Instruments of Mercy is fresh in sound, featuring loops of new beats and sounds that stick to the lyrics like glue. Beautiful Eulogy continues to be consistent in their collaborative works and are undoubtedly blessed with the words and musical talent to produce something that's cohesive, poetic, and undeniably beautiful from beginning to end. Jesus Freak Hideout's Mark Rice praised the rapping skills of Odd Thomas and Braille, Courtland Urbano's production, and the lyrical focus of the album. He remarked that [...] "It is hard not to marvel at the sheer talent of these three individuals, whether it is in the crisp vocals, wonderful production, or the dense and theologically provoking lyrics." ...|$|E

[...] "The shows I played between the time I got the word about Layne and Layne's funeral were very important to me in terms of being able to continue on. It's {{one of those things where}} if you take a break and allow things to settle in, it might be harder to get up again." [...] Cantrell's manager at the time, Bill Siddons, said: [...] "Jerry really loved Layne. They had a bond I haven't seen before." [...] Asked about Staley's death in an interview with MTV in July 2002, Cantrell said: [...] "It's something I'm still dealing with, and I still think like he's here. I miss him tremendously. I love him and have to move on. I'll remember him and respect the memories of what we did together and just enjoy life... and that's all I'll say about it." [...] William DuVall, who performed Staley's vocals during Cantrell's solo concerts, elaborated on this emotional period saying: [...] "I lost my grandfather in the same week, so Cantrell and I both hit the road with immense personal losses dogging us. There were times on stage—there was one show in Charlotte where it was just so heavy. I'm holding back tears onstage, and Jerry would start crying onstage too a lot at that point, and a lot of times we would just look at each other when we were singing the stuff because it was the only way... it was heavy. I can't quantify it really in words." [...] Cantrell canceled the show that he was scheduled to perform at Zephyrhills's Livestock Festival on April 28 in order to attend Staley's funeral in Seattle in the same day. Cantrell dedicated his solo album, Degradation Trip, released two months after Staley's death, to his memory. He also adopted Staley's cat, a female siamese named Sadie, after his death. The cat appeared on Cantrell's episode of MTV Cribs, which was shot at his ranch in Oklahoma in September 2002. Sadie died on the same night of Alice in Chains' concert in Seattle on October 8, 2010, aged 18.|$|E

To assess the views as to the effectiveness and acceptability of a family therapy clinic in a north London surgery, questionnaires were given to general practitioners referring patients, and to clients.

The clinic proved to be highly acceptable for clients, with 90 % agreeing that it was easier to attend a clinic at the practice than at a hospital; and only one patient thought that knowing the general practitioner worked in the practice made it <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> openly. Eighty per cent of patients felt the problem had improved at the time of follow up. Where the problem had not improved, 60 % felt that they were dealing with it better.
