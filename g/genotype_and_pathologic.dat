40|$|Introduction: HPV {{infection}} has a prime etiologic role {{in development}} and progression of cervical cancer, {{one of the}} most frequent forms of cancer among women in developing countries. This study was designed to determine the most prevalent HPV genotypes in women with normal and abnormal cervical cytology in Iran. Materials and Methods: Samples from 134 patients, including 127 who attended gynecology clinics and 7 with solid cervical tumors were used. All 127 patients underwent routine Pap tests for cytological evaluation and at the same visit a sample of cervical epithelial cells was obtained by scraping the cervix osteum. In each case HPV infection was primarily evaluated by PCR using GP 5 / 6 primers and then subtyping was performed in proved infected samples with specific primers for HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 11 and 6. After cytological evaluation, 50 patients with abnormal Pap tests were categorized as the abnormal group and the remaining 77 patients as the normal group. Results: In the normal group, HPV infection was established in 10 cases (13 % infection rate), while 30 HPV positive cases were discovered in the abnormal group (60 % infected). The most prevalent genotypes among the infected samples were HPV 16 (76 %), HPV 18 (12. 7 %) and HPV 11 / 6 (8. 5 %). Moreover, all 7 tumor samples were positive for HPV general primers of which, 5 samples were infected with HPV 16, two were co-infected with HPV 16, 18 and HPV 16, 31 <b>genotypes</b> <b>and</b> one was infected with HPV 18. Conclusions: Infection with HPV 16 was found to be significantly higher in abnormal group in comparison with normal group (42 % vs. 11. 6 %, P value < 0. 005), likewise HPV 18 genotypes were proved to be more prevalent in abnormal group (8 % vs. 0 %, P value < 0. 05). No significant relation between other HPV <b>genotypes</b> <b>and</b> <b>pathologic</b> cervical changes was obtained. According to our study high rates of infection with HPV genotypes in sexually active Iranian women makes molecular investigation for HPV 16 and 18 very essential in clinical approaches to patients with proven dysplasia in their screening tests and also for those patients with borderline (i. e. ASCUS) or incongruous pathology reports. Larger studies are required to determine the most appropriate vaccine with highest protection in Iranian women...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Genetic polymorphisms in genes {{encoding}} for enzymes {{involved in}} the biotransformation of carcinogens {{have been shown to}} be relevant as risk for cancer and may be of considerable importance from a public health point of view. Considering that N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT 2) polymorphisms modulate the response to ionizing radiation, the strongest risk factor recognized to cause differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) thus far, we sought to determine the influence of NAT 2 detoxification system on thyroid cancer susceptibility. Experimental Design: We conducted a prospective case-control study, comparing 195 patients presenting with DTC that were previously genotyped for GSTT 1, GSTM 1, GSTP 1, and CYP 1 A 1, comprising 164 papillary carcinomas and 31 follicular carcinomas, with 196 control individuals paired for gender, age, ethnicity, diet routine, lifetime occupational history, smoking history, general health conditions, and previous diseases. We used PCR-RFLP assays and the combination of 6 variant alleles to define 18 NAT 2 haplotypes that characterized slow, intermediate, or rapid phenotypes. Results: A multivariate logistic regression analysis identified the presence of * 12 A and the absence of * 12 B, * 13, * 14 B, * 14 D, * 6 A, and * 7 A NAT 2 haplotypes as risk factors for DTC. The inheritance of a rapid acetylation phenotype doubled the risk for a papillary carcinoma (odds ratio, 2. 024; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 252 - 3. 272). We found no relationship between <b>genotypes</b> <b>and</b> clinical, <b>pathologic,</b> or laboratory features of patients or between <b>genotypes</b> <b>and</b> outcome. Conclusions: We showed that NAT 2 <b>genotypes</b> <b>and</b> the NAT 2 rapid acetylation phenotype are important susceptibility factors for DTC, suggesting that NAT 2 detoxification system is involved in this tumor pathogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Macrophage {{inhibitory}} cytokine- 1 (MIC- 1) is a divergent {{member of}} the tumor growth factor ß (TGF-ß) superfamily. Several observations suggest that it {{plays a role in}} colorectal carcinoma (CRC). In particular, MIC- 1 is markedly up-regulated in colorectal cancers as well as in premalignant adenomas. This study examines the relationship of serum MIC- 1 levels <b>and</b> <b>genotypes</b> to clinical <b>and</b> <b>pathologic</b> features of colonic neoplasia. Experimental Design: We confirmed the presence of MIC- 1 in CRC tissue and the cell line CaCo- 2. The normal range for serum MIC- 1 levels was defined in 260 healthy blood donors, and the differences between normal subjects and 193 patients having adenomatous polyps or CRC were then determined. In a separate cohort of 224 patients, we evaluated the relationship of MIC- 1 serum level <b>and</b> <b>genotype</b> to standard tumor parameters and outcome measures. Results: MIC- 1 was expressed in CRC tissue and the cancer cell line CaCo- 2. There was a progressive increase in serum MIC- 1 levels between normal individuals [mean (M) = 495 pg/ml, SD = 210), those with adenomatous polyps (M = 681 pg/ml, SD = 410), and those with CRC (M = 783 pg/ml, SD = 491) ]. Serum MIC- 1 level was correlated with the extent of disease so that the levels were higher in patients with higher Tumor-Node-Metastasis stage. There were significant differences in time to relapse and overall survival between subjects with different MIC- 1 levels <b>and</b> <b>genotypes.</b> Conclusions: This study identifies a strong association between MIC- 1 serum levels and neoplastic progression within the large bowel. We suggest that the measurement of serum MIC- 1 levels and determination of MIC- 1 genotype may have clinical use in the management of patients with CRC...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{clinical}} <b>and</b> <b>pathologic</b> {{features of}} hereditary dysphasic disinhibition dementia (HDDD) are described {{to determine whether}} it is a variant of known dementias. BACKGROUND: Several dementing disorders have clinical <b>and</b> <b>pathologic</b> similarities with AD, Pick's disease, and the "nonspecific" dementias. A detailed description of clinical <b>and</b> <b>pathologic</b> presentation will aid classification, but ultimately the discovery of causative gene(s) will define these disorders. METHODS: The authors performed a clinical assessment: gross <b>and</b> microscopic <b>pathologic</b> evaluation of brain tissue, genetic linkage studies, and sequence analyses. RESULTS: HDDD is an autosomal-dominant frontotemporal dementia with many similarities to Pick's disease. Salient clinical features are global dementia with disproportionate dysphasia and "frontotemporal" symptoms. A linkage between HDDD and 17 q 21 - 22 was shown, with a maximum lod score of 3. 68 at zero recombination. CONCLUSIONS: Several dementias have been linked to the same region and have been termed frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17. These disorders may represent phenotypic variants arising from mutations within a common gene...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Our {{purpose was}} to compare the ability of transvaginal Doppler ultrasonographic {{examination}} with that of gray-scale ultrasonographic examination to discriminate between benign and malignant and between normal <b>and</b> <b>pathologic</b> endometrium in women with postmenopausal bleeding. STUDY DESIGN: One hundred thirty-eight consecutive women scheduled for curettage because of postmenopausal bleeding underwent transvaginal ultrasonography, including color and spectral Doppler techniques, within 8 days preceding the operation. The thickness of the endometrium was measured. Doppler signals of the maximum blood flow velocity obtained from the two main uterine arteries and subendometrial and intraendometrial arteries were evaluated for pulsatility index and time-averaged maximum velocity. The results of the examinations were compared with the histologic diagnosis of the curettage specimen. RESULTS: Receiver-operator characteristic curves showed endometrial thickness {{to be a better}} discriminator between normal <b>and</b> <b>pathologic</b> <b>and</b> between benign and malignant endometrium than any Doppler variable, 14 mm being the optimal threshold value for differentiating between benign and malignant endometrium (sensitivity 88 %, specificity 81 %).

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{determine}} if staging of {{renal cell carcinoma}} (RCC) can be predicted from preoperative triphasic helical computed tomography (CT) findings. Patients and methodsWe reviewed the triphasic helical CT scans of 48 consecutive patients with pathologic diagnosis RCCs. All tumors were staged according to the 2002 version of TNM staging system. The preoperative radiologic staging was compared with postoperative pathologic staging. Agreement between the two staging systems was determined using the kappa test. ResultsComparison between triphasic helical CT staging <b>and</b> <b>pathologic</b> staging showed harmony in all lesions in stage T 1 a, and T 1 b. Triphasic helical CT over diagnosed two cases of stage T 1 b regarded as stage T 3 a while agreement was noted in all cases of stage T 2. Harmony was noted between triphasic helical CT <b>and</b> <b>pathologic</b> staging in two lesions stage T 3 a, four lesions in stage T 3 b, and two lesions stage T 4. The agreement between triphasic helical CT <b>and</b> <b>pathologic</b> T stages was perfect (K= 0. 941). Forty-two cases were staged N 0, one case was N 1, and five cases were staged N 2 by triphasic CT. Three cases were over staged, and six cases were under staged while, 39 were correctly N staged.

This study was conducted to assess the agreement between clinical diagnoses <b>and</b> <b>pathologic</b> reports in soft tissue lesions of patients referring to pathology department of dental school, Tehran and shahid Beheshti university of medical sciences during 2005 - 2008. Methods: In this retrospective and descriptive study, 300 soft tissue lesions of patients referring to pathology department were selected by census sampling method and then were analyzed. The lesions were classified according to the criteria proposed by reference pathology textbooks and the data records regarding the patients age, gender <b>and</b> clinical <b>and</b> <b>pathologic</b> diagnoses were noted.
