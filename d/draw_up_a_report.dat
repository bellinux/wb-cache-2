We were all standing, you must know, {{at the open}} door, taking a squint at the weather, when our attention was attracted by a curious object {{that appeared in the}} sky, and seemed to be coming down at the rate of ten knots an hour, right end-on for the house. I had just time to cry, `Clear out, lads,' when it came slap in through the doorway, and smashed to shivers there, where you see the fragments. In fact, it's a wonderful aerolite, and Mr Rogan has just gone out {{with a lot of the}} bits in his pocket, to make a careful examination of them, and <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> for the Geological Society in London.

I shall speak very strongly of your services during the past week, and it is always a good thing for an officer selected to carry the news of a success; and lastly, you can give a much better account of our operations, since we crossed the frontier, than an orderly could do, and Wellington may want to send orders back for our future work." ...|$|E

That person will be the bishop who has presented his resignation or, if the see is vacant, the diocesan administrator or apostolic administrator.

He may also consult others, whether clergy, diocesan or religious, and [...] "lay persons of outstanding wisdom".|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} at Burgos. He was {{admitted}} a Jesuit in 1612, and afterwards sent on mission work to Chile and Peru, where he became rector {{of the college of}} Cuenca. In 1639 he accompanied Pedro Teixeira in his second exploration of the Amazon, in order to take scientific observations, and <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> for the Spanish government. The journey lasted ten months; and on the explorer's arrival in Belém, Acuña prepared his narrative, while awaiting a ship for Europe. The king of Spain, Philip IV, received the author coldly, and, it is said even tried to suppress his book, fearing that the Portuguese, who had just revolted from Spain (1640), would profit by its information. After occupying the positions of procurator of the Jesuits at Rome and censor (calificador) of the Spanish Inquisition at Madrid, Acuña returned to South America, where he died, probably soon after 1675. His Nuevo Descubrimiento del Gran Río de las Amazonas was published at Madrid in 1641; French and English translations (the latter from the French), appeared in 1682 and 1698.|$|E

50|$|The {{return of}} Dutch rule reignited {{conflict}} between the planters of Essequibo and Demerara and the Dutch West India Company. Disturbed by plans {{for an increase in}} the slave tax and a reduction in their representation on the colony's judicial and policy councils, the colonists petitioned the Dutch government to consider their grievances. In response, a special committee was appointed, which proceeded to <b>draw</b> <b>up</b> <b>a</b> <b>report</b> called the Concept Plan of Redress. This document called for far-reaching constitutional reforms and later became the basis of the British governmental structure. The plan proposed a decision-making body {{to be known as the}} Court of Policy. The judiciary was to consist of two courts of justice, one serving Demerara and the other Essequibo. The membership of the Court of Policy and of the courts of justice would consist of company officials and planters who owned more than twenty-five slaves. The Dutch commission that was assigned the responsibility of implementing this new system of government returned to the Netherlands with extremely unfavorable reports concerning the Dutch West India Company's administration. The company's charter therefore was allowed to expire in 1792 and the Concept Plan of Redress was put into effect in Demerara and Essequibo. Renamed the United Colony of Demerara and Essequibo, the area then came under the direct control of the Dutch government. Berbice maintained its status as a separate colony.|$|E

These instructions, confirmed by Boisdeffre, seemed absurd to Picquart, since the bordereau established an indissoluble bond between the two cases; he should have understood from that moment that his superiors had determined not to permit the reopening of the Dreyfus affair.|$|R
