500|$|Blassingame {{concludes that}} there were a variety of {{personality}} types exhibited by slaves positioned on a scale between the two extremes of Sambo and Nat. He argues that variations present in plantations, overseers, and masters gave the slave [...] "much more freedom from restraint and more independence and autonomy than his institutionally defined role allowed. Consequently, the slave {{did not have to be}} infantile or abjectly docile in order to remain alive." [...] Blassingame compares slavery on southern plantations to the treatment of prisoners in Nazi concentration camps in an effort to demonstrate that [...] "the most important factor in causing <b>infantilism,</b> total dependency, and docility in the camps was the real threat of death which left few, if any, alternatives for the inmates." [...] He remarks, [...] "Placed on a continuum of total institutions, the concentration camp is far removed from the Southern plantation." [...] According to Blassingame, the goal of the irrationally organized and understaffed plantation was not the systematic torture and extermination of its laborers, who were [...] "worth more than a bullet".|$|E

2500|$|Bela Grunberger and Janine Chasseguet-Smirgel {{were two}} psychoanalysts from the Paris {{section of the}} International Psychoanalytical Association. In November 1968 they {{disguised}} themselves under the pseudonym André Stéphane and published L’univers Contestationnaire, in which they argued that the left-wing rioters of May 68 were totalitarian stalinists, and proceeded to psychoanalyze them as suffering from a sordid <b>infantilism</b> caught up in an Oedipal revolt against the Father. Jacques Lacan regarded Grunberger and Chasseguet-Smirgel's book with great disdain; {{while they were still}} disguised under the pseudonym, Lacan remarked that he was certain that neither author belonged to his school, as none would abase themselves to such low drivel. The IPa analysts responded with an accusation against the Lacan school of [...] "intellectual terrorism." [...] Gérard Mendel published La révolte contre le père (1968) and Pour décoloniser l’enfant (1971).|$|E
2500|$|However, {{alongside}} such {{a positive}} trajectory of diminishing individual egotism, a rather different arc of development can be noted in cultural terms, linked {{to what has}} been seen as the increasing <b>infantilism</b> of (post)modern society. Whereas in the nineteenth century egotism was still widely regarded as a traditional vice – for Nathaniel Hawthorne egotism was a sort of diseased self-contemplation – Romanticism had already set in motion a countervailing current, what Richard Eldridge described as a kind of [...] "cultural egotism, substituting the individual imagination for vanishing social tradition". The romantic idea of the self-creating individual – of a self-authorizing, artistic egotism – then took on broader social dimensions in the following century. Keats might still attack Wordsworth for the regressive nature of his retreat into the egotistical sublime; but by the close of the twentieth century egotism had been naturalized much more widely by the Me generation into the Culture of Narcissism.|$|E
2500|$|Gaining an Experimental Arts Grant {{from the}} {{publicly}} funded Yorkshire Arts Association, COUM {{described themselves as}} performance artists, being inspired by the Dadaists and emphasising the amateur quality of their work. They entered the National Rock/Folk Contest at Hull's New Grange Club with a set titled This Machine Kills Music, and organised events for Hull City Council's celebrations to mark the UK's entry into the European Economic Community in 1973. P-Orridge had also worked on solo projects, generating controversy in the local press over a conceptual artwork the artist entered at a local exhibition. Taking an increasing interest in <b>infantilism,</b> P-Orridge founded the fictitious L'ecole de l'art infantile and co-organised the [...] "Baby's Coumpetition" [...] at Oxford University's 1973 May Festival, also producing material as the fictitious Ministry of Antisocial Insecurity, a parody of the Ministry of Social Security. Meanwhile, P-Orridge created the character of Alien Brain, and in July 1972 performed the World Premiere of The Alien Brain at Hull Arts Centre. COUM also began publishing books; in 1972, they brought out {{the first volume of}} The Million and One Names of COUM, part of a proposed project to release 1001 slogans (such as [...] "A thousand and one ways to COUM" [...] and [...] "COUM are Fab and Kinky"), while in 1973 P-Orridge published Copyright Breeches, which explored an ongoing personal fascination with the copyright symbol and its implications for art and society.|$|E
5000|$|Confusing <b>infantilism</b> with pedophilia is {{a common}} {{misunderstanding}} but <b>infantilism</b> involves role-playing exclusively with other adults; <b>infantilism</b> {{is not related to}} pedophilia, or any form of child sexual abuse.

5000|$|Terms such as [...] "genital infantilism" [...] (<b>infantilism</b> in {{development}} of genitals, hypogenitalism), or [...] "sexual infantilism" [...] (lack of sexual development after expected puberty or delayed puberty) {{may still be}} seen, and {{are considered to be}} synonyms of hypogonadism. [...] "Somatic infantilism" [...] refers to <b>infantilism</b> of overall bodily development. Speech <b>infantilism</b> is a speech disorder.|$|E
5000|$|Psychologists D. Richard Laws and William O'Donohue {{state that}} [...] "Although <b>infantilism</b> is {{classified}} as a sexual masochism in the DSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR, it is questionable whether the criteria for sexual masochism are always met. For example, if the infantile role playing does not involve feelings of humiliation and suffering, then the diagnosis of sexual masochism would not be appropriate and a diagnosis of <b>infantilism</b> as a paraphilia otherwise specified is warranted." [...] Sexologist John Money, in his book Lovemaps describes paraphilic <b>infantilism</b> as a possible [...] "...adjunctive to masochistic discipline and humiliation." [...] Sexologist William B. Arndt considers paraphilic <b>infantilism</b> to combine forms of fetishism, tranvestism and masochism. [...] Wilhelm Stekel considered sado-masochistic practices to be variant behavior arising from psychosexual <b>infantilism.</b>|$|E

50|$|An {{additional}} {{theory is}} that <b>infantilism</b> is an erotic identity disorder where the erotic fantasy is centered on the self rather than on a sexual partner and results from an erotic targeting location error where the erotic target was children yet becomes inverted.

5000|$|Various {{types of}} <b>infantilism</b> were recognized, lumped {{together}} in the above superficial description. With {{better understanding of the}} endocrine system and genetic disorders, various disorders which included the word [...] "infantilism" [...] received other names. For example, Brissaud's <b>infantilism,</b> described by Édouard Brissaud in 1907 is now known as myxedema (a form of hypothyroidism); [...] "intestinal infantilism" [...] of Christian Archibald Herter is called coeliac disease. The Turner syndrome was described as [...] "a syndrome of infantilism" [...] by Henry Turner himself.|$|E
5000|$|There is no {{recognized}} etiology for <b>infantilism</b> {{and little}} {{research on the}} subject. It {{has been linked to}} masochism {{and a variety of other}} paraphilias. Though commonly confused with pedophilia, the two conditions are distinct and infantilists do not seek children as sexual partners. [...] A variety of causes has been proposed, including altered lovemaps, imprinting gone awry and errors in erotic targets, though there is no consensus. A variety of organizations exist to promote <b>infantilism</b> or meet with other practitioners throughout the world.|$|E

5000|$|Rud {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} [...] "Rud's syndrome") is a poorly characterized disorder, probably of recessive inheritance, that includes epilepsy, mental retardation, <b>infantilism,</b> congenital ichthyosis, and retinitis pigmentosa.|$|E
5000|$|The {{conventional}} {{definition of}} <b>infantilism</b> means {{the persistence of}} childlike traits in adults and medically the failure to attain sexual maturity, and [...] "sexual infantilism" [...] is also used medically as a synonym for delayed puberty. [...] The term [...] "psychosexual infantilism" [...] was used in Sigmund Freud's theory of psychosexual development to refer to individuals who had not matured through its hypothetical stages into heterosexuality. [...] Psychologist Wilhelm Stekel used [...] "psychosexual infantilism" [...] as a category similar to paraphilia, including paraphilic <b>infantilism</b> and other paraphilias and sexual orientations.|$|E
5000|$|To date no broad-based {{scientific}} {{studies have been}} made on the cause, incidence and general impact of paraphilic <b>infantilism</b> on society at large. This {{may be due to}} both the relative rarity of the condition and because few paraphilic infantilists appear to seek professional mental health counseling, and that even fewer appear to require any type of pro-active mental health intervention. [...] A 2002 case report by psychiatrists Jennifer Pate and Glen Goddard found little research on the topic, and they suggested the DSM lacked a category that captured their patient's disorder. [...] Research on the etiology of paraphilias in general is minimal and as of 2008 had essentially come to a standstill; {{it is not clear whether}} the development of <b>infantilism</b> shares a common cause with other paraphilias. Criminologists Stephen and Ronald Holmes believe that while there is no simple answer to the origins of <b>infantilism,</b> the practices may involve an element of stress reduction similar to that of transvestism.|$|E
50|$|Another common {{practice}} in feminization is orgasm control, often {{through the use of}} a chastity belt. Also encountered in feminization are the following: erotic humiliation, bondage, petticoating, cuckoldry, leather, latex/pvc, <b>infantilism,</b> corporal punishment, etc.|$|E
5000|$|Often, {{there are}} {{specific}} themes for said petticoating. Often, petticoating {{revolves around the}} [...] "little girl" [...] aspect in which the submissive/child is forced {{to act like a}} little girl. Other scenarios include <b>Infantilism</b> and Sissy Maid.|$|E
50|$|In medicine, <b>Infantilism</b> is an {{obsolete}} {{term for}} various, often unrelated disorders of human development, up to developmental disability, which consist of retention {{of the physical}} and/or psychological characteristics of early developmental stages (infant, child) into a relatively advanced age.|$|E

50|$|John Money {{distinguishes between}} <b>infantilism</b> or autonepiophilia and paraphilic diaper-wearing, {{stating that the}} latter is a paraphilic fetish that manifests as an erotic {{attraction}} to an article of clothing while the former is a non-fetishistic paraphilia directed at a change of status in terms of age identity.|$|E
