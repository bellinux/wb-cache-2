5|$|Along {{with other}} veterans' organisations, HIAG campaigned for the {{immediate}} amnesty and early release of war criminals still in Allied captivity. This issue was significant, as most of these organisations made their cooperation {{in the area of}} rearmament contingent on the satisfactory resolution in this area. It was partly for this reason that the West German government was sympathetic to the fate of these individuals and made every effort to secure their early release. Chancellor Adenauer <b>even</b> <b>met</b> with Kurt Meyer in Werl Prison when he went there on an inspection tour.|$|E
5|$|In 951, the Later Zhou emerged, {{the last}} of the five {{short-lived}} dynasties making up the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. The founding emperor of the Later Zhou died in 954 and was succeeded by his adopted son, who would rule with the name Emperor Shizong of Later Zhou. Shizong believed that the Liao dynasty was poised to invade the Zhou, and in 958 he launched a preemptive military campaign against the Liao, aiming to take the sixteen prefectures ceded to the Liao by Emperor Gaozu of Later Jin in 938. Emperor Shizong died in 959, before his army had <b>even</b> <b>met</b> the Liao forces. In 960 the commander-in-chief of the Later Zhou palace guard, Zhao Kuangyin, usurped the throne, then occupied by Emperor Shizong's seven-year-old son, and proclaimed himself the founder of the Song dynasty.|$|E
25|$|Rickover {{found himself}} {{frequently}} and loudly in bureaucratic combat with these senior naval officers, {{to the point}} that he almost missed becoming an admiral: two selection boards passed over Captain Rickover for promotion. One of these selection boards <b>even</b> <b>met</b> the day after USS Nautilus had its keel-laying ceremony in the presence of President Truman — and indicative of the Navy's attitude toward the ship's creator, Rickover had not been originally invited and was only eventually invited by way of his AEC role, not his Navy role. It eventually took the intervention of the White House, U.S. Congress, and the Secretary of the Navy— and the very real threat of changing the Navy's admiral-selection system to include civilians— before the next flag-selection board welcomed the twice passed-over Rickover (normally a career-ending event) into their ranks.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Dutch embassy diplomat Herman Knippenberg was {{investigating}} {{the murders of}} Bintanja and Hemker. Knippenberg had some knowledge of, and had possibly <b>even</b> <b>met</b> Sobhraj, although the latter's true identity was still unknown to the diplomat, who continued gathering evidence. With {{the help of a}} neighbour of Sobhraj, Knippenberg built a case against him. Knippenberg was eventually given police permission to search Sobhraj's apartment, a full month after the suspect had left the country. Knippenberg found evidence, including victims' documents and passports, as well as poisons and syringes. The trio's next stop was Malaysia, where Chowdhury was sent to steal gems. Chowdhury was observed delivering the gems to Sobhraj. This was the last time he was ever seen, and neither Chowdhury nor his remains were ever found. It is believed that Sobhraj murdered his former accomplice before leaving Malaysia to continue his and Leclerc's roles as gem salesmen in Geneva. A source later claimed to have sighted Chowdhury in Germany, the claim appeared unsubstantiated. The search for Chowdhury continues.|$|E

500|$|Medows' {{campaign}} in 1790 was a limited success. [...] He occupied the Coimbatore district against minimal opposition, but a forceful counterattack by Tipu reduced the British holdings to Coimbatore itself {{and a few}} other outposts. [...] Tipu had also descended to the coastal plain, where he plowed through the Carnatic and <b>even</b> <b>met</b> with the French at Pondicherry in a fruitless attempt to draw them into the conflict. By September 1790 the British allies were taking the field, but still did not want to face Tipu's strong force without significant British support. [...] Consequently, Cornwallis decided to personally take control of the main British force from Medows. [...] In early February 1791 he began a campaign that was squarely targeted at Mysore's capital, Seringapatam.|$|E
500|$|In {{his early}} years, Sorabji took an active {{interest}} in the occult—according to Rapoport, he was a mystic—and many of his early works contain occult inscriptions. For a time, {{he was a member}} of the London Society of Psychical Research. So interested was he in occultism that he <b>even</b> <b>met</b> Aleister Crowley in 1922, an event that Sorabji found disappointing and caused him to describe Crowley as [...] "the dullest of dull dogs". His occult interests also led to his friendship with Bernard Bromage (1899–1957), an English writer on mysticism and a member of the secret order of the Fraternity of Inner Light. Bromage was one of Sorabji's closest friends for 20 years, acting as joint trustee of the Shapurji Sorabji Trust between 1933 and 1941 and producing an index to Sorabji's book Around Music. Their relationship ended abruptly in 1942.|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between Mac and Sonny, whose name derives from [...] "son", {{is central to}} the film's exploration of the father–child theme. Sonny tries to conjure an image of his biological father, whom he never had the chance to know, through old photographs, his mother's memories and visits to his father's grave. Sonny finds a father figure in Mac—when another young boy asks Sonny if he likes Mac more than his real father, Sonny says that he does, because he never knew the other man; Briley says that this [...] "emphasizes the distinction between companionship and blood relationship Foote has pointed out before." [...] The final scene, in which Mac and Sonny play catch with a football Mac bought him as a gift, symbolizes the fact that although Mac has lost the chance to reconcile with his daughter, he now has a second chance at establishing a father–child relationship with Sonny. The father–child theme also plays out through Mac's relationship with the young band members, who say that he has been an inspiration to them, playing a paternal role in their lives before they <b>even</b> <b>met</b> him. Sledge eventually teams up with the musicians, offering them fatherly counsel in a much more direct way.|$|E

500|$|... "The {{appropriately}} named Cauldron," [...] says Binda, [...] "was to be {{the crucible}} in which the fighting character of the RLI was to be forged. ... It revealed to the world what outstanding and peerless anti-terrorist fighters the RLI were." [...] A Joint Operations Centre (JOC) was formed on 16 March 1968 at Karoi, made up of two RAR platoons, a BSAP patrol and 1 and 3 Commandos, RLI. Two Vampire fighter-bombers and two Canberra bombers were detailed to circle the area and provide air strikes as needed; {{the mere presence of}} these aircraft demoralised many cadres into deserting before they <b>even</b> <b>met</b> the Rhodesian forces. A patrol of 13 troopers from 14 Troop, 3 Commando, led by Lieutenant Bert Sachse, made first contact with the enemy on the morning of 18 March, encountering 14 nationalists near the Angwa River in the Mana Pools area. Attacking an enemy on higher ground, Sachse's men killed 10 guerrillas but lost Trooper E. N. F. Ridge to sniper fire. He was first RLI soldier to be killed by enemy action. Nevertheless, the official operational report describes the contact as [...] "a first-rate action in which Lieutenant Sachse's leadership and the determination of his men achieved an extremely successful result." ...|$|E
500|$|The second {{episode of}} the series, , was {{released}} in 2004. Mitsuda {{did not return to}} compose the soundtrack; instead, Yuki Kajiura and Shinji Hosoe were brought into the project. Kajiura had previously composed for a few video games as well as numerous anime soundtracks. Her style for the game's soundtrack, for which she composed only the numerous cinematic scenes, has been described as [...] "a fusion of electronica and techno with either an orchestra or ethnic instruments," [...] as well as including vocals in places where many composers would have left an instrumental section. Hosoe composed the music for the playable portions of the game, and feels that the sound quality and balance of the soundtrack is poor. This feeling is based primarily on the fact that he [...] "slashed the orchestral sound while creating the music" [...] so that the music played using the PlayStation 2's sound chip would match the music played off of the CD. He had predicted {{that there would be a}} fan outcry against [...] "changing composers on a series like Xenosaga", and suspects that his music from the game will never be released on an album; to date the released albums for the game include only Kajiura's work. Kajiura and Hosoe did not collaborate on any of the tracks in Episode II; according to Kajiura they never <b>even</b> <b>met</b> during the production.|$|E
500|$|Eastwood married Margaret Neville [...] "Maggie" [...] Johnson (born 1931; {{then working}} for an auto parts {{suppliers}} company) on December 19, 1953 in Pasadena. They had met {{six months earlier}} {{on a blind date}} in Los Angeles, although Eastwood subsequently had a serious relationship in Seattle that summer with a young woman who became pregnant with his child—an alleged daughter who was given up for adoption, per biographer Patrick McGilligan—before Johnson announced her engagement to him in October. The marriage would not prove altogether smooth. [...] "He thought they were too young, not well enough established," [...] remarked biographer Richard Schickel in the only authorized book ever written about Eastwood. A decade later, an ongoing affair Eastwood was involved in (said to have lasted 14 years) with dancer and Rawhide stuntwoman Roxanne Tunis (who was also married yet separated) produced his earliest verified child, daughter Kimber Eastwood (born Kimber Tunis; June 17, 1964), whose existence was kept secret from the public until July 1989, when the National Enquirer revealed her identity. Biographer Marc Eliot wrote of Johnson, [...] "It is difficult to say for sure that she actually knew about the baby, although it would have been nearly impossible for her not to. Everyone on the set knew ... and it is simply too difficult to keep a secret like that when the mother and the illegitimate child live in the same small town, especially when that small town is Hollywood." [...] The source for the 1989 Enquirer article that originally broke the story claimed Johnson was aware of Kimber's existence at all times and <b>even</b> <b>met</b> Roxanne Tunis in person when making an unannounced visit to the set of Breezy in 1972. Actress Barbara Eden, a onetime Rawhide guest star and witness to the affair with Tunis, said of Eastwood's relationship with Johnson: [...] "They conducted a somewhat open marriage." ...|$|E

The couple left the party in separate cars. After a light southern California rainstorm, Kovacs lost control of his Chevrolet Corvair station wagon while turning quickly, and crashed into a power pole at the corner of Beverly Glen and Santa Monica Boulevards. He was thrown halfway out the passenger side, and died almost instantly from chest and head injuries.|$|R

500|$|The {{trial began}} in June 1934 before Justice William Ives with {{three days of}} {{testimony}} from MacMillan. [...] Brownlee's lawyer, Arthur LeRoy Smith, used his cross examination {{to call into question}} almost everything MacMillan said. [...] To refute her claim that Brownlee had convinced her to move to Edmonton, he entered into evidence a letter she had written to Alberta College seeking information on its programs, dated before she had <b>even</b> <b>met</b> Brownlee. [...] He further demonstrated that on the evening of the seduction, which had allegedly taken place in a car on a side road west of Edmonton, the city had been engulfed in a blizzard. [...] Moreover, the government car in which the seduction was supposed to have taken place had not been purchased until {{more than a year after}} that date. [...] In response to her testimony that she had always slept in the maid's room while staying with the Brownlees, Smith produced letters showing that she had actually slept in Mrs. Brownlee's room. [...] After MacMillan conceded her mistake, Smith noted that Mrs. Brownlee's room had a large deadbolt on the door: if she had feared Brownlee, why had she not used it? [...] "Because I just did as Mr. Brownlee said," [...] was the plaintiff's response. [...] MacMillan, when questioned, admitted that the period during which she had been staying in the Brownlee home in the spring of 1932, which she had initially placed at six weeks, was actually only four. [...] When she identified these four weeks as the last two weeks of April and the first two of May, Smith showed that Brownlee had been out of town for all but ten nights of that period.|$|E

Thus began a comradeship which outlasted World War II. [...] On 6 March 92 Squadron Spitfires provided cover for 1 SAAF Squadron. They were supported by 601. Bär spotted their approach and climbed then dived onto the British.
