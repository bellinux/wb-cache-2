In September it moved to Baggush where on occasion it worked alongside tanks in training exercises.

5|$|D'Avalos, having {{waited for}} the arrival {{a large body of}} landsknechts {{dispatched}} by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, set off from Asti towards Carignano. His total force included 12,500–18,000 infantry, of which perhaps 4,000 were arquebusiers or musketeers; he was only able to gather about 800–1,000 cavalry, of which less than 200 were gendarmes. D'Avalos recognized the relative weakness of his cavalry, but considered it to be compensated by the experience of his infantry and the large number of arquebusiers in <b>its</b> <b>ranks.</b>|$|E

5|$|Opposing the US 24th Infantry at Battle Mountain was the NK 6th Division, {{which had}} been {{engaging}} Task Force Kean since August 5. The division, which had originally numbered 10,000, had suffered 4,000 casualties thus far fighting at the Pusan Perimeter. However it brought in 3,100 South Koreans forcibly conscripted from neighboring towns to replenish <b>its</b> <b>ranks.</b> The South Koreans fought as ordered, though the North Koreans dispatched rearguard soldiers with them to shoot any who attempted to desert, defect, or surrender.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1872, Rainilaiarivony {{worked to}} {{modernize}} the army {{with the assistance of}} a British military instructor, who was hired to recruit, train and manage its soldiers. Rainilaiarivony purchased new local and imported firearms, reintroduced regular exercises and reorganized the ranking system. He prohibited the purchasing of rank promotions or exemptions from military service and instituted free medical care for soldiers in 1876. The following year Rainilaiarivony introduced the mandatory conscription of 5,000 Malagasy from each of the island's six provinces to serve five years in the royal army, swelling <b>its</b> <b>ranks</b> to over 30,000 soldiers.|$|E

5|$|During the Bush War, the Rhodesian Army {{augmented}} <b>its</b> <b>ranks</b> {{with foreign}} volunteers, who were accepted into regular regiments {{with the same}} pay and conditions of service as locals. Most foreign recruits enlisted in the Rhodesian Light Infantry (RLI), which launched an overseas recruitment programme in 1974, but required successful applicants to speak good English. The Army attempted to alleviate the strain on its troops during late 1977 by recruiting French-speakers as well, and formed a designated company in the Rhodesia Regiment for them. The regiment already had six independent companies, so the Francophone unit became 7 Independent Company.|$|E
5|$|In January 1945, {{elements}} of the Corps participated in the German capture of Travnik, part of Operation Lawine. Afterwards, they withdrew to Slovenia. On 30 April, Shteifon was killed while passing through Zagreb. Colonel Anatoly Rogozhin then took over as commander. On 12 May, Rogozhin surrendered to the British near Klagenfurt. Members of the Corps were allowed to resettle in the West once hostilities had ceased. At the time of surrender, the Corps consisted of 3,500 men, according to Vertepov. Timofejev writes that the Corps consisted of 5,584 men {{by the end of}} the war. Between 1941 and 1945, 6,709 of its members were killed, wounded or went missing.

This diverse group established Societatea Ileana, an association dedicated to supporting innovative artists. Its steering committee was later joined by the intellectual and political figures Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, Nicolae Xenopol, and Nicolae Filipescu, {{as well as by}} the painter Jean Alexandru Steriadi. The society took up the effort to uproot against academic salons, organizing a large and provocative exhibit in 1898, and, at the height of its popularity, enlisted in <b>its</b> <b>ranks</b> some 300 people.

5|$|The Special Air Service (SAS) {{commando}} {{unit was}} formed by the British Army in 1941, during the North African Campaign of the Second World War.

It was disbanded by the British government in October 1945, and reinstituted in 1950 to serve in the Korean War. The situation in Korea had changed by the end of its three-month training period, however, and it was sent to Malaya instead. There it was placed under the command of a British officer, Major Mike Calvert.|$|E
