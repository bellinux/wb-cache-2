As part of the curriculum designed for an actor getting into character, I try to imagine what’s going to really help bring this actor more fully into character.

40|$|Beeswax {{candles and}} creams Cue: Livestock such as cattle provide {{a wide range}} of products: meat, milk, hides, manure and labour. Bees may be a much smaller animal, but they also provide an {{impressive}} range of products. The most obvious is honey, but there are several others, including beeswax and Royal Jelly. Bees produce the beeswax in order to construct the honeycomb. Once a bee-keeper has extracted the honey from the comb, this can be melted into a lump of wax, which has many potential uses. As such, beeswax may be a useful source of extra income for bee-keepers. In The Gambia the National Beekeepers? Association {{is at the heart of}} the country?s bee-keeping activities. Beekeepers bring their honey and other bee products to the Association for them to be sold, or used in making value added products. Ismaila Senghore recently visited the Association?s headquarters, located on a busy road in the capital Banjul, to find out more about the value of these bee by-products. IN:		?I am right here at the National ? OUT:		?to you. Thank you very much. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 37 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: And that was Ismaila Senghore reporting from Banjul in The Gambia. The interview comes from a radio resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Senghore	I am right here at the National Beekeepers? Association of The Gambia, right in their warehouse where they have the activities of processing of honey going on. And of course we have other by-products also from honey production, that is the wax, like candles, body creams and a lot more. But I have with me here Mr Ebrima Sanyang who is the processing officer of the National Beekeepers? Association of The Gambia. Mr Sanyang is going to tell me exactly how they manage to get the wax in the first place, and what they make out of this wax as by-products which are also meant for the market. Sanyang	Thank you Mr Senghore I am here to give you the view points of the by-products that we have in office here. After extracting out of the honey you put it in a container whereby you can melt it and then produce the wax alone with the bad elements out of it. Then from there you reprocess it again for it to be more clean than before, refining it with coke which will make it cleaner than before. Then you can start to make what you are going to make out of it. Senghore	Now what are the kinds of commodities that you get out of the wax in that form? Sanyang	You can make candles, body cream, wood polish, soap, cosmetics possibly. Senghore	Alright now let?s say if you look at the products that you make, like the ones on display here, the body creams, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> making the body cream for example? Can you explain briefly? Sanyang	Yes ok making body cream you have a certain measurement of the products you are going to use. For the wax itself there is a measurement which is one tea cup full of wax and then you can buy your oil, this vegetable oil, two cups measured in it, put it in the wax, melt it with other products like mentholator or this Karit‚ cream, you add there too to make it soft. Senghore	Ok now let?s talk about the candles, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> making the candles? Sanyang	You are going to break the wax into pieces or into particles, whereby you melt it. And then the other chemical you are going to put inside for it to absorb fire easily is paraffin, which is not available in time. But what we do is we buy these candles from the shops, break it into pieces, melt it together with the wax so that the paraffin inside that candle can be mixed up with the wax to absorb fire easily. Senghore	Now do you make enough for the market, in other words is the demand very high? Sanyang	Well the demand is not so high because we Africans we are not adopting this type of system of candles. But let?s say the whites who always come, sometimes they make a lot of demand, whereby I make it for them, then sell it to them for their own use. Senghore	Finally Mr Sanyang would you say this kind of activity, processing of commodities from wax honey by-products, can be something that can be sustainable amongst your members, like for example they can go and do it on their own even if you are not around? Sanyang	Yes, some of them they do make it because when I am away, sometimes I meet up with others who are making it, and then some comes to my centre to buy wax for making body creams and the likes. Senghore	Therefore what advice would you give to anybody who is planning to go into the processing of such by-products? What kind of advice do you think will be useful to them so they will make successful enterprises like this? Sanyang	Yes, I thought that before you start on the process you have to find all your necessary equipments whereby your work will be easy without any other problem. Senghore	Thank you very much Mr Ebrima Sanyang. That was Mr Ebrima Sanyang talking to me about the processing of wax into commodities that are useable by the local markets and of course by tourists coming here in The Gambia. Mr Sanyang is the Processing Officer of the National Beekeeper?s Association of the Gambia. Mr Sanyang it has been a great pleasure talking to you. Thank you very much.

40|$|Fair trade {{marketing}} - an ethical edge CUE: Fair Trade is an innovation in marketing {{that has been}} particularly important for small-scale producers. Companies that follow ?Fair trade? principles give their products an ethical value by always paying producers a fair price for their goods. This has proved a successful marketing strategy as increasing numbers of consumers, particularly in wealthier countries, are choosing fair trade products, even when these are more expensive than other brands. But what about selling fair trade goods in Africa? Are local consumers ready {{to pay more for}} a fairly produced commodity? In this next report, Eric Kadenge talks to Farouk Jiwa of Honey Care Africa, a company that for two years has been developing small-scale bee-keeping in Kenya. Farouk explains why Honey Care decided to get into honey production, and how the company is trying to persuade Kenyans to pay more for its ethical honey. IN:		?We came into the market ? OUT:		? right across the country. DUR?N	 4 ? 57 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Farouk Jiwa of Honey Care Africa, on the importance of having a quality product for successful marketing. Transcript Jiwa	We came into the market primarily because we realised there was a vacuum that existed, the way bee-keeping was being done in Kenya, there was really no progress being made. We?ve developed something called the Langstroth beehive, and have found innovative mechanisms through which farmers can get access to these beehives quickly, under a credit facility or a loan facility through NGOs. Honey Care then provides training wherever possible, and most importantly, Honey Care provides a guaranteed market for the farmers. We go out to the farmers farms, we collect the honey on the spot, and the cash payments are made directly to the farmers on the day of collection of the honey. And that has been probably the most important incentive that Honey Care can provide towards the development of a bee-keeping sector in this country. Kadenge	And I?m curious to know what kind of people constitute your farmers, what is their economic status in Kenya for example? Jiwa	Our farmers tend to be smallholder farmers, with average plot size of between five acres to a quarter of an acre. They are almost about 43 % women now, because we have done a very important thing in terms of introducing bee-keeping to women. We have taken the hives off the trees, brought them down to eye-level, and ensured that women can get involved in bee-keeping as well. Kadenge	So once you have the honey from the farmer, what then do you do with it? Jiwa	We then bring the honey down to Nairobi where it is processed in our factory. We then work on pasteurising the honey, incubating the honey, and it is eventually bottled. The honey then goes out under the Honey Care Africa brand name. We have four different flavours of honey, depending on the area that the honey comes from. There is ?Highland Blend?, ?African Blossom?, ?Acacia? and ?Wild Comb? honey. These then go out into the market locally. They are supplied to most of the hotels, the airlines and various supermarkets as well. Kadenge	Now given that we have quite a number of other people that produce honey, {{what are some of the}} marketing strategies that you use to make sure that you have an edge over them? Jiwa	I think the most important thing we have been able to do is establish ourselves as being a Fair Trade organisation. We do practise fair trade all the way through, during the entire process chain of honey production, which begins from the manufacture of the beehives, right up to the marketing of the honey. We believe in paying a fair price, or a fair wage for whoever is involved in the entire process. If there is a jar of honey that has been produced by a private farmer at 150 shillings, and a jar of honey that has been produced by a community group or a women?s group in a particular area, selling at 200 shillings, we are trying to convince the Kenyan market that it is worthwhile moving more towards supporting community projects, and paying an extra premium. I think in addition to that it is a question of having a consistent quality, having a high quality product that is available throughout the year. If you don?t have a good product, no matter how you package it, it is not going to work. And I would say the third thing we have done as far as marketing is concerned is coming up with more innovative packaging. We?ve done a very good job on our labels, they are hand painted labels, they reflect the various vegetation and species of trees that we have in this country, and that adds to the exotic value of our honey in many ways as well. Kadenge	And given that you have to work with farmers that come from various parts of the country, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>about</b> meeting the transport requirement for that? Jiwa	The most important thing is you have to make the farmers organise in economically viable clusters, so it?s financially viable, economically viable to go out and collect the honey from a group of farmers rather than a scattered number of people. It is more to do with logistics and organisation in the field, that makes the transportation cost a lot easier to bear. Kadenge	And how much is the honey consumption in Kenya, and do you see this consumption increasing with time? Jiwa	The consumption is actually quite low for a country like Kenya, especially given the historical background of most of the communities, and the central role that honey has played in various communities and traditions, customs, marriage, initiation, and a whole bunch of other things as well. The main reason for the consumption to be as low as it has been, has been primarily because of the unavailability of high quality Kenyan honey which is of a regularised standard available consistently throughout the year. Consumption of honey primarily has been in its raw form, as honey only. There is a lot of potential for combining honey with other products for example as well. Whether it is going to be honey in cereals, honey in barbecue sauce, whatever it may be. There are a lot of combinations that have not been explored to their fullest, and I think the consumption will definitely increase in the next three to five years. Kadenge	So these are some of the marketing strategies that you intend to use in the coming years? Jiwa	More than anything else, the first platform of our marketing strategy would be to convince people that there is finally an option to the poor quality honey that they have normally seen out here in the market. There is finally a home-grown answer to probably one of the most important food products in terms of a social value and a historical value for our country. The idea would be to convince them that we do now have high quality honey that is available to them at affordable prices right across the country. End of track. Honey Care Africa is a company based in Kenya which in the last two years has won numerous awards for its development work with small-scale, rural beekeepers. The company?s marketing strategy has focussed on having a good quality, attractively labelled product, but it is also aware that being a ?Fair Trade? producer also helps to attract customers...|$|E
