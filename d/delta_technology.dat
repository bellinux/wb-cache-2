After our successful 15 th Anniversary symposium in IJmuiden and a year with other special activities, 2008 will be {{a year in which}} we will further work on the consolidation and expansion of our organisation. This year, new members will become part of the NCK community. For the first time this NCK symposium is now hosted by Deltares. This new research institute for <b>delta</b> <b>technology</b> unites the former NCK partners WL Delft Hydraulics, TNO Bouw en Ondergrond and RWS-RIKZ (together with GeoDelft). To mark this special occasion, the place of venue is Delft instead of our common sea-side resort. We are pleased again to offer you an attractive program that clearly demonstrates our NCK trademark. Well-known subjects related to sandy coasts, tidal inlets and estuaries will alternate with presentations on the transport and deposition of sand-mud mixtures, the interdisciplinary work within biogeomorphology and the development of shelf sea morphology...|$|E

Using the right UPS architectures in properly designed electrical installations and appropriate matching with the loads are the objectives to be achieved.

Harmonic {{voltage and current}} distortion are also significant UPS evaluation parameters. UPS selection is made among double conversion, line interactive, stand-by and <b>delta</b> conversion <b>technology.</b> The power quality provided by {{each one of the}} described UPS systems is related to harmonic distortion, inverter structure and voltage/frequency correction capability.

40|$|ZeroDB is an {{end-to-end}} encrypted {{database that}} enables clients {{to operate on}} (search, sort, query, and share) encrypted data without exposing encryption keys or cleartext data to the database server. The familiar client-server architecture is unchanged, but query logic and encryption keys are pushed client-side. Since the server has no insight {{into the nature of}} the data, the risk of data being exposed via a server-side data breach is eliminated. Even if the server is successfully infiltrated, adversaries would not have access to the cleartext data and cannot derive anything useful out of disk or RAM snapshots. ZeroDB provides end-to-end encryption while maintaining much of the functionality expected of a modern database, such as full-text search, sort, and range queries.

50|$|The Quarry still {{maintains}} {{the facade of}} the cement factory and its most notable feature and landmark is the four historical smokestacks that can be seen several miles from the Quarry. In 1998, Tramell Crow brought in structural restoration and preservation specialist <b>Delta</b> Structural <b>Technology,</b> Inc. to restore and preserve three of the four stacks. The structures are approximately 204 ft high, 18 ft diameter at the base, and 15 ft diameter at the top. These smokestacks had previously been retrofitted with steel bands every 20 ft from top to bottom, which had either rusted and fallen off or had relaxed providing little, if any structural confinement. The structural contractor utilized an exclusive retrofit technique which involved complete encapsulation of three of the four stacks using high performance structural composites saturated in an epoxy matrix. The installation took less than two months, and received multiple awards within the historical preservation and concrete construction industry.|$|R

40|$|Laboratory diagnostics, {{a pivotal}} part of {{clinical}} decision making, is no safer than {{other areas of}} health-care, with most errors occurring in the manually intensive preanalytical process.

While it is misleadingly assumed that identification errors occur at a low frequency in clinical laboratories, misidentification of general laboratory specimens is around 1 % and can produce serious harm to patients, when not promptly detected. This article focuses on this challenging issue, providing an overview on the prevalence and leading causes of identification errors, analyzing the potential adverse consequences, and providing tentative guidelines for detection and prevention based on direct-positive identification, the use of information technology for data entry, automated systems for patient identification and specimen labeling, two or more identifiers during sample collection and <b>delta</b> check <b>technology</b> to identify significant variance of results from historical values.
