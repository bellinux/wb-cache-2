5|$|Caesium-137, with a {{half-life}} of 30.17years, {{is one of}} the {{two principal}} medium-lived fission products, along with strontium-90, which are responsible for most of the radioactivity of spent nuclear fuel after several years of cooling, up to several hundred years after use. It constitutes most of the radioactivity still left from the Chernobyl accident. Caesium-137 undergoes high-energy beta decay and eventually becomes stable barium-137. It is a strong emitter of gamma radiation. Caesium-137 has a very low rate of neutron capture and cannot be feasibly disposed of in this way, but must be allowed to decay. Caesium-137 {{has been used as a}} tracer in <b>hydrologic</b> <b>studies,</b> analogous to the use of tritium. Small amounts of caesium-134 and caesium-137 were released into the environment during nearly all nuclear weapon tests and some nuclear accidents, most notably the Goiânia accident and the Chernobyl disaster. As of 2005, caesium-137 is the principal source of radiation in the zone of alienation around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. Its chemical properties as one of the alkali metals make it one of most problematic of the short-to-medium-lifetime fission products because it easily moves and spreads in nature due to the high water solubility of its salts, and is taken up by the body, which mistakes it for its essential congeners sodium and potassium.|$|E

50|$|Caesium-137 {{has been}} used in <b>hydrologic</b> <b>studies</b> {{analogous}} to those with tritium. As a daughter product of fission bomb testing from the 1950s through the mid-1980s, caesium-137 was released into the atmosphere, where it was absorbed readily into solution. Known year-to-year variation within that period allows correlation with soil and sediment layers. Caesium-134, {{and to a lesser extent}} caesium-135, have also been used in hydrology to measure the caesium output by the nuclear power industry. While they are less prevalent than either caesium-133 or caesium-137, these bellwether isotopes are produced solely from anthropogenic sources.|$|E

50|$|In some ways, 129I {{is similar}} to 36Cl. It is a soluble halogen, fairly non-reactive, exists mainly as a non-sorbing anion, and is {{produced}} by cosmogenic, thermonuclear, and in-situ reactions. In <b>hydrologic</b> <b>studies,</b> 129I concentrations are usually reported as the ratio of 129I to total I (which is virtually all 127I). As {{is the case with}} 36Cl/Cl, 129I/I ratios in nature are quite small, 10−14 to 10−10 (peak thermonuclear 129I/I during the 1960s and 1970s reached about 10−7). 129I differs from 36Cl in that its half-life is longer (15.7 vs. 0.301 million years), it is highly biophilic, and occurs in multiple ionic forms (commonly, I− and IO3−), which have different chemical behaviors. This makes it fairly easy for 129I to enter the biosphere as it becomes incorporated into vegetation, soil, milk, animal tissue, etc.|$|E

The <b>hydrologic</b> <b>studies</b> related to water balance and sedimentation was done using radioisotopes for estimating/measuring the various components of the inflow and outflow into the lake. Studies indicated that the subsurface inflow and outflow were significant - ranging from 43 to 63% and 41 to 54%, respectively, of the total inflow and outflow, except in years of exceptionally heavy rainfall. The components of outflows were the surface outflow, the subsurface outflow through the springs on the downstream side and draft through wells for meeting the water supply of Nainital town and evaporation loss from the lake surface. The mean water retention time for the lake was computed as 1.16 years for the mean annual rainfall.|$|E

50|$|The {{program is}} a {{generalized}} modeling system capable of representing many different watersheds. A model of the watershed is constructed by separating the water cycle into manageable pieces and constructing boundaries around the watershed of interest. Any mass or energy flux in the cycle can then be represented with a mathematical model. In most cases, several model choices are available for representing each flux. Each mathematical model included in the program is suitable in different environments and under different conditions.

40|$|Cultivation and {{drainage}} projects associated with livestock production have substantially disturbed resaca wetlands and wet prairie habitats in southern Texas. As {{a consequence of}} the anthropogenic disturbances, the area of these wetlands has been reduced and the ecological integrity of the remaining wetlands has been compromised. The goal {{of this study was to}} explore effective strategies for ecological restoration of coastal prairie and resaca ecosystems in south Texas and provide restoration recommendations to the National Park Service at Palo Alto Battlefield National Historic Site (NHS). Field experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of different approaches for restoring Spartina spartinae on disturbed saline flats. A resaca <b>hydrologic</b> <b>study</b> was initiated to evaluate the groundwater hydrology in disturbed versus undisturbed resaca wetlands and explore potential restoration strategies. Transplanting S. spartinae in the fall season was more successful (80 % survivability) than seeding (0 % initial establishment), spring transplanting (0 % survival), spring and fall mechanical transplanting (0 % and 6 % survivability, respectively). Soil disturbance significantly affected (p < 0. 05) survival of transplanted tillers and basal diameter of both the bare root and container-grown transplants in the fall manual treatments. The initial <b>hydrologic</b> <b>study</b> of the resaca wetlands found that vegetation rooting zone hydrology was likely dependent on surface water rather than groundwater. These findings suggest that strategies that restore surface hydrologic regimes will likely restore the ecosystem structure and function of disturbed resacas. Manually transplanting bare-root stock of S. spartinae in the late fall season without soil disturbance will increase the likelihood of successful saline flat restoration...|$|R

These frequent flood events raised the need for accurate estimates of surface runoff and possibly flooded areas in this region. Flooding is prevalent in this valley-coastal region due to the surrounding mountain stream network, which is characterized by flash floods from high precipitation amounts with high intensities between December and March. Most of the streams in this region have no hydraulic control structures at the outlets to regulate their flows. A <b>hydrologic</b> <b>study</b> was conducted at this urbanized valley-coastal area to identify the flood magnitudes and possible flooded areas using a number of geospatial, hydrologic and hydrodynamic models, namely GIS, HEC-SSP, Win-TR- 20 and FESWMS.

FESWMS simulations showed that the flooded area increases for the 500 -yr return period compared to the lower ones. The water depth ranges on average from 0. 5 to 8. 0 m.

This analysis consists of two major parts: (1) The freshwater streamflow that enters the estuary from the drainage basin; and (2) the mixing of that fresh I'/ater within the estuary. It should be noted that hydrologic data for the South Slough basin are made conspicuous by their absence. For this reason, data from nearby collection stations outside the basin have been used in the analyses made for South Slough. This has permitted an estimate of precipitation and runoff. But the results presented here can in no way take the place of the analysis of data collected in the drainage basin itself. Nor should these results, based on monthly averages of precipitation, be compared indiscriminately with measured daily values...|$|R
