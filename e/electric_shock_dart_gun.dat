Some of them were grim enough to produce the effect, if the mere grimness of the painting produced it--no such thing. My eye passed over them all with perfect indifference, but the moment it reverted to this visage over the fire-place, it was as if an <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> <b>darted</b> through me. The other pictures were dim and faded; but this one protruded from a plain black ground in the strongest relief, and with wonderful truth of coloring. The expression was that of agony--the agony of intense bodily pain; but a menace scowled upon the brow, and a few sprinklings of blood added to its ghastliness. Yet it was not all these characteristics--it was some horror of the mind, some inscrutable antipathy awakened by this picture, which harrowed up my feelings.|$|R

A novel chaotic detection of the <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> current and Lyapunov exponent is introduced in this paper. <b>Electric</b> <b>shock</b> current component is extracted according to the characteristics that chaotic system’s bifurcation action from chaotic state is sensitive to the weak signals and immune to noise. The largest Lyapunov exponent is proposed as the judgment criterion of phase transition of chaotic system. It can automatically recognize the critical state before and after <b>electric</b> <b>shock...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{microscopic}} nematode Caenorhabditis elegans {{has emerged}} as a valuable model for understanding the molecular and cellular basis of neurological disorders. The worm offers important physiological similarities to mammalian models such as conserved neuron morphology, ion channels, and neurotransmitters. While a wide-array of behavioral assays are available in C. elegans, an assay for electroshock/electroconvulsion remains absent. Here, we have developed a quantitative behavioral method to assess the locomotor response following <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> in C. elegans. <b>Electric</b> <b>shock</b> impairs normal locomotion, and induces paralysis and muscle twitching; after a brief recovery period, shocked animals resume normal locomotion. We tested <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> responses in loss-of-function mutants for unc- 25, which encodes the GABA biosynthetic enzyme GAD, and unc- 49, which encodes the GABAA receptor. unc- 25 and unc- 49 mutants have decreased inhibitory GABAergic transmission to muscles, and take significantly more time to recover normal locomotion following <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> compared to wild-type. Importantly, increased sensitivity of unc- 25 and unc- 49 mutants to <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> is rescued by treatment with antiepileptic drugs, such as retigabine. Additionally, we show that pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), a GABAA receptor antagonist and proconvulsant in mammalian and C. elegans seizure models, increases susceptibility of worms to <b>electric</b> <b>shock...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} association of neurodegenerative diseases and electric occupations and evaluates <b>electric</b> <b>shocks</b> and magnetic fields exposures. First, we conducted a meta-analysis of occupational electromagnetic fields (MF) and neurodegenerative diseases (NDD) to systematically explore methodological differences between studies. Second, we developed an <b>electric</b> <b>shocks</b> job exposure matrix (JEM) to characterize occupations exposed to <b>electric</b> <b>shocks.</b> Finally, we examined the association between occupational <b>electric</b> <b>shocks,</b> MF and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) mortality. We conducted a meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies on occupational MF exposure and NDD. We found weak associations of occupational MF exposures with both AD and MND, but not with Parkinson's disease, dementia, and multiple sclerosis. Risk of developing MND was associated with electric occupations, while AD risk was associated with estimated MF levels. Nonetheless, there is extensive result variation related to aspects of study design, with dissimilarity in this variation across diseases. Our results do not support MF as the explanation for the observed electric occupation and MND association. Misclassification of disease, particularly for AD, and imprecise exposure assessment affected most studies. To evaluate a consistent association between jobs in "electric" occupations and ALS, we developed a comprehensive JEM that includes <b>electric</b> <b>shocks</b> and MF. <b>Electric</b> <b>shocks</b> were based on two data sources along with expert judgment. Main occupational groups experiencing the <b>electric</b> <b>shocks</b> were precision production, craft and repair occupations. Specific jobs with high <b>electric</b> <b>shock</b> exposure were electrical apprentices, mechanic and repairer helpers, hoist and winch operators and electrical power installers. Examples of job titles with low electric-shock exposures were administrative support occupations, data-key entry operators, and waiters and waitresses. The relationship between occupational <b>electric</b> <b>shocks,</b> MF and ALS was investigated using cases identified in 1991 - 1999 U. S. mortality data. For each ALS death, 10 sex-, age-, year- and region-matched controls were selected. We linked the usual occupation reported on the death certificate to a JEM with <b>electric</b> <b>shocks</b> and MF. Increased odds ratios were observed for ALS among those in electric occupations (OR= 1. 23, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 04, 1. 47). For <b>electric</b> <b>shocks,</b> ALS mortality odds ratios were 0. 73 (95 % CI: 0. 67, 0. 79) for high exposure and 0. 90 (95 % CI: 0. 84, 0. 97) for medium exposure compared to low exposure. For MF, ALS mortality odds ratios were 1. 09 (95 % CI: 1. 00, 1. 19) for high exposure and 1. 09 (95 % CI: 0. 96, 1. 23) for medium exposure as compared to low. However, ALS mortality increased only in electric occupations with medium and low <b>electric</b> <b>shocks</b> exposures. Current results support an association between electric occupations and ALS, but provide no evidence that this association is explained by occupational exposure to <b>electric</b> <b>shocks</b> or MF...|$|R
