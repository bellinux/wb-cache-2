2500|$|While hosting The Late Late Show, Tubridy {{has often}} clashed {{with his own}} guests, {{including}} Gordon Ramsay ("a bit, em, British for my liking"), Louis Walsh (giving Jedward a [...] "hard time" [...] on The Late Late Toy Show), Sinéad O'Connor (the [...] "crazy performing monkey" [...] incident), former MEP Paul Murphy (whose guest appearance contrasted glaringly with Miriam O'Callaghan's Prime Time interview of Enda Kenny the previous night) and Mia Farrow ("What's {{the matter with you}} anyway? Jesus!"). In May 2011, a former director of television at RTÉ, Helen O'Rahilly, said of The Late Late Show: “If <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> charge of RTÉ, you wouldn't see this utter shite on Friday night”.|$|E
2500|$|... "Had it {{not been}} for the Tartars I would not be alive today. They were the nomads of the Crimea, in what was then no man's land between the Russian and German fronts, and favoured neither side. I had already struck up a good {{relationship}} with them, and often wandered off to sit with them. ‘Du nix njemcky’ they would say, ‘du Tartar,’ and try to persuade me to join their clan. Their nomadic ways attracted me of course, although by that time their movements had been restricted. Yet, it was they who discovered me in the snow after the crash, when the German search parties had given up. I was still unconscious then and only came round completely after twelve days or so, and by then <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> a German field hospital. So the memories I have of that time are images that penetrated my consciousness. The last thing I remember was that it was too late to jump, too late for the parachutes to open. That must have been a couple of seconds before hitting the ground. Luckily I was not strapped in – I always preferred free movement to safety belts… My friend was strapped in and he was atomized on impact – there was almost nothing to be found of him afterwards. But I must have shot through the windscreen as it flew back at the same speed as the plane hit the ground and that saved me, though I had bad skull and jaw injuries. Then the tail flipped over and I was completely buried in the snow. That's how the Tartars found me days later. I remember voices saying ‘Voda’ (Water), then the felt of their tents, and the dense pungent smell of cheese, fat and milk. They covered my body in fat to help it regenerate warmth, and wrapped it in felt as an insulator to keep warmth in." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea behind}} [...] "Rhythm of Love" [...] is, {{according}} to Rabin, [...] "just sex". By {{the time of}} the recording, he felt Yes had pushed away from the cosmic-inspired lyrics that the group were known for in the 1970s with [...] "Owner of a Lonely Heart", and thought a sex lyric would be a [...] "nice little tease". Anderson claimed the group were strong for its chorus, but he felt unsure and needed the lyrics [...] "fashioned" [...] and changed some words. [...] "Big Generator" [...] is one of the album's three tracks credited to the whole group. It developed from a riff by Squire and Rabin, originating from a specific tuning Squire had on his 5-string bass which helped to create the song, which involved contributions from White on the drums. In its early development, White felt the song needed some [...] "Yes stamps" [...] incorporated into the arrangement, and instructed the group to play a section and not listen to his playing. [...] "I just stopped and started ... like the drummer fell off his stool and then got back on trying to catch up the beat. Playing very slowly and then faster ... and then <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> time". Once he was, [...] "I reversed the beat around backwards so I came in with the bass drum on two and four instead of one and three". [...] "Shoot High Aim Low", the second group track, was one of the songs recorded in Carimate, and features reverb that was captured naturally around the castle's acoustics, rather than reverb added electronically in the studio. White came up with the chords while he was playing in the studio with the drum box. When Rabin arrived at the studio, he told White to continue playing the beat while he started singing a melody that was used in the song. It features Anderson as [...] "the guy in the helicopter going in at ninety miles an hour and I'm going to blow everybody up", yet has Rabin's backing vocals sing a love lyric that involves a couple enjoying their company in a car. He summarised the song's message as [...] "To live beyond war". Rabin later called the song his favourite on Big Generator. Rabin called [...] "Almost Like Love" [...] a track that did not quite work in the end and wished it was not included on the album. He disagreed {{with the addition of a}} horn section, comparing it to soul music and [...] "Sussudio" [...] by Phil Collins. Squire was particularly into the song's riff, yet Rabin felt the song around it was substandard, like [...] "polishing a vase while the building was falling down".|$|E

6000|$|... "These words," [...] he returned, [...] "will be {{a comfort}} {{to me when}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> London, after the {{peaceful}} days we have spent together." ...|$|R
5000|$|Seraphin once healed a dying bishop. The bishop told him, [...] "I made a {{long journey}} and was hoping to enter paradise. But, thanks to you, they shut the door {{in my face and}} threw me down the stairs, so here <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> this world." ...|$|R
60|$|After this I think I fainted, {{for when}} I came to myself again <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the cave.|$|E
60|$|I {{achieved}} a cat-like celerity. In another second <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> my fork reloading, my legs tucked up {{as tightly as}} possible.|$|E
60|$|When I spoke next, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the school-house, {{sitting there}} with my bonnet on my head, Gavin looking at me. We had {{forgotten}} the cannon at last.|$|E
60|$|DEARTH (with {{his sweet}} mournful smile). <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> a moment--probably.|$|R
6000|$|... "Really, Meekins," [...] he declared, [...] "I do {{not know}} when I have enjoyed any {{performance}} so much. I feel as if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> {{the days of the}} Roman gladiators. I can see that you mean to succeed. You will succeed. You do not mean to end your days amid objectionable surroundings." ...|$|R
6000|$|So the {{acquaintance}} became {{closer and}} closer, {{and at last}} Will ventured to say: “If <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> England, mademoiselle, <b>I</b> might perhaps get your Lucien out. You could give me his name and the prison {{in which he is}} confined, and it would <b>be</b> hard if <b>I</b> could not manage to aid him to escape.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At half-past eleven O'Connor {{asks me to}} take a short {{stroll through}} the streets to see if I could notice any signs of the uprising. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> fifteen minutes.|$|E
60|$|In {{less than}} three-quarters of an hour, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the club. I found my cousin almost alone in the smoking-room. He looked up with ill-suppressed eagerness as I entered.|$|E
6000|$|That night I dreamed <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> India with {{no place}} to sleep in; {{tramping}} up and down the Station mall and asking everybody, [...] "When shall I see you again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We shall {{look in on}} our way to the train," [...] {{answered}} Holmes. A {{moment later}} he and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the front room, where the impassive lady was still quietly working away at her antimacassar. She put it down on her lap as we entered and looked at us with her frank, searching blue eyes.|$|R
60|$|LADY CHILTERN. <b>I</b> will <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> a moment. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{only going}} to take my hat off.|$|R
60|$|And now the {{pleasant}} Twilight Land had gone. It had faded out, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> again <b>in</b> the work-a-day world.|$|R
60|$|On the 23d of March <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> Washington, {{and on the}} 26th took up my {{headquarters}} at Culpeper Court-House, a few {{miles south of the}} headquarters of the Army of the Potomac.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Mother, I know it. Only I can't think now. I'm new here. And {{handicapped}} by {{concern for}} you, for Lucy, for Dad.... Lord, if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the Cimarron--it'd be easy!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Oh, I wasn't {{thinking}} of them dudes and culls on the hoof,' says he. 'I was {{thinking of}} the time me and George put sheep-dip in Horsehead Johnson's whisky. I wish <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> Atascosa City,' says he.|$|E
2500|$|I don't {{think that}} the gossipy or {{official}} versions of what happened <b>are</b> right, but <b>I</b> feel definitely that if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the situation again as the person <b>I</b> <b>am</b> now, it wouldn't have happened. [...] Which means it's basically my fault. [...] I {{had a kind of}} insecurity and self-importance, which I didn't see for a long time, that was a bad dynamic in the community.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{in exile}} and now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> my country saying what I believe without hesitation. The {{best thing is}} we can organise in this space. It doesn't make me {{satisfied}} or content to say [...] "everything is okay", but it doesn't mean I can deny the positive changes that have been made. Redress {{needs to be made}} for the past and reforms need to be made concrete.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well;--yes. I {{could not}} do so last night, and <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> London either to-night or before you are up to-morrow morning." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> a few moments, {{and there}} stood my Charon {{fluttering}} {{in the cool}} air. One good push sent us to the islet I made haste to undress, for {{he was ready for}} the water, Trip dancing round, barking with excitement at his new appearance.|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{just one}} moment I wished <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the old Vallambrosa, {{starving}} and hoping. And then I got numb, and didn't care. And then I felt that somebody else was in the water close by me, holding me up. He had followed me, and jumped in to save me.|$|E
6000|$|He {{may be the}} Eighty-firsht, or th' Eighty-second; {{but what}} I say is, [...] without fear of contradiction, I wish to the Lord <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> old [...] Bristol again. I'd sooner have a nipperkin of our own real [...] "Bristol [...] milk" [...] than a mash-tub full of this barbarian wine! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{had neither}} pencil nor paper," [...] Monsieur Louis said, [...] "and the affair <b>was</b> urgent. <b>I</b> must <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> Norwich by eight o'clock." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why should I {{object to}} that? <b>I</b> shall not <b>be</b> jealous of Mr Fisker's attentions {{to the young}} lady. But it will suit me to have some one to whom I can speak on {{friendly}} terms when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> California. <b>I</b> may have a job {{of work to do}} there which will require the backing of some friends. <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> hand-and-glove with these people before I have travelled half across the ocean with them.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said briefly, [...] "tastes differ. I've seen quite all I want to of Paris for {{the rest}} of my life. Give me a fine June morning in the country, and a tramp round the farm, or an early morning start in September walking down the partridges, or a gray day in November with a good gee underneath, plenty of grass ahead, and hounds talking. Good God, <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> England." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And so this {{inhabitant}} of {{the second}} {{city in the world}} reposes himself and begins to snore, while I sit there musing over things and wishing <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the West, where you could always depend on a customer fighting to keep his money hard enough to let your conscience take it from him.|$|E
6000|$|The next {{afternoon}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the big woods to investigate. Fifty feet behind the thicket where I {{had been struck}} was a tall dead stub overlooking a little clearing. [...] "That's his watch tower," [...] I thought. [...] "While I was watching the deer, he was up there watching my head, and when it moved he swooped." ...|$|E
6000|$|The stuffy {{little room}} was crowded when I reached it, and lit by three {{flickering}} candles. I felt <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the eighteenth century. There lay my poor uncle amidst indescribably tumbled bedclothes, weary of life beyond measure, weary and rambling, {{and the little}} clergyman trying to hold his hand and his attention, and repeating over and over again: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Miss Elphinspoon," [...] he said, [...] "I think <b>I</b> {{know what}} <b>is</b> coming. Will {{you wait for}} me here? <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> half an hour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not to my knowledge," [...] she declared. [...] "Not at {{any rate}} until the next meeting of the Council. <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> town before then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> enjoying {{myself over}} half the civilized globe," [...] he answered, with a {{somewhat}} forced laugh. [...] "Switzerland, Italy, and Spain have all been benefited by my presence, but I got tired of it, so here <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> my proper sphere, and delighted to again behold these dear familiar faces," [...] and he pointed to his ample collection of classics. [...] "But let me hear about yourself, Angela. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> tired of No. 1, I can assure you." ...|$|R
