40|$|A layer-wise {{theory with}} the {{analysis}} of <b>face</b> <b>ply</b> independent of lamination {{is used in the}} bending of symmetric laminates with anisotropic plies. More realistic and practical edge conditions as in Kirchhoff's theory are considered. An iterative procedure based on point-wise equilibrium equations is adapted. The necessity of a solution of an auxiliary problem in the interior plies is explained and used in the generation of proper sequence of two dimensional problems. Displacements are expanded in terms of polynomials in thickness coordinate such that continuity of transverse stresses across interfaces is assured. Solution of a fourth order system of a supplementary problem in the <b>face</b> <b>ply</b> is necessary to ensure the continuity of in-plane displacements across interfaces and to rectify inadequacies of these polynomial expansions in the interior distribution of approximate solutions. Vertical deflection does not play any role in obtaining all six stress components and two in-plane displacements. In overcoming lacuna in Kirchhoff's theory, widely used first order shear deformation theory and other sixth and higher order theories based on energy principles at laminate level in smeared laminate theories and at ply level in layer-wise theories are not useful in the generation of a proper sequence of 2 -D problems converging to 3 -D problems. Relevance of present analysis is demonstrated through solutions in a simple text book problem of simply supported square plate under doubly sinusoidal load...|$|E

40|$|Cellular {{structures}} are generally assembled with <b>face</b> sheet <b>plies</b> in their application. It {{is necessary to}} understand the influence of assembled plies on deformation and energy absorption before using textile composite cellular structures in engineering design. In this paper, effects of ply assembly, outer ply material, outer ply thickness, and loading area on energy absorption and deformation of the applied structure including cellular structure and <b>face</b> sheet <b>plies</b> are investigated. Three-dimensional finite element analyses are carried out employing orthotropic mechanical properties of the applied materials, textile composite, wood, E-glass, aluminium alloy 2024 -T 3 and unidirectional fiber-epoxy composite T- 300. The predicted results show that deformation and distributed strain energy density of both outer and inner surfaces of the applied structure are significantly affected by ply assembly, outer ply material, outer ply thickness, and loading area...|$|R
60|$|We {{would that}} those ministers {{who feel that}} they cannot compose without a study, and that the airiest and pleasantest room in the house, where the floor is guarded by the thick carpet, the light {{carefully}} relieved by curtains, where papers are filed and arranged neatly in conveniences purposely adjusted, with books of reference standing invitingly around, could once figure to themselves the process of composing a sermon in circumstances such as we have painted. Mr. Stanton had written his text, and jotted down something of an introduction, when a circumstance occurred which is almost inevitable in situations where a person has any thing else to attend to--the baby woke. The little interloper was to be tied into a chair, while the flaxen-headed young housekeeper was now installed into the office of waiter in ordinary to her majesty, and by shaking a newspaper before her <b>face,</b> <b>plying</b> a rattle, or other arts known only to the initiate, to prevent her from indulging in any unpleasant demonstrations, while Mr. Stanton proceeded with his train of thought.|$|R
6000|$|The summer passed, {{and always}} {{there was that}} little patch of silence in her heart, and in his. The tall, bright days grew taller, slowly passed their zenith, slowly shortened. On Saturdays and Sundays, {{sometimes}} with Winton and little Gyp, but more often alone, they went on the river. For Gyp, it had never lost the magic of their first afternoon upon it--never lost its glamour as of an enchanted world. All the week she looked forward to these hours of isolation with him, as if the surrounding water secured her not only against a world that would take him from her, if it could, but against that side of his nature, which, so long ago she had named [...] "old Georgian." [...] She had once adventured to the law courts by herself, {{to see him in}} his wig and gown. Under that stiff grey crescent on his broad forehead, he seemed so hard and clever--so of a world to which she never could belong, so of a piece with the brilliant bullying of the whole proceeding. She had come away feeling that she only possessed and knew one side of him. On the river, she had that side utterly--her lovable, lazy, impudently loving boy, lying with his head in her lap, plunging in for a swim, splashing round her; or with his sleeves rolled up, his neck bare, and a smile on his <b>face,</b> <b>plying</b> his slow sculls down-stream, singing, [...] "Away, my rolling river," [...] or puffing home like a demon in want of his dinner. It was such a blessing to lose for a few hours each week this growing consciousness that she could never have the whole of him. But all the time the patch of silence grew, for doubt in the heart of one lover reacts on the heart of the other.|$|R

40|$|A {{rotorcraft}} roof {{sandwich panel}} has been redesigned to optimize sound power transmission loss (TL) and minimize structure-borne sound for frequencies between 1 and 4 kHz where gear meshing {{noise from the}} transmission has {{the most impact on}} speech intelligibility. The roof section, framed by a grid of ribs, was originally constructed of a single honeycomb core/composite face sheet panel. The original panel has coincidence frequencies near 700 Hz, leading to poor TL across the frequency range of 1 to 4 kHz. To quiet the panel, the cross section was split into two thinner sandwich subpanels separated by an air gap. The air gap was sized to target the fundamental mass-spring-mass resonance of the double panel system to less than 500 Hz. The panels were designed to withstand structural loading from normal rotorcraft operation, as well as 'man-on-the-roof' static loads experienced during maintenance operations. Thin layers of VHB 9469 viscoelastomer from 3 M were also included in the <b>face</b> sheet <b>ply</b> layups, increasing panel damping loss factors from about 0. 01 to 0. 05. Measurements in the NASA SALT facility show the optimized panel provides 6 - 11 dB of acoustic transmission loss improvement, and 6 - 15 dB of structure-borne sound reduction at critical rotorcraft transmission tonal frequencies. Analytic panel TL theory simulates the measured performance quite well. Detailed finite element/boundary element modeling of the baseline panel simulates TL slightly more accurately, and also simulates structure-borne sound well...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1998 A {{changing}} {{raw material}} supply and smaller, generally lower quality peeler logs, are causing surface characteristics in veneer that can adversely affect glue-bond performance. When lower quality logs are peeled, rougher veneer is usually produced. The typical response by plywood manufacturers {{is to increase}} adhesive spread when using rough veneer. The effectiveness of increasing adhesive spread rates has not been quantified. To do so, a method to quantify roughness is needed {{so that it can}} be correlated with percent wood failure, the standard for defining glue-bond quality. The objectives of this research were to define the relationships between seven traditional 2 - dimensional measures of surface roughness and glue-bond performance in order to determine if a measure or combination of measures could be used to develop a glue-bond performance prediction model. Rotary peeled, 1 / 8 inch thick Douglas-fir veneer was visually categorized as being smooth, intermediate, or rough. Samples on each sheet were selected at random and their locations tracked throughout the study. The surface roughness of each sample was measured on the tight and loose sides using a modified laser scatter/optical imaging system. The scanning data were used to calculate seven roughness measures. Three-ply plywood panels were manufactured using the measured samples as core material and smooth veneer as <b>face</b> and back <b>plys.</b> Each panel was cut into standard shear specimens according to U. S. Product Standard 1 - 95. The test area for each shear specimen was the measured sample selected prior to panel assembly. The shear specimens were tested and evaluated for load at failure and percent wood failure. Each of the roughness measures and visual categories were compared to load at failure and percent wood failure data. Each shear specimen was also examined to determine the nature of the failure and with the failure being categorized into one of seven types. Analysis of variance and multiple linear regression tests indicated no statistically significant relationship between any of the seven roughness measures or combination of measures and load at failure or percent wood failure. There was also no significant difference in roughness between the tight and loose side of the veneer, except for the skewness, kurtosis, and 3 rd highest peak measures. Analysis of the visual categories showed there was strong evidence that an increase in surface roughness was associated with a decrease in load at failure and percent wood failure. This indicates that a 3 - dimensional measure of surface roughness may be more effective for modeling glue-bond performance. Analysis of the nature of failure data indicated that the samples tended to fail on the loose side of the veneer. This trend was noted across all roughness categories. It is believed that this may be associated with lathe check depth and that an interaction between lathe check depth and veneer roughness may determine glue-bond performance...|$|R
