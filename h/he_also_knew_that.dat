5|$|By December 1989, Stone began {{approaching}} studios to {{back his}} film. While in pre-production on The Doors, {{he met with}} three executives at Warner Bros. who wanted {{him to make a}} film about Howard Hughes. However, Warren Beatty owned the rights and so Stone pitched JFK. Studio president and Chief Operating Officer Terry Semel liked the idea. He had a reputation for making political and controversial films, including All the President's Men, The Parallax View and The Killing Fields. Stone made a handshake deal with Warner Bros. whereby the studio would get all the rights to the film and put up $20 million for the budget. The director did this so that the screenplay would not be widely read and bid on, and <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the material was potentially dangerous and wanted only one studio to finance it. Finally, Stone liked Semel's track record of producing political films.|$|E
25|$|Rickover {{preferred}} life {{on smaller}} ships, and <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> young {{officers in the}} submarine service were advancing quickly, {{so he went to}} Washington and volunteered for submarine duty. His application was turned down due to his age, at that time 29 years. Fortunately for Rickover, he ran into his former commanding officer from Nevada while leaving the building, who interceded successfully on his behalf. From 1929 to 1933, Rickover qualified for submarine duty and command aboard the submarines S-9 and S-48. While at the Office of the Inspector of Naval Material in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1933, Rickover translated Das Unterseeboot (The Submarine) by World War I German Imperial Navy Admiral Hermann Bauer. Rickover's translation became a basic text for the U.S. submarine service.|$|E
25|$|Flaccus was a {{perceptive}} politician, {{who looked}} for young and emergent men to support him. He had observed Cato's martial spirit and heard his eloquent tongue. He {{knew how much}} courage and persuasiveness were valued at Rome. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> distinction achieved on the battlefield opened the way to achievements in the higher civil offices. Finally, Flaccus knew too that for a stranger like Cato, {{the only way to}} the magisterial honors was success in the Roman Forum. For that reason, he suggested to Cato that he shift his ambition to the fruitful field of Roman politics. The advice was keenly followed. Invited to the townhouse of Flaccus, and ratified by his support, Cato began to distinguish himself in the forum, and became a candidate for assuming a post in the magistracy.|$|E

25|$|After Gordon's Confederates {{surprise}} attack on Fort Stedman in the pre-dawn hour of March 25, 1865 had some initial success, a Union counterattack at the Battle of Fort Stedman recaptured the fort {{and forced the}} Confederates {{to return to their}} lines and give up their advance picket line, including much of the western part of that line in the afternoon at the Battle of Jones's Farm. The Confederates suffered about 4,000 casualties which they could ill afford. After the defeat at Fort Stedman, Lee knew that he could not detach part of his army and be able to maintain the defenses of Petersburg and Richmond. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> Grant would soon move against the only remaining Confederate supply lines to Petersburg, the Southside Railroad and the Boydton Plank Road, beyond the end of his current defenses.|$|E

Lü Meng was also appointed as the Administrator (太守) of Hanchang Commandery (漢昌郡; southeast of present-day Pingjiang County, Hunan) and received Xiajun (下雋), Liuyang (劉陽), Hanchang and Zhouling (州陵) counties as his personal estate. He was stationed near the Sun-Liu border, which was guarded by Liu Bei's general Guan Yu on the other side. Lü Meng was aware of Guan Yu's military prowess and his intention of seizing Sun Quan's territories in Jing Province. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> Guan Yu was in a strategic position on the upstream of the Yangtze River. He recognised that the temporary stability and truce between Sun Quan and Liu Bei would not last long.|$|E
500|$|Most airmen doubted {{they would}} ever get out of Buchenwald because their {{documents}} were stamped with the acronym [...] "DIKAL" [...] (Darf in kein anderes Lager), or [...] "not {{to be transferred to}} another camp". At great risk, Lamason and Burney secretly smuggled a note through a trusted Russian prisoner, who worked at the nearby Nohra airfield, to the German Luftwaffe of their captivity at the camp. The message requested in part, that an officer pass the information to Berlin, and for the Luftwaffe to intercede on behalf of the airmen. Lamason understood that the Luftwaffe would be sympathetic to their predicament, as they would not want their captured men treated in the same way; <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the Luftwaffe had the political connections to get the airmen transferred to a POW camp.|$|E

500|$|After the afternoon's initial skirmishing {{with the}} French, Kutuzov held a council {{of war on}} the evening of 10 November at Melk, at the great abbey there. He knew several things. First, he knew the {{positions}} of the French from prisoners his Cossacks had captured. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> Gazan had crossed at Linz and was well ahead of any French reinforcements: Dupont had crossed at Passau and, by 10 November, stood at Marbach, [...] upstream, and Dumonceau was another [...] further behind Dupont. Kutuzov knew the size of the French force—its division strength—and its positions, and he knew that most of the dragoons were not covering the French flank but had turned north. He also knew, or had made a good supposition, about Napoleon's orders, so he knew what to offer Mortier and Gazan as bait.|$|E
500|$|In 1942 Britten {{read the}} work of the poet George Crabbe for the first time. The Borough, set on the Suffolk coast close to Britten's homeland, awakened in him such longings for England that he knew he must return. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> he must write an opera based on Crabbe's poem about the {{fisherman}} Peter Grimes. Before Britten left the US, Koussevitzky, always generous in encouraging new talent, offered him a $1,000 commission to write the opera. Britten and Pears returned to England in April 1942. During the long transatlantic sea crossing Britten completed the choral works A Ceremony of Carols and Hymn to St Cecilia. The latter was his last large-scale collaboration with Auden. Britten had grown away from him, and Auden became one of the composer's so-called [...] "corpses" [...] – former intimates from whom he completely cut off contact once they had outlived their usefulness to him or offended him in some way.|$|E
500|$|As he {{explained}} {{in his memoir}} The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government, Davis believed that each state was sovereign and had an unquestionable right to secede from the Union. At the same time, he counseled delay among his fellow Southerners, {{because he did not}} think that the North would permit the peaceable exercise of the right to secession. Having served as secretary of war under President Pierce, <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the South lacked the military and naval resources necessary for defense in a war. Following the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, however, events accelerated. South Carolina adopted an ordinance of secession on December 20, 1860, and Mississippi did so on January 9, 1861. Davis had expected this but waited until he received official notification. On January 21, the day Davis called [...] "the saddest day of my life", he delivered a farewell address to the United States Senate, resigned and returned to Mississippi.|$|E

2500|$|This {{created a}} serious problem for Scott. He was troubled by the sweep of guilty verdicts. He {{did not want to}} {{alienate}} the Mexican public, who by now had made the deserters national heroes. Nor did he want to encourage insurgency among the Mexican people that would weaken his pacification program in progress. <b>He</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the deserters were Irish-born Catholics, who had deserted Taylor's army because they allegedly felt mistreated and had witnessed atrocities [...] "sufficient to make Heaven weep" [...] against fellow Catholics, the Mexicans. In response to these, in 1847, Scott ordered that Protestants respect Catholic ceremonies.|$|E
50|$|Briefly, {{the story}} runs as follows: Uncle Joe and Uncle Jim are {{walking to the}} barber shop.

2500|$|Composer {{and actor}} Max Morath found it {{striking}} {{that the vast}} majority of Joplin's work did not enjoy the popularity of the [...] "Maple Leaf Rag", because while the compositions were of increasing lyrical beauty and delicate syncopation they remained obscure and unheralded during his lifetime. Joplin apparently realized that his music was ahead of its time: As music historian Ian Whitcomb mentions that Joplin, [...] "...opined that [...] "Maple Leaf Rag" [...] would make him 'King of Ragtime Composers' but <b>he</b> <b>also</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> he would not be a pop hero in his own lifetime. 'When I'm dead twenty-five years, people are going to recognize me,' he told a friend."
