25|$|The {{source of}} Agnes Greys renewed {{interest}} in poetry is, however, the curate to whom she is attracted. William Weightman aroused much curiosity. It seems clear he was a good-looking, engaging young man, whose easy humour and kindness towards the sisters made a considerable impression. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> character that she portrays in Edward Weston, and that her heroine Agnes Grey finds deeply appealing.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> curious position, {{hollow and}} rotten to the heart’s core, {{to have made}} all over the State large uncomfortable {{communities}} of people whom you call refugees and say you are protecting, but who call themselves prisoners of war, compulsorily detained, and detesting your protection. They are tired of being told by officers that they are refugees under “the kind and beneficient protection of the British”. In most cases there is no pretence that there was treachery, or ammunition concealed, or food given or anything. It was just that an order was given to empty the country. Though the camps are called refugee, there are in reality a very few of these–perhaps only half-a-dozen in some camps. It is easy to tell them, because they are put in the best marquees, and have had time given to them to bring furniture and clothes, and are mostly self-satisfied and vastly superior people. Very few, if any of them, are in want.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of this exercise because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> common and necessary command for a dog. Generally the handler will order {{the dog to}} sit and stay and then the judge will order the handler {{to walk away from}} the dog. Depending on the level of the competition the judge will order the handler to: walk around the ring, walk to the other side of the ring and wait for an order to return, or walk out of sight of the dog and wait for an order to return. In the later two cases the length of time before the judge orders the handler to return, and the time the dog must remain sitting, increases depending on the class the team is competing in. This exercise can also be performed in a group where as many as 10 dogs may perform the exercise simultaneously. In any case should a dog break the sit by lying down or getting up to walk around the team will usually fail the exercise and receive a non qualifying score for the class.|$|E

500|$|What makes [...] "Ray Of Light" [...] one of Madonna's best singles is {{the fact}} that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> bitch to sing. Filled with {{multiple}} octave changes, it forced Madonna to push her vocal as far as it could possibly go. The song demanded she make use of her upper register and hold notes longer than she ever had before. It really is a techno gem that is always a standout at her concerts.

I had to go up the fucking ladder until finally the word came down and said: 'Let him call it what he wants to call it'." [...] Michael Gray has suggested that the very title of the album represents Dylan's insistence that his songs are rooted in the traditions of the blues: [...] "Indeed the album title Highway 61 Revisited announces that we are in for a long revisit, since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> long, blues-travelled highway. Many bluesmen had been there before , all recording versions of a blues called 'Highway 61'." ...|$|E

Nevertheless, she is a dear person; just like a very fat rather stupid little dog. I think the book will go all right when once started." [...] Three weeks later, she wrote, [...] "The hedgehog drawings are turning out very comical. I have dressed up a cottonwool dummy for convenience of drawing the clothes. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> figure of fun."

500|$|The game {{received}} generally negative reviews at release, garnering {{scores of}} 50% and 49/100 by aggregate sites GameRankings and Metacritic respectively. Computer and Video Games said [...] "Eorzea {{is a beautiful}} world with huge potential for vast adventures, but it's just a shame that this first voyage into <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> mis-step". 1UP.com said that [...] "playing [...] is like playing with a toy stuck in a plastic bag: it can be fun {{for a while and}} you can get the general idea, but you can't appreciate the full experience", stating that future updates would likely rectify this issue. IGN said that [...] "Much of the promise of the combat system and depth of the crafting mechanics are drowned, unfortunately, under a sea of interface and performance issues that hinder the experience at nearly every step", further stating that while patches might improve the experience, its state {{at the time of the}} review made it [...] "not a world worth visiting". GameSpot, in addition to warning players away from the game, said that [...] "Final Fantasy XIV is a notable entry to the genre but only for what it lacks".|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to other [...] "mainstays" [...] of modern-day youth, technology serves {{an important role}} in the series, specifically the Internet and Kim's gadgets, the most significant of which is a cell phone-like device known as a Kimmunicator, designed to help Kim communicate with Wade and allow her access to virtually any information she desires. McCorkle elaborated on the show's emphasis on technology: [...] "Using the Internet theme in the series became an easy launching pad partially because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> major part of the fabric of teen life and the interactive possibilities are endless ... It's as though we get to play James Bond's 'Q' for each episode -- the more imaginative the toy, the better." [...] Particularly desirable to younger viewers, technology allows Kim to travel around the world effortlessly and to some extent mirrors children's ability to speak to anyone anywhere in the world via the Internet. Kim's ability to travel virtually anywhere around the world within a short period of time is left largely unexplained; BuzzFeed referred to Wade as an [...] "example that sitting in front of your computer all day is actually the most powerful position to be in." [...] The fact that Wade never leaves his bedroom could potentially indicate that he suffers from agoraphobia.|$|E
500|$|On 8 June 2007, Alonso {{signed a}} five-year contract, stating, [...] "I {{knew there was}} {{interest}} from other clubs {{but it was always}} my idea to stay here. I have been here for three seasons now and have such special feelings for the club and the supporters. I understand what Liverpool means to so many people. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> special club and I just didn't want to leave." [...] The 2007–08 season started well for the Spaniard: Gerrard's absence led to Alonso playing in a more advanced position and he scored twice in a 6–0 rout against Premier League newcomers Derby County. The bright beginning was short-lived, however, as a minor injury sustained in a game against Portsmouth became aggravated in training. The metatarsal injury forced him out of training for six weeks but his return to the first team was rushed and his injury recurred in his first game back. Alonso's determination and passion proved to be his downfall, and he later reflected, [...] "I had been feeling a bit tired around that time because it was only my first game back and the match was very fast. But as a player you don't want to come off, particularly when the team is winning and I stayed on." ...|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} negative {{reviews in}} trade publications {{and it was}} deemed a distinct departure from the nature of other Thanhouser releases. The film's plot was criticized by reviewers for being concerned main character's misery. In response to the illogical plot, the The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer stated, [...] "Why the cripple should go West {{as soon as he}} is able to hobble isn't clear; perhaps the West is such a delightfully vague term that it induces haziness of reasoning." [...] The reviewer also noted the inexplicable reason why Allen, who originally fled, would suddenly consent to be willingly murdered by John. The reviewer opined that the story was almost maudlin in places and the acting was not sincere because the actors knew the plot was absurd. The Moving Picture World also reviewed the film quite negatively, [...] "Possibly the dramatic qualities of this picture are sufficient reason for its existence; but it has no other reason. It is not entertaining. It is not instructive. It cannot amuse. The shadow of death pervades it and the horror tragedy is the principal factor. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> departure from the usual Thanhouser that it seems as though the regular producer was absent when it flipped past the company's censor." [...] Advertisers for the film listed it {{in a variety of ways}} from a strong drama to having real mining activities. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

[...] Before the season finale aired, Jensen ranked this as the second best moment {{of the season and}} put the scene in which the monster attacks the mercenaries in ninth place. [...] Dan Kois and Lane Brown of New York magazine thought that this [...] "episode didn't exactly feel like the usual moderately paced, secret-revealing drama Lost usually is; it felt like an action movie... it was like watching Die Hard on an island". [...] Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode a 9.3/10, concluding that [...] "if 'The Shape of Things to Come' is any indication of the level of quality that [...] should expect from here on out then we are in for some incredible storytelling" [...] and [...] "Alex's death will probably be remembered as one of the more pivotal scenes in the entire series [...] <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> phenomenally shot, edited and acted moment... it would be incredibly hard not to feel for [...] here." [...] Upon grading the best episodes of the first five seasons, the episode ranked second, beating episodes like [...] "Through the Looking Glass" [...] and the pilot and losing to [...] "The Constant." [...] Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad summed up [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] as [...] "a brilliant episode... tons of action, several big revelations, and more questions to ponder". [...] Don Williams of BuddyTV decided that the episode was [...] "worth waiting five weeks for" [...] and [...] "so jam packed that I need to give my brain time to rest". [...] Williams's colleague Oscar Dahl ranked the scene in which Alex is killed as the fifth best moment of the season, noting that [...] "it was perfectly paced... and provided a huge shock... and some of the best acting you'll ever see". [...] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post wrote that [...] "'The Shape of Things to Come' was the perfect episode to get everyone back into the swing of Lost. [...] It wasn't a [...] à la 'The Constant'. [...] It was an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride, which to me matched the 'Pilot' bombastic grandeur".|$|E
