5|$|Sai Baba's date {{of birth}} {{including}} his birthplace remains unknown and <b>is</b> <b>debatable</b> {{due to lack of}} evidence and no definitive information exists to prove it.|$|E
5|$|The {{validity}} of these accounts <b>is</b> <b>debatable.</b> In Roman political culture, insanity and sexual perversity were often presented hand-in-hand with poor government.|$|E
5|$|David Crowe {{writes that}} the SS had become an {{economic}} force {{in its own right}} by 1944, thanks to its plundering of Jewish businesses and ownership of factories that used slave labour from concentration camps. Jewish rescue workers made several attempts to exploit SS corruption. Gisi Fleischmann and Rabbi Michael Dov Weissmandl paid Dieter Wisliceny $20,000 in 1942 to suspend the deportation of Jews from Slovakia, though whether the bribe was the reason for the suspension <b>is</b> <b>debatable.</b>|$|E
50|$|All main motions <b>are</b> <b>debatable.</b> Other motions {{may or may}} not <b>be</b> <b>debatable.</b> The debatability of motions {{depends on}} the purpose of the motion. For example, the purpose of the motion to limit debate would be {{defeated}} if this motion itself could be debated; therefore, the motion to limit debate <b>is</b> not <b>debatable.</b>|$|R
50|$|Exact figures <b>are</b> <b>debatable,</b> because {{methods of}} {{estimating}} reserves vary {{and it is}} often difficult to forecast future discoveries.|$|R
50|$|While the {{official}} boundaries of Edwalton <b>are</b> <b>debatable,</b> Boundary Road <b>is</b> commonly accepted as {{the border between}} West Bridgford and Edwalton.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{there were four}} notable Christian heavy metal groups: Messiah Prophet, Leviticus, Saint, and Stryper. Although it <b>is</b> <b>debatable</b> as to which band was formed first, the Orange County native glam metal group Stryper {{was the most popular}} one. Stryper was also the first band to {{identify}} as Christian metal. Stryper gained attention with their way of throwing Bibles to the audience at their concerts. In the beginning, mostly Christians went to Stryper's concerts but soon they reached non-Christian audience. In the 1980s, Christian metal bands closely followed the trends of mainstream metal bands.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} said that an error of fact {{involves}} a situation where there are new or different primary facts yet to be put before the court, such as a new witness, or what people saw or heard, whereas an error of law involves a misinterpretation of a statutory word or phrase with regard to such facts. However, this distinction <b>is</b> <b>debatable,</b> and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an error of law if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place.|$|E
5|$|One {{argument}} leveled by Westmoreland at {{the time}} (and often quoted by historians of the battle) was that only two Marine regiments were tied down at Khe Sanh compared with several NVA divisions. But, {{at the time}} Hanoi {{made the decision to}} move in around the base, Khe Sanh was held by only two (or even just one) American battalions. It <b>is</b> <b>debatable</b> whether the destruction of one battalion could have been the goal of two to four NVA divisions. Yet, even if Westmoreland believed his statement, his argument never moved on to the next logical level. By the end of January 1968, he had moved half of all US combat troops—nearly fifty maneuver battalions—to I Corps.|$|E
50|$|Other {{researchers}} {{not normally}} {{involved in the}} debate over bird origins, such as Zhou, acknowledged that the true affinities of Caudipteryx <b>were</b> <b>debatable.</b>|$|R
50|$|Whether {{classifying}} silver's {{movement as}} a 'bubble' (seen when comparing silver with gold) has <b>been</b> <b>debatable</b> with Peter Schiff denying that a bubble ever existed.|$|R

5|$|Stephen Gardiner was refused {{access to}} Henry {{during his last}} months. Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, found himself accused of treason; {{the day before the}} king's death his vast estates were seized, making them {{available}} for redistribution, and he spent the whole of Edward's reign in the Tower of London. Other historians have argued that Gardiner's exclusion was based on non-religious matters, that Norfolk was not noticeably conservative in religion, that conservatives remained on the Council, and that the radicalism of such men as Sir Anthony Denny, who controlled the dry stamp that replicated the king's signature, <b>is</b> <b>debatable.</b>|$|E
5|$|The wall {{contained}} nine main gates, which pierced {{both the}} inner and the outer walls, {{and a number of}} smaller posterns. The exact identification of several gates <b>is</b> <b>debatable</b> for a number of reasons. The Byzantine chroniclers provide more names than the number of the gates, the original Greek names fell mostly out of use during the Ottoman period, and literary and archaeological sources provide often contradictory information. Only three gates, the Golden Gate, the Gate of Rhegion and the Gate of Charisius, can be established directly from the literary evidence.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possibility}} is that Lǫgmaðr regained some form of control in the Isles following Magnús' death, and afterwards joined Sigurðr's expedition to Holy Land {{in the first decade}} of the twelfth century. Whether Sigurðr's undertaking was a planned crusade per se, or merely an eventful and violent pilgrimage, <b>is</b> <b>debatable.</b> The precise chronology of this enterprise is similarly uncertain, although the Norwegian fleet certainly reached England before the end of the first decade of the twelfth century. It may have been at this point, whilst Sigurðr overwintered at the English royal court, that Lǫgmaðr joined up with him. If Lǫgmaðr and Sigurðr indeed rendezvoused in England, this may have been the time when Óláfr, the future King of the Isles, was entrusted to the safekeeping of the English king.|$|E
5000|$|N96 has 8x image digital zoom and 4x video digital zoom (while N95 has 20x digital zoom and 8x video digital zoom), {{although}} {{the benefits of}} this <b>are</b> <b>debatable.</b>|$|R

30|$|In {{most cases}} {{connected}} with musculoskeletal research and publishing, {{the definition of}} study involving human participants is obvious and unquestionable. However, we ought to consider some special cases in which this assignment might <b>be</b> <b>debatable.</b>|$|R
5|$|In July 2000, Florentino Pérez {{was elected}} club president. He vowed in his {{campaign}} to erase the club's €270million debt and modernize the club's facilities. However, the primary electoral promise that propelled Pérez to victory was the signing of Luís Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona. The following year, the club had its training ground rezoned and used the money to begin assembling the Galácticos team by signing a global star every summer, which included Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luís Figo, David Beckham and Fabio Cannavaro. It <b>is</b> <b>debatable</b> whether the gamble paid off, as despite winning the UEFA Champions League and an Intercontinental Cup in 2002, followed by La Liga in 2003, the club failed {{to win a major}} trophy for the next three seasons.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that a question of fact involves a matter concerning primary facts such as a new witness or what people saw or heard, while a question of law involves an application of a statutory word or phase to such facts. However, this distinction <b>is</b> <b>debatable,</b> and the view has been taken that courts sometimes simply regard a matter as one involving an error of law if they wish to adopt an interventionist approach, and seek to allow judicial review to take place. In any case, it is said that the courts generally treat errors of fact committed by public authorities differently from errors of law. While errors of law are regarded by the courts as within their jurisdiction and thus subject to judicial review, they show more reluctance to intervene when errors of fact are alleged.|$|E
5|$|The distant {{vision of}} a frog is better than its near vision. Calling frogs will quickly become silent when they see an {{intruder}} or even a moving shadow but the closer an object is, the less well it is seen. When a frog shoots out its tongue to catch an insect it is reacting to a small moving object that it cannot see well and must line it up precisely beforehand because it shuts its eyes as the tongue is extended. Whether a frog sees in colour <b>is</b> <b>debatable</b> {{but it has been}} shown that it responds positively to blue light, perhaps because that colour is associated with bodies of water that can provide refuge when the frog feels threatened.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} damage inflicted by Wheeler's force during the battle <b>was</b> <b>debatable.</b> Nevertheless, Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas {{reported}} the track south of Dalton was quickly repaired and trains were running by August 17.|$|R
25|$|The {{volcanic}} activity of Nemrut occurred in three stages: {{the formation of}} a cone (pre-caldera stage), the post-caldera stage, and the late stage. Further, divisions <b>are</b> <b>debatable</b> and <b>are</b> based on different interpretations of the stratigraphic data.|$|R
5000|$|The junta later {{changed its}} English name to simply [...] "Council for Democratic Reform" [...] {{claiming}} that the change was in order to remove misunderstanding and false interpretation {{about the role of}} the monarchy. Actual rationale <b>was</b> <b>debatable.</b>|$|R
5|$|John FitzAlan {{was born}} at Lytchett Matravers in Dorset on 14 February 1408. He {{was the son of}} John FitzAlan, 3rd Baron Maltravers (13851421) and Eleanor (d. 1455), {{daughter}} of Sir John Berkeley of Beverstone, Gloucestershire. John FitzAlan the elder, through his great-great-grandfather Richard FitzAlan, 4th Earl of Arundel, made a claim on the earldom of Arundel after the death of Thomas FitzAlan, 5th Earl of Arundel, in 1415. The claim was disputed, however, by Thomas's three sisters and their families, foremost among these Elizabeth FitzAlan, who had married Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk. It <b>is</b> <b>debatable</b> whether Maltravers ever held the title of Earl of Arundel; he was summoned to parliament under this title once, in 1416, but never again. When he died in 1421, the dispute continued under his son, and it was not until in 1433 that the younger John FitzAlan finally had his title confirmed in parliament. Four years earlier, in July 1429, he had received his late father's estates and title.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{response}} to the new crusade bull was poor, and it in fact had to be reissued {{when it was clear}} that Louis VII of France would be taking part in the expedition. Louis VII had also been considering a new expedition independently of the Pope, which he announced to his Christmas court at Bourges in 1145. It <b>is</b> <b>debatable</b> whether Louis was planning a crusade of his own or in fact a pilgrimage, as he wanted to fulfil a vow made by his dead brother Philip to go to the Holy Land. It is probable that Louis had made this decision independently of hearing about Quantum Praedecessores. In any case, Abbot Suger and other nobles were not in favour of Louis' plans, as he would be gone from the kingdom for several years. Louis consulted Bernard of Clairvaux, who referred him back to Eugene. By now Louis would have definitely heard about the papal bull, and Eugene enthusiastically supported Louis' crusade. The bull was reissued on 1 March 1146, and Eugene authorized Bernard to preach the news throughout France.|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} dolphin-safe {{standards}} {{on the price}} of tuna <b>is</b> <b>debatable.</b> While the trend in cost has been downward, critics claim that the price would have dropped much further without the dolphin-safe standards.|$|E
50|$|What {{does and}} does not {{constitute}} a dialog system may <b>be</b> <b>debatable.</b> The typical GUI wizard does engage {{in some sort of}} dialog, but it includes very few of the common dialog system components, and dialog state is trivial.|$|R
5000|$|Termination {{by mutual}} agreement: The {{employer}} and employee make a joint decision to end employment. Though it may <b>be</b> <b>debatable</b> if the termination was truly mutual, the employer offers the employee a [...] "softened firing" [...] {{in order to}} reduce backlash.|$|R
25|$|If the {{minority}} objects, those motions <b>are</b> <b>debatable</b> (and therefore {{subject to a}} filibuster) and divisible (meaning {{the minority}} can force them to be debated, and filibustered, separately). Additionally, after the first two motions pass, but before the third does, senators can offer an unlimited number of motions to give the special committee members non-binding instructions, which <b>are</b> themselves <b>debatable,</b> amendable, and divisible. As a result, a determined minority can cause {{a great deal of}} delay before a conference.|$|R
25|$|Rajabov {{suggests}} 3 more syntactical cases, namely possessive 1 (-łay), possessive 2 (-xu) and abessive (-tay). However, {{their status}} <b>is</b> <b>debatable,</b> {{as they seem}} to show both inflectional as well as derivational tendencies.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the playful}} music that accompanies Merry and Pippin in the cornfield is used when Bilbo {{is running out}} of his home. Whether or not there is a {{recurring}} leitmotif contained within the music <b>is</b> <b>debatable.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{article by}} Russell T Davies in the Doctor Who Annual 2006 states that Romana was President of the Time Lords during the Last Great Time War against the Daleks (see below), which ended with Gallifrey being destroyed. As with all {{spin-off}} media, its canonicity {{in relation to}} the television series <b>is</b> <b>debatable.</b>|$|E
5|$|These maps also {{differed}} {{somewhat in}} the boundaries given to Macedonia. Its only inarguable limits were the Aegean Sea and the Serbian and Bulgarian frontiers (as of 1885); where it bordered Old Serbia, Albania, and Thrace (all parts of Ottoman Rumelia) <b>was</b> <b>debatable.</b>|$|R
50|$|French Impressionist Cinema {{is a term}} {{applied to}} a loosely defined group of films and filmmakers in France from 1919-1929, {{although}} these years <b>are</b> <b>debatable.</b> French Impressionist filmmakers include Abel Gance, Jean Epstein, Germaine Dulac, Marcel L’Herbier, Louis Delluc, and Dmitry Kirsanoff.|$|R
50|$|Preliminary auditions {{are held}} in {{selected}} locations.
