5|$|Guinness <b>Flavour</b> Extract, a dehydrated, {{hopped wort}} extract made from barley malt and roasted barley, {{is used for}} {{overseas}} production of the stout. The syrup is shipped from Ireland, where it is added at the ratio of 1:49 to locally brewed pale beer. In most overseas markets, Guinness <b>Flavour</b> Extract (GFE) is blended with locally brewed beer to produce FES.|$|E
5|$|Its most {{noticeable}} effect {{is due to}} its first unique feature: <b>flavour</b> changing. A neutron, for example, is heavier than a proton (its sister nucleon), but it cannot decay into a proton without changing the <b>flavour</b> (type) {{of one of its}} two down quarks to an up quark. Neither the strong interaction nor electromagnetism permit <b>flavour</b> changing, so this proceeds by weak decay; without weak decay, quark properties such as strangeness and charm (associated with the quarks of the same name) would also be conserved across all interactions.|$|E
5|$|Maple syrup {{contains}} {{a wide variety}} of volatile organic compounds, including vanillin, hydroxybutanone, and propionaldehyde. It is not yet known exactly what compounds are responsible for maple syrup's distinctive <b>flavour,</b> however its primary <b>flavour</b> contributing compounds are maple furanone, strawberry furanone, and maltol.|$|E
50|$|All <b>flavours</b> of Bionade contain water, sugar, malt from barley (2%), carbon acid, calcium {{carbonate}} and magnesium carbonate. The herbal <b>flavoured</b> version also contains natural herb-aromas, the litchi <b>flavoured</b> version natural aroma, the elderberry <b>flavoured</b> version additionally contains concentrated elderberry juice and natural aromas and the orange-ginger <b>flavoured</b> bottles contain extract of ginger and natural aroma. The sugar, barley and elderberries originate from organic agriculture.|$|R
50|$|In 2009 J2O {{introduced}} two new <b>flavours,</b> Grape & Kiwi and Winter Berries. Both {{of these}} <b>flavours</b> were originally limited edition but {{have since been}} integrated into the range of permanent <b>flavours.</b> 2010 saw a major packaging redesign and {{the launch of the}} J2O White Blend range. Two <b>flavours,</b> one based on white grape, the other on red grape, are less sweet than the existing J2O <b>flavours</b> and are designed to complement food, {{in the same way that}} white and red wine does. Orange & passion fruit and apple & mango (the 2 most popular <b>flavours)</b> have been released in PET bottles.|$|R
50|$|Vendors {{have come}} up with several {{proprietary}} products and standardized <b>flavours</b> of Chaas which are produced on an industrial scale and sold as bottled drinks. The best-seller among such brands is Amul's Masala Chass, which has standardized several traditional <b>flavours</b> for the mass bottled-drink market. Other popular modern <b>flavours</b> which are only available as bottled drinks and cannot be made at home or in restaurants include rose-flavoured Chaas ("Chaas Gulabi") and Chaas <b>flavoured</b> with mint ("Mint Chaas"). Both these <b>flavours</b> are of the added-sugar variety and are different from <b>flavoured</b> lassi only for being more dilute and less expensive.|$|R
5|$|The innate <b>flavour</b> of {{the dried}} tea leaves is {{determined}} by the type of cultivar of the tea bush, the quality of the plucked tea leaves, and the manner and quality of the production processing they undergo. After processing, a tea may be blended with other teas or mixed with flavourants to alter the <b>flavour</b> of the final tea.|$|E
5|$|A study {{published}} in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the <b>flavour</b> of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the male participants, who wanted to drink more as a result. The 49 men in the study were subject to positron emission tomography scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer, water and a sports drink onto their tongues. Compared with the taste of the sports drink, the taste of beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink. Test results indicated that the <b>flavour</b> of the beer triggered a dopamine release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.|$|E

5|$|Common {{onions are}} {{normally}} available in three colour varieties. Yellow or brown onions (called red in some European countries), are full-flavoured {{and are the}} onions of choice for everyday use. Yellow onions turn a rich, dark brown when caramelised and give French onion soup its sweet <b>flavour.</b> The red onion (called purple in some European countries) {{is a good choice}} for fresh use when its colour livens up the dish; it is also used in grilling. White onions are the traditional onions used in classic Mexican cuisine; they have a golden colour when cooked and a particularly sweet <b>flavour</b> when sautéed.|$|E
5|$|Guinness <b>Flavour</b> Extract, a dehydrated, {{hopped wort}} extract made from barley malt and roasted barley, {{is used for}} {{overseas}} production of the stout. The syrup is shipped from Ireland, where it is added at the ratio of 1:49 to locally brewed pale beer. Each year, six million litres of GFE are made using 9,000 tonnes of barley. Guinness <b>Flavour</b> Extract was first created by scientists working for the company in the early 1960s. In 2003, production of GFE was relocated from St James's Gate to the former Cherry's brewery in Mary Street, Waterford, but in 2013 production returned to St James's.|$|E

5|$|Mould fungi are {{the source}} of the meaty (umami) <b>flavour</b> of the soybean {{products}} tempeh, miso and soy sauce. Tempeh has been produced in Java since the 13th century. Like tofu, it is made into protein-rich blocks, but these have a firm texture and earthy <b>flavour,</b> since (unlike tofu) the whole beans are retained, providing a higher content of dietary fibre and vitamins. Miso too is rich in protein, vitamins and minerals. It is fermented from a mixture of soybeans and cereals, forming a soft paste used to <b>flavour</b> soups and other Japanese dishes. Soy sauce has been used in China since the 2nd century AD, and is now widespread in Asia. Like miso, it is made by fermenting a mixture of soybeans and cereals with moulds such as Aspergillus oryzae.|$|E

50|$|The European Commission has {{declared}} diacetyl is legal {{for use as}} a <b>flavouring</b> substance in all EU states. As a diketone, diacetyl is included in the EU's <b>flavouring</b> classification <b>Flavouring</b> Group Evaluation 11 (FGE.11). A Scientific Panel of the EU Commission evaluated six <b>flavouring</b> substances (not including diacetyl) from FGE.11 in 2004. As part of this study, the panel reviewed available studies on several other flavourings in FGE.11, including diacetyl. Based on the available data, the panel reiterated the finding that there were no safety concerns for diacetyl's use as a <b>flavouring.</b>|$|R

5|$|Golden and Amber grades {{typically}} have a milder <b>flavour</b> than Dark and Very dark, which are both dark {{and have an}} intense maple <b>flavour.</b> The darker grades of syrup are used primarily for cooking and baking, although some specialty dark syrups are produced for table use. Syrup harvested {{earlier in the season}} tends to yield a lighter colour. With the new grading system, the classification of maple syrup depends ultimately on its internal transmittance at 560 nm wavelength through a 10 mm sample. Golden has to have 75 percent or more transmittance, Amber has to have 50.0 to 74.9 percent transmittance, Dark has to have 25.0 to 49.9 percent transmittance, and Very Dark is any product less than 25.0 percent transmittance.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Allied Breweries {{sold its}} 35 per cent {{stake in the}} company, leaving Whitbread 25 per cent and the Boddington family 10 per cent, with the {{remainder}} of company shares held by small shareholders in the Manchester area. That year Guinness Draught stout and Heineken lager were introduced into the tied estate. During the 1970s the company operated within a 70-mile radius of Manchester, and growth was driven by the increasing popularity of its main product, Boddingtons Bitter. The Observer commented in 1974 that Boddingtons cheap pricing and distinctive <b>flavour</b> afforded it an unusually loyal following. In 1981 the same newspaper commented, what has stood Boddingtons in good stead is the highly distinctive <b>flavour</b> of its brews, especially its bitters. In fact, in the North-West, Boddies is increasingly becoming a sort of cult brew.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that the Byzantine <b>flavour</b> to these images was also connected with contemporary attempts through diplomacy to achieve reconciliation with the Greek Orthodox Church, in which van Eyck's patron Philip the Good took a keen interest. Van Eyck's Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati (c. 1431) depicts one of the papal diplomats most involved with these efforts.|$|E

40|$|High field 1 H nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was used to analyse and characterize different <b>flavoured</b> olive oils, namely orange, basil, bergamot, cardamom, lemon, mandarin, chilli, rosemary, white and black truffle, ginger, garlic and mushroom <b>flavoured</b> olive oils. Several compounds were identified by means of 2 D NMR experiments and spiking experiments. In particular, limonene was found in lemon, bergamot, orange, mandarin, cardamom, ginger and chilli <b>flavoured</b> olive oils, p-cymene was found in lemon and bergamot <b>flavoured</b> olive oils, linalool was found in bergamot, basil and cardamom <b>flavoured</b> olive oils, α-curcumene was found in ginger <b>flavoured</b> olive oil and geranial and neral were found in lemon <b>flavoured</b> olive oil. Some implications regarding the product standardization and quality are discussed monitoring the acidity indirectly, by the measure of diglycerides and monoglycerides, {{and the amount of}} some minor compounds sensitive to the product shelf-life. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
