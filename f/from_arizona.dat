5|$|The {{earlier and}} more basal genus Huayangosaurus from the Middle Jurassic of China (some 165 {{million years ago}} – Mya) antedates Stegosaurus by 20 million years {{and is the only}} genus in the family Huayangosauridae.

Emausaurus from Germany was another small quadruped, while Scutellosaurus <b>from</b> <b>Arizona</b> was an even earlier genus and was facultatively bipedal. These small, lightly armored dinosaurs were closely related to the direct ancestor of both stegosaurs and ankylosaurs. A trackway of a possible early armored dinosaur, from around 195 Mya, has been found in France.|$|E

5|$|To {{understand}} {{the effects of}} sand for the Sandman, experiments were done with twelve types of sand, such as splashing, launching it at stuntmen, and pouring it over ledges. The results were mimicked on the computer to create the visual effects for Sandman. For scenes involving visual effects, Thomas Haden Church was super-imposed onto the screen, where computer-generated imagery was then applied. With sand as a possible hazard in scenes that buried actors, ground-up corncobs were used as a substitute instead. Because of its resemblance to the substance, sand <b>from</b> <b>Arizona</b> {{was used as the}} model for the CG sand. In a fight where Spider-Man punches through Sandman's chest, amputee martial arts expert Baxter Humby took Tobey Maguire's place in filming the scene. Humby, whose right hand was amputated at birth, helped deliver the intended effect of punching through Sandman's chest.|$|E
5|$|Aetosaur fossils {{have been}} found on all continents except Australia and Antarctica, giving them a nearly {{worldwide}} distribution during the Late Triassic. Many aetosaur remains {{have been found}} from the Chinle Group in the southwestern United States. Most fossils have been found <b>from</b> <b>Arizona,</b> New Mexico, and Texas. Some remains have also been found from Utah, particularly in Canyonlands National Park and Zion National Park. Aetosaurs are also known from the Newark Supergroup along the East Coast of the United States in states such as Connecticut and North Carolina. Two genera are known from Greenland: Aetosaurus and Paratypothorax. They have been found from the Fleming Fjord Formation in Jameson Land. Longosuchus is the only aetosaur known from Africa, with scutes having been found from the late Carnian Timesgadiouine Formation in Morocco. During the Late Triassic, Morocco {{would have been in}} close proximity with the Newark Supergroup of North America in the supercontinent of Pangaea. It is also possible that Desmatosuchus was present in Africa, as fossils have been found from the Zarzaitine Series in Algeria that were referred to the genus.|$|E
