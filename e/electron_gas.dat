5|$|Remote {{observation}} of electrons requires detection of their radiated energy. For example, in high-energy environments {{such as the}} corona of a star, free electrons form a plasma that radiates energy due to Bremsstrahlung radiation. <b>Electron</b> <b>gas</b> can undergo plasma oscillation, which is waves caused by synchronized variations in electron density, and these produce energy emissions that can be detected by using radio telescopes.|$|E
25|$|Electron {{degeneracy}} {{pressure is}} a quantum-mechanical effect {{arising from the}} Pauli exclusion principle. Since electrons are fermions, no two electrons {{can be in the}} same state, so not all electrons can be in the minimum-energy level. Rather, electrons must occupy a band of energy levels. Compression of the <b>electron</b> <b>gas</b> increases the number of electrons in a given volume and raises the maximum energy level in the occupied band. Therefore, the energy of the electrons increases on compression, so pressure must be exerted on the <b>electron</b> <b>gas</b> to compress it, producing electron degeneracy pressure. With sufficient compression, electrons are forced into nuclei in the process of electron capture, relieving the pressure.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} ways of fabricating a QPC. It can be realized in a break-junction by pulling apart a piece of conductor until it breaks. The breaking point forms the point contact. In a more controlled way, quantum point contacts are formed in a two-dimensional <b>electron</b> <b>gas</b> (2DEG), e.g. in GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. By applying a voltage to suitably shaped gate electrodes, the <b>electron</b> <b>gas</b> can be locally depleted and {{many different types of}} conducting regions can be created in the plane of the 2DEG, among them quantum dots and quantum point contacts. Another means of creating a QPC is by positioning the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope close to the surface of a conductor.|$|E

40|$|In high-mobility {{two-dimensional}} <b>electron</b> <b>gases</b> Landau {{levels are}} already formed at very small magnetic field values. Such two-dimensional <b>electron</b> <b>gases</b> show a huge negative magnetoresistance at low temperatures and an unexpected and very strong non-linear behavior with the applied current.

25|$|But, at {{the quantum}} phase transition, the {{localization}} lengths of the electrons becomes infinite (i.e. they delocalize) and this compromises the Fermi-liquid assumption of an inherently free <b>electron</b> <b>gas</b> (where individual electrons must be well-distinguished). The quantum Hall transition will therefore {{not be in}} the Fermi-liquid universality class, but in the F-invariant' universality class that has a different value for the critical exponent. The semi-classical percolation picture of the quantum Hall transition is therefore outdated (although still widely used) and we need to understand the delocalization mechanism as an instanton effect.|$|E
25|$|While quantum {{mechanics}} primarily {{applies to the}} smaller atomic regimes of matter and energy, some systems exhibit quantum mechanical effects on a large scale. Superfluidity, the frictionless flow of a liquid at temperatures near absolute zero, is one well-known example. So is the closely related phenomenon of superconductivity, the frictionless flow of an <b>electron</b> <b>gas</b> in a conducting material (an electric current) at sufficiently low temperatures. The fractional quantum Hall effect is a topological ordered state which corresponds to patterns of long-range quantum entanglement. States with different topological orders (or different patterns of long range entanglements) cannot change into each other without a phase transition.|$|E
25|$|To {{increase}} the {{mean free path}} of the <b>electron</b> <b>gas</b> interaction, a standard TEM is evacuated to low pressures, typically {{on the order of}} 10−4 Pa. The need for this is twofold: first the allowance for the voltage difference between the cathode and the ground without generating an arc, and secondly to reduce the collision frequency of electrons with gas atoms to negligible levels—this effect is characterized by the mean free path. TEM components such as specimen holders and film cartridges must be routinely inserted or replaced requiring a system with the ability to re-evacuate on a regular basis. As such, TEMs are equipped with multiple pumping systems and airlocks and are not permanently vacuum sealed.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of this semi-classical idea, many {{numerical}} computations were done based on the percolation picture. On top of the classical percolation phase transition, quantum tunneling was included in computer simulations to calculate the critical exponent of the `semi-classical percolation phase transition'. To compare this result with the measured critical exponent, the Fermi-liquid approximation was used, where the Coulomb interactions between electrons are assumed to be finite. Under this assumption, the ground state of the free <b>electron</b> <b>gas</b> can be adiabatically transformed into the ground state of the interacting system and this gives rise to an inelastic scattering length so that the canonical correlation length exponent can be compared to the measured critical exponent.|$|E
25|$|One {{model that}} {{estimates}} {{the properties of}} an <b>electron</b> <b>gas</b> at absolute zero in metals is the Fermi gas. The electrons, being Fermions, must be in different quantum states, which leads the electrons to get very high typical velocities, even at absolute zero. The maximum energy that electrons can have at absolute zero is called the Fermi energy. The Fermi temperature is defined as this maximum energy divided by Boltzmann's constant, and is {{of the order of}} 80,000 K for typical electron densities found in metals. For temperatures significantly below the Fermi temperature, the electrons behave in almost the same way as at absolute zero. This explains the failure of the classical equipartition theorem for metals that eluded classical physicists in the late 19th century.|$|E
25|$|The random {{disorder}} in the potential {{landscape of the}} two-dimensional <b>electron</b> <b>gas</b> {{plays a key role}} in the observation of topological sectors and their instantons (phase transitions). Because of the disorder, the electrons are localized and thus they cannot flow across the sample. But if we consider a loop around a localized 2D electron, we can notice that current is still able to flow in the direction around this loop. This current is able to renormalize to larger scales and eventually becomes the Hall current that rotates along the edge of the sample. A topological sector corresponds to an integer number of rotations and it is now visible macroscopically, in the robustly quantized behavior of the measurable Hall current. If the electrons were not sufficiently localized, this measurement would be blurred out by the usual flow of current through the sample.|$|E

Montroll recognised that this was Debye–Hückel theory.

500|$|Calculating {{electronic}} {{properties of}} metals by solving the many-body wavefunction is often computationally hard, and hence, approximation methods {{are needed to}} obtain meaningful predictions. The Thomas–Fermi theory, developed in the 1920s, was used to estimate system energy and electronic density by treating the local electron density as a variational parameter. Later in the 1930s, Douglas Hartree, Vladimir Fock and John Slater developed the so-called Hartree–Fock wavefunction as an improvement over the Thomas–Fermi model. The Hartree–Fock method accounted for exchange statistics of single particle electron wavefunctions. [...] In general, it's very difficult to solve the Hartree–Fock equation. [...] Only the free <b>electron</b> <b>gas</b> case can be solved exactly. Finally in 1964–65, Walter Kohn, Pierre Hohenberg and Lu Jeu Sham proposed the density functional theory which gave realistic descriptions for bulk and surface properties of metals.
