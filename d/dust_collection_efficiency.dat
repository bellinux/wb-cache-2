40|$|Water sprays {{have been}} {{commonly}} used to suppress airborne dust. Water is doped with surface-active agents to enhance the dust capture efficiency through a reduction of surface tension. Nevertheless, <b>dust</b> <b>collection</b> <b>efficiencies</b> have been less than satisfactory historically. A detailed characterization of freshly generated airborne dust particles and spray droplets {{was carried out in}} order to explain this observation. Such properties as the agglomeration state of the freshly generated airborne dust particles and the airborne dust production capacity of various materials were defined and quantified. Electrostatic charges on individual airborne particles and spray droplets were measured. It was demonstrated that freshly generated airborne dust particles were extensively agglomerated. The magnitude of agglomeration was a function of material type and decided the amount of dust becoming airborne from a given material. This explains why certain materials such as quartz and anthracite produce more dust than some others. It was demonstrated that surfactants could be employed to charge the spray droplets selectively. The sign and magnitude of the droplet charge was a function of surfactant type and concentration.

Cyclone emission tests were conducted on 1 D- 3 D and 2 D- 2 D cyclones with varied outlet tube sizes and inlet velocities. Talc and wheat dusts were used in testing the laboratory scale models. Data from these tests were used in developing a mathematical computer model capable of predicting outlet dust emissions given the following input variables: dust type and inlet concentration. inlet air velocity, and cyclone type. The model was developed based on the observation that a cyclone fractional efficiency curve (FEC) resembled a normal distribution's cumulative distribution function (CDF). The cut-point and sharpness-of-cut of the FEC were correlated to the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution's CDF, respectively. The model also estimated cyclone pressure drops based on given inlet velocities. Results showed that the correlation of parameters was indeed acceptable. Actual versus program generated emission concentrations were similar, with the estimated emissions being slightly higher. Actual test results showed 1 D- 3 D emission concentrations being less than 2 D- 2 D emissions under similar conditions.

A description of the structure and operation of continuous miners with flooded bed scrubbers was presented. The respirable silica <b>collection</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of wire mesh filter panels constructed using 10, 15, 20, or 30 layers of stainless steel wire mesh and of two synthetic filters were examined using both high and low capacity scrubbers with supplying air velocities of 2, 200 or 3, 500 feet per minute at the scrubber filter. The respective <b>collection</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of the 10 and 20 layer filters at the two air velocities were 58 % and 76 %, and 69 % and 84 %.

40|$|Cyclone {{separators}} {{are widely}} used in agricultural processing industries as air pollution abatement devices. The performance of cyclones {{is a function of}} the geometry of the cyclone, operating parameters, and the particle size distribution (PSD) of the entrained aerosol. Multiple models have been proposed to predict the performance of cyclones given different geometric proportions, but many of these models do not quantify changes in performance with changes in inlet velocity or cyclone diameter given fixed geometric proportions. The Texas A&M Cyclone Design (TCD) method is a simple method for designing cyclones based on an inlet design velocity. The TCD method specifies ??ideal?? inlet velocities of 975 ?? 120 m/min (3200 ?? 400 fpm) and 914 ?? 120 m/min (3000 ?? 400 fpm) for 1 D 3 D and 2 D 2 D cyclones, respectively. However, there is evidence that higher <b>dust</b> <b>collection</b> <b>efficiencies</b> may be obtained from cyclones using different inlet velocities than those specified as the ??ideal?? velocity.

The <b>dust</b> <b>collection</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of SPSS and TPSS were studied in a model experimental longwall gallery facility at Pittsburgh Research Laboratory at NIOSH (USA). The experimental design consisted of two factors: pressure, and airflow. Each factor had three levels. SPSS experiments were conducted at only one pressure (1035 kPa) which is nearly 1. 5 {{times higher than the}} highest air and water pressure for TPSS experiments. The results of the study are presented in this paper. While it appears that TPSS performed better than SPSS, the data is not sufficiently conclusive on this aspect. The differing spray characteristics of the chosen TPSS and SPSS nozzles did not allow a direct comparison of the two systems. In the TPSS arrangement, considerably greater turbulence in airflow is created around the shearer; it is likely that at least in the immediate vicinity of the tailgate drum, there is a roll back of the dust/mist cloud into the walkway. Therefore, positioning of the personnel upwind of the tailgate drum is necessary to avoid high dust exposures. The rate of decrease in concentration with TPSS is higher than that with SPSS.

With the ongoing reduction of allowable emissions, as negotiated with the Chief Air.

This however {{has the effect of}} plant operating inefficiently and a loss of revenue will result. Specifically in times of growing demand, when {{more and more of the}} currently installed generation capacity is required to satisfy the demand, forced load reductions are not desirable. Performance enhancement of ESP's can be achieved by means of system optimisation. Research was initiated to achieve the capability of modelling important dynamic aspects of ESP performance using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). This modelling capability would create the opportunity to investigate the different influencing factors which govern the <b>dust</b> <b>collection</b> <b>efficiency.</b> In the past ESP flow has been modelled by means of mathematical modelling with various degrees of success world-wide. It was found that the accuracy of flow modelling as presently carried outby researchers world wide, is not sufficient to represent the complex inlet flow. Commercially available performance simulation software is based on empirical modelling principles and do not include the complexity of flow fields and re-entrainment and thus results have been limited in accuracy. Computational fluid dynamics software is commercially available and widely used to simulate industrial flow for plant design and optimisation. This technology has been applied with increasing confidence and success in the past. However, often the physical phenomena relevant for the performance simulation of the plant is not integrated into the code and specialised user routines are created to achieve a valid performance model. This research study introduces a unique integrated simulation methodology based on a commercial CFD code. The work focuses on the accurate modelling of fluid flow and collection dynamics in an ESP.

Great {{efforts have been}} taken in underground coal mines to prevent coal workers' pneumoconiosis by controlling respirable coal dust, but respirable coal dust levels in mines still often exceed occupational exposure limits. Water-based spray systems {{are one of the}} primary dust control methods in mines; studies have suggested a potential to improve spray <b>dust</b> <b>collection</b> <b>efficiency</b> by adding surfactants. This dissertation investigates the effectiveness of different surfactant-containing sprays in capturing lab-generated monodisperse polystyrene latex particles and polydisperse coal dust by analyzing the impact of particle diameter, aerosol charging condition, surfactant type, sign and magnitude of particle charge, spray solution surface tension, spray drop size, and sign and magnitude of spray drop charge on spray collection efficiency. In order to focus on how the electrical effects caused by adding surfactants to spray water impact spray collection efficiency, the spray surface tension and drop size were taken into account during statistical modeling. Results indicate that particle size had the most important impact on respirable dust capture by water-based spray. Most particles with a diameter greater than 2 �m can be removed by the spray regardless of other factors. The magnitude of particle charge affected spray efficiency in that highly-charged particles tended to be removed more efficiently than weakly-charged particles. The magnitude and sign of the charge on surfactant-containing spray drops depended on both surfactant classification and concentration. Pure water spray drops and spray drops with nonionic (Triton X- 100) and cationic (DAH) surfactants tended to carry net positive charges on average, whereas spray drops with anionic (SDS) surfactant tended to carry a net negative charge on average. However, the magnitude of spray drop charge was independent from the concentration of surfactant in the spray water. After controlling the surface tension and drop size, test results indicated a positive correlation between the magnitude of spray drop charge and spray collection efficiency. Nonionic surfactant-containing spray performed better in capturing respirable dust than the other sprays tested here, especially for weakly-charged aerosols. This superiority {{may be due to the}} relatively low surface tension and high charge magnitude of drops containing nonionic surfactant as compared to the other sprays tested here. Although the predominant mechanisms for respirable dust capture by water-based spray are inertial impaction and interception, electrical effects are also an important factor, especially for highly-charged particles. Therefore, the electrical effects caused by adding surfactants to spray water should be a consideration for future research regarding surfactant effectiveness...|$|E
3000|$|It {{was known}} that {{overexposure}} to airborne respirable dust will cause disabling or fatal respiratory disease, and health problems of coal dust {{have been an}} ongoing occupational health concern. As far as Chinese coal mines, {{it was reported that}} there was over 2.65 million workers exposure to dust and the pneumoconiosis detection percentage was up to 7.2  %, and the number of accumulated pneumoconiosis patients had been over 57, 000 (Zheng 2011). The risks of occupational health of workers, who exposure to coal dust cloud, are directly related to coal metamorphic degree, coal dust concentration, cumulatively exposure time et al. (Naidoo et al. 2005; Belle and Phillips 2009; Onder and Yigit 2009; Qin and Liu 2009; Zhang et al. 2013). For examples, the statistical data from NIOSH (The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) indicated that: for USA underground coal mines, the pneumoconiosis detection percentage of workers exposure to coal dust had arisen from 4  % to 9  %, from 1999 to 2007, as the mining intensity increased (Hall 2008). If the pneumoconiosis detection percentage of coal workers can be kept or decreased, the key may be dust isolated and removal in working/heading face, where there usually is the highest concentration of coal dust. In terms of the problem of coal dust pollutant in two faces, the most effective method of pollutant removal may be the dust isolated (or removal) by ventilation and collection by dust catchers (Reed et al. 2004; Guo 2007; Li et al. 2007; Wei 2008; Liu et al. 2009; Liu 2011; Kuznetsov et al. 2012; Li et al. 2012; [...] Liu et al. 2012). The dust catchers employed in underground coal mines, can be classified as filtering, centrifugal separation and comprehensive system (Colinet et al. 2005; Black et al. 2007; Shorokhov et al. 2009; Koo et al., 2010; Faschingleitner and Hoflinger 2011; Torano et al. 2011; Konorev and Nesterenko 2012; Li et al. 2013). For examples, the dust catcher usually applied in German underground coal mines, is usually a fiber bag precipitator, its <b>dust</b> <b>collection</b> <b>efficiency</b> is high and the bulk is also large. In Poland, the main dust catcher is a cyclone dust collector, and its collection efficiency is up to 99.3  %, and the dewatering efficiency is also up to 98  %, but the operating resistance is over 2, 300 Pa. The collection efficiencies of the above two dust precipitators are usually higher than 95  %, but they may be not suitable for application in Chinese underground mines. Why is so? In the view of economy to technique ratio and engineering geology, the cross sectional area of heading/mining faces is usually not larger than 15  m 2, and the most part is lower than 10  m 2, especially underground coal mines in central southern and southwestern China such as Hunan, Guizhou, Yunan, etc. Therefore, the advanced dust precipitators, which are employed in Germany, Poland et al., are in too large bulk or too high operating resistance for the majority of Chinese underground coal mines. Comprehensively analyzing research progress at home and abroad, as far as Chinese underground coal mines, the shortcoming of the existing dust collector is that: (1) the efficiency of dust removal is low (about 80  %), or (2) the dewatering rate is low (lower than 85  %), or (3) the operating resistance is high (more than 2, 200  Pa), or (4) the length/width is long/wide (more than 10  m/ 2.5  m), or (5) the bulks are large.|$|E
40|$|Background: Surfactant-containing water sprays are {{commonly}} used in coal mines to collect dust. This study investigates the <b>dust</b> <b>collection</b> performance of different surfactant types {{for a range of}} coal dust particle sizes and charges. Methods: Bituminous coal dust aerosol was generated in a wind tunnel. The charge of the aerosol was either left unaltered, charge-neutralized with a neutralizer, or positively- or negatively-charged using a diffusion charger after the particles were neutralized. An anionic, cationic, or nonionic surfactant spray or a plain water spray was used to remove the particles from the air flow. Some particles were captured while passing through spray section, whereas remaining particles were charge-separated using an electrostatic classifier. Particle size and concentration of the charge-separated particles were measured using an aerodynamic particle sizer. Measurements were made with the spray on and off to calculate overall <b>collection</b> <b>efficiencies</b> (integrated across all charge levels) and efficiencies of particles with specific charge levels. Results: The diameter of the tested coal dust aerosol was 0. 89  μm ±  1. 45 [geometric mean ± geometric standard deviations (SD) ]. Respirable particle mass was collected with 75. 5  ±  5. 9 % (mean ± SD) <b>efficiency</b> overall. <b>Collection</b> <b>efficiency</b> was correlated with particle size. Surfactant type significantly impacted collection efficiency: charged particle collection by nonionic surfactant sprays was {{greater than or equal to}} collection by other sprays, especially for weakly-charged aerosols. Particle charge strength was significantly correlated with <b>collection</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Conclusion: Surfactant type affects charged particle spray <b>collection</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Nonionic surfactant sprays performed well in coal dust capture in many of the tested conditions...|$|R
