5000|$|Brassica elongata, the {{elongated}} mustard or long-stalked rape, is {{a species}} of the mustard plant that is native to parts of Central Europe, Eastern Europe, the Balkan Peninsula, the Caucasus, Morocco and parts of Central Asia. Through plant invasion this species has become naturalized in {{many other parts of}} the world. Some of these naturalized regions include South Africa, North Western Europe, Australia and North America. Given the wide range of climate and ecological conditions of these regions, B. elongata has been able to disrupt the ecosystems of their native plant habitats and has been label as an invasive species in many of its naturalized zones. In North America, this species is often found as a roadside weed in the southwestern states, particularly in the state of Nevada. Studies allude that the Cruciferae might have migrated through the Bering land bridge from what is now Central Asia. Commonly known as the long-stalked rape or as [...] in German, this species is a close cousin to Brassica napus (rapeseed) and a secondary genetic relative to B. oleracea (kale). As a close genetic species of the rapeseed, the long-stalked rape {{has one of the highest}} counts of accumulated polyunsaturated linoleic and linolenic acid.

The reason of those phenomena is the Rule of the Trade Minister Article 30 Number 16 /M-Dag/ 2013 Concerning Provisions Of <b>Horticultural</b> <b>Product</b> Import. The fresh product will be damaged if it againts the condition of label and package, and import approval. Meanwhile proccessed product will be re-exported if it againts the same rule.

30|$|Using {{agricultural}} wastes as peat substitute can benefit the waste producers, growers and the environment. Agricultural waste producers can transform the liability of waste disposal into {{a source of}} income by marketing their waste as a valuable <b>horticultural</b> <b>product</b> (Raviv 2005). Local {{agricultural wastes}} are generally less expensive for growers than peat (Raviv 2005; Restrepo et al. 2013), which is produced in cold, northern regions and must be shipped long distances to more temperate horticultural areas (Roberston 1993). Growers who use agricultural wastes as peat substitutes can market their plants as sustainable and command a higher price. Replacing peat with agricultural wastes is environmentally sound because nutrients from wastes can be recycled into plant growth thus reducing fertilizer needs and environmental impacts of peat production can be reduced by reducing the demand for peat.|$|E

40|$|Historical {{variation}} in the mineral composition of edible <b>horticultural</b> <b>products</b> was determined from UK and USA food survey data. From these data, {{it was possible to}} measure the {{variation in}} the mineral composition of edible <b>horticultural</b> <b>products</b> in general, and in edible <b>horticultural</b> <b>products</b> grouped as vegetables, fruits or nuts, in the 1930 s and in the 1980 s (or later) for both countries. Thus, the hypothesis that the mineral composition of edible <b>horticultural</b> <b>products</b> had altered since the 1930 s was tested. The average concentrations of Cu, Mg and Na in the dry matter of vegetables, and the average concentrations of Cu, Fe and K in fruits decreased significantly between the 1930 s and the 1980 s in the UK. The same hypothesis was tested with comparable data from the USA, whose historical horticultural and consumer practices have paralleled those of the UK. Data from the USA showed that the average Ca, Cu and Fe concentrations in the dry matter of vegetables, and the average concentrations of Cu, Fe and K in fruits had decreased significantly since the 1930 s. There were insufficient data to determine if the mineral composition of any single edible horticultural species had altered significantly over time either in the UK or in the USA. The nutritional implications of this study are discussed.

The results showed that soaking treatment using solution of sodium metabisulphite prior to drying process was able to maintain the dried celery leaves qualities, which resulted in higher chlorophyll content, lower apparent density, higher rehydration ratio, and higher VRS (volatile reducing substance) in comparison without soaking treatment. Moreover chlorophyll content, apparent density, volatile reducing substance (VRS), and rehydration behaviours were affected by the drying temperature. Shelf life of dried celery leaves based on critical moisture content approach represented in linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) plastic, polypropylene (PP), and aluminium foil oriented polypropylene (OPP) were 30, 51, and 790 days, respectively...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Fresh {{fruits and}} {{vegetables}} are important components of human food. However, horticultural products are highly perishable and losses can be of great importance if postharvest correct measures are not provided. There is a worldwide trend to explore new alternatives to increase storage life, giving priority to methods that reduce <b>horticultural</b> <b>product</b> decay avoiding negative effects to human heath and environment. The objective of our research was to apply environmental and human health friendly techniques to preserve fresh fruit quality through storage. Figs, apricots, oranges, pomegranates and kiwifruits were treated with sodium bicarbonate, calcium chloride, acetic acid or subjected to modified atmosphere packaging to increase their storage life with minimal quality loss, as well as damage to human health and environment. The use of these treatments and techniques gave a great performance in the reduction of fruit losses, weight loss and fruit softening. Postharvest techniques such as modified atmosphere and calcium, sodium bicarbonate and acetic acid treatments, when applied in adequate concentrations, help to keep fruit quality through storage, without damaging the environment and human health.

Modern market channels stimulate the adoptions of new technology, whereas technology adoption had few effects on modern market channel selection. In addition, shares of crop such as vegetables and fruits are soaring; surprisingly villages farther away from Beijing experienced faster crop restructuring with higher specialization. In the future we try to incorporate wholesalers or supermarkets into the analysis, which can depict a more complete picture of rural market development. Crop Production/Industries,...|$|E
