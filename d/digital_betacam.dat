40|$|With the {{transition}} to digital television now underway the primary focus by many {{has been on the}} variety of video formats and the transmission of DTV signals. But the introduction of DTV also includes six channels of CD quality sound, more commonly referred to as 5. 1 Audio, that has not received the intense scrutiny necessary for a complete transition to digital television. This paper will outline some of the many issues facing broadcasters where multichannel digital audio is concerned. A brief introduction to the AES- 3 and Dolby Digital standards, as well as some design solutions and possible scenarios for handling 5. 1 audio, will offer engineers a general template that may be used to incorporate multichannel sound into their facilities. Audio Today It is estimated that approximately 60 to 70 % of all broadcaster in the United states currently transmit 2 channels of analog audio on their NTSC allotment. Plant distribution for audio has traditionally been facilitated through the use of standard three wire cabling. Many facilities still incorporate a stereo only signal distribution which mixes down to mono at various points. The vast majority of audio acquisition, storage and playback is done using the audio channels of videotape machines. Videotape formats in those facilities vary considerably from Betacam, _ ” and SVHS to the newer <b>digital</b> formats of <b>Betacam</b> SX and DVC Pro. Often a mix of analog and AES/EBU audio is also present at those facilities. All of these VTR formats include either 2 or 4 channels of audio. Consequently most of the editing performed is also limited generally to two channels of audio with four channel production not commonly used in most broadcast applications. Transmission systems, such as microwave, satellite and TV transmitters are also typically limited to two channels of audio which are utilized as either dual mono or stereo pairs. Consumer equipment includes a wide mix of mono, stereo and Dolby 4 channel Surround Sound...|$|R

50|$|D-9 or Digital-S {{as it was}} {{originally}} known, is a professional digital video videocassette format created by JVC in 1995.

Other examples of digital video formats utilizing compression were Ampex's DCT (the first to employ such when introduced in 1992), the industry-standard DV and MiniDV (and its professional variations, Sony's DVCAM and Panasonic's DVCPRO), and Betacam SX, a lower-cost variant of <b>Digital</b> <b>Betacam</b> using MPEG-2 compression.|$|E

5000|$|MPEG IMX is a 2001 {{development}} of the <b>Digital</b> <b>Betacam</b> format. Digital video compression uses H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2 encoding at a higher bitrate than Betacam SX: 30 Mbit/s (6:1 compression), 40 Mbit/s (4:1 compression) or 50 Mbit/s (3.3:1 compression). Unlike most other MPEG-2 implementations, IMX uses intraframe compression. Additionally, IMX ensures that each frame has the same exact size in bytes to simplify recording onto video tape. Video recorded in the IMX format is compliant with CCIR 601 specification, with eight channels of audio and timecode track. It lacks an analog audio (cue) track as the <b>Digital</b> <b>Betacam,</b> but will read it as channel 7 if used for playback. This format has been standardized in SMPTE 365M and SMPTE 356M as [...] "MPEG D10 Streaming".|$|E
