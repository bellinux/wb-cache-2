25|$|Primary {{treatment}} of sewage by quiescent settling allows separation of <b>floating</b> <b>material</b> and heavy solids from liquid waste. The remaining liquid usually contains {{less than half of}} the original solids content and approximately two-thirds of the BOD in the form of colloids and dissolved organic compounds. Where nearby water bodies can rapidly dilute this liquid waste, primary treated sewage may be discharged so natural biological decomposition oxidizes remaining waste.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the primary}} {{sedimentation}} stage, sewage flows through large tanks, commonly called [...] "pre-settling basins", [...] "primary sedimentation tanks" [...] or [...] "primary clarifiers". The tanks {{are used to}} settle sludge while grease and oils rise {{to the surface and}} are skimmed off. Primary settling tanks are usually equipped with mechanically driven scrapers that continually drive the collected sludge towards a hopper in the base of the tank where it is pumped to sludge treatment facilities. Grease and oil from the <b>floating</b> <b>material</b> can sometimes be recovered for saponification (soap making).|$|E
2500|$|Secondary {{treatment}} is {{the portion of}} a sewage treatment sequence removing dissolved and colloidal compounds measured as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). [...] Secondary {{treatment is}} traditionally applied to the liquid portion of sewage after primary treatment has removed settleable solids and <b>floating</b> <b>material.</b> Secondary treatment is typically performed by indigenous, aquatic microorganisms in a managed aerobic habitat. Bacteria and protozoa consume biodegradable soluble organic contaminants (e.g. sugars, fats, and organic short-chain carbon molecules from human waste, food waste, soaps and detergent) while reproducing to form cells of biological solids. Biological oxidation processes are sensitive to temperature and, between 0°C and 40°C, the rate of biological reactions increase with temperature. Most surface aerated vessels operate at between 4°C and 32°C.|$|E

5000|$|Plastic {{pollution}} {{provides a}} more durable [...] "ship" [...] than biodegradable material for carrying the organisms over long distances. This long distance transportation can move microbes to different ecosystems and potentially introduce invasive species as well as harmful algae. The microorganisms found on the plastic debris include autotrophs, heterotrophs and symbionts. The ecosystem created by the plastisphere differs from other <b>floating</b> <b>materials</b> that naturally occur (i.e., feathers and algae) due to the slow speed of biodegradation and other different conditions.|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of the froth height in the reverse flotation of kaolinitic ore was analyzed based on the recovery by entrainment and by true flotation of iron, titanium and manganese oxides (FeO, TiO 2 and MnO). Also, the {{influence of}} the particle size in the drainage process was analyzed. The recovery by entrainment and by true flotation of the three oxides is inversely proportional to the froth height. The entrained particles are drained more easily in the froth phase than the floated particles since they are not attached to the bubbles. The recovery by entrainment and drainage of the entrained material is similar for the three oxides. However, the recovery by true flotation and drainage of the <b>floated</b> <b>material</b> is different for the three oxides. FeO has the lowest recovery, {{as a consequence of the}} minor contribution of its hydrophobic minerals, while MnO has the greatest recovery values. For the entrained material, the finest fraction is entrained more easily, but it is also drained more easily, meaning these particles have more mobility in the froth zone. For the true <b>floated</b> <b>material,</b> the finest fraction is drained more easily, indicating the greater mobility of these particles in the froth; however, the coarsest fraction is drained more easily than the two intermediate fractions, indicating the weaker attachment of the larger particles to the bubbles...|$|R

We show that this striking phenomenon is not a result of some peculiar property of ice but rather a general and robust mechanical phenomenon reproducible in the laboratory with other <b>floating</b> <b>materials.</b> We determine the theoretical relationship between {{the width of the}} resulting fingers and the material's mechanical properties and present experimental results along with field observations to support the theory. The generality of this "finger rafting" suggests that analogous processes may be responsible for creating the large-scale structures observed at the boundaries between Earth's convergent tectonic plates...|$|R

40|$|A wooden {{fishing float}} under {{immersion}} {{in water for}} long periods is liable to absorb water, the quantity of water absorbed possibly being dependent upon the physical factors like the specific gravity and the inherent property of the material, the time of soaking and the pressure acting on it.

50|$|With magnetically {{actuated}} float sensors, switching {{occurs when}} a permanent magnet sealed inside a float rises or falls to the actuation level. With a mechanically actuated float, switching {{occurs as a result}} of the movement of a float against a miniature (micro) switch. For both magnetic and mechanical float level sensors, chemical compatibility, temperature, specific gravity (density), buoyancy, and viscosity affect the selection of the stem and the float. For example, larger floats may be used with liquids with specific gravities as low as 0.5 while still maintaining buoyancy. The choice of <b>float</b> <b>material</b> is also influenced by temperature-induced changes in specific gravity and viscosity - changes that directly affect buoyancy.|$|R
50|$|There are {{numerous}} wastewater treatment technologies. A wastewater treatment train can {{consist of a}} primary clarifier system to remove solid and <b>floating</b> <b>materials,</b> a secondary treatment system consisting of an aeration basin followed by flocculation and sedimentation or an activated sludge system and a secondary clarifier, a tertiary biological nitrogen removal system, and a final disinfection process. The aeration basin/activated sludge system removes organic material by growing bacteria (activated sludge). The secondary clarifier removes the activated sludge from the water. The tertiary system, although not always included due to costs, is becoming more prevalent to remove nitrogen and phosphorus and to disinfect the water before discharge to a surface water stream or ocean outfall.|$|R

30|$|However, if the {{sea level}} rises further, it is {{possible}} that the upper essential part of the sculpture will be subjected to degradation, i.e., the face. In such a scenario, some countermeasures may be required. Conservation measures must be discussed by considering the process to remove the degradation causes rather than strengthening the object. Because the degradation area basically concurs with the average sea level during high tide, <b>floating</b> <b>materials</b> such as driftwood are considered to be one of the causes of degradation. In addition, some barriers in front of the sculpture may become an effective measure against further degradation by such causes than consolidation of the sculpture with synthetic resins. Thus, not subjective but prudent and objective consideration is required for the conservation of cultural heritage.|$|R
