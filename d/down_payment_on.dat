5|$|After {{more than}} 60 years of {{continuous}} operation, the Cacchio family {{decided to sell}} the Theatre. Rather than sell to real estate developers, the Cacchios preferred to transfer the property to the Rosendale Theatre Collective, a nonprofit formed in late 2009 {{for the sole purpose}} of buying and preserving the Theatre. The group spent months raising funds for a <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> the building, with the bulk of its money coming from small individual donations. About 60 fundraisers were held, and a large grant was provided by PepsiCo after the Theatre Collective ran a successful social networking campaign for the April 2010 Pepsi Refresh Project. The Cacchios transferred ownership of the property to the Theatre Collective on August19, 2010. Since its purchase, the Theatre has had several equipment upgrades, including a move to digital cinema.|$|E
5|$|Family Trade is an American reality {{television}} series broadcast by Game Show Network. The show premiered on March 12, 2013, {{and continued to}} air new episodes until April 16, 2013. Filmed in Middlebury, Vermont, the series chronicles the daily activities of G. Stone Motors, a GMC and Ford car dealership that employs the barter system in selling its automobiles. The dealership is operated by its founder, Gardner Stone, his son and daughter, Todd and Darcy, and General Manager Travis Romano. The series features the shop's daily interaction with its customers, who bring {{in a variety of}} items that can be resold in order to receive a <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> the vehicle they are leasing or purchasing. Commentary and narration are also often provided by the Stones during the episodes.|$|E
5|$|For {{the rest}} of his life, he {{appeared}} frequently on Phil Donahue's talk show. His celebrity crush, Alyssa Milano of the then-popular TV show Who's the Boss?, met Ryan and gave him a friendship bracelet and a kiss. Elton John loaned Jeanne White $16,500 to put toward a <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> the Cicero home, and rather than accept repayment, placed the repaid money into a college fund for Ryan's sister. In high school, White drove a red 1988 Ford Mustang GT, a gift from Michael Jackson. Despite the fame and donations, Ryan White stated that he disliked the public spotlight, loathed remarks that seemingly blamed his mother or his upbringing for his illness, and emphasized that he would be willing at any moment to trade his fame for freedom from the disease.|$|E

50|$|He {{purchased}} {{his first}} property with a $12,000 <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> in the mid-1980s, which {{was funded by}} maxing out credit cards and using some funds form a small savings account. Over a three year period, Lichtenstein reinvested capital from his properties to fund the <b>down</b> <b>payments</b> <b>on</b> more properties. The new properties were then leveraged with loans, allowing Lichtenstein to continue to add to his portfolio.|$|R
50|$|The Graceland Cemetery Association put the {{cemetery}} {{up for sale}} on June 14, 1899. But there were no immediate offers for the land. Some individuals who made <b>down</b> <b>payments</b> <b>on</b> burial plots at Graceland Cemetery were still demanding their money back. But Benjamin Meeds, {{the cemetery}} association's secretary, {{pointed out that the}} congressional legislation only allowed payments to be made to lotholders—not those who had made <b>down</b> <b>payments</b> but had never finished purchasing their lots. Meeds said he regretted that these individuals, many of them poor, would lose their <b>down</b> <b>payments.</b> But the law did not permit otherwise.|$|R
5|$|The Theatre outpaced 362 other Pepsi Refresh entrants, and was {{in first}} place {{by the middle of}} April. The RTC {{attributed}} its success in the contest to its use of social networking services, notably Facebook. The group considered moving to a digital projector with the forthcoming grant to replace the existing projector, an expected cost of $100,000. By late May, the group had won the April competition and was waiting for the Pepsi funds, before tendering a <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> the Theatre, initially planned for June10. The closing date of the sale was pushed back to allow time to finalize the deal. In mid-June, the Playback Theatre planned a benefit for the RTC in which improv actors would perform skits based on audience members' stories of experiences they had at the Theatre.|$|E
5|$|The series {{features}} customers, usually two {{to three}} per episode, bringing in anything they believe is resalable within reason to the dealership to help {{cover the cost of}} a new or used vehicle (including pigs, maple syrup, and collectable dolls), rather than paying for it with cash. The customers then negotiate the value of their items, usually with Gardner, but occasionally also {{with other members of the}} shop's staff. The trade usually is not enough to cover the full value of the car or truck; because of this, the value of the trade provides the customers with a <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> the vehicle. Once the trade is completed, Todd, Darcy, and Travis take the items the dealership has acquired and attempt to resell them for a profit.|$|E

She faced up to one year in prison, and a $100,000 fine.|$|E
25|$|Ossian Sweet {{was born}} in Florida and {{received}} a medical degree from Howard University. He practiced medicine briefly in Detroit, then continued his medical studies in Vienna and Paris before returning to Detroit in 1924 to accept a position at Dunbar Hospital. He began saving money for a home, and {{by the spring of}} the next year had saved $3500. Sweet used the $3500 as a <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> a $18,500 house located on Garland Street in east Detroit.|$|E
500|$|Nehemiah Corporation of America is a {{non-profit}} organization based in Sacramento, California specializing in homeownership, affordable housing and community development. It started in 1994 as a small organization, but grew to prominence later in the 1990s after it developed a program that allowed home buyers to make <b>down</b> <b>payments</b> <b>on</b> their purchases using funds that were derived from the home sellers. [...] This program, the Nehemiah Program, became popular and was widely emulated, giving birth to {{what came to be}} known as the seller-funded down-payment assistance industry. [...] The industry attracted criticism from U.S. federal agencies (particularly the Government Accountability Office and the Internal Revenue Service) and was ultimately shut down in 2008 by a change in federal law.|$|R
50|$|Following {{a meeting}} with a Wigan rugby league club {{representative}} at the Bush Hotel, Swansea on Sunday 28 September 1913, Swansea RFC's rugby union Half-back pairing of Sidney Jerram, and George Owens were each signed for £180 <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> (based <b>on</b> increases in average earnings, this would be approximately £61,630 in 2013), guaranteed win bonuses, and jobs for £2 per week cash.|$|R
30|$|Another {{feature of}} {{temporary}} migration concerns home ownership. Germany {{has a very}} low rate of home ownership. According to Constant et al. (2007) only 42 % of Germans own their own home compared with about 63 % of Americans. Much of this low rate is {{probably due to the}} high requirements for <b>down</b> <b>payments</b> <b>on</b> loans in Germany. These requirements can be as high as 40 % of the purchase price. Migrants, particularly temporary migrants may be expected to be much less likely to own a home than the population in general. It {{is not surprising that the}} home ownership rate for migrants is only 20 %. The authors find that migrants classified as having strong cultural attachments to German are much more likely to own their home, even if they also maintain strong attachments to their country of origin.|$|R
25|$|At {{the age of}} 22, Glass finally {{became a}} reporter, a job he had long sought, for the Lynchburg News. He rose to become the morning newspaper's editor by 1887. The {{following}} year, the publisher retired and offered Glass an option to purchase the business. Desperate to find financial backing, Glass received the unexpected assistance from a relative who loaned him enough for a $100 <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> the $13,000 deal. Free to write and publish whatever he wished, Glass wrote bold editorials and encouraged tougher reporting in the morning paper, which increased sales. Soon, Glass was able to acquire the afternoon Daily Advance, then to buy out the competing Daily Republican. Thus he became Lynchburg's sole newspaper publisher; the modern-day Lynchburg News and Advance is the successor publication to his newspapers.|$|E
25|$|Alvin Smith {{was born}} in 1798, the first {{surviving}} child of Joseph Smith Sr. and Lucy Mack Smith. During his youth, Smith worked as a carpenter’s helper to assist the Smith family in saving up sufficient funds to make a <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> a farm in Manchester Township, south of Palmyra, New York. Smith also assisted his father in clearing timber, planting wheat and tapping maple trees {{for the purpose of}} making maple sugar. A neighbor, Orlando Saunders, stated that the members of the Smith family “have all worked for me many a day; they were very good people. Young Joe (as we called him then) has worked for me, and he was a good worker; they all were.” In the early 1820s, Smith was involved with his father and brothers in a number of treasure digging excavations in the Palmyra–Manchester area.|$|E
500|$|The group {{planned to}} raise a total of $100,000 for a <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> the Theatre before a March15, 2010 deadline, raising $13,000 by December9, and {{reaching}} $25,000 by December18. New York State Assemblyman Kevin Cahill indicated support for the group in his January 2010 newsletter. Cahill had enjoyed the Theatre as a child, and urged the RTC to [...] "hang onto the vintage candy machine at all costs".|$|E
50|$|In the mid-1920s {{the city}} hoped {{to become a}} winter home for Hollywood stars. In fact, Thomas Meighan, a leading actor in silent movies, built a large home on the river in 1928 and spent the winters there. He hoped to make movies in New Port Richey. Gene Sarazen, {{one of the top}} golfers in the 1920s, also built a home in New Port Richey. He invented the modern sand wedge in a garage in New Port Richey. Other Hollywood figures such as Ed Wynn visited New Port Richey. Songwriter Irving Berlin and bandleader Paul Whiteman made <b>down</b> <b>payments</b> <b>on</b> property, but did not build homes. In 1926, a new theater named for Thomas Meighan opened, and in 1927, the Hacienda Hotel, a 55-room Spanish-style luxury hotel, was completed. Moon Lake Gardens and Dude Ranch, which {{featured}} a private game preserve of 7,000 acres, opened in the 1930s.|$|R

500|$|Newton met Holmes {{early in}} October 1975 when, the former claimed, {{he was given}} a <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> a fee of £10,000. Holmes later denied any such transaction, admitting only an {{agreement}} that Newton would carry out a frightening operation. On 12 October Newton, calling himself [...] "Peter Keene", drove to Barnstaple in a yellow Mazda car where he approached Scott, claiming to have been hired to protect Scott from a supposed Canadian hit man. This seemed plausible to Scott, who had been beaten up a few weeks earlier, and he agreed to meet [...] "Keene" [...] at a later date. However, he was sufficiently cautious to ask a friend to make a note of the stranger's car registration number.|$|E
500|$|Her family made a <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> {{their own}} home in Humboldt Park, a {{predominantly}} Puerto Rican neighborhood on Chicago's West Side when she was eleven years old. This neighborhood and its characters would later become the inspiration for Cisneros's novel The House on Mango Street. For high school, Cisneros attended Josephinum Academy, a small Catholic all-girls school. Here she found an ally in a high-school teacher who helped her to write poems about the Vietnam War. Although Cisneros had written her first poem around the age of ten, with her teacher's encouragement she became known for her writing throughout her high-school years. In high school she wrote poetry and was the literary magazine editor, but, according to herself, she did not really start writing until her first creative writing class in college in 1974. After that {{it took a while}} to find her own voice. She explains, [...] "I rejected what was at hand and emulated the voices of the poets I admired in books: big male voices like James Wright and Richard Hugo and Theodore Roethke, all wrong for me." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Tim Riggins has developed over time from an unfocused and moody alcoholic {{to a young}} man of character and dependability. Sometimes that dependability is reflected in his uncanny ability to make the wrong choices for the right reasons, which usually involve his brother. Even though he has proven his ability to help others correct their misguided choices, unfortunately there is no one who does this for Tim. In this season, his irresponsible, headstrong, but lovable brother again entices Tim into another wrong choice by convincing Tim that {{the only way they can}} make any money is by transforming their newly opened garage into a chop shop. Just as they finally end this side business and Tim has enough for the <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> a large amount of land he's been dreaming about, the police show up to arrest him at the garage. The police officers recognize Tim as [...] "number 33" [...] giving Tim no chance to deny that it's his chop shop. True to his character, he makes the decision to take the rap and allows his brother to be with his new wife and child. The season ends as Tim walks toward the jail.|$|E

This will allow Morales' company to directly import fuel oil from barges and to store far more oil in the summertime when fuel oil prices are lower. He places a large <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> of 40% <b>on</b> the property with the agreement that he will close in 30 days—if he fails to do so, the Chassidim will sell the terminal to one of Morales' competitors and keep the <b>down</b> <b>payment.</b>|$|R
40|$|This project {{considers}} the optimal design of Social Security taxes when households’ saving decisions include motives like housing, education, and uncertainty {{in addition to}} retirement. At issue is the timing, not the expected present value, of taxes over the working lifetime. A 10 -year, revenue-neutral delay in the onset of payroll taxes generates a welfare gain equal to approximately 18 percent of one year of annualized income. This is equivalent to giving a typical worker $ 8, 000 of assets upon entering the work force. Welfare gains from revenue-neutral payroll tax delays are larger when individuals must also save to overcome <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> constraints <b>on</b> housing purchases {{near the beginning of}} their work lives and slightly lower when they must save later in their work lives to finance college educations for their children...|$|R

50|$|Zoning {{laws are}} {{extremely}} restrictive in limiting {{the total amount}} of housing to be constructed in any given area. Research has shown cities and suburbs with increasingly restrictive zoning laws also have a correlation with increased segregation within those same communities and one of the leading causes for racial segregation still today https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2014/08/13/the-best-way-to-fight-inequality-in-cities-is-through-zoning/Other causes encompass overall affordability and credit ratings of the borrowers looking to buy homes for the first time.

Ugly Duckling helped customers in several ways. The company prepared tax returns and let people use their expected refunds for <b>down</b> <b>payments.</b> The company allowed people to get Visa credit cards by paying a deposit to Visa. Also, those who made <b>payments</b> <b>on</b> time could have their <b>down</b> <b>payment</b> refunded, usually 10 to 15 percent of the purchase price.
