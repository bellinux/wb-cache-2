However, {{it is known}} from many years [1] {{that it can be}} converted into a surface sensitive technique by means of the detection of the conversion electrons emitted subsequently to the nuclear de-excitation that follows the nuclear resonant absorption. Both the theoretical and experimental aspects of this variant of the technique (known as CEMS, Conversion Mössbauer Electron Spectroscopy) are well established and it has been successfully applied to the study of many different problems. One of the limitations of CEMS {{from the point of view}} of the surface analyst is that its surface sensitivity is lower than that of other standard analytical techniques such as XPS or AES. While the <b>depth</b> <b>probe</b> in these latter techniques is around 3 - 5 nm, the <b>depth</b> <b>probe</b> in CEMS is around 300 nm.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{perceive}} depth from binocular disparities the visual {{system has to}} identify matching features of the two retinal images. Normally, the assigned disparity is unambiguously determined by monocularly visible matching constraints. The assigned disparity is ambiguous when matching is unconstrained, such as when we view an isolated long oblique disparate line. Recently we found {{that in order to}} perceive a <b>depth</b> <b>probe</b> at the same depth as the oblique line, the probe needs to have the same horizontal disparity as the line (i. e. matching occurs along horizontal “search-zones” [Vis. Res. 40 (2000) 151]). Here we examined whether the <b>depth</b> <b>probe</b> disparity in unconstrained matching of long lines is influenced by cyclovergence, by cyclorotation between stereogram half-images, or by combinations of the two. We measured retinal rotation (> 6 deg in cyclovergence conditions). We found that in those conditions in which the retinal images were the same (a condition with, say, both zero cyclovergence and zero cyclorotation between the half-images, creates the same retinal images as a condition with both 6 deg cyclovergence and 6 deg cyclorotation) assigned depth was the same too, i. e. independent of cyclovergence. Thus, the assigned depth of the test-line seems to be determined solely by the retinal test-line orientation, implying that the binocular matching algorithm does not seem to incorporate the eyes’ cyclovergence when matching is unconstrained...|$|E

40|$|The depth {{sensitivity}} {{functions for}} AC amplitude, phase (PH) and DC intensity signals {{have been obtained}} in the frequency domain (where the source amplitude is modulated at radio-frequencies) by making use of analytical solutions of the photon diffusion equation in an infinite slab geometry.

40|$|Most {{spatially}} interlacing stereoscopic 3 D displays display odd {{and even}} rows {{of an image}} to either {{the left or right}} eye of the viewer. The visual system then fuses the interlaced image into a single percept. This row-based interlacing creates a small vertical disparity between the images; however, interlacing may also induce horizontal disparities, thus generating depth artifacts. Whether people perceive the depth artifacts, and if so, what is the magnitude of the artifacts, are unknown. In this study, we hypothesized and tested if people perceive interlaced edges on different depth levels. We tested oblique edge orientations ranging from 2 ◦ to 32 ◦ and pixel sizes ranging from 16 to 79 arcsec of visual angle in a <b>depth</b> <b>probe</b> experiment. Five participants viewed the visual stimuli through a stereoscope under three viewing conditions: non-interlaced, interlaced, and row-averaged (i. e., where even and odd rows are averaged). Our results indicated that people perceive depth artifacts when viewing interlaced stereoscopic images and that these depth artifacts increase with pixel size and decrease with edge orientation angle. A pixel size of 32 arcsec of visual angle still evoked depth percepts, whereas 16 arcsec did not. Row-averaging images effectively eliminated these depth artifacts. These findings have implications for display design, content production, image quality studies, and stereoscopic games and software. ...|$|E

40|$|Until recently, it was {{considered}} necessary for features in the two eyes to be matched before the evaluation of differences in their locations (binocular disparities) could reveal depth information. Motion in depth can also be perceived binocularly from related changes in the locations of matched binocular features. However, unmatched features can arise when a binocular object occludes more distant features in one eye but not the other. The presence and extent of such features can provide quantitative depth information, although perceived depth relative to geometrical predictions may vary from one such arrangement to another. The ability of humans to perceive motion in depth from unmatched stimuli has not previously been explored. Here, we use B. Gillam, S. Blackburn, and K.

40|$|The neutron {{scattering}} method for measur-ing soil water content {{has been used}} extensively in soil water studies. Its wide acceptance re-sults from the greater precision and rapidity of measurement than is possible with the gravimetric method. Additional major ad-vantages of the neutron method over other methods include measurement in a relatively large volume of soil and over {{the full range of}} soil water. As the neutron method developed, universal-ity of the calibration curve was frequently stated or implied (6, 8). As a consequence, much use of the method has been based on acceptance of one calibration curve for all mineral soils. However, a few published results indicate that the calibration for neutron depth probes may be significantly affected by the soil apart from its water content (2, 3, 5). The basis {{for the development of the}} method is the interaction of fast neutrons in the soil with hydrogen of the water molecules. Although this interaction ac-counts for the preponderance of neutron inter-actions in moist soil, the relationsip of count rate to water content can be affected by non-water hydrogen and certain chemical elements which either scatter or capture slow neutrons to some degree. A major disadvantage of the <b>depth</b> <b>probe</b> used in the neutron method has been its re-ported unsuitability for measurements near the surface.

The sport's popularity has led to an influx of commercial football centers offering organized 5, 6 and 7 -a-side leagues on third generation artificial pitches. The range of quality and maintenance of these pitches is not fully understood despite the established links between surface quality, player performance and injury. Currently researchers and manufacturers use national governing body standards as guidelines for quality; however, many commercial centers are not approved by governing bodies and therefore are not obliged to meet these criteria. In this paper we characterize the quality of 23 pitches at five, UK based, commercial football centers using portable, low cost methods including; the FIFA rotational resistance test, the Clegg Impact Hammer and an infill <b>depth</b> <b>probe.</b> This paper describes the range of qualities observed, alongside maintenance procedures and usage statistics. To the authors knowledge this is the first study that characterizes commercial football center pitches. Twenty-two of the 23 pitches met the FIFA 1 star guidelines for rotational resistance (25 - 50 Nm), however, mean Clegg Impact Hammer readings are high (208 G), suggesting surface compliance in commercial centers falls outside FIFA standards. Within pitch variance was common at all centers and was an order of magnitude higher in some pitch comparisons. These findings have two practical implications; 1) pitch quality and maintenance at commercial centers is highly variable across and within pitches, 2) the harder surfaces and the high levels of variability found in commercial football centers suggests that players require footwear researched and designed specifically for these conditions...|$|E

The negative water potential, identical to the capillary pressure, psi, below the tensiometric range (psi < - 0. 1 MPa) can be measured with thermocouple psychrometers (TP), and the volumetric water contents, theta, by means of time domain reflectometry (TDR). These standard methods were adapted for measuring the water status in a macroscopically unfissured granodiorite with a total porosity of approximately 0. 01. The measured water retention curve of granodiorite samples from the Grimsel test site (central Switzerland) exhibits a shape which is typical for bimodal pore size distributions. The measured bimodality is probably an artifact of a large surface ratio of solid/voids. The thermocouples were installed without a metallic screen using the cavity drilled into the granodiorite as a measuring chamber. The water potentials observed in a cylindrical granodiorite monolith ranged between - 0. 1 and - 3. 0 MPa; those near the wall in a ventilated tunnel between - 0. 1 and - 2. 2 MPa. Two types of three-rod TDR Probes were used, one as a <b>depth</b> <b>probe</b> inserted into the rock, the other as a surface probe using three copper stripes attached to the surface for detecting water content changes in the rock-to-air boundary. The TDR signal was smoothed with a low-pass filter, and the signal length determined based on the first derivative of the trace. Despite the low porosity of crystalline rock these standard methods are applicable to describe the unsaturated zone in solid rock and may also be used in other consolidated materials such as concrete...|$|E
40|$|Higher {{incidence}} of oral cancer and precancer in Indian population necessitates in <b>depth</b> <b>probing</b> of various etiological and contributory factors for its early diagnosis and prognosis. In {{the present study}} serum iron, copper, zinc levels and Cu/zn ratio were estimated in control and study groups [oral leukoplakia (OL), oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF), oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) ]. Estimation of these trace elements was done by colorimetric method using semi automated analyzer. Serum iron level and Cu/Zn ratio were significantly reduced while serum copper was increased significantly in OL, OSMF, and OSCC. The comparison of these trace elements between study groups was also found to be significant. Thus, assessment of Cu, Zn, Fe and Cu/Zn ratio {{can be used as}} auxiliary test to clinicopathological diagnosis and prognosis of oral precancer and cancer...|$|R
40|$|This {{clinical}} investigation examined {{the effect of}} a single subgingival irrigation of chlorhexidine 0. 2 % or sanguinarine on gingivitis affecting orthodontically banded first molars in adolescent patients. Eighteen patients with gingivitis participated in the study. <b>Probing</b> <b>depth,</b> papilla bleeding index and plaque index were recorded at four sites for three molars at baseline, 2 weeks and 4 weeks by one investigator. A second investigator irrigated a single application of 3 ml of either chlorhexidine, sanguinarine or saline. The gingival bleeding as determined by papilla bleeding index was almost eliminated in the 4 week period. A reduction of the plaque index and <b>probing</b> <b>depth</b> was observed in all three groups. A significant difference related to <b>probing</b> <b>depth</b> between the effect of saline and chlorhexidine (p < 0. 01) was noted. King Saud Universit...|$|R
50|$|The {{junctional}} epithelium (JE) is that epithelium {{which lies}} at, and in health also defines, {{the base of}} the gingival sulcus. The <b>probing</b> <b>depth</b> of the gingival sulcus is measured by a calibrated periodontal probe. In a healthy-case scenario, the probe is gently inserted, slides by the sulcular epithelium (SE), and is stopped by the epithelial attachment (EA). However, the <b>probing</b> <b>depth</b> of the gingival sulcus may be considerably different from the true histological gingival sulcus depth.|$|R
