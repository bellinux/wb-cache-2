5|$|It was the Ottomans' {{skill with}} {{dealing with their}} opponents that made them very {{powerful}} very quickly. They would subjugate their opponents as vassals rather than destroy them, otherwise they would have exhausted themselves in the process. The exacting of tribute from conquered states {{in the form of}} children and money was effective in forcing subjugation over conquest. Coupled with this, the entire region was composed of many states (Bulgaria, Serbia, Latin states) who would <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> fight each other as the Ottomans and realized too late that the Ottoman forces defeated them by integrating them in a network of subordinate states.|$|E
5|$|The massive {{influx of}} prospectors drove the {{formation}} of boom towns along the routes of the stampede, with Dawson City in the Klondike the largest. The new towns were crowded, often chaotic and many disappeared <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> as they came. Most stampeders were men but women also travelled to the region, typically as {{the wife of a}} prospector. Some women entertained in gambling and dance halls built by business men and women who were encouraged by the lavish spending of successful miners.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand won the toss {{and elected}} to bat, {{immediately}} demonstrating a reshuffling of their batting order, with Guptill facing the first ball from Anderson, presumably to protect Ronchi, who fell so {{quickly in the}} previous match. However, Ronchi was soon on strike and <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> {{on his way back}} to the pavilion, Anderson clean-bowling him with the last ball of the third over. Guptill was almost out himself on 13 in the 10th over, but his low pull shot was dropped by Trott at midwicket. It was a mistake that would prove costly for England, as Guptill went on to put on successive 100-run stands for the second and third wickets with Williamson (55) and Taylor (60) on his way to a New Zealand record 189 not out off 155 balls. Captain Brendon McCullum put on 40 runs himself to close out New Zealand's 50 overs with the team on 359/3.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Daniels {{signed the}} Healthy Indiana Plan, which {{provided}} 132,000 uninsured Indiana workers with coverage. The program works by helping its beneficiaries purchase a {{private health insurance}} policy with a subsidy from the state. The plan promotes health screenings, early prevention services, and smoking cessation. It also provides tax credits for small businesses that create qualified wellness and Section 125 plans. The plan was paid for {{by an increase in}} the state’s tax on cigarettes and the reallocation of federal Medicaid funds through a special waiver granted by the federal government. In a September 15, 2007 Wall Street Journal column, Daniels was quoted as saying about the Healthy Indiana Plan and cigarette tax increase saying, “A consumption tax on a product you'd <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> have less of doesn't violate the rules I learned under Ronald Reagan." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Ray Rhodes {{directed}} the episode {{as part of}} a deal with The Bronx Zoo, another television show filmed at Paramount Studios. Rhodes had previously won Emmy Awards on four occasions for his work on the television series Insights between 1981 and 1984. Wil Wheaton later recalled that there were some issues between the main cast and the director, but didn't know what they were about as he only worked for one day of the shoot. Gates McFadden described it as [...] "one of the most sexist episodes we ever had", and Patrick Stewart sought to have the episode changed to reduce those elements. Some of the production crew subsequently thought poorly of [...] "Angel One". Executive producer Maurice Hurley described it as [...] "Terrible. Just terrible. One of the ones you'd <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> erase". Producer Herbert Wright felt that the [...] "sexual places it was dragged to were absurd".|$|E

500|$|Patti Smith {{had a great}} {{influence}} on Iyall. [...] " [...] someone who was both a rock singer and a poet," [...] she said. [...] "She combined things I was interested in. Plus, she wasn't a trumped-up sex symbol. She was herself on stage. That appealed to me. It looked like something I could do. You didn't have to look {{like all the other}} singers." [...] Iyall was highly critical of the music of the day and found inspiration in other mediums. [...] "I hate rock and roll right now. It's turned into some new kind of stupid [...] religion... I'd rather listen to Billie Holiday, maybe Tom Waits. [...] Actually, I'll admit I like The Bangles – they have a great sound.

2500|$|As for the 26th of July 2011, it {{was planned}} to {{interrogate}} 38 witnesses for [...] "the part of prosecution". The judge Kireyev gave admission to witness, for the Tymoshenko part, to just two people (out of 33 claimed) - Alexander Turchinov and Michail Lyvinsky. However even [...] "witnesses {{for the prosecution}} part" [...] were testifying, mainly, in favour of Tymoshenko. As a result, Tymoshenko wrote in her Twitter: [...] "Kireyev was banned to call “our” witnesses, he got rebuked even for “theirs” (i.e. witnesses from prosecution)". On July, the 26th, 2011, i.e. <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> as the process of witnessing started, direct teletransmitting from the trial room stopped.|$|E
2500|$|John Younger {{was almost}} arrested in Dallas County, Texas in January 1871. He killed two lawmen during the attempt and escaped. On June 3, 1871, the gang robbed {{a bank in}} Corydon, Iowa; the James and Younger {{brothers}} were suspects. The bank contacted the Pinkerton National Detective Agency in Chicago, the first involvement of the famous agency {{in the pursuit of}} the James–Younger Gang. Agency founder Allan Pinkerton dispatched his son, Robert Pinkerton, who joined a county sheriff in tracking the gang to a farm in Civil Bend, Missouri. A short gunfight ended indecisively as the gang escaped. On June 24, Jesse James {{wrote a letter to the}} Kansas City Times, claiming Republicans were persecuting him for his Confederate loyalties by accusing him and Frank of carrying out the robberies.

2500|$|It {{has been}} written that male guardians such as fathers and husbands did not consent to their wives or daughters being {{examined}} by male practitioners unless absolutely necessary in life or death circumstances. The male guardians would <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> treat their women themselves or have them be seen by female practitioners {{for the sake of}} privacy. The women similarly felt the same way; such is the case with pregnancy and the accompanying processes such as child birth and breastfeeding, which were solely reliant upon advice given by other women. The role of women as practitioners appears in a number of works despite the male dominance within the medical field. Two female physicians from Ibn Zuhr's family served the Almohad ruler Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur in the 12th century. Later in the 15th century, female surgeons were illustrated {{for the first time in}} Şerafeddin Sabuncuoğlu's Cerrahiyyetu'l-Haniyye (Imperial Surgery). Treatment provided to women by men was justified to some by prophetic medicine (al-tibba alnabawi), otherwise known as [...] "medicine of the prophet" [...] (tibb al-nabi), which provided the argument that men can treat women, and women men, even if this means they must expose the patient's genitals in necessary circumstances.|$|E
2500|$|Falwell {{condemned}} homosexuality as {{forbidden by}} the Bible. Gay rights groups called Falwell an [...] "agent of intolerance" [...] and [...] "the {{founder of the}} anti-gay industry" [...] for statements he had made and for campaigning against LGBT social movements. Falwell supported Anita Bryant's 1977 [...] "Save Our Children" [...] campaign to overturn a Florida ordinance prohibiting {{discrimination on the basis}} of sexual orientation and a similar movement in California. In urging the repeal of the ordinance, Falwell told one crowd, [...] "Gay folks would <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> kill you as look at you." [...] When the LGBT-friendly Metropolitan Community Church was almost accepted into the World Council of Churches, Falwell called them [...] "brute beasts" [...] and stated, [...] "this vile and satanic system will one day be utterly annihilated and there'll be a celebration in heaven." [...] He later denied this. Falwell also regularly linked the AIDS pandemic to LGBT issues and stated, [...] "AIDS is not just God's punishment for homosexuals, it is God's punishment for the society that tolerates homosexuals." [...] Amongst many remarks over the years he is probably most known for statements attributed to him about a Teletubby being a homosexual role model for homosexual recruitment and stating that LGBT organizations angered God, thereby in part causing God to let the September 11 attacks happen.|$|E
2500|$|Unferth {{is portrayed}} by John Malkovich. Malkovich became {{involved}} in the project because one of his friends, who had worked with Zemeckis, [...] "spoke very highly of him. I had always found him a very interesting and innovative filmmaker. I liked the script very much and I liked the group involved and the process interested me a great deal also." [...] He found the experience of working with motion capture to be similar to his experiences working in the theater. He also found the process intriguing: [...] "Say you do a normal day of filmmaking. Sometimes that’s 1/8 of a page, sometimes it’s 3/8th of a page, normally let’s say it’s 2½ pages, maybe 3. Now it’s probably a little more {{than it used to be}} but not always. So you may be acting for a total of 20 minutes a day. In this, you act the entire day all the time except for the tiny amount of time it takes them to sort of coordinate the computer information, let’s say, and make sure that the computers are reading the data and that you’re transmitting the data. It interests me on that level because I’m a professional actor so I’d <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>soon</b> act as sit around." [...] Malkovich also recalled that he studied the original poem in high school, and that “I think we got smacked if we couldn’t recite a certain number of stanzas. It was in the Old English class and I think my rendition was exemplary." ...|$|E

Examination of the obesity problem and past public service advertising, behavior change models, and effective message development create opportunities for society to be better served by public service marketing efforts, both in general and specifically concerning obesity.
