5000|$|The {{change of}} air cooling to liquid cooling {{occurred}} {{at the start of}} World War II when the US military needed reliable vehicles. The subject of boiling engines was addressed, researched, and a solution found. Previous radiators and engine blocks were properly designed and survived <b>durability</b> <b>tests,</b> but used water pumps with a leaky graphite-lubricated [...] "rope" [...] seal (gland) on the pump shaft. The seal was inherited from steam engines, where water loss is accepted, since steam engines already expend large volumes of water. Because the pump seal leaked mainly when the pump was running and the engine was hot, the water loss evaporated inconspicuously, leaving at best a small rusty trace when the engine stopped and cooled, thereby not revealing significant water loss. Automobile radiators (or heat exchangers) have an outlet that feeds cooled water to the engine and the engine has an outlet that feeds heated water {{to the top of the}} radiator. Water circulation is aided by a rotary pump that has only a slight effect, having to work over such a wide range of speeds that its impeller has only a minimal effect as a pump. While running, the leaking pump seal drained cooling water to a level where the pump could no longer return water to the top of the radiator, so water circulation ceased and water in the engine boiled. However, since water loss led to overheat and further water loss from boil-over, the original water loss was hidden.|$|E

This engine {{has the potential}} for use in high output peakshaving or chiller applications. Initially, engine performance was to be measured on both engines, followed by a 100 -hour <b>durability</b> <b>test</b> of the first engine and 500 -hour <b>durability</b> <b>test</b> on the second 502 engine. Power, efficiency, blowby, oil consumption, oil degradation, plug erosion, and valve recession were recorded during <b>durability</b> <b>testing.</b> Maintenance was performed as needed and recorded. The planned 1000 -hour <b>durability</b> <b>test</b> of the first GM 502 engine was aborted due to excessive oil consumption. Prior to testing the second engine, the piston assemblies were replaced with newly designed pistons, but the engine still demonstrated high oil consumption. The oil consumption was decreased by replacing the second compression rings of the newly designed pistons with a taper-faced oil-scraper desing.

About 90 per cent of candidates come from other branches of the police and the National Guard, while the rest are military. The military candidates that pass selection must also complete a six-month course on jurisprudence. The maximum age for selection is 26 years and candidates are expected to have been members of their respective previous units for no less than two years. The first two weeks are called the [...] "shake-down", in which almost everyone takes part. Only the negotiators and part of the logistics group (not including drivers) are exempted. Candidates undergo long and complicated psychological and <b>durability</b> <b>tests</b> designed to weed out weaker applicants. [...] "Shake-down" [...] is harsh, consisting of forced marches in full combat gear. True to their SAS origins, the operatives must carry a 35 kg (77 lb) backpack, AK-47 with eight full magazines, handgun and magazines, knives, gas mask, and radio. Their training routes take part in the worst weather, in some of the toughest terrain that Albania has to offer: in the northeastern mountain range (the highest peak is Korabi, at 2,751 metres (9,025 feet)), the marshes of Vlora, and the swamps of Durrës and Lezha. Approximately 75 per cent of the candidates fail at this initial phase. The last day is reserved for infiltration tests.
