Frogs, fetal pigs, perch, cats, earthworms, grasshoppers, crayfish and starfish are commonly used <b>in</b> <b>classroom</b> dissections. Alternatives {{to the use of}} animals <b>in</b> <b>classroom</b> dissections are widely used, with many U.S. States and school districts mandating students be offered the choice to not dissect. Citing the wide availability of alternatives and the decimation of local frog species, India banned dissections in 2014.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Obergruppenführer Wilhelm Bittrich's II SS Panzer Corps—comprising {{the remains}} of Walter Harzer's 9th SS and Heinz Harmel's 10th SS Panzer Divisions—had moved into the area north of Arnhem to refit and reorganise. Although badly mauled after {{escaping}} the Falaise pocket, the Korps {{was made up of}} seasoned veterans and made available significantly more forces to the Germans than the allies had been led to expect. The divisions were also specially trained in anti-airborne operations; during their formation both divisions had undergone month-long anti airborne exercises whilst waiting for their heavy equipment, and had also spent the last 15 months studying the best reactions to a parachute attack <b>in</b> <b>classroom</b> and field exercises. The 9th SS had a Panzergrenadier brigade, a reconnaissance battalion, an artillery battalion, two batteries of self-propelled guns and a company of tanks. Exactly how many men were available after the withdrawal from Normandy is unclear. Some sources suggest that the 9th had up to 6,000 men, others suggest that the combined total of the 9th and 10th SS was only 6,000–7,000 men.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} and other executive function skills {{are crucial to}} success both <b>in</b> <b>classroom</b> settings and life. A study examining the impact of cognitive intervention for at-risk children in preschool classrooms found that children who received such intervention for {{one to two years}} significantly outperformed their peers. Compared to same-age children who were randomly assigned to the control condition (a literacy unit developed by the school district), preschoolers who received intervention achieved accuracy scores of 85% on tests of inhibitory control (self-discipline), cognitive flexibility, and working memory. Their peers in the control (no intervention) condition, on the other hand, demonstrated only 65% accuracy. Educators involved in this study ultimately opted to implement the cognitive skills training techniques instead of the district-developed curriculum.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{heating period}} is very long in Harbin in China. This paper {{describes}} a field study <b>in</b> university <b>classrooms</b> and dormitories <b>in</b> heating period in Harbin. The survey {{shows that the}} neutral temperature <b>in</b> <b>classrooms</b> at 3 periods was 17. 7 ̊C, 19. 3 ̊C and 19. 4 ̊C, and in dormitories the neutral thermal temperatures were 20. 9 ̊C, 21. 8 ̊C and 21. 2 ̊C, respectively. The neutral temperatures were on the rising trend, which reflected human thermal adaptation to the heating environment. The different neutral temperatures <b>in</b> <b>classrooms</b> and dormitories were mainly caused by 2 aspects: Classrooms were warmer than dormitories, so more students could not accept classroom environment psychologically; Students have different regulative methods to the indoor environment. Clothing insulation <b>in</b> <b>classrooms</b> was bigger than in dormitories. Because of above reasons, students felt more comfortable in dormitories than <b>in</b> <b>classrooms...</b>|$|R

Their friendship develops in several short stories in which, throughout her childhood, he nurtures Asumi's interest in space. As her interest and dreams grow, Asumi is often ridiculed by classmates, especially because she immerses herself in books about space and rarely engages <b>in</b> <b>classroom</b> activities. When she decides to apply for admission to the Tokyo Space Academy, her teachers urge her to reconsider because she is below average height.

5|$|The normal {{progress}} for an able Magister {{was to go}} on to further study in one of the four faculties at Leuven: Theology, Medicine, Canon Law and Roman Law. Gisbert might have hoped that Mercator would go further in theology and train for the priesthood but Mercator did not: like many twenty year old young men he was having his first serious doubts. The problem was the contradiction between the authority of Aristotle and his own biblical study and scientific observations, particularly in relation to the creation and description of the world. Such doubt was heresy at the University and {{it is quite possible that}} he had already said enough <b>in</b> <b>classroom</b> disputations to come to the notice of the authorities: fortunately he did not put his sentiments into print. He left Leuven for Antwerp, there to devote his time to contemplation of philosophy. This period of his life is clouded in uncertainty. He certainly read widely but only succeeded in uncovering more contradictions between the world of the Bible and the world of geography, a hiatus which would occupy him for the rest of his life. He certainly could not effect a reconciliation between his studies and the world of Aristotle.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ed.

The focus of the study was to find ways in which technology can be used as a means to motivate students to interact with each other and with the learning activities <b>in</b> <b>classrooms.</b> Keller's motivational theory (2008) and its components (Attention, Relevance, Satisfaction, Confidence) provided the theory to address the relationship between technology and student interest <b>in</b> the <b>classroom.</b> The study was conducted in Nizwa College of Technology, Nizwa, Oman. The participants were 600 students and 30 instructors. Four surveys were used in this study; three of them were given to the students and one was given to the instructors. The findings supported Keller's motivational theory and its components regarding using technology to motivate students to interact with their instructors, with the learning activities, and with each other. There was a significant correlation between using technology <b>in</b> <b>classrooms</b> and gaining students' attention. There was a significant correlation between using technology and the relevance of the material presented <b>in</b> <b>classrooms</b> and students' real life. There was a significant correlation between using technology and students' confidence <b>in</b> participating <b>in</b> <b>classrooms</b> using technology. There was a significant correlation between using technology and students' satisfaction with the material presented <b>in</b> <b>classrooms.</b> To address students' motivation <b>in</b> <b>classrooms,</b> Keller (2001, 2008) posited that these four categories (Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction [ARCS]) operated together to motivate students to interact <b>in</b> the <b>classroom.</b> ARCS was significantly correlated with students' learning experiences, students' learning strategies, and computer use in course...|$|R

25|$|Instructional design, the {{systematic}} design of materials, activities and interactive environments for learning, is broadly informed by educational psychology theories and research. For example, in defining learning goals or objectives, instructional designers often use a taxonomy of educational objectives created by Benjamin Bloom and colleagues. Bloom also researched mastery learning, an instructional strategy in which learners only advance {{to a new}} learning objective after they have mastered its prerequisite objectives. Bloom discovered {{that a combination of}} mastery learning with one-to-one tutoring is highly effective, producing learning outcomes far exceeding those normally achieved <b>in</b> <b>classroom</b> instruction. Gagné, another psychologist, had earlier developed an influential method of task analysis in which a terminal learning goal is expanded into a hierarchy of learning objectives connected by prerequisite relationships.|$|E
