5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of Nødnett, Norway had three separate systems for telecommunications within the police, fire departments and paramedics, all based on analog radio. The old system had two main downsides: it was not encrypted, and it prevented communication between agencies. This was particularly problematic in larger disasters and accidents, and in instances where criminals listened to the police radio during police actions. The Norwegian <b>Data</b> <b>Inspectorate</b> had also instructed the agencies to encrypt their communications for reasons of privacy. This would either have to be done through an expensive upgrade to the existing systems, or through the construction of a new, digital network.|$|E

5|$|Two {{parallel}} investigations were undertaken, one by HSL {{and one by}} Namdal Police District. The latter criticized the former because there were not given access to the cockpit voice recorder (CVR). Since 1989 both {{the police and the}} prosecuting authority had not been represented in the accident investigations. HSL emphasized that they had no legal obligation to submit the tapes to the police, that the police had not asked for the tapes after Widerøe Flight 839 in 1990 and that the Ministry of Transport and Communications supported this line. The reason for the rules was that the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association did not want the records from the CVR to be used in criminal cases against pilots. The investigation board stated that they would forward any information which supported criminal violations, while Namdal Police District stated that it was necessary for an independent police investigation to identify any criminal violations. The Norwegian <b>Data</b> <b>Inspectorate's</b> director Georg Apenes supported the police in their request for the tapes.|$|R

40|$|The {{efficiency}} {{of the labor market}} critically depends on the design of its institutions, including employment protection legislation. However, since formal laws can be observed to varying degrees, the actual enforcement regime shapes incentives and constraints. Most of the studies exploring the effects of employment protection on labor market performance implicitly assume that compliance is near to complete.

40|$|The lack of {{protection}} for prospective homeowners from inferior workmanship in homebuilding {{has led the}} South African government to introduce legislation that give inspectors powers to enforce compliance with building regulations {{in order to address}} this shortcoming. In spite of this endeavor the home building industry still produces houses built with many structural problems caused by poor workmanship. The National Home Building Registration Council (NHBRC) has spent large sums annually on remedial works. It is against this background that this research project has been conducted. The study sought to establish criteria necessary for and barriers to an effective inspectorate function in the South African home building industry. Both qualitative and quantitative research methods were used for the study, including interviews, and knowledge, attitudes, and perception (KAP) surveys of relevant stakeholders such as inspectors and homebuilders. The study presents the perceptions and opinions of building contractors on their interactions with building inspectors in the housing industry. The study demonstrates that having dealings with the inspectorate at various levels does not necessarily mean that, for example, newly constructed houses will be inspected on a more regular basis. The findings of this study provide baseline <b>data</b> for <b>inspectorate</b> departments and researchers, thereby contributing to understanding the importance of an effective inspectorate in the homebuilding industry. The primary study conclusion is that homebuilding contractors do not have regard for the competence and levels of knowledge of inspectors given that these are evidently lacking. The preferred characteristics of inspectors were helpfulness, trustworthiness, fairness and being knowledgeable and thorough. It is clear that one of the major challenges facing the home building inspectorate in South Africa is the lack of competent and knowledgeable inspectors to insure adherence to the National Building Regulations and specifications by building contractors. Considering that the majority of South African contractor in the housing sector are emerging contractors it is imperative that the inspectorate play a developmental role by providing them with useful advice more frequently than is currently the case. If continuous training on technical maters of both inspectors and contractors is applied the desired quality standards and workmanship in the homebuilding industry can be attained...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{views of}} Moral therapy were {{introduced}} into lunatic asylums in the 19 th century. In 1850, The Central Criminal Lunatic Asylum (CCLA) opened in Dublin {{as the first}} forensic psychiatric hospital in Europe (Now called ‘The Central Mental Hospital’). The foundations of the profession of occupational therapy and moral treatment have been well established (Peloquin 1989). Towards {{the last quarter of}} the 19 h century, the concept of moral treatment declined and this impacted on the availability of leisure occupations in asylums. Objectives: To explore the Inspectors in Lunacy Reports on the CCLA from 1890 - 1910. To identify how the decline in moral treatment during this period affected the opportunity for patients to engage in leisure occupations. To identify what leisure occupations patients continued to participate in. Methods: Historical documentary research methods were used to gather <b>data</b> from the <b>Inspectorate</b> in Lunacy Reports from 1890 - 1910. The documents were analysed thematically (Braun and Clarke 2006) and explored how the decline in moral treatment impacted on patients’ leisure occupations. Results: The decline in moral treatment in the latter part of the 19 th Century resulted in diminished opportunity for patients to engage in leisure occupations. Despite this, the reports revealed patients continued to enjoy a variety of leisure occupations including sports, reading, religion, concerts and music. Conclusions: The therapeutic use of occupation remained important in promoting positive health and well-being at the CCLA despite the demise in moral therapy. The benefits of en-gaging individuals in meaningful and purposeful occupations remain core beliefs in Occupa-tional Therapy today...|$|R

40|$|The growing {{impact of}} {{information}} and communication technologies has resulted in the establishment of data protection authorities across Europe. Despite the role of these bodies as enforcers of privacy and data protection legislation, Surveillance Studies has so far offered little attention to their role in resistance. Based on a critical socio-legal examination of the Norwegian <b>Data</b> <b>Inspectorate,</b> the focus of this article is on the role of data protection authorities in resisting surveillance and threats to privacy and data protection. More specifically, the article asks what power the Norwegian <b>Data</b> <b>Inspectorate</b> has to achieve genuine resistance, and how its institutional structure affects this capability. Through a three-pronged analysis consisting of (i) institutional mapping, (ii) a typology of resistance strategies, and (iii) a review of its role in the Norwegian public debate on the EU Data Retention Directive, the article addresses the fundamental tension inherent in the Norwegian <b>Data</b> <b>Inspectorate</b> as a privacy-advocating ombudsman and an administrative body.
