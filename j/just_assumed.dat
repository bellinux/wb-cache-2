He also reportedly gave them inconsistent answers to questions about when he had seen the Hyundai parked outside the apartment.|$|E

25|$|The Mark 6's contact {{exploder}} mechanism {{descended from}} the Mark 3 contact exploder. Both exploders had the unusual feature that the firing pin's travel was perpendicular to the torpedo's travel, so the firing pin {{would be subject to}} side loading when the torpedo struck its target. The Mark 3 exploder was designed when torpedo speeds were much slower (the Mark 10 torpedo's speed was 30 knots), but even then the Mark 3 prototypes had problems with the firing pin binding during the high deceleration when the torpedo collided with the target. The solution was to use a stronger firing spring to overcome the binding. The Mark 14 torpedo had a much higher speed (46 knots), so it would see significantly higher deceleration, but BuOrd apparently <b>just</b> <b>assumed</b> the contact exploder would work at the higher speed. There were no live-fire tests of the Mark 14 torpedo, so there were no-live fire tests of its contact exploder. If BuOrd had tried some live-fire tests of the contact exploder during peacetime, it probably would have experienced some duds and rediscovered the binding problem.|$|E

In terms of that [...] has very few of those now." [...] Jonathan Hughes, editor of All About Soap magazine, added [...] " [...] an absolute legend... You can't imagine the show without her...

500|$|In 1965, Warner {{surprised}} many industry observers when {{he purchased}} {{the rights to}} Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Edward Albee's searing play about a destructive marriage. [...] From the beginning, the project was beset by controversy. Ernest Lehman's script, which was extremely faithful to Albee's play, stretched the U.S. film industry's Production Code to the limit. [...] Jack Valenti, who <b>just</b> <b>assumed</b> leadership of the Motion Picture Association of America, recalled that a meeting with Warner and studio aide Ben Kalmenson left him [...] "uneasy". [...] "I was uncomfortable {{with the thought that}} this was just the beginning of an unsettling new era in film, in which we would lurch from crisis to crisis without any suitable solution in sight," [...] Valenti wrote. Meanwhile, Lehman and the film's director, Mike Nichols, battled with studio executives and exhibitors who insisted that the film be shot in color rather than black and white. [...] These controversies soon faded into the background while Jack Warner challenged the validity of the production code by publicly requiring theaters showing the film to post an [...] "Adults only" [...] label and restrict tickets sales accordingly, all as a marketing tease to entice audiences to see what warranted that restriction. At this, the MPAA — wary of a repeat of the embarrassment it had trying to censor the highly acclaimed film, The Pawnbroker — gave in and approved the film as a special exception because of its quality, which led to other filmmakers to challenge the code themselves even more aggressively. Upon its release, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? was embraced by audiences and critics alike. [...] It secured 13 nominations from the Academy including one for Best Picture of 1966.|$|E

[...] The character has also received positive attention from feminist critics; in her article [...] "12 Life Lessons 'Kim Possible' Taught Us That Are Still Pretty Relevant", Kadeen Griffiths of Bustle described Kim as an [...] "amazingly feminist" [...] character [...] "that taught girls that it was okay to overachieve, that worrying about boys didn't make you any less of a hero, and that you could invent your own slang and still sound (sort of) cool." [...] Griffiths went on to hail the character as [...] "our cartoon idol when it came to reaching for the stars and pulling it off flawlessly", concluding, [...] "at {{the end of the day}} Kim Possible could do anything.

[...] BuzzFeed ranked Kim ninth on its list of [...] "17 Characters From Your Childhood That Were More Feminist Than You Remember", with author Ellie Bate crediting the character with [...] "break the sexist stereotype that all cheerleaders are nothing but bimbos".

The newest superhero on the block doesn't need a gimmicky mask or a jolt of testosterone to get the job done ... Kim Possible is ready and able to rescue humankind from evildoers without sacrificing her interest in boys and clothes." [...] However, in her book Girlfighting: Betrayal and Rejection, author Lyn Mikel Brown dismissed Kim as both a feminist and role model because of her alleged reliance on Ron's intelligence, as well as the observation that [...] "Her biggest threat is not evil, in fact, but the head cheerleader". Since her debut, Kim has proven herself a popular character among both girls and boys, although McCorkle admitted that [...] "whenever you have a girl in the lead doing all the action stuff, there’s a certain age group of boys who won’t admit they like the stuff.

[...] McCorkle recalled an incident in which a fan of the show was very much surprised to learn that the writers were actually men upon meeting them; the fan had always <b>just</b> <b>assumed</b> that they were both young women because of the way in which they characterized Kim.
