2500|$|In February 2013 {{a federal}} court {{rejected}} two tax shelter transactions entered into by Dow that created approximately $1 billion in tax deductions between 1993–2003. In the stated opinion, the Court termed the transactions [...] "schemes that were designed to exploit perceived weaknesses {{in the tax code}} and not designed for legitimate business reasons." [...] The schemes were created by Goldman Sachs and the law firm of King & Spalding, and involved creating a partnership that Dow operated out of its European headquarters in Switzerland. [...] Dow stated that it had paid all tax assessments with interest. The case was a lawsuit against the Internal Revenue Service seeking a refund of the taxes paid. The case was appealed to the 5th Circuit court, where Dow's claims were again rejected. [...] Dow has petitioned for an en banc hearing by the 5th Circuit, arguing that the decision was contrary to <b>established</b> <b>case</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E

50|$|Generally speaking, higher courts do {{not have}} direct {{oversight}} over the lower courts of record, in that they cannot reach {{out on their own}} initiative (sua sponte) at any time to overrule judgments of the lower courts.

5000|$|The {{potential}} {{effect of the}} decision is, as two commentators noted, <b>Established</b> <b>case</b> <b>law</b> is that when considering whether a proposal is [...] "contrary to the objectives and policies" [...] of a relevant plan, the objectives and policies of the plan as a whole are considered, although individual objectives and policies can have significant weight (such as a restriction on urban activities in a rural zone). The Supreme Court decision may expand the circumstances when a proposal {{is considered to be}} contrary to the objectives and policies of the plan if it is clearly contrary to a specific and directive objective or policy.|$|E
5000|$|Despite the {{extensive}} codifications the fundamental doctrine of precedent found in common law still applies.

40|$|The {{different}} {{role played}} by <b>case</b> <b>law</b> and the historical and conceptual differences between the doctrines of precedent in common law and civil law traditions are important determinants of judicial creativity. In this article we consider a hybrid version of stare decisis, called with the French name of jurisprudence constante, adopted by mixed jurisdictions. Unlike stare decisis which allows a single precedent to <b>establish</b> <b>case</b> <b>law,</b> the doctrine of jurisprudence constante links the recognition of a judge-made rule {{to the existence of}} a consecutive line of decisions affirming the same legal principle. We develop a model to consider the effects of this doctrine on the social costs arising from judicial error and uncertainty in <b>case</b> <b>law.</b> We further consider the effects of these alternative doctrines of precedent on judicial creativity and ideological bias in judge-made law...|$|R
5000|$|For {{criminal}} law, {{the independent}} Hoge Raad {{is the highest}} court of the Netherlands, as well as Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten. The Court was established on 1 October 1838 and sits in The Hague, Netherlands. The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is limited primarily to civil, criminal and tax-related cases. The Court {{has the authority to}} overturn rulings by appellate courts (...) and therefore <b>establishes</b> <b>case</b> <b>law,</b> but only if the lower court applied the law incorrectly or the ruling lacks sufficient reasoning, facts are no longer subject of discussion. The Court may not rule on the constitutionality of laws passed by the States-General and treaties. Hence the Netherlands has no constitutional court.|$|R

50|$|Protocol 14 {{amended the}} Convention so that judges would be elected for a non-renewable term of nine years, whereas {{previously}} judges served a six-year term with {{the option of}} renewal. Amendments were also made so that a single judge could reject plainly inadmissible applications, while prior to this protocol only a three judge committee could make this final decision. In cases of doubt, the single judge refers the applications to the Committee of the Court. A single judge may not examine applications against the state which nominated him. The three judge committee has jurisdiction to declare applications admissible and decide {{on the merits of}} the case if it was clearly well founded and based on well <b>established</b> <b>case</b> <b>law.</b> Previously the three judge committee could only declare the case inadmissible, but could not decide on the merits of the case, which could only be done by a chambers of seven judges or the Grand Chamber. Protocol 14 also provides that when a three judge committee decides on the merits of a case, the judge elected to represent that state is no longer a compulsory member of this committee. The judge can be invited by the committee, to replace one of its members, but only for specific reasons, such as when the application relates to the exhaustion of national legal remedies.|$|E
50|$|The {{accession}} of {{new states}} to the European Convention on Human Rights following {{the fall of the}} Berlin Wall in 1989 led to a sharp increase in applications filed in the Court. The efficiency of the Court was threatened seriously by the large number of pending applications, which were accumulating and increasing steadily. In 1999 8,400 applications were allocated to be heard. In 2003 27,200 cases were filed and the number of pending applications rose to approximately 65,000. In 2005, the Court opened 45,500 case files. In 2009 57,200 applications were allocated, with the number of pending applications rose to 119,300. At the time more than 90% of them were declared to be inadmissible, and the majority of cases decided, around 60% of the decisions by the Court, related to what is termed repetitive cases, where the Court has already delivered judgment finding a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights or where well <b>established</b> <b>case</b> <b>law</b> exists on a similar case. Protocol 11 was designed to deal with the backlog of pending cases by establishing the Court and its judges as a full-time institution, by simplifying the procedure and reducing the length of proceedings. However, as the workload of the Court continued to increase, the contracting states agreed that further reforms were necessary and in May 2004 the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers adopted Protocol 14 to the European Convention on Human Rights. Protocol 14 was drafted with the aim of reducing the workload of the Court and that of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, which supervises the execution of judgments, so that the Court could focus on cases that raise important human rights issues.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{influence}} of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on regional integration in Europe is a widely discussed topic in the academic literature. However, outside of Europe, the {{influence of}} court-like bodies on integration processes in other regions is much less analysed. Dispute settlement bodies in regional integration schemes outside Europe are {{not as strong as}} the ECJ, but they may nevertheless influence regional integration. When judging disputes, court-like bodies have to <b>establish</b> <b>case</b> <b>law</b> in order to be legally consistent with their decision-making – even if precedence effects are formally ruled out by the respective treaties. This <b>case</b> <b>law</b> may lead to increasing integration if the treaties are interpreted respectively. In order to explore the influence of court-like bodies on regional integration outside of Europe, this article compares NAFTA’s dispute settlement mechanisms on competition and investment with the dispute settlement mechanism of MERCOSUR. The somewhat surprising result is that although MERCOSUR’s dispute settlement mechanism is formally stronger than its counterpart in North America, the latter exercises more influence on the dynamic of regional integration.

5000|$|The Court is {{the court}} of last resort for civil and {{criminal}} matters. In certain administrative cases it has final jurisdiction as well, while in other cases this jurisdiction rests with the adjudicative division of the Council of State, the Central Appeals Tribunal (...) , the Trade and Industry Appeals Tribunal (...) as well as judicial institutions in the Caribbean part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The Court is a court of cassation, which means that it has the competence to quash or affirm rulings of lower courts, but no competence to re-examine or question the facts. It only considers whether the lower courts applied the law correctly and the rulings have sufficient reasoning. In so doing it <b>establishes</b> <b>case</b> <b>law.</b> According to Article 120 of the Constitution, courts may not rule on the constitutionality of laws passed by the States General and treaties. With the exception of constitutional Court of Sint Maarten courts (which rules on constitutionality {{with regards to the}} Sint Maarten constitution only) have thus no competence for judicial review with respect to the Constitution.|$|R

40|$|Summary: The {{issue of}} {{balancing}} free {{trade with the}} protection of values, national regulatory autonomy and sovereignty has recently been accentuated {{in the area of}} fundamental (human) rights. It is well <b>established</b> <b>case</b> <b>law</b> that fundamental rights {{are a part of the}} general principles of Community law protected by the Court, but their precise status in the EU legal order has remained unclear up to the present. Particularly questionable is the issue of the hierarchy of these rights in relation to Treaty provisions. This paper focuses on the interaction between fundamental rights and fundamental (market) freedoms, and it analyses the implications of the case law dealing, on the one hand, with their mutual enhancement and, on the other hand, with their potential confl icts. Both types of cases raise sensitive constitutional issues, because, while supporting fundamental rights protection, there is an occasional lack of concern for other interests that national regulators seek to protect...|$|E

However, s. 170 (4) of Companies Act 2006 refers to the application of common law and equitable principles to the general duties; this focuses attention on what constitutes a fiduciary duty, as it defines neither fiduciary duties nor strict duties. First, the question remains regarding to what extent a duty constitutes a fiduciary duty.
