The research included the following joints: Mortise and Tenon, double Dowel, Corner Blocks and double Gusset Plates, designed {{in the form of}} middle joints and made of beech and poplar solid wood. The test results indicated that regarding the edgewise bending force, the strongest middle joint was the double dowel joint made of beech wood (1896. 9 N), while the respective joint made of poplar marked quite a low value of bending force (937. 2 N). The strength of wooden corner blocks was proved to be quite powerful, made either of beech wood, poplar wood or the combination of the two wood species (beech: 1881. 8 N, poplar: 1237. 6 N, beech-poplar: 1783. 6 N). The <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> <b>joint</b> made of beech resulted in weaker values (1378. 2 N), compared to the dowel and corner block joints made of beech, whereas the same joint made of poplar demonstrated very satisfying values of edgewise bending force (1471. 8 N). Finally, the mortise and tenon joint appeared to have the lowest strength, both in the case of beech (1306 N) and poplar (634 N). The highest coeffi cient of elasticity (CE) derived from double <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> <b>joint,</b> made of beech. All the joints showed good elasticity, except the mortise and tenon joint made of poplar, as well as, the dowel joint made of poplar, which recorded the lowest elasticity values of all.

40|$|Failure of welded {{gusset plate}} joints in steel guyed masts due to cyclic {{stresses}} {{with a high}} mean value and amplitude {{is one of the}} major causes for their collapse when subjected to wind loading. To prevent the failure of the welded gusset joints, it is essential to assess the dynamic stress field in welded joints under wind loading. In deference to the global static buckling analysis of welded steel structures where the effects of residual stresses are very small and can be ignored, the welding residual stresses play an important role in assessing the cyclic stresses of gusset plate joints of guyed masts under wind loading. Hence, the residual stresses due to welding have to be included in the assessment. For this, the welding residual stress field in welded joints is first simulated using a numerical thermal-structural coupling analysis. The welding residual stresses are then assigned to a multi-scale finite element model as the initial stress field for the dynamic stress analysis of the welded joints, including a relaxation of the welding residual stresses. The results for the welding residual stress field and for the dynamic cyclic stress field are verified by laboratory tests. The peak value of the resulting cyclic stress is found to occur at the tip of the weld seams, and it results to high mean value and amplitude of cyclic stresses at the tips. Hence, the tips of weld seams are likely to be critical locations, where the welded <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> <b>joint</b> may fail due to cyclic stress fatigue under wind loading, and leading to the collapse of the guyed mast...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Tests to {{determine}} the structural capacity, failure modes and {{the economy of the}} eaves region of double-bay portal frames made from cold-formed lipped channels connected back to back at the eaves joint are presented. Two double-bay portal frame eaves joint configurations, namely; Eaves Connection Type 1 (ECT- 1) and Eaves Connection Type 2 (ECT- 2) are investigated. In ECT- 1, two rafters are connected to the column back-to-back with one rafter connected to the column at a lower level than the other while, in ECT- 2, two rafters are connected to the column at the same level through a hot-rolled steel <b>gusset</b> <b>plate.</b> Variables in the frames include the width of the channel flanges, strength of the channels, number of bolts, and thickness of the hot-rolled <b>gusset</b> <b>plate.</b> The <b>joints</b> are subjected to equal loads applied through pins at points of contraflexure until failure. Failure modes and experimental results are observed, recorded and analysed. A comparison between theoretical and experimental results is drawn up and analysed. In all the tested structures (ECT- 1 and ECT- 2), the cold-formed channels failed but the joints did not fail. Local buckling in the compression zone of the web and flange of the channels, bolt-bearing deformations and lateral deflection of <b>gusset</b> <b>plates</b> (in ECT- 2 only) are the three modes of failure which were observed. Local buckling in the compression zone of the web and flange of the channels was the initial and ultimate failure mode in all structures. The moment-curvature graphs show that plasticity could not be achieved in both connections (ECT- 1 and ECT- 2). The unfactored resistances of the channels are not achieved by all the joints because of local buckling and bolt-bearing deformation failure. Both theoretical and experimental results show that the two investigated joints are semi-rigid and partial-strength joints since they possess some degree of rotational stiffness and moment capacity, but are insufficiently stiff to develop full continuity and unable to achieve full moment capacity of the connected members at the eaves joint. Furthermore, the investigation shows that ECT- 1 is the most economic joint from a structural and material cost point of view, compared to ECT- 2 joints. However, ECT- 2 joints are [...] . M. Phil.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 <b>Gusset</b> <b>plate</b> {{connections}} {{are commonly used}} to join members in steel truss bridges. Most <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> connections were designed to provide sufficient thickness to resist tensile and shear forces as well as compression buckling based on simple approximations. The 2007 collapse of the I- 35 W Bridge in Minnesota necessitated the safety assessment of <b>gusset</b> <b>plates</b> and prompted several studies of <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> behavior. The complex geometry and various loading profiles {{make it difficult to}} analyze and estimate maximum stress in <b>gusset</b> <b>plates</b> and its capacity. This research focuses on numerical simulation of steel truss bridge <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> connections. A simple but accurate finite element modeling methodology was developed to efficiently simulate <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> connection subassemblages. A rapid procedure for assessing <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> safety, namely Triage Evaluation Procedure (TEP), was developed to predict the onset of <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> yielding. This procedure considers the worst-case scenario for the interaction of stresses generated by connected truss members and conservatively identifies at risk <b>gusset</b> <b>plates.</b> A Refined Evaluation Procedure (REP) was then developed to predict stress distributions at critical sections using simple and idealized approximate stress distribution models. By using these stress distribution models at the critical sections, the location and magnitude of the maximum stress in the <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> connections can be estimated. The TEP and REP are two-step evaluation procedures to provide fast and accurate estimate for <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> yield capacity. In addition to the <b>gusset</b> <b>plates,</b> rivet shear resistance needs to be considered to evaluate the overall safety of <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> connections. Rivet shear strength, rivet ductility, connected member yielding, and the effect of connection length were identified as factors which affect joint strength.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 The {{collapse}} of the I- 35 W Bridge in Minneapolis, MN in 2007 prompted {{an investigation into the}} design and inspection of the steel truss bridges. Further investigation into the collapse revealed that a <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> experienced sway buckling, causing the bridge failure. This bridge failure motivated research into the analysis and design of <b>gusset</b> <b>plates.</b> Another major motivation for the current research is the effect of the connecting member's stiffness on the capacity of the <b>gusset</b> <b>plate,</b> which is not considered in the current design methods. The research presented in this thesis discusses a nonlinear finite-element analysis approach using OpenSees for load rating <b>gusset</b> <b>plates</b> in steel structures. Using OpenSees to analyze and design <b>gusset</b> <b>plates</b> is a new approach and therefore validation of the model was required. Simple tension, bending, shear, h-refinement, element type, patch, and elastic range tests were conducted to validate the model. The major parameters studied in this research include: element size, material properties, connecting member stiffness, plate geometry, out-of-plane shape, and magnitude of out-of-plane imperfection at the loaded members in the <b>gusset</b> <b>plate.</b> The displacement at the centroid of the loaded members was monitored as well as out-of-plane displacement and stress contours in the <b>gusset</b> <b>plate.</b> The results showed a strong correlation to other finite-element analysis program predictions and experimental results from sway buckling experiments.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 The {{collapse}} of the I- 35 W Bridge in Minneapolis, MN on August 1, 2007 brought into question the design and inspection of <b>gusset</b> <b>plates</b> in steel truss bridges. The experimental tests performed in this research study the sway-buckling strength and behavior of large-scale steel <b>gusset</b> <b>plates</b> in an isolated truss connection. Parameters studied include plate thickness,combination member loading, initial out-of-plane imperfection, diagonal compression member out-of-plane flexural stiffness, corrosion, and alternative retrofits to increase lateral stiffness. The flexural stiffness of the diagonal compression member and retrofit designs were unique to the testing program. The variables monitored during testing include <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> surface stresses and strains, member axial strains, out-of-plane displacement of the <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> free edge, and buckling capacity. The results were compared with previously established design models for predicting buckling capacity of <b>gusset</b> <b>plates</b> which include the Whitmore effective width, the Modified-Thornton method, and the FHWA Load Rating Guidelines. A parametric finite element model was developed to determine the lateral stiffness of the <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> connection and the additional stiffness provided by the alternative retrofit options. The results showed interaction between the diagonal compression member and <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> occurs, which affects sway-buckling capacity. Combination of member loads showed evidence of detrimental effects on sway-buckling capacity. Corrosion of the <b>gusset</b> <b>plates</b> along {{the top edge of}} the bottom chord did not lead to significant reduction in sway-buckling capacity.

The <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> was modeled after a connection in a steel truss bridge located on an interstate highway in Oregon. A series of 10 images were used to demonstrate methodology and to compare resulting measurements of <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> geometry from the orthophotos. Overall, images taken with greater skew angles had larger errors than those which were more orthogonal to the mock <b>gusset</b> <b>plate.</b> The largest percentage errors were found using Camera 3 due to more radial distortion inherent in the built-in camera lens. When the <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> filled {{a larger proportion of}} the overall image, the camera had higher resolution, and a sharp well focused image was taken, and results were improved. Typical absolute measurement errors were 0. 27 in...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Gusset</b> <b>plates</b> are {{thick sheets}} of steel {{that are used}} to connect beams and girders to columns or to connect truss members. A <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> can be {{fastened}} to a permanent member either by bolts, rivets or welding or a combination of the three. <b>Gusset</b> <b>plates</b> not only serve as a method of joining steel members together but they also strengthen the joint. [...] They are used in bridges and buildings as well as other structures.|$|R
40|$|A {{parametric}} {{study of}} the inelastic compressive behaviour and strength of <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> connections is presented in this paper. The study is performed by the commercial finite element program ABAQUS. Based on the parametric study, general design guidelines are proposed. To increase the buckling strength of <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> connections efficiently and improve the energy absorption behaviour of the connections under cyclic loading, adding the centerline stiffener along the splice member {{as close to the}} beam and column boundaries as possible and/or adding free edge stiffeners are recommended. In addition, welded connection between the splice member and the <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> is recommended. The splice member with higher bending rigidity such as tee-sections and channel sections should always be used. Shaping the <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> according to 30 ° load dispersion angle may be recommended {{to reduce the size of}} the connection between the <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> and the beam and column boundaries provided that the splice member is sufficiently extended beyond the bending line. Finally, a design method accompanied by some design charts for rectangular type <b>gusset</b> <b>plates</b> subject to compression is proposed based on an inelastic plate buckling equation.

40|$|The I- 35 W Bridge {{over the}} Mississippi River in Minneapolis, MN had a catastrophic {{failure in the}} main span of the deck truss in 2007. This {{collapse}} has brought significant attention on the <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> connections in steel truss bridges throughout the U. S. Steel truss bridge <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> design has not received much focus in the past 40 years, {{and there is a}} lack of consensus within the design profession on the procedures to evaluate, design, and rate these critical elements. In the short term, based on the best available information on the <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> design, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has issued preliminary guidance. Although some experimental research has been conducted on the ultimate strength of <b>gusset</b> <b>plates,</b> much of this work has been directed toward the performance of tension members and their connections. There has been limited experimental work on the compression capacity and stability of <b>gusset</b> <b>plates,</b> but most of this work is relevant primarily to bracing connections common in building structures. This research focuses on comprehensive experimental and analytical studies on steel truss bridge <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> behavior. The studies include comparisons of advanced analytical models with the responses from large-scale experimental tests using discrete and innovative full-field measurements. The calibrated finite element analysis models are then utilized to study a variety of <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> configurations. Improved mechanistic idealizations that better capture the observed behavior in the experiments and analytical studies are proposed as the result of this work. The design checks recommended in this thesis present a comprehensive methodology for determining the ultimate <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> resistance. This research provides a large database of original results that will be useful for future similar studies. In addition, this research provides modeling procedures that permit the study of steel truss bridge connections and their adjacent framing members using truss bridge sub-assemblies. Based on the comprehensive analytical studies, simple and accurate design calculation procedures to assess the nominal ultimate strength of steel truss <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> connections are recommended for steel truss bridge <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> connections.

50|$|<b>Gusset</b> <b>plates</b> {{are used}} for various structures. <b>Gusset</b> <b>plates</b> are used to connect beams and columns {{together}} or to connect truss members. They can be either {{the only way of}} connecting the beam and columns or they can be used with bolts and welds.|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} {{thirteen}} full-scale {{tests were conducted}} to investigate the compressive behavior and strength of <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> connections. The test parameters included <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> thickness, size, and brace angle. In addition, the effects of frame action on the compressive behavior of <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> connections were also investigated. In general, the <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> specimens were failed by sway buckling of the connection since no out-of-plane restraint was provided from the bracing member. The test results indicated that, in general, significant yielding of the <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> specimens occurred prior to reaching the ultimate load. However, only limited yielding was observed for the thin specimens with a plate thickness of 6. 5 mm. The ultimate load of the specimens increased almost linearly proportional to the <b>gusset</b> <b>plate</b> thickness and decreased with increasing plate size. A slight decrease in the ultimate load of the specimens was observed when a 30 ° brace angle was used instead of a 45 ° one. The beam and column moment had only negligible effects on the ultimate load of the specimens; however, yielding of the specimens was detected at a load level significantly lower than that had no framing moment. The numerical simulation provided good agreement with the test results. Department of Building and Real Estat...|$|R

50|$|The {{bridge was}} widened and the {{substructure}} was strengthened between 1992 and 1993 to accommodate hard shoulders. The Blatnik Bridge {{was reduced to}} two lanes temporarily in 2008, after it was discovered in a bridge inspection that the 1990s upgrades to the Blatnik Bridge had added weight beyond the load limit for <b>gusset</b> <b>plates</b> in eight different locations. This {{was similar to the}} <b>gusset</b> <b>plates</b> that caused the I-35W Bridge in Minneapolis to collapse on August 1, 2007. The Blatnik Bridge was reduced to two lanes temporarily until the <b>gusset</b> <b>plates</b> could be strengthened.|$|R
