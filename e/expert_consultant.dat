2500|$|A December 2006 New York Times article {{based on}} leaked company {{documents}} {{concluded that the}} company had engaged in a deliberate effort to downplay olanzapine's side effects.

[...] In 2007 Lilly filed a protection order to stop the dissemination of some of the documents, which Judge Jack B. Weinstein of the Brooklyn Federal District Court granted, and criticized the New York Times reporter, Gottstein, and Egilman in the ruling.

2500|$|Wine {{making and}} vine growing {{go back to}} colonial times in New Zealand. British Resident and keen oenologist James Busby was, as early as 1836, {{attempting}} to produce wine at his land in Waitangi. In 1851 New Zealand's oldest existing vineyard was established by French Roman Catholic missionaries at Mission Estate in Hawke's Bay. [...] In 1883 William Henry Beetham was recognised as being the first pioneer to plant Pinot Noir and Hermitage (Syrah) grapes in New Zealand at his Lansdowne vineyard in Masterton. In 1895 the <b>expert</b> <b>consultant</b> viticulturist and oenologist Romeo Bragato was invited by the NZ government's Department of Agriculture to investigate winemaking possibilities and after tasting Beetham's Hermitage he concluded that the Wairarapa and New Zealand was [...] "pre-eminently suited to viticulture". Beetham was supported in his endeavours by his French wife Marie Zelie Hermance Frere Beetham. Their partnership and innovation to pursue winemaking helped {{form the basis of}} modern New Zealand's viticulture practices. Due to economic (the importance of animal agriculture and the protein export industry), legislative (prohibition and the temperance) and cultural factors (the overwhelming predominance of beer and spirit drinking British immigrants), wine was for many years a marginal activity in terms of economic importance. Dalmatian immigrants arriving in New Zealand {{at the end of the}} nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century brought with them viticultural knowledge and planted vineyards in West and North Auckland. Typically, their vineyards produced sherry and port for the palates of New Zealanders of the time, and table wine for their own community.|$|E
