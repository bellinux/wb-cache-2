40|$|In {{the case}} of a large scale {{radiation}} accident high throughput methods of biological dosimetry for population triage are needed to identify individuals requiring clinical treatment. The dicentric assay performed in web-based scoring mode may be a very suitable technique. Within the MULTIBIODOSE EU FP 7 project a network is being established of 8 laboratories with expertise in dose estimations based on the dicentric assay. Here, the manual dicentric assay was tested in a web-based scoring mode. More than 23, 000 high resolution images of metaphase spreads (only first mitosis) were captured by four laboratories and established as image galleries on the internet (cloud). The galleries included images of a complete <b>dose</b> <b>effect</b> <b>curve</b> (0 - 5. 0 Gy) and three types of irradiation scenarios simulating acute whole body, partial body and protracted exposure. The blood samples had been irradiated in vitro with gamma rays at the University of Ghent, Belgium. Two laboratories provided image galleries from Fluorescence plus Giemsa stained slides (3 h colcemid) and the image galleries from the other two laboratories contained images from Giemsa stained preparations (24 h colcemid). Each of the 8 participating laboratories analysed 3 dose points of the <b>dose</b> <b>effect</b> <b>curve</b> (scoring 100 cells for each point) and 3 unknown dose points (50 cells) for each of the 3 simulated irradiation scenarios. At first all analyses were performed in a QuickScan Mode without scoring individual chromosomes, followed by conventional scoring (only complete cells, 46 centromeres). The calibration curves obtained using these two scoring methods were very similar, with {{no significant difference in the}} linear-quadratic curve coefficients. Analysis of variance showed a significant effect of dose on the yield of dicentrics, but no significant effect of the laboratories, different methods of slide preparation or different incubation times used for colcemid. The results obtained to date within the MULTIBIODOSE project by a network of 8 collaborating laboratories throughout Europe are very promising.

In {{case of an}} {{accidental}} overexposure to ionizing radiation where the dose received by the victim is over 5 Gy, the conventional biological indicator of dose, the dicentric assay, does not provide an accurate enough dose measurement. A more appropriate technique is to measure ring chromosomes in stimulated lymphocytes.

The dicentric assay is the gold standard technique for the performance of biological dosimetry, but it is very time consuming and needs well trained scorers. To increase the throughput of blood samples, semi-automation of dicentric scoring was investigated in the framework of the MULTIBIODOSE EU FP 7 project, and <b>dose</b> <b>effect</b> <b>curves</b> were established in six biodosimetry laboratories. To validate these <b>dose</b> <b>effect</b> <b>curves,</b> blood samples from 33 healthy donors (> 10 donors/scenario) were irradiated in vitro with Co- 60 gamma rays simulating three different exposure scenarios: acute whole body, partial body, and protracted exposure, with three different doses for each scenario. All the blood samples were irradiated at Ghent University, Belgium, and then shipped blind coded to the participating laboratories. The blood samples were set up by each lab using their own standard protocols, and metaphase slides were prepared to validate the calibration curves established by semi-automatic dicentric scoring. In order to achieve this, 300 metaphases per sample were captured, and the doses were estimated using the newly formed <b>dose</b> <b>effect</b> <b>curves.</b> After acute uniform exposure, all laboratories were able to distinguish between 0 Gy, 0. 5 Gy, 2. 0, and 4. 0 Gy (p < 0. 001), and, in most cases, the dose estimates were within a range of +/- 0. 5 Gy of the given dose. After protracted exposure, all laboratories were able to distinguish between 1. 0 Gy, 2. 0 Gy, and 4. 0 Gy (p < 0. 001), and here also a large number of the dose estimates were within +/- 0. 5 Gy of the irradiation dose. After simulated partial body exposure, all laboratories were able to distinguish between 2. 0 Gy, 4. 0 Gy, and 6. 0 Gy (p < 0. 001). Overdispersion of the dicentric distribution enabled the detection of the partial body samples; however, this result was clearly dose-dependent. For partial body exposures, only a few dose estimates were in the range of +/- 0. 5 Gy of the given dose, but an improvement could be achieved with higher cell numbers. The new method of semi-automation of the dicentric assay was introduced successfully in a network of six laboratories. It is therefore concluded that this method {{can be used as a}} high-throughput screening tool in a large-scale radiation accident...|$|R

The present study used the drug discrimination paradigm to measure the subjective effects of the atypical antipsychotic amisulpride and to examine the underlying neuropharmacological mechanisms responsible for the discriminative stimulus property of the drug. Male C 57 BL/ 6 mice were trained to discriminate 10 mg/kg (-) S amisulpride from vehicle in a two-lever drug discrimination task. A <b>dose</b> <b>effect</b> <b>curve</b> for (-) S amisulpride yielded an ED 50 = 1. 77 mg/kg 95 % CI [1. 28, 2. 45 mg/kg].

There was partial substitution for (+) R amisulpride, and full substitution for (±) SR amisulpride with a significant rightward shift in the dose effect curves.

40|$|Monoamine releasers {{constitute}} {{one class}} of drugs currently under investigation as potential agonist medications {{for the treatment}} of cocaine dependence. The efficacy and safety of monoamine releasers as candidate medications may be influenced in part by their relative potency to release dopamine and serotonin, and we reported previously that releasers with approximately 30 -fold selectivity for dopamine versus serotonin release may be especially promising. The present study examined the effects of the releasers benzylpiperazine, (+) phenmetrazine, and 4 -benzylpiperidine, which have 20 - to 48 -fold selectivity in vitro for releasing dopamine versus serotonin. In an assay of cocaine discrimination, rhesus monkeys were trained to discriminate 0. 4 mg/kg i. m. cocaine from saline in a two-key, food-reinforced procedure. Each of the releasers produced a dose- and time-dependent substitution for cocaine. 4 -Benzylpiperidine had the most rapid onset and shortest duration of action. Phenmetrazine and benzylpiperazine had slower onsets and longer durations of action. In an assay of cocaine self-administration, rhesus monkeys were trained to respond for cocaine injections and food pellets under a second order schedule. Treatment for 7 days with each of the releasers produced a dose-dependent and selective reduction in self-administration of cocaine (0. 01 mg/kg/injection). The most selective effects were produced by phenmetrazine. Phenmetrazine also produced a downward shift in the cocaine self-administration <b>dose</b> <b>effect</b> <b>curve,</b> virtually eliminating responding maintained by a 30 -fold range of cocaine doses (0. 0032 – 0. 1 mg/kg/injection) while having only small and transient effects on food-maintained responding.

40|$|AbstractIn a {{previous}} study the simple, naturally derived coumarin scopoletin (SCT) was identified as an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), using a pharmacophore-based virtual screening approach. In this study the potential of SCT as procholinergic and cognition-enhancing therapeutic was investigated in a more detailed way, using different experimental approaches like measuring newly synthesized acetylcholine (ACh) in synaptosomes, long-term potentiation (LTP) experiments in hippocampal slices, and behavior studies. SCT enhanced the K+-stimulated release of ACh from rat frontal cortex synaptosomes, showing a bell-shaped <b>dose</b> <b>effect</b> <b>curve</b> (Emax: 4 μM). This effect was blocked by the nicotinic ACh receptor (nAChR) antagonists mecamylamine (MEC) and dihydro-β-erythroidine (DHE). The nAChR agonist (and AChE inhibitor) galantamine induced a similar increase in ACh release (Emax: 1 μM). SCT potentiated LTP in hippocampal slices of rat brain. The high-frequency stimulation (HFS) -induced, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor dependent LTP of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials at CA 3 -CA 1 synapses was greatly enhanced by pre-HFS application of SCT (4 μM for 4 min). This effect was mimicked by nicotine (2 μM) and abolished by MEC, suggesting an effect on nAChRs. SCT did not restore the total inhibition of LTP by NMDA receptor antagonist d, l- 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonopentanoic acid (AP- 5). SCT (2 μg, i. c. v.) increased T-maze alternation and ameliorated novel object recognition of mice with scopolamine-induced cholinergic deficit. It also reduced age-associated deficits in object memory of 15 – 18 -month-old mice (2 mg/kg sc).

30|$|Pharmacodynamics {{relates the}} drug {{concentrations}} to its specific effect. For fluids, the Frank–Starling relationship between cardiac output and cardiac preload {{is the equivalent}} of the <b>dose</b> <b>effect</b> <b>curve</b> for standard medications. Because of the shape of the Frank–Starling relationship, the response of cardiac output to the fluid-induced increase in cardiac preload is not constant [44]. The effective dose 50 (ED 50), in pharmacology, is the dose or amount of drug that produces a therapeutic response or desired effect in 50 % of the subjects receiving it, whereas lethal dose 50 (LD 50) will result in death of 50 % of recipients. Translated to IV fluids, this would be the dose of fluid that induces, respectively, a therapeutic response or death in 50 % of the patients. The problem is that the therapeutic response varies from one patient to another. Fluid administration can be toxic (or even lethal) at a high enough dose, as demonstrated in 2007 when a California woman died of water intoxication (and hyponatremia) in a contest organized by a radio station ([URL] The difference between toxicity and efficacy is dependent upon the particular patient and the specific condition of that patient, although the amount of fluids administered by a physician should fall into the predetermined therapeutic window. Unanswered questions remain: what is an effective dose of IV fluids? What is the exact desired therapeutic effect? What is the therapeutic window? In some patients, volume expansion increases the mean systemic filling pressure (the backward pressure of venous return), but it increases the right atrial pressure (the forward pressure of venous return) to the same extent, such that venous return and, hence, cardiac output do not increase [45]. Hence, venous congestion and backward failure may even play a more important and currently underestimated role [46]. The probability of the heart to “respond” to fluid by a significant increase in cardiac preload varies along the shock time course, and thus, pharmacodynamics of fluids must be regularly evaluated. At the very early phase, fluid responsiveness is constant. After the very initial fluid administration, only one half of patients with circulatory failure respond to an increase in cardiac output [47].|$|E
40|$|Rationale: +/- 3, 4 -Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; Ecstasy) {{consumption}} {{has increased}} globally {{over the past}} two decades. Human studies have demonstrated that in a small proportion of users MDMA consumption may become problematic. Limited preclinical studies have evaluated the abuse potential of MDMA. Objectives: The present study sought to determine if MDMA selfadministration has similar addictive properties as other abused substances. Initial experiments sought to determine if MDMA could function as a reinforcer. Subsequent experiments assessed whether dopamine played a role in MDMA self-administration, whether MDMA self-administration was maintained by the presentation of a conditioned stimulus, and if extinguished MDMA self-administration could be reinstated. Methods: Animals were surgically implanted with indwelling intravenous catheters that allowed delivery of MDMA solution upon depression of an active lever. MDMA self-administration was examined in drug naïve and cocaine-trained animals. Further assessment of the reliability of self-administration was assessed using a yoked procedure, dose effect curves were obtained, vehicle substitution occurred, and progressive ratio procedures were used. The underlying role of dopamine in mediating MDMA self-administration was determined using the D 1 - like antagonist, SCH 23390, and D 2 -like antagonist, eticlopride. Manipulation of the light and/or drug stimulus was used to provide initial assessment of the conditioning properties of MDMA. The ability of 10 mg/kg MDMA to reinstate responding previously maintained by MDMA was also determined. Results: MDMA was reliably self-administered in drug naïve and cocaine trained animals. Responding was selective to contingent MDMA administration, reduced with vehicle substitution, sensitive to dose manipulation, and increasing demand. A rightward shift in the <b>dose</b> <b>effect</b> <b>curve</b> was demonstrated after administration of SCH 23390. Removal of both the light and drug stimuli produced a rapid reduction in responding. Removal of either the light or drug stimulus produced a gradual reduction over 15 days. Administration of MDMA reinstated responding previously maintained by MDMA. Conclusion: The demonstration of reliable MDMA self-administration provided a baseline for assessing MDMA abuse potential. MDMA selfadministration was mediated by dopaminergic mechanisms which may be similar to those demonstrated for other abused substances. MDMA selfadministration also produced conditioning - a feature of compulsive drug use. Responding previously maintained by MDMA was later reinstated by MDMA, demonstrating that MDMA use may result in relapse. MDMA has similar behavioural properties as other commonly abused substances...|$|E
40|$|Rationale +/- 3, 4 -Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) {{produces}} {{effects on}} a number of neurochemical systems. Many studies have shown that repeated MDMA administration produces deficits in central serotonergic neurotransmission, which have been suggested to underlie some of the behavioural changes associated with use. Objectives The present studies sought to evaluate the functional statuses of the serotonin transporter (SERT) and the serotonin 2 c (5 -HT 2 c) and serotonin 2 a (5 -HT 2 a) receptors following treatment with MDMA to determine whether behavioural deficits could be attributed to alterations in these proteins. Methods Rats received a pretreatment regimen of MDMA (4 x 10 mg/kg MDMA injections administered at 2 h intervals) or the saline vehicle and, 2 weeks later, [3 H] paroxetine binding was undertaken to assess densities of SERT. In other groups, dose-effect curves for MDMA-produced hyperactivity were determined. Additional groups were tested following a 12 -week withdrawal period from MDMA in order to assess whether there was recovery of function. The functional status of the SERT was further examined by determining the effect of MDMA pretreatment on the reduction in MDMA-produced hyperactivity (0. 0 - 10. 0 mg/kg) produced by the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, clomipramine (0. 0 - 5. 0 mg/kg). The ability for the 5 -HT 2 c receptor agonist, m-CPP (0. 0 - 2. 5 mg/kg) to produce hypolocomotion or increased emergence latency or for the 5 -HT 2 a receptor agonist, DOI (0. 0 - 2. 0 mg/kg) to produce wetdog shakes (WDS) were examined in MDMA pretreated rats. The ability for the 5 -HT 2 c receptors to modulate MDMA-produced hyperactivity was assessed by examining the effect of MDMA pretreatment on the potentiation of MDMA-produced hyperactivity produced by the selective antagonist, RS 102221 (0. 0 - 1. 0 mg/kg). Conversely, the modulatory abilities of the 5 -HT 2 a receptors were assessed by examining the effect of MDMA pretreatment on the attenuation of MDMA-produced hyperactivity produced by the antagonist, ritanserin (0. 0 - 10. 0 mg/kg). Results MDMA pretreatment produced widespread reductions in SERT binding densities 2 weeks following administration. Prior exposure to MDMA rendered rats tolerant to MDMA-produced hyperactivity when tested 2, but not 12, weeks following MDMA administration. Two weeks following MDMA pretreatment rats were also less responsive to the clomipramine-produced attenuation of MDMA-produced hyperactivity. MDMA pretreatment failed to alter M-CPP -produced hypolocomotion or increased emergence latency, but decreased the ability for DOI to induce WDS. Further, MDMA pretreated rats exhibited tolerance to RS 102221 as shown by a rightward shift in the <b>dose</b> <b>effect</b> <b>curve</b> and complete tolerance to ritanserin. Conclusions Following MDMA pretreatment, the decreased SERT binding densities and inability of clomipramine to attenuate MDMA-produced effects might explain tolerance to the locomotor activating effects produced by MDMA. Functional recovery also occurred with extended abstinence from the drug, suggesting that MDMA produced transient serotonergic alterations. The results support the idea that the 5 -HT 2 a and 5 -HT 2 c receptors that modulate MDMA-produced hyperactivity are functionally distinct from the receptors that mediate m-CPP- and DOI-induced behavioural responses, as m-CPP-produced behaviours were resilient, yet RS 102221 -induced effects were reduced, by MDMA pretreatment. RS 102221 is highly selective in comparison to ritanserin, yet there was only one dose that produced significant potentiation of MDMA-produced hyperactivity, whereas there were several effective ritanserin doses. This suggests that the 5 -HT 2 a receptors had a greater role in modulating MDMA-produced hyperactivity. Additionally, 5 -HT 2 a receptors might be more susceptible to MDMA-induced desensitisation than 5 -HT 2 c receptors, as MDMA pretreated rats exhibited some tolerance to the potentiating effects of RS 102221 but were unresponsive to any ritanserin dose. In conclusion, MDMA-induced locomotor tolerance was attributable to decreased SERT densities and function as well as desensitisation of 5 -HT 2 a receptors that facilitate hyperactivity...|$|E

Independent groups of rats with intravenous catheters were given the possibility to self-administer different doses of ketamine (125, 250, and 500 mu g/kg per infusion) under two environmental conditions.

Strategies to prevent the development of LID aim at providing more stable dopaminergic stimulation. We have previously shown that deuterium substitutions in the L-DOPA molecule (D 3 -L-DOPA) yield dopamine that appears more resistant to enzymatic breakdown. We here investigated the effects of D 3 -L-DOPA on motor performance and development of dyskinesias in a rodent model of Parkinson's disease. Through acute experiments, monitoring rotational behavior, <b>dose</b> <b>effect</b> <b>curves</b> were established for D 3 -L-DOPA and L-DOPA. The equipotent dose of D 3 -L-DOPA was estimated to be 60 % of L-DOPA. Subsequently, animals were treated with either the equipotent dose of D 3 -L-DOPA (5 mg/kg), the equivalent dose of D 3 -L-DOPA (8 mg/kg), L-DOPA (8 mg/kg) or vehicle. The equivalent dose of D 3 -L-DOPA produced superior anti-akinetic effects compared to L-DOPA in the cylinder test (p< 0. 05), whereas the equipotent dose of D 3 -L-DOPA produced an anti-akinetic effect similar to L-DOPA. Dyskinesias developed to the same degree in the groups treated with equivalent doses of D 3 -L-DOPA and L-DOPA. The equipotent dose of D 3 -L-DOPA induced fewer dyskinesias than L-DOPA (p< 0. 05). In conclusion, our study provides evidence for improved potency and reduced side-effects of L-DOPA by deuterium substitutions in the molecule. These results are of clinical interest since the occurrence of LID is related to the total L-DOPA dose administered. D 3 -L-DOPA may thus represent a novel strategy to reduce the total dose requirement and yet achieve an effective control of parkinsonian symptoms. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{radiation}} effects induced by Co 60 {{serve as a}} reference system for the consideration of LET and RBE in normal and tumor tissue dose-effect relations are usually handled by the linear-quadratic model (LQ). This approximation excellently works up to the shoulder domain. In particle therapy we have strictly differ between RBE in the initial plateau and environment of the Bragg peak. Thus for protons LET and RBE of the initial plateau agree with Co 60, whereas in the Bragg peak domain both properties are increased,, but RBE of SOBP only varies between 1. 1 and 1. 17. The RBE of carbon ions is increased once again Their dose-effect curves are much steeper with a rather small shoulder domain due to dense ionizing radiation effect. Thus protons are also dense ionizing in the Bragg peak region, but with rather smaller magnitude compared to carbon ions. A generalization of the LQ-model based on the nonlinear reaction-diffusion model is proposed to describe LET and RBE of dense ionizing particles, which accounts for properties of micro- and nano-dosimetry. A linear term of a reaction diffusion formula describes the destroy of cells, the nonlinear term is related to repair and the diffusion term accounts for {{the density of the}} radiation damages.

Application and consolidation of the method of premature chromosome condensation (PCC) where no stimulation at lymphocytes is needed IV. 	Development of a fast, sensitive and reliable methodology, absolutely original in the field of biological dosimetry for dose evaluation combining the PCC method with the FISH using PNA probes for centromers and telomers V. 	Construction for all the above methodologies, using in vitro experiments, of calibration curves dose-effect where unstable chromosomal aberrations where plotted against gamma dose given. The dose interval investigated was between 0. 3 Gy and 8 Gy; more than 12. 500 slides with metaphases and interphases were scored using Microscopic analysis of chromosome aberrations. <b>Dose</b> <b>effect</b> <b>curves</b> are linear quadratic and for their construction a minimum of 500 cells or 100 dicentrics per dose were analysed. The Poisson distribution of the chromosomal aberrations was tested for every dose and the coefficients alpha and beta of the linear quadratic equation, their errors and p value were calculated. Finally, all calibration curves obtained with the different methodologies were compared and the advantages of each methodology reported. ...|$|R

For quantal data {{such as cancer}} incidence rates, much larger numbers of animals are required than for continuous data such as biomarker measurements. For example, 155 animals per dose group are required {{to have at least}} an 80 % chance of detecting a decrease from a 20 % incidence in controls to an incidence of 10 % at a low dose. For a continuous measurement, only 14 animals per group are required to have at least an 80 % chance of detecting a change of the mean by one standard deviation of the control group. Experimental designs based on three dose groups plus controls are discussed to detect non-monotonicity or to estimate the zero equivalent dose (ZED), i. e., the dose that produces a response equal to the average response in the controls.

40|$|Rationale: Following {{repeated}} +/- 3, 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) administration {{there is}} tolerance to many behavioural effects and deficits in serotonergic neurotransmission. Objectives: The present studies had three main objectives. 1. To develop a behavioural assay {{to examine the}} effects of acute and repeated MDMA exposure. 2. To use this behavioural assay to determine whether functional changes in serotonin (5 -HT) 2 a or 5 -HT 2 c receptors accompany tolerance to the effects of MDMA. 3. To attempt to reverse behavioural tolerance and 5 -HT deficits by administering a treatment that has been shown to desensitise the 5 -HT 1 a autoreceptor. Methods: In separate groups of rats the <b>dose</b> <b>effect</b> <b>curves</b> for MDMAproduced hyperactivity were determined (0. 0, 1. 0, 3. 3, 10. 0 mg/kg). In additional groups the effect of MDMA pretreatment (4 X 10 mg/kg MDMA injections at 2 hour intervals) or saline vehicle on MDMA-produced hyperactivity was assessed. To determine the experimental parameters for MDMA effects in the Emergence Test (ET) separate groups of rats received MDMA (0. 0, 3. 3 mg/kg) and were either habituated to a hide box for various periods (15, 30, 45 mins) or exposed to the test arena 3 times over a period of days (day 1, 5, 9) or injected daily in the home cage with MDMA (0. 0, 3. 3 mg/kg) for 3 days. Emergence latency following injections of MDMA (0. 0, 3. 3 mg/kg), the 5 -HT 2 a /c agonistm-CPP (0. 0, 0. 3, 0. 6 or 1. 25 m/kg), the 5 -HT releasing stimulant, fenfluramine (0. 0, 1. 0, 2. 0 mg/kg), and the 5 -HT 2 a agonist DOI (0. 0, 1. 0, 2. 0 mg/kg) was measured. The role of 5 -HT 2 c receptors was assessed by determining the effect of the 5 -HT 2 c antagonist, RS 102221 (0. 0, 0. 25, 0. 5, 1. 0 mg/kg). The effect of MDMA pretreatment on MDMA (0. 0, 3. 3 mg/kg), m-CPP (1. 25 mg/kg), or fenfluramine (2. 0 mg/kg) induced increases in emergence latency was also assessed. The functional status of the 5 -HT 1 a autoreceptor following MDMA pretreatment was determined by measuring the effect of the 5 -HT 1 a agonist, 8 - OHDPAT (0. 0, 0. 315, 0. 0625, 0. 125, 0. 25, 0. 5 mg/kg, SC), on body temperature. The ability of the 5 -HT 1 a antagonist, WAY 100635 (0. 0, 0. 01, 0. 1, 1. 0 mg/kg, SC, 1 X daily for 7 days or by local injection of 0. 0 or 500 ng into the dorsal raphe) to reverse the attenuation of MDMA-induced hyperactivity following MDMA pretreatment was examined. Effects of various treatments on tissue levels of 5 -HT and 5 -HIAA were also measured using HPLC with EC. Results: MDMA produced dose-dependent hyperactivity and tolerance was produced by MDMA pretreatment. MDMA (3. 3 mg/kg) increased emergence latency following a 30 minute habituation period and this effect was reduced in MDMA-pretreated rats. Fenfluramine and m-CPP but not DOI also increased emergence latency in a dose-dependent manner. RS 102221 dose dependently blocked the acute effects of MDMA and m-CPP. Two weeks following MDMA pretreatment rats were tolerant to the effects of MDMA and fenfluramine, but not m-CPP. MDMA pretreatment also produced significant reductions in tissue levels of 5 -HT and 5 -HIAA. Subcutaneous WAY 100635 administration failed to reverse the behavioural and neurochemical deficits produced by MDMA pretreatment but local administration increased MDMA-produced hyperactivity in saline and MDMA pretreated rats and reversed MDMA-produced 5 -HT tissue depletions. Conclusion: The Emergence Test is a behavioural assay sensitive to the effects of acute and repeated MDMA exposure. Following MDMA pretreatment behavioural tolerance as measured by the ET is likely to be due to impaired 5 -HT release rather than changes in 5 -HT 2 a or 5 -HT 2 c receptor responses. Because partial reversal of tolerance and 5 -HT deficits following repeated MDMA administration was achieved through local DRN 5 -HT 1 a antagonist administration the 5 -HT 1 a autoreceptor may prove to be a clinical target for the reversal of MDMA produced deficits...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The true <b>dose</b> <b>effect</b> in flexible-dose {{clinical}} trials may be obscured and even reversed because dose and outcome are related. Methods To evaluate <b>dose</b> <b>effect</b> in response on primary efficacy scales from 2 randomized, double-blind, flexible-dose trials {{of patients with}} bipolar mania who received olanzapine (N = 234, 5 – 20 mg/day), or patients with schizophrenia who received olanzapine (N = 172, 10 – 20 mg/day), we used marginal structural models, inverse probability of treatment weighting (MSM, IPTW) methodology. Dose profiles for mean changes from baseline were evaluated using weighted MSM with a repeated measures model. To adjust for selection bias due to non-random dose assignment and dropouts, patient-specific time-dependent weights were determined as products of (i) stable weights based on inverse probability of receiving the sequence of dose assignments that was actually received by a patient up to given time multiplied by (ii) stable weights based on inverse probability of patient remaining on treatment by that time. Results were compared with those by unweighted analyses. Results While the observed difference in efficacy scores for dose groups for the unweighted analysis strongly favored lower doses, the weighted analyses showed no strong <b>dose</b> <b>effects</b> and, in some cases, reversed the apparent "negative <b>dose</b> <b>effect.</b> " Conclusion While naïve comparison of groups by last or modal dose in a flexible-dose trial may result in severely biased efficacy analyses, the MSM with IPTW estimators approach may be a valuable method of removing these biases and evaluating potential <b>dose</b> <b>effect,</b> which may prove useful for planning confirmatory trials. </p...|$|R

40|$|This dissertation, {{composed}} of three papers to be submitted {{for publication in}} scholarly journals, focuses on Bayesian methods in function estimation. Chapter 2 specifically discusses spectral density estimation. The semiparametric estimator derived in this chapter combines a smoothed version of the periodogram with a parametric estimator of the spectral density. This semiparametric estimator, which shrinks towards the parametric form provided it is correct, is derived from a hierarchical model. This estimator is consistent, it is competitive with other estimators (as seen through simulation studies), and ultimately {{does not require the}} specification of a parametric form.;The third and fourth chapters begin by modeling longitudinal data with linear mixed regression splines. The knots associated with the fixed and random <b>effect</b> <b>curves</b> (in the mixed model) are identified using Bayesian methods. In Chapter 3, reversible jump MCMC methods are used to sample from the marginal posterior of the knots associated with these two curves. Sampling from such a posterior, however, requires evaluation of the marginal likelihood of the knots. This marginal likelihood can not be calculated. Two sampling methods are thus considered in this chapter; these two methods correspond to two different approximations of this likelihood and are compared on how effectively they penalize models with unnecessarily large values of random effect knots.;In the fourth chapter, a similar posterior is considered. This posterior, however, relies on the decomposition of the random <b>effect</b> <b>curve</b> into orthogonal principal component curves, and restricts the random <b>effect</b> <b>curves</b> to have the same knots as the fixed <b>effect</b> <b>curve.</b> The knots associated with the fixed and random <b>effect</b> <b>curves</b> and the number of significant principal component curves is identified by sampling from their joint posterior distribution of knots...|$|R
