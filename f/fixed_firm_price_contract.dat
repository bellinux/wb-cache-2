40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Small Business Act, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), numerous policy updates, and memorandums direct the Department of the Navys acquisition community to maximize small business awards and increase access by nontraditional suppliers. This Joint Applied Project (JAP) examines the barriers, tools, and best practices {{of small business}} contracting in the simplified acquisition environment, with particular emphasis on targeting requirements and industries for award to small and non-traditional suppliers. Through the Small Business Reservation (SBR), Congress intends that agencies automatically attempt to award contracts below the dollar amount of the Simplified Acquisitions Threshold (SAT) of $ 150, 000. 00 through small business set-asides. In theory, the FAR Part 13 Simplified Acquisitions Procedures (SAP) is a highly effective tool that can overcome barriers to grow non-traditional and small business suppliers to receive experience, revenue, and positive past performance. The Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of the Navy (DON) leaders are concerned the SAT contracts are disproportionately benefitting large firms across entire North American Industrial Category System (NAICS) categories. The SAP environment is a flexible tool in government contracting in which to procure from small business vendors. In December 2011, the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) was granted SAP contracting authority to award <b>fixed</b> <b>firm</b> <b>priced</b> <b>contracts</b> below the simplified acquisition dollar threshold of $ 150, 000. 00. As a result, NPS is in an ideal position {{to serve as the}} test case for an innovative model of fundamental principles which utilizes best practices of small business contracting. Specifically, this foundational model identifies the tools and best practices to overcome the barriers to small business SAT level awards in the Open Market and Indefinite Delivery Vehicle (IDV) contracting vehicles.

In this study it will be determined if the current buying approach utilized by DESC or an alternative approach present a better method to reduce the pricing risks associated with market timing and volatility. In order to determine how market timing and volatility affect purchasing, historical data for actual monthly prices of the current program and data from market pricing indices for a statistical model were analyzed. The data for the current model and the statistical model were compared using averages prices and standard deviation to determine which model provided better overall results.

This project presents an in-depth examination of FFP and FPIF contract types, including definitions, profit mechanisms, and advantages and disadvantages associated with each type. This project reviews three iterations of Better Buying Power, with a specific focus on profitability and the use of FPIF contracts. The project presents and analyzes data collected through interviews with PEO Missiles and Space program management and contracting personnel who support programs that have transitioned from FFP to FPIF. The project also examines defense industry profitability and considers the perspective of defense contractors regarding Department of Defense profit policy. The analysis results indicate that the PEO is appropriately applying guidance for choosing FPIF contracts in follow-on production, and that there are both benefits and challenges associated with FPIF contracts. Recommendations include continuing to assess FPIF use for production programs, obtaining actual cost data, and improving incentive contracting workforce training.

Successful training programs ensure telemetry systems quickly become operational yielding the acquisition of critical test data. Over the years, training programs have been greatly impacted by the changes in defense contracts [...] specifically funding. Today's aggressive telemetry market requires contractors to develop complex telemetry systems within the constraints of <b>Firm</b> <b>Fixed</b> <b>price</b> (FFP) <b>contracts</b> and within very short schedules.

The D&D Focus Area`s approach to verifying the benefits of the improved D&D technologies is to use them in large-scale technology demonstration (LSTD) projects at several DOE sites. The Fernald Environmental Management Project (FEMP) was selected to host one of the first three LSTD`s awarded by the D&D Focus Area. The FEMP is a DOE facility near Cincinnati, Ohio, that was formerly engaged in the production of high quality uranium metal. The FEMP is a Superfund site which has completed its RUFS process and is currently undergoing environmental restoration. With the FEMP`s selection to host an LSTD, the FEMP was immediately faced with some challenges. The primary challenge was that this LSTD was to be integrated into the FEMP`s Plant 1 D&D Project which was an ongoing D&D Project for which a <b>firm</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>price</b> <b>contract</b> had been issued to the D&D Contractor.

40|$|Argonne National Laboratory (ANL-E) has {{recently}} completed the decontamination and decommissioning (D and D) of the JANUS Reactor Facility located in Building 202. The 200 KW reactor operated from August 1963 to March 1992. The facility {{was used to}} {{study the effects of}} both high and low doses of fission neutrons in animals. There were two exposure rooms {{on opposite sides of the}} reactor and the reactor was therefore named after the two-faced Roman god. The High Dose Room was capable of specimen exposure at a dose rate of 3, 600 rads per hour. During calendar year 1996 a detailed characterization of the facility was performed by ANL-E Health Physics personnel. ANL-E Analytical Services performed the required sample analysis. An Auditable Safety Analysis and an Environmental Assessment were completed. D and D plans, procedures and procurement documents were prepared and approved. A D and D subcontractor was selected and a <b>firm,</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>price</b> <b>contract</b> awarded for the field work and final survey effort. The D and D subcontractor was mobilized to ANL-E in January 1997. Electrical isolation of all reactor equipment and control panels was accomplished and the equipment removed. A total of 207, 230 pounds (94, 082 Kg) of lead shielding was removed, surveyed and sampled, and free-released for recycle. All primary and secondary piping was removed, size reduced and packaged for disposal or recycled as appropriate. The reactor vessel was removed, sized reduced and packaged as radioactive waste in April. The activated graphite block reflector was removed next, followed by the bioshield concrete and steel. All of this material was packaged as low level waste. Total low level radioactive waste generation was 4002. 1 cubic feet (113. 3 cubic meters).

40|$|Having {{worked in}} the Employees and Commercial Payments Branch of the Financial Management Division for the past 3 summers, I have seen the many changes that have {{occurred}} within the NASA organization. As I return each summer, I find that new programs and systems have been adapted to better serve the needs of the Center and of the Agency. The NASA Agency has transformed itself the past couple years with the implementation of the Integrated Financial Management Program (IFMP). IFMP is designed to allow the Agency to improve its management of its Financial, Physical, and Human Resources through the use of multiple enterprise module applications. With my mentor, Joseph Kan, being the branch chief of the Employees and Commercial Payments Branch, I have been exposed to several modules, such as Travel Manager, WebTads, and Core Financial/SAP, which were implemented {{in the last couple of}} years under the IFMP. The implementation of these agency-wide systems has sometimes proven to be troublesome. Prior to IFMP, each NASA Center utilizes their own systems for Payroll, Travel, Accounts Payable, etc. But with the implementation of the Integrated Financial Management Program, all the "legacy" systems had to be eliminated. As a result, a great deal of enhancement and preparation work is necessary to ease the transformation from the old systems to the new. All this work occurs simultaneously; for example, e-Payroll will "go live" in several months, but a system like Travel Manager will need to have information upgraded within the system to meet the requirements set by Headquarters. My assignments this summer have given me the opportunity to become involved with such work. So far, I have been given the opportunity to participate in projects resulting from a congressional request, several bankcard reconciliations, updating routing lists for Travel Manager, updating the majordomo list for Travel Manager approvers and point of contacts, and a NASA Headquarters project involving improper payments on <b>firm</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>price</b> <b>contracts.</b> Each of the projects that I have worked on this summer presents a different aspect of the work performed on a regular basis by members of this branch.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the pricing {{behavior of a}} risk-averse monopolistic firm under demand uncertainty. The firm produces a single good at a constant marginal cost. To facilitate sales, the firm uses a two-part <b>pricing</b> <b>contract</b> that includes a membership fee and a selling price per unit. The good is sold to a continuum of heterogeneous consumers who are subject to a common demand shock. We show that the global and marginal effects of risk aversion are to push the unit price closer to the constant marginal cost, and to shrink the market coverage so as to limit the firm's risk exposure to the demand uncertainty. The more risk-averse firm as such charges a higher membership fee to consumers. We further show that {{an increase in the}} fixed cost of production induces the firm to lower (raise) the unit price, to raise (lower) the membership fee, and to shrink (enlarge) the market coverage under decreasing (increasing) absolute risk aversion. The <b>firm's</b> optimal two-part <b>pricing</b> <b>contract,</b> however, is unaffected by changes in the fixed cost under constant absolute risk aversion. Finally, we show that a mean-preserving-spread increase in the demand uncertainty induces the firm to lower the unit price, to raise the membership fee, and to shrink the market coverage under either decreasing or constant absolute risk aversion. The firm's risk preferences as such play a pivotal role in determining the optimal two-part pricing under demand uncertainty...|$|R
