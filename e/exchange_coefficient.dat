40|$|The {{value of}} the {{effective}} <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficient</b> for area-averaged fluxes can depend significantly on the averaging scale. This dependence implies that the <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficient</b> in numerical models should depend on grid size. The main goal {{of this study is}} the assessment of the importance of such scale-dependence. When the large-scale flow is weak, the mesoscale motions on scales smaller than the averaging width (grid size) may generate significant turbulence which is not represented by the area-averaged wind vector (resolved flow). In this case, the effective <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficient</b> must be larger than that predicted by similarity theory in order to predict the grid-averaged turbulent flux. This study reviews different approaches for representation of spatially-averaged surface fluxes over heterogeneous surfaces. The scale-dependence of the effective <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficient</b> is posed in terms of spatially averaging the bulk aerodynamic relationship. This scale-dependence is evaluated in terms of observed fluxes from three different field programs. The effective drag coefficient is found to be more scale-dependent than the effective exchange coefficients for heat and momentum. The effective conductance is found to be less scale-dependent than the effective <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficient</b> and effective resistance. Except for the case of weak flow over strong surface heterogeneity, the <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficient</b> is nearly independent of grid size...|$|E

Thermal bar progression rates were compared with two analytical models; both produced overestimates during {{the early part of}} the thermal bar and underestimates during the late spring. In a zone between the shore and the thermal bar, currents were influenced by the local wind stress and flowed in a counter-clockwise direction.

40|$|To {{examine the}} impact of air-sea {{exchange}} coefficients on the structure and intensity of tropical cyclones, sensitivity experiments are performed using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model. A typhoon-like idealized vortex embedded in a calm environment is simulated using combinations of three different values of air-sea momentum and enthalpy exchange coefficients. In order to investigate the clear roles of each <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficient,</b> the experiments are designed that the two exchange coefficients change independently. For example, while the enthalpy <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficient</b> varies, the momentum <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficient</b> keeps its original value and vice versa. The track and intensity of sensitivity tests are analyzed to check the validity of the experiments. Results show that the track of the idealized vortices under a calm environment remains stationary, while the intensity varies with different air-sea exchange coefficients. The results indicate that changes in storm intensity with different enthalpy exchange coefficients are mainly related to an alteration in the amount of energy input to the storm, whereas the intensity changes with different momentum <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficient</b> values mostly result from angular momentum conservation due to changes {{in the size of the}} vortex. There is little change in the net energy input to the storms when the values of the momentum <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficient</b> are changed.

40|$|This study {{examines}} the bulk aerodynamic method for estimating surface fluxes {{of heat and}} moisture using the surface radiative temperature. The surface radiative temperature is often the only available surface temperature from field measurements. Models typically predict heat fluxes from the surface radiative temperature computed from the surface energy balance. In this study, the corresponding radiometric <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficient</b> and radiometric roughness height are computed from tower- and low-level aircraft data taken during four different field programs. The data analysis shows that the radiometric <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficient</b> does not increase with increasing instability. This is because the radiometric <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficient</b> must compensate for the large vertical temperature difference resulting from use of the surface radiative temperature. The data analysis and scaling arguments indicate that the radiometric <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficient</b> for heat in the bulk aerodynamic formulation {{is closely related to}} θ*/Δθ for both stable and unstable conditions, where Δθ is the difference between the surface radiative temperature and the air temperature and θ* is the negative of the heat flux divided by the surface friction velocity. Application of Monin–Obukhov similarity theory with surface radiative temperature also reduces to a relatively circular internal relationship between the radiometric roughness height and θ*/Δθ. This roughness height is flow dependent and not systematically related to the roughness height for momentum. As an additional complication, the observed radiometric <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficient</b> for heat depends on the relationship between the measured surface radiative temperature and the microscale distribution of surface radiative temperature in the footprint of the heat flux measurement. Analogous problems affect the prediction of the moisture flux based on the saturation vapor pressure at the surface radiative temperature...|$|E

40|$|Exchange of gases, such as O 2, CO 2, and CH 4, {{over the}} air–water {{interface}} {{is an important}} component in aquatic ecosystem studies, but exchange rates are typically measured or estimated with substantial uncertainties. This diminishes the precision of common ecosystem assessments associated with gas exchanges such as primary production, respiration, and greenhouse gas emission. Here, we used the aquatic eddy covariance technique – originally developed for benthic O 2 flux measurements – right below the air–water interface (∼[*] 4  cm) to determine gas <b>exchange</b> rates and <b>coefficients.</b> Using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter and a fast-responding dual O 2 –temperature sensor mounted on a floating platform the 3 -D water velocity, O 2 concentration, and temperature were measured at high-speed (64  Hz). By combining these data, concurrent vertical fluxes of O 2 and heat across the air–water interface were derived, and gas <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficients</b> were calculated from the former. Proof-of-concept deployments at different river sites gave standard gas <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficients</b> (k 600) in the range of published values. A 40  h long deployment revealed a distinct diurnal pattern in air–water exchange of O 2 that was controlled largely by physical processes (e. g., diurnal variations in air temperature and associated air–water heat fluxes) and not by biological activity (primary production and respiration). This physical control of gas exchange can be prevalent in lotic systems and adds uncertainty to assessments of biological activity that are based on measured water column O 2 concentration changes. For example, in the 40  h deployment, there was near-constant river flow and insignificant winds – two main drivers of lotic gas exchange – but we found gas <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficients</b> that varied by several fold. This was presumably caused by the formation and erosion of vertical temperature–density gradients in the surface water driven by the heat flux into or out of the river that affected the turbulent mixing. This effect is unaccounted for in widely used empirical correlations for gas <b>exchange</b> <b>coefficients</b> and is another source of uncertainty in gas exchange estimates. The aquatic eddy covariance technique allows studies of air–water gas exchange processes and their controls at an unparalleled level of detail. A finding related to the new approach is that heat fluxes at the air–water interface can, contrary to those typically found in the benthic environment, be substantial and require correction of O 2 sensor readings using high-speed parallel temperature measurements. Fast-responding O 2 sensors are inherently sensitive to temperature changes, and if this correction is omitted, temperature fluctuations associated with the turbulent heat flux will mistakenly be recorded as O 2 fluctuations and bias the O 2 eddy flux calculation...|$|R
