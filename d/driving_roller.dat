5000|$|... "This {{provides}} a drive which is automatic in variation of ratio within limits, easily set by a finger and thumb lever {{on the top}} of the steering wheel. The actual transmission is through steel rollers which transmit the drive between curved steel races, the ratio being altered by rocking the <b>rollers</b> to different <b>driving</b> positions to engage with differing diameters of the driving and driven races. There are no gears—except for reverse—and a wide variation in ratios is available automatically. The <b>driving</b> <b>rollers</b> are rocked or precessed to give varying ratios by hydraulic means and the driver by his little lever can modify the performance as road conditions require. Subject to the control setting, the automatic functioning ensures a constant engine speed whatever the tractive resistance met with on the road, the transmission varying its ratio to balance the resistance as it increases or decreases. The engine speed by creating oil pressure in the hydraulic control system, tends to precess the rollers to give a high ratio drive. This is counterbalanced by the reaction of the tractive resistance, which tends to give a low ratio precession. A valve worked by the movement of the forward and reverse lever which engages the drive —in the ordinary way and is centrally placed like the ordinary speed lever—releases the pressure in the hydraulic control unit when the lever is in its neutral and reverse positions, so that the drive is always at low ratio for starting from rest or reversing.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, the {{stability}} of a Networked Control System (NCS) with time-varying delays is analyzed. A discrete-time state-space model is {{used to analyze the}} dynamics of the NCS. The delay is introduced by the network itself and is assumed to be upperbounded by a fraction of the sample-time. A typical motion control example is presented in which the time-variation of the delay results in an unstable system, although for each fixed delay the system is stable. Conditions in terms of LMIs are presented guaranteeing the robust asymptotic stability of the discrete-time system, given bounds on the uncertain time-varying delay. Moreover, it is shown that the robust stability conditions also guarantee asymptotic stability of the intersample behavior. Additionally, LMIs are presented to synthesize a feedback controller that stabilizes the system for the uncertain time-varying delay. The results are illustrated on an example concerning a mechanical model of a motor <b>driving</b> a <b>roller</b> in a printer. I...|$|R

Dangerous phenomena which can be in direct connection with the use of conveyor belts are the ones regarding: - sparks influence over the coating layer and/or resistance internal structure of the stopped conveyor belt; - propagation of a flame along the length of a conveyor belt that was exposed to a energy source relative high like a fire or due to blockage of a conveyor belt as a result of the driving mechanism still operating, that generate a local heating of the conveyor belt in contact with the <b>driving</b> drum, <b>rollers</b> or any other heating source generated by friction.

50|$|The kiln {{is usually}} turned {{by means of}} a single Girth Gear {{surrounding}} a cooler part of the kiln tube, but sometimes it is turned by driven rollers. The gear is connected through a gear train to a variable-speed electric motor. This must have high starting torque in order to start the kiln with a large eccentric load. A 6 x 60 m kiln requires around 800 kW to turn at 3 rpm. The speed of material flow through the kiln is proportional to rotation speed, and so a variable speed drive is needed in order to control this. When <b>driving</b> through <b>rollers,</b> hydraulic drives may be used. These have the advantage of developing extremely high torque. In many processes, it is dangerous to allow a hot kiln to stand still if the drive power fails. Temperature differences between {{the top and bottom of}} the kiln may cause the kiln to warp, and refractory is damaged. It is therefore normal to provide an auxiliary drive for use during power cuts. This may be a small electric motor with an independent power supply, or a diesel engine. This turns the kiln very slowly, but enough to prevent damage.|$|R
5000|$|The {{watermill}} {{was sold}} in 1927. Mr Asplin, the miller, closed the sluice gate one night, forgot about it, and by morning {{the house and the}} mill were flooded. He continued milling offal until 1948, when the flume broke, the river taking a different course, and the mill was forced to close.A steam and electric mill was built by Edmund Stapleton in 1890. The mill machinery was railed direct from Thomas Robinson & Son Ltd of Rochdale via a siding from the Midland Railway. The mill opened in 1892, Babcock & Wilcox steam boilers <b>driving</b> the <b>rollers,</b> and grinding grain at the rate of 8 sacks, each of [...] stone, per hour. Water for the boilers to make steam was pumped from the watermill. Production increased to 10 sacks per hour, then 20. Twelve men were employed from the village, and six from other villages. Men from Molesworths quarry, when short of work, came to the mill, but spent more time in the Railway Inn. In 1914, men earned 14 shillings a week and by 1919, 27 shillings a week. The furthest delivery point by horse and cart was to Somerby, but in the 1920s Foden steam engines took over, these being replaced by Yorkshire cross-boiler engines with solid tyres. By 1925, a Dennis petrol wagon was hired from Leicester. This had pneumatic tyres and speeds of 30 mi/h km/h were reached. Flour was then delivered as far away as Coventry and Spalding. Four tons would be carried on the wagon, and four on a trailer.|$|R

40|$|Filament winding technology, {{composite}} tubes, shafts, {{beams and}} spars, fiber undulation effects were {{the topics of}} interest. Analytical models of behavior of filament wound structures were developed. The advantages of the presented analytical methods and numeric algorithms are their mathematical accuracy, fast preparation of data and calculation, and interpretation of results. There are 3 basic models presented. The 1 st one is laminate stacking analysis, the condition for data preparation for further modelling and analysis.

40|$|Concern over {{possible}} construction vibration-induced cracking {{has led to}} {{a radically}} new approach to vibration control: Autonomous Crack Measurement (ACM). This paper describes ACM equipment to measure crack response to both long term weather phenomena and transient, construction vibrations with the same sensor. This new approach is useful for control and assessment of vibrations produced by soil interaction (pile <b>driving</b> and vibrating <b>rollers)</b> or rock interaction (blasting). Its inherently digital nature also allows comparative responses to be communicated broadly to interested regulators and public through real-time polling and Internet display. In addition to describing ACM technology, a case history is presented of crack response to weather and construction vibration. Both short (daily) or long term (passage of a front) weather effects are observable, and can be compared to those produced by vibrations. Direct measurement of that which concerns the public – cracks – provides a control mechanism that is based upon the phenomena of concern itself.

40|$|Two {{experimental}} {{devices were}} designed and manufactured {{to study the}} use of mechanical impact and rubbing (friction and compression) to thresh soybeans pods. Threshing efficiency and seed damage were evaluated. The energy absorbed by pods as they shatter and the energy required to operate both devices were estimated and compared with the energy used by conventional combines to thresh soybeans. ^ The impact device was basically made of two parallel walls which hit the plants in a transverse reciprocating motion. The rubbing device connected pairs of vertical <b>rollers</b> <b>driving</b> two, facing each other, endless belts at different speeds and with adjustable gaps between them. The plants were fed either between the walls or belts to simulate the movement of both devices over a row of plants. ^ The impact device threshed 92. 5 % of the soybeans. Threshing efficiency increased significantly with decreasing levels of pod moisture content. The seed damage was within acceptable levels despite the trend to increase with increasing impact speeds and decreasing pod moisture content. The estimated energy absorbed per pod at 10 % moisture content was 0. 0127 J. The energy used by conventional combines was 20 % higher than that required by the impact device, and around 30 {{times higher than the}} total energy absorbed by pods during shattering. ^ The rubbing device threshed over 92. 5 % of the soybeans from 10 % moisture pods at any belt speed. There was no significant seed mechanical damage. The energy absorbed per pod was 0. 0123 J. The energy used by conventional combines was over 100 times higher than that absorbed by pods as they shattered, 12 times higher than that required by plants (pods and stems), and more than 4 times that required by the rubbing device. ^ Both devices performed satisfactory threshing with little seed mechanical damage and a relatively low level of energy consumption. These results support the conclusion that there is potential to improve soybean harvesting equipment. ...|$|R
5000|$|As {{with other}} traction-type CVTs, {{transmission}} of torque through the NuVinci CVT involves some relative sliding between the torque-transmitting contact patches. This is because, {{for any given}} contact patch, parts of the ball are going {{in a slightly different}} direction and at slightly different speeds than the disc (this phenomenon of traction-type CVTs is referred to as [...] "contact spin"). [...] "The spin velocity (or drill speed) is defined as the difference in the rotational speed of the <b>driving</b> and driven <b>rollers</b> in a direction perpendicular to the contact patch plane. It is caused by the relative difference in surface speeds of both elements across the contact patch and is a major source of power loss in traction drive CVT’s." [...] In all traction-type CVTs, this relative sliding necessarily occurs between surfaces which are under the very high clamping pressures required to ensure torques are transmitted reliably. This relative sliding under high pressures cause transmission losses (inefficiency). Fallbrook Technology refuse to publish any efficiency data for the NuVinci CVT. However, The NuVinci is a variant on the [...] "Tilting-ball drive" [...] type of continuously variable transmission (CVT), and the efficiency of [...] "Tilting-ball drive" [...] type CVTs is typically in the range of 70% to 89%. However, its geometry does differ significantly from the Kopp type of tilting ball variator in the reference in that the NuVinci has its torque transfer contacts on the outside diameter rather than the inside diameter, which puts the idler (an element that reacts clamping load) in compression rather than tension, and because the idler contact surface is not conformal as in the Kopp design. In general {{because of the way the}} CVT is set up, it is more efficient at a 1:1 ratio compared to maximum overdrive or underdrive positions. Independent test results have shown that at 1:1 it is actually more efficient than comparable bicycle internal gear hubs, while at the ratio extremes it is slightly lower.|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{continuous}} galvanizing of rolled sheet steel includes immersion into a bath of molten zinc/aluminum alloy. The steel strip is dipped in the molten bath {{through a series}} of <b>driving</b> motors and <b>rollers</b> which control the speed and tension of the strip, with the ability to modify both the amount of coating applied to the steel as well as the thickness and width of the sheet being galvanized. There are three rolls used to guide the steel strip through the molten metal bath. The rolls that operate in the molten Zn/Al are subject to a severely corrosive environment and require frequent changing. The performance of this equipment, the metallic hardware submerged in the molten Zn/Al bath, is the focus of this research. The primary objective of this research is to extend the performance life of the metallic hardware components of molten Zn/Al pot hardware by an order of magnitude. Typical galvanizing operations experience downtimes on the order of every two weeks to change the metallic hardware submerged in the molten metal bath. This is an expensive process for industry which takes upwards of 3 days for a complete turn around to resume normal operation. Each roll bridle consists of a sink, stabilizer, and corrector roll with accompanying bearing components. The cost of the bridle rig with all components is as much as $ 25, 000 dollars just for materials. These inefficiencies are of concern to the steel coating companies and serve as a potential market for many materials suppliers. This research effort served as a bridge between the market potential and industry need to provide an objective analytical and mechanistic approach to the problem of wear and corrosion of molten metal bath hardware in a continuous sheet galvanizing line. The approach of the investigators was to provide a means of testing and analysis that was both expeditious and cost effective. The consortium of researchers from West Virginia University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory developed several test apparatuses that were designed to work in concert so that the process of developing and evaluating new materials and material combinations could be carried out in the most effective manner. ORNL focused on the long-term effects of static and dynamic corrosion on the hardware. Their efforts have yielded corrosion data in terms of mass loss for a large database of materials for immersion times in excess of 6000 hours. In addition, they have developed a new series of alloy, designated ORNL Alloy 4 -x. Several variants of Alloy 4 were tested for corrosion and wear performance. Another effective method for protecting bearing components is through the use of weld overlays or laser cladding. ORNL worked with several project partners to develop a weld overlay process for cladding of 316 L stainless steel with metallic materials that are much more corrosion and wear resistant. This method provides super-alloy performance that is more affordable. WVU was tasked to study wear of the bearing materials along with mechanisms of dross buildup on the roll surface. A small scale screening test apparatus was developed for the purpose quickly evaluating wear performance of candidate superalloys, ceramics, and coatings {{through the use of a}} ball-and-seat testing combination. This combination uses a fraction of the material used in full-scale bearing applications. With this system, WVU has been able to conduct hundreds of tests on various combinations of materials that mimic a wide variety of operating conditions for the galvanizing lines. The small scale wear tester was used to perform both direct correlation to galvanizing line conditions and to act as a screening mechanism for prototype-scale testing at WVU?s airport bearing materials testing facility. In addition, the studies on the effect of contact pressure and velocity on the bearing wear rate lead to the design and subsequent patent application for a fixed-shaft roll design that has the potential for increasing the bearing life by a factor of 2. The prototype-scale bearing test apparatus was donated by one of our project partners and was relocated to the WVU airport hanger at Morgantown Municipal Airport. This test apparatus uses full-scale sleeve and bushing dimensions and is designed to more accurately mimic the galvanizing line conditions. Through the combination of corrosion, wear, and dross buildup testing, as well as material modeling and thermodynamic analysis, the research team has been able to show that an order of magnitude improvement in material performance is a realistic goal...|$|R
