2500|$|The term Green {{transport}} {{is often}} used as a <b>greenwash</b> marketing technique for products which are not proven to make a positive contribution to environmental sustainability. Such claims can be legally challenged. For instance Norway's consumer ombudsman has targeted automakers who claim that their cars are [...] "green", [...] "clean" [...] or [...] "environmentally friendly". Manufacturers risk fines {{if they fail to}} drop the words. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) describes green claims on products as very vague, inviting consumers to give a wide range of meanings to the claim, which risks misleading them. In 2008 the ACCC forced a car retailer to stop its green marketing of Saab cars, which was found by the Australian Federal Court as misleading.|$|E

The {{increase}} in the number of green-marketed products has resulted in an increase in <b>greenwashing.</b> Some companies market their products as green, while they are not. They then respond with <b>greenwashing</b> to neutralise condemnations from environmental laws and government or to gain competitive advantage. Investigations into the existence of <b>greenwashing</b> in developed countries have shown high percentages. This study was therefore aimed at investigating the magnitude of <b>greenwashing</b> in South African products and determining whether there is a similar trend to other investigated countries. This research study was conducted among six South African magazines, which have different target markets and therefore advertise different product categories. The results indicated that 94 percent of green-advertised products in South Africa were <b>greenwashing.</b> Baby products and cosmetic products had the highest percentage of green-advertised products and <b>greenwashing</b> products. Amongst the sins of <b>greenwashing,</b> which were used to analyse the greenness of the products, the sins of ‘vagueness’ and ‘no proof’ had the highest percentages and were evident in all product categories. The study also determined which target market was most susceptible to <b>greenwashing.</b> The results show that new mothers were more likely to buy green products, followed by women in general. The green claims that showed evidence of highest presence in South African products were BPA-free, Natural, Organic and Pure...|$|R
40|$|The {{marketing}} {{success of}} green products has spawned {{the phenomenon of}} <b>greenwashing,</b> but studies {{on the effects of}} <b>greenwashing</b> on consumers are still limited. Using a 4 × 2 randomized experimental design, this study examines such effects by determining whether consumers respond differently to <b>greenwashing,</b> silent brown, vocal green, and silent green organizations selling hedonic products (perfume) or utilitarian products (detergent). The results show that consumers recognized the green claims in the <b>greenwashing</b> condition, which led to an environmental performance impression in between green and brown organizations but also to more negative judgments about the integrity of communication. Regarding purchase interest, <b>greenwashing</b> organizations performed similarly as silent brown organizations, with significantly lower scores than those of vocal green and silent green organizations. No significant effects of product type and no interaction effects were found. Overall, <b>greenwashing</b> has only limited benefits (perceived environmental performance), poses a major threat (perceived integrity), and has no true competitive advantage (purchase interest) ...|$|R
50|$|Organizations and {{individuals}} are making attempts {{to reduce the}} impact of <b>greenwashing</b> by exposing it to the public. The <b>Greenwashing</b> Index, created by the University of Oregon in partnership with EnviroMedia Social Marketing, allows examples of <b>greenwashing</b> to be uploaded and rated by the public. The British Code of Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing has a specific section (section 49) targeting environmental claims.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Greenwashing</b> (a {{compound}} word modelled on [...] "whitewash"), or [...] "green sheen", {{is a form}} of spin {{in which}} green PR or green marketing is deceptively used to promote the perception that an organization's products, aims or policies are environmentally friendly. Evidence that an organization is <b>greenwashing</b> often comes from pointing out the spending differences: when significantly more money or time has been spent advertising being [...] "green" [...] (that is, operating with consideration for the environment), than is actually spent on environmentally sound practices. <b>Greenwashing</b> efforts can range from changing the name or label of a product to evoke the natural environment on a product that contains harmful chemicals to multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns portraying highly polluting energy companies as eco-friendly.In an academic paper <b>Greenwashing</b> has been defined as [...] "co-creation of an external accusation toward an organization with regard to presenting a misleading green message", indicating that an accusation is necessary to speak of <b>Greenwashing.</b>|$|R
40|$|Consumers are {{conscious}} {{of their ability}} to impact the environment through their spending power. As buying “green” has become increasingly mainstream, <b>greenwashing,</b> or the practice of companies disingenuously spinning their products as environmentally friendly, has become a problem. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), in its Green Guides, takes on the problem of <b>greenwashing.</b> However, its enforcement of violations of the Guides has been minimal. This paper will assess the current U. S. response to <b>greenwashing</b> in general, and specifically, FTC enforcement of the Green Guides. Based on this assessment, the paper will make proposals for the FTC to strengthen enforcement of <b>greenwashing</b> violations, including the adoption of international standards into the Green Guides and the provision of citizen suit enforcement of Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{key elements}} of communication {{that may lead to}} accusations that a company is engaging in practices of <b>greenwashing</b> failing to create stakeholder engagement. According to sensemaking and sensegiving approaches, the theoretical foundations that underpin the concepts of corporate social responsibility (CSR) communication and <b>greenwashing</b> practices are explored and a comparison between two energy companies in the Italian and Dutch context is set up for exploratory purpose. The integration of a company's strategic CSR approach and its communication practices may help to enhance effective stakeholder engagement, prevent accusations of <b>greenwashing</b> and avert the negative associated consequences (e. g., scepticism among stakeholders). The research provides a theoretical contribution to CSR communication by identifying several pitfalls that can lead to the appearance of <b>greenwashing</b> and provides caveats for the further development of both theory and managerial practices...|$|R
50|$|Some {{observers}} {{described the}} entire project as <b>greenwash</b> designed to avoid committing to the Kyoto Protocol, and cited evidence {{that much more}} drastic cuts, up to 40%, could be achieved without affecting investment yield in equities, a good indicator that such cuts would not affect economic prospects in {{the economy as a}} whole.|$|E

40|$|Buying {{firms are}} {{increasingly}} confronted with compliance scandals in their upstream supply chain, {{for which they}} are held accountable by their stakeholders. Purely symbolic practices, typically referred to as <b>greenwashing,</b> as well as substantive practices, such as green supplier championing, are thus receiving widespread attention in business practices and academia alike. In this study, we reveal the impact of two opposing leadership dimensions following the concepts of ethical and transactional leadership as antecedents for green supplier championing and <b>greenwashing.</b> We particularly address whether these antecedents have a complementary or a counterproductive effect on green supplier championing and <b>greenwashing.</b> Furthermore, we investigate the complementary impact of incentives and the two leadership styles on achieving sustainability behavior. The resulting model is tested using a path analysis based on a data set of 118 firms located in Germany. We find support for the positive impact of ethical leadership on green supplier championing but also a non-significant negative impact on <b>greenwashing.</b> <b>Greenwashing</b> is significantly impacted by leadership styles reflecting obedience to authority, and further moderated by ethical incentives. Interestingly, ethical incentives do not moderate the impact of ethical leadership on green supplier championing. Finally, we discuss implications for theory and business practice...|$|R
40|$|Companies in {{the energy}} sector face a dilemma {{regarding}} how to communicate their environmental policies to the public. Communicating that environmental policies and activities are motivated by {{concern for the environment}} could elicit positive reactions, but may also lead to accusations of corporate <b>greenwashing</b> – the idea that companies deliberately frame their activities as ‘green’ in order to look environmentally friendly. The results of three experiments demonstrate that people easily suspect <b>greenwashing</b> when an energy company invests in environmental measures. Importantly, suspicions of corporate <b>greenwashing</b> are reduced by acknowledging economic motives instead of communicating environmental motives for such investments. Suspicion of strategic organizational behavior mediates the effect of communicated motive on perceived corporate <b>greenwashing.</b> This indirect effect occurs primarily among people who are not by nature very skeptical about organizational communications in general. These findings highlight the need to think carefully about how to communicate corporate environmental policies to the public...|$|R

5|$|The term <b>greenwashing</b> {{was first}} used by {{environmentalist}} Jay Westerveld when objecting to hotelier's practice of placing notices in hotel rooms which asked their guests to reuse towels to “save the environment”. Westerveld noted {{that there was little}} else to suggest that the hoteliers were interested in reducing their environmental impacts, and that their interest in washing fewer towels seemed to be motivated by a concern to save costs rather than the environment. Since then <b>greenwashing</b> has become a central feature of debates about marketing communications and sustainability, with “awards” for <b>greenwashing</b> established and numerous campaigns, law and advices developed in an attempt to reduce or curb it.|$|R

One way of {{creating}} a better reputation might be the engagement in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) or Corporate Responsibility (CR) programs. However, since several organizations have been <b>greenwashing</b> their communication (suggesting a responsible attitude without actual backing in behavior), stakeholders have become skeptical when confronted with CR communications. We aim at helping organizations who want to show their activities in this skeptical environment. In order to do so, 1) we describe the dynamics of skepticism, 2) we will give examples of <b>greenwashing,</b> and 3) we suggest ways to avoid the impression of <b>greenwashing</b> and give a fair hearing to real CR programs and strategies...|$|R

This Note argues that <b>greenwashing</b> is a persistent problem for consumers and the environment and that existing laws are not sufficient to prevent it. It suggests that additional federal regulation is needed to curb <b>greenwashing,</b> and that regulation should specifically define terms and be uniform across the country.

40|$|Our {{planet is}} facing an {{environmental}} crisis {{in form of}} an ongoing increase in temperature caused by greenhouse gas emissions generated by humans. Volkswagen was recently proven guilty of <b>greenwashing,</b> claiming to be environmental friendly when in fact conducting poor environmental performance, causing society to react. Previous research states that this form of <b>greenwashing</b> needs to be studied further. The {{purpose of this study}} is to explain whether individual level of customer loyalty has an effect on brand image when <b>greenwashing</b> has been proven. Brand image has been divided into brand attitude and symbolic brand value. The study has a deductive approach and a cross-sectional design was used. The study is of a quantitative nature, handing out an electronic questionnaire in Kristianstad, Lund and Malmo using a non-probability sampling method. This study has found that <b>greenwashing</b> has a negative effect on brand attitude but fails to prove that <b>greenwashing</b> has a negative effect on symbolic brand value. Furthermore, increasing level of customer loyalty has a positive effect on brand attitude but has no effect on symbolic brand value when <b>greenwashing</b> has been proven. Thus, high levels of loyalty can be used to rescue brands in crisis. The limitations of this study are that the results found regarding symbolic brand value were of no significance and Volkswagen as a case may not be suitable for future research. Instead this study enables a generalization of greenwashing’s affect on brand image when moderated by customer loyalty, and can be applied to similar cases. ...|$|R
