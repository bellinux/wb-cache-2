5|$|Eighty {{percent of}} self-harm {{involves}} stabbing or cutting the skin {{with a sharp}} object. However, the number of self-harm methods are only limited by an individual's inventiveness and their determination to harm themselves; this includes burning, self-poisoning, alcohol abuse, self-embedding of objects, <b>hair</b> <b>pulling,</b> bruising/hitting one's self, scratching to hurt one's self, knowingly abusing over the counter or prescription drugs, and forms of self-harm related to anorexia and bulimia. The locations of self-harm are often areas {{of the body that}} are easily hidden and concealed from the detection of others. As well as defining self-harm in terms of the act of damaging the body, it may be more accurate to define self-harm in terms of the intent, and the emotional distress that the person is attempting to deal with. Neither the DSM-IV-TR nor the ICD-10 provide diagnostic criteria for self-harm. It is often seen as only a symptom of an underlying disorder, though many people who self-harm would like this to be addressed.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{recorded}} organized unarmed fighting art in South Asia is malla-yuddha or combat-wrestling, codified {{into four}} forms and pre-dating the Vedic Period. Stories describing Krishna {{report that he}} sometimes engaged in wrestling matches where he used knee strikes to the chest, punches to the head, <b>hair</b> <b>pulling,</b> and strangleholds. Based on such accounts, Svinth (2002) traces press ups and squats used by South Asian wrestlers to the pre-classical era.|$|E
40|$|To help {{determine}} the specificity of “loose anagen” (LA) hairs in Loose Anagen Syndrome, {{the presence or absence}} of LA hairs on a gentle but firm <b>hair</b> <b>pull</b> was evaluated in 110 normal subjects from a 0. 5 to 83 y old. In children ≤ 10 y old, 61 % had LA <b>hairs</b> on <b>hair</b> <b>pull</b> evaluation and 73 % of all hairs obtained were LA hairs. In contrast, LA hairs were found in only two of 87 (2 %) normal postpubescent subjects. The number of LA hairs was small in normal children (1 – 2 per <b>hair</b> <b>pull)</b> and a maximum of one out of every 6 – 7 <b>hair</b> <b>pulls</b> in adults, far less than that reported with Loose Anagen Syndrome. Although the mere presence of LA hairs on a <b>hair</b> <b>pull</b> test is thus not specific for LAS in children, the number per <b>hair</b> <b>pull</b> may have diagnostic significance. Correlation of these findings with the various hair disorder phenotypes currently termed Loose Anagen Syndrome will be important...|$|R

25|$|In {{response}} to the criticism, the UFC increased cooperation with state athletic commissions and redesigned its rules to remove the less palatable elements of fights while retaining the core elements of striking and grappling. UFC 12 saw the introduction of weight classes and the banning of fish-hooking. For UFC 14, gloves became mandatory, while kicks {{to the head of}} a downed opponent were banned. UFC 15 saw limitations on <b>hair</b> <b>pulling,</b> and the banning of strikes {{to the back of the}} neck and head, headbutting, small-joint manipulations, and groin strikes. With five-minute rounds introduced at UFC 21, the UFC gradually re-branded itself as a sport rather than a spectacle.|$|E
25|$|Classical Sanskrit epics {{contain the}} {{earliest}} written accounts of combat in India. The term dwandwayuddha {{referred to a}} duel, such {{that it was a}} battle between only two warriors and not armies. The Mahabharata describes a prolonged battle between Arjuna and Karna using bows, swords, trees and rocks, and fists. Stories describing Krishna report that he sometimes engaged in wrestling matches where he used knee strikes to the chest, punches to the head, <b>hair</b> <b>pulling,</b> and strangleholds. Another unarmed battle in the Mahabharata describes two fighters boxing with clenched fists and fighting with kicks, finger strikes, knee strikes and headbutts. Krishna Maharaja, who single-handedly overcame an elephant according to the Mahabharata, is credited with developing the sixteen principles of armed combat.|$|E

25|$|In March 1997, the Iowa Athletic Commission officially sanctioned Battlecade Extreme Fighting under a {{modified}} form of its existing rules for Shootfighting. These rules created the 3, 5 minute round, one-minute break format, and mandated shootfighting gloves {{as well as}} weight classes for the first time. Illegal blows were listed as groin strikes, head butting, biting, eye gouging, <b>hair</b> <b>pulling,</b> striking an opponent with an elbow while the opponent is on the mat, kidney strikes, and striking {{the back of the}} head with closed fist. Holding onto the ring or cage for any reason was defined as foul. While there are minor differences between these and the final Unified Rules, notably regarding elbow-strikes, the Iowa rules allowed mixed martial arts promoters to conduct essentially modern events legally, anywhere in the state. On March 28, 1997, Extreme Fighting 4 was held under these rules, making it the first show conducted under a version of the modern rules.|$|E
25|$|Fiore's {{body was}} {{discovered}}, but not identified, on Saturday, August 15, 2009 at about 7 a.m. Her badly beaten and crushed {{body was discovered}} inside a suitcase inside a dumpster in an alley in Buena Park, California. According to Buena Park police, Fiore's teeth and fingers had been removed before her nude body was stuffed into the suitcase. She had also been strangled. Authorities believe the mutilation {{was an attempt to}} impede identification. On August 18, her remains were identified using the serial numbers from her breast implants. The Orange County coroner's office reported Fiore had died a couple of hours before her body was found. Fiore's white Mercedes was found abandoned in a parking lot in West Hollywood, Los Angeles, about a mile from the penthouse Fiore shared with Jenkins in Fairfax District, Los Angeles. Police reported that there was a significant amount of blood, and some evidence of <b>hair</b> <b>pulling.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Impulse control {{disorder}} (ICDs) are a {{class of}} DSM diagnoses that do not fall into the other diagnostic categories of the manual (e.g. substance use disorders), and that are characterized by extreme difficulty controlling impulses or urges despite negative consequences. [...] Individuals suffering from an impulse control disorder frequently experience five stages of symptoms: compelling urge or desire, failure to resist the urge, {{a heightened sense of}} arousal, succumbing to the urge (which usually yields relief from tension), and potential remorse or feelings of guilt after the behavior is completed. Specific disorders included within this category include intermittent explosive disorder, kleptomania, pathological gambling, pyromania, trichotillomania (<b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> disorder), and impulse control disorders not otherwise specified (ICD NOS). ICD NOS includes other significant difficulties that seem to be related to impulsivity but do not meet the criteria for a specific DSM diagnosis.|$|E
2500|$|Stereotypies are repetitive, {{sometimes}} abnormal behaviors like pacing on the perch for birds. There are adaptive stereotypic {{behaviors such}} as grooming in cats and preening in birds. Captive parrots commonly perform a range of stereotypies. These behaviors are repeated identically and lack any function or goal. Captive parrots perform striking oral and locomotor stereotypies like pacing on the perch or repetitive play with a certain toy. Feather picking and loud vocalizations can be stereotypies but are not as rigid and may be reactions to confinement, stress, boredom and loneliness {{as studies have shown}} that parrots that are in cages closest to the door are the most prone to feather pick or scream. Feather picking is not a true stereotypy and is more like <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> in human and loud vocalizations or screaming can be a stereotypy but vocalization is part of a parrot's natural behavior. [...] Captive parrots lack sufficient stimulation. Presumably they suffer from lack of companionship and opportunities to forage. [...] Stereotypies can evolve from the social environment for example {{the presence or absence of}} certain social stimuli, social isolation, low feeder space and high stocking density (especially for tail biting in pigs). These behaviors can also be transmitted through social learning. [...] Bank voles, pigeons and pigs when housed next to animals that show stereotypies, pick them up as well as through stimulus enhancement which is what happens in tail biting in pigs and feather pecking by hens.|$|E

60|$|Lastly, for {{altogether}} exceptional crimes, or {{for open}} outbreaks of insubordination, {{there was the}} plete--flogging with a whip of twisted hide, fastened to a handle ten inches long and an inch thick. The lash is at first the same thickness as the handle, tapering for twelve inches, and then divided into three smaller lashes, each twenty-five inches long and about {{the thickness of the}} little finger. This terrible weapon is in use only at three of the Siberian prisons, of which Kara is one. From twenty to twenty-five lashes are given, and the punishment is considered equivalent to a sentence to death, as in many cases the culprit survives the punishment but a short time. The prisoners were agreed that at Kara the punishment of the plete was extremely rare, only being given for the murder of a convict or official by one of the convicts. The quarrels among the prisoners, although frequent, and attended by great shouting and gesticulation, very rarely came to blows, the Russians having no idea of using their fists, and the contests, when it came to that, being little more than a tussle, with <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> and random blows. Had the prisoners had knives or other weapons ready to hand, the results would have been very different.|$|E
50|$|Environment {{is a large}} factor {{which affects}} <b>hair</b> <b>pulling.</b> Sedentary {{activities}} such as being in a relaxed environment are conducive to <b>hair</b> <b>pulling.</b> A common example of a sedentary activity promoting <b>hair</b> <b>pulling</b> is lying in a bed while trying to rest or fall asleep.
