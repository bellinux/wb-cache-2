The pro-posed method indirectly generates the compensation current ref-erence by using an equivalent conductance of the fundamental component using APF’s dc-link voltage control. The proposed con-trol can selectively choose harmonic current components by real-time fast Fourier transform to generate the compensation current. The compensation current is represented in a rotating coordinate system with chosen switching states from a switching table imple-mented in a field-programmable gate array. In addition, a three-phase four-wire APF based on a three-level neutral-point-clamped inverter is also presented. The proposed APF eliminates harmon-ics in all three phases {{as well as the}} neutral current.

40|$|The {{widespread}} use of power electronics in all types of industrial, commercial and even residential electrical equipment is causing {{the deterioration of the}} quality of the electric supply through distortion of the supply voltage. This has led to the development of more stringent requirements regarding harmonic current generation, as are found in standards such IEEE- 519. Passive filters have been used to limit the flow of harmonic currents in distribution systems. However, these tend to be bulky and the design is complex, particularly if the number of harmonic components to be reduced increases. With improvements in power electronic devices and conversion techniques, an innovative concept, the active power filter, has recently been proposed and investigated. Voltage source structures in particular present excellent performance characteristics in three phase configurations. However, in a number of installations, <b>four-wire</b> <b>systems</b> are used. Furthermore, if the three phase load is unbalanced, neutral currents flow and the three phase three-wire active filter cannot adequately eliminate harmonics.
