Taking Jiyu Bridge Station of Wuhan Metro Project as example, the {{deformation}} {{characteristics of}} supporting system of deep foundation pit was studied {{by means of}} numerical simulation (FLAC 3 D) in consideration of construction order. The deformation fields of different <b>excavation</b> <b>depths</b> of diaphram wall were obtained and analyzed {{in order to gain}} the maximum horizontal displacement value and settlement value. By comparison with the monitoring data, the simulation results can basically reflect the deformation characteristics.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the issue of}} {{evaluating}} the effects produced by deep excavations on the built environment in urban areas and historical centres is discussed. Deep excavations unavoidably cause a fi eld of soil deformations affecting the surrounding buildings. A second level probabilistic analysis on these effects is described for a case-study. In particular, a comparison between the obtained results and those estimated by using widely adopted empirical methods is carried out. The aim is to give a contribution towards defi ning probabilistic methods in order to predict buildings damage on varying <b>excavation</b> <b>depths</b> and edge distances and towards supporting design decisions {{taking into account the}} need for both requirements of urban development and protection of the built environment...|$|R

50|$|Gravity sewer systems {{typically}} {{resemble the}} regional runoff pattern with large trunk sewers in each valley receiving flow from smaller lateral sewers extending up hillsides. Sewer systems within comparatively level terrain require careful planning and construction to minimize energy losses in free falls, sharp bends, or turbulent junctions. Every {{reach of the}} sewer should routinely experience the minimum velocity necessary to maintain solids in suspension and avoid blockage from solids deposition in low-velocity areas. Sewers in hilly areas, however, may require energy dissipation features to avoid sewer damage from high fluid velocities and the scouring effects of gritty solids in turbulent flow. Covered sewers are buried below the frost line to avoid freezing, and deep enough to receive gravity flow from anticipated wastewater sources. Long gravity sewers may require significant <b>excavation</b> <b>depths</b> or tunneling to maintain acceptable gradients near the sewer outfall.|$|R

40|$|In the 193 -km crater Tsiolkovsky on {{the lunar}} far side, dark mare {{deposits}} overlie a brighter unit {{presumed to be}} impact melt. Craters impacting through the mare materials commonly excavate the underlying impact melt and form a high-albedo ejecta deposit. Apollo metric photographs of Tsiolkovsky were divided into 25 -sq-km bins, and within each bin a crater was statistically determined to be the minimum size necessary to excavate underlying impact-melt materials. This 'threshold' crater diameter was measured, and the corresponding <b>depth</b> of <b>excavation</b> was determined based on Maxwell's (1973) Z-model calculations. Crater <b>excavation</b> <b>depths</b> were related to mare thicknesses, and an isopach map was derived that shows an average mare thickness of 22. 3 m and a maximum thickness of over 70 m. Based on these data, the most probable average thickness is 116 m with a corresponding mare volume of 1182 cu km. Comparing topographic data to those more accurately determined through impact crater excavation indicates that a possible floor resurgence of up to 95 m may have occurred prior to and during mare emplacement...|$|R
40|$|Theoretical <b>depths,</b> {{volumes of}} <b>excavation,</b> hinge radii, {{ejection}} angles and transient structural rim uplifts are calculated, for comparison with experimental and field data from impact and explosion craters, {{by means of}} a Maxwell Z-model cratering flow field originating at non-zero depths-of-burst. It is found that the formation of a hinge, about which the coherent ejecta flap rotates at the rim of the transient crater, divides material in the flow field into ejected and downward and outward-driven portions. Ejected material originates from an excavation cavity whose geometry is distinct from that of the transient crater. The shallow <b>depths</b> of <b>excavation</b> both observed in impact and explosion craters and predicted by the Z-model flow fields imply that thickness estimates of such lunar geologic units as the maria basalts, which are determined by assuming that <b>excavation</b> <b>depths</b> are similar to (1) final or (2) transient crater depths, must be reduced by factors of two to three respectively.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of equipping diaphragm walls as ground heat exchangers {{to meet the}} full or partial heating and cooling demands of overlying or adjacent buildings has been explored in recent years. In this paper, the factors affecting the energy performance of diaphragm walls equipped as heat exchangers are investigated through finite element modelling. The numerical approach employed is first validated using available experimental data and then applied to perform parametric analyses. Parameters considered in the analysis include panel width, the ratio between the wall and <b>excavation</b> <b>depths,</b> heat transfer pipe spacing, concrete cover, heat-carrier fluid velocity, concrete thermal properties and the temperature difference between the air within the excavation and the soil behind the wall. The results indicate that {{increasing the number of}} pipes by reducing their spacing is the primary route to increasing energy efficiency in the short term. However, the thermal properties of the wall concrete and the temperature excess within the excavation space are also important, with the latter becoming the most significant in the medium to long term. This confirms the benefits of exploiting the retaining walls installed for railway tunnels and metro stations where additional sources of heat are available...|$|R

40|$|We use {{multispectral}} reflectance {{data from}} the lunar Clementine mission to investigate the impact ejecta deposits of simple craters in two separate lunar mare basalt regions, one in Oceanus Procellarum and one in Mare Serenitatis. Over 100 impact craters are studied, and {{for a number of}} these we observe differences between the TiO 2 (and FeO) contents of their ejecta deposits and the lava flow units in which they are located. We demonstrate that, in the majority of cases, these differences cannot plausibly be attributed to uncorrected maturity effects. These observations, coupled with morphometric crater relationships that provide maximum crater <b>excavation</b> <b>depths,</b> allow the investigation of sub-surface lava flow stratigraphy. We provide estimated average thicknesses for a number of lava flow units in the two study regions, ranging from similar to 80 m to similar to 600 m. In the case of the Serenitatis study area, our results are consistent with the presence of sub-surface horizons inferred from recent radar sounding measurements from the JAXA Kaguya spacecraft. The average lava flow thicknesses we obtain are used to make estimates of the average flux of volcanic material in these regions. These are in broad agreement with previous studies, suggesting that the variation in mare basalt types we observe with depth is similar to the lateral variations identified at the surface.

40|$|Based on the {{recovery}} rates for Thalassia testudinum measured {{in this study}} for scars of these <b>excavation</b> <b>depths</b> and assuming a linear recovery horizon, we estimate {{that it would take}} 6. 9 years (95 % CI. = 5. 4 to 9. 6 years) for T. testudinum to return to the same density as recorded for the adjacent undisturbed population. The application of water soluble fertilizers and plant growth hormones by mechanical injection into the sediments adjacent to ten propellor scars at Lignumvitae State Botanical Site did not significantly increase {{the recovery}} rate of Thalassia testudinum or Halodule wrightii. An alternative method of fertilization and restoration of propellor scars was also tested by a using a method of “compressed succession ” where Halodule wrightii is substituted for T. testudinum in the initial stages of restoration. Bird roosting stakes were placed among H. wrightii bare root plantings in prop scars to facilitate the defecation of nitrogen and phosphorus enriched feces. In contrast to the fertilizer injection method, the bird stakes produced extremely high recovery rates of transplanted H. wrightii. We conclude that use of a fertilizer/hormone injection machine in the manner described here is not a feasible means of enhancing T. testudinum recovery in propellor scars on soft bottom carbonate sediments.
