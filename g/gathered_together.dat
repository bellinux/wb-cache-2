5|$|In Germany, {{the battle}} {{was treated as a}} great victory and {{afterward}} no fewer than eight men were awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. The German dead were <b>gathered</b> <b>together</b> and buried in the SS Heroes Cemetery near Arnhem, but after the war they were reburied in Ysselsteyn.|$|E
5|$|In June 1988, a four-foot-tall granite {{memorial}} {{bearing the}} names of Peterson and the three entertainers was dedicated outside the Surf Ballroom with Peterson's widow, parents, and sister in attendance; the event {{marked the first time}} that the families of Holly, Richardson, Valens, and Peterson had <b>gathered</b> <b>together.</b>|$|E

5|$|The first troops reached Madang on 8 February, and {{the whole}} {{movement}} was complete by 23 February. Eighteenth Army anticipated that units reaching Madang, would probably have lost much of their equipment, as was indeed the case, so stores were <b>gathered</b> <b>together</b> from distant Wewak and Hansa, and collected together near Madang. In addition emergency articles such as some food, shoes and clothing were collected {{near the mouth of}} the Minderi River, supplied by the Nakai Detachment.|$|E
5|$|With {{the battery}} in their hands, but no sappers or {{explosives}}, the British <b>gathered</b> <b>together</b> what plastic explosives {{they had been}} issued for use with their Gammon bombs to try to destroy the guns. By this time, Steiner had returned to Franceville-Plage, and directed his regiment's 2nd and 3rd Batteries to fire onto the Merville Battery.|$|E

5|$|Aston and Taylor {{subsequently}} {{decided to}} work together on a new archaeological television series, devising the format for Time Team. Whilst Taylor organised the film production side of the project with Channel 4, Aston located suitable sites to excavate, and <b>gathered</b> <b>together</b> a team of specialists to appear on the show, among them field archaeologists Harding and Carenza Lewis, artist Victor Ambrus, and historian Robin Bush. He knew the actor and television presenter Tony Robinson after they had met on an archaeological course in Greece, and successfully requested that he present the show. From an early stage, they had agreed that every episode would feature a practical process or a re-enactment alongside the field archaeology.|$|E
5|$|At 03:35, the 6th Airborne Division {{headquarters}} landed by glider in the landing-zone {{cleared by}} sappers. Only a few gliders missed the landing-zone, {{due to the}} poor weather and errors in navigation. Once the headquarters staff and accompanying airborne troops had been <b>gathered</b> <b>together,</b> the headquarters {{was moved to the}} Le Bas de Ranville area and set up there. Contact was established with the headquarters of 5th Parachute Brigade at 05:00, and with the headquarters of 3rd Parachute Brigade at 12:35, and the division linked up with 1st Special Service Brigade as it advanced from the invasion beaches at 13:53.|$|E
5|$|Henry's plans shifted {{when the}} Empress Matilda's husband, the Emperor Henry, died in 1125. King Henry {{recalled}} {{his daughter to}} England {{the next year and}} declared that, should he die without a male heir, she was to be his rightful successor. The Anglo-Norman barons were <b>gathered</b> <b>together</b> at Westminster on Christmas 1126, where they swore to recognise Matilda and any future legitimate heir she might have. Putting forward a woman as a potential heir in this way was unusual: opposition to Matilda continued to exist within the English court, and Louis was vehemently opposed to her candidacy.|$|E

500|$|Although Caged Bird was {{refreshing}} in its honesty, something {{its readers}} and reviewers value, Angelou's honesty in <b>Gather</b> <b>Together</b> had become, as reviewer John McWhorter perceives it, [...] "more and more formulaic". McWhorter {{asserts that the}} events that Angelou describes in <b>Gather</b> <b>Together</b> and in her subsequent autobiographies require more explanation, which she does not provide, although she expects her readers to accept them on face value. In <b>Gather</b> <b>Together,</b> for example, Angelou insists {{that she is not}} religious, but she refuses welfare, and even though she was afraid of becoming a lesbian in Caged Bird and presents herself as shy, awkward, and bookish, she pimps for a lesbian couple and becomes a prostitute herself. McWhorter criticizes Angelou for her decisions in <b>Gather</b> <b>Together,</b> and for not explaining them fully, and states, [...] "The people in these flamboyant tales—the narrator included—have a pulp-novel incoherence".|$|R
5|$|Herodotus {{says that}} when the Persians in Asia Minor heard {{of the attack on}} Sardis, they <b>gathered</b> <b>together,</b> and marched to the relief of Artaphernes. When they arrived at Sardis, they found the Greeks {{recently}} departed. So they followed their tracks back towards Ephesus. They caught up with the Greeks outside Ephesus and the Greeks were forced to turn and prepare to fight. Holland suggests that the Persians were primarily cavalry (hence their ability {{to catch up with the}} Greeks). The typical Persian cavalry of the time were probably missile cavalry, whose tactics were to wear down a static enemy with volley after volley.|$|E
5|$|In taking office, Morales {{emphasized}} nationalism, anti-imperialism, and anti-neoliberalism, although did {{not initially}} refer to his administration as socialist. In what was widely termed a populist act, he immediately reduced both his own presidential wage {{and that of}} his ministers by 57% to $1,875 a month, also urging members of Congress to do the same. Morales <b>gathered</b> <b>together</b> a largely inexperienced cabinet made up of indigenous activists and leftist intellectuals, although over {{the first three years of}} government there was a rapid turnover in the cabinet as Morales replaced many of the indigenous members with trained middle-class leftist politicians. By 2012 only 3 of the 20 cabinet members identified as indigenous.|$|E
5|$|Kogălniceanu's {{term was}} {{confirmed}} by the 1869 election, after which {{he was able to}} persuade Alecsandri to accept a position as deputy for Roman. The poet, who had been nominated without expressing his consent, cast aside hostility and became one of Kogălniceanu's main supporters in the chamber. Also then, Kogălniceanu blocked the republican gambit of his friend Ion Ghica, the acting Premier. When Carol threatened to leave the country and let he liberals deal with all subsequent problems, Kogălniceanu <b>gathered</b> <b>together</b> the party's moderates in a decisive show of support for the monarch.|$|E

King then sent Captain Gordon Blainey's A Platoon around the right flank, towards the high ground on Mission Hill which overlooked the battlefield. It was secured by 07:30. In the meantime, some of the 2/6th Independent Company's signallers and headquarters personnel <b>gathered</b> <b>together</b> what ammunition they could, and delivered it to C Platoon at around 07:00. C Platoon then fixed bayonets and continued its advance.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{returned}} to Normandy in 1125 and spent {{about a year}} at the royal court, where her father Henry was still hoping that his second marriage would generate a male heir. In the event that this might fail to happen, Matilda was now Henry's preferred choice, and he declared that she was to be his rightful successor if he should die without a male heir. The Anglo-Norman barons were <b>gathered</b> <b>together</b> at Westminster on Christmas 1126, where they swore in January to recognise Matilda and any future legitimate heir she might have.|$|E
5|$|On {{hearing the}} ambush in the distance, Dodge hurried on toward Fort Hamilton (present-day Wiota, Wisconsin) where he <b>gathered</b> <b>together</b> {{a company of}} 29 mounted volunteers and sped off to {{intercept}} the attackers.

The Kickapoo crossed the Pecatonica River within sight of the pursuing militia, and entered into an overgrown swamp. The militia followed across the swollen river and dismounted when they reached the swamp.|$|E

5|$|Owing to its location, Klis Fortress was an {{important}} defensive position during the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans. The fortress stands along the route by which the Ottomans could penetrate the mountain barrier separating the coastal lowlands from around Split, from Ottoman-held Bosnia. The Croat feudal lord Petar Kružić <b>gathered</b> <b>together</b> a garrison composed of Croat refugees, who used the base at Klis both to hold the Ottomans at bay, and to engage in marauding and piracy against coastal shipping. Although nominally accepting {{the sovereignty of the}} Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand, who obtained the Croatian crown in 1527, Kružić and his freebooting Uskoks were a law unto themselves.|$|E
5|$|Philip was {{now able}} {{to turn to the}} Illyrians, who were still occupying much of upper Macedon (whether agreed by treaty or not). He held an {{assembly}} of the army, <b>gathered</b> <b>together</b> a force of 10,000 men and 600 cavalry and marched into Illyria. Bardylis, hearing of the preparations, sent ambassadors to Philip, proposing peace {{on the basis of the}} status quo. Philip rejected this, insisting that the Illyrians must withdraw completely from Macedonia, so Bardylis instead prepared for battle, raising 10,000 men and 500 cavalry, according to Diodorus.|$|E
5|$|The find of {{a herd of}} six Psittacosaurus {{individuals}} {{killed and}} buried by a volcanic mudflow indicates the presence {{of at least two}} age groups from two distinct clutches <b>gathered</b> <b>together.</b> This find has been taken as evidence for group fidelity and gregariousness extending beyond the nest; the earliest such evidence for any ceratopsian. Even very young psittacosaur teeth appear worn, indicating they chewed their own food and may have been precocial. Another juvenile-only cluster shows that specimens of different ages grouped together. These juveniles may have associated together as a close knit, mixed-age herd either for protection, to enhance their foraging, or as putative helpers at the parental nest. There is no evidence for parental care.|$|E
