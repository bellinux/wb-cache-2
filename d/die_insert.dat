40|$|The double-layer {{combined}} die is {{used for}} its longer life in forging. Autofrettage is a well-known elastic–plastic technology that increases the durability of thick-walled cylinders. This study explores an alternative design method of the double-layer combined die using autofrettage theory. An analytical solution for the autofrettage process of the double-layer combined die is obtained based on Lamé's equation. The relationship between the autofrettage pressure and the yield radius of the <b>die</b> <b>insert</b> is obtained, and expressions of residual stresses and displacements, which {{are directly related to}} geometric parameters, material properties and internal pressure, are derived. The finite-element simulation of a specific case is performed, and good agreement between theoretical calculations and simulation results is found. Furthermore, the effects of important parameters, including the ratio of the plastic area and yield strength of the <b>die</b> <b>insert</b> and the outer diameters of the <b>die</b> <b>insert</b> and stress ring, on the autofrettage effect are investigated. Compared with the conventional combined die, the autofrettaged die can bear larger working pressure, as expected. The use of the autofrettaged die can reduce the amount of expensive material required for the <b>die</b> <b>insert</b> and the working space of the die set, which would benefit the practical forging process...|$|E

First, a correlation between <b>die</b> <b>insert</b> temperature and cooling water outlet temperature is established, {{which can be used}} to deduce local die surface temperatures without destructively inserting thermal sensors into a die from its back. Second, a new on-line thermal management scheme is proposed based on an intelligent real-time monitoring and control system (IRMCS) developed for a <b>die</b> <b>insert</b> containing multiple cooling channels. In this scheme, extra cooling water lines controlled by a pump and solenoid valves are hooked up to each established cooling channel.

40|$|Abstract. The slanted-guide-pillar core-pulling {{mechanism}} {{is the most}} commonly used side core-pulling mechanism in die-casting die. But when filling the die with pressure, aluminum leak frequently happens between lower motion-stopping surface of sliding block and side surface of moving <b>die</b> <b>insert,</b> since the clearance is bigger between side core and core hole. In many improved approaches, changing the lower motion-stopping surface of sliding block into upper motion-stopping surface of it or reducing the lower motion-stopping surface area is the simplest and reliable measure. The sliding block’s setback which occurs in die-casting process can be eliminated effectively and the workload of maintaining die can be reduced by this measure. Common structure of Slanted-guide-pillar core-pulling mechanism in die-casting die The die casting is one of main formed methods for aluminum alloy. If there are holes or grooves or convex plates in sidewall of casting part, the corresponding components in die-casting die must be designed the movable cores which can move in side direction[1]. When the casting part need to be taken out from die, the movable cores must be pulled out firstly before die-opening(otherwise, the die can not be opened). When closing the die, it must be returned.

Hydroforming dies typically have shallow forming channels and open, low curvature surfaces, making them ideally suited for 5 -axis machining. To fully appreciate the benefits and to properly demonstrate the capa-bilities of 5 -axis machining for hydroforming dies, a compari-son of 5 -axis and 3 -axis finish machining was done. Two hydroforming <b>die</b> <b>insert</b> sets were machined on a 5 -axis machine with a tilt/rotary table. The tool paths for 5 -axis machining were generated using custom software based on a modified form of a tool positioning strategy called the principal axis method. The quality of generated 3 -axis toolpaths was verified against the machining times of a third set of die inserts, similar to those machined in 5 -axis, by an independent industrial mould and die manufacturer using a 3 -axis high-speed machine. A comparison of the generated 3 -axis paths versus the 5 -axis paths {{for one of the}} die inserts was made using total finish machining tool path lengths to eliminate differences in machines. The results show that the generated 3 -axis tool paths are longer than the 5 -axis paths by at least 247 %.

Five different variants were applied for the tools: 3 die inserts were coated with three different hybrid layers (PN + PVD type), i. e. AlCrTiN, AlCrTiSiN and CrN, one insert was only nitrided, and one was pad welded, to improve tool durability. The tool wear was analysed and represented by the material degradation on the working surface, based on the 3 D scanning and the material growth of the periodically collected forgings. Additionally, the scanned tools {{were divided into two}} areas, in which it was found, based on the analysis, that various degradation mechanisms are predominant. Microstructural tests and hardness measurements of the analyzed tools were also performed.

40|$|Permissible {{internal}} pressure in dies for cold extrusion {{may be increased}} {{by the use of}} one or two shrink rings. The design essentially boils down to defining the diametrical interference fit of the die/ring assembly. There are two methods of design: analytical one based on Lame’s solution and numerical one based on finite element modelling (FEM). None of these methods includes roughness of the interface surfaces of the <b>die</b> <b>insert</b> and the shrink ring. However, when designing the pre-stressed micro-dies, the interface roughness cannot be disregarded and the classical design of the diameter interference must be corrected. In this paper, a semi-physical modelling of interface roughness (SPMIR) is used as novel method which determines the interference correction value. A set of FEM models created on the base of Abbot-Firestone curves, determined from the roughness profile, enables determination of a contact surface stiffness curve and further the interference correction. Relative correction of the die diameter interference increases with the diameter decrease, which might be recognized as a pre-stressed micro-die assembling scale effect. In the experimental part, three miniature dies, with interface diameter 2. 8 mm and different levels of interface surface roughness, Ra= 0. 16, Ra= 0. 43, Ra= 0. 60, have been manufactured by WEDM. Relative interference corrections calculated by the SPMIR method reached respectively 17. 6, 27. 9 and 43. 3 %.

Pulsed pressure is created via a shockwave generated by the discharge of high voltage capacitors through a pair of electrodes in a liquid-filled chamber. The shockwave in the liquid initiated by {{the expansion of the}} plasma channel formed between two electrodes propagates towards the blank and causes the blank to be deformed into a one-sided die cavity. The numerical model of the EHF process was validated experimentally and was successfully applied to the design of the electrode system and to a multi-electrode EHF chamber for full scale validation of the process. The numerical model was able to predict stresses in the dies during pulsed forming and was validated by the experimental study of the <b>die</b> <b>insert</b> failure mode for corner filling operations.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this article reviews the history of durum wheat variety {{development}} in Canada, and how quality models are developed and continue to evolve in response to market feedback. Key technological factors that shaped durum wheat quality requirements in the 1950 s through the 1980 s were the adoption of the continuous vacuum extrusion process and Teflon <b>die</b> <b>inserts,</b> which placed greater emphasis on pasta appearance. In addition, there was growing awareness that stronger gluten is associated with firmer pasta texture. In the 1990 s the use of high-temperature and ultra-high temperature drying of pasta placed even more emphasis on pasta color, and the increasing use of gluten index and alveograph as gluten strength specifications drove market preference to stronger gluten. Canada continued to release varieties that met these evolving market requirements, and as a result annual production of durum wheat in Canada rose steadily from an average of about 0. 5 million metric tons (MMT) in the 1960 s to 5 MMT today. The remainder of this article summarizes results of some research projects that reflect the scope of durum wheat research at the Canadian Grain Commission. The implications of gluten strength on pasta texture are examined, with particular attention to whether blending extra-strong gluten semolina into weak gluten semolina offers any advantage in pasta texture over blending with moderate strength semolina.

40|$|Abstract. The present {{work has}} been {{undertaken}} in order to investigate the possibilities of improvements in the production technology of aluminium drawn-parts. Past technology does not guarantee the production of high quality elements. Aluminium is difficult to use in sheet-metal working processes, mainly because of a susceptibility {{to the formation of}} aluminium „build-ups ” on the tools, i. e. on the punch and die. The “build-ups ” can be limited or even completely eliminated by a proper selection of the technological lubricants and proper surface treatment of the tools (e. g. surface coatings). In order to determine the influence of some technological lubricants and anti-adhesive layers on frictional resistance occurring during the sheet-metal forming process a typical “strip-drawing ” test has been carried out. 1050 A aluminium strips with thickness of 0. 5 mm have been drawn between two steel <b>die</b> <b>inserts.</b> Tests have been carried out with lubrication and in dry conditions. Additionally, two anti-adhesive coatings- TiN and Cr coatings were tested. Friction coefficients for different frictional pairs have been determined.

40|$|Precise {{measurements}} of pressure difference (1 P) in capillary and slit flow {{of a commercial}} grade linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) were carried out using a multi-pass rheometer (MPR) fitted with stainless-steel <b>die</b> <b>inserts.</b> In addition, the experimental stress field for slit flow was determined from isochromatic retardation bands of the flow-induced birefringence (FIB) patterns by assuming the linear stress optical rule to be valid. The MPR results were compared with steady-state numerical predictions of the viscoelastic integral Wagner model, simulated using a finite element code, POLYFLOW. The effect of slip boundary conditions on the numerical predictions of 1 P and slit principal stress difference (PSD) was investigated; the comparison was made for the capillary 1 P data obtained at two temperatures (170 and 190 C) and the slit results at 170 C. For the lower stress data at 190 C, a good match between experiment and simulation was obtained. At the lower temperature and higher stress {{it was necessary to}} introduce slip in order to match the results. Non-isothermal power law simulations suggest that shear heating effects cannot fully explain the low temperature extreme L/D data. Therefore, we tentatively conclude the necessity to introduce a wall high shear stress slip effect. For the slit geometry, the centreline principal stress difference birefringence tracking shows good agreement with the simulations. It was found that the simulated centreline |PSD | was not very sensitive to the addition of wall slip. However, in order to obtain a good match with the overall pressure difference for the slit geometry, it was again necessary to introduce a slip component at the wall. © 2000 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|The overall {{scope of}} this {{endeavor}} was to develop an integrated computer system, running on a network of heterogeneous computers, {{that would allow the}} rapid development of tool designs, and then use process models to determine whether the initial tooling would have characteristics which produce the prototype parts. The major thrust of this program for ORNL was the definition of the requirements {{for the development of the}} integrated die design system with the functional purpose to link part design, tool design, and component fabrication through a seamless software environment. The principal product would be a system control program that would coordinate the various application programs and implement the data transfer so that any networked workstation would be useable. The overall system control architecture was to be required to easily facilitate any changes, upgrades, or replacements of the model from either the manufacturing end or the design criteria standpoint. The initial design of such a program is described in the section labeled ``Control Program Design``. A critical aspect of this research was the design of the system flow chart showing the exact system components and the data to be transferred. All of the major system components would have been configured to ensure data file compatibility and transferability across the Internet. The intent was to use commercially available packages to model the various manufacturing processes for creating the <b>die</b> and <b>die</b> <b>inserts</b> in addition to modeling the processes for which these parts were to be used. In order to meet all of these requirements, investigative research was conducted to determine the system flow features and software components within the various organizations contributing to this project. This research is summarized...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Life {{is always}} intermixed with death, {{it is never}} pure. Death is pure. Death doesn’t need life. It is its absence. To {{know that we are}} going to <b>die</b> implies to <b>insert</b> death in our own life. This absence-presence of death is what eventuates the symbolical play. This {{represents}} death from several fronts: the scientific, the cultural the philosophical. From the latter, death is thought as the only thing we have: this life...|$|R
40|$|Several axi-symmetric EN 3 B steel {{components}} differing {{in shape}} and size were forged on a 100 ton joint knuckle press. A load cell fitted under the lower <b>die</b> <b>inserts</b> recorded the total deformation forces. Job parameters were measured off the billets and the forged parts. Slug temperatures were varied and two lubricants - aqueous colloidal graphite and oil - were used. An industrial study was also conducted to check {{the results of the}} laboratory experiments. Loads were measured (with calibrated extensometers attached to the press frames) when adequately heated mild steel slugs were being forged in finishing dies. Geometric parameters relating to the jobs and the dies were obtained from works drawings. All the variables considered in the laboratory study could not, however, be investigated without disrupting production. In spite of this obvious limitation, the study confirmed that parting area is the most significant geometric factor influencing the forging load. Multiple regression analyses of the laboratory and industrial results showed that die loads increase significantly with the weights and parting areas of press forged components, and with the width to thickness ratios of the flashes formed, but diminish with increasing slug temperatures and higher billet diameter to height ratios. The analyses also showed that more complicated parts require greater loads to forge them. Die stresses, due to applied axial loads, were investigated by the photoelastic method. The three dimensional frozen stress technique was employed. Model dies were machined from cast araldite cylinders, and the slug material was simulated with plasticene. Test samples were cut from the centres of the dies after the stress freezing. Examination of the samples, and subsequent calculations, showed that the highest stresses were developed in die outer corners. This observation partly explains why corner cracking occurs frequently in industrial forging dies. Investigation of die contact during the forging operation revealed the development of very high stresses...|$|R
