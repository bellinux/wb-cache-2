500|$|After a one-yard Mike Pruitt run, Rutigliano {{called a}} timeout. A short field goal {{would have been}} the safe bet — that was all Cleveland needed to win. Rutigliano, ever the risk-taker, decided to go for a touchdown. The coach was {{reluctant}} to stake the game's outcome on the usually sure-footed Cockroft, who had missed two field goals and an extra point earlier in the game. The play he called was Red Right 88, a passing formation in which a slanting Logan would be Sipe's primary target, while Newsome was insurance. If everyone was covered, Rutigliano told Sipe on the sidelines, [...] "if you <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to force the ball, throw it into Lake Erie, throw it into some blonde's lap in the bleachers." [...] Sipe took the snap, dropped back and threw to Newsome as he crossed to the left. But Oakland safety Mike Davis leaped in front and intercepted the ball, cementing the Oakland win. The Raiders went on to win Super Bowl XV, while Red Right 88 became an enduring symbol of Cleveland's postseason stumbles.|$|E
500|$|On September 9, Feldman threw {{seven innings}} of shutout ball against the Cleveland Indians, leading Texas to a 10–0 win. [...] He struck out five, while giving up five singles, raising his record to 16–4, and tying Sabathia and Verlander for the AL lead in victories. [...] He {{became the first}} Rangers pitcher to win 16 games since Kevin Millwood in 2006. [...] It was his seventh win in a row, eighth {{straight}} road victory (a new Texas record), and 12th road win overall in 2009 (another new club record, and tops in the AL). [...] "I'm not doing anything different on the road than I am at home", said Feldman, who had allowed only one run in the last 26.1 innings. [...] "The preparation is the same. [...] I think it's a pretty humbling game, so you can't get too high or too low." [...] He became the first Rangers right-hander to allow just one run over four consecutive starts. [...] Outfielder Marlon Byrd said: [...] "When you have your ace on the mound, you expect to win. You {{get a couple of}} runs early, and you <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> a 'W' in hand. [...] He has been unbelievable this year when he steps on the mound.... He just keeps getting better." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1939, {{after eight}} years working in films, when her Warner Bros. {{contract}} expired, Farrell left the studio {{and returned to the}} theater. [...] "There's something more satisfying about working in a play. You get that immediate response from the audience, and you feel that your performance is your own. In pictures, you get frustrated because you <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> no power over what you’re doing", Farrell told syndicated columnist Bob Thomas in 1952.|$|E
2500|$|On February 14, 2008, Bai Ling {{was arrested}} at Los Angeles International Airport for {{shoplifting}} two magazines and a package of batteries. It was an [...] "emotionally crazy" [...] day, Bai explained to E! News. She was coping with the [...] "huge problem of breaking up [...] Valentine's Day...wrong boyfriend." [...] She also wrote on her blog after the incident: [...] "Life happens to you {{whether you like it}} or not, sometimes I <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to be so brave to stand in front of the world, and just hope that people will have a tender heart towards you." [...] On March 5, 2008 she pleaded guilty to the charge of disturbing the peace. [...] She was fined $200 (US$700 including the fine and penalties).|$|E
2500|$|In {{her second}} memoir, This 'N That (1987), Davis wrote, [...] "I am still {{recovering}} {{from the fact that}} a child of mine would write about me behind my back, to say nothing about the kind of book it is. I will never recover as completely from B.D.'s book as I have from the stroke. Both were shattering experiences." [...] Her memoir concluded with a letter to her daughter, in which she addressed her several times as [...] "Hyman", and described her actions as [...] "a glaring lack of loyalty and thanks for the very privileged life I <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been given". She concluded with a reference to the title of Hyman's book, [...] "If it refers to money, if my memory serves me right, I've been your keeper all these many years. I am continuing to do so, as my name has made your book about me a success." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, Tom, you've been--very sick," [...] {{answered}} Dick, slowly. [...] "How do <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> now? <b>You</b> <b>had</b> a bad tumble, and we {{were afraid}} <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been killed." ...|$|R
2500|$|Hammond {{was made}} captain of England in 1938 when he {{achieved}} amateur status through {{being given a}} top job in a tyre company. This was {{the age of the}} [...] "Shamateur", when cricketers were given lucrative posts so that they would qualify for amateur status and captaincy of their county and country. He was with the RAF in South Africa during the war, but returned to play in 1945 and in the first full county season in 1946 made 1,783 runs (84.90) including six centuries in seven innings, making him easily the best batsman in England. Though the [...] at the MCC disliked having an ex-professional as England captain Hammond had no rivals to the post. On his arrival in Australia the news broke that he was divorcing his wife of 17 years to marry a South African beauty queen and the press had a field day. Hammond made centuries in his first two innings on the tour, 131 off Northam (with 19 fours and 4 sixes) and 208 against Western Australia, but suffered from fibrositis and let Yardley captain most of the early tour games. Hammond proved to be aloof and distant and at 43 was a generation older than the rest of his team, who held in him awe. Amateur captains used to readily consult their senior professional, but Hammond the ex-pro rarely sought anybody's advice, and [...] "sphinx-like marched from slip at one end to slip at the other, apparently, as Plum Warner wrote of him 'just letting the game go on'". He ordered his batsmen to stay in their crease and not attack the bowling and had his best bowlers running around the outfield between overs. In the Tests his highest Test score was only 37 and simply failed to concentrate as he used to; [...] "When I consider the hours I have spent against men like Grimmett and O'Reilly, never taking the slightest chance and patiently waiting for the loose ball to come along, I cannot understand why in 1946 I tried to hit spin bowlers off their length before I had been at the wicket ten minutes". Although averse to public speaking Hammond was very popular with the Australian public and was cheered whenever he appeared. One newspaper told its readers [...] "See him while you can. Your grandsons will <b>feel</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> let them down if you haven't seen him on their behalf". However, Hammond came [...] "as a cricket god, only to leave a failure both as a batsman and a captain". He retired on his return to England and moved to South Africa, where he remained detached from cricket until he took to the habit of visiting M.J.K. Smith's touring team just before he died in a car accident in 1965.|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{can only}} guess.
