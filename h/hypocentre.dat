2500|$|In June 2007, {{scientists}} from the University of Bologna identified a lake in the Tunguska region as a possible impact crater from the event. They do not dispute that the Tunguska body exploded in mid-air but believe that a ten-metre fragment survived the explosion and struck the ground. Lake Cheko is a small, bowl-shaped lake approximately [...] north-northwest of the <b>hypocentre.</b> The hypothesis has been disputed by other impact crater specialists. A 1961 investigation had dismissed a modern origin of Lake Cheko, saying {{that the presence of}} metres-thick silt deposits at the lake's bed suggests an age of at least 5,000 years, but more recent research suggests that only a metre or so of the sediment layer on the lake bed is [...] "normal lacustrine sedimentation", a depth indicating a much younger lake of about 100 years. Acoustic-echo soundings of the lake floor provide support for the hypothesis that the lake was formed by the Tunguska event. The soundings revealed a conical shape for the lake bed, which is consistent with an impact crater. Magnetic readings indicate a possible metre-sized chunk of rock below the lake's deepest point that may be a fragment of the colliding body. Finally, the lake's long axis points to the <b>hypocentre</b> of the Tunguska explosion, about [...] away. Work is still being done at Lake Cheko to determine its origins.|$|E

40|$|Summary. The Wellington region lies on {{the border}} between the Pacific and Australian plates, the former being subducted. The plate {{interface}} lies at shallow depth under the region (10 - 60 km) so that detailed and long-term monitoring of the seismicity of the zone where large thrust earthquakes are expected to occur is possible. <b>Hypocentres</b> for events recorded by a 12 station seismic network for the period 1978 - 1982 (7231 events) have been refined by the use of a threedimensional velocity model derived from a simultaneous inversion of arrival-time data from 129 local events for both <b>hypocentres</b> and velocity. The <b>hypocentres</b> show that the subducting Pacific Plate is defined by a NW dipping zone of relatively intense activity. The plate interface, as given by the upper envelope of this activity, is offset vertically, by 7 km on average, along a NW-SE line through Cook Strait parallel to the direction of absolute motion of the Pacific plate rather than to the direction of convergence. The strike of the interface at deeper levels also changes across this line. This distortion may partly reflect effects of the transition t...|$|R

50|$|A complex {{sequence}} of ruptures {{with a combined}} magnitude of 7.8 started at 00:02:56 NZDT on 14 November 2016 and lasted approximately two minutes. The <b>hypocentre</b> (the point where the ruptures started) was {{at a depth of}} 15 kilometres (9 mi). The epicentre (the point on the Earth's surface above the <b>hypocentre)</b> was 15 km north-east of Culverden and 95 km from Christchurch. From the <b>hypocentre,</b> ruptures ripped northwards at a speed of 2 km per second, over a distance of up to 200 km (124 mi). The largest amount of energy released did not occur at the epicentre, rather 100 km (62 mi) to the north near Seddon. Field surveys indicate ruptures on at least six faults. The earthquake has been assessed as the 'most complex earthquake ever studied' and has meant the reassessment of a number of assumptions about earthquake processes.|$|E
50|$|After 1792, {{the volcano}} {{remained}} dormant until November 1989 when an earthquake swarm began about 20 km underneath and 10 km west of Fugendake. Over the following year, earthquakes continued, their <b>hypocentres</b> gradually migrating towards the summit.

40|$|The space {{distribution}} of the <b>hypocentres</b> of earthquakes {{that occurred in the}} Kwanto District within the last 12 years was statistically investigated. As is well known, the epicentres of earthquakes in this district are most closely distributed in two regions, namely, the northern part of Tokyo Bay and the region along the rivers Kinugawa and Tonegawa. Generally speaking, earthquakes are most frequent from depth of from 70 to 80 km in the former region, and from depth of from 40 to 50 km in the latter region, as already pointed out by Dr. T. Kodaira. The writer found however that, in the last 5 years (1931 ～ 1935), there were hardly any <b>hypocentres</b> beneath 60 km in the former region, whereas in the preceding 7 years (1924 ～ 1930) they were most frequent from depth of from 70 to 80 km in the same region. This fact may be regarded as showing that the instability caused in {{the lower part of the}} earth's crust as the result of the Kwanto Earthquake of 1923 is gradually diminishing...|$|R
40|$|Relative {{relocation}} {{methods are}} commonly used to precisely relocate earthquake clusters consisting of similar waveforms. Repeating waveforms are often recorded at volcanoes, where, however, the crust structure is expected to contain strong heterogeneities and therefore the 1 D velocity model assumption that is made in most location strategies {{is not likely to}} describe reality. A peculiar cluster of repeating low-frequency seismic events was recorded on the south flank of Katla volcano (Iceland) from 2011. As the <b>hypocentres</b> are located at the rim of the glacier, the seismicity may be due to volcanic or glacial processes. Information on {{the size and shape of}} the cluster may help constraining the source process. The extreme similarity of waveforms points to a very small spatial distribution of <b>hypocentres.</b> In order to extract meaningful information about size and shape of the cluster, we minimize uncertainty by optimizing the cross-correlation measurements and relative-relocation process. With a synthetic test we determine the best parameters for differential-time measurements and estimate their uncertainties, specifically for each waveform. We design a relocation strategy to work without a predefined velocity model, by formulating and inverting the problem to seek changes in both location and slowness, thus accounting for azimuth, take-off angles and velocity deviations from a 1 D model. We solve the inversion explicitly in order to propagate data errors through the calculation. With this approach we are able to resolve a source volume few tens of meters wide on horizontal directions and around 100 meters in depth. There is no suggestion that the <b>hypocentres</b> lie on a single fault plane and the depth distribution indicates that their source is unlikely to be related to glacial processes as the ice thickness is not expected to exceed few tens of meters in the source area...|$|R

40|$|Precise {{relative}} <b>hypocentres</b> of seismic events {{induced by}} long-term fluid injection at the ParadoxValleyUnit (PVU) brine disposal well provide {{constraints on the}} subsurface geological structure and compliment information available from deep seismic reflection and well data. We use the 3 -D spatial distribution of the <b>hypocentres</b> to refine the locations, strikes, and throws of subsurface faults interpreted previously from geophysical surveys and to infer the existence of previously unidentified subsurface faults. From distinct epicentre lineations and focal mechanism trends, we identify a set of conjugate fracture orientations consistent with shear-slip reactivation of late-Palaeozoic fractures over a widespread area, {{as well as an}} additional fracture orientation present only near the injection well. We propose simple Mohr–Coulomb fracture models to explain these observations. The observation that induced seismicity preferentially occurs along one of the identified conjugate fracture orientations can be explained by a rotation {{in the direction of the}} regional maximum compressive stress from the time when the fractures were formed to the present. Shear slip along the third fracture orientation observed near the injection well is inconsistent with the current regional stress field and suggests a local rotation of the horizontal stresses.

The {{ability to}} locate the <b>hypocentres</b> of {{earthquakes}} occurring along ridge crests and fracture zones accurately is a prerequisite to solving several problems associated with seafloor tectonics and oceanic crustal formation.
