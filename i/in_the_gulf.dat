5|$|At the time, Jeanne was one {{of three}} November hurricanes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico; it was the first {{tropical}} cyclone to attain hurricane strength <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico during November. The late season storm surprised maritime interests, and two barges broke free from towing vessels. Indirectly, the hurricane produced heavy precipitation that peaked at 23.28inches (591mm) in Key West. Minor beach erosion occurred along the Texas coast, where tides were two to four feet above normal; coastal flooding affected the state, which was heavily impacted by tropical cyclones in August and September. Jeanne caused no deaths.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Cindy was a {{tropical}} cyclone that briefly reached minimal hurricane strength <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico during July in the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season and made landfall in Louisiana. It {{was the third}} named storm and first hurricane of the season. Cindy was originally {{thought to have been}} {{a tropical}} storm at peak strength, but was upgraded to a Category1 hurricane in the post-storm analysis. Cindy initially formed on July3 just east of the Yucatán Peninsula in the Caribbean Sea. The depression soon made landfall on the peninsula and weakened before reemerging <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico on July4. The storm strengthened as it moved north becoming a hurricane just before making landfall near Grand Isle, Louisiana, on July5. The storm weakened as it moved overland and became extratropical on July7.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Cindy was {{the first}} {{hurricane}} to form <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico since 1960. The third named storm of the 1963 Atlantic hurricane season, Cindy developed within a trough as a tropical storm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico on 16September. The disturbance swiftly intensified to hurricane strength, with a distinct eye becoming visible on satellite imagery as it drifted north-northwestwards toward the Texas coastline. Despite favorable conditions, with high sea surface temperatures, the storm only intensified into a Category1 hurricane. After peaking with 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h), it made landfall at High Island {{on the morning of}} 17September as a slightly weaker system with an atmospheric pressure of 996mbar (hPa; 29.41inHg). Cindy remained nearly stationary for almost a day, dropping copious rainfall over the Texas coastal plain, before finally turning west-southwestward and dissipating west of Corpus Christi on 20September.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ingrid {{was one of}} two {{tropical}} cyclones, {{along with}} Hurricane Manuel, to strike Mexico within a 24‑hour period, the first such occurrence since 1958. Ingrid was the ninth named storm and second hurricane of the 2013 Atlantic hurricane season. It formed on September12 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico from a broad disturbance that also spawned Manuel in the eastern Pacific. After initially moving westward toward Veracruz, Ingrid turned northeastward away from the coast. Favorable conditions allowed it to attain hurricane status on September14, and the next day Ingrid attained peak winds of 140km/h (85mph). Subsequently, increased wind shear weakened the convection as the storm turned more to the northwest and west. On September16, Ingrid made landfall just south of La Pesca, Tamaulipas in northeastern Mexico as a strong tropical storm, and dissipated the next day. The hurricane was also the last one to form <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gulf</b> of Mexico until Hurricane Hermine in 2016.|$|E
