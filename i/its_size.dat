5|$|In 1945, the M.D. Anderson Foundation {{formed the}} Texas Medical Center. After the war, Houston's economy reverted to being {{primarily}} port-driven. In 1948, the city annexed several unincorporated areas, more than doubling <b>its</b> <b>size.</b> Houston proper {{began to spread}} across the region.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to housing a supplementary section on George VI varieties, the 61st edition was redesigned with fewer pages and <b>its</b> <b>sizing</b> was increased to 7” x 9”, spiral bound. Tables carried up to 12 pricing columns.|$|R
50|$|Rawa Pening is {{estimated}} to have been formed between 18,000 and 13,500 BC {{after a period of}} increased precipitation. It reached <b>its</b> largest <b>size</b> from 11,000 to 9,000 BC, but shrank until it reached <b>its</b> current <b>size</b> around 6,000 BC.|$|R
5|$|In 2005, a $310.7 million {{expansion}} for the Colorado Convention Center was completed, doubling <b>its</b> <b>size.</b> The {{hope was}} the center's expansion would elevate {{the city to}} one of the top 10 cities in the nation for holding a convention.|$|E
5|$|It was {{formerly}} considered a possible dwarf planet for <b>its</b> <b>size,</b> {{but it is}} no longer considered such because its shape departs significantly from an ellipsoid.|$|E
5|$|Public opinion seems “guardedly supportive, with a {{majority}} of residents saying they favor it”. A poll taken by a local newspaper among 500 Cologne residents showed that the project is supported by 63%, of whom 27% want <b>its</b> <b>size</b> to be reduced.|$|E

5|$|The Flowing Hair dollar was {{the first}} dollar coin issued by the United States federal government. The coin was minted in 1794 and 1795; <b>its</b> <b>size</b> and weight {{were based on the}} Spanish dollar, which was popular in trade {{throughout}} the Americas.|$|E
5|$|The grey-headed {{flying fox}} is {{long-lived}} for a mammal of <b>its</b> <b>size.</b> Individuals reportedly survived in captivity {{for up to}} 23 years, and a maximum age of up to 15 years seems possible in the wild.|$|E
5|$|The musket, or musquet, {{originally}} {{a kind of}} crossbow bolt, and later a small cannon, was named after the male Eurasian sparrowhawk because of <b>its</b> <b>size.</b> The British Gloster Aircraft Company named one of their Mars series craft the Sparrowhawk.|$|E
50|$|Due to <b>its</b> small <b>size,</b> a {{considerable}} number could be carried; however, <b>its</b> small <b>size</b> also made the weapon dangerous when wearing gloves, as {{the impact of the}} striker on the primer was difficult to feel. These grenades were in service from the late 1960s to at least 2008.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aspect ratio}} of a {{geometric}} shape is {{the ratio of}} <b>its</b> <b>sizes</b> in different dimensions. For example, the aspect ratio of a rectangle is the ratio of its longer side to its shorter sidethe ratio of width to height, when the rectangle is oriented as a [...] "landscape".|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{there is}} an enigmatic eucarid species, Amphionides reynaudii, which is the sole {{representative}} of its order, but due {{to the loss of}} several features resulting from <b>its</b> small <b>size,</b> <b>its</b> classification has been unclear.|$|R
5|$|The protest was {{notable for}} <b>its</b> <b>size</b> and the {{composition}} of its participants, {{as well as for}} its success in derailing the copper plant project. It was {{one of a growing number}} of large-scale environmental protests in China that achieved success.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 were next, {{passing by}} Ganymede in 1979. They refined <b>its</b> <b>size,</b> {{revealing}} it {{was larger than}} Saturn's moon Titan, which was previously {{thought to have been}} bigger. The grooved terrain was also seen.|$|E
5|$|A {{growing number}} of astronomers argued for Pluto to be declassified as a planet, because many similar objects {{approaching}} <b>its</b> <b>size</b> {{had been found in}} the same region of the Solar System (the Kuiper belt) during the 1990s and early 2000s. Pluto was found to be just one small body in a population of thousands.|$|E

5|$|Adrastea {{is one of}} the few moons in the Solar System {{known to}} orbit its planet in less than the length of that planet's day. It orbits at the edge of Jupiter's Main Ring and is thought to be the main {{contributor}} of material to the Rings of Jupiter. Despite observations made in the 1990s by the Galileo spacecraft, very little is known about the moon's physical characteristics other than <b>its</b> <b>size</b> and the fact that it is tidally locked to Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians {{possess a}} pancreas, liver and gall bladder. The liver is usually large with two lobes. <b>Its</b> <b>size</b> is {{determined}} by its function as a glycogen and fat storage unit, and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up. Adipose tissue is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen (in internal structures called fat bodies), under the skin and, in some salamanders, in the tail.|$|E
5|$|Based on <b>its</b> <b>size,</b> the {{morphology}} of its molars, and microwear {{analysis on}} its teeth, Babakotia radofilai was likely a folivore, while supplementing its diet with fruit and hard seeds. In all sloth lemurs, including Babakotia radofilai, the permanent teeth erupted early, a trait seen in indriids that improves survivability of juveniles {{during the first}} dry season following weaning.|$|E

5|$|Benson in 2010 {{concluded}} from <b>its</b> <b>size</b> {{and common}} distribution that Megalosaurus was the apex predator of its habitat. He saw {{the absence of}} Cetiosaurus on the French Armorican Massif as an indication that Megalosaurus too did not live on that island and {{was limited to the}} London-Brabant Massif.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{speculates that}} the {{predicted}} planet {{is most likely}} an ejected ice giant, similar in composition to Uranus and Neptune: a mixture of rock and ice with a small envelope of gas. Based on <b>its</b> <b>size,</b> the considerable gravitational pull of Planet Nine could theoretically promote life in subsurface oceans with liquid water in nearby moons. Subsurface oceans have been discovered on the moons Enceladus (water), Dione (possibly water), and subsurface water is postulated for Neptune's largest moon Triton, and possibly also found on Europa.|$|E
5|$|Dactyl {{may have}} {{originated}} {{at the same}} time as Ida, from the disruption of the Koronis parent body. However, it may have formed more recently, perhaps as ejecta from a large impact on Ida. It is extremely unlikely that it was captured by Ida. Dactyl may have suffered a major impact around 100 million years ago, which reduced <b>its</b> <b>size.</b>|$|E
