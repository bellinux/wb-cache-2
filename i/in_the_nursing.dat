5|$|As Mulder and Scully investigate, they {{discover}} a Malaysian orderly is illicitly giving the patients an herbal drug made of mushrooms he {{cultures in the}} building's basement. The drug cures their Alzheimer's, but also allows them to see the spirits {{of people who have}} died <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> home and channel them into existence. In this state, the spirits assault and murder the orderlies that have looked down on them and treated them poorly while they were patients. When a patient overdoses on the drug, the spirits once again attack Charters, trapping her and Mulder in the bathroom, which begins flooding.|$|E
5|$|The doctor tells Scully that Emily {{is getting}} worse. A {{woman from the}} {{adoption}} agency arrives and wants to stop Scully from making decisions for Emily. Mulder connects {{the names of the}} women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> home to recent births and finds that Dr. Calderon was treating them. Emily reacts badly to being placed in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber. Mulder finds medical records with Scully's name on them at the nursing home, along with a live fetus in a refrigerated chamber. Mulder finds Calderon entering soon after, and Detective Kresge arrives as well. Mulder and Kresge confront Calderon, who attacks Kresge. Despite Mulder's warning Kresge shoots Calderon, whose wounds cause him to spew green blood which incapacitates Kresge. Mulder quickly leaves the building to avoid being affected by the blood. Calderon morphs into Kresge, and deceives Mulder and escapes. Mulder returns to the hospital, where Emily has gone into a coma. Days later Emily has died. Mulder visits Scully at the funeral chapel, telling her that Kresge is recovering and all evidence at the nursing home and Prangen is gone. The only evidence left is Emily's body, but the agents instead find sand bags in her coffin along with Scully's cross necklace, which she had previously given to Emily.|$|E

50|$|Once {{the gene}} that is {{disrupted}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bicoid mutant was identified, it was shown that bicoid mRNA is transcribed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nurse</b> cells and then relocalized to the oocyte. Other maternal effect mutants either affect products that are similarly produced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nurse</b> cells and act <b>in</b> <b>the</b> oocyte, or parts of the transportation machinery that are required for this relocalization. Since these genes are expressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> (maternal) <b>nurse</b> cells and not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> oocyte or fertilised embryo, the maternal genotype determines whether they can function.|$|R

25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{interest}} in international mobility, there is little permanency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> positions in the Philippines. Most RNs choose to sign short-term contracts that will allow for more flexibility to work overseas. Filipino nurses feel less committed to the hospitals as they are temporary staff members. This lack of attachment and minimal responsibility worsens the health of Filipino patients.|$|E

25|$|To work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> profession, all nurses {{hold one}} or more {{credentials}} depending on their scope of practice and education. A licensed practical nurse (LPN) (also {{referred to as a}} licensed vocational nurse, registered practical nurse, enrolled nurse, and state enrolled nurse) works independently or with a registered nurse (RN). The most significant differentiation between an LPN and RN is found in the requirements for entry to practice, which determines entitlement for their scope of practice. For example, Canada requires a bachelor's degree for the RN and a two-year diploma for the LPN. A registered nurse provides scientific, psychological, and technological knowledge in the care of patients and families in many health care settings. Registered nurses may earn additional credentials or degrees.|$|E

Marlena is revealed to have died a few years before Jacob was put into the nursing home. After finding out no-one is coming for him, Jacob makes his way to the circus next to the nursing home on his own. He meets the manager Charlie and after the show begs to be allowed to stay with the circus selling tickets, Charlie agrees and Jacob believes he has finally come home.|$|E
25|$|On the October 3, 2009 {{episode of}} NPR's Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!, McCaskill spoke about a {{vacation}} {{early in her}} career as a lawyer, where she was a contestant on High Rollers. McCaskill would reign as champion for four days, and later sold several of her prizes to pay off her student loan debt. In April 2002, McCaskill married St. Louis businessman Joseph Shepard. Shepard lent $1.6 million to McCaskill's 2004 gubernatorial campaign and also had business interests <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> home industry. Because as state auditor McCaskill was responsible for auditing the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, which regulates the state's nursing home system, Shepard's financial interests in the industry became an issue during the 2004 gubernatorial campaign.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDrosophila bicoid mRNA is {{synthesized}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nurse</b> {{cells and}} {{transported to the}} oocyte where microtubules and Exuperantia protein mediate localization to the anterior pole.

Nonetheless, bicoid mRNA injected into <b>the</b> <b>nurse</b> cell cytoplasm, withdrawn, and injected into a second oocyte shows microtubule-dependent transport to <b>the</b> anterior cortex. <b>Nurse</b> cells require microtubules and Exuperantia to support anterior transport of bicoid mRNA, and microtubules are required for bicoid mRNA-Exuperantia particle coassembly.

The nursing school, which had been an integral part of Hamline since 1940 and had won wide recognition for the excellence of its program, was discontinued in 1962 following a decision to concentrate resources and staff on liberal arts programs. The last class in the three-year program graduated in 1960 and the last class in the degree program graduated in 1962. A total of 447 women completed the degree program, and 758 women finished the three-year program.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{enactment}} of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, the Philippines became the largest source of Asian immigration, providing one fourth of the total Asian immigrants. After 1965 and until at least the 1990s, Filipinos were the largest number of Asians immigrating into the United States, and the second largest immigration population other than Mexicans. Into the 1990s, Filipino immigrants included many highly educated and higher skilled immigrants. A significant portion of these immigrants were in the medical field, due to medical personnel shortages in the United State such as in nursing, making the Philippines become the largest source of healthcare professionals to the United States. In the 1960s, nurses from the Philippines became the largest group of nurses immigrating to the United States, surpassing nurses immigrating to the United States from Canada. By the 1970s Filipinos made up 60 percent (9,158) of nurses immigrating to the United States, with Canadians being a distant second (3,034). By 2000, 1 in 10 Filipino Americans were employed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nursing</b> field, with there being an estimate of 100,000 Filipino American nurses. Another result of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 was that family reunification based immigration added to the total amount of Filipino immigrants resulting in two distinct economic groups within the Filipino American community.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the meaning that pediatric death acquires <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nurse’s</b> quotidian.

It was identified that death is a frequent event which is considered complex by those involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> direct assis­tance to the children. The feeling of powerlessness for facing death causes suffering <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>nurse</b> who uses <b>the</b> spirituality to cope with the situation. It was concluded that working with death in childhood is a hard situation, once <b>the</b> training of <b>nurses</b> is dedicated to life-saving and not to issues involving human finitude, especially in childhood. Facing a death situation in childhood is a difficult task, for which <b>the</b> <b>nurse</b> must be prepared...|$|R
