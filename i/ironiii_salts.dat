Selective wetting of both self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of alkanethiolates on gold and alkylsiloxanes on Si/SiO 2 formed by microcontact printing limited the deposition of the iron oxides to the hydrophilic areas on the surfaces; thereby, the chemical functionality of the hydrophilic SAM had only a minor influence on the wetting behavior and the deposition.

The carbohydrates deoxyribose, deoxygalactose and deoxyglucose were substantially degraded by the iron(II) <b>salt</b> and the <b>iron(III)</b> <b>salt</b> {{in the presence of a}}n O 2. - -generating system, whereas deoxyinosine, deoxyadenosine and benzoate were not. Addition of EDTA to the reaction systems producing radicals greatly enhanced damage to deoxyribose, deoxyinosine, deoxyadenosine and benzoate, but decreased damage to deoxygalactose and deoxyglucose. Further, OH. scavengers were effective inhibitors only when EDTA was present. Inhibition by catalase and desferrioxamine confirmed that H 2 O 2 and iron salts were essential for these reactions. The results suggest that, in the absence of EDTA, iron ions bind to the carbohydrate detector molecules and bring about a site-specific reaction on the molecule. This reaction is poorly inhibited by most OH. scavengers, but is strongly inhibited by scavengers such as mannitol, glucose and thiourea, which can themselves bind iron ions, albeit weakly.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop a process for the continuous removal of heavy metals from waste water using magnetic separators. Investigations concerning the formation of magnetite (Fe_ 3 O_ 4) and heavy-metal ferrites (MFe_ 2 O_ 4) were carried out. By the addition of these mostly ferri- or ferromagnetic substances, the magnetic properties of mixed precipitation products can be improved such that satisfactory separation efficiencies can be achieved even at moderate flux densities. When selecting the reaction temperature, ion concentrations and oxidation conditions, particular attention was paid to them being practicable in waste water treatment. The reaction variants which were applied included (1) the oxidation of an iron(II) -hydroxide suspension with air ('oxidation method') and (2) the hydroxide precipitation of iron(II) and <b>iron(III)</b> <b>salt</b> solutions ('mixing method'). The solids generated were characterised using various solid-state analytical methods and investigated with regard to their magnetic properties. Depending on the reaction conditions chosen, the precipitates were varying mixtures of the following solids: magnetite, maghemite, geothite, #delta#-FeOOH and amorphous iron(III) -oxide hydrates mostly containing sulphate. With up to about 1 mg L"-" 1 min"-" 1 oxygen being supplied to the reactor ('oxidation method'), magnetite was seen to be formed sufficiently at temperatures equal to and above 15 C. Using the 'mixing method' this was already achieved at a temperature of 5 C. Increasing concentrations of heavy-metal ions (e. g.

40|$|Long before {{digital imaging}} was so common, {{photography}} relied on light-induced chemical reactions to produce images. For over a century, the photochemical reactions of silver salts dominated this market, but {{the reactions of}} other photosensitive salts containing iron or chromium have also been used to generate photographs {{as far back as}} the 1840 s. These “alternative” processes have been rediscovered by modern photographers who are interested in making one-of-a-kind prints from digitally-captured images. The science of many alternative photographic processes has long been overlooked. The ferric-gum photographic development technique is such a process. It relies on the hardening of the binder in watercolor paint (gum Arabic) when it contacts paper containing a salt called iron(III) chloride. Prior to applying the paint, the paper is saturated with iron(III) chloride, then exposed to ultraviolet light through a transparency of a digitally-recorded image. This produces a faint image due to the bleaching of the iron(III) ions in the paper. Watercolor paint is now applied to the paper and a hardened film is formed where the gum Arabic contacts the unbleached iron(III) chloride. Washing the paper in water removes the unhardened paint, producing an image with much greater contrast. The process that hardens the gum Arabic has been named “crys-gelling” by practitioners, but the nature of the chemical interaction between the iron(III) ions and the molecules in the gum Arabic has not yet been unraveled. To better understand the interaction between iron(III) ions and gum Arabic, we have prepared paper samples saturated with various <b>iron(III)</b> <b>salts,</b> coated them with a suspension of gum Arabic and measured their absorbance of infrared light. This type of analysis, called infrared spectroscopy, provides us with information of the chemical bonding within the gum Arabic and any changes in that bonding produced by the presence of iron(III) ions. We have made measurements of multiple points on each sample and applied a statistical technique called principal component analysis to highlight differences in the measurements between samples. Finally, we correlate these differences to identify changes in the chemical bonding. We have, to date, studied a group of organic salts (iron(III) ammonium oxalate, iron(III) oxalate and iron(III) ammonium citrate) and a group of inorganic salts (iron(III) chloride, iron(III) bromide, iron(III) sulfate and iron(III) nitrate) and will present the results from our analysis of these samples.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the synthesis and characterization {{of three different}} generations of iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles derivatized with macrocyclic ligands for application as bi-modal imaging agents in the detection of cancer tumors by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). The nanoparticles have been modified with polyethyleneglycol (PEG) {{in order to avoid}} uptake by the Reticuloendothelial System (RES), whilst the macrocyclic ligands have been introduced for chelation of the radionuclide 64 Cu 2 +, which is detectable by PET. Apart from being a platform for the transport of the radionuclide complexes, the magnetic nanoparticles themselves act as MRI contrast agents and can be used for hyperthermia treatment of cancer due to their superparamagnetic nature. Synthesis of the first generation nanoparticles involved coprecipitation of the core nanoparticles from a solution of iron(II) and <b>iron(III)</b> <b>salts</b> through addition of base. The macrocycles 1, 4 -bis(2 -pyridylmethyl) - 1, 4, 7 -triazacyclononane (dmptacn), 1, 4, 7, 10 - tetraazacyclododecane (cyclen) and 1, 4, 8, 11 -tetraazacyclotetradecane (cyclam) were reacted with glycidyloxypropyltriethoxysilane (GPTES) to form the corresponding siloxane derivatives, which were then hydrolyzed over the surface of the nanoparticles to form a stable coating. Macrocycle loadings of the order of 0. 2 mmol/g were achieved using this methodology, and the mean diameter of the nanoparticles was found to be ca. 7 nm, irrespective of the ligand used. Light scattering measurements showed that the particles form aggregates in solution, with a hydrodynamic size of 150 – 200 nm. The nanoparticles could be rapidly radiolabeled with 64 Cu 2 +. Challenge experiments performed with an excess of cyclam indicated that the nanoparticles derivatized with dmptacn were the most resistant to 64 Cu 2 + leaching. These particles were also found to be the most stable in rat plasma. A second generation of nanoparticles was synthesized in order to diminish the aggregation of the nanoparticles. This involved synthesis of the core nanoparticles by coprecipitation, followed by surface coating with oleic acid, which provided enhanced stability (reduced aggregation) in organic media. Displacement of the oleic acid chains with polyethyleneglycol silane (PEG-silane) derivatives was used to produce a stable coating on the nanoparticles and to render them water soluble. Two different PEG-silane molecules, with different PEG chain lengths (Mn 250 and 600), were used to modified the nanoparticles. It was found that the nanoparticles coated with the longer PEG chains (PEG 600) were less susceptible to aggregation in aqueous media. The nanoparticles were also functionalized with different macrocycles through amide coupling to the terminal carboxylic acid groups of the PEG chains. The nanoparticles were found to bind 64 Cu 2 + both specifically (via the macrocycles) and nonspecifically, however the weakly bound ions could be removed by addition of cyclam. In addition to MRI and PET, these second generation nanoparticles would be suitable for use in hyperthermia treatment as they possess a good specific absorption rate. The third generation nanoparticles consisted of iron oxide particles synthesized by thermal decomposition of iron oleate in the presence of oleic acid. Substitution of the surface oleate molecules by ligand exchange reaction with a PEG 600 -silane derivative produced water dispersible nanoparticles with narrower size distribution and smaller hydrodynamic size than the first two generations of nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were found to accumulate in the liver after injection, as revealed by in vivo imaging studies performed on rats. The particles were further functionalized with the 64 Cu 2 + complex of a new dmptacn derivative, via the free carboxyl groups of the PEG chains, to produce an agent suitable for dual modal MRI-PET imaging...|$|E

Specific {{interest is in}} using superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as delivery system of therapeutic genes. Magnetofection has already been described in some proof-of-principle studies; however, fine tuning of the synthesis of SPIONs is necessary for its broader application. Physicochemical properties of SPIONs, synthesized by the co-precipitation in an alkaline aqueous medium, were tested after varying different parameters of the synthesis procedure. The storage time of iron(II) sulfate salt, the type of purified water, and the synthesis temperature did not affect physicochemical properties of SPIONs. Also, varying {{the parameters of the}} synthesis procedure did not influence magnetofection efficacy. However, for the pronounced gene expression encoded by plasmid DNA it was crucial to functionalize poly(acrylic) acid-stabilized SPIONs (SPIONs-PAA) with polyethyleneimine (PEI) without the adjustment of its elementary alkaline pH water solution to the physiological pH. In conclusion, the co-precipitation of iron(II) and <b>iron(III)</b> sulfate <b>salts</b> with subsequent PAA stabilization, PEI functionalization, and plasmid DNA binding is a robust method resulting in a reproducible and efficient magnetofection. To achieve high gene expression is important, however, the pH of PEI water solution for SPIONs-PAA functionalization, which should be in the alkaline range...|$|R

40|$|Electrochemical {{aspects of}} semi-conductors explain many {{features}} of chalcopyrite leaching by <b>iron(III)</b> and copper(II) <b>salts.</b> A surface film {{thought to be}} a metal deficient polysulfide, which is a semi-conductor, forms on chalcopyrite during oxidation. This film is thermally unstable and slows transport of ions, slows electron transfer to oxidants and slows the supply of holes to the solid-solution interface. The Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + couple, indeed most redox couples, are much less reversible on corroding chalcopyrite than on pyrite. On corroding chalcopyrite Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + is much less reversible than are Cu 2 +/Cu+, I 3 −/I− and Fe(CN) 63 −/Fe(CN) 64 − salts. The sulfur film which forms on corroding chalcopyrite does not account for the electrochemical or kinetic aspects of chalcopyrite leaching. Catalysis of FeCl 3 leaching by CuCl 2 in solution, or by Ag 2 S or FeS 2 in the solid CuFeS 2, is explained by the electrochemical model. Ways of enhancing the rates of leaching are suggested...|$|R
