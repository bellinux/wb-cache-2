40|$|International audienceDuring the {{extraction}} of antioxidants from a natural product, volatile compounds are also extracted and consequently the final extract quality is decreased. Therefore, a deodorization step is necessary. The present study introduces thermo-mechanical treatment of rosemary leaves using the instantaneous controlled pressure drop (DIC) method as both deodorization and expansion process. In addition, DIC-deodorization treatment was compared with the hydrodistillation-deodorization (HD). The extraction of essential oils was achieved on dried rosemary leaves within an optimized time of 3 min by <b>DIC</b> <b>and</b> 4 <b>h</b> by HD. Deodorized leaves were recovered and antioxidants were extracted using solvent extraction (ethanol:water 80 : 20). With standard protocol extraction, rosmarinic acid of DIC-treated rosemary leaves (12. 76 mg/g) was {{twice as much as}} untreated leaves (6. 74 mg/g). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light microscopy showed that DIC treatment resulted in profound alterations at cytohistological levels which explain the observed effectiveness of DIC process. The specific surface area calculations showed that DIC treatment allows the material to obtain a higher specific surface area. This explains the behaviour of the product towards {{the extraction}}. Overall, the results clearly revealed that DIC is an efficient method of deodorization that improved solvent extraction of rosemary antioxidants...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{dissolved}} {{inorganic carbon}} (DIC) concentrations associated with ocean acidification can affect marine calcifiers, but local factors, such as high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations through sewage and algal blooms, may interact with this global factor. For calcifying green algae of the genus Halimeda, a key tropical carbonate producer that often occurs in coral reefs, no studies on these interactions have been reported. These data are however urgently needed to understand future carbonate production. Thus, we investigated the independent and combined effects of DIC (pCO 2 402 µatm/ pHtot 8. 0 and 996 µatm/ pHtot 7. 7) and DOC (added as glucose in 0 and 294 µmol/L) on growth, calcification <b>and</b> photosynthesis of <b>H.</b> macroloba <b>and</b> <b>H.</b> opuntia from the Great Barrier Reef in an incubation experiment over 16 days. High DIC concentrations significantly reduced dark calcification of H. opuntia by 130 % and led to net dissolution, but did not affect H. macroloba. High DOC concentrations significantly reduced daily oxygen production of <b>H.</b> opuntia <b>and</b> <b>H.</b> macroloba by 78 % and 43 %, respectively, and significantly reduced dark calcification of H. opuntia by 70 %. Combined high <b>DIC</b> <b>and</b> DOC did not show any interactive effects for both algae, but revealed additive effects for H. opuntia where the combination of both factors reduced dark calcification by 162 % compared to controls. Such species-specific differences in treatment responses indicate H. opuntia is more susceptible {{to a combination of}} high <b>DIC</b> <b>and</b> DOC than <b>H.</b> macroloba. From an ecological perspective, results further suggest a reduction of primary production for Halimeda-dominated benthic reef communities under high DOC concentrations and additional decreases of carbonate accretion under elevated DIC concentrations, where H. opuntia dominates the benthic community. This may reduce biogenic carbonate sedimentation rates and hence the buffering capacity against further ocean acidification...|$|R

In the dry season, <b>DIC</b> <b>and</b> TAlk show a decreasing pattern with salinity, while they have an increasing pattern in the wet season. This complex behavior is mainly a result of mixing between tributaries with distinct <b>and</b> seasonally variable <b>DIC</b> <b>and</b> TAlk values. Distributions of inorganic carbon parameters, in particular pH and pCO(2), are however noticeably modified by local acid-generating biogeochemical processes in the upper estuary. Processes such as nitrification increase acidity during the dry season when freshwater discharge is low and NH 4 +-rich pollutant discharge from the neighboring metropolitan areas is relatively high.

40|$|International audienceHere we use {{observations}} and ocean models to identify mechanisms driving large seasonal to interannual variations in {{dissolved inorganic carbon}} (<b>DIC)</b> <b>and</b> dissolved oxygen (O 2) in the upper ocean. We begin with observations linking variations in upper ocean <b>DIC</b> <b>and</b> O 2 inventories with changes in the physical state of the ocean. Models are subsequently used to address {{the extent to which}} the relationships derived from short‐timescale (6 months to 2 years) repeat measurements are representative of variations over larger spatial and temporal scales. The main new result is that convergence and divergence (column stretching) attributed to baroclinic Rossby waves can make a first‐order contribution to <b>DIC</b> <b>and</b> O 2 variability in the upper ocean. This results in a close correspondence between natural variations in <b>DIC</b> <b>and</b> O 2 column inventory variations and sea surface height (SSH) variations over much of the ocean.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the carbon cycle in Lake Washington {{for the year}} 1980 using monthly measurements of the dissolved inorganic carbon (<b>DIC)</b> <b>and</b> its 13 C: r 2 C isotopic composition. Mass balances of <b>DIC</b> <b>and</b> its 13 C: 12 C yield estimates of CO, gas exchange rates and net organic carbon production rates. Between 24 June and 13 August, the calculated CO, gas invasion rate of 0. 80 x lo 6 mol C d-l is nearly equal to the river DIC inflow rate. The calculated epilimnetic net organic carbon production rate is 0. 68 x lo 6 mol C d-l, about 20 - 30 % of primary productivity estimated from 14 C-fixation experiments and ETS-derived respiration rates.

40|$|On-going ocean {{acidification}} and increasing availability of high-frequency pH data have stimulated interest to understand seasonal pH dynamics in surface waters. Here {{we show that}} it is possible to accurately reproduce observed pH values by combining seasonal changes in temperature (T), dissolved inorganic carbon (<b>DIC),</b> <b>and</b> total alkalinity (TA) from three time series stations with novel pH sensitivity factors. Moreover, we quantify the separate contributions of T, <b>DIC,</b> <b>and</b> TA changes to winter-to-summertime differences in pH, which are in the ranges of − 0. 0334 to − 0. 1237, 0. 0178 to 0. 1169, and − 0. 0063 to 0. 0234, respectively. The effects of <b>DIC</b> <b>and</b> temperature are therefore largely compensatory, and are slightly tempered by changes in TA. Whereas temperature principally drives pH seasonality in low-latitude to midlatitude systems, winter-to-summer DIC changes are most important at high latitudes. This work highlights the potential of pH sensitivity factors as a tool for quantifying the driving mechanisms behind pH changes...|$|R
