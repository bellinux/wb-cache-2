5|$|Richardson {{left the}} art school in 1920, and {{considered}} how else <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>make</b> a career. He briefly thought of pharmacy {{and then of}} journalism, abandoning each when he learned how much study the former required and how difficult mastering shorthand for the latter would be. He was still unsure what to do, when he saw Sir Frank Benson as Hamlet in a touring production. He was thrilled, and felt at once that he must become an actor.|$|E
5|$|By 1962, the American {{government}} was becoming increasingly concerned {{at the lack}} of a commitment from Canada to take nuclear weapons. The interceptors and Bomarc missiles with which Canada was being supplied as a NORAD member were either of no use or of greatly diminished utility without nuclear devices. Canadian and American military officers launched a quiet campaign to make this known to the press, and to advocate for Canadian agreement to acquire the warheads. Diefenbaker was also upset when Pearson was invited to the White House for a dinner for Nobel Prize winners in April, and met with the President privately for 40 minutes. When the Prime Minister met with retiring American Ambassador Livingston Merchant, he angrily disclosed the paper Kennedy had left behind, and hinted that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>make</b> use of it in the upcoming election campaign. Merchant's report caused consternation in Washington, and the ambassador was sent back to see Diefenbaker again. This time, he found Diefenbaker calm, and the Prime Minister pledged not to use the memo, and to give Merchant advance word if he changed his mind. Canada appointed a new ambassador to Washington, Charles Ritchie, who on arrival received a cool reception from Kennedy and found that the squabble was affecting progress on a number of issues.|$|E
25|$|He was {{selected}} in the Prime Ministers XI and {{got back in the}} Australian one day team. He was also selected for the 1984 tour of the West Indies. Ritchie was injured {{towards the end of the}} summer and there was some doubt <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>make</b> the tour but he recovered in time.|$|E

25|$|Bute {{began to}} {{champion}} {{the idea that}} Britain should disentangle itself from the German war, and suggested to Frederick the Great that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>make</b> peace with Austria by giving them back Silesia. Frederick rejected the proposal, although Prussian fortunes were at a low ebb by 1761 following defeats on several fronts. Debates began in London about cancelling all British subsidies to Frederick entirely.|$|E
25|$|Preston's kinsman, Sir Ralph Freeman, who {{had married}} a {{relative}} of George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, now took occasion to represent to Buckingham that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>make</b> friends of the puritans by promoting Preston. Through Buckingham's interest he was made chaplain-in-ordinary to Prince Charles. He took the degree of Bachelor of Divinity in 1620. On Davenant's election (11 June 1621) to the see of Salisbury, Preston had some expectation of succeeding him as Margaret professor of divinity. He felt his Latin to be rusty, and, as an exercise in speaking Latin, he resolved {{on a visit to}} the Dutch universities, a project which he carried out with a singular excess of precaution.|$|E
500|$|Boswell and Johnson {{discussed}} the subject during their 1773 {{tour of the}} Hebrides. Boswell wrote: [...] "After dinner to-day, we talked of the extraordinary fact of Lady Grange’s being sent to St Kilda, and confined there for several years, without any means of relief. Dr Johnson said, if M’Leod would {{let it be known}} that he had such a place for naughty ladies, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>make</b> it a very profitable island." ...|$|E
50|$|The song {{addresses}} {{the fears of}} a father dying while his children are young. Many associate the song with a father about to be deployed overseas afraid that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> not <b>make</b> it back, a subject Worley largely is known for.|$|R

500|$|Rhodes began {{advocating the}} {{annexation}} by Britain of Matabeleland and Mashonaland in 1887 by applying pressure {{to a number}} of senior colonial officials, most prominently the High Commissioner for Southern Africa, Sir Hercules Robinson, and Sidney Shippard, Britain's administrator in the Bechuanaland Crown colony (comprising that country's southern part). Shippard, an old friend of Rhodes, was soon won over to the idea, and in May 1887 the administrator wrote to Robinson strongly endorsing annexation of the territories, particularly Mashonaland, which he described as [...] "beyond comparison the most valuable country south of the Zambezi". It was the Boers, however, who were first to achieve diplomatic successes with Lobengula. Pieter Grobler secured a treaty of [...] "renewal of friendship" [...] between Matabeleland and the South African Republic in July 1887. The same month, Robinson organised the appointment of John Smith Moffat, a locally born missionary, as assistant commissioner in Bechuanaland. Moffat, well-known to Lobengula, was given this position in the hope that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>make</b> the king less cordial with the Boers and more pro-British.|$|E
500|$|Around {{the end of}} 1980, McCain {{decided to}} retire from the Navy. He had not been given a major sea command, and his {{physical}} condition had deteriorated, causing him to fail the flight physical required for any carrier command position (in addition to his limited arm movement, certain weather would always cause him to walk with a limp). [...] McCain thought <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>make</b> rear admiral, but probably not vice admiral, and never become a four-star admiral as his grandfather and father had been. McCain later wrote {{that he did not}} anguish over his decision, although it pained his mother, who thought congressional careers paled in comparison to top naval ones. [...] He was excited by the idea of being a member of Congress and was soon recruiting a campaign manager that Cohen knew, for a planned run at a House seat from Arizona. In early 1981, Secretary of the Navy John F. Lehman, {{who did not want to}} see McCain leave the liaison post, told McCain that he was still on the path to be selected for one-star rear admiral. [...] McCain told Lehman that he was leaving the Navy and that he could [...] "do more good" [...] in Congress.|$|E
500|$|On May 30, Okafor cut {{his list}} of schools to eight: Arizona, Baylor, Duke, Illinois, Kentucky, Kansas, Michigan State and Ohio State, which {{overlapped}} with Jones in six schools. [...] Although Alexander was ranked as the fifth {{best player in the}} class of 2014 by Rivals.com and had offers from four of the six schools common to both by the beginning of June, he said the chances of him matriculating with Jones and Okafor was slim. As the summer evaluation period continued, the unique nature of the possibility of Okafor and Jones, who are not related and not teammates, going to college as a package continued {{to get a lot of}} press. Jones was co-MVP for the 2013 Under Armour Elite 24 All-star game's winning team. On August 13, Jones announced that he would take official visits to four schools Baylor August 30 – September 1; Kentucky September 27–29; Kansas October 18–20; and Duke October 25–27. Notably, Duke, which is the favorite according to Star Tribune writer Amelia Rayno, is scheduled last. [...] On August 14, Jones confirmed that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>make</b> a fifth official visit (the maximum allowed by the NCAA) to Minnesota, although they remained an unlikely underdog. Okafor visited Baylor on August 29 with Jones as the two were ranked 12 in the Rivals.com class of 2014 rankings. One of the reasons Baylor was a serious contender is that Jared Nuness, a member of the Baylor basketball staff, is Jones' cousin.|$|E
60|$|Geoffrey {{admitted}} {{to himself that}} <b>he</b> <b>might</b> again <b>make</b> the attempt to return to England, by taking passage as before in a ship bound for Italy, {{but he knew that}} Elizabeth was negotiating with Philip for peace, and thought that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> as well await the result. He was, indeed, very happy at Cadiz, and shrank from the thought of leaving it.|$|R
2500|$|McCain {{has long}} been a {{supporter}} of the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada. In 2008, however, {{on the eve of a}} campaign appearance in Nevada, he called for the establishment of [...] "an international repository for spent nuclear fuel", which, <b>he</b> said, <b>might</b> <b>make</b> it unnecessary to open Yucca Mountain.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps he pitied himself also. If so, {{it is to}} be {{hoped that}} Florence may never know of such pity.

2500|$|Morales {{began work}} on his [...] "indigenous autonomy" [...] policy, which he {{launched}} in the eastern lowlands department on August 3, 2009. Bolivia was the first nation {{in the history of}} South America to affirm the right of indigenous people to self-government. Speaking in Santa Cruz Department, the President called it [...] "a historic day for the peasant and indigenous movement", saying that, though <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>make</b> errors, he would [...] "never betray the fight started by our ancestors and the fight of the Bolivian people." [...] A vote on further autonomy for jurisdictions took place in December 2009, {{at the same time as}} general elections to office. The issue divided the country.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Harding promised. He did {{not exactly}} know {{what there was}} to be explained, or why Dr. Grantly's mind should not be disabused of the mistake into which he had fallen, but {{nevertheless}} he promised.

2500|$|In a {{parallel}} plot line, Oberon, {{king of the}} fairies, and Titania, his queen, {{have come to the}} forest outside Athens. Titania tells Oberon that she plans to stay there until she has attended Theseus and Hippolyta's wedding. Oberon and Titania are estranged because Titania refuses to give her Indian changeling to Oberon for use as his [...] "knight" [...] or [...] "henchman," [...] since the child's mother was one of Titania's worshippers. Oberon seeks to punish Titania's disobedience. He calls upon Robin [...] "Puck" [...] Goodfellow, his [...] "shrewd and knavish sprite," [...] to help him concoct a magical juice derived from a flower called [...] "love-in-idleness," [...] which turns from white to purple when struck by Cupid's arrow. When the concoction is applied to the eyelids of a sleeping person, that person, upon waking, falls in love with the first living thing he perceives. He instructs Puck to retrieve the flower with the hope that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>make</b> Titania fall in love with an animal of the forest and thereby shame her into giving up the little Indian boy. He says, [...] "And ere I take this charm from off her sight,/As I can take it with another herb,/I'll make her render up her page to me." ...|$|E
