5|$|Glamorgan {{sausages}} {{are thought}} to have been originally made with Glamorgan cheese which is no longer made due to the near-extinction of the Glamorgan cattle from which it was produced.

5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as Dr. William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University. A normal season as defined by NOAA has six to fourteen named storms of which four to eight reach hurricane strength and one to three become major hurricanes. The June 1988 forecast was that eleven storms would form and that seven would reach hurricane status. The forecast <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>specify</b> how many hurricanes would reach major hurricane status.|$|E

5|$|The {{constitution}} <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>specify</b> {{whether a}} plurality or {{a majority vote}} was required to elect the governor, but the electors, following a common practice of other states, decided to hold a second vote between Logan and Garrard {{in order to achieve}} a majority. Most of Todd's electors supported Garrard on the second vote, giving him a majority. In a letter dated May 17, 1796, Kentucky Secretary of State James Brown certified Garrard's election, and Governor Shelby sent him a letter of congratulations on his election on May 27.|$|E

While the design <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>specify</b> the exact form that this would take, in the completed memorial these names are inscribed in the bronzes that line the walls. The design also allowed for a cenotaph within the inner shrine, which the designers suggested could either be used as a symbolic representation of the unknown soldier or as the marker to an actual grave, although this aspect was never realised.|$|E
5|$|Despite the opposition, on 30 June 1852 the London Necropolis & National Mausoleum Act 1852 was passed, {{giving the}} Brookwood scheme Parliamentary consent to proceed.

To prevent the LSWR from {{exploiting}} its monopoly on access to the cemetery, the private Act of Parliament authorising the scheme bound the LSWR to carry corpses and mourners to the cemetery in perpetuity and set a maximum tariff which could be levied on funeral traffic, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>specify</b> details of how the funeral trains were to operate.|$|E

5|$|Dvořák often adapted Bohemian {{folklore}} for his compositions, and {{his previous}} four symphonic poems {{were based on}} actual poems by the Czech poet Karel Jaromír Erben, especially Erben's collection of ballads Kytice. A Hero's Song broke away from this pattern of programmatic symphonic works, as Dvořák <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>specify</b> a specific accompanying text, and he only roughly outlined its plot in a later letter. The lack of a fixed programme has been hypothesized {{as a reason for}} its relative neglect when compared to Dvořák's other symphonic works. It has also been suggested that the work was intended to be autobiographical, an unusual approach for Dvořák. This was Dvořák's only symphonic poem that pursued Franz Liszt's idealized view of the genre, as Dvořák's other four works were based on eerie subjects not appropriate to Liszt's conception.|$|E
5|$|Following {{complaints}} from local media over {{limited access to}} Goldschmidt's public papers stored at the Oregon Historical Society (OHS), the state archivist announced May 29 that Goldschmidt would seize the 256 boxes of documents to guarantee public access as defined in a state law passed in 1973. That law required that public access to such records be maintained, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>specify</b> where the records be kept. Following Goldschmidt's decision to put the documents {{in the care of}} the OHS, the state legislature passed a law requiring future governors to leave their documents in the state archives. Many records were published on the state archives' Web site in early 2005.|$|E

A normal season, {{as defined by the}} National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), has six to fourteen named storms, with four to eight of those reaching hurricane strength, and one to three major hurricanes. The July 23, 1983 forecast predicted that after the slow start to the season, that a total of eight storms would form, and five of the storms would reach hurricane status. The forecast <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>specify</b> how many of the hurricanes would reach major hurricane status. However, the predictions proved to be too high, with only four named storms forming {{by the end of the}} season and three of those reaching hurricane status.|$|E

5|$|On 30 June 1852 the {{promoters}} of the Brookwood scheme were given Parliamentary consent to proceed, and the London Necropolis and National Mausoleum Company (LNC) was formed.

To prevent the LSWR from exploiting its monopoly on access to the cemetery, the private Act of Parliament authorising the scheme bound the LSWR to carry corpses and mourners to the cemetery in perpetuity and set a maximum tariff which could be levied on funeral traffic, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>specify</b> detail of how the funeral trains were to operate.|$|E

His family and friends, however, held a funeral for him at the Santa Cruz funeral home in Altozano, Morelia. They did not comment where the corpse was to be taken, but unconfirmed reports suggested that there were plans to cremate him and scatter his ashes at a village in the Tierra Caliente region in Michoacán.|$|E
5|$|According to cricket {{historian}} Bernard Whimpress, {{the early}} signs of a conspiracy against Marsh were raised by a journalist from The Age of Melbourne {{by the name of}} Old Boy. The journalist set a possible agenda by raising a question about Marsh to Crockett on the day before the bowler was called, possibly predisposing the umpire to take action. If Old Boy could be relied on, then observers suspected that Marsh's faster and slower ball were dubious. The reporter <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>specify</b> which ball he questioned, except to say that one ball per over was doubtful. The events in Australia occurred against a backdrop of a throwing frenzy in England. A fortnight earlier, the captains of the English county teams had drawn up a list of prohibited bowlers. In Australia, Jim Phillips had set the tone by no-balling Australian Test bowler Ernie Jones. The events in England were seen as a catalyst for a clean-up campaign against dubious bowling actions. Historians regarded Marsh as a prime target due to his Indigenous heritage and his supple wrist action.|$|E
