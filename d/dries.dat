5|$|Even though Lana {{eventually}} marries Lex {{in season}} six, Al Gough argues that Lana still loved Clark and Clark still loved her. The only reason Lana was with Lex was because Clark forced {{her in that}} direction and she ended up getting in over her head. By contrast, writer Caroline <b>Dries</b> feels that Lana did love Lex, and {{that she did not}} make any hasty decisions when she agreed to marry him. <b>Dries</b> believes that the progression of the show demonstrates that Lex earned Lana's love. To answer viewers that hated to see Lana marry Lex, <b>Dries</b> contends that as viewers we are seeing all of Lex, including how evil he truly is, while Lana only sees the portion of Lex that appears good.|$|E

40|$|Background: The current typical <b>drying</b> {{methods for}} red ginseng are sun <b>drying</b> and hot-air <b>drying.</b> The {{purpose of this}} study was to {{investigate}} <b>drying</b> characteristics of red ginseng by using far-infrared <b>drying.</b> Methods: The far-infrared <b>drying</b> tests on red ginseng were conducted at two <b>drying</b> stages: (1) high temperature for 24  h <b>drying</b> and (2) low temperature <b>drying</b> until the final moisture content was 13  ±  0. 5 % (wet basis). The high temperature <b>drying</b> stage included three <b>drying</b> chamber temperature conditions of 60 °C, 65 °C, and 70 °C. The low temperature <b>drying</b> stage was conducted at temperatures of 45 °C and 50 °C. <b>Drying</b> characteristics were analyzed based on factors such as <b>drying</b> rate, color changes, energy consumption, and saponin content. The results were compared with those of the hot-air and sun <b>drying</b> methods. Results: The results revealed that increases in <b>drying</b> temperature caused a decrease in <b>drying</b> time and energy consumption for far-infrared <b>drying.</b> The saponin content decreased under all <b>drying</b> conditions after <b>drying,</b> the highest value (11. 34  mg/g) was observed at <b>drying</b> conditions of 60 ∼ 50 °C. The sun <b>drying</b> condition showed the lowest color difference value when compared with far-infrared and hot-air <b>drying.</b> Conclusion: The far-infrared <b>drying</b> showed a faster <b>drying</b> rate, higher saponin content, lower color difference value, and a decrease in energy consumption than seen in hot-air <b>drying...</b>|$|R

5|$|Although, {{the use of}} oil as {{a binding}} agent {{can be traced to}} the 12th century, {{innovations}} in its handling and manipulation define the era. Egg tempera was the dominant medium until the 1430s, and while it produces both bright and light colours, it <b>dries</b> quickly and is a difficult medium in which to achieve naturalistic textures or deep shadows. Oil allows smooth, translucent surfaces and can be applied in a range of thicknesses, from fine lines to thick broad strokes. It <b>dries</b> slowly and is easily manipulated while still wet. These characteristics allowed more time to add subtle detail and enable wet-on-wet techniques. Smooth transitions of colour are possible because portions of the intermediary layers of paint can be wiped or removed as the paint <b>dries.</b> Oil enables differentiation among degrees of reflective light, from shadow to bright beams, and minute depictions of light effects through the use of transparent glazes. This new freedom in controlling light effects gave rise to more precise and realistic depictions of surface textures; van Eyck and van der Weyden typically show light falling on surfaces such as jewellery, wooden floors, textiles and household objects.|$|E

Elephants have difficulty releasing heat through the skin because of their low surface-area-to-volume ratio, which is many times smaller than that of a human.
