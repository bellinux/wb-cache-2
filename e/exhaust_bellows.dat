40|$|An {{analytical}} model {{has recently been}} developed for predicting the circuit oxygen levels in semi-closed underwater breathing apparatus at various mission depths and diver activity levels (Nuckols, Clarke, Marr, 1999). Unmanned testing in June 2000 with a commercially available US Divers Aqualung OxyMix rebreather (NEDU Test Plan Number 00 - 06 dated May 2000) showed good agreement with this {{analytical model}} {{over a wide range}} of diver depths, orientations and activity levels (Nuckols, Gavin, Finlayson, 2000). However, the model indicated that an enhanced performance capability could possibly be achieved with the OxyMix by modifying the size of its <b>exhaust</b> <b>bellows</b> and changing the oxygen content of the supply gas. Following the tests in June, an optimization approach was applied to the analytical model to define desired design parameters for the OxyMix rebreather to maximize its excursion depth capability. Optimized exhaust volume ratios (EVR), the ratio of the small inner bellows volume relative to the main breathing bellows, and supply gas oxygen concentrations were identified to maximize safe operations for the OxyMix design. US Divers agreed to fabricate two modified <b>exhaust</b> <b>bellows</b> of varying volumes for testing to verify the predicted performances of th...|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to gather {{experimental}} data of a stainless steel sleeve being formed into a convoluted tube. This convoluted tube, made from stainless steel ASTM 240 type 321 and with a wall thickness of 0, 4 mm, is {{the main part of}} an automotive <b>exhaust</b> <b>bellow.</b> The automotive <b>exhaust</b> <b>bellow</b> fits into a motor vehicle exhaust system. One of the functions of this bellow is to compensate for engine movement. The bellow is also used to damp the engine vibration to the vehicle chassis. Typical failures that occur during the production of a convoluted tube are identified. The data gathered are listed and the forming process, typical conditions and its effects discussed. The actual data and graphs are presented in the annexures {{at the end of this}} report. Plasticity theory for shells and cylinders is summarized in Annexure A and the solution of a related problem discussed. Experimental data were used to verify the result of a finite element model. The calculated values of the model compare well with the values of the experimental data. The model must still be developed further and the experimental data can be used to verify this developed model. Possible aspects, related to the forming and life-cycle prediction of an automotive <b>exhaust</b> <b>bellow,</b> that still need to be studied are identified and presented at the end of this report...|$|R

However, making two American expeditions in rapid succession <b>exhausted</b> <b>Bellew,</b> and he died in his fifty-first year, on 19 June 1874, at 16 Circus Road, St John's Wood, London.

50|$|The Swedish {{lieutenant}} Carl Johan Ljunggren retold {{the retreat}} from Oravais like this:"The darkness {{was such that}} despite continuous shovings one could not recognize the shover... Hundreds of noises {{came out of the}} night; everywhere the wounded wailed, each in his own language; artillerymen and coachmen yelled at their <b>exhausted</b> horses and <b>bellowed</b> scores of curses each time they became stuck, which happened all the time; wheels and weapons rattled, soldiers bellowed; all staggered from tiredness and hunger. Thus came the army finally to Nykarleby. The Russians hadn't followed, for their forces were also completely spent.|$|R
