5|$|In {{the absence}} of the resting Bradman, Hassett won the toss and elected to bat. Attendance was 17,000 {{on the first day of}} this two-day non-first-class match. Rain {{prevented}} any play on the second <b>day.</b> <b>After</b> <b>a</b> poor start that saw them fall to 22/3, McCool (64) and Miller (55) made half-centuries for the Australians. Many of the Australians made starts and six scores passed 20, but none went on. Paceman Keith Jackson took 5/76 for the hosts.

Bradman chose to use the light roller and play was supposed to begin as soon as the lunch break ended.|$|E
5|$|Lavigne {{began dating}} fellow Canadian rocker Chad Kroeger, {{frontman}} {{of the band}} Nickelback, in July 2012.

Lavigne and Kroeger became engaged in August 2012, after one month of dating. The couple married at the Château de La Napoule, a reconstructed medieval castle on the Mediterranean in the South of France, on 1 July 2013 (which is Canada <b>Day),</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> year of being together.

5|$|On 15 January 2013 former fcbusiness {{magazine}} editor Ryan McKnight was named {{as the new}} Chief Executive Officer at the club, becoming the youngest CEO in UK football. Fourteen months into his second spell at Edgeley Park and with County in the relegation zone, Gannon was fired as Stockport County boss following the 3–1 home defeat by Mansfield Town on 16 January 2013. He was replaced by Darije Kalezić, who initially saw an upturn in results, but left the position himself two months later following a poor run that left the club in serious danger of relegation to the Conference North. Ian Bogie in turn succeeded Kalezić, {{but was unable to}} turn the club's form around, and they were relegated to the Conference North on the final <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> defeat to title challengers Kidderminster Harriers.|$|E

5|$|Tropical storm {{warnings}} {{were issued}} for the Florida Keys, the Florida Bay, {{and from the}} Jupiter Inlet coast southward to Cape Sable on September28. A tropical storm watch was {{in place for the}} mainland north from the Jupiter Inlet to the Sebastian Inlet and north of East Cape Sable to Chokoloskee. The warnings and watch were discontinued the next <b>day,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> direct impact was no longer expected. At the time, a flood watch remained in effect for Palm Beach, Broward, Miami-Dade, Collier, and Monroe counties into September30. An airport weather warning was issued for Orlando International Airport and Executive Airport on September 28; arriving flights were put on hold, and pilots rerouted to other airports if possible. Eight Southwest Airlines flights were diverted to the airports of Tampa and Jacksonville, and one JetBlue flight to West Palm Beach. Though airport officials later reported normalized conditions, an additional 26 flights were canceled at Miami International Airport the next day.|$|E
5|$|Unbeknownst to Rollins, Cadena {{wanted to}} switch to guitar, and the band {{was looking for a}} new vocalist. The band was {{impressed}} with Rollins' singing and stage demeanor, and the next <b>day,</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> semi-formal audition at Tu Casa Studio in New York City, they asked him to become their permanent vocalist. Despite some doubts, he accepted, in part because of MacKaye's encouragement. His high level of energy and intense personality suited the band's style, but Rollins' diverse tastes in music were a key factor in his being selected as singer; Black Flag's founder Greg Ginn was growing restless creatively and wanted a singer who was willing to move beyond simple, three-chord punk.|$|E
5|$|While an undergraduate, she {{did some}} {{practice}} {{teaching at the}} Chinese high school in town shortly before graduating in 1952.

5|$|First {{reported}} in 2003, {{the idea of}} using a form of the Atkins diet to treat epilepsy came about after parents and patients discovered that the induction phase of the Atkins diet controlled seizures. The ketogenic diet team at Johns Hopkins Hospital modified the Atkins diet by removing the aim of achieving weight loss, extending the induction phase indefinitely, and specifically encouraging fat consumption. Compared with the ketogenic diet, the modified Atkins diet (MAD) places no limit on calories or protein, and the lower overall ketogenic ratio (approximately 1:1) {{does not need to be}} consistently maintained by all meals of the day. The MAD does not begin with a fast or with a stay in hospital and requires less dietitian support than the ketogenic diet. Carbohydrates are initially limited to 10g per day in children or 20g per day in adults, and are increased to 20–30g per <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>a</b> month or so, depending on the effect on seizure control or tolerance of the restrictions. Like the ketogenic diet, the MAD requires vitamin and mineral supplements and children are carefully and periodically monitored at outpatient clinics.|$|E
5|$|Intense Tropical Cyclone Hondo (JTWC designation: 16S) was {{the strongest}} and longest lived {{tropical}} cyclone to develop during the 2007–08 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. The third tropical cyclone and first intense tropical cyclone of the season, Hondo developed out of a tropical disturbance in early February about 1,020km (635mi) east-southeast of Diego Garcia. The disturbance quickly strengthened, becoming a moderate tropical storm on February4 and a severe tropical storm the following <b>day.</b> <b>After</b> <b>a</b> brief period of slower intensification, Hondo rapidly intensified into an intense tropical cyclone and reached its peak intensity with winds of 215km/h (130mph 10-minute winds) on February7. The cyclone gradually weakened {{over the next several}} days due to an increase in forward speed and a decrease in sea surface temperatures. On February12, Hondo rapidly degenerated into a remnant-low pressure area. Over the following week, the remnant low traveled in a general west-northwest direction with no development. On February20, about 2,780km (1,725mi) northeast of where the final advisories were issued, the storm began to regenerate. The next day, advisories were issued on Tropical Disturbance Ex-Hondo, which briefly strengthened into a tropical depression. However, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, Hondo continued to strengthen and attained winds of 95km/h (60mph 1-minute winds) before passing directly over Réunion. Interaction with the island caused the storm to weaken and degenerate into a remnant low once more. The storm dissipated on February29 after executing a counterclockwise loop.|$|E
