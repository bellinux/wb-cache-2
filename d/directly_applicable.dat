Consequently, the theorem is <b>directly</b> <b>applicable</b> to time-dependent signals and is normally formulated in that context. However, the sampling theorem can be extended in a straightforward way to functions of arbitrarily many variables. Grayscale images, for example, are often represented as two-dimensional arrays (or matrices) of real numbers representing the relative intensities of pixels (picture elements) located at the intersections of row and column sample locations. As a result, images require two independent variables, or indices, to specify each pixel uniquely—one for the row, {{and one for the}} column.|$|E

In this paper we propose a constrained-based watermarking technique and lay out a theoretical framework to evaluate watermarking techniques for intellectual property protection (IPP).

Since credibility and overhead are the most important criteria for any efficient watermarking technique, we derive formulae that illustrate the trade-off between credibility and overhead...|$|R

As a consequence, the developed theory opens an unexplored way to control transport properties of 2 DEG by a strong high-frequency electromagnetic field. From experimental viewpoint, this theory is <b>applicable</b> <b>directly</b> to quantum wells exposed to a laser-generated electromagnetic wave. Comment: Published versio...|$|R

40|$|Colour based {{indicator}} for smart packaging {{is important}} for customers to get real fresh product and minimize the risk dealing with expiry storage. Currently, there is no exact model to relate these gradual colour changes with what extend of quality rate. Thus in this paper, it proposed a model based on association rules mining to generate relationship of smart packaging colour indicator {{and the quality of}} pasteurized milk packaged on the plastic bottle. The objectives of this research were to identify association parameters and to develop an association model of discoloration of smart packaging indicator on natural dyes to the quality changes. For a complete solution, the association model was effective to predict the status of smart packaging by applying the apriory algorithm from a combination of items. This research showed applicability from the association parameters which were obtained from previous research. Furthermore, this research generated top 10 rules out of 77 significant association rules which effectively outlined the quality to discoloration relationship and had strong relationship. Hence, these rules <b>directly</b> were <b>applicable</b> for the implementation of natural dyes to construct a smart packaging indicator...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{advent of}} {{standardized}} classification {{and assessment of}} psychiatric disorders, and considerable joint efforts among many countries {{has led to the}} reporting of international rates of psychiatric disorders, and inevitably, their comparison between different racial groups. Results In neurologic diseases with defined genetic etiologies, the same genetic cause has different phenotypes in different racial groups. Conclusion We suggest that genetic differences between races mean that diagnostic criteria refined in one racial group, may not be <b>directly</b> and simply <b>applicable</b> to other racial groups and thus more effort needs to be expended on defining diseases in other groups. Cross-racial confounds (in addition to cultural confounds) make the interpretation of rates in different groups even more hazardous than seems to have been appreciated. </p...|$|R
2500|$|On {{appeal to}} the SCA, Cameron JA held—and Mpati DP, Mlambo JA, Combrinck JA and Cachalia JA concurred—that, since the LRA {{expressly}} excluded members of the SANDF from its operation, there was no <b>directly</b> <b>applicable</b> statute to the present set of circumstances. Section 23(1) of the Constitution, which guaranteed everyone [...] "the right to fair labour practices," [...] did, however, cover members of the defence force. Consistent with that right, Cameron broadened the common law of employment so as to impose a duty of fair dealing with their employees on all employers, including those {{not covered by the}} LRA.
