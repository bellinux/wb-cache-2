40|$|Climate change affects all Earth surface systems {{but with}} the arguably {{greatest}} impact in high-latitude and high-altitude cold environments. In these areas, c 1 <b>imate</b> <b>change</b> shapes earth surface proeesses not just by altering vegetation cover and human activities but also through its impact on frost penetration and duration within the ground surface layers. All of these factors influence pattems of erosion, transport and deposition of sediments and related fluxes (e. g., nutrients, solutes, carbon). Tt {{is a challenge to}} develop {{a better understanding of how}} these faetors combine to affect sedimentary transfer proeesses and sediment budgets in eold environments. Our baseline knowledge on the weathering, erosion, sedimentary transfer and depositional proeesses operating within Holocene to eontemporary c 1 imates forms our basis for predieting the consequences of predicted future c 1 <b>imate</b> <b>change</b> and related vegetation cover changes. However, much of this information is!imited in terms of spatial and temporal coverage and needs to be extended and consolidated. Only when we have these reliable models response to landscape and c 1 <b>imate</b> <b>change</b> we will have fuller understanding of probable future changes to these regions.

40|$|The {{climate change}} due to fossil fuel based energy generation, the highly {{volatile}} fossil fuel {{prices and the}} resulting economic challenges have confronted us with the world we have created.

40|$|As Madagascar, l ike al l other {{countries}} on the globe, is {{gearing up for the}} meeting of the 21 st Conference of Parties (COP 21) of UN’s Framework Cl <b>imate</b> <b>Change</b> Convention (UNFCCC), we reflect on the persistent fai lure of development pol icies in Madagascar, and suggest that there may be fundamental flaws in perceptions about development interventions and transferabi l i ty of solutions, resulting in a country in permanent crisis despite the island’s great potential. The major official donors claim that they had left the island to itself since the 2009 crisis. However, World Bank sta-tistics show that, in current terms, Madagascar was receiving US$ 400 mi l l ion in 1 990 and US $ 500 mi l l ion in 201 3. In the same interval, the Gross National Product (GDP) per capita remained ba-sical ly the same (equivalent to 440 US$/capita in 201 3). Should COP 21 produce a momentum for massive investment in carbon emission reduction and in adaptation to cl <b>imate</b> <b>change</b> (CC), we propose that, at a minimum, these new projects, plans, programs and pol icies should aim for sustainabi l i ty by applying Environmen-tal and Social Assessments at al l required levels and that, prefera-bly, this should be the opportunity to approach development differently. In particular, we advocate focusing on enhancing the generative capacity (i. e., the capacity to generate unplanned-for new development options) of Malagasy people to better take ad-vantage of the natural resources and the information and com-munications technologies (ICT) infrastructure already in place. Such an ambitious program is not without risks and pitfal ls, but it is one way of thinking about breaking out of Madagascar’s current self-reinforcing cycle of under-performance. The purpose of this essay is to question the status quo to stimulate discussion and new thinking, short of which observers, 20 years from now, wi l l find themselves echoing the same frustrations that observers and inhabitants al ike experience when faced with the present state of development in Madagascar.

40|$|In the Portland, Oregon, {{metropolitan}} area, suburban {{cities such}} as Hillsboro are projected to grow as people seek affordable housing near a rapidly growing metropolis. This thesis examines the combined impact of 2 ̆ 7 c 1 <b>imate</b> <b>change</b> and urban development on both neighborhood and municipal scale residential water demand in Hillsboro, Oregon. I use two models, a surface energy balance model, Local-scale Urban Meteorological Parameterization Scheme (LUMPS), and a system dynamics model, CCDomestic, to investigate changes in residential water demand in the 2040 s at two distinct spatial scales, the neighborhood and the municipality. I calibrate and validate each model to the reference period and then simulate the future (2030 - 2059) under three statistically downscaled global climate models and two urban development scenarios. The {{findings of this study}} indicate that climate change and urban development will not evenly affect water consumption in neighborhoods across a city. Instead, the current land cover and residential density of a neighborhood exert an important influence on the response. Heavily vegetated neighborhoods exhibit large increases in water demand under urban sprawl and warming scenarios, while neighborhoods dominated by impervious surfaces decrease water consumption under sprawl scenarios and show little change in water consumption under combined sprawl and warming scenarios. At the municipal scale findings suggest that water demand is highly sensitive to urban design and management and that the combination of urban densification and water conservation regulations could mitigate increases in water consumption from population growth and climate change...|$|E
40|$|In {{a recent}} paper, Lamb and Davis (2003) {{proposed}} that c 1 <b>imate</b> <b>change</b> was indirectly {{responsible for the}} uplift of the Andes. They suggested that an increase in aridity during the Cenozoic associated with global c 1 imate cooling resulted in decreased erosion and reduction in sediment supply to the trench. This lack of sediment resulted in increased friction and enhanced shear stress along the plate interface and uplift and deformation of the South American Plate. However, this hypothesis is not supported by evidence for climate change from the Cenozoic sedimentary record in western South America, by studies of the plate interface itself and the deformation history of the Central Andes. It is proposed that uplift of the Andes is unrelated to sediment starvation at the trench, and rather results from a cornbination of limited erosion associated with a long-term arid c 1 imatic regime {{and changes in the}} direction and rate of relative plate convergence. Climate Change A substantial body of information is available (not reviewed here) on the late Mesozoic and Cenozoic geomorphological, sedimentological and tectonic history of the north Chilean forearc that allows constraints to be placed on the c 1 imatic history of the area. An early Cretaceous to late Eocene voJcanic arc was located in the present day Central Depression. A 6000 rn thick back-arc basin-fill was deposited east of the arc in the present day Precordillera. Sediments were deposited in alluvial fan, ephemeral fluvial, aeolian, ephemeral lacustrine...|$|E
40|$|The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) {{developed}} {{a new series of}} emission scenarios (SRES). Six global models were used to develop SRES but most focused primarily on energy and industry related emissions. Land-use emissions were only covered by three models, where IMAGE included the most detailed, spatially explicit description of global land-use and land-cover dynamics. To complement their calculations the other models used land-use emission from AIM and IMAGE, leading to inconsistent estimates. Representation of the land-use emissions in SRES is therefore poor. This paper presents details on the IMAGE 2. 1 land-use results to complement the SRES report. The IMAGE SRES scenarios are based on the original IPCC SRES assumptions and narratives using the latest version of IMAGE (IMAGE 2. 2). IMAGE provides comprehensive emission estimates because not only emissions are addressed but also the resulting atmospheric concentrations, c 1 <b>imate</b> <b>change</b> and impacts. Additionally, in SRES the scenario assumptions were only presented and quantified for 4 "macro-regions". The IMAGE 2. 2 SRES implementation has been extended towards 17 regions. We focus on land-use aspects and show that land-related emissions not only depend on population projections but also on the temporal and spatial dynamics of different land-related sources and sinks of greenhouse gases. We also illustrate the importance of systemic feed backs and interactions in the c 1 imate system that influence land-use emissions, such as deforestation and forest regrowth, soil respiration and CO 2 -fertilisation...|$|E

40|$|Throughout the year, a {{wide range}} of {{transient}} weather systems act on South America. Among them we can mention the atmospheric blocking phenomena occurring especially in middle latitudes with duration ranging from a few days, staying active for weeks. During the occurrence of an atmospheric blocking, there is a persistent high pressure anomaly, located south of the belt of semi permanent subtropical highs. This situation prevents the systems from moving in a normal course, featuring a c 1 assic situation of blocking. To detect these events we used the index proposed by Pelly and Hoskins (2003 - PH 03). This index detected the reversal of the meridional gradient of potential temperature on the dynamic tropopause (high levels) caused by persistent anomalous circulation. The situation must remain active for more than three consecutive days and be present in an area greater than 10 o longitude. The events will be evaluated on HadGEM 2 -ES data {{which is part of the}} CMIP 5, within the c 1 <b>imate</b> <b>change</b> scenario RCP 4. 5. To verify the functionality of the index PH 03, an atmospheric blocking event which occurred in the Pacific southeast was selected. This region of the globe concentrates most of the activities that remotely influence the temperature and precipitation regimes in South America. Besides this, there are two other preferential regions of occurrence in HS, concentrating near southwestem Australia and in the southwestem portion of the Atlantic, van Loon (1956). In the context of this work, the remo te effects of blocking will be analyzed later, however, at this stage the concem focuses in verifying the functionality of the index PH 03. Thus, the index is calculated for the 1986 winter period; moreover, we will analyze the meteorological fields that characterize its synoptic conditions. The blocking remained active in the region for several days between the end of July and the first half of August. The preliminary results were satisfactory; in such a way that the analysis of meteorological fields showed the establishment of the blocking condition. The analysis of other cases can be done to confirm the functionality of the PH 03 index in hístorical database to prepare a blocking climatology,update and evaluate the remote influences in a future c 1 imate scenario.
