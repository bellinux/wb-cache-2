25|$|The East Romans {{began to}} <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> from Uldin's Huns again in 408. Uldin crossed the Danube and {{captured}} a fortress in Moesia named Castra Martis, which was betrayed from within. Uldin {{then proceeded to}} ransack Thrace. The East Romans tried to buy Uldin off, but his sum was too high so they instead bought off Uldin's subordinates. This resulted in many desertions from Uldin's group of Huns.|$|E
25|$|With {{the other}} {{planters}} Milan was equally whimsical. For trifling misdemeanors, he instituted elaborate investigations and meted out extravagant fines and punishments where a wiser {{man would have}} overlooked the whole matter. Offending negroes were made to <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> of the governor's heavy hand. A runaway {{who might have been}} mercifully beheaded was impaled alive on a sharpened stick to die in horrible agony. Another negro, arrested on a similar charge, had his foot cut off, after which he was confiscated to the governor's use and put to work in his kitchen.|$|E
25|$|Corse {{drove off}} the Confederate {{skirmish}} line and seized some half-built defensive {{works at the}} north end of Tunnel Hill. Continuing over the crest of the hill, Corse charged Cleburne's main position but was repulsed. After several attempts, Sherman gave up on attacking from Corse's position and the fighting shifted to the west side of the ridge. Loomis had advanced to the railroad in front of the ridge where he skirmished with Walker's division. Buschbeck, followed by Matthies and then Raum were sent up the west slope of Tunnel Hill between Loomis and Corse. Cleburne's salient began to <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> and it came close to breaking. Hardee fed in reinforcements from Stevenson's division, and Cleburne ordered a general counterattack. Charging down the hill at 4 p.m., the Confederates routed Sherman's men, who were too tired and low on ammunition to resist, and captured numerous Federal prisoners.|$|E

500|$|René Angélil, Dion, and the Sony family began {{selecting}} prospective songs at {{the beginning}} of 2001, and on 28 August 2001 she started recording vocal tracks for nearly two dozen songs at Montreal's Piccolo Studios. Because of Dion's unwillingness to leave her seven-month-old baby, the album's collaborators traveled to Montreal. [...] "I didn't <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> to try and outdo anything," [...] Dion said of her time in the studio. [...] "I proved myself before, so now I can enjoy. I was relaxed, I just let go. It was such a pleasure." [...] The album was scheduled for release internationally on 25 March 2002 and in North America on 26 March 2002. However, it was first released in Australia, on 22 March 2002.|$|E
500|$|Hancock {{began to}} <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> of {{directing}} his first epic adventure film [...] "with only three film credits, and all small-scale dramas". The producers were unhappy with his material, {{and on a}} Saturday evening in June 1977, after {{a meeting with the}} producers and Universal executives, the director was fired. He and his wife left for Rome and production was shut down for a few weeks. The couple had been involved in the film for eighteen months. Hancock blamed his departure on the mechanical shark, telling a newspaper that it still couldn't swim or bite after a year and a half; [...] "You get a couple of shots and [...] breaks." [...] Echoing the first film's production, Carl Gottlieb was enlisted to further revise the script, adding humor and reducing some of the violence. Gottlieb wrote on location at Fort Walton Beach, Florida. It cost the producers more money to hire Gottlieb to do the rewrite than it would have if they had hired him in the first place.|$|E
500|$|New York magazine's Amy Odell {{commented that}} [...] "The {{intricacy}} of her [...] wardrobe [...] suggests she's feeling the Gaga pressure." [...] She further added: [...] "In a burgeoning phenomenon {{we might call}} the Gaga Effect, divas everywhere may <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> to push avant-garde fashion to the max {{to keep up with}} the pantsless wonder. Beyoncé's fashion efforts in 'Video Phone'— which make her epic diva money fan a mere distant memory— deserve a look-by-look analysis, because she tried really hard." [...] In another review, she said [...] "Together they play with colored fire-spitting water guns and look like the best of diva friends." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Leah Greenblatt commented that the video was [...] "B's show—La Gaga's just guesting in it." [...] Greenblatt also praised the fashion designs used in the video and the Bettie Page [...] "vibes". Spins Chris Zakorchemny felt that Gaga [...] "does her best Beyonce impression" [...] in the video for the song. However, he said that [...] "Even with Gaga involved, the Hype Williams-produced video doesn't veer too much into the weird; it's certainly not Gaga-setting-men-on-fire weird." [...] Margaret Wappler of The Arizona Republic praised the video saying that it had [...] "electrifying color schemes and high-shine lighting, resulting in a fantastical pop mirage between Lady Gaga and Beyonce". She further called it a [...] "kinetic spectacle to behold, with enough guns to make Ted Nugent weep with jealousy and some hot Bettie Page bangs on Beyonce that should prompt plenty of ladies to run to the hairdresser". Wappler finished her review by concluding that [...] "the whole video has a distinct and not unpleasant 90s vibe." [...] Francesca Stabile of The Village Voice gave a positive review for the video praising the outfits used in the video and the [...] "oversized sequined sweater that makes an appearance toward the end".|$|E

2500|$|As {{opposed to}} all other sumo ranks yokozuna cannot be demoted. [...] A yokozuna is {{expected}} to retire if {{he can no longer}} compete {{at the peak of the}} sport or in some cases if he is deemed to have not upheld the dignity of the rank. [...] Expectations are so high that, even in the course of one tournament, a yokozuna who early on appears to be headed for a losing tournament will <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> to retire; there are many cases of yokozuna dropping out mid-tournament with a real or imagined injury to avoid a make-koshi (a losing record) and the expectation to retire. These expectations are a large part of the reason that the promotion criteria for yokozuna are so strict in the first place.|$|E
2500|$|A {{female athlete}} who feels {{pressured}} {{to maintain a}} certain physique or body weight may exercise excessively and develop eating disorders to restrict calorie intake. Over-exercising increases the need for rest; her overall energy declines, causing her total body fat and estrogen levels to drop - a condition known as amenorrhea. Both {{male and female athletes}} may <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure</b> to over-train excessively in order to achieve a certain body image. [...] The human body has a tremendous capacity to adapt to physical stress. [...] "Stress" [...] does not mean only physical damage. It can also refer to activity beneficial to bones, muscles, tendons, and ligaments, making them stronger and more functional. This is also known as [...] "remodeling," [...] and involves both the breakdown and buildup of tissue. However, if breakdown occurs more rapidly than buildup, an overuse injury can result. Nearly half of all injuries encountered in pediatric sports medicine are due to overuse. An overuse injury is traumatic damage to a bone, muscle, or tendon that is subjected to repetitive stress without time to heal naturally, as a result of long and/or high-intensity workouts. [...] Many young athletes participate in sports year-round or on multiple teams at once. Another factor could be parental pressure to compete and succeed. Other risk factors include sleep deprivation, general physical and cognitive immaturity, dietary imbalance and inadequate physical fitness. Among young athletes, a common form of overuse injury is stress fractures, which include injuries of the: ...|$|E
2500|$|Lind said of {{assuming}} the role, [...] "The audition for Bianca {{felt like an}} amusement park ride. It was such a thrill {{to go to an}} audition by plane rather than subway! I can only hope I do half of what [...] did with the part. She played it with amazing grace and dignity. Now I need to breathe my own life into it." [...] Regarding Bianca being the [...] "moral center of Pine Valley" [...] and the pressure of being a recast, Lind said she did feel pressure in the beginning. [...] "I did look at some of [...] footage online to prep for it. She, for obvious reasons, was so beautiful, real, and honest in her portrayal of Bianca." [...] Lind stated that it ultimately came down to her not wanting to mimic Riegel: Part of me feels very strongly that [...] created a character that was so well-written, detailed, and complicated, and the element of being gay was part of who she was, but it did not define her. I sort of wanted to take that and breathe my own life into it and do something else by using myself rather than using someone else’s interpretation. I understand these emotions and all humans do, of wanting to support your family and be equal and be in love. Ultimately, I said, [...] "I can <b>feel</b> <b>the</b> <b>pressure,</b> but I am going to let it go." [...] The role is so full and rich that I thought, Well, now I am just going to throw myself into it.|$|E
