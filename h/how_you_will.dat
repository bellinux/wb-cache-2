You will spear one head {{with two of the}} spears, as that one falls, the other will awake and you must quickly raft across the lake and spear the other head with the two {{remaining}} spears. That is <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> kill the serpent." ...|$|E
2500|$|The sisters {{assume that}} Babette will now return to Paris. However, when {{she tells them}} that all of her money is gone and {{that she is not}} going anywhere, the sisters are aghast. Babette then reveals that she was {{formerly}} the head chef of the Café Anglais, and tells them that dinner for 12 there has a price of 10,000 francs. Martine tearfully says, [...] "Now you will be poor the rest of your life", to which Babette replies, [...] "An artist is never poor." [...] Philippa then says: [...] "But this is not the end, Babette. In Paradise you will be the great artist God meant you to be" [...] and then embraces her with tears in her eyes saying: [...] "Oh, <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> enchant the angels!", which is precisely how the short story ends.|$|E
2500|$|Contract law {{concerns}} enforceable promises, and can {{be summed}} up in the Latin phrase pacta sunt servanda (agreements must be kept). In common law jurisdictions, three key elements to the creation of a contract are necessary: offer and acceptance, consideration and the intention to create legal relations. In Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company a medical firm advertised that its new wonder drug, the smokeball, would cure people's flu, and if it did not, the buyers would get £100. Many people sued for their £100 when the drug did not work. Fearing bankruptcy, Carbolic argued the advert was not to be taken as a serious, legally binding offer. It was an invitation to treat, mere puffery, a gimmick. But the Court of Appeal held that to a reasonable man Carbolic had made a serious offer, accentuated by their reassuring statement, [...] "£1000 is deposited". Equally, people had given good consideration for the offer by going to the [...] "distinct inconvenience" [...] of using a faulty product. [...] "Read the advertisement <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>will,</b> and twist it about as you will", said Lord Justice Lindley, [...] "here is a distinct promise expressed in language which is perfectly unmistakable".|$|E

2500|$|An updated {{variant of}} the {{broadcast}} flag has been developed in the Content Protection and Copy Management group under DVB (DVB-CPCM). Upon publication by DVB, the technical specification was submitted to European governments in March 2007. As with much DRM, the CPCM system is intended to control use of copyrighted material by the end-user, {{at the direction of}} the copyright holder. According to Ren Bucholz of the EFF, which paid {{to be a member of}} the consortium, [...] "You won't even know ahead of time whether and <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> be able to record and make use of particular programs or devices". The DVB claims that the system will harmonize copyright holders' control across different technologies, thereby making things easier for end users. The normative sections have now all been approved for publication by the DVB Steering Board, and will be published by ETSI as a formal European Standard as ETSI TS 102 825-X where X refers to the Part number of specification. Nobody has yet stepped forward to provide a Compliance and Robustness regime for the standard (though several are rumoured to be in development), so it is not presently possible to fully implement a system, as there is nowhere to obtain the necessary device certificates.|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] {{the general}} replied. [...] "You had better think the matter over, {{and let me}} know {{tomorrow}} how you had best proceed. It is not an enterprise to be undertaken without thinking it over in every light. You will have to decide whether you will go alone, or take anyone with you; when and <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> land; <b>how</b> <b>you</b> <b>will</b> regain the ships. You will, of course, have carte blanche in all respects." ...|$|E
