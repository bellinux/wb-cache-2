In the present study, a mutagenic vector was constructed and a "plasmid rescue" strategy {{was set up to}} isolate a 16. 5 -kb DNA fragment containing genes required for fluorene degradation. A 14. 5 -kb portion of the cloned DNA was sequenced revealing thirteen open reading frames. Two encoded hypothetical proteins (FldE and FldY) similar to transcriptional regulators and one (ORF 360) located on an IS-like element (ISSsp 126) encoded a putative transposase.

40|$|The {{tripeptide}} {{backbone of}} phosphinothricin (PT) tripeptide (PTT), a compound with herbicidal activity from Streptomyces viridochromogenes, is assembled by three stand-alone peptide synthetase modules. The enzyme PhsA (66 kDa) recruits the PT-precursor N-acetyl-demethylphosphinothricin (N-Ac-DMPT), whereas the two alanine residues of PTT are assembled by the enzymes PhsB and PhsC (129 and 119 kDa, respectively). During or after assembly, the N-Ac-DMPT residue in the peptide {{is converted to}} PT by methylation and deacetylation. Both phsB and phsC appear to be cotranscribed together with two other genes from a single promoter and they are located {{at a distance of}} 20 kb from the gene phsA, encoding PhsA, in the PTT biosynthesis gene cluster of S. viridochromogenes.

40|$|Acquisition, {{delivery}} and incorporation of metals {{to their respective}} metalloproteins are important cellular processes. These processes are tightly controlled so that cells are not exposed to free metal concentrations {{that would lead to}} harmful oxidative damages. Cytochrome c oxidases (Cox) are among these metalloproteins whose assembly and activity involves incorporation of Cu cofactor into their catalytic subunits in addition to the maturation of other subunits. In this study, we focused on the pathways of acquisition of Cu by the facultative phototroph Rhodobacter capsulatus for incorporation into the heme–Cu binuclear center of its cbb 3 –type Cox (cbb 3 –Cox). Genetic screens identified a cbb 3 –Cox defective mutant that requires Cu 2 + supplement to produce an active cbb 3 –Cox. Complementation of this mutant using wild-type genomic libraries unveiled a novel gene (ccoA) required for cbb 3 –Cox biogenesis in R. capsulatus. In the absence of CcoA, cellular content of Cu decreases, and cbb 3 –Cox assembly and activity becomes defective. CcoA shows pronounced homology to Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) type transporter proteins. Members of this family are known to transport small solutes or drugs, but so far, no MFS protein was implicated in cbb 3 –Cox biogenesis.
