40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{production}} of diethyldichlorosilane [(C 2 H 5) 2 SiCl 2]. The catalytic reaction of silicon (Si) of purity 99. 9 % with <b>ethylchloride</b> (C 2 H 5 Cl) was investigated in a fluidized bed reactor. Cuprous chloride (CuCl) of purity 99. 9 % {{was used as a}} catalyst of the reaction. Gas chromatography was used on-line for analysis of the reaction products. The experimental work was carried out using a stainless steel column of 5 cm internal diameter and 50 cm height as the fluidized bed reactor. The experiments start with different bed temperatures between 200 and 300 C to identify the optimum reaction temperature. This temperature was found to be at 250 C, which resulted in the maximum of <b>ethylchloride</b> (EtCl) conversion and diethyldichlorosilane yield. In fifteen runs, the variables considered were sieveanalysis average particle size dp (50, 100, and 150 μm), contact mass weight wt (100 – 200 gm) and reacted gas velocity Ug (1. 41 – 2. 83 cm/s). It was found that the conversion of EtCl increases with decreasing reacted gas velocity, increasing bed contact mass and particle diameter. The yield of Et 2 SiCl 2 was not affected by these variables, but bed temperature was found to have a significant affect. Two mathematical models, the Orcut model and the continuous CSTR model were used to predict theoretical data for the conversion of EtCl. The comparison between the experimental and the theoretical data showed good agreement with an absolute error of less than 9 %. ...|$|E
40|$|CuCl 2 /Al 2 O 3 based {{ethylene}} oxychlorination catalysts {{have been}} characterized by using IR spectroscopy of the surface hydroxy-groups and of adsorbed pyridine and CO 2. The ethylene oxychlorination reaction to 1, 2 -dichloroethane and the dehydrochlorination of <b>ethylchloride</b> (chosen as a probe molecule) have been investigated by using both pulse reactor measurements and in-situ IR experiments in static conditions. Experiments performed over doped alumina and doped CuCl 2 /Al 2 O 3 confirmed that the exposed support surface can be responsible of the dehydrochlorination of 1, 2 -dichloroethane (EDC) to vinyl chloride monomer (VCM), with a consequent loss in selectivity in the oxychlorination reactor. Doping alumina with MgCl 2 and in particular with KCl limits {{the activity of the}} bare support in this side-reaction. © 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|SPME {{techniques}} {{have proven to}} be very useful tools in the analysis of wide VOCs in the air. In this study, we estimated VOCs in ambient and workplace air using a Tedlar ba /SPME/GC/MS system. The calibration curve was set to be linear over the range of 1 - 30 ppbv. The detection limits ranged from 10 pptv to 0. 93 ppbv for all VOCs. Reproducibility of TO- 14 target gas mixtures by SPME/GC/MS averaged at 8. 8 R. S. D (%). Air toxic VOCs (hazardous air pollutants, HAPs) containing a total of forty halohydrocarbons, aromatics, and haloaro-matic carbons could be analyzed with significant accuracy, detection limit and linearity at low ppbv level. Only reactive VOCs with low molecular weight, such as chloromethane, vinylchloride, <b>ethylchloride</b> and 1, 2 -dichloro-ethane, yielded relatively poor results using this technique. In ambient air samples, ten VOCs were identified and quantified after external calibration. VOC concentration in ambient and workplace air ranged from 0. 04 to 1. 85 ppbv. The overall process was successfully applied to identify and quantify VOCs in ambient/workplace air...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} an experimental investigation of synthesis of polystyrene under various polymerization {{conditions such as}} solvent polarity, temperature, initial concentrations of initiator, catalyst, monomer and added salts or co-catalyst, which was achieved using the living cationic polymerization technology in conjunction with gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and NMR spectroscopy. Polymerizations of styrene were conducted using 1 -phenyl <b>ethylchloride</b> (1 -PEC) as an initiator and tin tetrachloride (SnCI 4) as a catalyst {{in the presence of}} tetra-n-Butylammonium chloride (nBu 4 NCI). Effects of solvent polarity varied by mixing dichloromethane (DCM) and less polar cyclohexane (C. hex), temperature, initial concentrations of SnC 14, 1 -PEC and nBu 4 NCI on the polymerizations were examined, and the conditions under which a living polymerization can be obtained were optimised as: [styrene]o ~ 0. 75 - 2 M; [1 -PEC]o ~ 0. 005 - 0. 05 M; [SnCI 4 Jo ~ 0. 05 - 0. 4 M; [nBu 4 NCIJo ~ 0. 001 - 0. 1 M; DCM/C. hex ~ 50 / 0 - 20 / 30 v/v; T ~ 0 to - 45 °C. Kinetic studies of styrene polymerization using the Omnifit sampling method showed that the number average molecular weight (Mn) of the polymers obtained increased in direct proportion to monomer conversion and agreed well with the theoretical Mn expected from the concentration ratios of monomer to initiator. The linearities of both the 1 n([MJoI[M]) vs. time plot and the Mn vs. monomer conversion plot, and the narrow molecular weight distribution (MWD) measured using GPC demonstrated the livingness of the polymerizations, indicating the absence of irreversible termination and transfer within the lifetimes of the polymerizations. The proposed 'two species' propagation mechanism was found to apply for the styrene polymerization with 1 -PEC/SnCI 4 in the presence of nBu 4 NCl. The further kinetic experiments showed that living styrene polymerizations were achieved using the 1 -PEC/SnCI 4 initiating system in mixtures of DCM/C. hex 30 / 20 v/v at - 15 °C in the presence of various bromide salts, tetra-n-butylammonium bromide, tetra-n-pentylammonium bromide, tetra-n-heptylammonium bromide, and tetra-n-octylammonium bromide, respectively. The types of the bromide salts were found to have no significant effect on monomer conversion, Mn, polydispersity and initiation efficiency. Living polymerizations of styrene were also achieved using titanium tetrachloride (TiCI 4) as a catalyst and 1 -PEC as an initiator {{in the presence of a}} small amount of 2, 6 -di-tert-butylpyridine or pyridine instead of nBu 4 NCl. GPC analysis showed that the polymers obtained had narrow polydispersities (P. D. < 1. 3), and the linearities of both the In([MJo/[MJ) vs. time plot and the Mn vs. monomer conversion plot demonstrated that the polymerizations are living, when the ratio of DCM and C. hex was less than 40 : 10 and the reaction temperature was not lower than - 15 °C. The reaction orders relative to TiCl 4 and 1 -PEC were estimated from the investigations into the rate of polymerization to be 2. 56 and 1. 0 respectively. lH and 13 C NMR analysis of the resultant polystyrene would suggest the end-functionality of the product polymers is chlorine for all living polymerizations...|$|E
