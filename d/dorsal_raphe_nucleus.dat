2500|$|Furthermore, GIRKs {{have been}} found {{to play a role in}} a group of serotonergic neurons in the <b>dorsal</b> <b>raphe</b> <b>nucleus,</b> {{specifically}} those associated with the neuropeptide hormone orexin. [...] The 5-HT1A receptor, a serotonin receptor and type of GPCR, has been shown to be coupled directly with the α-subunit of a G protein, while the βγ-complex activates GIRK without use of a second messenger. The subsequent activation of the GIRK channel mediates hyperpolarization of orexin neurons, which regulate the release of many other neurotransmitters including noradrenaline and acetylcholine.|$|E
2500|$|Antagonism of the α2-adrenergic receptors, which {{function}} {{largely as}} inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors, enhances adrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission, notably central 5-HT1A receptor mediated transmission in the <b>dorsal</b> <b>raphe</b> <b>nucleus</b> and hippocampus; hence, mirtazapine's classification as a NaSSA. Indirect α1 adrenoceptor-mediated enhancement of serotonin cell firing and direct blockade of inhibitory α2 heteroreceptors located on serotonin terminals are {{held responsible for}} the increase in extracellular serotonin. Because of this, mirtazapine has been said to be a functional [...] "indirect agonist" [...] of the 5-HT1A receptor. Increased activation of the central 5-HT1A receptor is thought to be a major mediator of efficacy of most antidepressant drugs.|$|E
40|$|The {{norepinephrine}} transporter (NET) is a site {{of action}} for tricyclic antidepressant drugs and for drugs of abuse such as amphetamine and cocaine. In this study, the binding of [3 H]nisoxetine to NETs in the noradrenergic cell group, the locus coeruleus, and the serotonergic cell groups, the <b>dorsal</b> <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei,</b> was measured autoradiographically in postmortem human brain. [3 H]nisoxetine binding was unevenly distributed along the rostral–caudal axis of the locus coeruleus and correlated positively with numbers of neuromelanin-containing (noradrenergic) cells along the axis of the locus coeruleus within individuals. Binding densities of [3 H]nisoxetine in <b>dorsal</b> <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei</b> were {{similar to that in}} the locus coeruleus. [3 H]nisoxetine binding was unevenly distributed along the entire rostral–caudal extent of the <b>dorsal</b> <b>raphe,</b> with the highest binding occurring in the interfascicular and ventral nuclei. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{amino acid}} glycine {{is a major}} {{inhibitory}} neurotransmitter in the brainstem and is likely involved in the tonic inhibition of the monoaminergic neurons during all sleep-waking stages. In {{order to determine the}} neurons at the origin of the glycinergic innervation of the two principal monoaminergic nuclei, the locus coeruleus and the <b>dorsal</b> <b>raphe</b> of the rat, we applied a double-labelling technique, combining retrograde transport of cholera-toxin B subunit with glycine immunohistochemistry. Using this technique, we found that the locus coeruleus and <b>dorsal</b> <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei</b> receive a common glycinergic innervation from the ventral and ventrolateral periaqueductal grey, including the adjacent deep mesencephalic reticular nucleus. Small additional glycinergic inputs to these nuclei originated from the lateral paragigantocellular nucleus and the rostral ventromedial medullary reticular formation. The potential role of these glycinergic inputs in the control of the excitability of the monoaminergic neurons of the locus coeruleus and <b>dorsal</b> <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei</b> is discussed...|$|R

40|$|The kynurenine (KYN) pathway, {{which is}} initi-ated by {{indoleamine}} 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO), {{is a key}} tryptophan (TRP) metabolic pathway. It shares TRP with the serotonin (5 -HT) pathway. Because activation of the KYN pathway by proinflammatory cytokines induces depressive symptoms, shifts {{in the balance of}} TRP metabolism to the KYN pathway are closely related to the etiology of depression. In the present study, the influence of age on the effect of the inflammation response system (IRS) on brain TRP metabolism was investigated. Male ICR mice (PND 21) were reared for 4 weeks (younger group) or until they reached 1 year of age (older group), and given an intraperitoneal (i. p.) injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The TRP, KYN, and 5 -HT levels were measured in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and <b>dorsal</b> <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei.</b> An increase in TRP and 5 -HT levels was observed with age in all brain regions, whereas age was associated with decreases in KYN levels in the <b>dorsal</b> <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei.</b> In all brain regions, LPS increased TRP levels, while it in-creased KYN levels in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala. Reduced KYN/ 5 -HT ratios in all regions were observed with age, whereas increased KYN/ 5 -HT ratios were observed with LPS in all regions except the <b>dorsal</b> <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Thus, age shifted the balance between the KYN and 5 -HT pathways toward the 5 -HT pathway, and countered the effects of LPS, which shifted the balance to the KYN pathway. These effects are relevant to the etiology of psychiatric disorders in elderly people...|$|R
40|$|Neuronal losses {{have been}} shown to occur in the {{brainstem}} following a neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic (HI) insult. In particular serotonergic neurons, situated in the <b>dorsal</b> <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei,</b> appear to be vulnerable to HI injury. Nonetheless the mechanisms contributing to losses of serotonergic neurons in the brainstem remain to be elucidated. One possible mechanism is that disruption of neural projections from damaged forebrain areas to <b>dorsal</b> <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei</b> {{may play a role in}} the demise of serotonergic neurons. To test this, postnatal day 3 (P 3) rat pups underwent unilateral common carotid artery ligation followed by hypoxia (6 % O- 2 for 30 min). On P 38 a retrograde tracer, fluorescent-coupled choleratoxin b, was deposited in the <b>dorsal</b> <b>raphe</b> <b>dorsal</b> (DR <b>dorsal)</b> <b>nucleus</b> or the <b>dorsal</b> <b>raphe</b> ventral (DR ventral) nucleus. Compared to control animals, P 3 HI animals had significant losses of retrogradely labelled neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex, preoptic area and lateral habenula after tracer deposit in the DR dorsal nucleus. On the other hand, after tracer deposit in the DR ventral nucleus, we found significant reductions in numbers of retrogradely labelled neurons in the hypothalamus, preoptic area and medial amygdala in P 3 HI animals compared to controls. Since losses of descending inputs are associated with decreases in serotonergic neurons in the brainstem <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei,</b> we propose that disruption of certain descending neural inputs from the forebrain to the DR dorsal and the DR ventral nuclei may contribute to losses of serotonergic neurons after P 3 HI. It is important to delineate the phenotypes of different neuronal networks affected by neonatal HI, and the mechanisms underpinning this damage, so that interventions can be devised to target and protect axons from the harmful effects of neonatal HI.

40|$|SummaryThe serotonergic <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei</b> of the {{midbrain}} are principal centers {{from which}} serotonin neurons project to innervate cortical and sub-cortical structures. The <b>dorsal</b> <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei</b> receive light {{input from the}} circadian visual system [1] and indirect input from the biological clock nuclei [2, 3]. Dysregulation of serotonin neurotransmission is implicated in neurobehavioral disorders, such as depression and anxiety [4], and alterations in the serotonergic phenotype of raphe neurons have dramatic effects on affective behaviors in rodents [5]. Here, we demonstrate that day length (photoperiod) during development induces enduring changes in mouse <b>dorsal</b> <b>raphe</b> serotonin neurons—programming their firing rate, responsiveness to noradrenergic stimulation, intrinsic electrical properties, serotonin and norepinephrine content in the midbrain, and depression/anxiety-related behavior in a melatonin receptor 1 (MT 1) -dependent manner. Our results establish mechanisms by which seasonal photoperiods may dramatically and persistently alter the function of serotonin neurons...|$|R

5000|$|SERT is {{responsible}} for the reuptake of extracellular serotonin (5-HT) in a Na +/Cl − -dependent process.

Regulation of SERT has been linked to acute depletion of intracellular Ca Na 2+, calmodulin inhibition, CaMKII, Src, p38 MAP kinase, PKC, and activation of NOS/cGMP.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{have studied}} 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) release in the hippocampal {{formation}} following electrical {{stimulation of the}} <b>dorsal</b> and median <b>raphé</b> <b>nuclei</b> in the behaving rat. The primary finding {{in this study is}} a decrease in neuronal release of serotonin in the dorsal hippocampal formation following electrical stimulation of either the <b>dorsal</b> or median <b>raphé</b> <b>nucleus</b> in conscious rats. At no time did electrical stimulation of either <b>raphé</b> <b>nucleus</b> result in behavioral, including vigilance state, changes. The amount of 5 -HT released was found to be frequency dependent with higher frequencies (20 Hz) producing larger decreases in release of 5 -HT. However, the pattern of release differs between the two <b>raphé</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Extracellular levels of 5 -HT decrease during stimulation of the <b>dorsal</b> <b>raphé,</b> whereas levels decrease only following cessation of stimulation of the median <b>raphé</b> <b>nucleus.</b> This may relate to the patterns of innervation of the dorsal hippocampal formation by these two midbrain <b>raphé</b> <b>nuclei</b> and also may reflect an inhibition of media...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} {{of gender and}} age on adenylyl cyclase activity was investigated, through a Dowex-alumina double step chromatographic procedure, in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and <b>dorsal</b> <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei</b> obtained from autopsy cadavers.

Lastly, basal values correlated positively with forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in all areas except the prefrontal cortex of the male subjects. Positive significant correlations were also found between both forskolin-stimulated enzyme activity and percentage forskolin stimulation and aging in the prefrontal cortex.

40|$|Serotonergic fibres have a {{pervasive}} innervation of hypoxic-ischemic (HI) -affected {{areas in the}} neonatal brain and serotonin (5 -HT) is pivotal in numerous neurobehaviours that match many HI-induced deficits. However, {{little is known about}} how neonatal HI affects the serotonergic system. We therefore examined whether neonatal HI can alter numbers of serotonergic raphe neurons in specific sub-divisions of the midbrain and brainstem since these nuclei are the primary sources of serotonin throughout the central nervous system (CNS). We utilised an established neonatal HI model in the postnatal day 3 (P 3) rat pup (right common carotid artery ligation + 30 min 6 % O(2)) and determined the effects of P 3 HI on 5 -HT counts in 5 raphe sub-divisions in the midbrain and brainstem one and six weeks later. After P 3 HI, numbers of 5 -HT-positive neurons were significantly decreased in the <b>dorsal</b> <b>raphe</b> <b>dorsal,</b> <b>dorsal</b> <b>raphe</b> ventrolateral and <b>dorsal</b> <b>raphe</b> caudal <b>nuclei</b> on P 10 but only in the <b>dorsal</b> <b>raphe</b> <b>dorsal</b> and <b>dorsal</b> <b>raphe</b> ventrolateral <b>nuclei</b> on P 45. In contrast, P 3 HI did not alter counts in the <b>dorsal</b> <b>raphe</b> interfascicular and <b>raphe</b> magnus <b>nuclei.</b> We also discovered that P 3 HI significantly reduces brainstem SERT protein expression; the key regulator of 5 -HT in the CNS. In conclusion, neonatal HI injury caused significant disruption of the brainstem serotonergic system that can persist for up to six weeks after the insult. The different vulnerabilities of serotonergic populations in specific <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei</b> suggest that certain <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei</b> may underpin neurological deficits in HI-affected neonates through to adulthood.

This output inhibits dopamine neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta and the ventral tegmental area, with activation in the lateral habenula linking to deactivation in them, and vice versa, deactivation in the lateral habenula with their activation. The lateral habenula functions {{to oppose the}} action of the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus in the acquisition of avoidance responses but not the processing of avoidance later on when it is a memory, motivation or its execution.

Here we studied the effect of serotonin and serotonin pharmacological compounds on the outgrowth of serotonergic projections using organotypic slice co-cultures of hippocampus and <b>dorsal</b> <b>raphe</b> <b>nuclei.</b> Immunocytochemical analysis showed that several serotonergic neurites had grown into the target slice within 7 days in culture, after which the neurite density stabilized. These projections expressed the serotonin-synthesizing enzyme Tryptophan hydroxylase and the serotonin transporter and contained several serotonin-positive varicosities that also accumulated presynaptic markers. Chronic application of a 5 -HT(2) agonist reduced the serotonergic neurite density, without effects on survival of serotonergic neurons. In contrast, application of a 5 -HT(1 A) agonist or the serotonin transporter inhibitor fluoxetine did not affect serotonergic neurite density.
