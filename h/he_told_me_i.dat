I took exception to his remarks, and retorted: 'I will go as far as you dare go. Don't forget that.' ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the {{preparation}} she did for the film, actor Aishwarya Rai {{said in an interview}} that both herself and the director Bhansali [...] ".. just like to walk randomly around the sets and [...] "feel".

I was looking at the ground, lost in deep thought and he clicked it and told me that he was putting it on his poster. He knows when I am ready to do a scene, when I am in character, and the like.
