As her friend, Kate hopes that this situation does not harm Janet's credibility at the university, although she finds that many of the professors no longer care for Janet. Although Kate defends Janet, it is no use. Many people ridicule Janet and seem to <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> get to know her better.|$|E
25|$|I {{wrote in}} {{detail about the}} Holocaust and said I {{did not want to}} discuss numbers. I quoted an {{argument}} between historians in which various numbers of casualties were mentioned. One wrote there were 12million victims and another wrote there were 800,000. I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> argue with the figures. The Holocaust was a terrible, unforgivable crime against the Jewish nation, a crime against humanity that cannot be accepted by humankind. The Holocaust was a terrible thing and nobody can claim I denied it.|$|E

The government arranged for the BBC to administer a Digital Switchover Help Scheme to ensure that groups such as the over-75s and recipients of disability benefits did not lose their television services when analogue transmissions were switched off.|$|E

25|$|The Village of Wish: This is {{the tiny}} town of Wish, where Lyra lives with her parents, Fidget and Faye, and her grandparents, Tangle and Aeval. It’s an insular place, far from cities and civilization. The town is {{surrounded}} by tall walls, not to keep the residents inside, for they <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> leave the safety and warmth of their community. The walls are there to keep the outside world outside, and are secured with complex weighted locks first seen in Dream Chronicles. The streets are cobbled, lined with colorful dwellings and stores. Beyond the walls of Wish lie lush forests and winding roads that, eventually, lead to other larger towns. But the folk of Wish have little desire to visit those distant places. Their homes are secure in their beloved village where, they believe, no harm can come to them.|$|E

500|$|Later in 1957, Cagney ventured {{behind the}} camera {{for the first and}} only time to direct Short Cut to Hell, a remake of the 1941 Alan Ladd film This Gun for Hire, which in turn was based on the Graham Greene novel A Gun for Sale. Cagney had long been told by friends that he would make an {{excellent}} director, so when he was approached by his friend, producer A. C. Lyles, he instinctively said yes. He refused all offers of payment, saying he was an actor, not a director. The film was low budget, and shot quickly. As Cagney recalled, [...] "We shot it in twenty days, and that was long enough for me. I find directing a bore, I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> tell other people their business".|$|E

500|$|Lieutenant Lillian Pimlott {{wrote to}} her mother, after being {{deployed}} to Pearl Harbor, and said, [...] "I {{was fascinated by the}} ships which are making history in every battle. I've talked to seamen and I've met flyers-from Iwo (Iwo Jima), from Okinawa, heroes from every encounter. I know now what war means and {{my heart goes out to}} every one of them. Among them I am making, I hope, life long friends, for their experiences mean everything to my self-satisfaction... As long as they fight on, I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> return home, for I feel I belong here... I have learned much in these brief three months about life and living. And I know I have already changed in many ways and many viewpoints... It is truly a most broadening experience and I shall never outlive it".|$|E

People need to know that I loved him. He was a good kid, a good boy." [...] Although acknowledging that Leelah had requested transition surgery, Carla stated that she had never heard her child use the name [...] "Leelah", before reiterating her refusal to accept her child's transgender status, adding [...] "We don't support that, religiously." [...] She expressed concern that users of social media thought her to be a [...] "horrible person", but defended her actions in dealing with her child, stating for example that she had banned internet access to prevent access to [...] "inappropriate" [...] things. In an email to Cincinnati-based channel WCPO-TV, Leelah's father Doug Alcorn wrote, [...] "We love our son, Joshua, very much and are devastated by his death. We <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> enter into a political storm or debate with people who did not know him. We wish to grieve in private. We harbor no ill will towards anyone. ...

2500|$|Baldwin's {{vice presidential}} run, and Peroutka's {{withdrawal}} from the national Constitution Party, led to active 2006 speculation that Baldwin would seek the presidential nomination in 2008. Baldwin responded in October that [...] "I have learned to never say never, but I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> run. [...] would require several 'miraculous' signs of reassurance that, frankly, I cannot see happening. However, I am always open to God's will." [...] He repeated this stance through March 2008.|$|E
2500|$|According to Roger Ebert {{from the}} Chicago Sun-Times, {{the film was}} met with two extremes, one side being overall positive, while the other side being the exact opposite.

2500|$|Regarding {{his writing}} style, Abbey states: [...] "I {{write in a}} {{deliberately}} provocative and outrageous manner because I like to startle people. I hope to wake up people. I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> simply soothe or please. I would rather risk making people angry than putting them to sleep. And I try to write in a style that's entertaining as well as provocative. It's {{hard for me to}} stay serious {{for more than half a}} page at a time." [...] Abbey felt that it was the duty of all authors to [...] "speak the truth--especially unpopular truth. Especially truth that offends the powerful, the rich, the well-established, the traditional, the mythic".|$|E
2500|$|On 18 March 1871, {{he wrote}} to his (confederate) friend Félix Bracquemond in Paris about his visit to Bordeaux, the provisory seat of the French National Assembly of the Third French Republic where Émile Zola {{introduced}} him to the sites: [...] "I never imagined that France could be represented by such doddering old fools, not excepting that little twit Thiers..." [...] If this could be interpreted as support of the Commune, a following letter to Bracquemond (21 March 1871) expressed his idea more clearly: [...] "Only party hacks and the ambitious, the Henrys of this world following {{on the heels of the}} Milliéres, the grotesque imitators of the Commune of 1793..." [...] He knew the communard Lucien Henry to have been a former painter's model and Millière, an insurance agent. [...] "What an encouragement all these bloodthirsty caperings are for the arts! But there is at least one consolation in our misfortunes: that we're not politicians and <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> be elected as deputies".|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{opposition}} to Muslim immigration, Fortuyn explained that, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> go through the emancipation of women and homosexuals all over again." [...] In August 2001, Fortuyn {{was quoted in the}} Rotterdams Dagblad newspaper saying, [...] "I am also in favour of a cold war with Islam. I see Islam as an extraordinary threat, as a hostile religion." [...] In the TV program, Business class, Fortuyn said that Muslims in the Netherlands did not accept Dutch society. He appeared on the program several times. It was moderated by his friend Harry Mens. Since his death, commentators have suggested Fortuyn's words were interpreted rather harshly, if not wrongly. For instance, he said that Muslims in the Netherlands needed to accept living together with the Dutch, and that if this was unacceptable for them, then they were free to leave. His concluding words in the TV program were [...] "...I want to live together with the Muslim people, but [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|Barnum enjoyed what he {{publicly}} dubbed [...] "profitable philanthropy." [...] In Barnum's own words: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> {{be considered}} {{much of a}} philanthropist...if by improving and beautifying our city Bridgeport, Connecticut, and adding to the pleasure and prosperity of my neighbors, I can do so at a profit, the incentive to 'good works' will be twice as strong {{as if it were}} otherwise." [...] In line with this philosophy was Barnum's pursuit of major American museums and spectacles. Less known are Barnum's significant contributions to Tufts University. Barnum was appointed to the Board of Trustees prior to the University's founding and made several significant contributions to the fledgling institution. The most noteworthy example of this was his gift in 1883 of $50,000 ($2,000,000 in 2013), to establish a museum and hall for the Department of Natural History, which today houses the department of biology. Because of the relationship between Barnum and Tufts, Jumbo the elephant became the school's mascot, and Tufts students are known as [...] "Jumbos." ...|$|E
2500|$|The ritualistic {{elements}} {{involved in}} the execution of Coleman’s murder {{may have been in}} response to a public sermon made three years earlier by Brigham Young on March 3, 1863. In this sermon, Young states, “I am a human being, and I have the care of human beings. I wish to save life, and <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> destroy life. If I had my wish, I should entirely stop the shedding of human blood.” Following this statement, however, Young makes a statement regarding interracial relations in which he continues, [...] "Shall I tell you the law of God in regard to the African race? If the white man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of Cain, the penalty, under the law of God, is death on the spot. This will always be so." [...] Young continues his sermon by condemning whites for their abuse of slaves with the proclamation, “for their abuse of that race, the whites will be cursed, unless they repent.” ...|$|E
2500|$|But {{if people}} with firmly held {{negative}} self-views seek self-verification, {{this does not}} mean that they are masochistic or <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> be loved. In fact, even people with very low self-esteem want to be loved. What sets people with negative self-views apart is their ambivalence about the evaluations they receive. Just as positive evaluations foster joy and warmth initially, these feelings are later chilled by incredulity. And although negative evaluations may foster sadness that the [...] "truth" [...] could not be kinder, it will at least reassure them that they know themselves. Happily, people with negative self-views are the exception rather than the rule. That is, on the balance, most people tend to view themselves positively. Although this imbalance is adaptive for society at large, it poses a challenge to researchers interested in studying self-verification. That is, for theorists interested in determining if behavior is driven by self-verification or positivity strivings, participants with positive self-views will reveal nothing because both motives compel them to seek positive evaluations. If researchers want to learn if people prefer verification or positivity in a giving setting, they must study people with negative self-views.|$|E
