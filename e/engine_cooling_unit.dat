5000|$|The NEKAF jeeps {{differed}} from the US version by adding side reflectors (white in front and red at the rear), low intensity [...] "city lights" [...] on the front fenders and front and rear mounted directional signals. In a bid to reduce the costs, the Ministry of War, having invested already in clothing for the crews, ordered the cabin heaters to be deleted. This modification entailed considerable redesign of the <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>unit</b> which eventually led to increased cost of the vehicles (some 12,000 Dutch Florins each). The jeeps, dubbed NEKAF by the military, started to enter service in 1956 and remained so well into the 1990s albeit on reservist duties. The NEKAF jeep saw action in the brief Dutch Indonesian war in 1962, but particularly during the UNIFIL operation in which an armoured infantry battalion participated from 1979 till 1983, the NEKAF {{turned out to be}} a robust and reliable vehicle in South Lebanon. Upon withdrawal of the Dutch battalion all UNIFIL NEKAFs were dismantled and sold locally as scrap, save three NEKAFs that were secretly withheld and privately driven back to the Netherlands. One of these sole surviving UNIFIL NEKAFs is now in the collection of the Legermuseum Delft (the Dutch Army Museum).|$|E

40|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>cooling</b> {{and thermal}} {{management}} system is very essential in an automotive industry. It has been existed for decades but only recently been explored for revolution. This study explores current conventional <b>engine</b> <b>cooling,</b> specifically detailing out specifications for wax type conventional thermostat and engine driven water pump. In conventional cooling study, improvement {{has been made}} on thermostat opening temperature. Actual experimental set up has been installed and result recorded. Impact on this change has been studied in term of engine coolant inlet and outlet temperature, radiator, bypass flow rate and also Euro 3 emission compliance. This study also highlights the limitation of current conventional <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> and thermal management system, thus requiring revolution to the system. Advanced <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> and thermal management system is then explored as a revolution of <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> and thermal management system. This further brings us to study on electrification of <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> components mainly on electric control valve and electric water pump. The control system is also improved through integration between <b>engine</b> input/output and <b>cooling</b> input /output for optimum combination. 2 case studies have been reviewed which are Chevrolet Tahoe, 5. 77 litre (Chalgren Jr, 2004) and Ford Excursion 6. 0 liter diesel (Chalgren and Allen, 2005). In these two studies, electric water pump, electric valve, dual variable speed fan and also restrictor at bypass to boost heater core coolant flow have been fully examined and effect on <b>engine</b> <b>cooling</b> and thermal management system is observed. A lot of improvement seen from this revolution namely improvement in fuel consumption, reduced warm up time, better emission control, better cabin temperature during cold start, better coolant temperature fluctuation and also reduction in parasitic loss. ...|$|R
