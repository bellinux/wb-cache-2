500|$|Maggie has {{performed}} {{a number of}} feats that suggest she is a genius. She has spelled out E=MC² with her baby blocks, driven Homer's car, escaped from the Springfield daycare center, written her name on an Etch A Sketch, played Internet poker, and treated her pacifier like a cigarette. However, {{the rest of the}} Simpsons family are unaware of Maggie's maturity and Marge carries Maggie wherever they go rather than letting her walk by herself. Maggie is keenly aware of her surroundings, and can usually be seen imitating the flow of action around her. She shows a high degree of dexterity, and she once hit Homer on the head with a mallet and shot a dart at a photograph of him in imitation of Itchy and Scratchy. Despite her age, Maggie is a formidable marksman, as seen in [...] "Who Shot Mr. Burns?" [...] where she shoots Mr. Burns with a handgun that falls into her hands, and in a more intentional manner during [...] "Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge" [...] where she is able to non-fatally shoot a group of mobsters in rapid succession with a rifle that she apparently hides in <b>her</b> <b>crib.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Yolande Geralds, who also directed the clip for Songz's previous single. [...] "I Invented Sex." [...] The video was filmed on October 7, 2009. Wynter Gordon, DJ Clue as well as Jessica White performing {{the owner of the}} Party make appearances in the video. Stills from the clip were released on the following day, October 8, 2009. A combination video was released for the dual clips of [...] "Say Aah" [...] and [...] "I Invented Sex" [...] and the videos were also released separately. Songz confirmed to MTV News in November 2009 that the latter would be a continuation of the previous. On the video, Songz said that he wanted the video to be [...] "sexy" [...] and [...] "adult" [...] in which everyone had fun. He further explained, [...] "The song speaks on more so a club atmosphere, but the video is more lofty — sexy women all over the place, adults having fun. This one lady in particular, she's representing the independent women without taking it over the top. She's got her own. She takes me back to <b>her</b> <b>crib</b> — so we invent sex together." [...] In a review of the video, calling the song itself [...] "ballerific", Chris Ryan of MTV Buzzworthy said, [...] "the video keeps it pretty grown in sexy", commenting the choice of button down shirts as attire and commending Fabolous's part, which he said, [...] "has a very plain-spoken feel to it, and because his blue-framed shades are matching his shirt.".|$|E
2500|$|When Beppo is {{released}} from jail, he learns that Corrigan's young daughter is ill and vows to avenge his son's death by killing Corrigan's daughter. [...] Beppo sneaks into Corrigan's house, {{but when he}} sees Corrigan's daughter lying in <b>her</b> <b>crib,</b> he cannot act on his plan, and he leaves the child unharmed.|$|E
60|$|Then she {{lay down}} in <b>her</b> cosey <b>crib</b> with the pink cover and the lace curtains, and fell fast asleep, glad to have clean sheets, soft blankets, and her own little pillow once more.|$|R
60|$|From {{this room}} two doorways led into smaller chambers. In one a woman lay asleep, {{with a baby}} beside <b>her</b> in a <b>crib.</b>|$|R
60|$|All {{the bustle}} of {{preparation}} ceased--the presents were forgotten or lay about unfinished, as if no one now had a heart to put their hand to any thing; while up in <b>her</b> little <b>crib</b> lay the beloved one, tossing and burning with restless fever, and without power to recognize any of the loved faces that bent over her.|$|R
2500|$|Often {{a player}} is {{confronted with a}} conundrum: You have good cards to hold but must throw to your {{opponent}} cards {{that are likely to}} score significantly in his (or <b>her)</b> <b>crib.</b> If you are dealt a hand composed of 10-10-8-7-6-2, your best opportunity to score points is to hold the 8-7-6-2: fifteen four and a run of three make seven. More importantly, this hand can be cut to ten, eleven, twelve, fourteen or sixteen. But to what extent does throwing a pair of 10s mitigate the usefulness of holding the deuce? By throwing a 10-deuce, the likelihood your opponent will score significantly in the crib is reduced, while your hand's possibilities still range from five (two less than thrown the [...] "better" [...] way, offset by throwing two less points to the crib) to twelve. The opponent's largest possible crib, your having thrown a 10-2, is fourteen, whereas throwing a pair of 10s offers the maximal possibility of twenty-two.(10,10,5,5,5) ...|$|E
60|$|Glynn {{returned}} the squeeze, and {{opening the door}} of Ailie's private cabin, entered and sat down beside <b>her</b> <b>crib.</b>|$|E
60|$|I got on to <b>her</b> <b>crib</b> {{and kissed}} her: her {{forehead}} was cold, and her cheek both cold and thin, {{and so were}} her hand and wrist; but she smiled as of old.|$|E
60|$|But luxurious as it was, Kate for {{the first}} time {{thoroughly}} missed home. The boarded floor, the old crib, the deal table, would have been welcome, if only Sylvia had been there. She had never gone to bed without Sylvia in her life. And now she thought with a pang that Sylvia was longing for her, and looking at <b>her</b> empty <b>crib,</b> thinking too, it might be, that Kate had cared more for her grandeur than for the parting.|$|R
5000|$|An uncollected story {{written by}} J. D. Salinger, [...] "The Long Debut of Lois Taggett" [...] is {{the tale of}} a debutante and her long process of coming out. Throughout this story, Lois struggles to deal with the {{harshness}} of reality and maintain her own humanity. Before she can let go of pretense, she must first deal with a psychotic husband, a loveless second marriage, and <b>her</b> child's <b>crib</b> death. It was first published in the September 1942 edition of Story.|$|R
50|$|While {{the family}} started {{wondering}} {{where the real}} Archie went, he was at Zelena’s, watching the baby while she and The Evil Queen went to the spa and {{catch up on the}} bonding with the Evil Queen convincing Zelena that she can embrace her wickedness without losing her daughter, as she admits to having lied to Henry about caring for him as a son. When they return home, Zelena turns Archie into a cricket once again, putting him in a cage that hangs above <b>her</b> baby’s <b>crib.</b>|$|R
60|$|Louise went to {{the nursery}} to kiss little Jane. The baby lay in <b>her</b> <b>crib,</b> fast asleep. Near her sat Mildred Travers, reading a book. Crouched in the window-seat was Inez, hugging her knees and gazing moodily out into the garden.|$|E
60|$|Let {{us look at}} Mrs Frog's room now, {{and listen}} {{to her as she}} sits on one side of a cheerful fire, sewing, while Hetty sits on the other side, {{similarly}} occupied, and Matty, alias Mita, lies in <b>her</b> <b>crib</b> sound asleep.|$|E
60|$|She {{took some}} tiny article of raiment {{from the chair}} at <b>her</b> <b>crib</b> side, and with it covered her shoulders. I {{suffered}} her to do as she pleased. Listening awhile in the darkness, I was aware that she still wept,--wept under restraint, quietly and cautiously.|$|E
60|$|In church it {{was with}} Lady Constantine as with the Lord Angelo of Vienna in a similar situation--Heaven had her empty words only, and her {{invention}} heard not her tongue. She soon recovered from the momentary consternation into which she had fallen at Swithin's abrupt query. The possibility of that young astronomer becoming a renowned scientist by her aid was a thought which gave her secret pleasure. The course of rendering him instant material help began {{to have a great}} fascination for her; it was a new and unexpected channel for <b>her</b> <b>cribbed</b> and confined emotions. With experiences so much wider than his, Lady Constantine saw that the chances were perhaps a million to one against Swithin St. Cleeve ever being Astronomer Royal, or Astronomer Extraordinary of any sort; yet the remaining chance in his favour was one of those possibilities which, to a woman of bounding intellect and venturesome fancy, are pleasanter to dwell on than likely issues that have no savour of high speculation in them. The equatorial question was a great one; and she had caught such a large spark from his enthusiasm that she could think of nothing so piquant as how to obtain the important instrument.|$|R
2500|$|While {{the family}} started {{wondering}} {{where the real}} Archie went, he was at Zelena’s, watching the baby while she and The Evil Queen went to the spa and {{catch up on the}} bonding with the Evil Queen convincing [...] Zelena that she can embrace her wickedness without losing her daughter, as she admits to having lied to Henry about caring for him as a son.

5000|$|The Warren Commission found that, in {{the weeks}} before the assassination, Oswald kept the rifle wrapped in a blanket and hidden in the garage of friends Michael and Ruth Paine, where Marina was living at the time, and Oswald would {{occasionally}} visit. Michael Paine described [...] "a package wrapped in a blanket", which he thought was camping equipment. He did find this odd, saying to himself [...] "they don't make camping equipment of iron pipes any more". Marina testified that, after she and Lee moved their belongings to the Paine home in September 1963, she found the rifle in the blanket while searching for a part for <b>her</b> child's <b>crib.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Instantly {{the ropes}} were eased off, {{and in a}} few seconds the boat was in the sea and on the shore. They found little Brown-eyes sound asleep in <b>her</b> <b>crib,</b> with a river of red-hot lava {{stretching}} its fiery tongues towards her as if eager for a meal! ...|$|E
60|$|The {{breaking}} day {{showed her}} purposes grotesque and monstrous. The revulsion that must come, {{came with a}} tide that swept before it all prepossessions, all affections. It {{seemed as if the}} child, still asleep in <b>her</b> <b>crib,</b> had heard what she said, and would help to hold her to her word.|$|E
6000|$|Curious! I had {{certainly}} deemed Madame in her bed, and Désirée in <b>her</b> <b>crib,</b> at this blessed minute, sleeping, both of them, the sleep of the just, within the sacred walls, amidst the profound seclusion of the Rue Fossette. Most certainly also {{they did not}} picture [...] "Meess Lucie" [...] otherwise engaged; and here we all three were taking our [...] "ébats" [...] in the fête-blazing park at midnight! ...|$|E
50|$|Carolina has a contralto vocal range. Her musical {{influence}} {{comes from}} the <b>crib,</b> <b>her</b> grandmother used to sing on the radio, and her great aunt and uncle played percussion, piano, cello, and violin. She {{grew up listening to}} Brazilian musical icons such as Chico Buarque, João Bosco, Maria Bethânia as well as international icons such as Nina Simone, Björk, and Alanis Morissette. She began her career singing in local bars.|$|R
60|$|He {{left his}} own {{apartment}} {{and went to}} the bedroom where his infant child lay asleep in <b>her</b> little <b>crib.</b> He sat watching her, and thinking quietly and tenderly of many past events in his life for a long time, then returned to his room. A sudden sense of loneliness came upon him after his visit to the child's bedside; but he did not attempt to raise his spirits even then by going to the ball. He descended instead to his study, lighted his reading-lamp, and then, opening a bureau, took from one of the drawers in it the letter which Nanina had written to him. This {{was not the first time}} that a sudden sense of his solitude had connected itself inexplicably with the remembrance of the work-girl's letter.|$|R
50|$|Bruna's musical {{influence}} {{comes from}} the <b>crib.</b> <b>Her</b> maternal grandmother, Maria Piedade was a radio singer in the '50s. Her paternal grandfather, Jamil Caram is a guitarist. Bruna grew up surrounded by singers, composers and instrumentalists of all kinds. She studied piano since age of 7. Starting {{at the age of}} nine she won for an entire decade, as part of the Trovadores Mirins and then of the Trovadores Urbanos, in left field and valuable mileage in contact with the most diverse audiences. In 2005 she won the award 'Festival Interunesp 2005 de Ilha Solteira'.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Almost; and {{see what}} a perfect {{performance}} it is, all the spots joining {{as if they had}} never been rent. I never was so proud of anything as of my mending capabilities. Besides, I have not been doing it all the time: this naughty little Fanny was in such a laughing mood, that she would neither sleep herself nor let the rest do so; and Kitty rose up out of <b>her</b> <b>crib,</b> and lectured us all. Now, don't wake them--no, you must not even kiss the twin cherries; for if they have one of papa's riots, they will hardly sleep all night.' ...|$|E
60|$|The smoke {{here was}} not too dense to prevent his seeing. One glance {{revealed}} baby Frog lying calmly in <b>her</b> <b>crib</b> as if asleep. To seize her, wrap her in the blankets, and carry {{her to the door}} of the room, was the work of a moment, but the awful abyss now lay before him, and it seemed to have been heated seven times. The beam, too, was by that time re-kindling with the increased heat, and the burden he carried prevented Giles from seeing, and balancing himself so well. He did not hesitate, but he advanced slowly and with caution.|$|E
6000|$|The longing of her {{childhood}} filled her soul again. The desire which many a night had kept her awake in <b>her</b> <b>crib,</b> and which fear of its fallacy had of late years almost extinguished, relit suddenly, and glowed warm in her heart, that her mother might come some happy day, and send for her to her presence, look upon her fondly with loving eyes, and say to her tenderly, in a sweet voice, [...] "Caroline, my child, I have a home for you; you shall live with me. All the love you have needed, and not tasted, from infancy, I have saved for you carefully. Come; it shall cherish you now." ...|$|E
5000|$|Sugie - Sugie is Shaggy's {{baby sister}} with her name being {{pronounced}} [...] "shoogy". She only appeared in two episodes. She seems to eat {{as much as}} Shaggy and starts crying when she's apart from her brother. She is Shaggy's favorite [...] "non puppy person" [...] in the world. She has a baby bag which contains her favorite boulder, a <b>crib,</b> <b>her</b> string collection, a refrigerator containing her baby food among various other items. Sugie appeared in The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show episode Wedding Bell Boos as the bride-to-be in 1983, using her given name of Maggie Rogers.|$|R
25|$|Upon moving, Genie's father {{increasingly}} confined Genie to {{the second}} bedroom {{in the back of}} the house while the rest of the family slept in the living room. During the daytime, for approximately 13 hours Genie's father tied her to a child's toilet in a makeshift harness designed to function as a straitjacket. While in the harness, she wore only diapers and could only move her extremities. At night he usually tied her into a sleeping bag and placed <b>her</b> in a <b>crib</b> with a metal-screen cover, keeping her arms and legs immobilized, and researchers believed that he sometimes left her on the child's toilet overnight.|$|R
5|$|Ellen tells Mulder {{that she}} saw a {{reflection}} in the mirror earlier, and that's what killed Martha. Mulder believes the glass are doorways to a demonic dimension and that someone is summoning forth a demon to attack people. Ellen believes Jenny Uphouse summoned the spirits, but she denies it. Later, Ellen finds a skeleton key in her house and a raven by <b>her</b> baby's <b>crib.</b> In a mirror, Ellen sees the reflection of a monster chasing after her, but it suddenly breaks. She hides in the closet until Phil comes home and finds her. However, he attributes the commotion to stress, believing that she is imagining things. Mulder finds the skeleton key and it matches one found in Martha Crittendon's coat pocket. Mulder deduces that the sheriff is having an affair with Jenny. Mulder later tells him that Martha was pregnant and that he thinks he is the father. The sheriff reveals that the key opened the door to a motel, where he and Jenny met for clandestine affairs. Meanwhile, at the motel, Jenny sees ravens outside and is promptly attacked and killed by the creature.|$|R
6000|$|Dr. John {{sat in a}} {{chair at}} Georgette's bedside; Madame stood before him; the little patient had been {{examined}} and soothed, and now lay composed in <b>her</b> <b>crib.</b> Madame Beck, as I entered, was discussing the physician's own health, remarking on some real or fancied change in his looks, charging him with over-work, and recommending rest and change of air. He listened good-naturedly, but with laughing indifference, telling her that she was [...] "trop bonne," [...] and that he felt perfectly well. Madame appealed to me--Dr. John following her movement with a slow glance which seemed to express languid surprise at reference being made to a quarter so insignificant.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{what did}} he say?" [...] And then, in the {{presence}} of Violet, Phineas gave the message. He thought it better that it should be given; and were he to decline to deliver it now, it would never be given. [...] "Whether there be law in the land to protect me or whether there be none, I will never live with him," [...] said Lady Laura. [...] "Is a woman like a head of cattle, that she can be fastened in <b>her</b> <b>crib</b> by force? I will never live with him though all the judges of the land should decide that I must do so." ...|$|E
60|$|Annie {{knew from}} {{the light in the}} kitchen window that Mrs. Bolton, who had not gone to the meeting, was there, and she {{inferred}} from the silence of the house that Bolton had not yet come home. She went up to her room, and after a glance at Idella asleep in <b>her</b> <b>crib,</b> she began to lay off her things. Then she sat down provisionally by the open window, and looked out into the still autumnal night. The air was soft and humid, with a scent of smoke in it from remote forest fires. The village lights showed themselves dimmed by the haze that thickened the moonless dark.|$|E
60|$|It is, perhaps, {{scarcely}} {{necessary to}} add that a full explanation ensued when the party became calmer; that Mrs Twitter could not doubt the veracity of Hetty Frog, but suspected her sanity; that Mrs Frog was sent for, and was recognised at once by Mr Twitter as the poor woman who had asked him such wild and unmeaning questions the night on which {{he had found the}} baby; and that Mr and Mrs Twitter, Mrs Loper, Mrs Larrabel, and Crackaby came to the unanimous conclusion that they had never heard of such a thing before in the whole course of their united lives--which lives, when united, as some statisticians would take a pride in recording, formed two hundred and forty-three years! Poor Mrs Twitter was as inconsolable at the loss of her baby as Mrs Frog was overjoyed at the recovery of hers. She therefore besought the latter to leave little Mita, alias Matty, with her just for one night longer-- only one night--and then she might come for her in the morning, for, you know, it would have been cruel to remove the child from <b>her</b> warm <b>crib</b> at that hour to a cold and comfortless lodging.|$|R

60|$|He was an enthusiast, and {{therefore}} happy, whom I {{have seen in}} the Humanity class-room on an examination day, his pen racing with time, himself seated in the contents of an ink bottle. Some stories of exams. have even a blacker ending. I write in tears of him who, estimating his memory as a leaky vessel, did with care and forethought draw up a crib that was more condensed than a pocket cyclopædia, a very Liebig's essence of the classics, tinned meat for students in the eleventh hour. Bridegrooms have been known to forget the ring; this student forgot his crib. In the middle of the examination came a nervous knocking at the door. A lady wanted to see the professor at once. The student looked up, to see his mother handing the professor his <b>crib.</b> <b>Her</b> son had forgotten it; she was sure that it was important, so she had brought it herself.|$|R
