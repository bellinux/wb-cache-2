5|$|BBRC reviews 1200 to 1500 records {{each year}} (when {{it was first}} set up, the figure was around 200 per year). Of these, {{approximately}} 85% are accepted: this acceptance rate has remained steady for many years. Species that have caused particular problems include black kite, great snipe, <b>gyrfalcon,</b> gull-billed tern, and North Atlantic little shearwater. Peter Grant estimated that, during his tenure as chairman, approximately 2% of accepted records are incorrectly accepted, and 5% are incorrectly rejected.|$|E
5|$|Pintail nests and chicks are {{vulnerable}} to predation by mammals, such as foxes and badgers, and birds like gulls, crows and magpies. The adults can take flight to escape terrestrial predators, but nesting females in particular may be surprised by large carnivores such as bobcats. Large birds of prey, such as northern goshawks, will take ducks from the ground, and some falcons, including the <b>gyrfalcon,</b> have the speed and power to catch flying birds.|$|E
50|$|In the 12th century AD China, swan-hunting with <b>gyrfalcons</b> (海东青 hǎidōngqīng in Chinese) {{obtained}} from the Jurchen tribes became fashionable among the Khitan nobility. When demand for <b>gyrfalcons</b> exceeded supply, the Liao Emperor imposed a tax payment-in-kind of <b>gyrfalcons</b> on the Jurchen; under the last Liao emperor, tax collectors were entitled {{to use force to}} procure sufficient <b>gyrfalcons.</b> This was one cause of the Jurchen rebellion, whose leader Wányán Āgǔdǎ annihilated the Liao empire in 1125, and established the Jin dynasty in its stead.|$|R
50|$|<b>Gyrfalcons</b> are {{expensive}} to buy, and some owners and breeders keep them secret to avoid theft. They can and often do fly long distances, and falconers may fit a radio-tracker to aid recovery. Wild <b>gyrfalcons</b> {{are not much}} exposed to disease, {{and as a result}} have immune systems that are naive to many avian pathogens found around human environments. As a result, many <b>gyrfalcons</b> taken from the wild quickly die of disease.|$|R

5|$|The {{development}} of captive breeding methods {{has led to}} peregrines being commercially available for falconry use, thus mostly eliminating the need to capture wild birds for support of falconry. The main reason for taking wild peregrines {{at this point is}} to maintain healthy genetic diversity in the breeding lines. Hybrids of peregrines and gyrfalcons are also available that can combine the best features of both species to create what many consider to be the ultimate falconry bird for the taking of larger game such as the sage-grouse. These hybrids combine the greater size, strength, and horizontal speed of the <b>gyrfalcon</b> with the natural propensity to stoop and greater warm weather tolerance of the peregrine.|$|E
5|$|Juvenile robins {{and eggs}} are preyed upon by squirrels, snakes, and some birds, such as blue jays, Steller's jay, common grackles, American crows, and common ravens. Adults are {{primarily}} taken by Accipiter hawks, cats, dogs, and larger snakes (especially rat snakes). They {{may be taken}} by nearly every variety of North American accipitrid, from the smallest, the sharp-shinned hawk, {{to one of the}} two largest, the golden eagle, most every North American falcon from the smallest, the American kestrel, to the largest, the <b>gyrfalcon,</b> and almost all owl species from northern pygmy owls to snowy owls. Overall, 28 raptorial bird species are known to hunt robins. Adult robins are most vulnerable when distracted by breeding activities though may also be attacked on the ground or even in flight. However, when feeding in flocks, the American robin is able to remain vigilant and watch other flock members for reactions to predators.|$|E

40|$|Plumage colour {{variation}} exists among <b>Gyrfalcons</b> throughout their Arctic and sub-Arctic circumpolar distribution, ranging from white through silver and grey to almost black. Although different colour variants coexist within many populations, a few geographical regions, such as northern Greenland, possess a single variant, suggesting that local environments may influence plumage {{colour variation}}. In central-west Greenland (66. 5 – 67. 5 °N), where multiple colour variants exist, white male <b>Gyrfalcons</b> fathered sig-nificantly earlier clutches than grey males. No significant association was observed between female colour and lay date. However, significantly more offspring were pro-duced by {{both male and}} female white <b>Gyrfalcons</b> than by grey variants when controlling for lay date, and silver <b>Gyrfalcons</b> produced an intermediate number of offspring for both sexes. This pattern was further supported by breeding plumage colour pairings. Grey females paired with grey males nested significantly later in the season and produced fewer offspring than those paired with white males, whereas no difference in lay date or offspring number was found between white males paired with white or with grey females. The difference in the number of offspring produced at each nest-site was als...|$|R

500|$|Today, peregrines are {{regularly}} paired in captivity with other {{species such as}} the lanner falcon (F.biarmicus) to produce the [...] "perilanner", a somewhat popular bird in falconry as it combines the peregrine's hunting skill with the lanner's hardiness, or the <b>gyrfalcon</b> to produce large, strikingly coloured birds {{for the use of}} falconers. As can be seen, the peregrine is still genetically close to the hierofalcons, though their lineages diverged in the Late Pliocene (maybe some 2.5–2mya in the Gelasian).|$|E
500|$|Due to its {{striking}} hunting technique, the peregrine {{has often}} been associated with aggression and martial prowess. Native Americans of the Mississippian culture (c. 800–1500) used the peregrine, along with several other birds of prey, in imagery {{as a symbol of}} [...] "aerial (celestial) power" [...] and buried men of high status in costumes associating to the ferocity of [...] "raptorial" [...] birds. In the late Middle Ages, the Western European nobility that used peregrines for hunting, considered the bird associated with princes in formal hierarchies of birds of prey, just below the <b>gyrfalcon</b> associated with kings. It was considered [...] "a royal bird, more armed by its courage than its claws". Terminology used by peregrine breeders also used the Old French term gentil, [...] "of noble birth; aristocratic", particularly with the peregrine.|$|E

The legend says that Álmos's mother, already pregnant with him, dreamed of a bird of prey [...] "which had the likeness of a hawk" [...] impregnating her. Historians Gyula Kristó and Victor Spinei wrote that this story, which has close analogies in Turkic folklore, initially narrated the origin of Álmos's family from a totemic ancestor.|$|E

40|$|Little {{information}} {{exists on}} the movements of <b>Gyrfalcons</b> Falco rusticolus outside the breeding season, particularly amongst High Arctic populations, with almost all current knowledge based on Low Arctic populations. This study {{is the first to}} provide data on summer and winter ranges and migration distances. We highlight a behaviour previously unknown in <b>Gyrfalcons,</b> in which birds winter on sea ice far from land. During 2000 – 2004, data were collected from 48 <b>Gyrfalcons</b> tagged with satellite transmitters in three parts of Greenland: Thule (northwest), Kangerlussuaq (central-west) and Scoresbysund (central-east). Breeding home-range size for seven adult females varied from 140 to 1197 km 2 and was 489 and 503 km 2 for two adult males. Complete outward migrations from breeding to wintering areas were recorded for three individuals: an adult male which travelled 3137 km over a 38 -day period (83 km ⁄day) from northern Ellesmere Island to southern Greenland, an adult female which travelled 4234 km from Thule to southern Greenland (via eastern Canada) over an 83 -day period (51 km ⁄day), and an adult female which travelled 391 km from Kangerlussuaq to southern Greenland over a 13 -day period (30 km ⁄day).

Peregrine and prairie falcons have been observed breeding in the wild and have produced offspring. [...] These pairings are thought to be rare, however extra-pair copulations between closely related species may occur more frequently and/or account for most natural occurring hybridization. [...] Some male first generation hybrids may have viable sperm, whereas very few first generation female hybrids lay fertile eggs. [...] Thus, naturally occurring hybridization is thought to be somewhat insignificant to gene flow in raptor species.|$|E
2500|$|Captively bred hybrid falcons {{have been}} {{available}} since the late 1970s, and enjoyed a meteoric rise in popularity in North America and the UK in the 1990s. Hybrids were initially [...] "created" [...] to combine the horizontal speed {{and size of the}} <b>gyrfalcon</b> with the good disposition and aerial ability of the peregrine. [...] Hybrid falcons first gained large popularity throughout the Arabian Peninsula, feeding a demand for particularly large and aggressive female falcons capable and willing to take on the very large houbara bustard, the classic falconry quarry in the deserts of the Middle East. [...] These falcons were also very popular with Arab falconers as they tended to withstand a respiratory disease (aspergillosis from the mold strain aspergillus) in stressful desert conditions better than other pure species from the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E
2500|$|The genus Falco {{is found}} {{worldwide}} and has occupied a central niche in {{ancient and modern}} falconry. [...] Most falcon species used in falconry are specialized predators, most adapted to capturing bird prey such as the peregrine falcon and merlin. [...] A notable exception {{is the use of}} desert falcons such the saker falcon in ancient and modern Middle Eastern and Asian falconry, where hares were and are commonly taken. In North America, the prairie falcon and the <b>gyrfalcon</b> can capture small mammal prey (as well as gamebirds and waterfowl) in falconry, but this is rarely practiced. [...] Young falconers often begin practicing the art with American kestrels, the smallest of the falcons in North America; there is debate on whether this practice should continue. Small species, such as kestrels, merlins and hobbys can also be used for recreational bug hawking – that is, hunting large flying insects such as dragonflies and moths.|$|E

50|$|In {{the medieval}} era, the <b>gyrfalcon</b> was {{considered}} a royal bird. The geographer and historian Ibn Sa'id al-Maghribi (d. 1286) described certain northern Atlantic islands west of Ireland where these falcons would be brought from, and how the Egyptian Sultan paid 1,000 dinars for each <b>gyrfalcon</b> (or, if it arrived dead, 500 dinars). Due to its rarity and the difficulties involved in obtaining it, in European falconry the <b>gyrfalcon</b> was reserved for kings and nobles; very rarely {{was a man of}} lesser rank seen with a <b>gyrfalcon</b> on his fist.|$|E
50|$|Wildlife of the Noatak tundra {{includes}} moose, grizzly bears, black bears, wolves, Arctic foxes, lemmings, Dall's sheep, vast {{herds of}} caribou numbering more than 230,000 individuals, {{and a variety}} of birds.

Predatory birds include rough-legged hawks, <b>gyrfalcons</b> and golden eagles.|$|R
50|$|The Altai breeds in a {{relatively}} small area of Central Asia across the Altai and Sayan Mountains. This area overlaps with the much larger breeding area of the saker falcon (Falco cherrug). It appears that Altai falcons are either natural hybrids between sakers and <b>gyrfalcons</b> (Falco rusticolus), or rather the descendants of such rare hybrids back-crossing into the large population of sakers.|$|R
50|$|Some {{correlation}} {{exists between}} locality and colour morph. Greenland <b>gyrfalcons</b> are lightest, with white plumage flecked with grey {{on the back}} and wings being most common. Other subpopulations have varying amounts of the darker morphs: the Icelandic birds tend towards pale, whereas the Eurasian populations are considerably darker and typically incorporate no white birds. Natural separation into regional subspecies is prevented by gyrfalcons' habit of flying long distances whilst exchanging alleles between subpopulations; thus, the allele distributions for the color polymorphism form clines and in darker birds of unknown origin, theoretically any allele combination might be present. For instance, a mating of a pair of captive <b>gyrfalcons</b> is documented to have produced a clutch of four young: one white, one silver, one brown, and one black. Molecular work suggests plumage color is associated with the melanocortin 1 receptor gene (MC1R), where a nonsynonymous point substitution was perfectly associated with the white/melanic polymorphism.|$|R
