Isaac's commissions had been purchased with a loan entered into the bank's books by his brother, and the Brocks faced a demand for payment. Isaac could not meet the £3000 debt, but made over the whole of his salary to his brother Irving, to be used <b>for</b> <b>whatever</b> was considered most critical: his commission debt or the family's other bills.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1950, the National Hurricane Center named officially {{recognized}} tropical {{storms and}} hurricanes. The unnamed hurricane {{was reported to}} have met all the criteria for a tropical cyclone, but it was purposefully left unnamed. This was done to avoid confusion among the media and the public, who were focusing on the damage from the initial nor'easter, as the hurricane itself was not expected to pose a major threat to land. It was the eighth nameable storm of the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season. Had the system been named <b>for</b> <b>whatever</b> reason, it would've received the name Henri, which was the next name on the 1991 list after Grace.|$|E

5|$|At {{this crucial}} juncture, Abe chose {{to abandon the}} mission and depart the area. Several reasons are conjectured {{as to why he}} made this decision. Much of the special {{bombardment}} ammunition had been expended in the battle. If the bombardment failed to destroy the airfield, then his warships would be vulnerable to CAF air attack at dawn. His own injuries and the deaths of some of his staff from battle action may have affected Abe's judgement. Perhaps he was also unsure as to how many of his or the U.S. ships were still combat-capable because of communication problems with the damaged Hiei. Furthermore, his own ships were scattered and would have taken some time to reassemble for a coordinated resumption of the mission to attack Henderson Field and the remnants of the U.S. warship force. <b>For</b> <b>whatever</b> reason, Abe called for a disengagement and general retreat of his warships, although Yukikaze and Teruzuki remained behind to assist Hiei. Samidare picked up survivors from Yūdachi at 03:00 before joining the other Japanese ships in the retirement northwards.|$|E
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>whatever</b> reason, Ealdred {{gave up the}} see of Worcester in 1062, when papal legates {{arrived in}} England to hold a council {{and make sure that}} Ealdred relinquished Worcester. This {{happened}} at Easter in 1062. Ealdred was succeeded by Wulfstan, chosen by Ealdred, but John of Worcester relates that Ealdred had a hard time deciding between Wulfstan and Æthelwig. The legates had urged the selection of Wulfstan because of his saintliness. Because the position of Stigand, the archbishop of Canterbury, was irregular, Wulfstan sought and received consecration as a bishop from Ealdred. Normally, Wulfstan would have gone to the archbishop of Canterbury, as the see of Worcester was within Canterbury's province. Although Ealdred gave up the bishopric, the appointment of Wulfstan was one that allowed Ealdred to continue his considerable influence on the see of Worcester. Ealdred retained a number of estates belonging to Worcester. Even after the Norman Conquest, Ealdred still controlled some events in Worcester, and it was Ealdred, not Wulfstan, who opposed Urse d'Abetot's attempt to extend the castle of Worcester into the cathedral after the Norman Conquest.|$|E

5|$|From January 1918 to January 1921 Poulenc was a conscript in the French Army in {{the last}} months of the First World War and the {{immediate}} post-war period. Between July and October 1918 he served at the Franco-German front, after which he was given a series of auxiliary posts, ending as a typist at the Ministry of Aviation. His duties allowed him time for composition; the Trois mouvements perpétuels for piano and the Sonata for Piano Duet were written at the piano of the local elementary school at Saint-Martin-sur-le-Pré, and he completed his first song cycle, Le bestiaire, setting poems by Apollinaire. The sonata did not create a deep public impression, but the song cycle made the composer's name known in France, and the Trois mouvements perpétuels rapidly became an international success. The exigencies of music-making in wartime taught Poulenc much about writing <b>for</b> <b>whatever</b> instruments were available; then, and later, some of his works were for unusual combinations of players.|$|E
5|$|Some large {{primates}} such as gorillas and orang-utans (and also humans) have undeveloped ear {{muscles that}} are non-functional vestigial structures, yet are still {{large enough to}} be easily identified. An ear muscle that cannot move the ear, <b>for</b> <b>whatever</b> reason, has lost that biological function. This serves as evidence of homology between related species. In humans, there is variability in these muscles, such that some people are able to move their ears in various directions, and {{it has been said that}} it may be possible for others to gain such movement by repeated trials. In such primates, the inability to move the ear is compensated for mainly by the ability to easily turn the head on a horizontal plane, an ability which is not common to most monkeys—a function once provided by one structure is now replaced by another.|$|E
5|$|The Belgian Army was {{stretched}} from Cadzand south to Menen {{on the river}} Leie, and west, from Menin, to Bruges without any sort of reserves. With {{the exception of a}} few RAF sorties, the air was exclusively under the control of the Luftwaffe, and the Belgians reported attacks against all targets considered an objective, with resulting casualties. No natural obstacles remained between the Belgians and the German Army; retreat was not feasible. The Luftwaffe had destroyed most of the rail networks to Dunkirk, just three roads were left: Bruges–Torhout–Dixmude, Bruges–Ghistelles–Nieuport and Bruges–Ostend–Nieuport. Using such axes of retreat was impossible without losses owing to German air supremacy (as opposed to air superiority). Water supplies were damaged and cut off, gas and electricity supplies were also cut. Canals were drained and used as supply dumps <b>for</b> <b>whatever</b> ammunition and food-stuffs were left. The total remaining area covered just 1,700km², and compacted military and civilians alike, of which the latter numbered some 3 million people. Under these circumstances Leopold deemed further resistance useless. On the evening of 27 May, he requested an armistice.|$|E

5|$|The book {{consists}} of twelve chapters, plus an Epilogue and an Acknowledgements section at the end. Smith and MacKinnon individually write alternating chapters, {{each of which}} covers one month from March 2005 to February 2006. In the first chapter MacKinnon tells how his idea for the 100-mile diet began and Smith agrees to try it for one year. They begin symbolically {{on the first day}} of Spring, March 21, and define 'local' as 100 miles, a convenient radius that would include the Lower Mainland, the southern half of Vancouver Island, and Whatcom County and Skagit County in Washington State. Their exceptions to this rule include meals eaten while traveling, meals prepared by friends, and business lunches. Their initial month was expensive as they scoured grocery stores <b>for</b> <b>whatever</b> they could find. In the second chapter, Smith describes her and MacKinnon as an unwed urban couple in their early thirties with no children and living in a rented apartment. They recount how eating impacted their relationship before and after the diet, the anonymity of prepackaged foods, the traceability of their diet, and the diets of the Coast Salish.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of express trusts in English law must involve four elements for the trust to be valid: capacity, certainty, constitution and formality. Capacity {{refers to the}} settlor's ability to create a trust in the first place; generally speaking, anyone capable of holding property can create a trust. There are exceptions for statutory bodies and corporations, and minors who usually cannot hold property can, in some circumstances, create trusts. Certainty refers to the three certainties required for a trust to be valid. The trust instrument must show certainty of intention to create a trust, certainty of what {{the subject matter of}} the trust is, and certainty of who the beneficiaries (or objects) are. Where there is uncertainty <b>for</b> <b>whatever</b> reason, the trust will fail, although the courts have developed ways around this. Constitution means that for the trust to be valid, the property must have been transferred from the settlor to the trustees.|$|E
5|$|The cy-près {{doctrine}} {{is the idea}} that, where a charitable trust's purposes are impossible or cannot be fulfilled <b>for</b> <b>whatever</b> reason, the funds should be reapplied to purposes {{as close as possible}} to the trust's original goals. This is done through a formal application by the trustees, either to the High Court of Justice or the Charity Commission. This doctrine originated in ecclesiastical law, the name coming as a contraction of the Norman French cy près comme possible (as close as possible), It was originally justified in an ecclesiastical way; charitable gifts were provided to secure entry into heaven, and if the charitable gift failed, this would not be guaranteed. If it was re-purposed, however, entry would be granted. The local bishop, therefore, would usually simply apply the gift to the nearest possible purpose to the testator's original goals.|$|E

5|$|When {{a colony}} is dying, <b>for</b> <b>whatever</b> cause, and other healthy colonies are nearby (as is typical in a bee yard), those healthy colonies often enter the dying colony and rob its {{provisions}} {{for their own}} use. If the dying colony's provisions were contaminated (by natural or man-made toxins), the resulting pattern (of healthy colonies becoming sick when in proximity to a dying colony) might suggest to an observer that a contagious disease is involved. However, it is typical in CCD cases that provisions of dying colonies are not being robbed, suggesting that at least this particular mechanism (toxins being spread via robbing, thereby mimicking a disease) {{is not involved in}} CCD. Additional evidence that CCD is an infectious disease came from the following observations: the hives of colonies that had died from CCD could be reused with a healthy colony only if they were first treated with DNA-destroying radiation, and the CCD Working Group report in 2010 indicated that CCD-exhibiting hives tended to occur in proximity to one another within apiaries.|$|E
5|$|Beebe {{continued}} to conduct marine research after 1934, {{but he felt}} that he had seen what he wanted to see using the Bathysphere, and that further dives were too expensive <b>for</b> <b>whatever</b> knowledge he gained from them to be worth the cost. With the help of Beebe's friend the physician Henry Lloyd, Beebe conducted an expedition in the West Indies examining the stomach contents of tuna, which uncovered previously unknown larval forms of several species of fish. Shortly after returning, Beebe set out on a longer expedition to the waters around Baja California, financed by the Californian businessman Templeton Crocker on board his yacht the Zaca. The goal of this expedition was to study the area's undersea fauna by means of dredging and helmet diving, and Beebe and his team were surprised by the diversity of animals that they encountered there. In 1937 Beebe went on a second expedition aboard the Zaca, documenting the native wildlife along the Pacific Coast from Mexico to Colombia. During this expedition, rather than focusing on either sea animals as he had at Nonsuch Island or on birds as he had earlier in his life, he attempted to document all aspects of the ecosystem. Beebe described his two expeditions on board the Zaca in his books Zaca Venture and The Book of Bays, in which he emphasized his concern for threatened habitats and his dismay at human destruction.|$|E
5|$|In late 1933-early 1934, a major strain {{was placed}} on German-Japanese {{relations}} when the German ambassador to Japan, when Ambassador Herbert von Dirksen appointed Ferdinand Heye, a Nazi Party member and a disreputable German businessman convicted by a Chinese court of opium smuggling in 1927 the Special German Trade Commissioner for Manchukuo. The Japanese attached much importance {{to the question of}} recognizing Manchukuo, which was seen as a litmus test <b>for</b> <b>whatever</b> one was a true friend of Japan or of China. Heye attempted with the support of Dirksen to have the Japanese give him a monopoly of exporting soybeans from Manchukuo, in exchange for which he promised to have Germany recognize Manchukuo. The ambitious Heye, having won the friendship of the Kwantung Army by promising that he would have the Reich recognize Manchukuo, then attempted to use his position as German Trade Commissioner to Manchukuo to secure a monopoly on all German investments in Manchukuo. The attempts of Heye and Dirksen to have Germany recognize Manchukuo involved them in a dispute with Neurath who preferred to keep Germany's special relationship it had established with the Kuomintang regime in China going, and who knew well that the Chinese would be extremely offended if Germany recognized Manchukuo. The Heye affair caused much bad feelings on both sides, and was ended in February 1935 with the victory of Neurath when Hitler disallowed Heye and his promises he made.|$|E
