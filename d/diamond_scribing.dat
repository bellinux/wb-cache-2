One {{of the consequences of}} <b>diamond</b> <b>scribing</b> sintered conductor material to remove shorts is the introduction of surface flaws in the alumina substrate. A small flaw can ultimately lead to substantial stress concentrations which result in reduced substrate strength. There is very little supporting performance data for this short removal process. How much is the flexure strength of a substrate degraded when filaments of conductor material are removed using a diamond scribe? An analysis was performed on a complex government application to determine how much a diamond scribe network had compromised the mechanical integrity of the substrate...|$|E
40|$|Crystalline silicon (Si) wafers used as {{substrates}} in {{the semiconductor}} and photovoltaic (PV) industries are traditionally manufactured using a multi-wire slurry sawing (MWSS) technique. Due to its high productivity potential, the fixed abrasive diamond wire sawing (DWS) technique is of considerable interest to Si wafer producers. Although both sawing techniques are currently {{used in the}} industry, a fundamental understanding of the underlying process is still lacking, particularly for diamond wire sawing. Consequently, optimization of the wire sawing process is carried out largely based on experience and trial and error. This thesis aims to develop a systematic fundamental understanding of diamond wire sawing of Si materials used for PV applications. First of all, a comparative analysis {{of the characteristics of}} silicon wafers cut by slurry and fixed abrasive diamond wire sawing is presented. The analysis results indicate that fixed abrasive diamond wire sawing may be a viable alternative to slurry wire sawing. Modeling and experimental studies of single grit <b>diamond</b> <b>scribing</b> of Si are proposed to shed light on the basic cutting mechanisms. Although Si is brittle at room temperature, it is possible to properly control the cutting conditions to obtain a completely ductile mode of material removal. The effects of material anisotropy, abrasive grit shape, friction condition and external hydrostatic pressure on the ductile-to-brittle mode transition in cutting of single crystal Si (sc-Si) are systematically investigated. Multicrystalline Si (mc-Si) based solar cells take up the majority of the global PV market. Hard inclusions (Silicon carbide and Silicon nitride) in multicrystalline Si (mc-Si) ingots may cause wire breakage and negatively impact the process, surface/subsurface morphology and mechanical properties of the resulting wafer. Their effects are experimentally studied through the single grit <b>diamond</b> <b>scribing</b> on the mc-Si sample with high density of inclusions. Finally, it is identified that there is a correlation between the high dislocation density and the increase of fracture toughness in mc-Si. The increase in fracture toughness leads to greater capability of ductile mode of cutting and higher specific scribing energy in the brittle fracture regime. Results of these fundamental investigations are expected to generate useful knowledge for optimizing the diamond wire sawing process in order to achieve high productivity and minimum surface/subsurface damage.

40|$|Abstract. Strengthening {{of glass}} sheets {{through the process}} of ion {{exchange}} have been widely used in thinner cover glass for smart phone. The compressive stress improves the ability of the glass surface to withstand damage from mechanical impact. However, the presence of the damage resistant layer makes conventional mechanical and laser cutting of the ion-exchanged glass difficult. Normally, the cutting process will lead to spontaneous glass sheet breakage or shattering. Even successful in some samples, the underlying central tension is exposed on the edge, and the mechanical strength and durability of this edge is degraded. The repair of edge cracks becomes an extremely important issue for the development of single glass based smart phone. The ion exchanged glass plates (Corning IOX-FS) with a thickness of 0. 7 mm were selected as the substrate materials. After cutting ion exchanged glass by high penetration <b>diamond</b> <b>scribing</b> wheels, the edge of glass plates can be protected or strengthened with silica sol using roll coating process. It was observed that the strength could be improved achieving 210 % compared to the strength of uncoated glass sheets. The sol-gel coating could improve the strength of the glass mainly by the mechanisms of filling in edge flaws or blunting crack tips. The effects of silica sol and processing parameters of roll coating process on the cracks filling effects were investigated...|$|E

50|$|Synthetic single {{crystals}} of semiconductor {{materials are}} generally sold as thin wafers which are {{much easier to}} cleave. Simply pressing a silicon wafer against a soft surface and scratching its edge with a <b>diamond</b> <b>scribe</b> is usually enough to cause cleavage; however, when dicing a wafer to form chips, a procedure of scoring and breaking is often followed for greater control.

40|$|AbstractDie {{separation}} {{processes for}} compound semiconductor devices are typically based on either <b>diamond</b> <b>scribe</b> and break techniques or on ganged sawing of the substrate using water-cooled saws.

40|$|We have {{developed}} simplified microfluidic droplet generators and employed them to fabricate anisotropic polymer particles and capsules {{in the size}} range of 100 – 500 μm. We used cheap and generally available materials and equipment to design and assemble microfluidic devices. All our devices were made of standard wall borosilicate capillaries (OD 1. 0 mm, ID 0. 58 mm), steel dispensing needles without bevel (30 G, 32 G), microscopy glass slides, fast-curing epoxy glue (Araldite- 80805) and <b>diamond</b> <b>scribe</b> to process the glass. We designed four different geometries for each device, which can be separated for two groups: single and double droplet generators.

The range of the fabricated particles and capsules includes anisotropically-shaped amphiphilic polymer “microbuckets”, biphasic particles, capsules with various fillers and stimuli responsive polymer vesicles. To produce such objects we employed different functional monomers, for instance “clickable” glycidyl methacrylate or hydrophilic 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate. We also utilized several chemical and physical phenomena such as internal phase separation, wettability or polymer chain cross-linking to tune the properties of the synthesized particles.

40|$|Clad and unclad 2024 -T 351 {{aluminium}} alloy sheets, weakened by mechanically machined scratches, were fatigued {{to investigate the}} effect of small surface damage, like scribe marks, on aircraft fuselage joints. The role of scratch cross section geometry on fatigue life of scribed components was analysed. Scratches between 25 and 185 [*]µm deep, with 5, 25 and 50 [*]µm root radii, were cut on sample surface by using diamond-tipped tools. After testing, fracture surfaces were examined using a scanning electron microscope, and crack growth rates were measured by striation counting. Scratches reduced aluminium fatigue life under tensile and bending load up to 97. 8 % due to multiple crack nucleation at their roots. Short cracks nucleated from sharp scratches coalesced to form unique elongated cracks growing through sample thickness. Cracks initiated from scratches were typical short cracks, growing faster than conventional long cracks.

40|$|Motivation During {{research}} and development regarding next generation solar cells, many experiments are performed on multi-crystalline silicon (Si) wafers. One regular task is the separation of different areas of interest on a Si wafer. Separating multi-crystalline Si wafers implies one major challenge: Breaking the samples manually leads most often to a heap of Si crumbs which are only useful with limitations afterwards. This paper investigates the applicability of a novel wafer separation method, the thermal laser separation (TLS), on the separation of multi-crystalline Si wafers. TLS has already proven its applicability in the dicing of mono-crystalline Si wafers [1]. For the dicing of multi-crystalline Si, TLS will be compared to manual scribe and break and the mechanical wafer saw. E ach method is applied to wire saw cut multi-crystalline Si wafers. The methods are briefly described, experimental results are compared {{with each other and}} the separation methods are evaluated. Approach Samples of wire saw cut Si wafers (156 mm x 156 mm) are used to evaluate three separation methods. Each sample should be separated into squares of 20 mm edge length. For the sample preparation an accuracy of ap-prox. 100 μm in straightness is sufficient. The following separation methods are evaluated: Scribe and break: An initial scribe is applied manually {{at the edge of the}} samples with a diamond tip. The sam-ples are then broken manually by bending both sides of the sample around this initial scribe with tweezers. Mechanical wafer saw: Fast rotating (30. 000 rpm) diamond blades ar e used to separate the Si wafers by remov-ing material of the size of the blade width. Thermal Laser Separation [1]: The TLS process is a cleaving process that uses thermal-induced mechanical stress and which comprises two steps. To initiate the process, a small initial scribe is required, which is done with a diamond tool tip or with a special scribing laser (step 1). In this case, a diamond tool tip is used. The initial scribe gives the cleaving process a well-defined starting point. During the cleaving step (step 2), the material is heated up by a laser and directly after the laser spot the material is cooled down by a water aerosol. This combi-nation of heating up and cooling down the material results in a large temperature gradient inducing tensile stress inside the material. The ten sile stress opens a crack starting from the initial scribe and the crack is guided through the material by the movement of the laser-cooling combination. Sample preparation For the scribe and break no special preparation is necessary. As the mechanical wafer saw is a typical dicing technology, it is necessary to mount the wafers on dicing tape which has a sticky layer that holds the Si wafer on a thin metal dicing frame. In this case a UV tape is used. This tapes adhesiveness can be reduced by UV irradiating the tape after the dicing process. Separated samples can then be demounted manually. Even though the TLS-technology works also normally with dicing tape, it is not necessary to use it due to the fact that no external mechanical stress is applied to the samples compared to the mechan ical wafer saw. That is why the samples are just put on a vacuum chuck without special additional preparation. Results Results of separating multi-crystalline Si samples are shown in the figures below: Scribe and break (Figure 1) : The small arrows denote the manually applied <b>diamond</b> <b>scribes.</b> As can be seen from Figure 1 it is impossible to separate the samples into rectangular pieces. This process result does not fulfill the above specifications. Mechanical wafer saw (Figure 2) : With the mechanical saw it is possible to separate the samples into the speci-fied rectangular pieces with good straightness. Major drawback is the time-consuming sample preparation be-cause of the need for the mounting process prior to the separation and the demounting process after the separa-tion. Chipping a t the sample edges (indicated by the arrows) might reduce the breaking strength of the samples (currently under investigation). Thermal Laser Separation (Figure 3) : The TLS-process results also in rectangular pieces, but of lower straight-ness as the saw-result; compare arrow in Figure 3 (quantitative analysis ongoing). The TLS-process is less time-consuming, because no special preparation is necessary and the separation process works at high velocities up to 300 mm/s (wafer saw 10 mm/s in this case). Conclusion It was shown that for the preparation of multi-crystalline Si wafers as envisaged here, the TLS-technology pro-vides the fastest results with low preparation effort and, compared to the mechanical wafer saw, with a sufficient straightness. Investigations on the resulting bending strength and a quantitative analysis of the achieved straightness are being continued and will be presented in the final paper...|$|R
40|$|III-V {{compound}} semiconductors possess advantageous materials properties, such as direct bandgap and high carrier mobility, which make them attractive in optoelectronic, fiber optical communications and high-speed digital circuit applications. Integration of III-V heterostructures using direct wafer bonding has the {{added benefit of}} avoiding constraints in lattice parameter mismatch compared to epitaxially grown devices. As a result, wafer bonding is significant in its ability to integrate mismatched materials and circumvent the issues of inferior device performance due to a high density of threading dislocations. In the solar industry, off-axis substrates are commonly used in the growth of III-V epitaxial layers to avoid the formation of antiphase boundaries, which act as deep level non-radiative recombination centers. Previously published studies from our research group showed that an additional sulfur-based passivation technique can reduce the density of surface charge states and improve the conductivity across the interface. However, a research topic that has not been investigated is the effect that miscut substrates have on the performance of direct-bonded III-V devices. In this study, the effect of the wafer offcut angle on the electrical conductivity of III-V solar cell devices is investigated using n-GaAs/n-GaAs wafer-bonded structures. GaAs (001) wafers misoriented towards A are chosen and compared to nominal on-axis substrates. Prior to bonding, the surfaces are treated with either an oxide etch or additional 5 -min treatment in aqueous (NH 4) 2 S. Off-axis wafers are positioned face-to-face with a non-zero relative surface misorientation between the tilted (001) planes and low force bonding is initiated at room temperature. The highest degree of misorientation in this study is produced using 6 ° off-axis wafers and can be represented as a grain boundary with a twin defect at the (1 1 13) plane and a tilt angle of 12 ° about the common [110] direction. The samples are annealed at 400 °C for two hours to strengthen the bond. It is observed that the electrical conductivity improves considerably with a short rapid thermal processing (RTP) at 600 °C for 2 mins. However, the degree of miscut has a detrimental effect, as both the oxide-etched and sulfur-treated samples exhibit increasingly non-ohmic behavior with greater relative misorientations. A theoretical model that describes the electron tunneling across a grain boundary between semiconductor bicrystals is used to represent the bonded interface and estimate the barrier conduction height. Fitting the zero-bias conductance data over a range of temperatures reveals an increased barrier height for greater offcut angles, with 4 ° and 6 ° miscut sulfur-passivated wafers producing a 0. 4 eV increase. When compared to on-axis structures, the interface resistance at room temperature increases from 0. 01 ohm·cm 2 to 3. 4 ohm·cm 2. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) are used to compare the interface morphology across the range of relative misorientations after the 600 °C RTP. The ratio of well-bonded crystalline regions to amorphous oxide inclusions is consistent across all bonded samples, indicating that the degree of misorientation does not affect the level of interface recrystallization. It is also observed that regions adjacent to the interface undergo a process of atomic redistribution and recrystallize into the same lattice arrangement as the bulk semiconductor. The effect of relative surface misorientation on conductivity is further investigated by fabricating zero-degree relative (001) misoriented bonded samples using 6 ° miscut substrates and subjecting to the same thermal and sulfur passivation treatment. This can be described as a grain boundary at the (1 1 13) plane without any twin defects about the [110] direction. Current-voltage (I-V) characteristics are comparable to nominal on-axis specimen with the interface resistance measured as 0. 02 ohm·cm 2. It is concluded that the degree of relative misorientation of (001) planes across the bonded interface has {{a significant impact on the}} electrical properties, as illustrated by the two orders of magnitude difference in conductance. Non-ohmic behavior has previously been discovered in direct-bonded n-type GaAs/GaAs structures. In order to pinpoint the source of this inferior conductance, several lines are physically cut into the surface with a <b>diamond</b> <b>scribe</b> to electrically isolate a portion of the metal contacts. I-V measurements are taken at various test points to compare the resistance across the different interfaces. The measured resistance across the metal-metal and metal-semiconductor-metal regions is found to be 0. 8 ohms. However, the inclusion of the bonded interface results in a significant increase in resistance to 770 ohms at zero-bias conditions. The non-ohmic behavior is confirmed to be solely attributed to the bonded interface. These results demonstrate the potential usefulness of using off-axis substrates in the fabrication of direct wafer-bonded III-V heterostructures. More importantly, the primary effect on conductivity does not originate from the miscut substrates themselves. Instead, the out-of-plane relative misorientation of the tilted (001) planes is the critical parameter that needs to be controlled within a manufacturing environment in order to achieve acceptable electrical performance in multijunction solar applications...|$|R
