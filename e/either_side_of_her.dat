5|$|One male, or {{sometimes}} several, will pursue a female. When {{one of the}} males approaches the female, he uses his upper jaw to grab her dorsum. The male will then roll the female over by grabbing one of her pectoral fins, which are located on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> body. Once he is on her ventral side, the male puts a clasper into the female, connecting them venter to venter, with both undersides together. The mating process lasts for 30–90 seconds.|$|E
25|$|A {{room on the}} {{northeast}} corner of {{the third floor of the}} Arsenal was made into a courtroom, and the prisoners were brought into the room through a side door, which prevented them from passing by or being harassed by spectators. Surratt was given special considerations during the trial because of her illness and gender. In the courtroom, she sat apart from the other prisoners. Sources differ as to whether an armed guard sat on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> like for other prisoners during the trial. While the others wore wrist and ankle manacles in the courtroom, she did not. She was also permitted a bonnet, fan, and veil to hide her face from spectators. As her illness worsened during the trial, she was moved to a larger and more comfortable prison cell.|$|E
25|$|In {{the centre}} panel, Mary {{is shown in}} a red robe holding the Christ's lifeless long body. Saint Peter and Luke the Evangelist stand on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> Both are dressed in black clothes, and represent, the {{foundation}} of the early Church and the Gospels, respectively. The right-hand panel shows the moment (not in any of the Gospels) when Christ appears to his mother after his Resurrection, which is repeated at a smaller scale in the distance through the open doorway at rear. Although van der Weyden had otherwise presented the chronology of the triptych from left to right, the background resurrection is {{to the right of the}} Appearance in the foreground. The sequence is suggested by the picture's depth (in that the scene in the foreground is chronologically the more recent), and by the long winding path that leads from the tomb to the interior.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Gallilee {{was leaning}} back in her chair: her hands hung down on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> her; <b>her</b> eyes looked up drowsily at the ceiling.

500|$|During this time, La Spezia was {{attacked}} many times by Allied bomber groups. Attacks on 14 and 19 April 1943, did not hit Roma, but an American raid on 5 June, severely damaged both Vittorio Veneto and Roma. B-17 aircraft carrying [...] armor-piercing bombs damaged the stationary battleships with two bombs each. Roma suffered from two near hits on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> bow. The starboard-side bomb hit the ship but {{passed through the}} side of the hull before exploding. The ship began taking on water through leaks from frames 221 to 226—an area covering about —and through flooding from the bow to frame 212. The second bomb missed but exploded in the water near the hull. Leaks were discovered over a [...] area ranging from frames 198 and 207. Approximately [...] of water entered the ship.|$|E
500|$|In 1952, for example, {{the court}} {{accepted}} {{the claim of}} the Dean of Westminster to advise the Queen on the proper procedure during the ceremony (for nearly a thousand years he and his predecessor abbots have kept an unpublished Red Book of practices), the claim of the Lord Bishop of Durham and the Lord Bishop of Bath and Wells to walk beside the Queen as she entered and exited the Abbey and to stand on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> through the entire coronation ritual, the claim of the Earl of Shrewsbury {{in his capacity as}} Lord High Steward of Ireland to carry a white staff. The legal claim of the Scholars of Westminster School {{to be the first to}} acclaim the monarch on behalf of the common people was formally disallowed by the court, but in practice their traditional shouts of [...] "Vivat! Vivat Rex!" [...] were still incorporated into the coronation anthem I was glad.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} PADI-trained {{technique is}} for the rescuer to approach the face-down unconscious diver (victim) from above and kneel with one knee <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> his or <b>her</b> diving cylinder. Then, with the victim's diving regulator held in place, the tank is gripped firmly between the knees and the rescuer's buoyancy compensator is used to control a slow ascent to the surface.|$|R
2500|$|On {{the night}} of 8/9 August, a Japanese force of seven cruisers and a {{destroyer}} under Vice Admiral Gunichi Mikawa sneaked by Savo Island and attacked the American ships. At the time, Astoria had been patrolling {{to the east of}} Savo Island in column behind [...] and [...] The Japanese came through the channel to the west of Savo Island and opened fire on Chicago – [...] force first at about 0140 {{on the morning of the}} 9th, hitting both cruisers with torpedoes and shells. They then divided – inadvertently – into two separate groups and turned generally northeast, passing on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Astoria and <b>her</b> two consorts. The enemy cruisers began firing on that force at about 0150, and the heavy cruiser began return fire immediately. She ceased fire briefly because her commanding officer temporarily mistook the Japanese force for friendly ships but soon resumed shooting. Astoria took no hits in the first four Japanese salvoes, but the fifth ripped into her superstructure, turning her into an inferno amidships. In quick succession, enemy shells put her No. 1 turret out of action and started a serious fire in the plane hangar that burned brightly and provided the enemy with a self-illuminated target.|$|R
60|$|There {{were also}} shrill {{commands}} that she halt, but to these she paid no attention. Before she had half circled the enclosure {{she discovered that}} her chances for successful escape were great, since it was evident to her that her pursuers were not so fleet as she. High indeed then were her hopes as she came in sight of the hill, but they were soon dashed by what lay before her, for there, in the fields that lay between, were fully a hundred creatures similar to those behind her and all were on the alert, evidently warned by the whistling of their fellows. Instructions and commands were shouted to and fro, {{with the result that}} those before her spread roughly into a great half circle to intercept her, and when she turned to the right, hoping to elude the net, she saw others coming from fields beyond, and to the left the same was true. But Tara of Helium would not admit defeat. Without once pausing she turned directly {{toward the center of the}} advancing semi-circle, beyond which lay <b>her</b> single chance <b>of</b> escape, and as she ran she drew her long, slim dagger. Like her valiant sire, if die she must, she would die fighting. There were gaps in the thin line confronting her and toward the widest of one of these she directed her course. The things on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the opening guessed her intent for they closed in to place themselves in her path. This widened the openings on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> them and as the girl appeared almost to rush into their arms she turned suddenly at right angles, ran swiftly in the new direction for a few yards, and then dashed quickly toward the hill again. Now only a single warrior, with a wide gap on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> him, barred <b>her</b> clear way to freedom, though all the others were speeding as rapidly as they could to intercept her. If she could pass this one without too much delay she could escape, of that she was certain. Her every hope hinged on this. The creature before her realized it, too, for he moved cautiously, though swiftly, to intercept her, as a Rugby fullback might maneuver in the realization that he alone stood between the opposing team and a touchdown.|$|R

2500|$|The {{painting}} shows a half-length figure, {{the body}} of a woman turned at a three-quarter angle toward her right, but her face turned toward her left. Her gaze is directed neither straight ahead, nor toward the viewer, but toward a [...] "third party" [...] beyond the picture's frame. In her arms, Gallerani holds a small white-coated stoat, known as an ermine. Gallerani's dress is comparatively simple, revealing that she is not a noblewoman. Her coiffure, known as a coazone, confines her hair smoothly to her head with two bands of hair bound on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> face and a long plait at the back. Her hair is held in place by a fine gauze veil with a woven border of gold-wound threads, a black band, and a sheath over the plait.|$|E

30|$|In addition, {{because the}} level set filter not only {{preserves}} edges but also enhances edges by inhibiting diffusion across edges and allowing diffusion on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> edge. So, standard deviation will become large in Table 1. Meanwhile, {{it appears that}} some edges are enhanced, that is, the difference of intensity value on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> edge becomes large (Figure 3 (i)). At a word, black will become more black while white more white on <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> edge.|$|R
