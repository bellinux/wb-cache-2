5|$|The Stranges {{become a}} popular couple in London. Lady Pole and Strange's wife, Arabella, become friends and during one of her visits Arabella meets the gentleman with thistle-down hair, whom she assumes is a relative. The Cabinet ministers find Strange <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> than Norrell, and they send him to assist the Duke of Wellington on his Peninsular Campaign. For over a year, Strange helps the army: he creates roads, moves towns, and makes dead men speak. After he returns, he fails to cure George III's madness, {{although}} Strange manages to save the king from the gentleman with thistle-down hair, who is determined to make Stephen a king. Strange then helps defeat Napoleon at the horrific Battle of Waterloo.|$|E
25|$|They {{arrange the}} work in better form for {{inspection}} and use than do the old pen and ink methods. The printed tabular forms and loose sheet devices are surely <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> than cumbersome books and written columns, which have been used from remote times in the accounts of manufacturing firms.|$|E
25|$|This {{paper is}} also {{remarkable}} {{for the development}} of the idea of the scalar potential. The gravitational force acting on a body is, in modern language, a vector, having magnitude and direction. A potential function is a scalar function that defines how the vectors will behave. A scalar function is computationally and conceptually <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> than a vector function.|$|E

25|$|Emperor Claudius {{fell ill}} {{on the march}} to the battle and {{returned}} to his regional headquarters in Sirmium, leaving Aurelian in charge of operations against the Goths. Aurelian used his cavalry to great effect, breaking the Goths into smaller groups which were <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with.</b> By late summer the Goths were defeated: any survivors were stripped of their animals and booty and were levied into the army or settled as farmers in frontier regions. Aurelian had no time to relish his victories; in late August news arrived from Sirmium that emperor Claudius was dead.|$|E
25|$|The kibbutzim were {{established}} during the pioneer period {{and were the}} fulfilment of the Zionist vision, {{during that period of}} time every member was required to give the maximum from himself for the good of the collective: the kibbutz and the state. In addition, as a group it was <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the common problems of the individuals—which allowed the recruitment of a large number of people for maintaining the safety of the community at that time, and therefore this way of life was suited for the Zionist goals more than other forms of life at that time.|$|E
25|$|Pending a {{thorough}} {{review of the}} Recent and prehistoric cormorants, the single-genus approach is followed here for three reasons: first, it is preferable to tentatively assigning genera without a robust hypothesis. Second, it makes it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the fossil forms, the systematic treatment {{of which has been}} no less controversial than that of living cormorants and shags. Third, this scheme is also used by the IUCN, making it easier to incorporate data on status and conservation. In accordance with the treatment there, the imperial shag complex is here left unsplit as well, but the king shag complex has been.|$|E

25|$|The {{new name}} was {{adopted in the}} fall of 1952. Members of the group at that time were Haley, Grande, Williamson and Lytle. Grande usually played piano on record, but {{switched}} to accordion for live shows as it was more portable than a piano and <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> during musical numbers that involved a lot of dancing around. Soon after renaming the band, Haley hired his first drummer, Earl Famous. Displeased with lineup, Haley sought out Dick Boccelli (also known as Dick Richards), who turned down the job, but recommended a young drummer Charlie Higler. Soon after, Haley asked Richards again, who then accepted the role. During this time (and as late as the fall of 1955), Haley did not have a permanent lead guitar player, choosing to use session musicians on record and either playing lead guitar himself or having Williamson play steel solos.|$|E
25|$|In {{his prime}} Simpson {{was known for}} his {{technical}} correctness. At slightly below average height, his noted ability to bat for long periods was attributed to his high fitness and concentration levels. He had a wide array of shots, in particular off the back foot. Along with Bill Lawry, he formed an opening partnership that was {{regarded as one of the}} finest in Test history. Simpson was fast between the wickets, and the pair were especially well known for their understanding, as exemplified by their fluency in rotating the strike with quick singles. Simpson's stance was easy and his style attractive, the result of a change of technique in the late 1950s when he turned from playing too square-on to side-on. Simpson found that it made all the difference to him in dealing effectively with the in-dipper and going-away balls. Standing 179cm and 13stone, Simpson was most effective as an attacking batsman. Simpson was best known for his straight-drive and powerfully hit square-cut, as well as an on-drive taken from his toes. He rarely played the hook shot, regarding it as risky, and used the pull shot in moderation. Early in his career, Simpson had a square-on stance but converted to a more side on position, finding it <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> swing bowling.|$|E
500|$|The {{series are}} also studied for non-integer values of n; these {{make up the}} Dirichlet eta function. Part of Euler's {{motivation}} for studying series related to [...] was the functional equation of the eta function, which leads directly to the functional equation of the Riemann zeta function. Euler had already become famous for finding the values of these functions at positive even integers (including the Basel problem), and he was attempting to find the values at the positive odd integers (including Apéry's constant) as well, a problem that remains elusive today. The eta function in particular is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> by Euler's methods because its Dirichlet series is Abel summable everywhere; the zeta function's Dirichlet series is much harder to sum where it diverges. For example, the counterpart of [...] in the zeta function is the non-alternating series , which has deep applications in modern physics but requires much stronger methods to sum.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Easterfield {{was in a}} {{state of}} great perplexity. She had already asked Mr. Hemphill to stay until Saturday, three days off, and she could not tell him to go away, and the awkwardness of his {{remaining}} in the same house with Olive was something not <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with.</b>|$|R
50|$|Finite {{groups are}} <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> {{as one can}} just take a product over all elements, so one can reduce {{to the case of}} {{connected}} reductive groups (as the connected component has finite index). By taking a central extension which is harmless one can also assume the group G is simply connected.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{reference}} state for finite-dimensional coherent states, which is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> in comparison <b>to</b> former suggestions which we briefly review. We also advance explicit calculations {{which shows that}} the phase of the overlap of finite coherent state has a structure analogous to the usual infinite-dimensional continuous coherent states...|$|R
500|$|Rivera is {{a devout}} Christian. During his childhood, {{neither he nor}} his family {{attended}} church, but after a born-again experience around the age of 21, Rivera became religious and converted from Catholicism to a Pentecostal faith. His parents followed his lead after seeing the difference it made in him. Rivera believes that God has a reason for everything that happens. For example, he found his failure in Game 7 of the 2001 World Series <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> when he learned of the consequences it had for teammate Enrique Wilson. Had the Yankees won the series, Wilson would have remained in New York for the championship parade and would have departed for his native Dominican Republic on American Airlines Flight 587, which crashed shortly after takeoff and killed all 260 people aboard. Rivera told Wilson, [...] "I am glad we lost the World Series, because it means that I still have a friend." [...] Rivera's pitching glove was inscribed [...] "Phil. 4:13", in reference to the Bible verse Philippians 4:13 ("I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me").|$|E
500|$|Neither brother married. Wilbur once quipped {{that he did}} {{not have}} time for both a wife and an airplane. Following a brief {{training}} flight he gave to a German pilot in Berlin in June 1911, Wilbur never flew again. He gradually became occupied with business matters for the Wright Company and dealing with different lawsuits. Upon dealing with the patent lawsuits, which had put great strain on both brothers, Wilbur had written in a letter to a French friend, [...] "When we think what we might have accomplished if we had been able to devote this time to experiments, we feel very sad, but it is always <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> things than with men, and no one can direct his life entirely as he would choose." [...] Wilbur spent the next year before his death traveling, where he spent a full six months in Europe attending to various business and legal matters. Wilbur urged American cities to emulate the European – particularly Parisian – philosophy of apportioning generous public space near every important public building. He was also constantly back and forth between New York, Washington and Dayton. All of the stresses were taking a toll on Wilbur physically. Orville would remark that he would [...] "come home white".|$|E

The conventional boundary measurement processing method [23] that the related boundary topology, network parameters and local SE results to the central coordinator can be initially avoided.|$|R
5000|$|We {{say that}} two {{parameters}} θi and θj are orthogonal if {{the element of}} the ith row and jth column of the Fisher information matrix is zero. Orthogonal parameters are <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> {{in the sense that}} their [...] maximum likelihood estimates are independent and can be calculated separately.

She must either give up the project or go with the man. Well, she was equally guilty one way or the other, and being almost callous about detection, she might as well go.
