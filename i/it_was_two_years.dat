5|$|As Connecticut {{was only}} 55% {{complete}} {{when she was}} launched, missing most of her upper works, protection, machinery and armament, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> before Connecticut was commissioned on 29 September 1906. Captain William Swift was the first captain of the new battleship. Connecticut sailed out of New York {{for the first time}} on 15 December 1906, becoming the first ship in the US Navy to ever go to sea without a sea trial. She first journeyed south to the Virginia Capes, where she conducted a variety of training exercises; this was followed by a shakedown cruise and battle practice off Cuba and Puerto Rico. During the cruise, she participated in a search for the missing steamer Ponce.|$|E
5|$|Soaring {{demand for}} coffee and rubber brought Brazil an influx of revenue in the early 1900s. Simultaneously, there was a drive {{on the part of}} {{prominent}} Brazilians, most notably the Baron of Rio Branco, to have the country recognized as an international power. A large naval acquisition program was drawn up and passed by the National Congress of Brazil in October 1904 in accordance with their belief that a powerful navy would be crucial to the achievement of this goal, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> before any ships were ordered.|$|E
5|$|Also at {{the dawn}} of the new century, however, rising demand for coffee and rubber gave the Brazilian {{government}} an influx of revenue. Contemporary writers estimated that seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's coffee supply was grown in Brazil. Prominent Brazilian politicians, most notably Pinheiro Machado and the Baron of Rio Branco, moved to have the country recognized as an international power, as they believed that the short-term windfall would continue. A strong navy was seen as crucial to this goal. The National Congress of Brazil drew up and passed a large naval acquisition program in late 1904, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> before any ships were ordered. While they first ordered three small battleships, the launch of the revolutionary British Dreadnought—which heralded a new and powerful type of warship—caused the Brazilians to cancel their order in favor of two dreadnoughts, with a third to follow.|$|E

Yet <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> earlier, with the arrival of Bill Walsh as the Chargers' offensive coordinator, that the seeds of success were planted. Under Coryell, the Chargers were known as Air Coryell for the deep passing game and the involvement of the tight end as a key receiver. This required a tough, intelligent quarterback with a strong arm. Fouts fit the bill.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} Bhutan's status vis-à-vis the {{government}} of India was reexamined by London in 1932 {{as part of the}} issue of the status of India itself. It was decided to leave the decision to join an Indian federation up to Bhutan when the time came. When British rule over India ended in 1947, so too did Britain's association with Bhutan. India succeeded Britain as the de facto protector of the Himalayan kingdom, and Bhutan retained control over its internal government. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> <b>years,</b> however, before a formal agreement recognized Bhutan's independence.|$|E
25|$|The {{defeat at}} Rignano enabled the Norman conquest of Naples, since Sergius died without heir and the Neapolitan nobility {{could not reach}} a {{succession}} agreement. However, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> between Sergius' death and Naples' incorporation by Sicily. The nobility apparently ruled during the interim, {{which may have been}} the final period of Neapolitan independence from Norman rule. During this period Norman landowners first appear in Naples, although the Pisans (enemies of Roger II) retained their alliance with the duchy and Pisa may have sustained its independence until 1139. That year, Roger absorbed Naples into his kingdom; Pope Innocent II and the Neapolitan nobility acknowledged Roger's young son, Alfonso of Hauteville, as duke.|$|E

In 1969 he became a Junior Research Fellow at Merton College, Oxford, where he had a temporary Oxford master of arts (M.A.) status as a result of becoming a university don. He did not graduate because the University would not allow him to pursue a doctorate in energy, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> before the 1973 oil embargo and energy was not yet considered an academic subject. Lovins resigned his Fellowship and moved to London to pursue his energy work. He moved back to the U.S. in 1981 and settled in western Colorado in 1982.|$|E

[...] Other critics, however, felt that the game failed to change the same tried and tested formula. In its 1998 review, IGN said that Tomb Raider III [...] "solves none of its original dilemmas, and as it stands now, the exploration-adventure genre—one that was revolutionized by Tomb Raider—is in the exact spot <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> ago." ...|$|E

500|$|The need {{to market}} an ARM-compatible version of Windows was {{questioned}} by analysts because of {{recent developments in}} the PC industry; both Intel and AMD introduced x86-based system-on-chip designs for Windows 8, Atom [...] "Clover Trail" [...] and [...] "Temash" [...] respectively, {{in response to the}} growing competition from ARM licensees. In particular, Intel claimed that Clover Trail-based tablets could provide battery life rivaling that of ARM devices; in a test by PC World, Samsung's Clover Trail-based Ativ Smart PC was shown to have battery life exceeding that of the ARM-based Surface. Peter Bright of Ars Technica argued that Windows RT had no clear purpose, since the power advantage of ARM-based devices was [...] "nowhere near as clear-cut as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> ago", and that users would be better off purchasing Office 2013 themselves because of the removed features and licensing restrictions of Office RT.|$|E
500|$|The National Congress of Brazil {{passed a}} large naval {{acquisition}} program on 14 December 1904, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> before any ships were ordered or purchased, and while Rio Branco suggested purchasing used warships {{to fill the}} gap, nothing came of it. By 1906, two factions had developed over which types of ships should be ordered. One, supported by the British armament company Armstrong Whitworth (which eventually received the order), favored a navy centered on {{a small number of}} large warships. The other, supported by Rio Branco, preferred a larger navy composed of smaller warships. Rio Branco, in support of this measure, stated that [...] "with six small battleships we would be much better. If we lost one or two in combat, there would be still four or five left to fight with. But with three ? With two damaged or destroyed, we would be left with one only." ...|$|E

He told a friend: [...] "It took me, I think <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>two</b> <b>years,</b> insistence and wrangling etc., to get hold of their microphone." [...] He recorded over a hundred broadcasts criticizing the United States, Roosevelt, Roosevelt's family and the Jews, and rambling about his poetry, economics and Chinese philosophy. The first was in January 1935, and by February 1940 he was broadcasting regularly; he traveled to Rome one week a month to pre-record the 10-minute broadcasts, for which he was paid around $17, and they were broadcast every three days. The broadcasts required the Italian government's approval, although he often changed the text in the studio. Tytell wrote that Pound's voice had assumed a [...] "rasping, buzzing quality like the sound of a hornet stuck in a jar", that throughout the [...] "disordered rhetoric of the talks he sustained the notes of chaos, hysteria, and exacerbated outrage." [...] The politics apart, Pound needed the money; his father's pension payments had stopped —his father died in February 1942 in Rapallo — and Pound had his mother and Dorothy to look after.|$|E

500|$|As {{early as}} 1923, Rodchenko and others {{published}} {{a report in}} LEF which foretold of Vkhutemas's closure. It {{was in response to}} students' failure to gain a foothold in industry and was entitled, The Breakdown of VKhUTEMAS: Report on the Condition of the Higher Artistic and Technical Workshops, which stated that the school was [...] "disconnected from the ideological and practical tasks of today". In 1927, the school's name was modified: [...] "Institute" [...] replaced [...] "Studios" [...] (Вхутеин, Высший художественно-технический институт), or Vkhutein. Under this reorganisation, the 'artistic' content of the basic course was reduced to one term, when at one point <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>two</b> <b>years.</b> The school appointed a new rector, Pavel Novitsky, who took over from the painter Vladimir Favorsky in 1926. It was under Novitsky's tenure that external political pressures increased, including the [...] "working class" [...] decree, and a series of external reviews by industry, and commercial organisations of student works' viability. The school was dissolved in 1930, and was merged into various other programs. One such merger was with MVTU, forming the Architectural-Construction Institute, which became the Moscow Architectural Institute in 1933. The Modernist movements which Vkhutemas had helped generate were critically considered as abstract formalism, and were succeeded historically by socialist realism, postconstructivism, and the Empire style of Stalinist architecture.|$|E
