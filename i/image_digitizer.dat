40|$|A {{simple method}} for {{analyzing}} droplet holograms is proposed that is readily adaptable to automation using modern <b>image</b> <b>digitizers</b> and analyzers for {{determination of the}} number, location, and size distributions of spherical or nearly spherical droplets. The method determines these parameters by finding the spatial location of best focus of the droplet images. With this location known, the particle size may be determined by direct measurement of image area in the focal plane. Particle velocity and trajectory may be determined by comparison of image locations at different instants in time. The method is tested by analyzing digitized images from a reconstructed in-line hologram, and {{the results show that}} the method is more accurate than a time-consuming plane-by-plane search for sharpest focus...|$|R

40|$|We {{present in}} this study a {{two-phase}} approach to the generation and maintenance of a polygonal cartographic database useful for autonomous vehicle route planning. The database is generated non-interactively from available U. S. Geological Survey topographical maps. The database is maintained interactively by a graphics workstation. The focus {{of this study is}} on the non-interactive generation of the polygonal database. The non-interactive generation process uses both a set of heuristics derived from the characteristics of paper maps and classical region growing. This study presents a two-phase approach to the digital map production problem. The first phase is a non-interactive phase in which general information is gleaned from a paper topographical map with the use of an <b>image</b> <b>digitizer</b> and computer vision software.

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} an {{implementation of a}} digital image-processing system for use in general realtime applications. The system is composed by two major sections: <b>digitizer</b> and <b>image</b> processor. The <b>digitizer</b> can capture an image frame from standard video signal and convert it into digital format. The pixel stream is then fed directly into the image processor section, which is implemented by using a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA), and thus can be programmed to perform any operations within a 3 x 3 mask. Its output pixels are {{at the same rate}} as that of the video scans. An experimental result is given with the FPGA programmed as a binomial mask, for the noise reduction purpose...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Background & Aims: Teleradiology as an {{efficient}} way for avoiding unnecessary transfer of patients to special medical centers requires the images with digital format. However, in some developing countries, including Iran, imaging {{is being done}} using non digital devices. In such cases, changing analog images into digital ones can solve the problem. The method which is nowadays used for digitalizing analog <b>images</b> is using <b>digitizers.</b> Since in some regions digitizers are not available, using digital cameras as more accessible and cost-effective devices is a good choice, provided that the reliability of digital cameras for providing digital formats of radiographs would be confirmed. Method: In this study, at first, 91 radiographs were randomly selected. These images were then shown to a radiologist and {{he was asked to}} interpret them. Next, a digital image was produced from each radiograph using a digital camera. After 40 days, these digital images were shown to the same radiologist and he was asked to interpret them. The interpretations were then analyzed and compared using Kappa agreement coefficient. Results: The calculated Kappa agreement coefficient indicated a “Good” diagnostic agreement (kappa= 0. 708, P < 0. 000) between diagnoses made by using radiographs and their digitalized images. Conclusion: This study recommends that in cases of need for consultation with a specialist, capturing a digital image of radiograph by a digital camera and sending it to the spesialist via an internet line can be a reliable solution. This method {{can be used as a}} useful and cost-effective way of consultation with a radiologist who is working in another medical center.

40|$|Microscopic {{particles}} {{within an}} optical hologram reconstruction {{have been successfully}} measured using an <b>image</b> <b>digitizer</b> and a PC/AT computer. The hologram was recorded during a test burn of some solid rocket fuel and captured a 2 in x 2 in volume of burning particles as they lift from the fuel surface during combustion. The computer processes the digitized images using feature identification algorithms and sizing in the feature's horizontal dimension, its vertical dimension and area. The operation of the algorithms have been validated against calibration objects. Statistical tests show that about 1, 300 particles from several image frames are required to obtain a representative size distribution. Overlying speckle degrades {{the resolution of the}} image and can be reduced by a variety of techniques. The performance of these speckle-reduction techniques has been measured and compared in the areas of speckle reduction, loss of resolution, and processing time.

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 This thesis {{discusses}} the hardware implementations of certain linear and non-linear color space transforms {{thought to be}} useful {{in the analysis of}} wood surfaces for defect detection. The developmental system's color <b>image</b> <b>digitizer</b> contains 5 bits per color while the input signal contains considerably greater resolution. This often degrades the information content of the image when certain color transforms are performed. Performing these transforms at real-time speeds demands extremely fast operating hardware. In order to avoid loss of information content and obtain real-time operating speeds, the color transforms were implemented using analog circuits. Linear transforms, as proposed by Forrer (FORR 1987), were implemented using high speed operational amplifier-based circuits. Non-linear transforms such as ratioing or intensity normalization and contrast enhancement were implemented using high-speed analog divider circuits. The results showed that, for the linear transforms described, significant improvement in image quality was observed. This was supported by analysis of the transformed image histogram. The contrast enhancement circuit has the ability to enhance certain features such as blue stain. All circuits operated at real-time speeds and the resultant images had lower noise content as compared to transformations performed digitally...|$|E
40|$|A {{versatile}} auroral {{imaging system}} capable of high {{spatial and temporal}} resolution imaging at low light levels has been constructed and fielded. The Portable Auroral Imager (PAI) uses as primary detector a third-generation image intensified charge-coupled device (CCD) television camera. A secondary, wider field of view camera provides, along with resident all-sky cameras, important context measurements. Data are recorded onto high-resolution video tape {{at a rate of}} 30 frames per second, each individual video frame receiving an accurate time stamp immediately prior to recording. The field data is later digitized and analyzed in the laboratory using a personal computer based <b>image</b> <b>digitizer</b> and modern image processing workstations. The PAI system is designed primarily for narrow field auroral observations, although the modular design allows the system to be fully customized to meet changing scientific needs. The design, characterization, and operation of the instrument are described in some detail for the purpose of aiding others in emulating or improving upon the concept. The PAI was fielded during two-week-long campaigns in the winters of 1994, 1995, and 1997. The resulting data contained impressive examples of the rich variety of evening and midnight sector short-scale auroral phenomena. Presented in this thesis are four separate phenomenological surveys pertaining to the small-scale aurora, namely, surveys of, (a) very thin auroral forms (less than 100 m widths), (b) “black” aurora...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a virtual image chain for medical display (project VICTOR: granted in the 5 th framework program by European commission). The chain starts from raw data of an <b>image</b> <b>digitizer</b> (CR, DR) or synthetic patterns and covers image enhancement (MUSICA by Agfa) and both display possibilities, hardcopy (film on viewing box) and softcopy (monitor). Key {{feature of the}} chain is a complete image wise approach. A first prototype is implemented in an object-oriented software platform. The display chain consists of several modules. Raw images are either taken from scanners (CR-DR) or from a pattern generator, in which characteristics of DRCR systems are introduced by their MTF and their dose-dependent Poisson noise. The image undergoes image enhancement and comes to display. For soft display, color and monochrome monitors {{are used in the}} simulation. The image is down-sampled. The non-linear response of a color monitor is taken into account by the GOG or S-curve model, whereas the Standard Gray-Scale-Display-Function (DICOM) is used for monochrome display. The MTF of the monitor is applied on the image in intensity levels. For hardcopy display, the combination of film, printer, light-box and viewing condition is modeled. The image is up-sampled and the DICOM-GSDF or a Kanamori Look-Up-Table is applied. An anisotropic model for the MTF of the printer is applied on the image in intensity levels. The density-dependent color (XYZ) of the hardcopy film is introduced by Look-Up-tables. Finally a Human Visual System Model is applied to the intensity images (XYZ in terms of cd/m) in order to eliminate non-visible di#erences. Comparison leads to visible differences, which are quantified by higher order image quality metrics. A specific image viewer is used for the visualizat [...] ...|$|E
40|$|No {{matter how}} {{sophisticated}} one 2 ̆ 7 s statistical classifier might be, {{the success of}} a spectral pattern recognition effort is fundamentally limited by {{the degree to which the}} user can relate existing spectral classes to useful information classes. Many digital classification endeavors are limited not by the sophistication of available classification algorithms but by the ability to adequately tailor training activities to a specific application. This paper discusses a 2 ̆ 2 non-typical 2 ̆ 2 procedure for implementing and improving the training process. The approach involves the use of film recorder output as a training base. Image data within selected training regions are enlarged, contrast stretched, and recorded as 3 -band color composites. These products have been found useful for maximizing the expression of the spectral characteristics of features of interest in the original image. This permits the user to visually evaluate 2 ̆ 2 apparent spectral classes 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 in the data, prior to a supervised classification. The hard copy output offers several advantages over 2 ̆ 2 state of the art 2 ̆ 2 color CRT displays used for the same purpose: hard copy products may be duplicated for wide circulation, thereby involving more people in the ground truth and training procedures; they may be analyzed at length in an office or field situation, unlike on-line CRT 2 ̆ 7 s; and they may be directly compared to reference maps or photos through devices such as a Zoom Transfer Scope. After training sites are located on the enlarged and enhanced film recorded images, training site boundary input to the computer is facilitated by the use of a coordinate digitizer. This permits highly irregular boundaries to be handled and encourages analysis of many sites. In addition, training efforts in resource specific studies can be greatly improved by limiting training and classification to subclasses of the resource type of interest. This is made possible by visual interpretation of the resource type on the film recorded <b>image,</b> <b>digitizer</b> entry, and subsetting of the image data file. This integration of conventional image interpretation and computer-assisted techniques often results in increased classification accuracy and decreased cost, depending on the application at hand. This short paper will discuss the above advantages more extensively, and cover details of the training procedure and its hardware elements as implemented at the University of Minnesota. The results of several sample applications of the approach will also be described...|$|E
