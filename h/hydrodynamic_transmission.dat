25|$|Hydrokinetic {{transmission}} (also called <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>transmission)</b> uses a {{torque converter}}. A torque converter {{consists of three}} main parts, two of which rotate, and one (the stator) that has a lock preventing backwards rotation and adding output torque by redirecting the oil flow at low output RPM. All three main parts are sealed in an oil-filled housing. To match engine speed to load speed over the entire speed range of a locomotive some additional method is required to give sufficient range. One method is to follow the torque converter with a mechanical gearbox which switches ratios automatically, similar to an automatic transmission on a car. Another method is to provide several torque converters each {{with a range of}} variability covering part of the total required; all the torque converters are mechanically connected all the time, and the appropriate one for the speed range required is selected by filling it with oil and draining the others. The filling and draining is carried out with the transmission under load, and results in very smooth range changes with no break in the transmitted power.|$|E

25|$|The triple {{differential}} {{was used}} primarily on war-time and post-war British tanks, {{first on the}} Churchill tank and later on the Cromwell tank and its follow-on designs. It gave these designs unparalleled maneuverability {{and the ability to}} climb that was not matched by other designs until well into the Cold War. The basic version continued to be used on British designs until the TN 10 of the Conqueror, while a modified version, the TN 12, was used on the Chieftain. This system is generally not used today, in favour of improved <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>transmissions</b> in the double differential, starting with the transmission in the Challenger.|$|R

40|$|Until recently, hydrostatic-mechanical {{power split}} CVT {{drivelines}} {{have not found}} a place in construction machinery. The majority of these vehicles still use <b>hydrodynamic</b> powershift <b>transmissions,</b> full-hydrostatic transmissions or mechanical direct-shift transmissions. Hydrostatic drive lines are widely used in construction machinery possessing lower engine power. The upper power range is dominated by <b>hydrodynamic</b> powershift <b>transmissions.</b> Decisions made by vehicle manufacturers about which driveline technology to be used, have been based mainly on reliability, durability, and cost. Fuel economy {{has also been a}} growing trend over the past years; however the additional cost of higher technologies must be compensated by the savings in fuel cost over a time period of 2 - 3 years. The transmission’s efficiency highly contributes to the vehicle’s fuel consumption. ZF has thoroughly studied the possible concepts of hydrostatic-mechanical power split transmissions. The most important requirements of reliability, durability and efficiency were taken into consideration during the concept study. An examination the most typical working cycles showed that a construction machinery transmission needs to be fully power split in all ranges and obtain equal performance in both driving directions. It was also observed that up to 60 % of productive time for construction and forestry equipment was spent at a speed below 12 km/h. For this speed range, achieving the highest possible efficiency is vital. The result of this research is the ZF cPower, which is an output-coupled, fully power split transmission...|$|R

Power transmission from the motor is achieved using a Voith <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>transmission</b> system with a converter (Wandler) and a T 311r coupling. Up to Class 628, a T 320 double-converter transmission was used. Motor and transmission are suspended elastically under the lightweight coach body. The operating brake is an automatic compressed air KE disc brake with automatic load braking and electronic anti-skid protection. In addition, for rapid braking, electromagnetic rail brakes are used; these can also be activated separately if required.|$|E

50|$|From 2nd to 4th gear, in {{contrast}} to the 1st gear, power transmission in 2nd to 4th gear occurs purely mechanically. The transition from 1st gear into 2nd gear occurs automatically, independent on the driving speed and the driving peddle position. The <b>hydrodynamic</b> power <b>transmission</b> is switched off in 2nd gear. This occurs by the pump brake being closed, which stops the impeller. At the same time, the turbine wheel is not transmitting torque to the turbine gear due to the open turbine brake. The transmission ratio of the 2nd gear corresponds to the input differential.When changing from 2nd into 3rd gear, the input clutch opens and the lockup clutch, is shut. As a result, the drive shaft is, by the outer rim of the locked up clutch, directly connected with the planetary gear shaft, and thus the output shaft. The ratio is now 1:1.Depending on the position of the accelerator pedal, the vehicle load and the topography, the shift from 3rd to 4th gear occurs automatically. During this transition, the locked up clutch opens while the coupling for the 4th gear, the fast release coupling, closes.The 4th gear represents the overdrive gear, with the ratio of 0.7 or 0.73 depending on the differential.|$|R

50|$|Closed {{loop systems}} in mobile {{equipment}} are generally {{used for the}} transmission {{as an alternative to}} mechanical and hydrodynamic (converter) transmissions. The advantage is a stepless gear ratio (continuously variable speed/torque) and a more flexible control of the gear ratio depending on the load and operating conditions. The hydrostatic transmission is generally limited to around 200 kW maximum power, as the total cost gets too high at higher power compared to a <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>transmission.</b> Large wheel loaders for instance and heavy machines are therefore usually equipped with converter transmissions. Recent technical achievements for the converter transmissions have improved the efficiency and developments in the software have also improved the characteristics, for example selectable gear shifting programs during operation and more gear steps, giving them characteristics close to the hydrostatic transmission.|$|E

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy(PhD) Particle {{formation}} in RAFT-mediated emulsion polymerization {{has been studied}} using reaction calorimetry. By measuring the heat flow during controlled feed ab-initio emulsion polymerization {{in the presence of}} amphipathic RAFT agents, particle formation by self-assembly of these species could be observed. Two different monomer systems, i. e. styrene and n-butyl acrylate, and various degrees of hydrophobicity of the initial macro-RAFT agents have been studied and compared. The different macro-RAFT agents were synthesized by first forming a hydrophilic block of poly(acrylic acid) that would later on act as the electrosteric stabilizing group for the particles. Subsequently, different lengths of hydrophobic blocks were grown at the reactive end of the poly(acrylic acid) hydrophilic block via the RAFT-mediated controlled radical polymerization, either comprised of n-butyl acrylate or styrene. Two processes govern particle formation: adsorption of macro-RAFT agents onto growing particles and formation of new particles by initiation of micellar aggregates or by homogeneous nucleation. Competition between these processes could be observed when monomers with a relatively high (n-butyl acrylate) or low (styrene) propagation rate coefficient were used. A model describing particle formation has been developed and the results of model calculations are compared with experimental observations. Preliminary modeling results based on a set of reasonable physico-chemical parameters already showed good agreement with the experimental results. Most parameters used have been verified experimentally. The development of the molecular weight distribution of the macro-RAFT agents has been analyzed by different techniques. Quantification of the particle formation process by analytical techniques was difficult, but qualitative insights into the fundamental steps governing the nucleation process have been obtained. The amount of macro-RAFT agents initially involved in particle formation could be determined from the increase of molecular weight. The particle size distribution has been measured by capillary <b>hydrodynamic</b> fractionation, <b>transmission</b> electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. From the data obtained from these particle-sizing techniques, the number of particles during the reaction could be monitored, leading to an accurate estimate for the particle formation time. Upon implementation of the experimental data obtained for the surface active macro-RAFT systems, the model demonstrated to be very sensitive towards the “headgroup” area of the macro-RAFT species. Three nucleation cases based on the initial surface activity of the macro-RAFT species in the aqueous phase are proposed to explain the deviations from the assumptions of the nucleation model. Even though the macro-RAFT species have a narrow molecular weight distribution, they are nevertheless made up of a distribution of block lengths of polystyrene upon a distribution of block lengths of poly(acrylic acid). The resulting differences in initial surface activity are the most probable reason for the observed differences between model calculations and experimental results for the nucleation time and particle size distribution of the final latex product. With the procedure described above, latexes have been synthesized without using conventional surfactants and the mechanisms involved in the particle formation for these systems have been elucidated. The results of this work enable production of latex systems with well defined molecular mass distributions and narrow particle size distributions. Furthermore, the technique based on the application of amphipathic RAFT agents is promising for the production of complex polymeric materials in emulsion polymerization on a technical scale...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{doctoral}} thesis is the extended analysis of the flow around a Floating Breakwater, (FB), fixed on the free surface, and {{the investigation of the}} parameters that are related with the structure’s efficiency. Such a study requires a numerical model that accounts for complicated hydrodynamics mechanisms that are developed near the structure, such as viscous and turbulence effects, vorticity generation. For this reason, a Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) solver is used in the numerical part of the thesis. The efficiency of the FB is evaluated through the calculation of the <b>hydrodynamic</b> coefficients, the <b>transmission,</b> reflection and dissipation coefficients, Ct, Cr and Cd respectively. The effects of the structure parameters, such as the draught, dr and the width, W, of the FB and the wave parameters, wavelength, L and wave steepness, Hi/L as well as the wave overtopping, on the efficiency of the FB are investigated. The effect of an attached plate at the seaward side of the FB on the efficiency of the structure is also investigated. Also an empirical formula that relates the hydrodynamic coefficients Ct, Cr and Cd with the above parameters is developed for operational reasons. In addition to the numerical investigation, an experimental study of the effect of wave overtopping on the hydrodynamic field and the efficiency of a fixed FB is performed in the wave flume of the Laboratory of Hydraulics, Department of Civil Engineering, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. Measurements of the free surface and overtopping variation are performed by applying video image processing on video recorded data obtained by High Definition (HD) video cameras. Wave height measurements, free surface variation at several locations landward and above the deck of the FB together with the variation of Ct, Cr and Cd are compared against the numerical results, and an analysis of the detailed velocity field {{in the vicinity of the}} structure is performed. Finally, the efficiency of various types of FBs, alternative to the typical box pontoon, is investigated. The FBs examined, under regular monochromatic waves, are a double FB, a catamaran FB and a trapezoid with inclined faces of 45 o. Detailed hydrodynamic characteristics such as velocity, turbulent kinetic energy and vorticity are also considered for improving the design of such structures. ...|$|R
40|$|The article’s {{subject is}} {{to study and}} {{describe}} the processes in the hydrodynamic coupling during its operation. The hydrodynamic coupling {{is a type of}} <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>transmission</b> that provides a flexible connection between the input and output shafts, in contrast to the mechanical coupling. Currently, the fluid couplings are widely used and the theoretical description of their operation has been given long before. However, in Russia these units are not produced, the theoretical model is very simple while the experimental data are scattered and non-systematized. So the problem is relevant and requires consideration. The research objective is to complement the existing theoretical model for better describing the fluid coupling operation as well as to compare the results, based on its using, with the numerical simulation results. The main part of the article contains these sections. The mathematical model shows: the equations used for theoretical description of the fluid coupling operation, the basic hydrodynamic equations converted to solve the problem in a stationary setting, and the applied turbulence model (k-ω). The author backslides from the standard jet theory in which the calculation is performed at an average trickle in order to take into consideration the non-uniformity of the velocity distribution in the fluid coupling. The article also raised the issue on the applicability of the stationary formulation of the problem for the numerical simulation. The study revealed that the solutions obtained under stationary and non-stationary calculations practically match. The verification was conducted by three points of characteristic of the hydraulic coupling. The article gives the fluid coupling dimensions, represents an image of its threedimensional model and of the computational grid. It also shows some figures to illustrate the processes in a fluid coupling obtained by its numerical modeling. During the study it was found out that the proposed theoretical model allows us to have higher precision and higher quality in representation of fluid coupling characteristics; the article shows the appropriate graphs. Then a disadvantage is a lack of experimental work. Concerning this issue, the author refers to the publications in which the verification of the results of numerical simulation and experimental results has been conducted showing that their coinciding is quite accurate. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Scottish salmon {{industry}} is facing {{challenges in the}} control of aquatic infectious disease, {{as is the case}} in other countries such as Chile and Norway. Disease outbreaks can have an enormous economic impact and possibly affect wild fish populations. Disease transmission in an aquatic environment is complex and there are several transmission routes (vertical transmission, natural reservoirs, <b>hydrodynamic</b> <b>transmission</b> and long-distance movements). Effective control methods such as vaccines are not available in all cases and therefore disease prevention remains a priority. In livestock, epidemiological network models have been proven to be a highly useful tool to investigate the role of different transmission routes on the course of epidemics and have the potential to provide the same utility for aquatic networks. Understanding the complex contact network will result in more effective disease prevention, surveillance systems and control strategies. The aim of this thesis was to investigate the Scottish live fish movement network and its consequences for pathogen transmission between farms in order to develop and optimize control strategies for epidemics. The main objective of chapter 3 was to investigate the effect of different fallowing strategies on the spread of diseases with different transmission properties. A network model was constructed that included both local transmission and long-distance transmission. The basic structure of this network was a ring model where neighbours within a management area could infect each other and non-local transmission occurred at random. The results showed that when long-distance transmission was under reasonable control in comparison with local transmission risk, synchronized fallowing at the management area level was potentially a highly effective tool in the control of infectious diseases. Chapter 4 presents a detailed description of the number of live fish movements and their timing for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in Scottish aquaculture. For this, movement records from 2002 to 2004 were provided by Marine Scotland, Aberdeen. Salmon are anadromous and have a freshwater (FW) and seawater phase (SW). Scottish live fish movements can be divided in FW-FW, FW-SW, SW-SW, SW-FW and “other” movements. The latter are mainly movements from and to research sites. This study showed that the contact structure and timing of live fish movements are seasonal and differ largely between production phases. Disease control measures should take these differences into account to optimize their strategies. In chapter 4, live fish movements were shown to be seasonal; therefore in chapter 5 the main aim was to quantify the effects of seasonality of live fish movements on the course of epidemics. The results showed that the sequence of salmon movements is important for the course of an epidemic. Seasonality is important when local transmission is higher than 0. 05 per contact per week and when the movements are not clustered and when movements do not occur in a specific order based on the specific assumptions made in this model. In conclusion, this thesis described the complex live fish movement structure of salmon in Scotland and showed that biosecurity in SW farms is good but could be further improved if all management areas apply synchronized fallowing. The results of this study suggest that biosecurity between freshwater sites could be improved by the application of a system similar to management areas in SW farms...|$|E
