Ten years; who knows—it’s too dependent on fuel prices, FAA policy, etc. Overall, I think our industry will continue to mature, particularly as AKIA is successful in growing and having a positive inﬂuence on the professionalism of its industry members and on the builders/pilots of its products. With concern over fuel prices, we might see a trend toward lower-powered aircraft intended more for pure sport ﬂying rather than the trend toward cross-country aircraft, which has been the norm over the past 30 years. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> toward the end of that period, there might be some design ventures into electric-powered aircraft, but only if battery technology improves signiﬁcantly. We might see more motorglider-type homebuilts, tied both to high fuel prices and emerging electric-propulsion technology.What we do at Van's could mirror some of the above thinking. Unfortunately, I don't see the growth potential that there was in the 1980s and 1990s. There seems to be a shrinking pilot base from which to draw people to build kits. Plus, with demographic changes, there is possibly a diminishing interest in, or ability to undertake, aircraft building as a pastime. Hopefully, EAA and AOPA initiatives to interest more people in learning to ﬂy will help create a larger market for our airplanes.Emerging markets such as China and India could also boost demand for our products, but entire infrastructures will need to be formed before small players like us could beneﬁt.|$|E

40|$|Climatic {{conditions}} have profound {{effects on the}} geographical distribution of species across diverse taxa and regions. However, the role of traits of species that underpin the relationship between distribution and climate is poorly understood, especially in animals. Although many physiological and local-scale studies on animals have demonstrated associations between traits and climate, to what extent such mechanistic links may impact distribution patterns of species at macroecological scales remains largely unknown. In insects, colour and size are two very important and highly multifunctional traits, which play pivotal roles in natural and sexual selection, and may hence be related to climate. The colour of insects comprises several functions, namely crypsis, aposematism, sexual selection, species recognition, UV resistance, pathogen resistance and thermoregulation. However, {{the relative importance of}} single functions is often unclear because several functions of colouration can act simultaneously. Hitherto, thermoregulation through thermal melanism {{is supposed to be the}} dominant function of colouration in insects. Dark-coloured individuals heat up faster and attain higher steady-state body temperatures compared to light-coloured individuals of similar size under equal environmetal conditions and light-coloured individuals are supposed to have advantages in warmer climates because of a reduced risk of overheating. However, it is unknown to which extent this physical mechanism influences the colour lightness of species in response to different thermal environments at macroecological scales and across continents. Moreover, thermoregulation is not the only function of colouration of insects and it is unknown to which extent other functions of colouration dominate in particular geographical areas and taxa and thereby form macroecological patterns. The size of insects affects almost all physiological rates (e. g. rate of oxygen consumption), which subsequently determine or constrain fertility, mortality and ecological processes such as competitive interactions between individuals or species. In this way, body size is ultimately linked to the spatiotemporal distribution and abundance of animals and has important implications for the impact of climate warming – from biomass production by single species to the structure and dynamics of communities. However, a synthesis and analysis of the major environmental driver for the large-scale geographical variation of insect body size is missing so far. In this thesis, I use lepidopteran and odonate species to address the following questions: i) Are assemblages of diurnal insects darker coloured in colder regions and lighter coloured in warmer regions? ii) Is crypsis, pathogen resistance or protection from UV radiation associated with large-scale geographical variation in the colouration of insects? iii) What are the major environmental drivers for the large-scale geographical variation of body size in insects? In conclusion, colour and size of insects are related to their geographical distribution even at macroecological scales. The underlying mechanisms are especially driven by environmental temperatures: for colour because of its effect on thermoregulation and immune function, and for size because of the temperature dependency of metabolic rates and voltinism. With global warming, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> thus <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> especially dark-coloured and/or large aquatic insects might shift their distribution and retreat from warmer areas. Furthermore, insect species with the ability to increase their annual number of generations should benefit and extend their distribution to higher latitudes...|$|R
40|$|Using a firm-level panel {{data set}} I assess whether dynamic models of in- vestment provide an empirically {{fruitful}} framework for analyzing tax effects {{on changes in}} capital stock. In particular I estimate a one-step error correction model (ECM) complementing the usual estimation of a distributed lag model. A correction term accounts for non-random sample attrition, {{which has not been}} considered in previous studies on investment even though most (if not all) panel data sets on firms are incomplete. Both, ECM and distributed lag model, suggest that user cost of capital and output have an economically and statistically significant influence on capital formation. In the ECM, however, estimates are larger in size and match theoretical pre- dictions more closely. My preferred estimate of - 1. 3 implies that a decrease in the user cost of capital by 10 percent will increase the firm's capital stock by 13 percent, on average. Taking my elasticity estimate to the Corporate Tax Reform 2008 <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> the reform only slightly increases cap- ital stock, since the rather strong reduction in corporate income tax rate was partly compensated for by stricter depreciation allowances. Investment dynamics appear to be crucial for the coefficients of cash flow variables in investment equations. While cash flow effects are present in the (first- differenced) distributed lag model, they vanish in the ECM. This leads me to conclude that well documented cash flow effects point at dynamic misspecification in previous studies.

We will examine the alternative constructivist theories, e. g., socio-cultural constructivism and cognitive constructivism, and the pragmatism of Richard Rorty. However, rather than focusing on the differences between these frameworks, our emphasis will be on the implications of the broader, common framework for the design of instruction. Hence we will spend most of the semester discussing strategies for designing and delivering instruction, e. g., the work of Bransford, Collins, Pea, Jonassen, Spiro, Fosnot, Senge, and Schank. We will consider both business and schooling environments for learning [...] there is significant work in both domains. There will be particular emphasis of the use of technology in instruction. We will look at the communication, information, and context providing roles of technology as contrasted to the traditional approach of using technology to deliver instruction (to teach). We will also pay particular attention to problem based learning as one instructional model. In PBL there is particular emphasis {{on the role of the}} facilitator as a learning coach (process orientation) as opposed to a content provider. There is also a particular emphasis on supporting the development of abductive reasoning skills so that the learner develops the ability to be an effective problem solver in the content domain. The major paper/project for the course will be the design of instruction to train individuals to be learning coaches in a problem based learning or goal based scenario learning environment. That is, how do you support teachers in adapting the role of learning coach (which, of course, requires us to understand what it means to be a learning coach). Design teams will be formed with the teams all working on this same design problem.

40|$|Plants {{can vary}} in their mating systems from {{completely}} inbreeding to completely outcrossing, with intermediate forms referred to as mixed mating systems. Arabidopsis lyrata is a strongly outcrossing perennial due to a sporophytic self incompatibility (SI) system. The species occurs in temperate regions of the Northern hemisphere where in Europe its SI system is fully working but around the Great Lakes of North America some populations of A. lyrata show a breakdown in SI. Consequently these North American populations are inbreeding or have a mixed mating system next to outcrossing populations with a working SI system. In this thesis I used North American A. lyrata to investigate the evolutionary consequences involving variation in mating systems. First of all I {{was interested in the}} time that populations had been isolated from each other in the past that could explain differences in mating systems. In order to determine whether populations experienced a breakdown of SI independently or whether this originated from a single event I used chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) markers to reveal deep phylogeny and microsatellite markers to determine recent population genetic patterns. The results showed a loss of SI in populations from all three detected cpDNA haplotypes. Microsatellite data showed that predominantly inbreeding populations sharing one of these haplotypes showed high levels of homozygosity and that in all three haplotype lineages self-compatible individuals always had reduced heterozygosity compared to self-incompatible individuals. The data further showed that there had likely been at least two independent postglacial colonization routes {{to the north of the}} great lakes. This was consistent with phylogeographic studies of other organisms with limited dispersal such as reptiles and amphibians. The next question was the role of inbreeding depression in the loss of SI. Inbreeding depression is defined as the decline of fitness after an inbreeding event. Inbreeding causes an increase in homozygosity that exposes recessive deleterious mutations, which would normally be sheltered in a heterozygous state, and causes a fitness decline. Individuals experiencing a loss of SI will have higher inbreeding levels and can result in inbreeding depression, which is thought to maintain the SI system. To gain more insight into the role of inbreeding depression in the shift from self-incompatibility to self-compatibility, I conducted an experiment in which I created outcrossed and selfed offspring from self-compatible and self-incompatible mothers from populations with different outcrossing histories. I monitored the offspring for early- and late acting fitness traits like germination rate, growth and time to flowering. I found inbreeding depression in only one late acting fitness trait, the increase in leaves 5 weeks after germination, to be significantly higher for self-incompatible than self-compatible individuals. I also conducted a regression analysis where relative fitness (the ratio of the fitness trait values of selfed and outcrossed offspring) per mother was regressed against population heterozygosity and found a significantly negative regression. This result suggested that individuals from a population with a relatively high heterozygosity suffered more from inbreeding depression than individuals from populations with a relatively low heterozygosity. This indicated that the history of outcrossing of a population, or purging, played an important role in the shift from outcrossing to inbreeding. The detection of inbreeding depression could not be evident by only looking at life history traits under greenhouse conditions. But stressful environmental conditions like a pathogen infection could magnify inbreeding depression. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> <b>that</b> predominantly outcrossing populations would have a higher heterozygosity than predominantly inbreeding populations and therefore be able to show a higher fitness when exposed to a pathogen. To test this hypothesis I used four outcrossing and four inbreeding populations, which I infected with the crucifer pathogen Albugo candida and measured relative growth rates (RGR) and monitored resistance rates. The results showed that there were three infection phenotypes: resistant (no signs of infection), partially resistant (only the initially infected parts showed symptoms) and susceptible (symptoms present on the whole plant). The inbreeding populations showed a bimodal distribution of resistance as two populations showed a high rate of resistance and two showed a low rate of resistance. The outcrossing populations showed a much more uniform distribution of resistant individuals with a higher rate of partially infected individuals across populations than inbreeding populations. Resistant and partially resistant individuals did not differ significantly in their RGR from each other but both had a significantly lower RGR than the untreated control group and a significantly higher RGR than the susceptible individuals. This suggested a cost of resistance that was lower than a cost of being susceptible in the presence of a pathogen. There was no effect of mating system on RGR, which was primarily caused by the fact that two inbreeding populations contained a high amount of resistant individuals and an outcrossing population that showed a very low amount of partially resistant and resistant individuals. The difference in resistance to A. candida in A. lyrata differed much more between inbreeding than between outcrossing populations. This suggested that alleles responsible for resistance were concentrated in homozygous form in inbreeding populations and both homozygous and heterozygous form in outcrossing populations. This would mean that mating system plays a role in susceptibility, as resistance genes would be concentrated in certain individuals in inbreeding populations as opposed to a more modal distribution in outcrossing populations. A shift in mating system often has an effect on floral traits, as there is a lack of necessity to attract pollinators. I wanted to test whether these changes were apparent in A. lyrata by comparing pollinator attractants and sexual floral traits between strongly outcrossing and strongly inbreeding populations. I hypothesized that individuals depending on pollinators for outcrossing would show a higher emission of volatiles and floral traits that had evolved to optimize pollen transmission to conspecifics. Autonomously selfing individuals would be independent of pollinators so should show a reduced volatile emission pattern, a floral trait composition that evolved to transmit pollen to their own stigma, and a reduction in floral display compared to outcrossers. My results showed a somewhat contradicting pattern as self-compatible individuals showed higher volatile emission than self-incompatible individuals but self-incompatible individuals showed larger petal size than self-compatible individuals. Pistil height and stamen length were strongly correlated but petal size seemed to co-vary relatively independent from pistil and stamen length. I found no effect of mating system on the evolvement of floral traits to optimize pollen to the stigma and contradicting patterns for pollinator attractant traits. Due to low sample sizes this study turned out to be a pilot study for further research so the results in this study were not conclusive at this stage. Finally I conclude that SI has been lost independently several times and the low observed genetic load in the North American populations compared to the European populations could be responsible for that. There have probably been two independent colonization routes to the North of the Great Lakes following the last glaciation in which a Northern distributed cpDNA haplotype lineage seems to have a lower frequency of SC individuals than a southern cpDNA haplotype lineage. Inbreeding populations showed a bimodal distribution of infection phenotypes among individuals compared to outcrossing populations that showed a more evenly distributed of infection phenotypes among individuals which is thought to be caused by higher heterozygosity in outcrossing populations. Traits involved with pollinator attraction show a contradicting pattern with high volatile emissions for self-compatible individuals, which could be due to the dependence on pollinators for self-fertilization in self-compatible plants. ...|$|E

It has been, for twenty years. More importantly, it is a National Shame. Why was this emergency allowed to develop to the stage that ordinary Australians are outraged. And whose shame is it? The blame game, which I do not subscribe to, but which I will move into for this specific article, rests with government. How come the average Australian did not know when government have known for many years? How do I know they have known. Because, apart from the reports I have been involved with, I have had ministers say to me: Well, we know the problems. You tell us the solutions. I therefore must assume they knew the problems. I have been looking for solutions since 1992. This morning I asked myself: If I were prime minister, with all his powers, what <b>would</b> <b>I</b> have done? Firstly <b>I</b> <b>would</b> understand and respond accordingly to {{the fact that this is}} not an issue isolated to “Aboriginal Lands” in the Northern Territory. In the short term In the short term, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> focus on a child centred approach to building child centred, child safe communities. A child centred approach: My first question would be to ask what child safe places are already within communities. How can I support them? Often the safe house in the community is inhabited by a grannie on welfare, who opens her door to any child in need. She is someone who, somehow, like the miracle worker with loaves and fishes, can feed many children from her welfare cheque. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> support those people who are already doing hard jobs with little or no resources. Secondly, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> ask for Aboriginal peoples living in remote Aboriginal communities, rural towns and urban centres to put up their hands if they wanted to be involved in a long term approach to building their futures, from within a child centred-child safe infrastructure. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> then, in the short term, begin to work with select communities from each region across Australia, to help build their capacity. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> do this with an understanding that each community I worked with, supported and resourced, would be obliged to work, in turn, with others near them. In the short to medium term <b>I</b> <b>would</b> provide educational opportunities to increase skill development which could be piggybacked from one community to another. Third, following from my child centred approach <b>I</b> <b>would</b> immediately start to build networks of workers, already out there, on the ground, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> build from their knowledge and expertise, resourcing them to do their jobs without the stress levels they live with, on a day-to-day basis. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> provide educational opportunities to workers so they feel capable of working with the child, who as described on page 67 of the Northern Teritory report, saw his mother shot in the head and had to clean her brains up of the floor. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> ensure that workers have clear child trauma counselling skills by providing short courses for culturally safe crisis intervention. These are both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal workers who have, as their fundamental work ethic, the rights of the child to live and learn in child safe, child friendly environments. These workers would include police who are legislated to protect children from harm. Hence restricting access to alcohol and other drugs is an important part of their work responsibility. Social workers, and child protection officers who see the damage pornography does to the developing child would be encouraged to work with police to help restrict access to such material. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> charge mine workers, and mining companies for the behaviours of their employees, and others such as mechanics, school teachers, builders, who are found with such materials, on Aboriginal lands, in Aboriginal communities. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> school teachers to embed in their class curriculum, modalities and activities which heal trauma. In the medium term In the medium term, if I were the prime minister <b>I</b> <b>would</b> build into all that I do, a community strengths based approach, grounded in advancing education at all levels. The strengths based approach would provide educational opportunities for Indigenous Australians to acquire skills so they can work with their own people, and others, for healthy early childhood development; education for life long learning, and education for healing. Such educational packages would be both community based and tertiary delivered. They would have formal accreditation so that graduates could work in any field that helps build a society where children will always feel and be safe. This approach is an Indigenous employment strategy, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> build that into my government’s employment and enterprise strategies. A long term approach embedded in education and quality research In the longer term, if I were the prime minister, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> embed in all that I do, research on the ground. Those researchers undertaking professional doctorates, with scholarships for Indigenous Australians, would work with those working on the ground, and would document the activities and processes, so that in five or ten years time, I could show the Australian nation what works, why it works, and how it would work in the towns and regions of Everywhere. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> then <b>that</b> we <b>would</b> be able to work together, all of us, to build a future for all people in this country. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> then be able to say to my senior bureaucrats: you now have the practice based evidence. Support these approaches, on behalf of all Australians. But I am not the prime minister. And I am sorry that I am not, for if I were this prime minister, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> ask of myself: am I now willing to say sorry for my government’s inability to respond to this long term “emergency,” an emergency that has existed over the ten years that I have been prime minister of this country? Am I willing to say sorry on behalf of my ministers, who have known of this crisis for many years, for their lack of will to do their jobs? Their inaction has profoundly deepened this so-called emergency. If I were the prime minister <b>I</b> <b>would</b> sit in deep soul searching about my lack of leadership in response to these critical needs, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> acknowledge that in my mandate on behalf of all Australians, I have failed Aboriginal children today. And <b>I</b> <b>would</b> say Sorry.

The first studies the effect of a large-scale program that aimed to improve air quality in New York City, and its effect on people’s valuation of residential real estate. The second explores how people respond differently to heat waves, with multiple consecutive days of high temperatures, than to single days with high temperatures, by increasing their demand for air conditioning and electricity use. In the third, we estimate household preferences over local climates, and use the estimates to project the welfare loss due to climate change by the year 2100. In Chapter 1 I present evidence of inefficiency in the valuation of an important non-market good, air quality, in New York City. Large buildings burning fuel oil for heat are a major contributor to particulate matter and other air pollutants in NYC. A recent NYC policy that rapidly phased out certain types of fuel oil boilers, combined with a randomly-assigned compliance deadline, gives me exogenous variation in air quality. Using the universe of home sales between 2003 and 2014, I test whether the conversion of a dirty oil boiler affects nearby home prices, and furthermore, whether this effect is different during different months of the year. In the absence of information asymmetry and projection bias in the housing market, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>expect</b> to find <b>that</b> an oil boiler conversion increases nearby housing prices, and that this effect is nearly constant across the year. Instead, I find that while there is a positive effect on housing prices, the effect is much stronger for sales that occur during winter months, when boilers are running and emissions are visible. This indicates that home buyers are either uninformed about local air quality during seasons different than that in which they made the purchase decision, or suffer from projection bias. I interpret this as evidence of inefficiency in the housing market and in the valuation of air quality. In Chapter 2 I conduct a panel-data analysis, presenting evidence that high temperatures have a lagged effect on residential electricity use. The effects of temperature on contemporaneous residential electricity demand have been well studied. However, little research has been done on how high temperatures may also affect electricity use that occurs several hours later, due to physical or behavioral effects. I find that the direct effect of lagged temperatures {{does not seem to be}} important, but that interactions between current and previous temperatures are significant, suggesting that consecutive days of high heat do effect electricity use. Chapter 3 studies household preferences over temperatures and climate, in a joint work with David Albouy, Ryan Kellogg, and Hendrik Wolff. We present a hedonic framework to estimate U. S. households’ preferences over local climates, using detailed weather and 2000 Census data. We find that Americans favor a daily average temperature of 65 degrees Fahrenheit, that they will pay more on the margin to avoid excess heat than cold, and that damages increase less than linearly over extreme cold. These preferences vary by location due to sorting or adaptation. Changes in climate amenities under business-as-usual predictions imply annual welfare losses of 1 to 4 percent of income by 2100, holding technology and preferences constant...|$|R
