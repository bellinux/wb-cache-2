5|$|Bohrium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure (c/a=1.62), similar to its lighter congener rhenium. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> very heavy metal with a density of around 37.1g/cm3, which would be the third-highest of any of the 118 known elements, lower than only meitnerium (37.4g/cm3) and hassium (41g/cm3), the two following elements in the periodic table. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from bohrium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough bohrium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.|$|E
5|$|Darmstadtium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and to crystallize in the body-centered cubic structure, unlike its lighter congeners which crystallize in the face-centered cubic structure, because it {{is expected}} to have different electron charge densities from them. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> very heavy metal with a density of around 34.8g/cm3.

This results from meitnerium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough meitnerium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.

5|$|Roentgenium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and to crystallize in the body-centered cubic structure, unlike its lighter congeners which crystallize in the face-centered cubic structure, due to its being expected to have different electron charge densities from them. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> very heavy metal with a density of around 28.7g/cm3; in comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of only 22.61g/cm3.

5|$|Rutherfordium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure (c/a=1.61), similar to its lighter congener hafnium. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> very heavy metal with a density of around 23.2g/cm3; in comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of 22.61g/cm3.

The atomic radius for rutherfordium {{is expected}} to be around 150pm. Due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, the Rf+ and Rf2+ ions are predicted to give up 6d electrons instead of 7s electrons, which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologues.|$|E
5|$|The open cabildo {{was held}} on May 22, 1810; it was debated whether the viceroy should {{continue}} in office, and if not, who should replace him. The first opinion was from Bishop Benito Lue y Riega, who held that Cisneros should continue and that, if all of Spain was conquered by France, peninsulars were meant to rule in the Americas. Castelli made a counter-argument, based on {{the doctrine of the}} retroversion of the sovereignty of the people that he had already employed in the defense of Paroissien. He insisted that {{in the absence of a}} legitimate authority, sovereignty should be returned to the people; they should govern themselves. The idea of dismissing the viceroy ultimately prevailed, but as Buenos Aires had no authority to decide unilaterally the new form of government, they would elect a provisional government. A congress of deputies called from all other cities would take the final decision. However, there were disputes over who should exercise the provisional government: some argued that the Cabildo should do so, and others that <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> Junta. Castelli bowed to Saavedra's proposal to form a Junta, but with the proviso that the procurator of the Cabildo, Julián de Leiva, had a decisive vote in the appointment. By adding this proviso, Castelli sought to add the former supporters of Martín de Álzaga, such as Mariano Moreno, Domingo Matheu, and Leiva himself.|$|E

25|$|The term post-anarchism was {{originated}} by Saul Newman, {{and first}} received popular attention {{in his book}} From Bakunin to Lacan {{to refer to a}} theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and poststructuralist thought. Subsequent to Newman's use of the term, however, it has taken {{on a life of its}} own and a wide range of ideas including post-modernism, autonomism, post-left anarchy, situationism, post-colonialism and Zapatismo. By its very nature post-anarchism rejects the idea that <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> coherent set of doctrines and beliefs. As such it is difficult, if not impossible, to state with any degree of certainty who should or should not be grouped under the rubric. Nonetheless key thinkers associated with post-anarchism include Saul Newman, Todd May, Lewis Call, Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari and Michel Onfray.|$|E
25|$|Arriving {{once again}} in Paris in late September 1842, he {{accomplished}} the revisions to the two Italian operas and he received a suggestion from Jules Janin, the newly appointed director of the Théâtre-Italien, that he might compose a new opera for that house. Janin's idea was that <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> new opera buffa and tailored to the talents of some major singers including Giulia Grisi, Antonio Tamburini, and Luigi Lablache who had been hired. The result {{turned out to be}} the comic opera, Don Pasquale, planned for January 1843. While preparations were underway, other ideas came to Donizetti and, discovering Cammarano's libretto for Giuseppe Lillo's unsuccessful 1839 Il Conte di Chalais, he turned it into the first two acts of Maria di Rohan within twenty-four hours. Another opera with Scribe as librettist was in the works: it was to be Dom Sébastien, roi de Portugal planned for November 1843 in Paris.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} scene, Odysseus threatens the sorceress with a drawn sword, as Homer {{describes}} it. However, he is sometimes depicted carrying spears as well, {{as in the}} Athens lekythos, while Homer reports {{that it was a}} bow he had slung over his shoulder. In this episode Circe is generally shown in flight, and on the Erlangen lekythos can clearly be seen dropping the bowl and wand behind her. Two curiously primitive wine bowls incorporate the Homeric detail of Circe's handloom, at which the men approaching her palace could hear her singing sweetly as she worked. In the 5th century skyphos from Boeotia an apparently crippled Odysseus leans on a crutch while a woman with negroid features holds out a disproportionately large bowl. In the other, a pot-bellied hero brandishes a sword while Circe stirs her potion. Both these may depict the scene as represented in one or other of the comic satyr plays which deal with their encounter. Little remains of these now beyond a few lines by Aeschylus, Ephippus of Athens and Anaxilas. Other vase paintings from the period suggest that Odysseus' half-transformed animal-men formed the chorus in place of the usual satyrs. The reason that <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> subject of such plays is that wine drinking was often central to their plot. Later writers were to follow Socrates in interpreting the episode as illustrating the dangers of drunkenness.|$|E
