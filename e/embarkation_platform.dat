She is today one of many ships that operate around the Fiji Islands exploring the Mamanuca and Yasawa Islands every week and Vanua Levu once a month. What makes the Reef Endeavour exceptional, is her small size allows her to reach remote reefs, islands and shallow bays, where bigger ships cannot proceed. Her design allows for big ship qualities, whilst maintaining a small ship feel. These features include, a pool, spa, and an <b>embarkation</b> <b>platform</b> allowing access and storage for smaller boats.|$|E
5000|$|The luxurious {{passenger}} accommodation approached {{the standards of}} transatlantic liners. There were three decks. On the main deck was a smoking room with its own wet bar, a dining salon, and seating for the 66 passengers which could also be converted to sleeping berths for night flights. Aft of the passenger spaces was an all-electric galley, lavatories, and cargo hold. The cockpit, navigational office, engine control and radio rooms were on the upper deck. The lower deck held fuel tanks and nine watertight compartments, only seven of which were needed to provide full flotation. Similar to the later Boeing 314, the Do-X lacked conventional wing floats, instead using fuselage mounted [...] "stub wings" [...] to stabilize the craft in the water, which also doubled as an <b>embarkation</b> <b>platform</b> for passengers.|$|E
