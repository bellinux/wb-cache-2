40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Financial Accounting)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. The {{report of}} the <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> is of little or no value. There is {{uncertainty}} about {{the duties of the}} <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> where there are material omissions and mistakes in the accounting records and financial statements of the close corporation because the {{report of the}} <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> must only state that the financial statements are in agreement with the accounting records. Nowhere in the Close Corporation Act it is stated what the duties of the <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> are whether he is aware or not of such mistakes or omissions. The close corporation doesn't require the <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> to do an audit on the books and records of the close corporation, and the <b>accounting</b> <b>officers</b> are therefore under the impression that they may not be held liable for all the debts of the close corporation. The <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> is however vulnerable as his duties in terms of the Close Corporation Act are far reaching and he cannot fulfil his duties completely unless he has done an audit, and can therefore be held liable for the debts of the close corporation. He can further be held liable for the debts of the close corporation due to the following: 7. 1 the shortcomings in the Close Corporation Act nr. 69 of 1984; 7. 2 the impracticability of the Close Corporation Act; 7. 3 the vagueness and indistinctness of certain articles in the Act that the <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> must comply with or are exposed to; 7. 4 the <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> may use his professional judgment to investigate the accounting records of the close corporation, and nothing prohibits him to do so if he think it lit. If however he is of the opinion that {{it is not necessary to}} investigate the accounting records, this will contribute towards the <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> becoming liable for the debts of the close corporation, although the Act doesn't require the <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> to do an audit on the books and records of the close corporation. In the case where the <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> decides to investigate the books and records of the close corporation, his duties are extensive because he takes the decision to investigate. 7. 5 The <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> act in many cases as advisor/bookkeeper/ accountant for the CC, because of the size and nature of the entity, and by doing that, he then participates in the management of the CC and he is then vulnerable in terms of section 64 of the Close Corporation Act to be liable for all the debts of the corporation, without being the <b>accounting</b> <b>officer's</b> intention to participate in the management of the close corporation. 7. 6 The powers of the <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> are not fully addressed in the Close Corporation Act and the <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> is not properly protected by the Act. Because of the current Close Corporations Act, the interpretation and use thereof, the <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> is excessively vulnerable to creditors and third parties of the close corporation and he can be held liable for all the debts of the close corporation. Amendments and changes to the act are necessary to clarify the duties of the <b>accounting</b> <b>officer</b> and to get certainty about certain articles in the Act which are vague. Master...|$|R
