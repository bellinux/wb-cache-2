500|$|Girlfight {{was written}} and {{directed}} by Karyn Kusama, marking her feature film debut. Her aim was to subvert [...] "the classic boxing story" [...] with a female lead, having taken up boxing herself in 1992 at the famous Gleason's Gym in Brooklyn. After writing the script, she struggled to persuade production companies to finance the film; numerous producers suggested that Kusama cast a white woman in the lead role rather than a Latina and felt that having a female protagonist was [...] "unappealing [...] unbelievable". Maggie Renzi, Sarah Green and Martha Griffin eventually agreed to produce the film, and found a financier in 1999 to provide the $1 million (U.S.) budget. Two days before pre-production on the film was set to begin the financier backed out, but Renzi and her partner John Sayles—an independent filmmaker and Kusama's former mentor—decided to provide funding for the film's entire budget themselves. The Independent <b>Film</b> <b>Channel</b> later contributed $300,000 towards the budget.|$|E

500|$|The {{relationships}} between Betty and Rita, and Diane and Camilla have been variously described as [...] "touching," [...] "moving," [...] {{as well as}} [...] "titillating". Film critic Glenn Kenny, {{in a review of}} the film for Premiere, stated that the relationship between Betty and Rita is [...] "possibly the healthiest, most positive amorous relationship ever depicted in a Lynch movie", whereas the French critic Thierry Jousse, in his review for Cahiers du cinéma, noted that the love between the women depicted is [...] "of lyricism practically without equal in contemporary cinema". In the pages of Film Comment, Philip Lopate held that the pivotal romantic interlude between Betty and Rita was made so poignant and tender by Betty's [...] "understanding for the first time, with self-surprise, that all her helpfulness and curiosity about the other woman had a point: desire... It is a beautiful moment, made all the more miraculous by its earned tenderness, and its distances from anything lurid." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon magazine maintained that the scene's [...] "eroticism [...] so potent it blankets the whole movie, coloring every scene that came before and every one that follows". Betty and Rita were chosen by the Independent <b>Film</b> <b>Channel</b> as the emblematic romantic couple of the 2000s. Writer Charles Taylor states, [...] "Betty and Rita are often framed against darkness so soft and velvety it's like a hovering nimbus, ready to swallow them if they awake from the film's dream. And when they are swallowed, when smoke fills the frame as if the sulfur of hell itself were obscuring our vision, we feel as if not just a romance has been broken, but the beauty of the world has been cursed." [...] The co-dependency in the relationship between Betty and Rita–which borders on outright obsession–has been compared to the female relationships in two similar films, Ingmar Bergman's Persona (1966) and Robert Altman's 3 Women (1977), which also depict identities of vulnerable women that become tangled, interchanging and ultimately merge: [...] "The female couples also mirror each other, with their mutual interactions conflating hero(ine) worship with same-sex desire".|$|E
