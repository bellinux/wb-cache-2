25|$|Even though Switzerland is a EFTA member state, {{it is not}} {{a member}} of the European Economic Area. Switzerland has, however, {{generally}} adopted much of the harmonised EU legislation with regard to driving licences.

25|$|On January 1, 1991, {{commercial}} aviation in Europe was completely liberalized and the existing capacities {{led to an}} aggressive competition among the airlines. In a national referendum on December 6, 1992, Swiss citizens rejected {{taking part in the}} European Economic Area, EEA. This referendum was a significant disservice to Swissair, an airline with a minute domestic market: Its planes were not allowed to take up passengers during intermediate landings in <b>EEA</b> <b>countries</b> (e.g., Zurich – Frankfurt – New York), and Swissair was not allowed to offer tickets for sections that fully lie in EEA member countries (e.g., Zurich – Frankfurt – Paris).

This is implied in Directive 2004/38/EC, Article 5(2) provided that they travel together with the EEA national or join their spouse/partner {{at a later date}} (Article 6(2)). If the non-EEA family member has neither an EEA residence card nor a visa, but can show their family tie with the EU national by other means, then a visa must be issued at the border free of charge and entry permitted.|$|E

2500|$|From the 1880s, it {{has been}} a moot point whether the effect of such {{registration}} and protection of the title [...] "architect" [...] would be to place an undue burden on the profession for too little benefit for the public, or to confer an unfair advantage on the profession, or one section of it, as against competitors. But in more recent decades the statutory Register of Architects and the protection of the title [...] "architect" [...] under the legislation has been affected by the obligation of the Government to secure compliance with obligations in connection with membership of the European Union and the European Economic Area. This has brought in its train questions about the criteria and standards for deciding upon equivalence of professional qualifications in EU and <b>EEA</b> <b>countries,</b> and the legitimate expectations of those who have qualified.|$|E
