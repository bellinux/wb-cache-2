50|$|Virginia Lynch, {{an early}} {{advocate}} of <b>forensic</b> <b>nursing,</b> proposed {{creation of the}} <b>forensic</b> <b>nursing</b> specialty in 1986 and helped establish the first graduate studies program at the University of Texas at Arlington's School of Nursing. The American Academy of Forensic Sciences recognized the <b>forensic</b> <b>nursing</b> specialty in 1991 and the American Nurses Association followed in 1995.|$|E
50|$|<b>Forensic</b> <b>nursing</b> {{developed}} {{in response to}} concerns in the 1980s regarding the treatment of patients suffering from crime-related injuries and the proper handling of evidence. Globally, the development of general clinical forensic medicine and the <b>forensic</b> <b>nursing</b> have progressed at different speeds, with one preceding the other on a country-by-country basis. Founded in 1992, the International Association of Forensic Nurses is the primary professional association for <b>forensic</b> <b>nursing,</b> which as of 2011 included 2,000 members in 11 countries.|$|E
50|$|The {{specialized}} {{training that}} <b>forensic</b> <b>nurses</b> receive related {{to both the}} medical and legal needs of these patients drives demand for the specialty. Crime victims face {{a higher risk of}} post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicide, and medical complications than other patients; <b>forensic</b> <b>nurses</b> improve both legal outcomes and quality of life for these patients relative to standard Emergency Department care. <b>Forensic</b> <b>nurses</b> also assist in providing professional insight to potential causes of patient injuries in situations in which witnesses are unavailable.|$|R
50|$|<b>Forensic</b> <b>nurses</b> {{are also}} {{responsible}} for educating a patient {{on his or her}} rights. In the United States, for example, patients are not required to pursue legal action to receive a medical exam, and it is the <b>forensic</b> <b>nurse's</b> responsibility to discuss this with each patient.|$|R
50|$|Prior to {{beginning}} an exam, <b>forensic</b> <b>nurses</b> must receive consent from the patient. In addition to documenting obvious injuries, <b>forensic</b> <b>nurses</b> specialize {{in looking for}} subtle signs of assault, such as petechiae, voice changes, and loss of bowel or bladder function. <b>Forensic</b> <b>nurses</b> document patient injuries through tools including cameras, measuring tapes, fluid swabs, rape kits, and a high-powered light that can reveal hard-to-see bruises and fluids like semen, urine, or saliva. They document every injury for potential use as evidence in a later court case, where they may be called as an expert witness to testify to the injuries.|$|R

30|$|Nurses are {{responsible}} for evaluating patients in a comprehensive manner, identifying problems intervention to solve problems and recording when the patients come to the emergency services due to health problems. These duties of nurses are also applicable in forensics cases.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Within {{the nursing}} {{profession}} stress and burnout {{are considered to}} be widely present and problematic. These factors tend to impact negatively on job satisfaction and ultimately affect the retention of nurses. Psychiatric/mental health nursing as a specialty {{is considered to be a}} highly stressful environment; however, there is a paucity of research in this area. The current study adopted a survey design to compare <b>forensic</b> psychiatric <b>nurses</b> (n = 51) with psychiatric nurses from a mainstreamed mental health service (n = 78) in relation to burnout and job satisfaction. <b>Forensic</b> <b>nurses</b> displayed lower burnout and higher job satisfaction than their counterparts from the mainstreamed services. These findings are surprising in light of the image of <b>forensic</b> psychiatric <b>nursing</b> as dangerous and unpredictable...|$|R

A national survey of freonsc psychiatric services in the UK was conducted, and information gathered on the perceived skills and competencies in this growing field of psychiatric practice. From 3360 questionnaires, 1172 were returned making a response rate of 35 %. The results indicate a small discrepancy between forensic nurses' and non-forensic nurses' perceptions of the role constructs of forensic practice. However, a larger difference was noted between nurses'perceptions and other disciplines' perceptions of the constituent parts to <b>forensic</b> psychiatric <b>nursing.</b> Nurses tend ed to focus on personal qualities both in relation to themselves and th epatients, while the other disciplines focused on organizational structures both in defining the role and in the resolution of perceived deficits.

50|$|Before {{there was}} a {{specialty}} recognized as <b>forensic</b> <b>nursing,</b> the term used was clinical forensic medicine. This term describes the use of clinical practices to support judicial proceedings to protect a victim, usually after death has occurred. It {{was not until the}} late 20th century that medical professionals wanted more collaboration between the medical and legal systems. In the United States this problem began to be addressed. A strong advocate for the <b>forensic</b> <b>nursing</b> specialty in United States was Virginia Lynch. She pushed to have the specialty recognized and helped to form programs in the U.S. for proper education. In the 1980s articles were being written about how the important evidence needed to build a legal case was not being preserved during the treatment of a victim. From there began an explanation of the nurse’s role in not just forensic medicine but also the criminal justice system when dealing with a victim of violence.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>forensic</b> <b>nursing</b> can {{be traced}} back to the 1980s for the {{development}} of the specialty, it can be noted that the foundation may have been laid as early as the 18th century. Certain medical professionals were involved in court cases that involved crimes like rape. These medical professionals began to move these issues from a simply criminal justice view to a more recognized health concern.|$|E

40|$|In {{their daily}} work, {{psychiatric}} nurses {{are subjected to}} patient-perpetrated verbal and physical aggression. They manage {{a high level of}} work stress. As compared to their colleagues working in civil settings, <b>forensic</b> psychiatric <b>nurses</b> may experience different rates of patient aggression and work stress. Such experiences have implications for the mental health and productivity of nursing staff. In inpatient settings, homicide by a patient is a rare event. Representing the most severe form of patient aggression, patient homicide may be expected to have significant effects on the psychological well-being of psychiatric nurses. The present cross-sectional study comprised two separate phases. The broad aims of the first phase were to explore and compare the psychological well-being of civil and <b>forensic</b> hospital-based psychiatric <b>nurses</b> and to uncover factors contributing to and buffering against the development of posttraumatic stress reactions and general distress. Owing to the occurrence of a double patient homicide in a forensic psychiatric hospital where this study was underway, the study was expanded to include a second phase. The broad aims of the second phase were to evaluate the effects of patient homicide, on posttraumatic stress reactions and general distress in <b>forensic</b> psychiatric <b>nurses,</b> both working across the entire hospital and working on the unit where the patient homicide occurred. In the first phase, a battery of self-report measures was administered to 97 <b>forensic</b> psychiatric <b>nurses</b> in a <b>forensic</b> psychiatric hospital and 99 civil psychiatric nurses across three civil hospitals. In {{the second phase of the}} study, a slightly modified questionnaire was re-administered to 107 <b>forensic</b> <b>nurses</b> from the same forensic psychiatric hospital, five months after the occurrence of patient homicide. Multiple regression analyses indicated that while working in a civil setting is a risk factor for reporting higher levels of work stress, civil and <b>forensic</b> <b>nurses</b> experience similar psychological well-being and demonstrate comparable coping strategies and attitudes. As a group, 14 - 17 % of civil and <b>forensic</b> <b>nurses</b> met diagnostic criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 36 % scored above the threshold for psychiatric caseness. A tentative model of the development of posttraumatic stress reactions and general distress was developed, illustrating that frequency of aggression and level of work stress have direct effects on both posttraumatic stress reactions and general distress. The moderating roles of coping strategies, attitude to personality disorder and attitude towards patient aggression were also highlighted in the model. Following the occurrence of patient homicide, <b>forensic</b> <b>nurses</b> in general demonstrated resilience, not displaying increased (or decreased) symptoms of posttraumatic stress or general distress. In comparison, there were trends for higher proportions of nurses working on the unit where the homicide occurred to meet criteria for PTSD and to score above the threshold for psychiatric caseness after the patient homicide, as compared to before the homicide. The present study affirms that psychiatric nursing is a challenging and stressful occupation and highlights risk factors for poor psychological well-being in mental health nurses. Limitations of the study, implications for employers and individual nurses, and directions for future research are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Specialised {{areas of}} nursing have {{developed}} {{in response to}} the needs of society. This study evolved {{due to a lack of}} understanding and knowledge about the role of a Clinical <b>Forensic</b> Nurse/ <b>Nurse</b> Practitioner by members of the health profession, law enforcement agencies and the general public as well as the potential scope of practice for this occupation. A Grounded Theory approach has been used, utilising contributions from nurses, doctors and others involved in the care of forensic clients across Australia. Clinical <b>Forensic</b> <b>Nurses</b> work in hospitals, clinics and the community but often in isolation from other <b>forensic</b> <b>nurses.</b> Grounded theory was selected because it is useful when little is known or experienced about a situation and is able to identify factors that may define and explain this evolving sub-speciality. Subjects from various positions within Departments of Emergency Medicine, Medical Forensic Units and the State Police Force gave their consent to participate. They were located in various states and territories of Australia and one was employed as a lecturer at a major tertiary institution. The participants were diverse yet had the common characteristic of being employed in clinical forensic practice. Data collection involved interviews, observation and document analysis. Using constant comparative analysis, the findings identified a number of barriers and opportunities for the role of the Clinical <b>Forensic</b> <b>Nurse</b> Practitioner in Australia. Social change and demands have historically informed changes to the roles of nurses in Australia. As society changes and demands on the present health care delivery develop different emphasis, there is potential for increased frequency of providing care for and supporting victims and perpetrators of crime that have legal and forensic implications ‘on the front line’ of care. This care is developed on informed decision making so that the patients’ health, civil, legal and human rights are met.
