5|$|United States: In November 2013, the United States {{employed}} {{an industrial}} rock crusher to pulverize six tons of amassed ivory. Although the US does not ban the <b>domestic</b> <b>sale</b> of ivory, {{it is illegal}} to bring ivory into the country. Its interest in destroying its ivory was also connected to research that found links between the ivory trade and threats to national security through terrorism and organized crime. The US government and American non-governmental organizations have been involved in multiple forms of anti-poaching measures, largely in Africa, and American diplomats are actively engaging other governments to take part in eroding the ivory market by destroying stockpiles. Another ivory crush took place in New York City's Times Square in June 2015.|$|E

40|$|Using panel data on six Chinese {{manufacturing}} industries {{over the}} period 2005 – 2007, this article explores the interrelationship among foreign presence, <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> and export intensity of local firms. We find that the <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> and exports are complementary for local firms in China’s pharmaceutical industry, whereas {{in the case of}} the textile, transportation equipment, beverage, communication equipment and general equipment manufacturing industries, <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> and exports are substitutes. An increase in the average <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> increases foreign presence in all industries. The same applies to an increase in the average export intensity. An increase in the level of competition in China’s textile industry increases the export intensity as well as <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> of local textile firms. However, an increase in the level of competition in the pharmaceutical industry leads to a very large decrease in export intensity of local pharmaceutical firms. In the case of China’s transportation equipment manufacturing industry, an increase in the level of competition decreases <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> of local firms. Furthermore, an increase in the firm size increases <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> of Chinese firms in all six manufacturing industries...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} and quantifies {{the impact}} on <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> of being an exporter. It is widely assumed that exporters sell in domestic market more than non-exporters, among other important features. However, export participation also slows the growth rates of <b>domestic</b> <b>sales.</b> We will refer to this fall in <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> growth as residual export. The empirical analysis uses Spanish microdata provided by the Encuesta Sobre Estrategias Empresariales (ESEE) for the period 1990 - 2011 in a difference-in-difference model. This method compares <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> before and after entry in exporting for two time periods and for two groups of firms: exporters and non-exporters. The results confirm that participation in export activities slows down <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> growth significantly, although the amount of this result varies when we distinguish between different types of firms according to their persistence as exporter. ...|$|R

40|$|How do firms' sales {{interact}} across markets? Are {{foreign and}} <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> complements or substitutes? Using a large French firm-level database that combine balance-sheet and product-destination-specific export information {{over the period}} 1995 - 2001, we study the interconnections between exports and <b>domestic</b> <b>sales.</b> We identify exogenous shocks that affect firm demand on foreign markets to instrument yearly variations in exports.

40|$|We {{present and}} test a model {{relating}} a firm's idiosyncratic cost, its exporting status, and the volatilities of its <b>domestic</b> and export <b>sales.</b> In prior models of trade, supply costs for domestic and exports were linear and thus additively separable. We introduce a nonlinear cost function {{in order to}} link the domestic and export supply costs. This theoretical contribution has two new implications for the exporting firm. First, the demand volatility in the foreign market now directly affects the firm's <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> volatility. Second, firms hedge domestic demand volatility with exports. The model has several testable predictions. First, larger firms have lower total and <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> volatilities. Second, foreign market volatility increases <b>domestic</b> <b>sales</b> volatilities for exporters. Third, exporters allocate output across both markets {{in order to reduce}} total sales volatility. We find evidence for these predictions with Danish firms operating between 1992 and 2006. ...|$|R
