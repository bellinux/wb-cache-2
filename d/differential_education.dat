40|$|This paper investigates {{movements}} in relative wages and wage inequality across thirteen of the world's major economies. Focusing on wages received by full-time male workers, the investigation uncovers several empirical regularities: (1) Most advanced industrialized economies show increases, often large. in wage inequality during the 19805; none show declining wage inequality. In contrast. {{three of four}} middle income countries considered here show sharply declining wage inequality during the 1980 s. (2) Since the early to late 19705, the advanced economies show large and persistent increases in the wages of prime age men relative to the wages of less experienced men. (3) Following a period of sharply declining <b>education</b> <b>differentials</b> in the 1970 s, the advanced economies show rising or flat <b>education</b> <b>differentials</b> after 1980. <b>Education</b> <b>differentials</b> fell moderately to sharply in the middle income countries during the 1980 s. (4) Wage inequality among observationally similar workers rose sharply during the 1980 s in most advanced economies. (5) After 1915, the structure of relative industry wages in the manufacturing sector became increasingly dissimilar across the advanced economies. However. controlling for common time effects, increases in international trade as a fraction of GOP {{are associated with a}} partial convergence of relative industry wage structures across countries. The paper discusses several alternative interpretations of wage structure developments in the United States and other countries in the light of these empirical regularities. ...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to evaluate the effects of a six week residential summer program of <b>differential</b> <b>education</b> for gifted high school students. It was designed {{to determine the extent to}} which participants in the program were proficient in aspects of critical and creative thinking, and in the ability to maintain an open mind and adjust to the stress imposed by constant environmental change. One hundred eight-five scholars from a parent population of 547 who met the selection requirements for the program participated in the project. Two hundred and fifty students from the parent population were selected to serve as a control group of Promethean Alternates who did not participate in the project. Participants, referred to as Promethean Scholars, took part in an intensive, interwoven matrix of experiences involving interdisciplinary classes of timely significance, small group seminars on topics concerning conflicts in American culture, lecture-demonstrations and addresses from prominent national figures keyed to seminar topics, and a tremendous diversity of evening cultural experiences and weekend field experiences. Promethean Scholars and Promethean Alternates were tested prior to initiation of the program to establish covariance controls for intelligence and academic ability. Final testing was conducted at the end of the project, with an additional evaluation by means of a teacher questionnaire administered one academic year after the termination of the project. Data used in this study were obtained from four tests. They were: Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal, Form YM, Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, Form A, Dogmatism Scale, Form E, Test of Behavioral Rigidity. The following conclusions were drawn from the data analyzed in this investigation. 1. Critical thinking abilities of Promethean Scholars were significantly greater (. 01) than those of Promethean Alternates. 2. Creative thinking abilities of Promethean Scholars were not significantly greater than those of Promethean Alternates. 3. Promethean Scholars were significantly less dogmatic (. 01) than Promethean Alternates. 4. Promethean Scholars exhibited significantly less behavioral rigidity (. 01) than Promethean Alternates. 5. On the basis of a questionnaire administered one year after participation, Promethean Scholars exhibited significantly greater critical thinking abilities (. 01), creative thinking abilities (. 01), love of learning (. 05), and tolerance of ambiguity (. 05) than did Promethean Alternates. No significant difference was noted in understanding of self, social conscience, leadership, quantity and quality of production, or response to challenge. 6.

To this end, this study compares the empirical validity of four influential theories concerning such a relationship in Japan: cultural capital theory, relative risk aversion hypothesis, the Wisconsin model, and tracking hypothesis. The results, utilizing nationally collected data, show the following: (1) both academic grade and ambition/aspiration {{have a significant effect on}} divergence of stratified pathways in high school and higher education; (2) parental education and occupation have a minimal effect on both academic grade and ambition/aspiration; (3) in the transition to higher education for males, the pathways in high school have an impact on the pathways in higher education; and (4) in the transition to high school and higher education for females, ambition/aspiration has a direct effect on diverging pathways, albeit with a weak tracking effect.

School systems diverged by racial group, with large funding and curriculum differences (Fiske and Ladd, 2004). In 1994, spending on white learners was about 1. 5 times the spending on urban African learners and {{more than four times}} the spending on rural African learners (Fiske and Ladd, 2004). Since 1994 much focus has been paid by government to redress these educational expenditure inequalities with policies such as the National Norms and Standards for School Funding (NNSSF) and the rollout of the no fee schools program disproportionately allocating state funds to low socioeconomic schools and the fee‐exemption policy providing low income households and grant recipients access to free education. Little is however known about how these policies have affected household educational expenditure across the income distribution.

It focuses on the relevance of the role adopted by teachers as they mediate differential learning processes and promote the local appropriation of the project. The school project claims the Indigenous Peoples’ right to create their own educational systems, and questions traditional school forms as well as the processes of historic acculturation, assimilation and exclusion of the indigenous peoples through governmental education policy. Through the implementation of research projects as learning strategies, the project pretends to foster the recognition of indigenous epistemologies and to create relevant and situated learning processes, promoting the participation of local actors and the dialogue with their knowledges, as well as the exploration of science and different cultural spaces. The project’s teachers become intermediaries and agents of a <b>differential</b> <b>education</b> proposal, being confronted with the need of redefining their own ethnic and professional identities.

Right- and left-hand performance did not differ {{for any of the}} groups although a significant age difference in overall performance of hearing subjects was found. The former result calls into question the validity of Witelson’s task. HEMISPHERIC specialization of function in the normal adult brain has been well documented. One of the experimental paradigms developed to index right hemisphere specialization is WITELSON’S [I, 21 dichhaptic task. The present study employed this paradigm to index hemispheric specialization in specific populations. Witelson’s dichhaptic task requires bilateral simultaneous tactual exploration of pairs of nonsense shapes, followed by subsequent visual recognition of the two shapes. WITEWN [2] argued that such a task would produce competition in the neural system such that any superiority {{of the right}} hemisphere for the required cognitive processing would be reflected in superior perception of the contralateral (left) hand stimuli. She found that right-handed boys demonstrated a left-hand superiority-indicative of right-hemisphere specialit-ation-as early as age 6 yr.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to address the impact of the {{subjective}} evaluation of job 	 characteristics on voluntary mobility, the impact of voluntary mobility on changes in these job 	 characteristics, and <b>differential</b> <b>education</b> and gender patterns. 	 Design/methodology/approach – Ordered and multinominal logistic regression analysis and 	 longitudinal panel analysis. 	 Findings – Dissatisfaction with one’s wage, the match between job content and personal capacities, 	 working hours, and the job in general cause voluntary external mobility. The latter two also increase 	 the odds of voluntary internal mobility. Voluntary internal and external mobility in turn decreases 	 dissatisfaction with several job characteristics. The higher the educational level, the weaker the impact 	 of dissatisfaction with working hours on voluntary internal mobility. For women, wage dissatisfaction 	 has a stronger impact on voluntary external mobility than for men. Moreover, dissatisfaction with the 	 number of working hours and the job in general more often cause voluntary internal mobility for 	 women than for men. The revenues of changing positions within or between firms, however, do not 	 substantially differ across education and gender. 	 Originality/value – This paper shows that subjectively evaluated job characteristics are important 	 push factors and result in voluntary mobility, and in some cases for women to a stronger degree than 	 for men. Even though it could be expected that returns to voluntary mobility are lower for women and 	 lower educated individuals, they do not differ substantially from the returns that men and higher 	 educated workers receive. ...|$|E

Earnings <b>differentials</b> across <b>education</b> and age groups remained roughly stable, and there was no general widening of earnings <b>differentials</b> within either <b>education</b> or age groups. German wage setting institutions tend to limit earnings differentials across groups of workers, but differences in wage setting institutions cannot fully explain the differences between trends in earnings inequality in Germany and those in the United States.

40|$|Thesis (MEd) [...] PU vir CHOGod created man in His {{own image}} and {{therefore}} as His co-worker. He is under obligation to create culture {{in accordance with}} God's law to which the entire reality is subjected. Being free of sin man's heart, and thereby his complete existence, was religiously directed to service to and glorification of God. But then man wanted {{to be more than}} an image, he wanted to be God Himself. As a result of his falling into sin his heart has fallen away from God and only by redemption in Christ can the harmony be restored. The image of God in him has however not been destroyed so that his divine calling to perform his cultural assignment has never ever stopped. This fact makes education possible. Educational didactics, which major aim is the supplying of knowledge, plays an important part in the orientation of the heart or ego which on its turn finds expression in the totality of man's temporal modal functions. As a result of his religion man has to choose an Origin – either for or against God. But to fulfil his Christian calling, in his personal life and as a member of society, he has no other choice than the acception of divine guidance as his personal credo. Only in obedience to Gods laws Christian culture can be created. But because his act-life functions intentionally, man personally stays responsible for his way of living. Like every creature every human being possesses an individual and temporal structure so that educational didactics should provide for the individual and <b>differential</b> <b>education</b> to the modal functions gradually from the less to the most complicated - faith.
