5|$|The game is {{presented}} from a single, 2D perspective, {{and the main}} objective involves Charlie the Chef baking a cake from evil, sentient ingredients. The five ingredients vary from Mixed Peel, Chunky Chocolate, Crafty Cheese, Sneaky Sugar and Colonel Custard, who will all <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the pantry and try and avoid the player whenever possible.|$|E
5|$|Like the spinner shark, the blacktip shark {{is known}} to leap {{out of the water}} and spin three or four times about its axis before landing. Some of these jumps are the end product of feeding runs, in which the shark corkscrews {{vertically}} through schools of small fish and its momentum launches it into the air. Observations in the Bahamas suggest that blacktip sharks may also <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the water to dislodge attached sharksuckers (Echeneis naucrates), which irritate the shark's skin and compromise its hydrodynamic shape. The speed attained by the shark during these jumps has been estimated to average 6.3m/s (21ft/s).|$|E

When Steinman's manager saw it, he responded 'It's a porno movie!' The two-day shoot ran over schedule and budget, costing £35,000 an hour. Russell and Steinman even designed a sequence where a motorcyclist would cycle up the steps of a local church-tower, <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the turrets at the top, and then explode; alas, the wardens of the church refused permission.|$|E
5|$|The train heist {{presented}} several challenges. The filmmakers {{were required}} to effectively purchase a length of working railroad for filming and the trains necessary to ride the tracks. Then trucks had to be built that could race the train and {{meet the needs of}} the heist itself. Lin also required that the cars being carried on the train be able to <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the train at full speed. The scene took precise execution. The filmmakers chose to use cars they could cheaply replicate for the train heist—a 1972 De Tomaso Pantera, a 2007 Chevrolet Corvette GS Roadster, and a Ford GT40—to avoid the expense of replacing a genuine $2 million Ford GT40.|$|E
5|$|They then {{discover}} {{that they are in}} the sheriff's home, who returns soon after. Peter tries to pretend to be his wife while hiding in a closet, and he convinces the sheriff to let the fugitives go free. This exchange ends with the sheriff asking for a hug, which makes Peter <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the closet and reveal the group. The entire police force then comes after them, until they are able to jump on a train and arrive in Quahog, only to be met by the sheriff and his deputies. Joe, however, had called ahead and arranged for the Quahog police department to arrive and rescue them. Joe then smashes the sheriff's vehicle, shoots him in the leg, and demands he leave Quahog.|$|E

25|$|Belugas are slower {{swimmers}} {{than the}} other toothed whales, such as the killer whale and the common bottlenose dolphin, because they are less hydrodynamic and have limited movement of their tailfins, which produce the greatest thrust. They frequently swim at between , although {{they are able to}} maintain a speed of 22km/h for up to 15 min. Unlike most cetaceans, they are capable of swimming backwards. Belugas swim on the surface between 5% and 10% of the time, while {{for the rest of the}} time they swim at a depth sufficient to cover their bodies.

25|$|Although the Cholas did not {{established}} a direct rule over Srivijayan court, Chola nobles were accepted graciously in Srivijayan court. In 1067 CE, a Chola prince named Divakara or Devakala was sent as a Srivijayan {{ambassador to the}} Imperial Court of China. The prince who was the nephew of Rajendra Chola later was enthroned in 1070 CE as Kulothunga Chola I. The humiliating defeat of Srivijayan Mandala against foreign invasion, has exposed the weaknesses and vurnerability of Srivijayan allegiance and alliance model. Among the disillusioned regional polities that <b>jump</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the wagon, Kedah was the first that rebelled against the central Srivijayan authority. As the response, Srivijaya asked the Chola's help to punish and suppress Kedah rebellion. In 1068 CE, Virarajendra Chola launched a naval raid to help Srivijaya reclaim Kedah. Virarajendra reinstated the Kedah king {{at the request of}} the Srivijayan Maharaja and Kedah accepted the Srivijayan sovereignty. After this the Chola ruler Kulothunga Chola I became the ruler of Srivijaya which is mentioned in the Song chronicles. This peculiar event and the strange dynamic between Srivijaya and its former nemesis, the Cholas, has confused the Chinese court, that in their report mistakenly thought that the Chola was the vassal of Srivijaya.|$|E

500|$|Luxating patella {{is another}} health {{issue in the}} Pomeranian breed.
