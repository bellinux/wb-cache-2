5|$|Belton House {{remained}} relatively untouched during this period, largely {{owing to the}} failing fortunes of the Brownlow family. The 3rd Earl Brownlow and his Countess lived {{for only a few}} months of the year at Belton, where they came for the fox-hunting, and divided the remainder of their time between their house in London and Ashridge, another country house in Hertfordshire. Ashridge, a huge Gothic revival pile, had come to the Brownlows in the 19th century through the Egerton family. It was sold, with its art collection and furnishings, to pay the <b>death</b> <b>duties</b> arising on the death of the 3rd Earl in 1921. Hence Belton became the Brownlows' sole country home. Further <b>death</b> <b>duties</b> were incurred in 1927 on the death of the 3rd Earl's successor, his second cousin Adelbert Cust, 5th Baron Brownlow.|$|E
5|$|Cleeve Abbey {{was passed}} {{back to the}} Crown in 1950–51 to pay <b>Death</b> <b>Duties</b> on the Luttrell estate and was managed by the Department for the Environment. Major {{restoration}} and archaeological work followed. In 1984, English Heritage took over responsibility for Cleeve Abbey, carrying out excavations and earthwork surveys and continues to care for it today.|$|E
5|$|Alexander died in 1944, and the <b>death</b> <b>duties</b> proved {{crippling}} to Geoffrey. In 1949 he {{sold the}} castle and 3,480 hectares (8,600acres) of the lands to the Ashdale Property Company, retaining a tenancy of the castle for himself. The Crown Estate bought the estate from Ashdale and sold the castle back to Geoffrey in 1954. His son Colonel Walter Luttrell lived away from Dunster, and {{following the death of}} his mother– the last Luttrell to live in the property– gave the castle and most of its contents to the National Trust in 1976.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the death}} of Alexander Luttrell in 1944, the family was unable to afford the <b>death</b> <b>duties</b> on his estate. The castle and {{surrounding}} lands were sold off to a property firm, the family continuing {{to live in the}} castle as tenants. The Luttrells bought back the castle in 1954, but in 1976 Colonel Walter Luttrell gave Dunster Castle and most of its contents to the National Trust, which operates it as a tourist attraction. It is a Grade I listed building and scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|Further {{repairs to}} Stokesay Castle were {{required}} in 1902, {{carried out by}} Allcroft's heir, Hebert, {{with help from the}} Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. The Allcroft family faced increasing financial difficulty in the 20th century and the castle was formally opened for visitors in 1908, with much of the revenue reinvested in the property, but funds for repairs remained in short supply. By the 1930s the Allcroft estate was in serious financial difficulties, and the payment of two sets of <b>death</b> <b>duties</b> in 1946 and 1950 added to the family's problems.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, the John, {{the fifth}} Marquess, {{inherited}} the castle {{on the death}} of his father and faced considerable <b>death</b> <b>duties.</b> He sold the very last of the Bute lands in Cardiff and gave the castle and the surrounding park to the city on behalf of the people of Cardiff; the family flag was taken down from the castle as part of the official hand-over ceremony. The castle was protected as a grade I listed building and as a scheduled monument.|$|E

50|$|Pitt owned a {{piece of}} land called a copyhold, and the lord of this land was {{entitled}} to Pitt's most valuable possession after his death. If he had not sold the diamond, it would have been confiscated as a heriot, a form of <b>death</b> <b>duty.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{his later}} life, Richard Gibbs {{recognised}} that the diverse {{interests of the}} large family, {{and the need to}} invest heavily in even basic refurbishment of the house to make it weather-secured and habitable, would require the family to sell Tyntesfield. Recognising also that substantial <b>death</b> <b>duties</b> would become payable on his death, Richard drew up a will based around a trust that would allow his fortune to pass to the surviving children of his brother and half sister, a total of 19 beneficiaries.|$|E
5|$|In {{recognition}} of the help France gave to the Duke and Duchess in providing them with a home, and in lieu of <b>death</b> <b>duties,</b> the Duchess's collection of Louis XVI style furniture, some porcelain, and paintings were made over to the French state. The British royal family received no major bequests. Most of her estate went to the Pasteur Institute medical research foundation, on the instructions of Suzanne Blum. The decision took the royal family and the Duchess's friends by surprise, as she had shown little interest in charity during her life.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money {{restoring}} Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and <b>death</b> <b>duties</b> which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.|$|E

5000|$|Feudal {{relief was}} a one-off [...] "fine" [...] or form of {{taxation}} payable to an overlord by the heir of a feudal tenant to license {{him to take}} possession of his fief, i.e. an estate-in-land, by inheritance. It is comparable to a <b>death</b> <b>duty</b> or inheritance tax.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1990s the {{character}} {{had only a}} handful of appearances, most prominent of which was a graphic novel, Night Raven: House of Cards. The character's first American appearance was in a supporting role in the graphic novel Fury/Black Widow: <b>Death</b> <b>Duty.</b> In <b>Death</b> <b>Duty,</b> it is revealed that he is unable to die. Night Raven's immortality was contradicted later in the 1995 Marvel US miniseries Nocturne, in which it was revealed that the original Night Raven had died after being poisoned in the 1950s. One of his last acts was to create a battlesuit which was later donned by Graham [...] "Gray" [...] Poldark to become a new hero known as Nocturne. It has since been confirmed that the Nocturne story did not take place in the main Marvel comics reality.|$|R
5|$|The 9th Earl of Shaftesbury, {{prior to}} his death, {{invested}} and arranged financial matters so that his heirs would avoid <b>death</b> <b>duties.</b> When his grandfather died, the newly titled 10th Earl of Shaftesbury came into a vast fortune of the Shaftesbury estates and other properties, including the family's 17th-century home and large estate in Dorset, as well as residences in Hove, London, Versailles and the French Riviera. Shaftesbury also inherited a collection of art, antiques, and other valuables worth over £3m. By the 1990s, {{the wealth of the}} family estate remained well worth millions.|$|E
5|$|The castle was not {{demolished}} {{as planned}} and instead {{was purchased by}} Mary Bonham-Christie for £125,000 later that year. She decided {{to live in a}} nearby house rather than the castle itself, allowing the island to return to nature and the castle to fall into disrepair. By the time of Bonham-Christie's death in 1961 the roof had partially collapsed and a tree was growing up through the centre of the building. Facing large <b>death</b> <b>duties,</b> Bonham-Christie's grandson put the island up for sale, before agreeing to donate it to the state in lieu of taxes.|$|E
5|$|The {{payment of}} <b>death</b> <b>duties</b> and the {{difficulty}} of maintaining a large estate during the Second World War forced the Cubitt family to begin selling packets of land. Cubitt's mansion was abandoned until its demolition in 1953, by which time the family was living in a Regency-style house converted from the housing that had been provided for the garden and stable staff in more affluent times.|$|E
50|$|After his death, he paid £506,159 gross <b>death</b> <b>duty,</b> and bequeathed £250 each to the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, the Royal Commonwealth Society, the Liverpool Conservative Association, and the Rankin Boys Club.

50|$|An {{estate duty}} (or {{inheritance}} tax) {{is a tax}} levied on the estate of a deceased person in many jurisdictions or on the inheritance of a person.

5|$|As {{his wealth}} grew, Moore {{began to worry}} about his legacy. With {{the help of his}} {{daughter}} Mary, he set up the Henry Moore Trust in 1972, with a view to protecting his estate from <b>death</b> <b>duties.</b> By 1977, he was paying close to a million pounds a year in income tax; to mitigate his tax burden, he established the Henry Moore Foundation as a registered charity with Irina and Mary as trustees. The Foundation was established to encourage the public appreciation of the visual arts and especially the works of Moore. It now runs his house and estate at Perry Green, with a gallery, sculpture park and studios.|$|E
5|$|Still ruined, Bowes Castle was {{reclaimed}} by the Crown in 1361; between 1444 and 1471 it {{was controlled}} by the Neville family, powerful regional landowners, before reverting to the Crown once again. James I sold the castle in the early 17th century and the remaining fortifications were dismantled in the mid-17th century after the English Civil War. By 1928, the castle was in a poor condition, with little interest being shown in it from locals or its owner, Lady Lorna Curzon-Howe. Facing <b>death</b> <b>duties</b> on her estate, Curzon-Howe agreed to pass the castle into {{the care of the}} Office of Works in 1931.|$|E
5|$|The house {{remained}} in the Portman family until 1944 when it was accepted in lieu of <b>death</b> <b>duties</b> by the Crown Estate, however Mrs Portman remained at the house until her death in 1951. It was leased to the fire service in 1953. A visitor centre opened in the Victorian stables in 2005. Most {{of the cost of}} the conversion was funded by a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund. The house was used as the Emergency Call Centre for the Somerset Area of Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service with a running cost in 2011 of £675,000 per year. The fire service moved out in 2012 and restoration work was then undertaken.|$|E

50|$|English law has {{legal fiction}} that {{in cases where}} the order of death is indeterminable, the eldest is {{recorded}} to have died first.

5000|$|Hardy died {{of natural}} causes on 30 May 1958 in Hammersmith, London. He was buried on 5 June at Wells Church, Norfolk leaving an estate of £57,000, on which £19,000 <b>death</b> <b>duty</b> taxes were paid. In the {{foreword}} for Hardy's autobiography I Escape!, Conan Doyle pays tribute to Hardy, stating that a [...] "more gallant gentleman never lived." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{house was}} built and added to over many years. The great hall and chapel block are the {{earliest}} surviving parts of the structure with the west wing being added around 1570, when the windows and decoration {{of the rest of}} the building were changed. Further construction and adaptation was undertaken in the 18th century when it was owned by the Elton baronets. The house was acquired by the nation and was given to the National Trust in part-payment for <b>death</b> <b>duties</b> in 1960. The Elton family is still resident in the house, which is now open to the public.|$|E
5|$|The {{next and}} last {{residents}} of the house were Gilbert and Esme Smyth. They lived there for the next thirty years. Gilbert died in a 1940 and Esme in 1946 {{and the house was}} left to their daughter Esme Francis Cavendish. She and her husband tried to sell the house immediately in 1946 to help pay the <b>death</b> <b>duties.</b> However the Cavendish family did not succeed until thirteen years later in 1959 during which time the house was unoccupied and started to decay. It was sold at this time to Bristol City Council who still owns it today.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} period many {{thousands}} of country houses of great architectural value were demolished, or had whole wings razed to the ground. In 1955 alone one house was demolished every five days. In this respect Belton was fortunate to survive at all, as {{in addition to the}} family's problems, the house deteriorated {{to such an extent that}} in 1961 the 6th Baron employed the architect Francis Johnson to oversee a large restoration program lasting three years. Not only was the roof repaired but much of the panelling taken down and repaired, and new cornices installed. Also attempts were made to curtail serious infestations of dry rot. By the time of the death of the 6th Baron in 1978, the resultant <b>death</b> <b>duties,</b> coupled with the rising costs of the upkeep, made Belton too much for the Brownlow family.|$|E

50|$|Capital Gains Tax (CGT) in {{the context}} of the Australian {{taxation}} system applies to the capital gain made on disposal of any asset, except for specific exemptions.
