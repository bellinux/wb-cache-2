30|$|Interference {{from various}} technogenic (man-made) sources, unintentional {{as well as}} intentional, {{typically}} has temporal and/or amplitude structure, and its amplitude distribution is usually non-Gaussian. A simplified explanation of the non-Gaussian (and often impulsive) nature of a technogenic noise produced by digital electronics and communication systems can be as follows. An idealized discrete-level (digital) signal {{can be viewed as}} a linear combination of <b>Heaviside</b> <b>unit</b> <b>step</b> functions ([36], for example). Since the derivative of the <b>Heaviside</b> <b>unit</b> <b>step</b> function is the Dirac δ-function ([37], for example), the derivative of an idealized digital signal is a linear combination of Dirac δ-functions, which is a limitlessly impulsive signal with zero interquartile range and infinite peakedness. The derivative of a ‘real’ (i.e., no longer idealized) digital signal can thus be viewed as a convolution of a linear combination of Dirac δ-functions with a continuous kernel. If the kernel is sufficiently narrow (for example, the bandwidth is sufficiently large), the resulting signal will appear as an impulse train protruding from a continuous background signal. Thus, impulsive interference occurs naturally in digital electronics as “ di/dt” (inductive) noise or as the result of the coupling (for example, capacitive) between various circuit components and traces, leading to the so-called ‘platform noise’ ([39], for example).|$|E

We expect to find a curve dividing the harmonic (Δu = 0) region from the superharmonic (Δu = −λ) region, defined by the equation u(x, y) = 1.

We use the implicit function theorem to study the effect of perturbation of the boundary conditions on known families of solutions.

The treatment is essentially an extension to supersonic flow of the treatment given in NACA report 1234 for subsonic flow. For the supersonic case the Kernel function is derived by use of a suitable form of acoustic doublet potential which employs a cutoff or <b>Heaviside</b> <b>unit</b> function. The Kernel functions are reduced to forms that can be accurately evaluated by considering the functions in two parts: a part in which the singularities are isolated and analytically expressed, and a nonsingular part which can be tabulated...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} a {{numerical}} analysis of the electro-mechanical response of piezoelectric sensors subjected to an external non-uniform displacement field. The meshless method based on the local Petrov-Galerkin (MLPG) approach is utilized for the numerical solution of a boundary value problem for the coupled electro-mechanical fields that characterize the piezoelectric material. The sensor is modeled as a 3 -D piezoelectric solid. The transient effects are not considered. Using the present MLPG approach, the assumed solid of the cylindrical shape is discretized with nodal points only, and a small spherical subdomain is introduced around each nodal point. Local integral equations constructed from the weak form of governing PDEs are defined over these local subdomains. A moving least-squares (MLS) approximation scheme is used to approximate the spatial variations of the unknown field variables, and the <b>Heaviside</b> <b>unit</b> <b>step</b> function {{is used as a}} test function. The electric field induced on the sensor is studied in a numerical example for two loading scenarios...|$|E

The {{finite element method}} with four node plate element and the extended Hamilton principle were used to derive the governing equation. The effects of actuator debonding on the smart composite laminate were investigated in both the frequency and time domains. The frequency and transient responses were obtained using the mode superposition method and the Newmark time integration algorithm, respectively. Two partial actuator debonding cases were studied to investigate the debonding effects on the actuation capability of the piezoelectric actuator. The effect of actuator debonding on the natural frequencies was subtler, but severe reductions of the actuation ability were observed in both the frequency and time responses, especially in the edge debonded actuator case. The results provided confirmation that the proposed modeling {{could be used in}} virtual experiments of actuator failure in smart composite laminates.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in neurobiology remains understanding the relationship between complex neural network dynamics underlying spatially structured activity states and the corresponding neural circuitry for which the electromagnetic field is macroscopically measurable via electroencephalogram (EEG) or local field potentials. Such macroscopic electrical activity in the neocortex is naturally studied {{in the framework of}} cortical networks. However, since the number of neurons and synapses in even a small piece of cortex is immense, a suitable modeling approach is to take a continuum limit of the neural networks and, thus, consider so-called neural field models of the brain cortex. This modeling framework involves integro-differential equations or Volterra integral equations and goes back to the seminal papers by Wilson, Cowan and Amari in the 1970 ’s. In recent years, such neural fields have been used to model a wide range of neurobiological phenomena, including orientation tuning in primary visual cortex, short term working memory, control of head direction, motion perception, geometric visual hallucinations, EEG rhythms, and wave propagation in cortical slices and in vivo. The aforementioned framework, however, {{does not take into account}} the heterogeneity in the cortical structure. Recent works in neuroscience have drawn attention to homogenized neural field models where the brain heterogeneity is captured by a special parameter. Such models are obtained from heterogeneous neural field models by means of homogenization: the two scale convergence method developed by Nguetseng. These investigations have been restricted to a one-dimensional case though. We take a step in the direction of considering a more realistic two-dimensional variation of the homogenized neural field model. We use pinning function technique and spectral properties of Hilbert–Schmidt integral operators to establish existence and stability of localized stationary activity states. Various approximations and numerical approaches, which are frequently used in the mathematical neuroscience, need to be justified rigorously. Using the fixed point theorems and convergence techniques in functional spaces, we investigate the well-posedness aspects of the homogeneous and homogenized neural field models, thus justifying implementation of numerical schemes. We also justify the approximations of continuous neural fields by network models, thus, proving the validity of various disctetization methods. Using compactness in functional spaces and topological degree theory, we justify the approximation of smooth activation functions by the <b>Heaviside</b> <b>unit</b> <b>step</b> function in the case of localized stationary solutions for the n-dimensional homogenized neural field model. The latter result is of particular importance in the aforementioned homogenization procedure. The present thesis illustrates that methods of functional analysis employed in mathematical neuroscience may be very beneficial...|$|E

30|$|Usually, search {{direction}} d^k cannot avoid the Maratos effect, i.e., <b>unit</b> <b>step</b> cannot {{be accepted by}} the associated line search for all sufficiently large iterates k. So, to overcome the Maratos effect and obtain superlinear convergence, one needs to compute an additional high order correction direction. Here, we generate it by solving SLE(V_k; 0,μ̃^k) in Step 5. Obviously, solving SLE(V_k; 0,μ̃^k) should add computational cost more or less. On the other hand, numerical testing shows that d^k can still avoid the Maratos effect at some iterates. Therefore, to save computational cost as much as possible, the trial of <b>unit</b> <b>step</b> in Step 4 is added.|$|R
40|$|A {{continuum}} {{model of}} equilibrium drying processes developed by IIic and Turner [6], [19] is reformulated {{in such a}} way that the source terms are absent. The model is also extended by including a jump through the hysteresis formed by the wetting and drying curves. The jump is expressed in terms of <b>Heaviside</b> <b>unit</b> function. When the unit function is approximated by a sequence of functions, a single system of three coupled nonlinear partial differential equations results. The system is solved numerically using finite difference techniques. Although the drying of wet brick is used for illustration, the method should be useful for more hygroscopic materials. The most significant difference between the old and new results is that there is a definite “kink” in the drying rate curve between the first and second falling rate periods.
