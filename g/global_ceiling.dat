40|$|Humankind faces a {{fundamental}} conflict between global ecology and marketing-oriented consumption culture. Incremental improvements in marketing for the unlimited global market, {{will probably not}} do enough to take us away from various global ecological crises circa 2025. The author proposes idealization-based marketing, with the world automobile industry as an example. 1. Idealization of the automobile society; 2. Idealization of the world transportation system including the automobiles; 3. <b>Global</b> <b>ceiling</b> on {{the total number of}} automobiles that can exist worldwide; 4. <b>Global</b> <b>ceiling</b> on the annual total automobile production; and, then, 5. Free competition among the automobile manufacturers within the cohesive idealized global images of the automobile society, and the automobile production ceiling above. Further, the author proposes idealization-based marketing for various other product categories. Current marketing practice of free competition in the unlimited global market must be changed now. “Failure is not an option ” in our war in global ecology. Keywords...|$|E
40|$|We study {{a dynamic}} carbon {{pollution}} model where carbon accumulates both inside a nonrenewable and a renewable reservoir with a constant regeneration rate. Two primary energy sources are available: a cheap exhaustible fossil fuel (coal) and an expensive clean energy alternative (solar). To avoid catastrophic climate events, the global carbon concentration has to remain below some critical mandated ceiling. We {{show that there}} exists an upper bound on the coal endowment that can be consumed, which distinguishes two main cases: coal is initially abundant or scarce. If the energy sector has to provide a constant aggregate energy flow to the final users, cost-effectiveness requires that the <b>global</b> <b>ceiling</b> should be attained only when solar energy is introduced. Then the economy stays forever {{at the ceiling and}} coal use is progressively replaced by solar energy use. In the abundant coal case, this energy sources substitution process lasts for an infinite duration while in the scarce coal case, coal exploitation ends in finite time. Under a welfare maximization criterion, if coal is abundant, we show that the economy may follow a sequence of phases at the ceiling and below the ceiling before the final transition towards clean energy...|$|E
40|$|In these {{financial}} difficult years many European governments used <b>global</b> <b>ceilings</b> {{to control}} costs of health services. Two scenarios are thinkable. The first is that all individual providers get a budget for their own costs: general practitioners, specialists, hospitals, nursing homes and mental health institutes. The second scenario {{is to work with}} global budgets for health care providers servicing a total population. Scientists and policy makers in Europe, North America and Asia need time to design new payment systems based on the idea of global budgeting, bundled payment and shared savings. </p...|$|R
50|$|The 2015 GMMP {{detected}} {{what appears}} to be a <b>global</b> glass <b>ceiling</b> for female news reporters as far as they are visible in newspaper bylines and newscast reports. Women have consistently reported only 37% of the news over the past decade from 2005 to 2015. Women as news reporters are most present on radio, at 41%, and least in print news, at 35%. Younger presenters on screen are predominantly female, but the scales tip dramatically at 50 years old when men begin to dominate the news-anchoring scene. At 65 years and older, women disappear from the screen as reporters and presenters.|$|R
40|$|This report {{contains}} the model documentation and user instructions of the FAIR model (Framework to Assess International Regimes for differentiation of commitments). FAIR is an interactive - scanner-type - computer model to quantitatively explore {{a range of}} alternative climate policy options for international differentiation of future commitments and link these to targets for global climate protection. The model includes three different approaches for evaluating international commitment regimes: 1) Increasing participation: in this mode the number of parties involved and their level of commitment gradually increase according to participation and differentiation rules, such as per- capita income, per capita emissions, or contribution to global warming. 2) Convergence: in this mode all parties participate in the burden-sharing regime, with emission rights converging to equal per capita levels over time. 3) Triptych: different burden sharing rules are applied for different sectors (e. g. convergence of per capita emissions in the domestic sector, efficiency and de-carbonisation targets for the industry sector and the power generation sector). The first two modes are representatives of top-down methodologies, so from <b>global</b> emission <b>ceilings</b> to regional emission budgets, whereas the triptych approach is more bottom-up in character, although it can be combined with specific emission targets (as illustrated {{in the case of}} the EU). In order to construct and evaluate global emission profiles, the FAIR model also has the mode: Scenario construction. In this mode the impacts in terms of the main climate indicators can be scanned of a constructed or well-defined global emissions profile...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} ten years, ‘The Girl Effect’–the {{discourse}} and practice of investing in third world girls’ education—has ascended {{to the top of}} the international development agenda as the ‘highest return investment strategy’ to end poverty. This paper interrogates the trend by investigating the genealogy of ‘The Girl Effect’ as The Nike Foundation’s flagship corporate social responsibility campaign and the theory of change it is based on. A literature analysis of The Nike Foundation’s most recent intervention projects—“The Girl Effect Accelerator” and ‘Girl Hub’ pilot projects in Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Rwanda—will elucidate the underlying investment logic and serve as a representative sample of the broader emerging practice. While claiming to advance “gender equality” and “women’s empowerment”, I argue that The Girl Effect accomplishes the opposite by reinforcing gender inequity on both the micro and macro levels. Feminist grammars are instrumentalized as window dressing to exploit third world females as prospective (1) debtors in the expansion of credit markets, (2) exploits in the expansion of consumer markets, and (3) the ‘untapped resource’ for cheap labor. An epochal look at second wave feminism will show how ‘The Girl Effect Paradigm’ is a second wave of neoliberal exploitation—a parallel of its first female-led development era (1980 s- 1990 s). This paper warns that as this phenomenon grows in hegemony it is insidiously displacing feminism as a political project and neutralizing the need for a truly transformational agenda. Without a counterbalance of vigilant public scrutiny and debate, we risk letting it crystallize Western- patriarchal-capitalism even more deeply in an unyielding <b>global</b> glass <b>ceiling...</b>|$|R
40|$|The Copenhagen Accord {{performed}} a seizure in the COP ungainly crawl. The Accord’s urgent combat against {{climate change and}} deep cuts in emissions require a policy reversal, ending the zero sum games on pledged caps, creating clarity on immediate marching directions and eliciting worldwide action by today’s operational institutes at all levels. For reducing energy-related CO 2 emissions, all turbo drive components are available. First the <b>global</b> 2 °C <b>ceiling</b> needs translation into, by country, marching directions and indicative future paths of their national average CO 2 emissions per person. The latter intensity indicator {{is the product of}} three driving intensities: wealth per person, energy used for wealth production, and CO 2 emissions of energy use, all observed annually for virtually all countries in the world. Second, parties should commit to nearby year improvements on the three driving intensities. Third, transfers from rich to poor countries depend on ability to pay and on ability to spend, and on countries’ mitigation progress. The approach dissolves main barriers to mitigation progress, like: outdated emissions baselines; illusory global instruments; bureaucratic MRV (monitoring, reporting and verification) concepts; blocked graduation of parties; unclear transfer mechanisms. In revamping the jammed COP rituals, UNFCCC now leaves operations to established global institutes and mainly to the parties acting in common resolve, stimulated and verified by a lightweight, transparent global framework. climate policy architecture; emissions reduction targets; intensity performance indicators...|$|R
