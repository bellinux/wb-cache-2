5|$|Going into spring {{training}} in 2014, Gyorko began focusing on improving <b>his</b> <b>plate</b> discipline, while maintaining his aggressiveness in swinging at hittable pitches. He also lost weight {{in an effort}} to improve his flexibility. Gyorko agreed to a $510,900 salary for the 2014 season. On April 14, Gyorko signed a five-year extension with the Padres worth $35 million, which was the third largest for a player with only one year of service in the majors. After committing four errors in his first 25 games, Gyorko increased his infield practice with Glenn Hoffman, the Padres' third base and infield coach.|$|E

On June 12 he caught Justin Verlander's first no-hitter, the second no-hitter he caught in his career. In 2007, Rodríguez walked in only 1.8 percent of <b>his</b> <b>plate</b> appearances, the lowest {{percentage}} in the major leagues. On October 9, the Tigers announced that they were picking up the fifth-year, 13-million-dollar option on Rodríguez's contract, keeping him on the Tigers team through at least the 2008 season. The team could have bought out the option for three million dollars and allowed him to become a free agent.|$|E

25|$|In 1916, the Tigers began {{transitioning}} {{the right}} field responsibilities from Crawford to their young hitting star, Harry Heilmann. That year, Crawford played 78 games in right field, and Heilmann played 66. Despite leading {{the league in}} both RBIs (112) and extra base hits (54) in 1915, Crawford saw <b>his</b> <b>plate</b> appearances cut almost in half in 1916 (from 694 to 368) as the Tigers made room in the lineup for Heilmann.|$|E
500|$|Braun {{was named}} NL Player of the Week for May 4–10, after leading the NL with 12 RBIs {{for the week}} while hitting [...]458/.567/.958 with 3 home runs.

500|$|Granderson hit [...]302 with 23 {{home runs}} for the season, and was 26 for 27 in stolen base attempts. [...] He also {{improved}} <b>his</b> <b>plate</b> discipline, as he finished seventh in the AL in strikeouts with 141. He {{was one of only}} six batters in the AL to have at least 20 home runs and 20 stolen bases, along with teammate Gary Sheffield, Ian Kinsler, Alex Rodriguez, Grady Sizemore and B. J. Upton.|$|E
50|$|Rops often {{combined}} soft-ground etching—a technique {{practiced by}} few artists of his day—with mezzotint or aquatint and sometimes added hand-coloring to <b>his</b> <b>plates.</b> <b>His</b> etchings were popular and influenced many younger artists, including Symbolists such as Edvard Munch and Max Klinger.|$|R

5000|$|It is as an {{engraver}} that Sherwin is most esteemed; {{and it may}} {{be noted}} that he was ambidextrous, working indifferently with either hand upon <b>his</b> <b>plates.</b> <b>His</b> drawing is correct, his line excellent and his textures are varied and intelligent in expression. Such of <b>his</b> <b>plates</b> as the [...] "Holy Family" [...] after Nicholas Poussin, [...] "Christ Bearing the Cross" [...] after Murillo, the portrait of the marquis of Buckingham after Thomas Gainsborough and that of Pitt occupy a high place among the productions of the English school of line-engravers. He also worked after Pine, Dance and Kauffman.|$|R
500|$|Standing [...] and {{weighing}} , Heyward has {{shown to be}} an all-round talent. [...] In the minor leagues, his ability to hit for batting average and power, speed, plus defense and arm strength sufficient to play right field, caused him {{to be considered a}} five-tool player. [...] Further, <b>his</b> <b>plate</b> discipline and ability to draw walks are unusual for a player his height. [...] He generates much of his power as a pull hitter.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2008 season, the Tigers signed Granderson to a five-year, US$30.25million {{contract}} with a club option for 2013. Granderson continued hitting well during the 2008 regular season, finishing with a [...]280 batting average, 13 triples and 22 home runs. [...] He continued to improve <b>his</b> <b>plate</b> discipline, striking out only 111 times (versus 141 in 2007 and 174 in 2006) and drawing a career-high 71 walks. [...] During August, he hit six triples, including two in consecutive innings during a game against the Texas Rangers.|$|E

[...] 12.5% of <b>his</b> <b>plate</b> appearances were extra base hits (3rd in the NL; behind Ryan Ludwick and Pujols), he had 29 infield hits (7th), and he stole third base 6 times (9th).|$|E
500|$|Thome became Chicago's regular {{designated}} hitter in April 2006 and flourished {{in his first}} season in Chicago. He set the team record for most home runs in the month of April (10), overtaking Frank Thomas's previous record by one. He also set a major league record by scoring in each of Chicago's first 17 games. For the season, Thome hit 42 home runs, drove in 109 runs, and hit [...]288, though he struck out in 30% of <b>his</b> <b>plate</b> appearances, the highest percentage in the AL. On May 1, 2006, Thome returned to Cleveland to play against the Indians in his first game as a visitor at Jacobs Field, and received an unenthusiastic reception.|$|E
500|$|Three years later, Alexandra blamed sixteen-year-old Olga, who {{was sitting}} beside her seven-year-old brother, for failing to control the misbehaving Tsarevich Alexei during a family dinner. The spoiled Alexei teased others at the table, refused to sit up in his chair, wouldn't eat his food and licked <b>his</b> <b>plate.</b> The Tsarina's {{expectation}} was unreasonable, said Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich of Russia, a distant cousin of the imperial family. [...] "Olga cannot deal with him", {{he wrote in his}} diary on March 18, 1912. Court official A. A. Mossolov wrote that Olga was already seventeen, but still [...] "she had the ways of a flapper", referring to her rough manners and liking for exuberant play.|$|E
50|$|He {{produced}} many etchings as well, {{and some}} of <b>his</b> <b>plates</b> are still preserved. His self-portrait, engraved by himself {{at the age of}} fifty, still exists.|$|R
50|$|His {{compositions}} are abundant, but {{he lacked}} taste {{in the selection}} of his forms. He finished <b>his</b> <b>plates</b> very neatly with the burin. There is not much effect in his print as he was not skilled in chiaroscuro. Notwithstanding this defect, which was very general in the period in which he lived, his works possess considerable merit. He worked in Rotterdam from 1617 onwards, and he died there in 1656. He signed <b>his</b> <b>plates</b> sometimes with <b>his</b> initials N. de B., and sometimes with a monogram.|$|R
5000|$|After Rudolf II died {{he enjoyed}} the favour and {{protection}} of the two succeeding Emperors, Matthias and Ferdinand II. According to Michael Bryan, [...] "He used the graver with a commanding facility, sometimes finishing <b>his</b> <b>plates</b> with surprising neatness, when the subject required it; at other times his burin is broad and bold. <b>His</b> <b>plates</b> are very numerous, representing historical subjects, portraits, landscapes, &c. some of them from his own designs, {{many of which are}} much esteemed, particularly his portraits, which are executed in an admirable style.|$|R
500|$|More favourably, Cott {{explicitly}} recognises Thayer's work on countershading, though granting Edward Bagnall Poulton's partial anticipation {{with his}} work on the chrysalis of the purple emperor butterfly. Further, Cott quotes Thayer's description of countershading, and Cott's Figure 1, of countershaded fish, is captioned [...] "Diagrams illustrating Thayer's principle of obliterative shading". Implicitly, also, Cott follows Thayer in his Figure 3 [...] "Larva of Eyed Hawk-moth" [...] in both [...] "natural (e.g. 'up-side-down')" [...] and [...] "unnatural" [...] positions; in his Figure 5 drawing of the disruptive effect of the stripes and bold markings of woodcock chicks (like Thayer's Figure 81); in <b>his</b> <b>Plate</b> 7, with (just like Thayer's Figure 7) a photograph of a white cock against a white background; in his Figure 18 and front cover drawings of a copperhead snake lying on a bed of leaves, with and without its disruptive pattern (like Thayer's Plate 11) and so on.|$|E

500|$|Ruth went 24–13 with a 2.01 ERA and six shutouts in 1917, but the Sox {{finished}} {{in second place}} in the league, nine games behind the Chicago White Sox in the standings. On June 23 at Washington, Ruth made a memorable pitching start. When home plate umpire 'Brick' Owens called the first four pitches as balls, Ruth threw a punch at him, and was ejected from the game and later suspended for ten days and fined $100. Ernie Shore was called in to relieve Ruth, and was allowed eight warm-up pitches. The runner who had reached base on the walk was caught stealing, and Shore retired all 26 batters he faced to win the game. Shore's feat was listed as a perfect game for many years; in 1991, Major League Baseball's (MLB) Committee on Statistical Accuracy caused it to be listed as a combined no-hitter. In 1917, Ruth was little-used as a batter, other than for <b>his</b> <b>plate</b> appearances while pitching, and hit [...]325 with two home runs.|$|E
