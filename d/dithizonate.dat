50|$|The rate {{constant}} {{of a particular}} reaction can be determined by measuring the UV/Vis absorbance spectrum at specific time intervals. Using mercury <b>dithizonate</b> again as an example, one can shine light on the sample to turn the solution blue, then run a UV/Vis test every 10 seconds (variable) to see the levels of absorbed and reflected wavelengths change over time {{in accordance with the}} solution turning back to yellow from the excited blue energy state. From these measurements, the concentration of the two species can be calculated. The mercury <b>dithizonate</b> reaction from one conformation to another is first order and would have the integral first order rate law : lnA(time t)=−kt+lnA(initial). Therefore, graphing the natural log (ln) of the concentration A versus time will graph a line with slope -k, or negative the {{rate constant}}. Different rate orders have different integrated rate laws depending on the mechanism of the reaction.|$|E

The anti, s-trans configuration of the solid state is also preferred in solution where it is in equilibrium with the syn, s-cis configuration. 3 -Ethyl- 1, 5 -diphenylformazan exists in two isomers in the solid state, both of which have been characterised by an x-ray crystal analysis. The red isomer of 3 -ethyl- 1, 5 -diphenylformazan belongs to the orthorhombic space group P 2 l 2 l 2 l and adopts the syn, s-trans configuration in the solid state. The orange, light stable isomer of 3 -ethyl- 1, 5 -diphenylformazan belongs to the monoclinic space group P 2 l/c and adopts the anti, s-trans configuration in the solid state. The rate of return of the photo-activated orange isomer to the dark-stable red isomer follows first order kinetics dependent upon the total concentration of the formazan and the water content of the solvent. 3 -Tertiary-butyl- 1, 5 -diphenylformazan has been characterised by an x-ray crystal analysis.

The syn, s-cis configuration of the solid state is maintained in solution. 1, 3, 5 -Triphenylformazan is shown to exist in two red forms in the solid state. The syn, s-cis and syn, s-trans isomers are both present in the crystalline sample. These isomers are also evident in solution with the syn, s-trans configuration becoming more dominant in aprotic solvents. 1, 5 -Diphenylformazan reacts with bromine in solution in a single reaction to give di(3 -bromo- 1, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium) -decabromide and 3 -bromo- 1, 5 -di-para-phenylformazan, both of which have been characterised by an x-ray crystal analysis.

The formazan adopts the anti, s-trans configuration in the solid state. 3 -Chloro- 1, 5 -diphenylformazan has been characterised by an x-ray crystal analysis. Preliminary results indicate that the formazan adopts the anti, s-trans configuration in the solid state. 3 -Mercapto- 1, 5 -diphenylformazan is shown to exist in the anti, s-trans configuration in CDCl 3, solution. 3 -Methylthio- 1, 5 -diphenylformazan is shown to exist in an equilibrium mixture of syn, s-trans and anti, s-trans configurations in solution. The ratio of the two isomers is approximately equal. 3 -Ethylthio- 1, 5 -diphenylformazan exists in two isomers in the solid state, one of which has been characterised by an x-ray crystal analysis.

The orange and red isomers are both present in an equilibrium mixture in solution. The red isomer is shown to exist in the syn, s-trans configuration in the solid. 3 -isopropylthio- 1, 5 -diphenylformazan is shown to exist in an equilibrium mixture of anti, s-trans and syn, s-trans configurations in solution. 1 -Methyl- 1, 5 -diphenylformazan has been characterised by an x-ray crystal analysis. C 14 H 14 N 4 belongs to the monoclinic space group 12 / 1, a = 28. 402 (7), b = 5. 640 (1), c = 15. 688 (4) A, beta = 97. 34 degrees, U = 2493 (1) A 3, Z = 8. The formazan adopts the anti, s-trans configuration in the solid state. The formazan retains its configurational integrity in both protic and aprotic solutions. The excitation profile of the Raman active phonons based upon coupled vibrations of the formazan backbone indicate a maximum corresponding to the absorption spectra in both the solid state and in solution. Preliminary results of a kinetic investigation of some primary metal <b>dithizonates</b> indicate that the thermal-path return is strictly first order.

The thermal behaviour of those series of compounds isolated was investigated by polarized optical microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. The organomercury(II) acetates displayed a limited, poorly-defined mesomorphism {{and the type of}} any mesophase formed remains unidentified. The 4 -n-alkoxy- 4 '-bromobiphenyls (alkoxy = CₙH 2 n+ 1 0, n = 3 - 5, 10 - 12, 14 - 16 or 18) exhibited liquid crystalline behaviour within a broad temperature range for the compounds with n ~ 10 {{and the nature of the}} mesophases was tentatatively assigned as smectic D and C.

However, none of the <b>dithizonate</b> derivatives was mesomorphic and this was attributed to the geometry of the <b>dithizonate</b> ligand. The organomercury(II) dithizonates were photochromic in organic solvents, displaying reversible colour changes from yellow to blue on irradiation with visible light.

40|$|Paneth {{cells are}} zinc-containing cells widely {{distributed}} in Lieberkühn's crypts of intestine {{in a variety}} of species. We found that rapid selective killing of Paneth cells took place after the intravenous (i. v.) injection of diphenylthiocarbazone (dithizone), a chelator forming a zinc <b>dithizonate</b> complex, in the rat. As soon as 5 min after the i. v. injection of dithizone, degeneration of Paneth cells occurred. At this stage, zinc <b>dithizonate</b> complexes were observed as purple-red granules in bright field microscopy. Thirty to 60 min later, Paneth cells were detached from the basement membrane and shed into the cryptic lumen. After 6 h, the cell debris in the crypts was no longer seen and the crypts once housing Paneth cells were now occupied by neighbouring crypt base columnar cells. Histochemically demonstrable zinc totally disappeared. After 12 - 24 h, however, definite Paneth cells began to resume. Histochemical staining for zinc was again positive at the apex of these cells. One week after dithizone administration, the number of Paneth cells increased twice as much as in uninjected control and histochemical staining for zinc was highly positive. After 2 weeks, Paneth cell hyperplasia subsided. X-ray microanalysis revealed that zinc was the most abundant metal in Paneth cells. We concluded that chelation of zinc and formation of zinc-dithizone complexes in Paneth cells' cytoplasm would be responsible for the selective degeneration observed after dithizone administration...|$|E
40|$|Thermal and photo-isomerization {{reactions}} of mercury <b>dithizonate</b> and 4 -dimethylaminoazobenzene were studied in solutions and in polymer matrices. We used exponential functions {{to calculate the}} rate constants for both processes. The kinetic behavior was well described by mono-exponential functions for these dyes dissolved in solvents, although bi-exponential functions are required when these dyes are dissolved in polymers. The rate constants are strongly influenced by dye/solvent and dye/polymer interactions, {{as well as by}} the aging processes of the polymer matrix. In general, the reaction is faster in more polar mediums, solvents or polymer matrices, since stabilization of different tautomers takes place. We also showed that larger molecules isomerize slowly and slower isomerization has also been observed for annealed samples.

The bond lengths reveal complete n-electron delocalization along the chain which results in a mesomeric structure; the possibility of such a mesomeric structure existing in solution rather than a rapid tautomeric equilibrium between two limiting forms of the resonance hybrid has been considered in the light of i. r. and n. m. r. spectroscopic measurements. The temporal changes in the visible absorption spectrum of S-methyldithizone, PhN:N•C(SCH 3) :N•NHPh, have been shown to arise from syn-anti isomerization about the fonnal C=N double bond and rotation about the C-N single bond by considering the evidence provided by i. r. and n. m. r. spectroscopic studies combined with the X-ray {{crystal structure}} of the di(o-tolyl) homologue.

40|$|A {{series of}} heterobi- and tri-metallic {{complexes}} were {{prepared by the}} metallation of the carbanion derived from [M(CO) ₄(dppm) ] (M = Cr, Mo or W), [ML(dppm) ] (L= dithiolene; M = Pd or Pt), or the cationic precursor, [Ru(Cp) (PPh 3) (dppm) ]PF₆. The complexes were characterized by ¹H and ³¹P NMR, IR and UV/Vis spectroscopies and X-ray crystallography. The presence of electrochemical communication in these complexes was investigated by means of cyclic voltammetry. Correlation studies of electrochemical potentials and 31 P NMR data or carbonyl stretching frequencies of the Group 6 mercurated complexes show that the mercury atom does facilitate the flow of electrons through the four-membered chelate ring. However, this effect has been established to be weak. Similar weak electronic effects were found {{to exist in the}} case of the Ru, Pd and Pt complexes. Evidence of "through-space" communication was established to be present in the ferrocenyl derivatives. X-ray crystallographic studies show that mercuration of the carbanion neutralizes the residual electron density in the chelate ring for the chromium bi- and tri-metallic complexes. This was also demonstrated for the cationic ruthenium complex. X-ray crystallographic studies were performed on dithizone and its corresponding salt in an attempt to resolve or explain the often debated tautomerism of this molecule in the solid state and in solution. The structure of the parent molecule showed the co-existence of the two tautomeric forms in a single structure, with a 2 : 1 preference for the symmetrical keto form, compared to the enol form. DFT calculations have been performed and have been shown to be mutually consistent with structural data, showing a negligible energy difference of 3. 1 kcal mol⁻¹ between the two forms. Computational calculations were also performed to investigate the solution characteristics of the <b>dithizonate</b> salt. An analysis of the HOMO and Fukui functions show the sulfur atom to be the most nucleophilic and therefore the preferred site for deprotonation with an energy barrier of 17 kJ mol⁻¹ compared to the nitrogen atom. While the 1 H NMR spectrum shows evidence of the existence of proton exchange in solution, we were unable to model this. However, DFT solution studies show that the keto form is most stabilized. A series of palladium and platinum <b>dithizonate</b> complexes, with the general formula, [M(PP) (Hdptc) ]X or [M(PP) (dptc) ] (PP = mono- or bidentate phosphine ligand; M = Pd or Pt; X = PF₆ or BPh₄), was prepared and investigated for their photochromic behaviour. None of these complexes exhibited any photochromism. X-ray crystal structures of [Pt(COD) (dptc) ] and [Pt(dppf) (dptc) ] were determined. Both complexes contain the dithizone ligand in a doubly deprotonated, or secondary, form. Synthetic routes to the preparation of mixed dithiolene-dithizone complexes of mercury and platinum were developed. The complexes were characterized by ¹H and ¹³C NMR, IR and UV/Vis spectroscopies and X-ray crystallography. Spectroscopic studies show that the mercury complexes are all photochromic, while the platinum complex showed no photochromism in solution. Electrochemical studies show the absence of rich electrochemical activity for the Hg complexes. The [Pt(mnt) (Hdptc) ]⁺ complexes, in contrast, showed greater redox activity. X-ray studies on the analogous complexes, Ph₄As[Hg(mnt) (Hdptc) ] and Bu₄N[Pt(mnt) (Hdptc) ] revealed an absence of any S···S or Metal···S interactions, often associated with planar sulfur rich ligands...|$|E
40|$|Heavy metals {{are taken}} up by the {{vascular}} plant root system from water solutions in cationic forms. Subsequently, during both short and long distance transport to other plant tissues, cation forms are incorporated to many bioorganic compounds differing in stability, ionic character and physico-chemical properties such as solubility in lipid structures and mobility across cell membrane systems. Many sequential and single step extraction methods have been elaborated for characterization of the role of individual components of plant cells components in transport and detoxication of heavy metals. In our study, dry biomass of giant reed (Arundo donax L.) grown in hydroponic media spiked with 65 ZnCl 2 and 109 CdCl 2 was treated with dithizone solutions as complexing ligand in order to convert free Zn 2 + and Cd 2 + ions to corresponding dithizonates. Treatment with dithizone showed that up to 67 % of the total plant Cd and 56 % of the total plant Zn were transformed to <b>dithizonate</b> complexes extracted with chloroform. Extraction of biomass with Folch reagent showed that up to 48 % of the total root cadmium and up to 18 % of the total shoot cadmium is bound in lipid fraction.

40|$|The solvent {{extraction}} of inorganic complexes {{has been studied}} in connection with two distinct problems, (i) the determination of small quantities of silver {{at a level of}} 1 part in 10 8 in trade effluent, and (ii) the measurement of the stability constants of metal completes which are very sparingly soluble in water, though soluble in an organic solvent. (i) The method finally proposed for the determination of small quantities of silver in trade effluent containing organic material in addition to copper, iron, lead, mercury, and calcium, etc. was arrived at after detailed study of a) The concentration of the silver b) The separation of the silver from elements likely to interfere in the final determination. c) The absorptiometric determination. a) Concentration of silver by co-precipitation was investigated using Ag 110 m as a radioactive tracer. It was found that silver was quantitatively co-precipitated as sulphide with mercury, copper, and lead. If organic material was present in the solution it was more satisfactory to co-precipitate the silver with elementary tellurium. Although efficient as a means of concentration, co-precipitation did not provide a satisfactory separation of silver from the metals likely to interfere in the final determination. The silver complex of dithizone (diphenyl thiocarbazone) is soluble in organic solvents, and its considerable stability to acid solutions suggested that it would provide a very useful method of concentration of silver by a factor of 10 or better, since only mercury and some copper are likely to be co-extracted. These predictions-were verified experimentally and, in addition to concentration, a preliminary separation of silver was thus effected. b) It was shown that a solution of dithizone in carbon tetrachloride would retain copper and mercury even in the presence of aqueous thiocyanate, but that the superior stability if the thiocyanate complex of silver over that of the dithizone complex, permitted its quantitative back extraction into an acidic aqueous phase. Selective extraction was thus obtained, After the thiocyanate had been destroyed by wet ashing the whole of the silver was obtained free from metals which could interfere in the final determination. c) p-Dimethylaminobenzylidene rhodanine, tetraethylthiouram disulphide and dithizone were all considered for the absorptiometric determination of silver. Dithizone was finally chosen as it was considered to provide the best compromise between overall accuracy and general convenience for the determination of the concentration of silver after destruction of the thiocyanate with sulphuric acid. Both visual and photoelectric determinations were found to be accurate to ± 0. 1 μg in the range from 0 - 10 μg. It was found that traces of silver are absorbed upon glassware very readily. If, however, all surfaces which are likely to come into contact with the element are given a coating of silica by treatment with a commercial silicone preparation, {{it was found that the}} absorption could be reduced to negligible proportions. (ii) The determination of the stability constant of the metal complex ML n by the normal titration technique is not possible if it is insoluble in an aqueous phase. If the complex is soluble in an organic phase, however, it is often possible to determine a mixed stability constant K′ f, where K′ f = [ML n] o /[M n+] w [L -] n w (the subscripts o and w referring to the organic and aqueous phases respectively) which involves a partition coefficient. This is not altogether satisfactory, since comparison of the changes in this stability constant observed going from one compound to another in a series of closely related complexing agents, involve concomitant changes in the partition coefficients p r and p c, of the reagent HL and the complex ML n respectively. A method is derived from theoretical principles which enables the true formation constant K f of ML n K f = [ML n] w /[M n+] w [L -] n w to be obtained if the metal M is labelled with a radioactive isotope. An added complication is the possible presence of lower complexes ML, ML 2 [...] . in the aqueous phase. A full theoretical study of equilibrium between a solution containing metal complexes ML j, (j = 0 to N) in the aqueous phase, in equilibrium with an immiscible organic phase in to which only the formally neutral species ML n is extracted, shows that a) the relative concentrations of the intermediate species is lower than for a single phase system, and b) the overall degree of formation is higher. It has also been shown that Job's Method of Continuous Variations applies equally to a two-phase system and enables the composition of the extracted species to be determined with greater reliability than in the case of a one-phase system. If the radioactive isotope of M is available so that the total concentration of metal in the aqueous phase (j = N j = O Σ[ML j]) and in the organic phase ([ML n] o) is known, the stability constants β n of all the intermediate complexes may be calculated, where β n = [ML n] w /[M n+] w [L -] n w. By use of radioactive silver f the solubility of some substituted dithizones in water and several organic solvents is obtained, in order to calculate the partition coefficients. Also the two-phase method of continuous variants is applied to the indium-dithizone system and the extinction coefficient and the overall formation constant of indium <b>dithizonate</b> calculated. </p...|$|E
