40|$|We have {{recorded}} Fourier transform spectra of OCS between 6170 and 6680 cm- 1, and between 7700 and 8160 cm- 1 using a femto/OPO laser absorption source and cavity enhanced spectroscopy. <b>Equivalent</b> <b>absorption</b> <b>path</b> lengths varying between 7 and 13 km were obtained {{depending on the}} specific spectral region. In the lower and higher energy ranges, 7 and 12 new bands were observed, respectively, while improved results were gained on those previously reported in the literature. Some of these data brought significant, new information on the rovibrational energy pattern in OCS that triggered an update of the latest published global polyad model (Rbaihi et al. J Mol Spectrosc 1998; 191 : 32 [15]). The new fit includes {{for the first time}} all overtone data since published in the literature, covering the range 6200 - 13950 cm- 1, as well as all known lower energy ones. All data selected for the global analysis of carbonyl sulphide 16 O 12 C 32 S are provided as supplementary information. The previous polyad model was extended to include the inter-polyad anharmonic k 1113 and Coriolis C 11222 interactions, leading to simultaneously deal with sets of nine interacting polyad matrices at a time, each polyad defined by N= 2 v 1 +v 2 + 4 v 3 (with 1 - 3 the conventional normal modes in OCS). We have obtained a statistical agreement with all experimental data with an estimated standard deviation better than unity (σ= 0. 7568). The fit produced 141 molecular parameters, of which 4 concern the new inter-polyad resonances. They have been used to calculate effective rovibrational parameters for all sub-states up to more than 12, 000 cm- 1, listed in a Depository (Appendix B). A list of line parameters, covering the measured spectral ranges and including line intensities determined using previously recorded Fourier transform spectra of the two strongest bands observed in the present work, was generated in HITRAN format. It is also provided as supplementary information. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|On {{account of}} LN Akustikmiljö AB, the sound energy {{absorption}} of various rooms was estimated using two methods; {{by measuring the}} steady-­‐state sound pressure levels in the rooms when excited by a reference sound source and by measuring the reverberation time. The reason for the comparison was that the reverberation time was not always a satisfactory measure of the acoustical performance of rooms, {{even though it was}} the only requirement in Swedish standard SS 25268 : 2007 [1]. Thus, it was suggested to try alternative methods to measure the acoustical performance of the rooms. Measurements were performed in 18 rooms with varying volume and acoustical treatment. The <b>equivalent</b> <b>absorption</b> area of each room was calculated from both methods. Comparison between the two methods showed large differences in the <b>equivalent</b> <b>absorption</b> area; however which value was the best representation of the actual real situation is a complex problem, which varies with the dimensions and acoustical treatment of the room and the frequency band and will need further research...|$|R
40|$|A rapid, high {{sensitivity}} {{differential absorption}} carbon monoxide monitor (DACOM) {{has been developed}} to measure CO from an aircraft. The differential absorption measurement is accomplished by rapidly current tuning the wavelength of a PbSSe diode laser across a single 4. 7 micron CO absorption line. As the laser wavelength sweeps periodically across the absorption line, the laser beam is amplitude modulated and is then synchronously detected. With this technique a minimum detectable differential transmission of 0. 02 % is obtained for a 1 second integration time. This performance is equivalent to a CO sensitivity of 5 ppb for a 10 meter <b>absorption</b> <b>path.</b> The techniques used to achieve this high sensitivity will be discussed.
