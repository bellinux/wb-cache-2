5|$|By definition, antagonists display no {{efficacy}} {{to activate}} the receptors they bind. Antagonists do not maintain the ability to activate a receptor. Once bound, however, antagonists inhibit the function of agonists, inverse agonists, and partial agonists. In functional antagonist assays, a <b>dose-response</b> curve measures {{the effect of the}} ability of a range of concentrations of antagonists to reverse the activity of an agonist. The potency of an antagonist is usually defined by its half maximal inhibitory concentration (i.e., IC50 value). This can be calculated for a given antagonist by determining the concentration of antagonist needed to elicit half inhibition of the maximum biological response of an agonist. Elucidating an IC50 value is useful for comparing the potency of drugs with similar efficacies, however the <b>dose-response</b> curves produced by both drug antagonists must be similar. The lower the IC50 the greater the potency of the antagonist, and the lower the concentration of drug that is required to inhibit the maximum biological response. Lower concentrations of drugs may be associated with fewer side-effects.|$|E

The most sensitive is liver cancer in female rats, {{and this has}} long been a basis for risk assessment. <b>Dose-response</b> of TCDD in causing cancer {{does not seem to be}} linear, and there is a threshold below which it seems to cause no cancer. TCDD is not mutagenic or genotoxic, in other words, it is not able to initiate cancer, and the cancer risk is based on promotion of cancer initiated by other compounds or on indirect effects such as disturbing defense mechanisms of the body e.g. by preventing apoptosis or programmed death of altered cells. Carcinogenicity is associated with tissue damage, and it is often viewed now as secondary to tissue damage.|$|E
40|$|Reducing {{the knee}} {{adduction}} moment (KAM) is a promising treatment for medial compartment knee osteoarthritis (OA). Although several gait modifications {{to lower the}} KAM have been identified, the potential to combine modifications and individual <b>dose-responses</b> remain unknown. This study hypothesized that: (i) {{there is a general}} scheme consisting of modifications in trunk sway, step width, walking speed, and foot progression angle that reduces the KAM; (ii) gait modifications can be combined; and (iii) <b>dose-responses</b> differ among individuals. Walking trials with simultaneous modifications in step width, walking speed, progression angle, and trunk sway were analyzed for 10 healthy subjects. Wider step width, slower speed, toeing-in, and increased trunk sway resulted in reduced first KAM peak, whereas wider step width, faster speed, and increased trunk sway reduced the KAM angular impulse. Individual regressions accurately modeled the amplitude of the KAM variables relative to the amplitude of the gait modification variables, while the <b>dose-responses</b> varied strongly among participants. In conclusion, increasing trunk sway, increasing step width, and toeing-in are three gait modifications that could be combined to reduce KAM variables related to knee OA. Results also indicated that some gait modifications reducing the KAM induced changes in the knee flexion moment possibly indicative of an increase in knee loading. Taken together with the different <b>dose-responses</b> among subjects, this study suggested that gait retraining programs should consider this general scheme of modifications with individualization of the modification amplitudes. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Acetylcholine relaxed pre-constricted coronary or aortic preparations but only when endothelium was present. This relaxation was inhibited by quinacrine or hydroquinone. Aortic preparations had resting tone which could be increased by hydroquinone if endothelium was present, suggesting continual release of endothelium-derived relaxant factor (EDRF) at rest. When allowance was made for basal EDRF activity in aortic preparations, the maximal constrictor response to acetylcholine remained lower in the presence of endothelium, consistent with acetylcholine stimulation of EDRF, but maximal constrictor responses to the other three agents were the same with and without endothelium, suggesting that the direct constrictor response overrides EDRF activity...|$|R

5|$|Irreversible antagonists covalently bind to the {{receptor}} target and, in general, {{cannot be}} removed; inactivating the receptor {{for the duration}} of the antagonist effects is determined by the rate of receptor turnover, the rate of synthesis of new receptors. Phenoxybenzamine is an example of an irreversible alpha blocker—it permanently binds to α adrenergic receptors, preventing adrenaline and noradrenaline from binding. Inactivation of receptors normally results in a depression of the maximal response of agonist <b>dose-response</b> curves and a right shift in the curve occurs where there is a receptor reserve similar to non-competitive antagonists. A washout step in the assay will usually distinguish between non-competitive and irreversible antagonist drugs, as effects of non-competitive antagonists are reversible and activity of agonist will be restored.|$|E

40|$|Transcription factors (TFs) {{interact}} with {{a multitude of}} binding sites on DNA and partner proteins inside cells. We investigate how nonspecific binding/unbinding to such decoy binding sites affects the magnitude and time-scale of random fluctuations in TF copy numbers arising from stochastic gene expression. A stochastic model of TF gene expression, together with decoy site interactions is formulated. Distributions for the total (bound and unbound) and free (unbound) TF levels are derived by analytically solving the chemical master equation under physiologically relevant assumptions. Our results show that {{increasing the number of}} decoy binding sides considerably reduces stochasticity in free TF copy numbers. The TF autocorrelation function reveals that decoy sites can either enhance or shorten the time-scale of TF fluctuations depending on model parameters. To understand how noise in TF abundances propagates downstream, a TF target gene is included in the model. Intriguingly, we find that noise in the expression of the target gene decreases with increasing decoy sites for linear TF-target protein <b>dose-responses,</b> even in regimes where decoy sites enhance TF autocorrelation times. Moreover, counterintuitive noise transmissions arise for nonlinear <b>dose-responses.</b> In summary, our study highlights the critical role of molecular sequestration by decoy binding sites in regulating the stochastic dynamics of TFs and target proteins at the single-cell level.

40|$|Abstract Background Xenoestrogens such as alkylphenols and the {{structurally}} related plastic byproduct bisphenol A {{have recently}} been shown to act potently via nongenomic signaling pathways and the membrane version of estrogen receptor-α. Though the responses to these compounds are typically measured individually, they usually contaminate organisms that already have endogenous estrogens present. Therefore, we used quantitative medium-throughput screening assays to measure the effects of physiologic estrogens in combination with these xenoestrogens. Methods We studied the effects of low concentrations of endogenous estrogens (estradiol, estriol, and estrone) at 10 pM (representing pre-development levels), and 1 nM (representing higher cycle-dependent and pregnancy levels) in combinations with the same levels of xenoestrogens in GH 3 /B 6 /F 10 pituitary cells. These levels of xenoestrogens represent extremely low contamination levels. We monitored calcium entry into cells using Fura- 2 fluorescence imaging of single cells. Prolactin release was measured by radio-immunoassay. Extracellular-regulated kinase (1 and 2) phospho-activations and the levels of three estrogen receptors in the cell membrane (ERα, ERβ, and GPER) were measured using a quantitative plate immunoassay of fixed cells either permeabilized or nonpermeabilized (respectively). Results All xenoestrogens caused responses at these concentrations, and had disruptive effects on the actions of physiologic estrogens. Xenoestrogens reduced the % of cells that responded to estradiol via calcium channel opening. They also inhibited the activation (phosphorylation) of extracellular-regulated kinases at some concentrations. They either inhibited or enhanced rapid prolactin release, depending upon concentration. These latter two <b>dose-responses</b> were nonmonotonic, a characteristic of nongenomic estrogenic responses. Conclusions Responses mediated by endogenous estrogens representing different life stages are vulnerable to very low concentrations of these structurally related xenoestrogens.

This is in contrast to benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine (Z-drug) hypnotics, which are additionally effective in improving sleep onset latency. However, it is also in contrast to higher doses of doxepin (50 to 300mg/day), which have been found to significantly reduce latency to sleep onset.

In Ecuador, this hematophagous ectoparasite has been observed between 0 and 2600 masl. One of the main tick control measures is the use of acaricides, which have been indiscriminately used worldwide and in Ecuador. In this country, no studies on acaricide resistance in Rhipicephalus microplus have been published. The current study aims to characterise the level of resistance of R. microplus against three main acaricides commonly used in Ecuador i. e. amitraz, alpha-cypermethrin and ivermectin to determine the level and pattern of <b>dose-responses</b> for R. microplus in 12 field populations (farms). The level of acaricide resistance was evaluated using three different bioassays: adult immersion test (AIT), larval package test (LPT) and larval immersion test (LIT), as recommended by the FAO. The predictive <b>dose-responses</b> were analysed by binomial logistics regression of the larval survival rate (resistance). In general, we found resistance of 67 % for amitraz; 50 % for alpha-cypermethrin and from 25 to 42 % for ivermectin in the twelve field populations analysed. Resistance levels were studied in larval and adult bioassays, respectively, which were slightly modified for this study. For larval bioassays based on corrected mortality i. e. high (above 51 %), medium (21 - 50 %) and low (11 - 20 %) resistance, percentages less than 10 % were considered as susceptible. For the adult test, two resistance levels were used i. e. high (more than 76 %) and medium (51 to 75 %) resistance. Percentages lower than 50 % were considered as susceptible. In this context, for larval bioassays, amitraz showed 21 %, 38 % and 8 % for high, medium and low resistance, respectively. Alpha-cypermethrin presented 8 %, 4 and 38 % for high, medium and low resistance, respectively. Ivermectin presented 8 %, 25 % and 8 % for high, medium and low resistance, respectively. For adult tests with amitraz 50 % and 17 % of the field populations showed average and high resistance, with evidences of average resistance to alpha-cypermethrin in 50 % of the samples and average resistance against ivermectin in 25 % of the farms. No statistical difference amongst the three bioassays was found and acaricide resistance was confirmed by logistic regression analysis; hence resistance (<b>dose-responses)</b> in each field populations differed, depending on the choice of the acaricide, frequent usage, frequency of treatment and farm management. The effective estimated dose needed to eliminate 99 % of ticks is higher than dose recommended by the manufacturer. In conclusion, amitraz showed the highest resistance followed by ivermectin and alpha-cypermethrin and reveals differences on resistance in each individual field population. This information is important in order to establish the monitoring of resistance on each farm individually, contributing to the rational use of acaricides included in an integrated control program for R. microplus...|$|R
