2500|$|In {{the first}} half of 1926, Rohrbach {{introduced}} the Ro IIIa Rodra. The new variant was more powerful, with two [...] Lorraine 12E Courlis W12 water-cooled engines in shorter and more streamlined cowlings, with their <b>honeycomb</b> <b>radiators</b> on the wing underside below them. The wing was mounted on top of the fuselage, its span reduced by , and the ailerons were no longer compensated.|$|R

50|$|The four prototypes {{and first}} {{production}} batch of six aircraft were built at Cricklewood, {{with the first}} aircraft delivered by road to Hendon on 9 December 1915. The first flight of the prototype, serial number 1455, was made at Hendon on 17 December, when a short straight flight was made, the aircraft taking off without trouble at 50 mph. A second flight was made the following day, when {{it was found that}} the aircraft would not fly faster than about 55 mph. This was blamed on the drag caused by large <b>honeycomb</b> <b>radiators,</b> which were changed to tube radiators mounted on either side of the engine nacelles. A third flight on 31 December revealed a number of control problems, the ailerons and elevators were effective but heavy, partly due to excessive friction in the control circuit and the rudders were seriously overbalanced. After minor modifications, the aircraft was flown to RNAS Eastchurch, where full-speed trials were made. On reaching 70 mph, the tail unit began to vibrate and twist violently; the pilot immediately landed and an inspection showed severe damage to the rear fuselage structure. Reinforcement failed to cure the problem, the enclosed cockpit and most of the armour plating were also removed. The second prototype, 1456, was completed in April 1916 and had an open cockpit in a longer nose with room for a gunner's position. To save weight, most of the armour plating was deleted and was the arrangement for later production of the machine.|$|R

40|$|Wet-bulb-temperature (WBT) {{defines the}} cooling {{distance}} of cooling water in wet cooling towers (or wet <b>honeycomb</b> <b>radiators)</b> at water-cooled power plants. Thus, {{the development of}} WBT in the 21 st century under different scenarios of future climate change is highly relevant for the electricity production sector and is {{examined in this study}} for Germany. We use high-resolution simulated data from the regional climate model REMO. As WBT is no direct model output, it is calculated using dry-bulb-temperature (DBT), relative humidity and surface air pressure using two alternative methods. The iterative method provides better results for validation. The computed WBT is quite close to the observations. It reveals a statistically significant exponential increase until 2100 ranging from 1. 6 degrees C to 2. 4 degrees C in the B 1 scenario and from 2. 6 degrees C to 3. 4 degrees C in the A 2 -scenario. Furthermore the study indicates that changes of the DBT will be the decisive factor for the ! WBT-increase in the 21 st century. Significant differences in the increase of extreme heat events between a region in northern and one in southwestern Germany are highlighted by a threshold analysis. The increase of hourly extreme values in southwestern Germany is about 30 % higher than in the north. A detected west-east gradient is probably related to the North Atlantic Oscillation and a general increase in westerly situations over Germany. The discrepancies between B 1 and A 2 scenario are striking and highlight the impact of different levels of global greenhouse gas emissions on regional climate...|$|R
50|$|Cooling water {{passes through}} a <b>honeycomb</b> <b>radiator</b> and the airflow is {{assisted}} by a fan embodied in the engine's flywheel. Circulation is by thermo-siphon there is no water-pump.|$|E
50|$|An earlier {{construction}} {{method was}} the <b>honeycomb</b> <b>radiator.</b> Round tubes were swaged into hexagons at their ends, then stacked together and soldered. As they only touched at their ends, this formed what became {{in effect a}} solid water tank with many air tubes through it.|$|E
50|$|Many {{of these}} cars {{went off to}} rich export markets, {{including}} the USA. They were popular among wealthy socialites of the time. Featuring a <b>honeycomb</b> <b>radiator</b> (under licence by Mercedes) these cars were {{at the forefront of}} technology - many period articles praised its advanced oiling system.|$|E
5000|$|For streamlining, {{distinctive}} {{features of the}} car are the two small [...] "nostrils", headlights and air inlets in the nose. These produced less drag than a typical inlet and flat <b>honeycomb</b> <b>radiator.</b> The engine was cooled instead by a surface radiator wrapped {{around the top of}} the bodywork, {{just in front of the}} driver.|$|E
5000|$|Cooling was {{provided}} by a pumped water system. Maybach's tubular radiator, patented in 1897, known as a <b>honeycomb</b> <b>radiator,</b> was similar to [...] ones. Its rectangular grille had [...] pipes with a square cross section of 6 mm × 6 mm to improve airflow, and held 9 L of water. The airflow was assisted by a fan located behind the radiator.|$|E
5000|$|The S.63 was {{powered by}} a {{push-pull}} pair of [...] water-cooled Isotta Fraschini Asso 500 V-12 engines. These were mounted high above the wing centre on inward-leaning pairs of N-struts {{and a pair of}} central transverse V-struts, canted strongly upwards and uncowled to reduce fire risk. They shared a single, forward-mounted <b>honeycomb</b> <b>radiator</b> and an oil tank positioned between them.|$|E
50|$|The 1904 Smith and Mabley was a {{touring car}} model. Equipped with a tonneau, it could seat 5 {{passengers}} and sold for US$5500. The vertically mounted water-cooled straight-4, {{at the front}} of the car, produced 18 hp (13.4 kW). A 4-speed transmission was fitted. The wood and angle iron-framed car weighed 1200 lb (544 kg). The car used a <b>honeycomb</b> <b>radiator</b> with a fan.|$|E
5000|$|The {{company was}} in 1910, as the Harrison Radiator Company, by Herbert C. Harrison, an {{inventor}} and entrepreneur. Harrison's technical background in metallurgy and the [...] "Harrison Hexagon" [...] <b>honeycomb</b> <b>radiator</b> had advantages in design (hexagon cellular efficient heat distribution) and manufacturing so that leakages became rare. The first hand-built radiator {{was sold in}} 1911 to the Remington Standard Motor Company of New York.|$|E
5000|$|The LeO H-23 was {{powered by}} a [...] Hispano-Suiza 12N tractor {{configuration}} water-cooled V-12 engine, strut-mounted high above the wing and the cockpit. It was in a long, tapered engine cowling which stretched back almost to the trailing edge but its rectangular <b>honeycomb</b> <b>radiator</b> was immediately behind the propeller, standing proud above the engine. Fuel was in a combination of wing and hull tanks.|$|E
50|$|The Shirl was a two-bay biplane with {{foldable}} fabric-covered wings, without stagger and {{of equal}} span, carrying {{two pairs of}} ailerons. The fuselage was rectangular in cross-section and plywood-covered, in anticipation of ditching {{at the end of}} the mission, since deck landing was not yet practicable. The split-axle undercarriage could be jettisoned for the same situation. The engine was cooled with a <b>honeycomb</b> <b>radiator</b> immediately behind a two-blade propeller.|$|E
50|$|Marius Berliet {{started his}} {{experiments}} with automobiles in 1894. Some single-cylinder cars were followed in 1900 by a twin-cylinder model. In 1902, Berliet {{took over the}} plant of Audibert & Lavirotte in Lyon. Berliet started to build four-cylinder automobiles featured by a <b>honeycomb</b> <b>radiator</b> and steel chassis frame was used instead of wood. The next year, a model was launched that was similar to contemporary Mercedes. In 1906, Berliet sold the licence for manufacturing his model to the American Locomotive Company.|$|E
5000|$|Its {{modified}} Standard fuselage, {{with new}} longerons and covering, now housed a [...] six-cylinder, water-cooled inline Curtiss C-6 engine with a <b>honeycomb</b> <b>radiator</b> {{in front of}} it and a fuel tank in the upper wing. Immediately behind it a new, large, under-wing cockpit with seats for four passengers, two in aft-facing side-by-side seats and two more opposite them. The seats were easily replaceable, allowing the 6W-3 to act as a mailplane. The pilot was in a separate cockpit behind the passengers with a large fairing behind his head.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Senior was a {{welded steel}} tube frame, its forward part covered with light metal and the rear with plywood. Externally it was flat-sided with rounded upper decking. A [...] Liberty L-12 water-cooled V12 engine {{in the nose}} drove a two-bladed, steel Curtiss propeller. Its <b>honeycomb</b> <b>radiator</b> was ahead of the engine, which had long exhaust pipes {{on both sides of}} the fuselage to take the emissions past the pilot. His open cockpit was well behind the trailing edge of the wing. Up to 1000 lb of mail was stored in the space between engine and cockpit.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a cooling}} fan for the <b>honeycomb</b> <b>radiator</b> and the engine {{incorporates}} a pump to ensure the flow of coolant. Lubrication is forced by pump to all the bearings. A float indicator shows the depth {{of oil in the}} crank chamber. Ignition is by High Tension Bosch magneto and may be manually advanced or retarded. The carburettor is by Claudel.The thin steel-cone clutch engages with the Ferodo lined flywheel. The Ferodo linings are in sections which may be replaced individually. The gearbox is suspended at four points. It is operated by a hand lever controlled by a gate and now has four speeds forward and reverse.|$|E
5000|$|In 1986, the bumpers were updated, and the matte {{finished}} surfaces {{were eliminated}} {{for a more}} uniform surface. Rubstripping was increased to 2-inch height w/ scribe detailing. The <b>honeycomb</b> <b>radiator</b> grille was replaced with a slatted version that spanned the entire front end (previous was shorter), and cornerlights were shortened. The [...] "SE" [...] model and the Turbo (Canada, Europe) came with new fiberglass ground effects and mudflaps, painted in {{the color of the}} car, and a new and more pronounced lower deflection lip in the front. All Mark II S12's received a new reverse-cowl hood bulge design to accommodate clearance for the 3.0L V6. Optional rear mudflap accents were available.|$|E
5000|$|The Potez 31 was {{powered by}} a [...] Hispano-Suiza 12G, a W-12 engine, driving a two-blade propeller. A {{partially}} retractable <b>honeycomb</b> <b>radiator</b> was mounted under the fuselage {{at the rear of}} the engine and fuel tanks were in the fuselage over the centre of gravity. It had a tail wheel undercarriage with main wheels on a split axle, centrally supported by a lateral V-strut from the fuselage lower longerons at the base of the forward wing struts. The outer ends were hinged on longitudinally mounted V-struts, the forward member rubber sprung, from the lower fuselage longerons at the bases of the two wing struts.|$|E
5000|$|On one {{occasion}} in 1947, he was transporting his MG R-type to the Brighton Speed Trials, when going {{down a hill}} near Guildford, he ”saw the splendid <b>honeycomb</b> <b>radiator</b> of a Bugatti in the outside rear-view mirror” , so he moved over and waved it past. But the car hung back. Further down the hill, the Bugatti accelerated and drew level with Hamilton, at which point he saw {{there was no one}} in it: ”The awful truth dawned on me - it was my own car, gathering speed fast.” [...] Duncan had forgotten he was towing the Bugatti, and the story ends with a lamppost snapped in two.|$|E
50|$|The 2.6 Litre {{long-stroke}} engine {{has eight}} cylinders in line, their {{bore and stroke}} 63 mm by 105 mm. The eight pistons are aluminium alloy and die cast. The overhead valves operate by pushrods, the valve gear and all other parts that need it receive forced lubrication. Timing is controlled by chain which also has a positive oil feed. The oil's pressure may be varied by hand {{and there is a}} float oil-level indicator on the right hand side. An impeller made as part of the fan assembly circulates cooling water to the <b>honeycomb</b> <b>radiator</b> which is protected by a shell and has thermostatically controlled shutters in the grille in front of it.|$|E
5000|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Mureaux {{was built}} around four duralumin tube longerons, with easily repaired connections to tubular diagonals and with removable panels covering the forward part. Two removable engine mountings allowed either a [...] Hispano-Suiza 12Hb V-12, a type often identified {{at the time}} as the V-12 500 hp (its officially approved power) Hispano-Suiza, [...] or a water-cooled [...] Salmson 18 Cm radial engine to be fitted. Both engine types used an adjustable <b>honeycomb</b> <b>radiator</b> projecting from the fuselage underside and were fed fuel from a jettisonable tank behind the engine and ahead of the engine firewall. The Hispano version was designated the Les Mureaux 3 and the Salmson powered aircraft Les Mureaux 4, the latter 78 kg heavier.|$|E
5000|$|The H.2 was {{designed}} to be powered by a , water-cooled V-12 Rolls-Royce Eagle IX engine mounted in the nose, though the only completed prototype had a [...] Eagle VII because of Handasyde's limited finances. Its <b>honeycomb</b> <b>radiator</b> was mounted underneath the cowling between the forward undercarriage struts. Behind the engine the fuselage was flat-sided and deep, with the pilot in an open cockpit recessed into the wing leading edge. The passenger cabin was behind the pilot and under the wing, entered by forward doors on each side. There were three seats on each side, each with a window; the cabin had a forward space for luggage and a toilet at the rear. In an emergency passengers could escape through a roof trapdoor at the wing trailing edge.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of {{the fuselage}} {{was based on}} a cross-braced, rectangular section steel frame. Its Junkers L5 engine was mounted in the nose and neatly cowled, with its oil tank aft of a firewall and a retractable <b>honeycomb</b> <b>radiator</b> on the fuselage underside. The region behind the engine contained an enclosed cockpit over the leading edge and a cabin which extended back to the trailing edge; the sides of this part of the fuselage were dural covered and its slightly shaped upper and lower surfaces canvas covered. The rear fuselage was entirely canvas covered. The cockpit contained two side-by-side seats provided with dual controls and was accessed via the cabin. This was a space 2.35 m long, 1.30 m wide and 1.50 m high, which could seat four, each with their own window, or be used to carry freight or mail. Aft of the cabin there was a small entry lobby with a port-side door and a facing, enclosed, toilet.|$|E
5000|$|According to {{historian}} Richard Hough, [...] "Any {{history of}} the sports car must begin with the 60 hp Mércèdes of 1903. In the 60 hp model, described {{at the time as}} a fast touring car, Wilhelm Maybach and Paul Daimler combined in remarkably successful form a number of features which were to be slavishly imitated, first in Europe and later in America, for almost forty years. These included a pressed-steel chassis, a 4-speed gate change, <b>honeycomb</b> <b>radiator,</b> push-rod-operated overhead inlet valves, low-tension magneto ignition and a remarkably successful suspension arrangement. They were integrated with success to provide a safe and well-balanced machine with a higher performance than any other contemporary production car. The 60 hp Mércèdes looked right from the start and caused a great impression wherever it appeared." [...] When the specially built 90 hp racing car for the 1903 Gordon Bennett race was destroyed in a fire, a production 60 hp was famously substituted and driven to victory by Belgian Camille Jenatzy.|$|E
5000|$|The Potez 50 and its {{variants}} were {{powered by}} five different nose mounted engines, two inlines and three radials, detailed below. The {{first of these}} was a [...] Lorraine 12Fd Courlis water-cooled W-12 engine, enclosed by a close fitting metal cowling which followed the contours of its three-cylinder banks. There was a large, rectangular, <b>honeycomb</b> <b>radiator</b> on the fuselage underside {{at the rear of}} the engine, equipped with a shutter. Behind the engine the fuselage was built around four longerons making it flat sided though with rounded ply decking; the central part of the fuselage around the cockpits was also ply skinned, with fabric aft. The pilot's open cockpit was under an angular cut-out in the upper trailing edge which widened his field of view; he controlled a fixed, forward firing machine gun and the gunner/observer's position close behind had a pair of machine guns on a flexible mount as well as radio and photographic equipment.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} {{motoring}} days when series production {{did not yet}} exist the process of acquiring a new vehicle needed two major decisions, selection of a vehicle manufacturer and selection of a coachbuilder. Already accustomed to ordering carriages from a coachbuilder, the buyer would select an automobile manufacturer which might supply their own catalogued bodies but which {{would be expected to}} provide primarily only a bare [...] "chassis". This [...] "chassis" [...] would be delivered by the manufacturer to the coachbuilder of the buyer's choice. The [...] "chassis" [...] would be a rolling chassis which included the chassis frame, drivetrain (engine, gearbox, differential, axles, wheels), brakes, suspension, complete steering system including the wheel, radiator, scuttle and dashboard. The manufacturer delivered the chassis with lighting system, spare wheel(s) (but probably without tyres), front and rear mudguards and (later) bumpers. The very easily damaged <b>honeycomb</b> <b>radiator,</b> later enclosed and protected by a shell, became the main visual element identifying the chassis' brand. The manufacturer retained an element of control over bodies. Bodies not approved by the chassis manufacturer would lose the chassis manufacturer's chassis warranties.|$|E
5000|$|It had a nose-mounted, [...] Lorraine 12E Courlis W-12 engine {{water-cooled}} with a <b>honeycomb</b> <b>radiator</b> and a Lamblin {{oil cooler}} on the fuselage underside. The forward fuselage was ash framed, changing to pine aft. In the engine area {{it was covered}} with aluminium, the central part was fabric covered and the rear plywood skinned. The upper fuselage had a light, rounded wooden decking. There were two, tandem, open cockpits close to each other, with the forward one, from which it was flown, between the trailing edges.The upper edge had a rounded, almost semicircular cut out to improve the pilot's upward view and the lower edges had quadrantal cut-outs at the roots for downward vision. The rear cockpit had provision for a machine gun mounting. The fuselage tapered aft to conventional, unbalanced tail surfaces with a continuously curved tailplane and elevators positioned {{near the top of}} the fuselage. The fin and rudder were also smoothly curved together; the latter extended to the keel and worked in a rounded elevator cut-out.|$|E
