Spence is bitten by a zombie, which he kills before trapping the survivors in the lab. He retrieves the anti-virus, but is ambushed and killed by a Licker. The Red Queen offers to spare Alice and Matt if they kill Rain, whose health <b>is</b> <b>fading</b> and who has been infected too long for the anti-virus to work reliably. As the Licker attempts to reach them, a power outage occurs. The lab door opens to reveal Kaplan forced the Red Queen to open the door. The group heads to the train, where Alice retrieves the T-virus and kills a reanimated Spence before escaping with the others.|$|E

25|$|Although some {{consider}} that the distinction between transpersonal psychology and the psychology of religion, <b>is</b> <b>fading</b> (e.g. The Oxford Handbook of Psychology and Spirituality), there is still {{generally considered to be}} a clear distinction between the two. Much of the focus of psychology of religion is concerned with issues that wouldn't be considered 'transcendent' within transpersonal psychology, so the two disciplines do have quite a distinct focus.|$|E

25|$|There {{is nothing}} solid {{left in the}} Players' Protective Association. There has been no {{activity}} {{on the part of}} the present officials, and there will be none. The organization has been allowed to die because the members have seen nothing in it to interest them. Some are not pleased with the officers; others object to the paying of dues, while others still believe that they can do better by themselves than by acting in concert with all the other players; and so the Players' Protective Association gradually is being allowed to die out. One hears but little of it now, and in a year from now will hear less. It would have been a good thing for the players if they had been true to its principles and the officials had been active in carrying out all its aims and laws. However, there was failure on all sides, and the result is that the organization gradually <b>is</b> <b>fading</b> out of existence.|$|E
25|$|About 2,000 {{artisans}} such as Jose Garcia Quinones in Tlaquepaque {{preserve the}} tradition of making nativity scenes and other figures from clay. These nativity scenes can be whimsical with non-tradition animals such as lions and giraffe and even the Devil can appear. Garcia Quinones has won prizes for his work {{since he was a}} boy and each year for thirty year has sold his wars at the annual Christmas Bazaar at the Deportivo Venustiano Carranza sports facility. Like other potters, the pieces are made at a home workshop with all members of the family contributing to the creation. Another potter, Justino Estuvier, over 70 years old, exports his finely crafted wares to Spain. However, this aspect of the ceramics industry <b>is</b> <b>fading</b> in the municipality with far fewer potters than there used to be. Common artisans here battle to survive against the proliferation of plastic and cheaper ceramics from Asia. The average handcrafted nativity scene sells in Mexico for 350 pesos, when cheaper mass-produced ones sell for 160.|$|E
25|$|Polovtsian maidens sing {{comparing}} love to {{a flower}} that droops {{in the heat}} of the day and is revived by night. They dance together (Dance of the Polovtsian Maidens). Konchakovna joins in the singing hoping that her own lover will join her soon (Konchakovna's Cavatina). The Russian prisoners arrive from their day's work and express their gratitude when fed by Konchakovna and the maidens. Their guards retire for the night leaving just Ovlur, a Christian, in charge. Vladimir, son of Igor, sings of his hope that his love will soon join him now that the day <b>is</b> <b>fading</b> (Vladimir's Cavatina). His love is Konchakovna. She comes and the two sing of their love and their desire to marry (Love Duet). While her father will consent to the marriage, they know that his will not. They part when they hear Igor coming. He sings of his disgrace and torment at being captured with his followers dead (Prince Igor's Aria). Only his wife, he feels, will be loyal. He hopes for the chance to regain his honour. Ovlur urges Igor to escape and the prince agrees to think about it. Khan Konchak asks him if all is well (Konchak's Aria) and he replies that the falcon cannot live in captivity. Konchak says that as Igor did not ask for mercy he is not a prisoner but an honoured guest equal to a Khan. Igor reminds him that he too knows what it is to be a captive. Konchak offers Igor freedom if he will promise not to wage war on him again, but he refuses saying he cannot lie. Konchak regrets that they were not born to be allies. They would then have captured all of Russia. He summons the Polovtsian slaves to entertain Igor and himself and offers Igor his choice of them. As the slaves dance the Polovtsy sing of Konchak's glory (Polovtsian Dances).|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Hold Me Now" [...] was {{directed}} by Rupert James, produced by Tim Bevan, and edited by Brian Grant and Nick Morris. [...] The video features the Thompson Twins in a set with a blue background. [...] Each member is standing on a platform, singing or playing a different instrument, a guitar or a piano for Bailey, a Marimba or another percussion instrument for Currie, and a bass guitar or congas for Leeway. [...] The video is heavily edited, with frames sliding from the sides, doubling or tripling, split-screen edits, and close-ups of the band while singing or dancing. [...] At the end the background changes from blue to red, and the three members are featured together singing and clapping while the song <b>is</b> <b>fading</b> out.|$|E

While China has invested {{the equivalent of about}} $10 billion per year into nuclear power in recent years, in 2010 it spent twice as much on wind energy alone and some $54.5 billion on all renewables combined.|$|E

2500|$|P.G.L. Dirichlet {{published}} his works in both French and German. The strict original meaning {{of either the}} German , or the French , corresponds to the English , an open-topped box that can be slid {{in and out of}} the cabinet that contains it. These terms were morphed to the word , standing for a small open space in a desk, cabinet, or wall for keeping letters or papers, metaphorically rooted in the structures that house pigeons. Considering the fact that Dirichlet's father was a postmaster, necessarily best acquainted to furniture of type pigeonhole, common for sorting letters in his business, the translation by pigeonholes may be a perfect transfer of Dirichlet's terms of understanding. The meaning, referring to some furniture features, has since been strongly overtaken and <b>is</b> <b>fading,</b> especially among those who do not speak English natively, but as a lingua franca in the scientific world, in favour of the more pictorial interpretation, literally involving pigeons and holes. It is interesting to note that the suggestive, though not misleading interpretation of [...] "pigeonhole" [...] as [...] "dovecote" [...] has lately found its way back to a German [...] "re-translation" [...] of the [...] "pigeonhole"-principle as the [...] "Taubenschlag"-principle.|$|E
2500|$|Today, {{only about}} 5,000 chinampas, all {{affixed to the}} lake bottom, still exist in their {{original}} form, surrounded by canals and used for agriculture. The rest have become solid ground and urbanized. In the center of Xochimilco, there are about 200 chinampas, covering an area of 1,800 hectares. However, one reason the number has decreased is that smaller chinampas have been combined to create larger ones. While there are still those who maintain chinampas traditionally, and use them for agriculture, the chinampa culture <b>is</b> <b>fading</b> in the borough with many being urbanized, and being turned into soccer fields, and sites for housing and businesses. The deterioration {{of many of these}} chinampas can be seen as their edges erode into the dark, polluted water of the canals. The most deteriorated chinampas are located in the communities of Santa María Nativitas, Santa Cruz Acalpixca, San Gregoria Atlapulco and Ejido de Xochimilco. Together, these have a total of thirty eight illegal settlements. To repair a number of chinampas, the borough along with federal authorities, has reinforced forty two km of shoreline, of the [...] that exist in the lake area. This involves the planting of juniper trees and the sinking of tezontle pylons into the lakebed.|$|E
