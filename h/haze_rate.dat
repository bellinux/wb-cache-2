40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{investigation}} is to analyze the efficiency and safety of preventive intraoperative administration of Prospidinum to prevent subepithelial haze after photorefractive keratectomy. Materials and methods. The basic group consisted of 69 patients (118 eyes) with myopia from 1. 5 to 10. 0 diopter, mean age 25. 0 ± 7. 5 years, who underwent photorefractive keratectomy with application of 2. 5 % Prospidinum solution on cornea after ablation. In the control group there were 70 patients (118 eyes) with myopia from 2. 25 to 8. 5 diopter operated earlier without Prospidinum application. To correct myopia Excimer laser MEL- 70 G-Scan (Aesculap Meditec, Germany) was used in all cases. Results. Epithelialization periods were the same in both groups. The basic group (118 eyes) had none complications related to Prospidinum application. Early corneal haze was observed postoperatively in the basic group in 11. 8 % of cases, {{in the control group}} — in 24. 5 % of patients. 1. 7 % of patients in the basic group had late haze, and 6. 7 % — in the control group. 6. 7 % and 15. 25 % of patients respectively, had partial regress of refraction result. Mean noncorrected acuity of vision after the operation was 0. 85 ± 0. 27 in the basic group, and 0. 76 ± 0. 21 — in the control group. Conclusion. Prospidinum (2. 5 % solution) applied on photoablation zone for 30 s in photorefractive keratectomy statistically significantly reduces subepithelial <b>haze</b> <b>rate...</b>|$|E
40|$|Extensive studies characterizing Titan {{present an}} {{opportunity}} to study the atmospheric properties of Titan-like exoplanets. Using an existing model of Titan's atmospheric haze, we computed geometric albedo spectra and effective transit height spectra for six values of the <b>haze</b> production <b>rate</b> (zero <b>haze</b> to twice present) {{over a wide range}} of wavelengths (0. 2 - 2 microns). In the geometric albedo spectra, the slope in the UV-visible changes from blue to red when varying the <b>haze</b> production <b>rate</b> values from zero to twice the current Titan value. This spectral feature is {{the most effective way to}} characterize the <b>haze</b> production <b>rates.</b> Methane absorption bands in the visible-NIR compete with the absorbing haze, being more prominent for smaller <b>haze</b> production <b>rates.</b> The effective transit heights probe a region of the atmosphere where the haze and gas are optically thin and that is thus not effectively probed by the geometric albedo. The effective transit height decreases smoothly with increasing wavelength, from 376 km to 123 km at 0. 2 and 2 microns, respectively. When decreasing the <b>haze</b> production <b>rate,</b> the methane absorption bands become more prominent, and the effective transit height decreases with a steeper slope with increasing wavelength. The slope of the geometric albedo in the UV-visible increases smoothly with increasing <b>haze</b> production <b>rate,</b> while the slope of the effective transit height spectra is not sensitive to the <b>haze</b> production <b>rate</b> other than showing a sharp rise when the <b>haze</b> production <b>rate</b> increases from zero. We conclude that geometric albedo spectra provide the most sensitive indicator of the <b>haze</b> production <b>rate</b> and the background Rayleigh gas. Our results suggest that important and complementary information can be obtained from the geometric albedo and motivates improvements in the technology for direct imaging of nearby exoplanets...|$|R

The total production rate is insensitive to within a factor of two to order of magnitude changes in the eddy diffusion coefficient and methane mixing ratio, which is within the present estimate of uncertainty for this number. The condensation temperatures are 97 K for C 4 H 2, 71 K for C 2 H 2, and 64 K for C 2 H 6.

40|$|Methane is photolyzed by {{the solar}} UV in the {{stratosphere}} of Saturn. Subsequent photochemistry leads {{to the production of}} acetylene (C 2 H 2) and diacetylene (C 4 H 2). These species are produced where it is relatively warm (T is {{greater than or equal to}} 140 K), but the tropopause temperature of Saturn (approximately 80 K) is low enough that these two species may freeze out to their respective ices. Numerical models which include both photochemistry and condensation loss make predictions about the mixing ratios of these species and <b>haze</b> production <b>rates.</b> These models are dependent upon knowing reaction pathways and their associated kinetic reaction rate constants and vapor pressures.

30|$|With {{regard to}} sand sources as I discuss in the {{following}} Section, the bottom-up approach allows for a single sand source (haze fallout) distributed across the entire globe. That source would yield sand fluxes proportional to the <b>haze</b> accumulation <b>rate</b> at each point. Thus no individual sand sources should be identifiable. As a corrolary, however, all of that sand needs to find its {{way down to the}} equatorial sand seas. This transport might be expected to manifest as barchan dunes marching from the pole toward the equator, where the sand that they transport would then be subsumed within the giant longitudinal dunefields. Because these barchan dunes should be of order 30 - 300 m in size, they would not be detectable by Cassini. Sand sheets could also serve as a means to deliver sand to the equator, however the mid-latitudes show a spectral signature that does not match that of the sand seas. Future missions, including airplanes [32], hot-air balloons [33], and high-resolution space-borne imaging [34] would be capable of detecting and characterizing such barchans, should they exist.|$|R
40|$|Titan's organic haze is {{potentially}} an important sink of photochemically produced carbon and nitrogen compounds. An assortment of microphysical haze models all {{suggest that the}} <b>haze</b> production <b>rate</b> is 10 (exp - 14) gm per square centimeter per second, within a factor of two. Spectral analysis of laboratory tholins compared to Titan's geometric albedo spectrum suggest that the laboratory material is a good analog to Titan's haze. The laboratory material has an elemental composition given approximately by C 4 H 4 N, with an uncertainty in the C/N ratio of a factor of two. Thus, the haze represents a sink for C of 4 x 10 (exp 8) per square centimeter per second, and a sink for N of 1 x 10 (exp 8) per square centimeter per second. The C sink is small compared to condensation of hydrocarbons but the sink for N {{is comparable to the}} total production rate of HCN. Because estimates of the eddy diffusion profile on Titan have been based on the HCN profile, inclusion of this additional sink for N will affect estimates for all transport processes in Titan's atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} a {{one-dimensional}} methane photochemical model to analyze Voyager observations of hydrocarbons and hazes in the stratosphere of Neptune. Vayager IRIS spectra provide information about the global average C 2 H 2 and C 2 H 6 mixing ratios for p > 0. 1 mbar. The UVS lightcurves provide constraints on CH 4 and C 2 H 4 in addition to C 2 H 2 and C 2 H 6 but only at the solar occultation latitudes and for lower pressures. The model-predicted hydrocarbons {{are very sensitive to}} the height profile of the eddy diffusion coefficient (K). For both data sets K varying inversely with the atmospheric number density to some power produced poor results. Good agreement with the data requires that K be weak in the lower stratosphere (K [similar, equals] 2 x 103 cm 2 sec- 1 for p[greater, not approximate] 2 mbar) but fairly vigorous in the upper stratosphere (K > 5 x 107 cm 2 sec- 1 for p[less, not approximate] 0. 5 mbar), i. e., a rapidly mixed upper stratosphere overlying a stagnant lower stratosphere with a rapid transition in between. The model C 2 H 6 and C 2 H 2 mixing ratios are also sensitive to the reaction rate constants of C 2 H 4 + H and CH 3 + C 2 H 3. Notably, we must use the present upper limit for the C 2 H 4 + H rate to best fit the model results to the observations. We are able to reproduce the IRIS C 2 H 2 and C 2 H 6 emission features well, less so the UVS occultation lightcurves. Since the transport of C 2 H 2, C 2 H 6, and other hydrocarbons produced from methane photolysis out of the stratosphere is by ice haze formation and sedimentation, we compared model haze predictions to PPS and IRIS observations. For solar maximum fluxes (Voyager encounter conditions) the model mass production rate is 1 x 10 - 14 g cm 2 sec- 1. C 2 H 6 is the dominant haze component (75 %), with the remainder coming from C 2 H 2 and C 3 and C 4 compounds. Balancing the above <b>haze</b> production <b>rate</b> by the sedimentation rate for 0. 25 -[mu]m radius particles (upper limit to particle radius from PPS observations) yields a total haze column burden slightly above the PPS upper limit. However, lifetime analysis indicates that the model <b>haze</b> production <b>rate</b> should be averaged over solar minimum and maximum conditions. Under these conditions the model haze density is consistent with the PPS data. The predicted C 4 H 2 and C 2 H 6 haze column densities are consistent with the lack of ice signatures in the IRIS spectra...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{solar system}} atmospheres possess {{aerosols}} including the characteristic organic hazes of Titan and Pluto. Haze particles substantially impact atmospheric temperatures structures and may provide organic {{material to the}} surface of a world, thereby affecting its habitability. Observations of exoplanet atmospheres suggest the presence of aerosols, especially in cooler (< 800 K), smaller (< 0. 3 times Jupiter's mass) exoplanets. It remains unclear if the aerosols muting the spectroscopic features of exoplanet atmospheres are condensate clouds or photochemical hazes, which is difficult to predict from theory alone. We present here the first laboratory haze simulation experiments for atmospheric compositions expected for super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. We explored temperatures from 300 to 600 K and a range of atmospheric metallicities (100 x, 1000 x, 10000 x solar); all simulated atmospheres produced particles, and the cooler (300 and 400 K) 1000 x solar metallicity ("H 2 O-dominated", CH 4 -rich) experiments exhibited <b>haze</b> production <b>rates</b> higher than our standard Titan simulation (~ 10 mg/hr versus 7. 4 mg/hr for Titan). However the particle production rates varied greatly, with measured rates as low as 0. 04 mg/hr (100 x solar metallicity, 600 K). Here we show that we should expect some, but not all, super-Earth and mini-Neptune atmospheres to possess a thick photochemically generated haze.

40|$|Analysis of high-spatial-resolution (approximately 0. 8 arcsec) methane {{band and}} {{continuum}} imagery of Neptune's relatively homogeneous Equatorial Region yields significant constraints on (1) the stratospheric gaseous methane mixing ratio (f(sub CH 4, S)), (2) the column abundances and optical properties of stratospheric and tropospheric hydrocarbon hazes, and (3) the wavelength-dependent single-scattering albedo of the 3 -bar opaque cloud. From the center-to-limb {{behavior of the}} 7270 -A and 8900 -A CH 4 bands, the stratospheric methane mixing ratios is limited to f(sub CH 4, S) less than 1. 7 x 10 (exp - 3), with a nominal value of f(sub CH 4, S) = 3. 5 x 10 (exp - 4), one to two orders of magnitude less than pre-Voyager estimates, but in agreement {{with a number of}} recent ultraviolet and thermal infrared measurements, and largely in agreement with the tropopause mixing ratio implied by Voyager temperature measurements. Upper limits to the stratospheric haze mass column abundance and 6190 -A and 8900 -A haze opacities are 0. 61 micrograms/sq cm and 0. 075 and 0. 042, respectively, with nominal values of 0. 20 micrograms/sq cm and 0. 025 and 0. 014 for the 0. 2 micrometers radius particles preferred by the recent Voyager PPS analysis of Pryor et al. (1992). The tropospheric CH 4 haze opacities are comparable to that found in the stratosphere, i. e., upper limits of 0. 104 and 0. 065 at 6190 A and 8900 A, respectively, with nominal values of 0. 085 and 0. 058. This indicates a column abundance less than 11. 0 micrograms/sq cm, corresponding to the methane gas content within a well-mixed 3 % methane tropospheric layer only 0. 1 cm thick near the 1. 5 -bar CH 4 condensation level. Conservative scattering is ruled out for the opaque cloud near 3 bars marking the bottom of the visible atmosphere. Specifically, we find cloud single-scattering albedos of 0. 915 +/- 0. 006 at 6340 A, 0. 775 +/- 0. 012 at 7490 A, and 0. 803 +/- 0. 010 at 8260 A. Global models utilizing a complete global spectrum confirm the red-absorbing character of the 3 -bar cloud. The global-mean model has approximately 7. 7 times greater stratospheric aerosol content than the Equatorial Region. An analysis of stratospheric <b>haze</b> precipitation <b>rates</b> indicates a steady-state <b>haze</b> production <b>rate</b> of 0. 185 - 1. 5 x 10 (exp - 14) g/sq cm/s, in agreement with recent theoretical photochemical estimates. Finally, reanalysis of the Voyager PPS 7500 -A phase angle data utilizing the f(sub CH 4, S) value derived here confirms the Pryor et al. result of a tropospheric CH 4 haze opacity of a few tenths in the 22 - 30 degs S latitude region, several times that of the Equatorial Region or of the globe. The factor-of- 10 reduction in f(sub CH 4, S) below that assumed by Pryor et al. implies decreased gas absorption and consequently a decrease in the forward-scattering component of tropospheric aerosols...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA star {{occultation}} by Pluto was monitored in August 2003 by several telescopes, at several wavelengths between 0. 7 μm and 2. 23 μm. Besides information concerning pressure and temperature profiles, this observation revealed a chromatic {{effect in the}} light transmitted through the atmosphere at the limb. It was attributed to an extinction layer produced by spherical particles of about 0. 2 μm, and {{it was suggested that}} such large particle size may be due to fractal particles as on Titan. In this paper, we use an aerosol microphysical model to estimate if such extinction could be due to photochemical aerosols only. We use the case of Titan to scale the <b>haze</b> production <b>rate</b> on Pluto and we show that the chromatic effect {{is not likely to be}} produced in this way. We then study how a troposphere in Pluto's atmosphere could generate condensation droplets. We conclude that such an extinction layer is produced by condensation droplets that potentially could grow as large as observed. We find that only N 2 and CO are able to condense easily. CH 4 probably does not condense or, if it does, it needs to reach a very high saturation ratio and, in any case, is supersaturated on Pluto. Noteworthily, a similar layer was observed on Triton by Voyager. Finally, at the end of the paper we discuss which are the conditions to detect a chromatic effect for submicrometer to micrometer particles in future observations...|$|R
40|$|With the {{discovery}} of ever smaller and colder exoplanets, terrestrial worlds with hazy atmospheres must be increasingly considered. Our Solar System's Titan is a prototypical hazy planet, whose atmosphere may be representative {{of a large number}} of planets in our Galaxy. As a step towards characterizing such worlds, we present simulations of exoplanets that resemble Titan, but orbit three different stellar hosts: G-, K-, and M-dwarf stars. We use general circulation and photochemistry models to explore the circulation and chemistry of these Titan-like planets under varying stellar spectra, in all cases assuming a Titan-like insolation. Due to the strong absorption of visible light by atmospheric haze, the redder radiation accompanying later stellar types produces more isothermal stratospheres, stronger meridional temperature gradients at mbar pressures, and deeper and stronger zonal winds. In all cases, the planets' atmospheres are strongly superrotating, but meridional circulation cells are weaker aloft under redder starlight. The photochemistry of hydrocarbon and nitrile species varies with stellar spectra, with variations in the FUV/NUV flux ratio playing an important role. Our results tentatively suggest that column <b>haze</b> production <b>rates</b> could be similar under all three hosts, implying that planets around many different stars could have similar characteristics to Titan's atmosphere. Lastly, we present theoretical emission spectra. Overall, our study indicates that, despite important and subtle differences, the circulation and chemistry of Titan-like exoplanets are relatively insensitive to differences in host star. These findings may be further probed with future space-based facilities, like WFIRST, LUVOIR, HabEx, and OST. Comment: Accepted to Ap...|$|R
40|$|We have {{inverted}} high-phase-angle Voyager {{images of}} Neptune {{to determine the}} atmospheric extinction coefficient {{as a function of}} altitude and the scattering phase function at a reference altitude. Comparisons between theoretical model and observations help separate the contributions from molecular Rayleigh and aerosol scattering and help determine the variation of the aerosol size, concentration, and scattering properties with altitude. Further comparisons between models and data allow us to place constraints on the location and composition of the hazes, the concentration and downward flux of certain condensible hydrocarbon gases, the eddy diffusion coefficient in the lower stratosphere, and the thermal profile in parts of Neptune's stratosphere. We find that a distinct stratospheric haze layer exists near 12 (sub - 1, sup + 1) mbar in Neptune's lower stratosphere, most probably due to condensed ethane. The derived stratospheric <b>haze</b> production <b>rate</b> of 1. 0 (sub - 0. 3, sup + 0. 2) x 10 (exp - 15) g cm(exp - 2) sec(exp - 1) is substantially lower than photochemical model predictions. Evidence for hazes at higher altitudes also exists. Unlike the situation on Uranus, large particles (0. 08 - 0. 11 microns) may be present at high altitudes on Neptune (e. g., near 0. 5 mbar), well above the region in which we expect the major hydrocarbon species to condense. Near 28 mbar, the mean particle size is about 0. 13 (sub - 0. 02, sup + 0. 02) microns with a concentration of 5 (sub - 3, sup + 3) particles cm(exp - 3). The cumulative haze extinction optical depth above 15 mbar in the clear filter is approx. 3 x 10 (exp - 3), and much of this extinction is due to scattering rather than absorption; thus, if our limb-scan sites are typical, the hazes cannot account for the stratospheric temperature inversion on Neptune and may not contribute significantly to atmospheric heating. We compare the imaging results with the results from other observations, including those of the Voyager Photopolarimeter Subsystem, and discuss differences between Neptune and Uranus...|$|R
