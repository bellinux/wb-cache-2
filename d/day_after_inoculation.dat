Seis outros animais, dois de cada espécie, foram mantidos como testemunhas. As alterações clínicas surgidas a partir do 3 º dia após inoculação (DAI) foram: hipertermia, taquicardia, taquipnéia, anorexia, prostração, corrimento nasal e lacrimejamento. Estes sinais foram mais evidentes nos taurinos, espécie que apresentou, ainda, diarréia, fotofobia e conjuntivite. Foi possível isolar T. gondii da corrente sangüínea em todas as espécies. Nos taurinos, a partir do 5 º DAI até o final do experimento, o parasito foi isolado de todas as amostras de sangue colhidas semanalmente, com exceção do 14 º, 35 º e 63 º DAI. Os bubalinos apresentaram parasitemia no 7 º, 14 º, 35 º e 70 º DAI e os zebuínos apenas no 7 º e 28 º DAI, correspondendo aos picos de temperatura, em todas as espécies, sendo mais evidente em taurinos. Os parâmetros clínico-laboratoriais demonstraram que os taurinos foram mais sensíveis ao T. gondii do que os zebuínos e estes não diferiram significativamente dos bubalinos, que tiveram aparente normalidade clínico-laboratorial.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to identify potential mechanisms that might account for the greater susceptibility of neonatal rats (5 days old) as compared with weanling rats (25 days old) to viral-induced lung injury. Sites of viral replication, the sequential development of bronchiolitis and pneumonia, and systemic humoral immune responses were compared between neonatal and weanling rats from 2 to 17 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> being inoculated intranasally with parainfluenza Type 1 (Sendai) virus. In both neonatal and weanling rats, viral antigen was demonstrated by immunoperoxidase technique and viral nucleocapsids, and budding virions were demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy in bronchiolar ciliated and nonciliated epithelial cells as early as 2 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation.</b> Similar evidence of viral replication was also demonstrated in both ages of rats in alveolar Type I and Type II epithelial cells and in macrophages. Neither virus nor viral antigens was identified in endothelial cells or interstitial cells of interalveolar septa. Bronchiolitis was induced as early as 2 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation</b> in both ages of rats and was characterized by necrosis, erosion, and hyperplasia of epithelial cells. Multifocal to locally extensive interstitial pneumonia centered on bronchioles, was characterized by alveolar epithelial cell damage and by infiltration of neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes in alveolar septa and spaces and was observed as early as 2 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation</b> in both age groups of rats. Interstitial pneumonia of maximal severity occurred in weanling rats at 5 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation,</b> whereas maximal pneumonia of comparable severity occurred in neonatal rats at 8 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation.</b> Epithelial repair and resolution of bronchiolitis and pneumonia were largely complete in both ages of rats by 17 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation.</b> Virus was recovered from lung homogenates of neonatal and weanling rats as early as 2 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation.</b> In weanling rats, infective virus could not be recovered from lung beyond 6 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation,</b> whereas in neonatal rats virus could be recovered from lung as late as 10 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation.</b> Viral persistence in neonatal rats was associated with a delayed onset of serum antibody to the virus, compared with weanling rats.

The reticular fibers in the liver were intact in almost all cases. In the regressive parts of the liver, decrease or disappearance in PNA were observed, but conversely, R. E. S. cells in the sinusoids were increased in PNA. The characteristic nuclear inclusions of this disease occurred in almost all germinal layers, such as vascular endothelia (mesoderm), adventitial cells, reticulum cells and histiocytes (mesenchyma), liver cells, bronchial epithelia, bile duct epithelia (entoderm), mucosa epithelia in the tonsils (ectoderm), and serosa epithelia in the digestive canals and urinary bladder, epithelia in the heart and epithelia in the adrenal cortex (mesoderm). No inclusion bodies could be seen in the bronchial epithelium and epithelium of membrana nictitans as in spontaneous cases.

40|$|Four-year-old {{seedlings}} of Pinus thunbergii, Pinus densiflora and Pinus rigida were inoculated with Fusarium circinatum isolate (FT- 7), {{the pitch}} canker fungus, from P. thunbergii, {{to evaluate the}} effects of the pathogen on disease development and gas exchange rate. Needle dehydration was evident on 2 of 10 seedlings of P. thunbergii and P. rigida at 18 and 21 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation,</b> respectively, while no symptoms were observed in P. densiflora seedlings throughout the experiment. Gas exchange stopped completely in 4 of 5 measured seedlings of P. thunbergii and 2 of 5 measured seedlings of P. rigida at 25 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation,</b> and in the remaining 3 seedlings of P. rigida at 39 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation.</b> Disease development in P. thunbergii seedlings was faster than that in P. rigida seedlings. By the time, the experiment was ended at 78 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation,</b> 9 of 10 seedlings of P. rigida and 8 of 10 seedlings of P. thunbergii seedlings treated with FT- 7 was almost dead, but all seedlings of P. densiflora were still healthy. We suggest that P. densiflora is resistant to F. circinatum in the current study, and gas exchange rate of the species <b>after</b> <b>inoculation</b> does not differ significantly compared to that of untreated control...|$|R
40|$|Fusarium wilt is {{a severe}} disease of banana plants {{caused by the}} fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to trace the pathway and colonization in roots and rhizome of the highly susceptible banana cultivar, ‘Nanjangud Rasabale’. We observed that the entry of the fungus into the roots is primarily through the rootlet, progressing upwards to the rhizome and p seudostem. External symptoms of characteristic yellowing of the lower leaf sheath were observed only <b>after</b> 90 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation</b> though internally the colonization of the fungus had occurred as early as 45 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation.</b> ongitudinal splitting of the out er leaf bases just above soil level was seen only <b>after</b> 150 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation.</b> Formation of chlamydospores, microconidia were observed in root and rhizome sections. Macroconidial formation was observed in only preserved root and rhizome samples...|$|R
40|$|The {{method of}} {{preserving}} detached wheat leaves in Petri dish {{was used for}} the inoculation and development of the fungus Puccinia triticina, the causal agent of wheat leaf rust. The reaction of 26 wheat cultivars was compared by using seedlings cultivated in pots (in vivo) and detached leaves (in vitro) inoculated with four physiological races of the pathogen. After inoculation, the material was kept in a growth chamber for 15 days. The reaction was evaluated on the 15 th <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation.</b> Results for each race in the evaluated genotypes confirmed the efficiency of the detached leaf method in assessing the reaction of wheat cultivars...|$|E

This paper contains the results of an investigation into the appearance and pattern of haemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies in the serum of rhesus monkeys inoculated intracerebrally with the 17 D strain of yellow fever virus during the testing of seed lots of yellow fever vaccine. These antibodies appeared on the tenth <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation,</b> and were still demonstrable four years later. In all of the eight monkeys tested complement-fixing and neutralizing antibodies against yellow fever antigens also developed, and in six out of the eight heterologous antigens developed...|$|E
40|$|The {{acute and}} chronic effects of {{infection}} with Coxsackie virus B 4 are described for the mural endocardium and valves of 170 mice for selected periods from 1 - 210 {{days after a}} single i. p. inoculation of Coxsackie B 4 virus. Significant microscopic changes were seen in the valves in 50 per cent of the infected animals and in the mural endocardium in 48 per cent of the animals. The time sequence and histology of the changes are described, beginning with the earliest changes noted on the 2 nd <b>day</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation.</b> Fibrosis or scarring of the valves and mural endocardium are demonstrated in those animals allowed to survive after the 3 - 5 th weeks of infection...|$|E
40|$|Human fetal {{lymphoid cells}} from the thymus, spleen and {{peripheral}} blood of 25 fetuses (14 - 25 weeks of fetal age) were studied {{for their ability to}} respond to phytohemagglutinin(PHA), pokeweed mitogen(PWM), and streptolysin- 0 (SLO). Lymphocyte transformation by PHA and PWM was observed in the thymus, spleen and peripheral blood at the 14 - 16 th week of fetal age. The percentage of transformed thymic lymphocytes, observed 3 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation,</b> decreased as the age of fetuses increased. On the other hand, splenic lymphocyte transformation increased according to age. The percentage of thymic lymphocytes transformed by PHA, observed 3 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation,</b> was comparable to that of transformed splenic and peripheral blood lymphocytes. However, a lower percentage of transformed lymphocytes in the thymus was observed 6 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation</b> compared to that of transformed splenic lymphocytes. In the thymus, the response to PHA observed 3 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation</b> was higher in ratio than that observed 6 <b>days</b> <b>after.</b> These results suggest that thymic lymphocytes consist of two subpopulations which exhibit "maximum response" 3 or 6 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation.</b> The percentages of thymic lymphocytes and splenic lymphocytes transformed by PWM were the same. In PWM-stimulated transformation, no difference was detectable between these two organs. There was no difference in transformation whether observed 3 or 6 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation</b> with PWM. Lymphocyte transformation to SLO was observed in the thymus at the 17 th week and in the spleen at the 19 th week. Although cord blood lymphocytes were not exposed to streptococcal extracts, they were transformed by SLO. These results suggested that SLO was a nonspecific mitogen. Human fetal lymphoid {{cells from the}} thymus and the spleen of 9 fetuses (14 - 25 weeks) were examined for the presence of spontaneous rosette-forming cells (RFC) with sheep red blood cells. RFC were found in the thymus and spleen at the 14 th week. The average percentage of RFC was 78. 1 % in the thymus and 12. 1 % in the spleen...|$|R
40|$|Two {{kinds of}} assay, {{particle}} counts by electron microscopy and infectivity for leaves ofPhaseolus vulgaris {{were used to}} estimate the amounts of virus in extracts made from tobacco leaves kept at 14 to 34 ° for I to 6 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation,</b> and in extracts from uninoculated tip leaves sampled 14 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> the plants were inoculated. One, 2 and 6 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation,</b> virus isolate PRN was obtained in largest amount from leaves at 22 °, 18 ° and 14 °, respectively. Isolate CAM showed the same trend, but equivalent temperatures were 4 to 6 ° higher.

40|$|Myocardial {{fibrosis}} can {{be produced}} in certain inbred strains of mice after coxsackievirus B subtype 3 (CVB 3) infection. The mechanism responsible for this interstitial matrix alteration is unknown. The presumption is that fibrosis occurs in areas of myocyte damage and inflammation associated with viral infection, analogous to scar formation after cell injury in other organ systems. To test this hypothesis, we examined the hearts of A/J strain mice infected with three CVB 3 variants (Crowell [CVB 3 -CR], Woodruff [CVB 3 -WD], and Lerner [CVB 3 -LR]), each known to cause different degrees of acute myocardial injury. With these three variants, virus was present in the heart until <b>day</b> 28 <b>after</b> <b>inoculation</b> but was absent thereafter. Fourteen <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation,</b> inflammation with myocyte necrosis was seen in discrete foci throughout the myocardium with all three variants. Collapse and disorganization of the usually delicate connective tissue matrix identifiable by silver impregnation was seen in these areas of myocyte injury. Persistent, diffuse lymphocytic infiltration of the myocardium was seen 55 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation</b> with CVB 3 -WD and CVB 3 -LR, but hearts initially infected with CVB 3 -CR showed only rare interstitial lymphocytes comparable to uninfected control hearts. The focal scars produced by myocyte necrosis 14 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation</b> were accentuated and heavily collagenized 55 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation</b> with CVB 3 -WD and CVB 3 -LR; however, these foci were indistinct 55 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation</b> with CVB 3 -CR. Furthermore, the usually delicate network of interstitial collagen fibers surrounding individual myocytes became thickened throughout the heart 55 <b>days</b> <b>after</b> <b>inoculation</b> with CVB 3 -WD and CVB 3 -LR, away from visibly scarred areas produced early after infection with these variants. This diffuse reticulin thickening was not seen after infection with the Crowell variant. Only the virus variants associated with persistent interstitial inflammation at day 55 developed major collagen matrix alterations and interstitial fibrosis. We conclude that this persistent interstitial lymphocytic infiltration reflects altered immune function related to specific virus variants in this animal strain. We postulate that these lymphocytes {{are part of a}} delayed immunopathogenic response uncoupled from the original viral injury and inflammatory damage. Potential mechanisms by which this interstitial lymphocytic infiltration results in fibrosis are discussed...|$|R
