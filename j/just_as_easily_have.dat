Describing Cubic Ninja as [...] "one of those frustrating games {{that is almost}} really cool, but never quite delivers", IGN praised Cubic Ninja for its [...] "fun and creative" [...] gameplay, but the gyroscope controls were criticized for not being sensitive enough, while the circle pad control scheme was considered [...] "wonky". Additionally, Cubic Ninja was panned for not containing enough content to justify being a full-price game, considering it to be [...] "an experience that feels like it <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> could <b>have</b> been a $5 iPhone game".|$|R

My own belief is that Freud {{may have been a}} brilliant thinker, but Freudianism is completely without scientific basis. At least as `scientific' is usually defined." [...] Instead of seeing character as something defined by puberty-related traumas, Hill prefers to see character defined by action - [...] "what a man does," [...] he says, [...] "not what {{may or may not have}} been done to him in some faraway past." [...] In this regard, the core of Johnny Handsome is a [...] " [...] a character-is-destiny story... Maybe more than film noir, it's a tragedy.

[...] Although he remarked that [...] "statisticians will have a field day" [...] with the game's detailed economics, he disliked Tropico 2s lack of direct control over units, and found the overall product [...] "rather limited." [...] Writing for PC Gamer US, Stephen Poole criticized the game's combination of piracy and management gameplay, which he found awkward, unrealistic and unsatisfying. He also argued that the game's musical style is incongruous with its setting. Poole concluded that Tropico 2s theme is [...] "barely a skin-deep covering on a sim that could <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>have</b> been made about the ACME Widget Factory." ...|$|E

2500|$|After O'Bannon {{handed him}} a copy of Giger's book Necronomicon, Scott {{immediately}} saw the potential for Giger's designs, and chose Necronom IV, a print Giger completed in 1976, {{as the basis for}} the Alien's design, citing its beauty and strong sexual overtones. That the creature could <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>have</b> been male or female was also a strong factor in the decision to use it. [...] "It could just as easily fuck you before it killed you," [...] said line producer Ivor Powell, [...] " [...] made it all the more disconcerting." [...] Fox studios were initially wary of allowing Giger onto the project, saying that his works would be too disturbing for audiences, but eventually relented. Giger initially offered to completely design the Alien from scratch, but Scott mandated that he base his work on Necronom IV, saying that to start over from the beginning would be too time-consuming. Giger signed on to design the adult, egg and chest-burster forms, but ultimately also designed the alien planetoid LV-426 and the Space Jockey alien vessel.|$|E
5000|$|In this chapter, Unger {{addresses}} two plausible {{objections to}} the program of critical legal studies, and offers his response to them. The objections are, in turn, that it seems merely an accident that {{we find ourselves in}} a situation in which we are engaged in the [...] "internal development" [...] of a program such as the one Unger describes, and thus such a program would seem to have no intrinsic authority, since <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> we could <b>have</b> found ourselves developing a program that leads in another direction. The second plausible objection is that any tradition is inherently ambiguous, and equally compelling arguments could be made for developing the tradition of leftist movements in some other direction.|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked how}} much Larrikin would be seeking in damages, Larrikin's lawyer Adam Simpson replied: [...] "anything from what we've claimed, which is between 40 and 60 per cent, and what they suggest, which is {{considerably}} less." [...] In court, Lurie claimed that, had the parties negotiated a licence at the outset as willing parties, the royalties would have been between 25 and 50 per cent. Lurie defended the court action, stating: [...] "Of course it would be disingenuous {{for me to say}} that there wasn’t a financial aspect involved, but you could <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> say what <b>has</b> won out today is the importance of checking before using other people’s copyrights."

As long as we had the molding, all went well; but if they {{fall into the hands}} of {{designing}} men they can be led in another direction <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>as</b> we <b>have</b> led them in ours. I own that I don't see who can be sufficiently interested in the matter to conceive and carry out a great conspiracy of this kind. The King of Oude is a captive in our hands, the King of Delhi is too old to play such a part. Scindia and Holkar may possibly long for the powers their fathers possessed, but they are not likely to act together, and may be regarded as rivals rather than friends, and yet if it is not one of these who has been brewing this storm. I own I don't see who can be at the bottom of it, unless it has really originated from some ambitious spirits among the Sepoys, who look in the event of success to being masters of the destinies of India. It is a pity we did not get a few more views from that juggler; we might have known a little more of it then." ...|$|R

6000|$|Herbert coughed drily. 'Then {{there are}} two of them for me to contend against,' {{he said to himself}} with an inward smile. 'I should really hardly have {{expected}} that, now. One would have said a priori that the sound common-sense and practical regard for the dominant feelings of society, which is so justly strong in most women, would have kept HER at any rate--with her own social disabilities, too--from aiding and abetting her husband in such a piece of egregious folly'--'I'm sorry to hear it, Mrs. Le Breton,' he went on aloud,--he never called her by her Christian name, and Edie was somehow rather pleased that he didn't: 'for you know Herr Schurz is far from being a desirable acquaintance. Quite apart from his own personal worth, of course--which is a question that I for my part am not called upon to decide--he's a snare and a stumbling-block in the eyes of society, and very likely indeed to injure Ernest's future prospects, as he has certainly injured his career in the past. You know he's going to be tried in a few weeks for a seditious libel and for inciting to murder the Emperor of Russia. Now, you will yourself admit, Mrs. Le Breton, that it's an awkward thing to be mixed up with people who are tried on a criminal charge for inciting to murder. Of course, we all allow that the Czar's a very despotic and autocratic sovereign, that his existence is an anomaly, and that the desire to blow him up is a very natural desire for every intelligent Russian to harbour privately in the solitude of his own bosom. If we were Russians ourselves, no doubt we'd try to blow him up too, if we could conveniently do so without detection. So much, every rational Englishman, who isn't blinded by prejudice or frightened by the mere sound of words, must at once frankly acknowledge. But unfortunately, you see, the mass of Englishmen ARE blinded by prejudice, and ARE frightened by the mere sound of words. To them, blowing up a Czar is murder (though of course blowing up any number of our own black people isn't); and inciting to blow up the Czar, or doing what seems to most Englishmen equivalent to such incitement, as for example, saying in print that the Czar's government isn't quite ideally perfect and ought gradually and tentatively to be abolished--why, that, I say, is a criminal offence, and is naturally punishable by a term of imprisonment. Now, is it worth while to mix oneself up with people like that, Ernest, when you can <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> do without <b>having</b> anything on earth to say to them?' ...|$|R

When they took sick, even with trifling afflictions that any ordinary man could pull through, they just pegged out. Sometimes they were found unattended and dead in their beds; on occasion their bodies were dragged out of the water; and sometimes it was just plain accident, as when Bill Kelley, unloading cargo while drunk, had a finger jerked off, which, under the circumstances, might <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>have</b> been his head.|$|E

In this case, said he, before they have entered upon service, or got the least smattering of duty, they will claim a discharge; if they are pursuing an enemy who has committed the most unheard-of cruelties, he has only to step across the Potomac and he is safe.

6000|$|... 7. Look, then, to {{the branch}} you hold in your hand. That you can so hold it, {{or make a}} crown of it, if you choose, {{is the first thing}} I want you to note of it;--the {{proportion}} of size, namely, between the leaf and you. Great part of your life and character, as a human creature, has depended on that. Suppose all leaves had been spacious, like some palm leaves; solid, like cactus stem; or that trees had grown, as they might of course <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>have</b> grown, like mushrooms, all one great cluster of leaf round one stalk. I do not say that they are divided into small leaves only for your delight, or your service, as if you were the monarch of everything--even in this atom of a globe. You are made of your proper size; and the leaves of theirs: for reasons, and by laws, of which neither the leaves nor you know anything. Only note the harmony between both, and the joy we may have in this division and mystery of the frivolous and tremulous petals, {44} which break the light and the breeze,--compared to what with the frivolous and tremulous mind which is in us, we could have had out of domes, or penthouses, or walls of leaf.|$|E
60|$|We {{went to one}} of {{the mines}} which are still worked, and boys came running to meet us with {{specimens}} of the copper ore for sale. The miners were not now hoisting ore from the shaft, but were washing and selecting the valuable fragments from great heaps of crumbled stone and earth. All about this spot there are shafts and well-holes, looking fearfully deep and black, and without the slightest protection, so that we might <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> <b>have</b> walked into them as not. Having examined these matters sufficiently, we descended the hill towards the village, meeting parties of visitors, mounted on donkeys, which is a much more sensible way of ascending in a hot day than to walk. On the sides and summit of the hill we found yellow gorse,--heath of two colors, I think, and very beautiful,--and here and there a harebell. Owing to the long-continued dry weather, the grass was getting withered and brown, though not so much so as on American hill-pastures at this season. Returning to the village, we all went into a confectioner's shop, and made a good luncheon. The two prettiest young ladies whom I have seen in England came into the shop and ate cakes while we were there. They appeared to be living together in a lodging-house, and ordered some of their housekeeping articles from the confectioner.|$|E
