40|$|Multi-axial aramid fabrics have a {{wide range}} of {{applications}} in the construction of composite structures for body armor. Nanoparticles, which include nanosilica, {{are one of the most}} common nanofillers for these structures. The particles of nanosilica possess nanometer dimensions with high specific surface area. Silane coupling agents are mostly used for modifying nanosilica surface in order to prevent silica agglomeration. Incorporation of nanosilica treated <b>with</b> <b>silane</b> adhesion promoter, in the matrix part of the hybrid composite form, leads to increased resistance to the bullet shock impact. In this study, the resistance to penetration of a shot bullet was tested for four samples of the aramid fabric composite forms. All fabrics were coated with γ-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (AMEO silane) /ethanol solution. Two samples were <b>impregnated</b> <b>with</b> poly (vinyl butyral) (PVB) /ethanol solution, while the other two were <b>impregnated</b> <b>with</b> the same solution, but with the addition of the 30 wt. % AMEO silane modified silica nanoparticles as reinforcement. The samples were both hard and flexible options. The bullet-shooting test was applied to all the composites by two different bullet types. The structural design of the samples improved the ballistic resistance after the bullets were shot. Some ballistic image analyses for print and penetration depth of the samples were performed using Image Pro-Plus software...|$|R

40|$|The water {{repellency}} and chloride resistance of modified concrete <b>with</b> <b>silane</b> without and <b>with</b> cracks {{have been investigated}} through neutron radiography test, water absorption test and chloride penetration test. The {{results indicate that the}} process of water penetration into mortar specimens without silane can be visualized distinctly by means of neutron radiography, while water in the modified mortar <b>with</b> <b>silane</b> cannot be observed by naked eyes. The hydrophobic films formed in the capillary pores from the added silane effectively restrain liquid water from penetrating into mortar, and consequently it results in decreasing water absorption to be only 13 % of mortar without silane. The hydrolysis and polymerization reaction of silane in cementitious materials do not block the respirability of the capillary pores. Cracks are instantaneously filled with water once specimens without silane crack, and after that water will penetrate into the adjacent areas around the cracks. However, even when the modified specimens <b>with</b> <b>silane</b> crack up to 0. 3 mm, there is no obvious water movement observed. The cracks from 0. 1 mm to 0. 4 mm hardly decrease the integral {{water repellency}} of modified concrete <b>with</b> <b>silane.</b> Due to the high water repellency of the modified concrete <b>with</b> <b>silane</b> it thus also has high resistance to chloride penetration with or without cracks.

When tested against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, gendine-coated CVC segments provided protection against bacterial adherence significantly more than all other types of tested CVCs (P < 0. 05). Gendine-coated CVCs also provided better protection against Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis than CVCs <b>impregnated</b> <b>with</b> antibiotics or with silver, platinum, and carbon (P < 0. 02).

We compared the rates of catheter colonization and catheter-related bloodstream infection associated with these two kinds of antiinfective catheters. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized clinical trial in 12 university-affiliated hospitals. High-risk adult patients in whom central venous catheters were expected to remain in place for three or more days were randomly assigned to undergo insertion of polyurethane, triple-lumen catheters <b>impregnated</b> <b>with</b> either minocycline and rifampin (on both the luminal and external surfaces) or chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine (on only the external surface). After their removal, the tips and subcutaneous segments of the catheters were cultured by both the roll-plate and the sonication methods. Peripheral-blood cultures were obtained if clinically indicated. RESULTS: Of 865 catheters inserted, 738 (85 percent) produced culture results that could be evaluated. The clinical characteristics of the patients and the risk factors for infection were similar in the two groups. Catheters <b>impregnated</b> <b>with</b> minocycline and rifampin were 1 / 3 as likely to be colonized as catheters <b>impregnated</b> <b>with</b> chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine (28 of 356 catheters [7. 9 percent] vs. 87 of 382 [22. 8 percent], P CONCLUSIONS: The use of central venous catheters <b>impregnated</b> <b>with</b> minocycline and rifampin is associated with a lower rate of infection than the use of catheters <b>impregnated</b> <b>with</b> chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine...|$|R

We confirmed that CGSs <b>impregnated</b> <b>with</b> a bFGF concentration of up to 50 µg/cm(2) were able to sustain the release of bFGF throughout their biodegradation. We prepared decubitus ulcers on diabetic mice. After debriding the ulcers, we implanted CGSs (diameter 8 mm) <b>impregnated</b> <b>with</b> normal saline solution (NSS) or bFGF solution (7, 14, 28 or 50 µg/cm(2)). At 1 and 2 weeks after implantation, the mice were sacrificed and tissue specimens were obtained.

The CGSs <b>impregnated</b> <b>with</b> NSS became infected and degraded, whereas the CGSs <b>impregnated</b> <b>with</b> 7 or 14 µg/cm(2) bFGF displayed accelerated dermis-like tissue formation and the CGSs <b>impregnated</b> <b>with</b> 14 µg/cm(2) bFGF produced significant improvements in the remaining wound area, neoepithelium length and numbers and total area of newly formed capillaries compared with the NSS group.
