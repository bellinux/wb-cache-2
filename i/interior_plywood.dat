5000|$|The Olson 30 was {{introduced}} into a crowded market of ultralight boats {{constructed in the}} Santa Cruz area, including Ron Moore's Moore 24 and Bill Lee's Santa Cruz 27. The Olson 30 featured a single spreader masthead sloop rig with aluminum spars from either Sparcraft Spars or Ballenger Spars of Santa Cruz. Unlike the Moore 24 and Santa Cruz 27, the Olson 30 was relatively beamier and was not legally trailerable without a special permit in California (although it's unclear whether any of the owners actually sought out permits). Construction {{was similar to the}} other Santa Cruz boats with polyester resin, E-glass, and an end-grain balsa core in the hull and deck. The keel was cast lead with a small [...] "stubby" [...] of fiberglass, and the rudder was a fiberglass and foam sandwich with a pultruded fiberglass shaft. Unlike many of the boats built in Santa Cruz, the Olson 30 had a light spruce <b>plywood</b> <b>interior,</b> in contrast to the more common Bruynzeel <b>plywood</b> <b>interiors</b> of other boats.|$|R

40|$|Particleboard {{is widely}} used for making bookshelf, furniture, {{cabinets}} and many other interior products. At present, particleboard is mainly produced with wood particles and urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins. The emission of carcinogenic formaldehyde in the production and use of particleboard has generated an urgent need for development of a formaldehyde-free wood adhesive for making particleboard. Formaldehyde is derived from natural gas whose reserve is finite. It is also desirable to develop a wood adhesive from renewable material for making particleboard. Soy flour is inexpensive, abundant, renewable and readily available.

Askin had been a [...] "vocal critic of the project prior to gaining office."His new Minister for Public Works, Davis Hughes, was even less sympathetic. Elizabeth Farrelly, Australian architecture critic, has written that: at an election night dinner party in Mosman, Hughes' daughter Sue Burgoyne boasted that her father would soon sack Utzon.

40|$|Filler {{is added}} to {{adhesive}} formulations to reduce resin utilization leading to cost savings. Melamine urea formaldehyde (MUF) resin has been synthesized in the laboratory. The palm kernel meal (PKM) and palm shell (PS) are used as fillers to formulate the melamine urea formaldehyde (MUF) resin based adhesive for <b>interior</b> <b>plywood</b> manufacturing. These formulations are compared with commercialized industry wheat flour (IF) filler. Response surface methodology (RSM) is used for identification of the optimum temperature and pressing time for wood adhesive performance. The experiments have been conducted in the temperature range from 100 to 150 °C and pressing time from 50 s to 250 s. The result indicates {{that the effect of}} the filler type on plywood shear strength and formaldehyde emission is significant. The optimum shear strength and formaldehyde emission performance of PKM, IF and PS are 1. 41 MPa, 1. 30 MPa, 1. 21 MPa and 0. 9988 mg/L, 0. 5345 mg/L, 1. 2735 mg/L respectively. In addition, the optimum hot press temperature and time of PKM, IF and PS are 124. 9 °C, 130. 9 °C, 127. 9 °C and 156 s, 153 s, 149 s respectively.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Synthetic adhesives, such as phenol-formaldehyde (PF) resins and {{urea-formaldehyde}} (UF) resins, {{have dominated}} the wood adhesive market since they were introduced in the wood products industry. Formaldehyde, as a key component in the manufacturing of PF and UF resins, has been classified as a known human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The UF and PF resins are derived from petroleum and natural gas. However, petroleum resources are not infinite and not renewable. In recent years, with concerns over fluctuating prices and future-exhaustion of oil, as well environmental issues of the UF resins, soy-based adhesives have again drawn people’s attention {{as one of the}} most promising alternatives to petroleum-based adhesives. A soy-based adhesive, consisting of soy flour (SF) and a curing agent (CA) (polyamidoamine-epichlorohydrin (PAE) resin) has been commercialized for production of plywood since 2004. The PAE resin is derived from petrochemicals and is the most expensive component of the soy-based adhesive. In this study, a new formaldehyde-free adhesive, consisting of soy flour (SF) and a new curing agent (CA), was developed and evaluated for making <b>interior</b> <b>plywood.</b> The CA was developed from the reaction of epichlorohydrin (ECH) and ammonium hydroxide in water.

40|$|Fillers {{are added}} in {{adhesive}} formulation {{to minimize the}} utilization of resin in wood based products. Waste Rubber Powder is being used as wood adhesive filler in order to change the research work from waste to wealth. In this work, Melamine Urea Formaldehyde (MUF) resin was produced in the laboratory and waste rubber powder was subjected to chemical modification by using oxidizing agents such as 20 % nitric acid, 30 % hydrogen peroxide and acetone solution {{were added to the}} Melamine Urea Formaldehyde (MUF) resin in identifying the best chemically modified waste rubber powder for <b>interior</b> <b>plywood</b> manufacturing using a laboratory press. Most of the plywood adhesives are formaldehyde based, which are not environmental friendly due to the formaldehyde emission, formaldehyde is considered as a carcinogenic agent. Due to the formaldehyde emission issue, plywood export to Europe and United State had been decreased. Therefore, the formaldehyde emission from the plywood is reduced. This work demonstrates the effect of filler at shear strength, water resistant and formaldehyde performance. Response surface methodology (RSM) software was used for identification of the optimum temperature and pressing time for wood adhesive performance. The optimum parameters investigated in this experiment was in the temperature range from 100 to 175 °C at fixed pressing time at 150 sec while in the time range from 50 to 450 s at fixed prssing temperature at 125 ˚C. It was found that chemically modified waste rubber powder with 20 % nitric acid had better plywood shear strenght, water resistant and formaldehyde emmision performance compared with other oxidizing agents solution. The optimum shear strength and formaldehyde emission performance of WRP was obtained by using pressing temperature 171. 60 ˚C and time 269. 27 s was 1. 37 MPa and 0. 7315 mg/L. This work proved that extender is an important in enhancing the wood performance for wood adhesive. The sufficient amount of filler will increase the shear strength and decrease the formaldehyde emission of wood adhesive...|$|E

However, this CA-soy adhesive has high viscosity and is difficult to be sprayed onto wood particles with a conventional spraying nozzle. This study developed a new method of using this CA-soy adhesive for making particleboard. This new method involved the coating of wood particles with a dilute soy slurry in water, the drying of the soy-coated wood particles, the spraying of the CA onto the dried soy-coated wood particles, the formation of a particleboard mat with the CA-soy-coated wood particles and the hotpressing of the mat into particleboard. The high viscosity of the adhesive was no longer an issue with this new method. For investigation of the effectiveness of this new method, effects of particleboard density, adhesive usages for both core and face particles, the solids content of the soy slurry, hot-press time, hot-press temperature, the storage time of the soy-coated wood particles, and the soy/CA ratio on the internal bond strength (IB), the modulus of rupture (MOR), and the modulus of elasticity (MOE) of the resulting particleboard were investigated in detail. Results demonstrated that this new method had wide operational windows for making particleboard and allowed the strengths of particleboard bonded with this CA-soy adhesive to exceed the industry requirements of M- 2 particleboard. The optimal conditions of using this method for making particleboard in terms of enhancing the IB, MOR, and MOE were: 760 kg/m³ of the particleboard density, 11 wt...|$|E
