In [...] "Pac-Man Fever", the April 24, 2013 episode of the American TV series Supernatural, the character Charlie Bradbury (played by Felicia Day) is seen wearing a Lying Cat T-shirt.

500|$|Maeda {{focused on}} making jokes an {{important}} part of Angel Beats!, leading Toba to seek out Seiji Kishi to be the director, because of his experience in directing and his pulling power influence on the staff of P.A.Works, where there are many that are still young. Kishi was ultimately approached by P.A.Works representative director Kenji Horikawa about working on a [...] "school comedy written by a game scenario writer" [...] and was shocked after taking the director's position to discover Maeda was the screenwriter. Kishi commented how, far from <b>just</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> comedy, the series contains many different aspects, including flashy action scenes, live musical performances, and drama. Kishi stated that normally he would be hard pressed to cover this range of aspects, but was motivated by Maeda's uncompromising attitude in regards to the script. The decision to add in the all female band Girls Dead Monster was due to Maeda's intent to add in many different and interesting elements into the series.|$|E

500|$|Initial {{reviews for}} Night Trap on the Sega CD were mixed. The title is notable {{for being the}} first {{interactive}} movie on the system and was thus seen as breaking new ground {{in terms of both}} genre and technology. Critics were quick to point out the game's [...] qualities that were reminiscent of teen horror movies. The staff at Sega Force felt that playing the game was like [...] "directing your own B movie. Night Trap makes you feel part of the game." [...] Along with feeling like a B movie, critics identified the [...] "warped" [...] and [...] "tacky" [...] sense of humor as helping the game's appeal and adding to its charm. From a technological perspective, the video quality was praised for being high-quality and smooth, although the Sega CD's low color capabilities were identified as a weakness. The most common point of complaint was the gameplay. Some critics cited it for being boring and shallow because it mostly involved pressing one button at the right time to trap the enemies. The staff at Computer and Video Games felt Night Trap was reminiscent of Dragon's Lair (1983) and Space Ace (1984) and shared the same issues those games had with gameplay <b>just</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> matter of hitting buttons in the right moments.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} by the same internal Square Enix team that made , which was also initially a game for Japanese cell phones. The game was directed by Toshio Akiyama and produced by Takashi Tokita. [...] Character designs were provided by Akira Oguro while the in-game 2D dot versions were created by Kazuko Shibuya. Takashi Tokita explained the game was meant to transcend the expectations of RPGs in cellphones. The team set the theme of a scenario of creating another game for the SNES. The team also added several references to previous games such as Sarah and Matoya being references to the original Final Fantasy game and Dusk and Alba being reminiscent of Palom and Porom from Final Fantasy IV. When asked about the high pricing for the game, the team explained their reasons stating, [...] "This title offers about 50 hours of gameplay, and we feel that our community can enjoy the contents of this game as much as they would a console title. Also, we have set the price where it is because this title was developed specifically for the mobile platform, as opposed to <b>just</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> port of an older console or handheld game." [...] When developing the smartphone version, Takashi Tokita changed the structure of selling a group of episodes rather than individually.|$|E
500|$|Christian {{religious}} devotion had {{historically been}} accompanied by rejection of mundane affairs, including economic pursuit. Weber showed that certain types of Protestantism– notably Calvinism– were supportive of rational pursuit of economic gain and worldly activities dedicated to it, seeing them as endowed with moral and spiritual significance. Weber argued {{that there were many}} reasons to look for the origins of modern capitalism in the religious ideas of the Reformation. In particular, the Protestant ethic (or more specifically, Calvinist ethic) motivated the believers to work hard, be successful in business and reinvest their profits in further development rather than frivolous pleasures. The notion of calling meant that each individual had to take action as an indication of their salvation; <b>just</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> member of the Church was not enough. Predestination also reduced agonising over economic inequality and further, it meant that a material wealth could be taken as a sign of salvation in the afterlife. The believers thus justified pursuit of profit with religion, as instead of being fuelled by morally suspect greed or ambition, their actions were motivated by a highly moral and respected philosophy. This Weber called the [...] "spirit of capitalism": it was the Protestant religious ideology that was behind– and inevitably led to– the capitalist economic system. This theory is often viewed as a reversal of Marx's thesis that the economic [...] "base" [...] of society determines all other aspects of it.|$|E

The record was designed to reflect a playful, honest and open-minded attitude toward listening to music. Bangalter compared it to the state of childhood when one does not judge or analyze music. Bangalter noted the stylistic approach of the album was in contrast to that of their previous effort. [...] "Homework [...] was a way to say to the rock kids, like, 'Electronic music is cool'. Discovery was the opposite, of saying to the electronic kids, 'Rock is cool, you know? You can like that.'"

To be a successful milliner required [...] not <b>just</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> skilled crafts-person, but a sense of style and a head for business. [...] Eleanor Mosley's own life and career serve as a case in point as to the respectability of the trade.
