This due to the difference in interfacial reaction and intermetallic compound formation on solder pad was strongly influence by the type of surface finishes.

Thus, this study aims to investigate the effect of deposition time of immersion gold coating on wettability of the surface finish and how it affect the formation of intermetallic compounds on solder joint. In this works, deposition time of copper pads in immersion gold solution were varied from 3 minutes up to 15 minutes.

Three different plating techniques were used to deposit the Au layers: electrolytic plating, <b>immersion</b> <b>plating,</b> and <b>immersion</b> <b>plating</b> followed by electrolytic plating. Wide ranges of wire bond force, bond power, and bond-pad temperature were used to identify {{the combination of these}} processing parameters that can produce good wire bonds, allowing the construction of process windows. The criterion for successful bonds is no peel off for all 20 wires tested. The wire pull strengths and wire deformation ratios are measured to evaluate the bond quality, after a successful wire bond. Elemental and surface characterization techniques were used to evaluate the bond-pad surfaces and are correlated to wire bondability and wire pull strength. Based on the process windows along with the pull strength data, the bond-pad metallization and bonding conditions can be further optimized for improved wire bondability and product yields. The wire bondability of the electrolytic bond pad increased with Au-layer thickness. The bond pad with an Au-layer thickness of 0. 7 mum displayed the highest bondability for all bonding conditions used. The bondability of immersion bond pads was comparable to electrolytic bond pads with a similar Au thickness.

40|$|Gel {{residues}} {{occur as}} the result of repeated anti-icing fluid application that leaves a powdery film upon dryout that, when rehydrated, can swell up to over 600 times its weight. When these gels collect on aircraft flight control surfaces in aerodynamically quiet areas and freeze, they give rise to reduced performance, increased stick force, slowed rotation and have caused jammed flight controls. Laboratory tests have been developed to simulate the gel formation by drying out fluids and rehydrating them. However, by their complex nature, much variation is seen between test results from different laboratories and the results are not yet considered by fluid users. Testing carried out at AMIL on different fluids with different test methods has led to a more reproducible results and a potential classification of fluids based on their gel formation potential (GFP). It was found that complete dryout of the fluid, steady <b>immersion,</b> <b>plate</b> etching, wait times, oven temperature, and number of fluid immersions are important factors to the reproducibility of the test method. While, bubbles in the test sample, fluid dilutions, fluid viscosity and weight of the dryout residues had little effect on the tests results. From this study, a classification of the fluids into three categories is proposed: (1) high GFP, (2) high GFP that rinses off and (3) low GFP.

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{the contribution of}} descending fibers from the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) to nociception, and to opioid and non-opioid analgesia in rats. Inactivation of descending fibers was induced by microinjection of the GAGA-A agonist muscimol in the RVM, and nociception was evaluated using the tail <b>immersion,</b> hot <b>plate</b> and formalin tests. In all three tests, microinjection of muscimol (6. 25 [...] 400 ng) in the RVM increased nociceptive responses of animals, suggesting that descending fibers tonically inhibit dorsal horn neurons of the spinal cord. In the formalin test, microinjection of muscimol (50 ng) in the RVM reduced {{the slope of the}} formalin concentration-response relation, so that responses were increased at low, but not at high concentrations of formalin. Conversely, microinjection of the GABA-A antagonist bicuculline in the RVM decreased the slope of the formalin concentration-response relation, so that responses were decreased at high but not at low concentrations of formalin. Microinjection of muscimol in the RVM abolished analgesia induced by systemic morphine in the tail <b>immersion</b> and hot <b>plate</b> tests, but only decreased analgesia by 60 % in the formalin test. Microinjection of muscimol (50 ng) in the RVM abolished morphine analgesia elicited intracerebroventricularly, suggesting that the supraspinal effects of morphine are mediated via descending fibers from the RVM. Peripheral effects may account for the residual analgesic effect of systemic morphine after inactivation of descending fibers in the formalin test. Microinjection of muscimol (50 ng) in the RVM abolished buprenorphine analgesia in all tests. The dopamine uptake inhibitor nomifensine was devoid of analgesic activity in the tail <b>immersion</b> and hot <b>plate</b> tests.

By nowadays, several reports have described immersion deposition of gold [33], copper [34], and silver [35 – 40] on PS at different conditions to form SERS-active substrates.
