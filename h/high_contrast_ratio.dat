50|$|On February 2, 2000, Philippe Binant, {{technical}} manager of Digital Cinema Project at Gaumont in France, realized the first digital cinema projection in Europe with the DLP CINEMA technology developed by Texas Instruments.

50|$|The Samsung Focus {{features}} a Corning Gorilla glass, Super AMOLED display like its Galaxy S cousins. The display is much brighter than LCDs and reduces power consumption.

50|$|The {{desirable}} {{traits of}} fluorophores used for these methods, {{in order to}} maximize the resolution, are that they should be bright. That is, they should have a high extinction coefficient and a high quantum yield. They should also possess a <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>ratio</b> (ratio between the number of photons emitted in the light state and the number of photons emitted in the dark state).

50|$|Fluorescent lamps using {{conventional}} magnetic ballasts flicker {{at twice}} the supply frequency. Electronic ballasts do not produce light flicker since the phosphor persistence is longer than a half cycle of the higher operation frequency of 20 kHz. The 100-120 Hz flicker produced by magnetic ballasts is associated with headaches and eyestrain.Individuals with high critical flicker fusion threshold are particularly affected by light from fluorescent fixtures that have magnetic ballasts: their EEG alpha waves are markedly attenuated and they perform office tasks with greater speed and decreased accuracy. The problems are not observed with electronic ballasts. Ordinary people have better reading performance using high-frequency (20-60 kHz) electronic ballasts than magnetic ballasts, although the effect was small except at <b>high</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|E

Introduction Bistable twisted nematic (BTN) liquid crystal displays (LCD) {{that could be}} switched between two metastable twist states using an electrical pulse was discovered by Berreman et al in 1981 1. A 0 to 2 p bistability was demonstrated in that paper. Recently, Tanaka et al 2 developed a driving method for passivematrix addressing of such BTN displays. This high performance LCD rekindled much interest in BTN LCD 3 - 12. Because of its bistability, the BTN LCD can be driven with the behaviour of an active matrix display, without any cross talk problems associated with passive multiplexing. Another advantage of BTN is that since both bistable twist [...] ...|$|R
