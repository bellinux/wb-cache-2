25|$|Chewing insects {{have two}} mandibles, {{one on each}} side of the head. The mandibles are {{positioned}} between the labrum and maxillae. The mandibles cut and crush food, and may be used for defense; generally, they have an apical cutting edge, and the more basal molar area grinds the food. They can be extremely hard (around 3 on Mohs, or an <b>indentation</b> <b>hardness</b> of about 30kg/mm2); thus, many termites and beetles have no physical difficulty in boring through foils made from such common metals as copper, lead, tin, and zinc. The cutting edges are typically strengthened by the addition of zinc, manganese, or rarely, iron, in amounts up to about 4% of the dry weight. They are typically the largest mouthparts of chewing insects, being used to masticate (cut, tear, crush, chew) food items. They open outwards (to the sides of the head) and come together medially. In carnivorous, chewing insects, the mandibles can be modified to be more knife-like, whereas in herbivorous chewing insects, they are more typically broad and flat on their opposing faces (e.g., caterpillars). In male stag beetles, the mandibles are modified to such an extent as to not serve any feeding function, but are instead are used to defend mating sites from other males. In ants, the mandibles also serve a defensive function (particularly in soldier castes). In bull ants, the mandibles are elongated and toothed, used as hunting (and defensive) appendages.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} nanoindentation {{technique}} based on {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM) that allows one to deduce both <b>indentation</b> modulus and <b>hardness</b> of viscoelastic materials from the force versus penetration depth dependence, obtained by recording the AFM cantilever deflection {{as a function of}} the sample vertical displacement when the tip is pressed against (loading phase) and then removed from (unloading phase) the surface of the sample. Reliable quantitative measurements of both <b>indentation</b> modulus and <b>hardness</b> of the investigated sample are obtained by calibrating the technique through a set of different polymeric samples, used as reference materials, whose mechanical properties have been previously determined by standard indentation tests. By analyzing the dependence of the cantilever deflection versus time, the proposed technique allows one to evaluate and correct the effect of viscoelastic properties of the investigated materials, by adapting a post-experiment data processing procedure well-established for standard depth sensing indentation tests.

In this paper, how structure-sensitive {{parameters}} {{derived from}} the hysteresis loop, like coercive field, remanent induction, and hysteresis losses, {{can be used to}} characterise recovery and recrystallization in cold rolled Ti-Nb stabilised interstitial free ultra low carbon steel is shown. The effect on hysteresis measurements of isothermal annealing treatments applied to industrially cold rolled samples at different temperatures is related to the microstructural changes which take place during the annealing {{as a consequence of the}} metallurgical recovery and recrystallization processes. It has been observed that the remanent magnetic field, the coercive field and the hysteresis losses can be used to monitor recovery. Furthermore, recrystallization can be characterised by coercive field and hysteresis loss measurements.
