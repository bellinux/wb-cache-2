40|$|The Italian ‘Internal Stability Pact’ (ISP) {{has been}} {{introduced}} in 1999 in order to involve and enhance responsiveness of local governments towards the European ‘Stability and Growth Pact’ (1997) and its constraints. Since then the <b>Italian</b> <b>Pact</b> has been progressively reinforced and tightened up. This article aims to analyze {{the effects of the}} formal respect of the ISP through the lens of Italian Business Economics and its fundamental principles. It is based on the examination of the existing literature, and especially on the analysis of the official financial statements (2002 - 2006) of a representative sample of Italian municipalities. This investigation confirms that the compliance to the ISP caused some relevant consequences on Italian Municipalities: {{not only in terms of}} preferences and policies concerning accounting, debt, investments and expenses, but also on choices concerning internal and external management and local governance. It encourages the adoption of initiatives aiming to reduce public expenses and waste and to enhance the efficiency, effectiveness and economy in Municipalities’ management and in public services’ offer; but similarly it seems to induce a general embitterment the underlying institutional hostility between local and national governments, and the adoption of some opportunistic or ‘risky’ decisions. Furthermore this control system tends to accentuate, and sometimes to stimulate, Municipalities’ inclination to focus management decisions to the short term, despite their sustainability and inter-generational equity, and it exacerbates general difficulties in long-term planning and in the management of extraordinary events. Finally ISP seems to generate a critical trade-off between: the control of public expenses and deficit, the enhancement of the Italian Municipalities’ autonomy after devolution and Constitutional reforms, and finally the improvement of the efficiency and the effectiveness in internal and external management and in the local governance...|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the role played}} by trade unions within <b>Italian</b> territorial <b>pacts</b> (TPs). Trade unions have always played a part in the negotiations that establish TPs, but their role has been rather underplayed in the wider literature. Based on comparative empirical research into the eight territorial pacts signed in the Province of Turin, in the north-west of Italy, it was found that union participation in the TPs was shaped by the type of TP, the size of union organizations, and the personal commitment of individual union representatives. It was found that the patterns of union participation in TPs reflected the long-standing Italian tradition of micro-concertation, but the outcomes did not...|$|R
40|$|In the new EU member states, {{tripartite}} national-level social pacts {{have been}} promoted as a preferred and effective instrument for a rapid and relatively painless fulfilment of the Maastricht criteria, following {{the example of}} many of the old member states in the 1990 s, and notably Italy. But such policy advice is not based on careful comparisons. By comparing Poland and Italy, this article undermines the dominant view that the failure of concertation attempts in Poland is mostly due to trade union politicization. The comparative test with Italy, a country with equally politicized trade unions, and where, by contrast, important social pacts have been signed, suggests that divergent employer strategies and organization are at least an equally important factor. Additionally, the study provides a more mixed assessment of the <b>Italian</b> social <b>pacts...</b>|$|R
25|$|With {{nationalist}} sentiment {{firmly on}} the side of reclaiming Italian territories of Austria-Hungary, Italy entered negotiations with the Triple Entente. The negotiations ended successfully in April 1915 when the London Pact was brokered with the <b>Italian</b> government. The <b>pact</b> ensured Italy the right to attain all Italian-populated lands it wanted from Austria-Hungary, as well as concessions in the Balkan Peninsula and suitable compensation for any territory gained by the United Kingdom and France from Germany in Africa. The proposal fulfilled the desires of Italian nationalists and Italian imperialism and was agreed to. Italy joined the Triple Entente in its war against Austria-Hungary.|$|R

The available domestic financial tools are here shortly revised, particularly about their compatibility with the Stability Pact. The role of the socalled rotative founds is moreover described {{as a tool for}} supporting Public Administrations in improving their energy efficiency, even in the observance of the limits established by the Stability Pact...|$|R

40|$|While the Central Government is {{responsible}} for the European Stability and Growth Pact, internal coordination among different layers of government is crucial to comply with the European obligation. In this paper the <b>Italian</b> Domestic Stability <b>Pact</b> (DSP) on local authorities is evaluated in terms of its effects on the public sector borrowing requirement from 1999 to 2005. A new data base is used to verify yearly and for each local authority the respect of the Italian DSP. More precisely, the fiscal rule is calculated on official budget data for the whole sample of local authorities tied. The results supply evidence for reconsidering the structure of the DSP in terms of binding fiscal rule, adjustment of structural local budget deficits and international compliance. ...|$|R
40|$|The 1999 - 2006 {{versions}} of the <b>Italian</b> Domestic Stability <b>Pact</b> showed many pitfalls and a modest impact {{with respect to the}} aim of aligning the fiscal behaviour of the sub-central governments with the national commitments within the European Stability and Growth Pact. The Domestic Pact has been reformed in 2007 and 2008 to tighten the monitoring and sanctions framework and to avoid some unpleasant results in the budget composition. However, some unpleasant features spoil the new regime: its budgetary rules are relatively complicated, they rely exclusively on historical data and do not provide for an adequate set of incentives to promote allocative efficiency; no borrowing constraints are applied; side effects on resource redistribution are ignored. The assessment of the new Domestic Pact against the data on the sub-central governments of a Centre Italy region (Lazio) confirms the above findings...|$|R
5000|$|As {{early as}} September 1938, the Italian {{military}} had drawn up plans to invade Albania. On 7 April, Italian forces {{landed in the}} country and within three days had occupied the majority of the country. Albania represented a territory Italy could acquire for [...] "'living space' to ease its overpopulation" [...] as well as the foothold needed to launch other expansionist conflicts in the Balkans. On 22 May 1939, Italy and Germany signed the Pact of Steel joining both countries in a military alliance. The pact was the culmination of German-Italian relations from 1936 and was not defensive in nature. Rather, the pact was designed for a [...] "joint war against France and Britain", although the Italian hierarchy held the understanding that such a war would not take place for several years. However, despite the <b>Italian</b> impression, the <b>pact</b> made no reference to such a period of peace and the Germans proceeded with their plans to invade Poland.|$|R
40|$|The 1999 - 2006 {{versions}} of the <b>Italian</b> Domestic Stability <b>Pact</b> had many shortcomings and a modest impact {{with respect to the}} aim of aligning the fiscal behaviour of sub-national government units with the national commitments under the European Stability and Growth Pact. The Domestic Pact was revised in 2007 and 2008 to tighten the monitoring and sanctions framework and prevent some inefficient behaviour. However, some undesirable features still mar the new regime: no coordination exists between the Domestic Pact and the debt and tax constraints applied to local governments; a clear definition of the contribution of sub-national governments to aggregate compliance with the external rule is still lacking; flexibility has been introduced by means of an artificial reference budget balance; side effects on resource redistribution are ignored; and monitoring and sanctioning remain weak. Remedies for the above shortcomings can possibly be found in the domestic pacts of the other EMU countries. Most of all, the Domestic Pact should be adjusted to the specific characteristics of fiscal decentralization in Italy, where a large fiscal gap exists, revenue autonomy is constrained and a large share of the responsibility for spending is rigid and politically sensitiv...|$|R
