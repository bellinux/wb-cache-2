40|$|Online Booking: An {{opportunity}} or {{a threat}} to retail travel agents? Year after year, the booking preferences for independent travelers are diverging towards online booking. The impacts of online booking on travel agents {{can be measured in}} terms of opportunities and threats, and vary according to the size of travel agents, the target market as well as the business structure. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose the investment in online-booking technology as an opportunity to retail travel agents, enabling them to overcome the threats of direct reservation on their business. In this context, we will refer to previous studies and researches that evaluate the impacts of the macro environment, on the business of travel agents. A research study about online-booking led us to believe that, despite its negative <b>impacts,</b> <b>investing</b> in online-booking technology can still create a competitive advantage for travel agents.

50|$|Another concept {{important}} for understanding vulnerability in the United States is the climate gap. The climate gap is the inequitably {{negative impact on}} poor people {{and people of color}} due to the effects of climate change. Some of these negative impacts include higher cost of living expenses, higher incidences of heat related health consequences in urban areas that are likely to experience urban heat island effects, increased pollution in urban areas, and decreases in available jobs for poor people and people of color. Some suggested solutions to close the climate gap include suggesting legislative policies that would reduce the impact of climate change by reducing carbon emissions with the emphasis of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and toxic air pollution in neighborhoods that are already heavily impacted, usually urban centers. Other solutions include increasing access to quality health care for poor people and people of color, preparedness planning for urban heat island effects, identifying neighborhoods that {{are most likely to be}} <b>impacted,</b> <b>investing</b> in alternative fuel and energy research, and measuring the results of policy impacts.|$|R

Empirical data on travel are examined for structural regularity. The regions of a small city which emerge are tested by reassigning existing traffic to a modified transport network. A link in one region is changed to trace the permeation of link-volume changes through regional partitions. The results indicate a strong structure and degree of separability in the pattern of demand and use of a small urban network, which bodes well for more widespread application. ...|$|R

Lincoln University {{has been involved with}} this leaders programme since 1979 when it was launched with a grant from the Kellogg Foundation, USA. Today's farmers are under increasing pressure to adopt more efficient agricultural principles, making the best possible use of resources by minimising high energy inputs, such as pesticides, fertilisers, fossil fuels and water, without loss of food quality and yield. The challenges are to maintain and increase productivity and profitability, while reducing any potentially negative environmental <b>impacts.</b> <b>Investing</b> in new technology will help farmers meet these challenges. GPS (Global Positioning System) is one area that has the potential to meet some of the challenges faced by farmers today. However {{it is important to know}} that there is a timely economic return from any new investment in technology. The price of GPS/ precision farming technology has continued to decline as its capabilities increase. This could be a good time for the NZ arable farmer to invest in GPS. The three major uses of GPS in farming are mapping, input control and machine control. This allows farmers to improve agronomy, reduce error and change practice i. e. strip tillage farming. The advantage of using GPS / precision farming technology is input savings from more precise field application of seed, fertilizers, chemicals, fuel, and labour, as well as increased benefits to the farm production process, the ability to work over a longer period, reduced driver fatigue, and improve agronomy...|$|R
