5|$|StarCraft <b>focuses</b> <b>around</b> three {{distinct}} interstellar species: the psionic Protoss, the adaptable Terrans, and the insectoid Zerg. The game revolves around players collecting resources {{to construct a}} base, upgrade their militaries, and ultimately conquer opponents. Brood Wars gameplay remains fundamentally unchanged from that of StarCraft, although it made small alterations to unit costs and some abilities, and added some new units. These changes make rushing tactics—a factor that gained some criticism in the original StarCraft—less practical. The single-player campaign has an increased difficulty; missions are no longer entirely linear, and a greater focus on strategy is needed to complete missions. In addition, the game's artificial intelligence (AI) has been augmented so that AI-controlled players are more intelligent and tend to use tactics more effectively.|$|E
5|$|The Heirs of Fate saga, {{released}} after {{the rest of}} the DLC, <b>focuses</b> <b>around</b> the game's Child units. Two separate versions of the Avatar's child Kana, one male and one female, each journey with members of each version's cast to discover why a group of mysterious soldiers attacked their homes. It is revealed that they were never truly in their homes, as Anankos had transported them to Valla and attempted to trick them into killing each other. However, Azura's son, Shigure, broke the illusion and banded the two Kanas' armies together, only to leave them to face Anankos alone with the hidden verse of his mother's song. However, the army finds a way back, and helps to take down Anankos for one final time.|$|E
25|$|The series <b>focuses</b> <b>around</b> Angel (David Boreanaz), an Irish vampire who is over 200 years old. Angel {{was known}} as Angelus during his rampages across Europe, but was cursed with a soul, which gave him a {{conscience}} and guilt for centuries of murder and torture. He left Buffy the Vampire Slayer {{at the end of}} Season 3 to move to Los Angeles in search of redemption.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, Fred Barron was {{considering}} producing a British sitcom {{the same way}} sitcoms were produced in the U.S. My Family was to feature a group of writers rather than the standard one or two, something that had been attempted in the UK with shows including Goodnight Sweetheart and On the Buses, but was nevertheless atypical. My Family was consciously designed to have wide appeal, with characters viewers could build a relationship with {{in the same way}} as previous BBC sitcom 2point4 Children which <b>focuses</b> <b>around</b> a similar family unit.|$|E
25|$|Tomb Raider, {{also known}} as Lara Croft: Tomb Raider between 2001 and 2007, is a media {{franchise}} that originated with an action-adventure video game series created by British gaming company Core Design. Formerly owned by Eidos Interactive, then by Square Enix after their acquisition of Eidos in 2009, the franchise focuses on a fictional English archaeologist Lara Croft, who travels around the world searching for lost artefacts and infiltrating dangerous tombs and ruins. The gameplay generally <b>focuses</b> <b>around</b> action-adventure exploration of environments, solving puzzles, navigating hostile environments filled with traps, and fighting numerous enemies. Additional media has grown up around the theme {{in the form of}} film adaptations, comics and novels.|$|E

A new method of dueling with motorcycle-like vehicles called Duel Runners are used, and the duelists engage in games called Turbo Duels. The show {{is set in}} the distant future, where the upper class population live in New Domino City and the lower class in a remote island where Domino's sewage is transported, Satellite. Yusei Fudo, the 18-year-old protagonist, lives in Satellite and makes it his objective to reach his rival Jack Atlas, who lives in Domino. The series focuses on the five Signers, people embodied with a mark of one of the legendary Five Dragons, their conflict with the Dark Signers, and the Three Emperors of Yilaster.|$|E
25|$|Like Rex, Roman has a bionic arm, {{which he}} uses to trigger explosives. He is {{defeated}} by Yusei, but before he dies, he triggers an explosion that sends Yusei down into the pool Ener-D. His deck <b>focuses</b> <b>around</b> Spider type monsters, and specializes in changing an opponent's monster into defense mode to obtain counters for summoning his Earthbound Immortal Uru. Uru can control an opponent's monster by sacrificing one of his own. Roman is later defeated by Yusei, but he sets off an explosive in his mechanical arm before crumbling to dust, so that Yusei would fall into {{the gate to the}} Netherworld. His spirit remains in the world until Goodwin is defeated, at which point Roman joins his brother in the afterlife. His ace is the Dark Synchro Underground Arachnid.|$|E
25|$|Kyō no Go no Ni, Koharu Sakuraba's debut manga, {{has been}} adapted into an OVA and an anime {{and has been}} adapted into another OVA in 2009. In 2006, Shinkūkan {{animated}} the OVA that was directed by Makoto Sokuza. Each episode of the OVA is presented in five distinct chapters except for the special. In 2008, the manga was readapted into an anime that was animated by Xebec, produced by Starchild Records, directed by Tsuyoshi Nagasawa, and written by Takamitsu Kouno. Each episode of the anime is presented in four distinct chapters except for the thirteenth episode. In April 2009, Kodansha announced that Xebec will produce an OVA adaptation of Kyō no Go no Ni, directed again by Tsuyoshi Nagasawa and written by Takamitsu Kouno. The plot <b>focuses</b> <b>around</b> everyday life of students of class 5-2 and more specifically around Ryōta and his group of friends {{over the course of}} their fifth grade.|$|E

25|$|The game's story <b>focuses</b> <b>around</b> Vyse, a young air pirate in {{a fantasy}} world, {{and his friends}} {{as they attempt to}} stop the Valuan Empire from {{reviving}} ancient weapons with the potential to destroy the world. The game contained the traditional Japanese role-playing game mechanics of early Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest, entries, such as turn-based battles and experience point-based character progression, but put its own twist on the genre with having a greater focus on exploration, through allowing the player to fly and battle with, a large airship in 3D space among many floating islands and landmasses. The game was well received by critics, even becoming one of the best reviewed games on the Dreamcast, but the critical success did not translate to sales, with the game generally not considered to have performed well commercially. Sequels and re-releases have arisen over time as possibilities, but to date have not materialized to any actual releases, though the characters have been featured in a number of Sega-related properties, notably the Valkryia Chronicles series of video games.|$|E
25|$|Most {{games in}} the series are set in fictional locales {{modelled}} on cities, usually either Liberty City, Vice City or San Andreas, which are stand-ins for New York City, Miami {{and the state of}} California, respectively. The first game encompassed three fictional cities, while subsequent titles tend to emphasise a single setting. Gameplay focuses on an open world where the player can choose missions to progress an overall story, as well as engaging in side activities, all consisting of action-adventure, driving, third-person shooting, occasional role-playing, stealth and racing elements. The series <b>focuses</b> <b>around</b> many different protagonists who attempt to rise through the ranks of the criminal underworld, although their motives for doing so vary in each game. The series also has elements of the earlier beat 'em up games from the 16-bit era. The antagonists are commonly characters who have betrayed the protagonist or his organisation, or characters who have the most impact impeding the protagonist's progress. Film and music veterans have voiced characters, including Ray Liotta, Burt Reynolds, Dennis Hopper, Samuel L. Jackson, James Woods, Debbie Harry, Phil Collins, Axl Rose and Peter Fonda. With its British origin, the series contains satire and humour.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{management}} involves {{analyzing the}} market and credit risk that an investment bank or its clients take onto their balance sheet during transactions or trades. Credit risk <b>focuses</b> <b>around</b> capital markets activities, such as syndicated loans, bond issuance, restructuring, and leveraged finance. Market risk conducts review of sales and trading activities utilizing the VaR model and provide hedge-fund solutions to portfolio managers. Other risk groups include country risk, operational risk, and counterparty risks {{which may or may}} not exist on a bank to bank basis. Credit risk solutions are key part of capital market transactions, involving debt structuring, exit financing, loan amendment, project finance, leveraged buy-outs, and sometimes portfolio hedging. Front office market risk activities provide service to investors via derivative solutions, portfolio management, portfolio consulting, and risk advisory. Well-known risk groups in JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Barclays engage in revenue-generating activities involving debt structuring, restructuring, syndicated loans, and securitization for clients such as corporates, governments, and hedge funds. J.P. Morgan IB Risk works with investment banking to execute transactions and advise investors, although its Finance & Operation risk groups focus on middle office functions involving internal, non-revenue generating, operational risk controls. Credit default swap, for instance, is a famous credit risk hedging solution for clients invented by J.P. Morgan's Blythe Masters during the 1990s. The Loan Risk Solutions group within Barclays' investment banking division and Risk Management and Financing group housed in Goldman Sach's securities division are client-driven franchises. However, risk management groups such as operational risk, internal risk control, and legal risk are restrained to internal business functions including firm balance-sheet risk analysis and assigning trading cap that are independent of client needs, even though these groups may be responsible for deal approval that directly affects capital market activities. Risk management is a broad area, and like research, its roles can be client-facing or internal.|$|E

500|$|Who's Your Neighbor? is a 1917 silent American {{propaganda}} and drama film directed by S. Rankin Drew. The film's plot <b>focuses</b> <b>around</b> reformers who {{pass a law}} to force prostitutes, including Hattie Fenshaw, out of the red light district. Fenshaw becomes Bryant Harding's mistress and lives in an apartment next door to a reformer, and continues to ply her trade. After Fenshaw becomes familiar with Harding, his son, daughter and the daughter's fiance, {{the climax of the}} film occurs as the cast assembles at Fenshaw's apartment. Harding returns and a fight breaks out that results in the reformers' arrival and concludes with the presumption that Fenshaw returns to a place of [...] "legalized vice". The drama was written by Willard Mack and was his first foray into screen dramas. The film proved controversial, but is noted as a great success. The film originally debuted on June 15, 1917, but it was rejected by the National Board of Review and was later approved after a revision, but the film continued to be labeled as an immoral production. The film is presumed to be lost.|$|E
