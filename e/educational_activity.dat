2500|$|In retrospect, his biographer later observed, {{it seemed}} as though Corey was possessed by a [...] "fervent desire to write his way back into the Communist movement." [...] Corey seems to have had no qualms about the {{political}} role of the Communist Party, eagerly signing the manifesto of the League of Professional Groups for Foster and Ford, thereby endorsing the CPUSA's 1932 Presidential ticket. After the election, the League truncated its name to the League of Professional Groups and adopted a program written by Corey providing for ongoing political and <b>educational</b> <b>activity.</b> The Communist Party remained aloof from the organization, however, as the group sought to maintain financial and ideological autonomy from the party in order to better appeal to non-party left wing intellectuals. By the middle of 1933, lacking the CPUSA's publicity and financial support, the League had dissolved.|$|E
