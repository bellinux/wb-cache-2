40|$|Recent {{publications}} {{report the}} direct electrochemical detection <b>of</b> individual <b>enzyme</b> activity via collisions at microelectrodes, though `back of an envelope' calculations challenge {{the applicability of}} the experimental method. In the light of these studies, we present a comprehensive combined theoretical and computational analysis of the electrode response to a proximate and freely-diffusing enzyme generating an electroactive product. We further present experimental data for the enzyme catalase and critically discuss to what extent observed current transients can be unambiguously attributed to single enzyme collisions comparing detection via <b>electrolysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>enzyme</b> reaction products with detection through direct electron transfer reaction mediated via the enzyme...|$|R

40|$|The {{generation}} of hydrogen through the <b>electrolysis</b> <b>of</b> water has attracted attention as a promising way {{to produce and}} store energy using renewable energy sources. In this process, a catalyst {{is very important to}} achieve a high-energy conversion efficiency for the <b>electrolysis</b> <b>of</b> water. A good catalyst for water electrolysis should exhibit high catalytic activity, good stability, low cost and good scalability. Much research has been devoted to developing efficient catalysts for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Traditionally, it has been accepted that a material with high crystallinity is important to serve as a good catalyst for HER and/or OER. Recently, catalysts for HER and/or OER in the <b>electrolysis</b> <b>of</b> water splitting based on amorphous materials have received much interest in the scientific community owing to the abundant unsaturated active sites on the amorphous surface, which form catalytic centers for the reaction <b>of</b> the <b>electrolysis</b> <b>of</b> water. We summarize the recent advances of amorphous catalysts for HER, OER and overall water splitting by electrolysis and the related fundamental chemical reactions involved in the <b>electrolysis</b> <b>of</b> water. The current challenges confronting the <b>electrolysis</b> <b>of</b> water and the development of more efficient amorphous catalysts are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Water-induced {{degradation}} in ZnO-based ceramic varistors is reported. A comparison {{experiment was}} conducted in which some varistors were immersed in a 0. 05 M NaOH solution for some time while other varistors were placed in a 0. 05 M NaOH solution to evolve hydrogen on their silver electrode by <b>electrolysis</b> <b>of</b> water. No degradation occurred to those samples that were immersed in the NaOH solution; the leakage currents increased by orders of magnitude and the switch voltage remained unchanged in the samples treated by <b>electrolysis</b> <b>of</b> water. These {{results indicate that the}} degradation resulted from the reduction reaction of hydrogen atoms generated by <b>electrolysis</b> <b>of</b> water rather than the permeation of water into the ceramics. Because water can be formed on varistors by condensation of aqueous vapor in air and varistors are usually operated under electric fields, it is proposed that the reduction reaction of hydrogen atoms generated by <b>electrolysis</b> <b>of</b> water may be an important origin for the degradation in ZnO varistors.
