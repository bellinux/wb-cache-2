50|$|Based on an idea by Peter D. Dickinson {{the first}} {{calculator}} to support engineering notation displaying the power-of-ten exponent values was the HP-25 in 1975. It was implemented as a <b>dedicated</b> <b>display</b> mode {{in addition to}} scientific notation.|$|E
50|$|Export {{of target}} data: The radar {{not only has}} its own <b>dedicated</b> <b>display</b> and alarm system, but also outputs data to other systems that form the {{security}} network. A typical interface system today would include target data output over Extensible Markup Language (XML) at a useful target data rate (0.1 Hz to 1 Hz).|$|E
50|$|The 10th Battalion {{was noted}} for accepting, {{apparently}} without prejudice, {{significant numbers of}} Japanese-Canadians into its ranks during the war. Other Canadian battalions rejected these volunteers on racial grounds; several were decorated for bravery during their service with the 10th Battalion. The Calgary Highlanders Gallery at The Military Museums in Calgary has a <b>dedicated</b> <b>display</b> to the contributions of these soldiers.|$|E

50|$|The {{philosophy}} {{behind the}} CPC series was twofold, firstly {{the concept was}} of an “all-in-one”, where the computer, keyboard and its data storage device were combined in a single unit, and sold with its own <b>dedicated</b> <b>display</b> monitor. Most home computers at that time such as Sinclair’s ZX series, the Commodore 64 and the BBC Micro relied {{on the use of}} the domestic television set and a separately connected tape recorder or disk drive. In itself, the all-in-one concept was not new, having been seen before on business-oriented machines and the Commodore PET, but in the home computer space, it predated the Apple Macintosh by almost a year.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the first}} 16 {{years of its}} existence, the Museum had no formal home and {{artifacts}} were displayed throughout the USGA offices in New York. In 1951, when the Association purchased the property at 40 East 38th Street in New York City, the first <b>dedicated</b> <b>display</b> space for the collections was created and the Museum was formally opened. Since 1972, the USGA’s headquarters in Far Hills, New Jersey, has provided public exhibition galleries, staff offices and collections storage for the Museum. The Museum is housed in a building designed in 1919 by John Russell Pope, a noted architect who also designed the National Archives Building and the Jefferson Memorial.|$|E
5000|$|Text mode {{avoids the}} problem of {{expensive}} memory by having <b>dedicated</b> <b>display</b> hardware re-render each line of text from characters into pixels with each scan of the screen by the cathode ray. In turn, the display hardware needs only enough memory to store the pixels equivalent to one line of text (or even less) at a time. Thus, the computer's screen buffer only stores and knows about the underlying text characters (hence the name [...] "text mode") and the only location where the actual pixels representing those characters exist as a single unified image is the screen itself, as viewed by the user (thanks to the phenomenon of persistence of vision).|$|E
5000|$|Unlike the Pravetz series 8 {{personal}} computers, {{manufactured in}} Bulgaria, which were equipped with decent <b>dedicated</b> <b>displays,</b> floppy discs and good quality keyboards, the entire series used a TV {{set for a}} monitor (by standard TV-UHF via coaxial cable, composite video, or RGB) and a standard tape recorder as data storage. The keyboards were of low quality. The KC 85/1 used an integrated calculator-style keyboard with small [...] "keys" [...] of hard plastics, while KC 85/2-4 used a separate keyboard driven by a remote control IC.|$|R

5000|$|Early {{handheld}} games used simple {{mechanisms to}} interact with players, often limited to illuminated buttons and sound effects. Notable early handheld games included Waco's Electro Tic-Tac-Toe (1972), the Mattel Auto Race (1976), and Mattel Electronic Football (1977), which featured very simple red-LED displays; gameplay involved the player pressing buttons to move his car or quarterback icon (represented by a bright dot) to avoid obstacles (represented by less bright dots). In 1978 the Milton Bradley Company entered the handheld market with Simon, a simple color-and-sound-matching game. Simon had no <b>dedicated</b> <b>display,</b> but featured four colored, lighted buttons; the original version was {{large enough to be}} used as a tabletop game or a handheld; later versions became increasingly smaller. The same year, Parker Brothers also released Merlin, a more sophisticated handheld which could play six different games using an array of 11 buttons with integrated LEDs. Despite their relative simplicity, each of these early games was highly successful.|$|E
5000|$|In 1975 Commodore {{introduced}} {{a number of}} scientific calculators (like the SR4148/SR4148R and SR4190R) providing a variable scientific notation, where pressing the [...] and [...] keys shifted the exponent and decimal point by ±1 in scientific notation. Between 1976 and 1980 the same exponent shift facility was also available on some Texas Instruments calculators of the pre-LCD era such as early SR-40, TI-30 and TI-45 model variants utilizing (...) instead. This {{can be seen as}} a pre-cursor to a feature implemented on many Casio calculators since about 1978/1979 (f.e. in the FX-501P/FX-502P), where number display in engineering notation is available on demand by the single press of a (...) button (instead of having to activate a <b>dedicated</b> <b>display</b> mode as on most other calculators), and subsequent button presses would shift the exponent and decimal point of the number displayed by ±3 in order to easily let results match a desired prefix. Some graphical calculators (for example the fx-9860G) in the 2000s also support the display of some SI prefixes (f, p, n, µ, m, k, M, G, T, P, E) as suffixes in engineering mode.|$|E
5000|$|On 10 August 2015, Melbourne City {{confirmed}} {{that they had}} signed Fornaroli on a two-year deal. He scored his first goal for Melbourne City on his debut on 26 August 2015 against Wellington Phoenix in an FFA Cup match. In the following round of the FFA Cup, the quarterfinals he scored two goals against Heidelberg United. Fornaroli scored his first A-League goal in a 3-2 defeat to rivals Melbourne Victory. The following week Fornaroli scored a brace in City's 3-1 victory over the Central Coast Mariners. He continued his rich scoring form with a brace against Adelaide United making him the top scorer of the league by round 5. Fornaroli also became the quickest A-League player to score 11 goals in the league. On 5 March 2016, Fornaroli notched a hat-trick against Sydney FC at AAMI Park {{to become the first}} A-League player to score 20 goals in a regular season. Melburnians, a City supporters group, honoured Fornaroli with a <b>dedicated</b> <b>display,</b> reading [...] "El Tuna 23 Rey de Melbourne", at City's next home game on 18 March 2016. Fornaroli capped the season by winning the league golden boot, scoring 23 goals in the regular season (5 ahead of his nearest challenger) and was the joint winner of Melbourne City's Player of the Year award.|$|E

40|$|Circuit {{produces}} PPI {{display on}} conventional X-Y oscilloscope. Circuit requires three inputs. First is once-per-scan pulse to synchronize display to north, relative heading, or another reference direction. Second is once-per-degree-of-rotation pulse to advance sweep rotation. Third input is normal sweep ramp. Duration of ramp corresponds to maximum displayed range. Changing ramp duration, while holding its peak amplitude constant, changes maximum displayed range. Conventional methods {{to accomplish this}} task use mechanically-driven deflection coils or mechanically-driven sine and cosine potentiometers, requiring mechanical preventive maintenance plus <b>dedicated</b> <b>display</b> indicator. New method displays radar sweep on any conventional storage oscilloscope...|$|E
40|$|Providing homeowners with {{real-time}} {{feedback on}} their electricity consumption through a <b>dedicated</b> <b>display</b> device {{has been shown}} to reduce consumption by approximately 6 - 10 %. However, recent advances in smart grid technology have enabled larger sample sizes and more representative sample selection and recruitment methods for display trials. By analyzing these factors using data from current studies, this paper argues that a realistic, large-scale conservation effect from feedback is in the range of 3 - 5 %. Subsequent analysis shows that providing real-time feedback may not be a cost effective strategy for reducing carbon emissions in Australia, but that it may enable additional benefits such as customer retention and peak-load shift...|$|E

40|$|Translucent volume {{rendering}} is {{a robust}} and efficient direct volume-rendering technique for capturing optical effects, like subsurface scattering, translucency, and volumetric shadows. However, {{due to the}} limited computing and memory resources of the recent consumer graphics hardware, high-resolution volume data can still hardly be interactively visualized by this method. In this paper we present the theoretical aspects and implementation details of a parallelization scheme for translucent volume rendering. Our method is a three-pass parallel rendering algorithm with parallel compositing, based on object-space distribution of the data among the rendering nodes. In the first pass the 2 D shadow maps are computed {{and sent to the}} effected nodes. In the second pass the nodes render their associated subvolumes by sequential translucent volume rendering. The generated framelets are then visualized by a <b>dedicated</b> <b>display</b> node in the third pass...|$|E
40|$|Projector-based {{augmentation}} approaches {{hold the}} potential of combining the advantages of well-establishes spatial virtual reality and spatial augmented reality. Immersive, semi-immersive and augmented visualizations can be realized in everyday environments – {{without the need for}} special projection screens and <b>dedicated</b> <b>display</b> configurations. Limitations of mobile devices, such as low resolution and small field of view, focus constrains, and ergonomic issues can be overcome in many cases by the utilization of projection technology. Thus, applications that do not require mobility can benefit from efficient spatial augmentations. Examples range from edutainment in museums (such as storytelling projections onto natural stone walls in historical buildings) to architectural visualizations (such as augmentations of complex illumination simulations or modified surface materials in real building structures). This chapter describes projector-camera methods and multi-projector techniques that aim at correcting geometric aberrations, compensating local and global radiometric effects, and improving focus properties of images projected onto everyday surfaces...|$|E
