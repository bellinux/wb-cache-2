40|$|Objective: Prescribing {{errors are}} {{a major cause of}} {{iatrogenic}} patient morbidity and therefore interventions aimed at preventing the adverse outcomes of these errors are likely to result in cost reduction. However, it is unclear whether the costs associated with these preventive measures are outweighed by the cost reductions (benefits). Therefore, a study was set up to analyse costs and benefits of detecting prescribing errors by hospital pharmacy staff. Design: During 5 consecutive days in two Dutch hospitals in February 2000 all medication orders, in which prescribing errors were detected, were analysed. A cost-benefit analysis was performed, based on direct medical costs only. The benefit-to-cost ratio was calculated by taking into account the net time hospital pharmacy staff needed for the prevention of the error (this included potential time saving for nursing staff, when an error was prevented by hospital pharmacy staff instead of nursing staff), as well as taking into account the possible consequences of the prescribing error (were the error not prevented). Results: A total of 3540 orders, of which 351 contained prescribing errors (9. 9 %), were analysed. During the 1 -week period investigated, time-investment of the pharmacy staff had net costs of EUR 285 (2000 values). During the same period estimated benefits related to this <b>investment</b> were <b>EUR</b> 9867. The finding of higher benefits than costs was robust in sensitivity analysis. Conclusions: From this study it can be concluded that prevention of prescribing errors by hospital pharmacy staff results in higher benefits than the costs related to the net time investment...|$|R
40|$|The {{study is}} based on an {{analysis}} of the opportunities provided by The Investment Plan for Europe. The Plan, launched in December 2014, aims at stimulating additional <b>investment</b> at least <b>EUR</b> 315 billion in real economy in the 2015 - 2017 period and making the most of every public euro mobilized through both new and existing instrument, in order to achieve the high multiplier effect. The challenge for the Member States is to put the funds made available by these instruments to productive use in order to support sustainable jobs and growth in Europe. In this context, Romania is facing a major challenge: to promote projects of interest to investors, economically viable, sufficiently mature and consistent with EU policy priorities. According official sources, until the mid - March 2016, only two projects was selected for financing through The Investment Plan for Europe. The study contributes to the identification of the new innovative financial instruments that could improve the access to finance in general and to Romanian projects especially. The analysis uses the most recent official data, official documents published by the European Commission and other institutions in the field...|$|R

Our hypothesis is that a potential pension reform would have a positive significant impact on property investment volumes via institutions constituting the second pillar. In the first step, we provide analysis of pension reforms recently applied in Slovakia, Hungary, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Given analysis of selected countries and specifics of the proposed Czech pension reform, we estimate that the institutions in the second pillar may face additional yearly cash inflows beginning on EUR 1. 23 billion in 2013 and further increasing to EUR 2. 59 billion in 2017. Furthermore, we estimate that a likely share allocation by second pillar institutions into real estate would lie in the region of 0 - 14 % depending on the discrete decision of the regulators. Using a conservative leverage of 40 % for bank financing, we estimate that the expected investment volumes allocated by second pillar institutions into real estate would be EUR 61 - 287 million in year 2013. Given the average <b>investment</b> volumes of <b>EUR</b> 1334 million p. a. allocated into commercial [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{provide an}} {{overview}} of public support for the European car industry during the past decade. First, we identify the most relevant instruments of public support, and review their economic assessment. The European Commission increasingly recognizes the role of economic analysis in controlling public aid to the car industry, although the degree of economic assessment varies across di¤erent instruments of public support and individual state aid cases. Moreover, the state aid legislative framework is open to derogations and interpretations. In particular, the Temporary Framework, approved by the Commission to tackle the last financial and economic crisis de facto implied a relaxation of the state aid rules and foresaw no formal control of individual state aids. Second, we aim to estimate the amount of public support for European car manu- facturers. Three factors complicate the overall quantification of public support for each instrument: (i) the Commission does not scrutinize, and hence does not quantify all public support measures; (ii) the available information depends on whether the state aid is granted to individual companies or in the form of general schemes; and (iii) the available information depends on whether the aid is granted {{in the form of a}} grant, soft loan or guarantee. Our lower bound estimate of state aid suggests that the aid declined over the pre-crisis period, but peaked at EUR 1. 2 billion as a response to the last financial and economic crisis in 2009. Perhaps even more strikingly, this state aid was combined with an unprecedented amount of public support granted through scrapping schemes of at least EUR 4. 0 billion, and loans from the European <b>Investment</b> Bank of <b>EUR</b> 2. 8 billion, or an equivalent of EUR 400 million of "aid element". In conclusion, the existence of multiple public support instruments at different levels may create coordination problems and a lack of transparency, in spite of the Commis- sion's efforts. The lack of transparency in turn poses a challenge for the quantification of state aid and non-state aid support to any industry or sector. This paper provides a first step towards informing the policy debate on the e¤ects of public support to the car sector, and also stimulates the academic interest in the subject of state aid, and - more generally - public transfers to companies...|$|R
40|$|Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) {{are major}} drivers {{of social and}} {{economic}} change. They are also one of the key Thematic Objectives (TOs) in the European Structural and Investment Fund (ESIF). The aim of these funds is to strengthen economic, social and territorial cohesion within the European Union. ICTs not only constitute an important sector themselves, but are also an important enabler of other sectors. This is why, analysis of ESIF data on planned ICT <b>investments</b> show <b>EUR</b> 12. 2 billion encoded in the dedicated TO, but when ICT categories in other TOs are included, this amount almost doubles, to EUR 21. 4 billion. Finding out more about the ICT investment plans of EU Member States and regions is not always a straightforward process. The available data for ESIF are structured in TOs and Categories of Intervention (CoIs); however, ICT investment often funds activities beyond the dedicated TOs and CoIs. To obtain a better picture of planned ICT investments, the European Commission Directorate General for Communications Networks, Content & Technology (DG CONNECT) and the JRC Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (JRC-IPTS) have developed an online tool to display planned ICT investment data on a regional basis. This tool will help EC officials, national and regional policymakers working on ICT issues, and beneficiaries of ESIF, to understand what kind of ICT activities are being planned in Europe. The ICT monitoring tool can be searched using a number of predefined filters, or searches of TOs and CoIs can be customised. The tool also contains a database of keywords built up by a semantic search for keywords in Operational Programmes (OPs). This database allows the user to identify OPs that mention a number of ICT activities more frequently than others, and to identify if a specific topic is mentioned in a region at all. The data set included in the tool is based on an in-depth study of individual OPs, as well as on aggregated data sets. When studying the available data, we found that Thematic Objective 2 (TO 2) does not account for all planned ESIF investments in ICT. Using a broader set of CoIs, planned spending on ICT almost doubled, from 3. 8 % to around 6. 6 % of the combined total of European Regional Development Funds (ERDF), the European Social Fund (ESF), Cohesion Funds (CF) and European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). However, it is likely that even this method fails to capture all planned investments, as respondents to our study indicated that substantial investments in ICT will be allocated to other categories, which would increase ESIF investments in ICT to EUR 35. 5 billion. However, this estimate is not currently included in the tool, as the methods of estimating investments are not judged to be adequate. This range of different amounts of investment reflects the dual nature of ICT as an important sector and activity in itself, as well as an enabling technology in other public and private activities. Taking the moderate estimates, the EU Member States that plan by far the largest investments in ICT in absolute terms are Poland, Italy and Spain; the regions with the largest planned investments are Campania (IT), Sicilia (IT), Andalucía (ES), Slaskie (PL) and Puglia (IT). For example, the region of Campania plans to invest more ESIF in ICT than the whole of Germany. The greatest investments will be in broadband and ICT infrastructures (EUR 6. 9 billion), e-Inclusion and digital skills (EUR 3. 9 billion), e-Government (EUR 3. 4 billion), and smart cities and smart grids (EUR 3. 1 billion). To get a more in-depth view of future plans, we carried out a keyword search of ESIF data. Among the most frequently mentioned keywords are ICT innovation, e-Inclusion, broadband and digital content. This is partly because these keywords are broad and all-encompassing, but the findings also reflect the ambition of many regions to invest in ICT-based innovation activities. Quite substantial ICT investments will go to ICT-based innovation and digital content, but this will be listed under CoIs related to support of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and research and innovation, rather than the core CoIs for planned ICT investments.
