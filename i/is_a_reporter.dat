2500|$|They {{focused on}} a genealogical error in The Contention, which they argue seems {{unlikely}} {{to have been made}} by an author, and is therefore only attributable to a reporter. In The Contention, when York sets out his claim to the throne, he identifies Edmund of Langley as Edward III's second son, instead of his fifth. In 2 Henry VI, Langley is correctly placed in the genealogy. This error renders unnecessary York's need to claim the throne through his mother's ancestry: were he descended from the second son, he himself would be descended directly from an elder son than Henry. It has been argued that [...] "no one who understood what he was writing – that is, no author – could have made this error, but someone parroting someone else's work, of which he himself had but a dim understanding – that <b>is,</b> <b>a</b> <b>reporter</b> – easily could." ...|$|E

[...] Other newspapers are seldom mentioned on the show. [...] In his book Watching with The Simpsons: Television, Parody, and Intertextuality, Jonathan Gray discusses a scene from [...] "Homer Defined" [...] that shows Homer reading a USA Today with the cover story: [...] "America's Favorite Pencil– #2 is #1". Lisa sees this title and criticizes the newspaper as a [...] "flimsy hodge-podge of high-brass factoids and Larry King", to which Homer responds that it is [...] "the only paper in America that's not afraid to tell the truth: that everything is just fine." [...] In the book, Gray says this scene is used by the show's producers to criticize [...] "how often the news is wholly toothless, sacrificing journalism for sales, and leaving us not with important public information, but with America's Favorite Pencil".|$|E

2500|$|This {{explains}} {{that it was}} Lord Scales' daughter (Elizabeth de Scales) who was to marry Lady Grey's brother (Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl of Rivers), and Lady Grey's son (Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset) who was to marry the daughter of Lord Bonville (Cecily Bonville). As such, based on the inconsistency between Scales marrying Bonfield's daughter in True Tragedy and Scales' daughter marrying Grey's brother in 3 Henry VI, Alexander argued that {{the representation of the}} scene in True Tragedy is completely nonsensical and probably came about because the reporter became confused about who was married whom. Furthermore, unlike the account in True Tragedy, the version in 3 Henry VI corresponds closely to the chronicle material found in Hall ("the heir of the Lord Scales [...] hath married to his wife's brother, the heir also of the Lord Bonville and Harrington he hath given to his wife's son, and the heir of the Lord Hungerford he hath granted to the Lord Hastings"). In relation to mistakes like this, {{it has been argued that}} [...] "no one who understood what he was writing, that is – no author – could have made such error, but someone parroting someone else's work of which he himself had but a dim understanding – that <b>is,</b> <b>a</b> <b>reporter</b> – could have." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{who would}} stir us now by fiction must either {{give us an}} entirely new background, or reveal to us the soul of man in its {{innermost}} workings. The first is for the moment being done for us by Mr. Rudyard Kipling. As one turns over the pages of his Plain Tales from the Hills, one feels as if one were seated under a palm-tree reading life by superb flashes of vulgarity. The bright colours of the bazaars dazzle one's eyes. The jaded, second-rate Anglo-Indians are in exquisite incongruity with their surroundings. The mere lack of style in the story-teller gives an odd journalistic realism to what he tells us. From {{the point of view}} of literature Mr. Kipling is a genius who drops his aspirates. From {{the point of view of}} life, he <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>reporter</b> who knows vulgarity better than any one has ever known it. Dickens knew its clothes and its comedy. Mr. Kipling knows its essence and its seriousness. He is our first authority on the second-rate, and has seen marvellous things through keyholes, and his backgrounds are real works of art. As for the second condition, we have had Browning, and Meredith is with us. But there is still much to be done in the sphere of introspection. People sometimes say that fiction is getting too morbid. As far as psychology is concerned, it has never been morbid enough. We have merely touched the surface of the soul, that is all. In one single ivory cell of the brain there are stored away things more marvellous and more terrible than even they have dreamed of, who, like the author of Le Rouge et le Noir, have sought to track the soul into its most secret places, and to make life confess its dearest sins. Still, there is a limit even to the number of untried backgrounds, and it is possible that a further development of the habit of introspection may prove fatal to that creative faculty to which it seeks to supply fresh material. I myself am inclined to think that creation is doomed. It springs from too primitive, too natural an impulse. However this may be, it is certain that the subject-matter at the disposal of creation is always diminishing, while the subject-matter of criticism increases daily. There are always new attitudes for the mind, and new points of view. The duty of imposing form upon chaos does not grow less as the world advances. There was never a time when Criticism was more needed than it is now. It is only by its means that Humanity can become conscious of the point at which it has arrived.--The Critic as Artist.|$|E
60|$|GILBERT. It is to {{criticism}} that the future belongs. The subject- matter {{at the disposal of}} creation becomes every day more limited in extent and variety. Providence and Mr. Walter Besant have exhausted the obvious. If creation is to last at all, it can only do so on the condition of becoming far more critical than it is at present. The old roads and dusty highways have been traversed too often. Their charm has been worn away by plodding feet, and they have lost that element of novelty or surprise which is so essential for romance.
