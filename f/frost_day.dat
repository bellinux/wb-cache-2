40|$|Understanding {{changes in}} frost events is vital given their impacts on crops. This study {{examines}} monthly <b>frost</b> <b>day</b> trends in southern Australia, using Australian homogeneous temperature stations. Century-scale annual <b>frost</b> <b>day</b> trends show decreases consistent with expectations in a warming climate. The past 32 years however exhibit {{more complex and}} seemingly contradictory changes. At some locations increases in annual number of frost days are observed, while other lo- cations show decreases more consistent with the longer term trend. Assessing monthly trends, we nd a consistent increase in frost days at all stations in south- east Australia in late autumn (May). The trends are downwards {{during the winter months}} (June, July and August) indicating a {{decrease in the number of}} frost days. In early spring (August and September), the sign of the trend varies substantially between stations. Similarly, southwest Western Australia has experienced in- creases in the monthly number of frost days. However, in contrast to southeast Australia, the increases are observed throughout the second half of the cold sea- son. We examine the relationship with the concurrent recent drying since the 1990 s in southeast Australia and since the 1970 s in southwest Western Australia. In dry periods during the winter half year, clear-sky conditions are expected to occur more frequently, leading to larger diurnal temperature ranges and colder night-time tem- peratures. This study provides further evidence that southeastern Australian <b>frost</b> <b>day</b> increases are linked to concurrent rainfall declines by analysing the relationship between number of frost days and number of precipitation days...|$|E
40|$|Most {{studies of}} {{evolutionary}} responses {{to climate change}} have focused on phenological responses to warming, and provide only weak evidence for evolutionary adaptation. This could be because phenological changes are more weakly linked to fitness than more direct mechanisms of climate change impacts, such as selective mortality during extreme weather events which have immediate fitness consequences for the individuals involved. Studies examining these other mechanisms {{may be more likely}} to show evidence for evolutionary adaptation. To test this, we quantify regional population responses of a small resident passerine (winter wren Troglodytes troglodytes) to a measure of winter severity (number of <b>frost</b> <b>days).</b> Annual population growth rate was consistently negatively correlated with this measure, but the point at which different populations achieved stability (λ = 1) varied across regions and was closely correlated with the historic average number of <b>frost</b> <b>days,</b> providing strong evidence for local adaptation. Despite this, regional variation in abundance remained negatively related to the regional mean number of winter <b>frost</b> <b>days,</b> potentially as a result of a time-lag in the rate of evolutionary response to climate change. As expected from Bergmann's rule, individual wrens were heavier in colder regions, suggesting that local adaptation may be mediated through body size.

For percentile-based indices, trends of extreme events related to minimum temperature (Tmin) were greater in magnitude than those related to maximum temperature (Tmax). For absolute-value based indices, maximum Tmax, minimum Tmin, and summer days all show increasing trends, while <b>frost</b> <b>days</b> and the diurnal temperature range (DTR) show significant decreasing trends. In addition, there was a decrease in extreme cold events in most parts of east HKH, particularly in Southwest China and the Tibetan Plateau, while there was a general increase in extreme warm events over the entire HKH. Finally, the change in extreme cold events in the HKH appears to be more sensitive to elevation (with cold nights and cold days decreasing with elevation), whereas the change in warm extremes (warm nights, warm days, and maximum Tmax) shows no detectable relationship with elevation. <b>Frost</b> <b>days</b> and minimum Tmin also have a good relationship with elevation, and the trend in <b>frost</b> <b>days</b> decreases with an increase in elevation while the trend in minimum Tmin increases with an increase in elevation...|$|R

Increasing trends in frost-related yield losses were simulated in regions where no signifi-cant trend of frost occurrence was observed, due to higher mean temperatures accelerating crop development and causing sensitive post-heading stages to occur earlier, during the frost risk period. Simulations indicated that with frost-tolerant lines the mean national yield could be improved by up to 20 % through (i) reduced frost damage (~ 10 % improvement) and (ii) the ability to use earlier sowing dates (adding a further 10 % improvement).

The dataset includes six mostly independent climate variables (mean temperature, diurnal temperature range, precipitation, wet-day frequency, vapour pressure and cloud cover). Maximum and minimum temperatures have been arithmetically derived from these. Secondary variables (<b>frost</b> <b>day</b> frequency and potential evapotranspiration) have been estimated from the six primary variables using well-known formulae.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{temperature}} rise leads to an earlier onset of spring in wild plant species and that farmers are not keeping track of climate change. Crop growth models and experiments show yield gains to be obtained from earlier sowing. Why do farmers not sow earlier? We propose simple models on the relation between several weather variables and farmers’ sowing dates and test these models with 392 observed weekly sugar beet sowing percentages in the Netherlands. Data showed no correlation between spring temperature and sowing dates. However when we corrected for number of <b>frost</b> <b>days</b> in spring, we clearly saw earlier sowing at higher temperatures. Frost causes crumbling of the soil resulting in a nice seedbed; farmers sow later when there have been less <b>frost</b> <b>days.</b> Temperature rise “makes” farmers sow earlier, but the number or <b>frost</b> <b>days</b> simultaneously decreases and this “makes” farmers sow later. The combined effect is that temperature rise leads to only a small net advance in sowing date, 2 days per 1 °C according to our model. Many climate change studies have assumed advances in sowing date are often larger than likely based on historical trends and models developed in this paper. Such studies may well be overly optimistic in projected yield gains that follow from earlier sowing. Our results also revealed that sowing dates were correlated with the sum of solar radiation over the preceding 7 – 10 months. This correlation remained significant also when other weather variables (rain, temperature, <b>frost</b> <b>days)</b> were accounted for.

The climate engineering and termination periods are investigated. During the climate engineering period, both schemes, as intended, offset temperature increases by about 60 % globally, but are more effective in the low latitudes and exhibit some residual warming in the Arctic (especially in the case of SALT which is only applied in the low latitudes). In both climate engineering scenarios, extreme temperature changes are similar to the mean temperature changes over much of the globe. The exceptions are the mid- and high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, where high temperatures (90 th percentile of the distribution) of the climate engineering period compared to RCP 4. 5 control period rise less than the mean, and cold temperatures (10 th percentile), much more than the mean.

The consistency and discrepancy of extreme indices between reanalyses and observations (303 stations) are assessed. In most cases, temperature indices between NCEP/NCAR and ECMWF have good agreements. For both reanalysis, cold days/nights have decreased, while warm days/nights have increased since 1980. Temperatures of the coldest days/nights and warmest days/nights significantly increase over the entire China, and the diurnal temperature range demonstrates slight variations; the amounts of growing season length, and summer/tropical days have increased, consistent with the decrease in numbers of frost/ice days.

Results indicate: (1) Most warm (cold) extreme temperature indices have shown significantly positive (negative) trends in the Tarim River Basin in past five decades, while only slight changes in precipitation extremes can be observed. From the spatial perspective, more significantly warm (cold) extremes are found in the desert zones than in upstream mountain zones (i. e., the Tian Shan Mountain and Kunlun Mountain systems which surround the basin).

In this study, on the basis of daily maximum and minimum air temperature at 62 meteorological stations in the Yellow River basin, the changes in 13 indices of temperature extremes recommended by the ETCCDI were investigated in the Yellow River basin from 1961 to 2011. Both cold extremes and warm extremes showed a warming trend, with a large proportion of stations having statistically significant trends for most temperature indices. Because of a faster increase in minimum temperature than maximum temperature, diurnal temperature range (DTR) has decreased by - 0. 07 C degrees/decade. For cold extremes indices, i. e. coldest night (TNn), coldest day (TXn), cool nights (TN 10 p), cool days (TX 10 p), <b>frost</b> <b>day</b> (FD) and icing day (ID), the trends during the period of 1961 - 2011 were 0. 23 and 0. 22 C degrees/decade, and - 5. 23, - 3. 31, - 2. 61 and - 3. 16 days/decade, respectively. For warm extremes, i. e. warmest night (TNx), warmest day (TXx), warm nights (TN 90 p), warm days (TX 90 p), warm spell duration index (WSDI) and growing season length (GSL), the trends were 0. 20 and 0. 21 C degrees/decade, and 3. 80, 3. 26, 2. 93 and 4. 81 days/decade, respectively.

Winter composites of temperature and precipitation extreme indicators were examined for different phases of the AO and ENSO during the 1926 – 2000 period. Overall, the AO is a better predictor of winter warm nights, while the ENSO is a better predictor of consecutive dry days in the northeast United States. 1...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSimulations from a {{multi-model}} ensemble for the RCP 4. 5 {{climate change}} scenario for the 21 st century, and for two solar radiation management (SRM) schemes (stratospheric sulfate injection (G 3), SULF and marine cloud brightening by sea salt emission SALT) have been analysed in terms {{of changes in the}} mean and extremes of surface air temperature and precipitation. The climate engineering and termination periods are investigated. During the climate engineering period, both schemes, as intended, offset temperature increases by about 60 % globally, but are more effective in the low latitudes and exhibit some residual warming in the Arctic (especially in the case of SALT which is only applied in the low latitudes). In both climate engineering scenarios, extreme temperature changes are similar to the mean temperature changes over much of the globe. The exceptions are the mid-and high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, where high temperatures (90 th percentile of the distribution) of the climate engineering period compared to RCP 4. 5 control period rise less than the mean, and cold temperatures (10 th per-centile), much more than the mean. This aspect of the SRM schemes is also reflected in simulated reduction in the <b>frost</b> <b>day</b> frequency of occurrence for both schemes. However, summer day frequency of occurrence increases less in the SALT experiment than the SULF experiment, especially over the tropics. Precipitation extremes in the two SRM scenarios act differently – the SULF experiment more effectively mitigates extreme precipitation increases over land compared to the SALT experiment. A reduction in dry spell occurrence over land is observed in the SALT experiment. The SULF experiment has a slight increase in the length of dry spells. A strong termination effect is found for the two climate engineering schemes, with large temperature increases especially in the Arctic. Globally, SULF is more effective in reducing extreme temperature increases over land than SALT. Extreme precipitation increases over land is also more reduced in SULF than the SALT experiment. However, globally SALT decreases the frequency of dry spell length and reduces the occurrence of hot days compared to SULF...|$|E

The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate past and predicted changes in minimum temperature (T[subscript min]) and six frost indices in the Catskill Mountains covering six reservoir watersheds. Studied frost indices included (1) number of frost days, (2) number of months with frost, (3) last spring freeze date (LSF), (4) first fall freeze date (FFF), (5) growing season length (GSL), and (6) frost season length. Past changes in the frost indices were studied using observed daily T[subscript min] for each watershed for the periods 1960 – 2008. Future changes in frost indices for the periods (2045 – 2065 and 2080 – 2100) were studied for emission scenarios (A 1 B, A 2, and B 1) downscaled from global climate models GCMs). Results indicated a general increase in average Tmin and GSL and a decrease in number of frost days, months with frost, frost season length, earlier LSF, and later FFF from the historical to the future periods, and the magnitude of change varied among the watersheds and GCMs. For the period 1960 – 2000, in all watersheds (except Cannonsville), LSF occurred earlier by 2. 6 – 4. 3 [*]days/decade, FFF occurred later by 2. 7 – 3. 2 [*]day/decade, and GSL was longer by 2. 4 – 4 [*]day/decade. Among the scenarios and GCMs, LSF occurred earlier by 4 – 11 and 4. 5 – 15 [*]days/decade for the periods 2045 – 2065 and 2081 – 2100, respectively; FFF occurred later by 1 – 10 and 4 – 13 [*]days/decade for the periods 2045 – 2065 and 2081 – 2100, respectively; and GSL was longer by 10 – 25 and 13 – 40 [*]days/decade for the periods 2045 – 2065 and 2081 – 2100, respectively. The increase in GSL is expected to affect hydrologic, ecosystem, and biogeochemical processes with increased net primary productivity and a resulting increase in total annual evapotranspiration...|$|E
40|$|Strategic Priority Research Program-Climate Change: Carbon Budget and Relevant Issues" of the Chinese Academy of Sciences XDA 05090309 ；National Science and Technology Pillar Program of China 2012 BAB 02 B 00 	The {{variability}} of temperature extremes was widely {{discussed in the}} past few decades worldwide associated with global warming, which impacted the hydrological cycle and energy balance. In this study, on the basis of daily maximum and minimum air temperature at 62 meteorological stations in the Yellow River basin, the changes in 13 indices of temperature extremes recommended by the ETCCDI were investigated in the Yellow River basin from 1961 to 2011. Both cold extremes and warm extremes showed a warming trend, with a large proportion of stations having statistically significant trends for most temperature indices. Because of a faster increase in minimum temperature than maximum temperature, diurnal temperature range (DTR) has decreased by - 0. 07 C degrees/decade. For cold extremes indices, i. e. coldest night (TNn), coldest day (TXn), cool nights (TN 10 p), cool days (TX 10 p), <b>frost</b> <b>day</b> (FD) and icing day (ID), the trends during the period of 1961 - 2011 were 0. 23 and 0. 22 C degrees/decade, and - 5. 23, - 3. 31, - 2. 61 and - 3. 16 days/decade, respectively. For warm extremes, i. e. warmest night (TNx), warmest day (TXx), warm nights (TN 90 p), warm days (TX 90 p), warm spell duration index (WSDI) and growing season length (GSL), the trends were 0. 20 and 0. 21 C degrees/decade, and 3. 80, 3. 26, 2. 93 and 4. 81 days/decade, respectively. In general, the indices have the largest change magnitudes in the arid and semi-arid subregions, followed by the high-elevation sub-region, and the indices have the smallest changes in the eastern monsoon sub-region. Relationships between the changes in the temperature extremes and the changes in the large-scale atmospheric circulations were studied. Results show that the changes in the temperature extremes were consistent with the changes in the area and strength of Northern Hemisphere Subtropical High (NHSH) and Northern Hemisphere Polar Vortex (NHPV).
