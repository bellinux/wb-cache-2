25|$|Canine {{glaucoma}} is {{an increase}} of pressure within the eye. It is a common condition in dogs. It {{can be caused by}} abnormal development of the drainage angle of the <b>eye,</b> <b>lens</b> luxation, uveitis, or cancer. Cocker Spaniels, Poodles, and Basset Hounds are predisposed.|$|E
25|$|Placing {{the flash}} {{away from the}} camera's optical axis ensures that {{the light from the}} flash hits the eye at an oblique angle. The light enters the eye in a {{direction}} away from the optical axis of the camera and is refocused by the <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> back along the same axis. Because of this the retina will not be visible to the camera and the eyes will appear natural.|$|E

25|$|Balasubramanian {{started his}} {{research}} activities in 1965 {{focusing on the}} structure and functions of proteins and polypeptides and worked on the thermodynamic analysis of their stability. The focus of his research changed in 1984/85 {{when he started to}} work on ocular science and concentrated on crystallins of <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> and their function as an agent in keeping the lens transparent. His research revealed how cataract is caused when crystallins are damaged photochemically, thereby leading to diminished lenticular transparency. He argued that the oxidative stress on the lens induces covalent chemical changes in the constituent molecules and these changes lead to cataract. He researched further on the subject to find out that, by supplementing antioxidants and cytoprotective substances, the progression of cataract can be slowed down. These findings are known to have introduced a prophylactic approach to addressing the issue of cataract, which is reported to be the causal factor for 47.9 percent of the blindness in the world. Further, he attempted to identify the cataractostatic agents and proposed the benefits of tea polyphenols, Ginko Biloba and Withania somnifera extracts. These substances contained antioxidants and cytoprotective compounds which slow down the progression of oxidative cataract and this was verified during experiments in animals.|$|E
25|$|A {{calculation}} of the MPE for ocular exposure {{takes into account the}} various ways light can act upon the eye. For example, deep-ultraviolet light causes accumulating damage, even at very low powers. Infrared light with a wavelength longer than about 1400nm is absorbed by the transparent parts of the eye before it reaches the retina, which means that the MPE for these wavelengths is higher than for visible light. In addition to the wavelength and exposure time, the MPE takes into account the spatial distribution of the light (from a laser or otherwise). Collimated laser beams of visible and near-infrared light are especially dangerous at relatively low powers because the lens focuses the light onto a tiny spot on the retina. Light sources with a smaller degree of spatial coherence than a well-collimated laser beam, such as high-power LEDs, lead to a distribution of the light over a larger area on the retina. For such sources, the MPE is higher than for collimated laser beams. In the MPE calculation, the worst-case scenario is assumed, in which the <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> focuses the light into the smallest possible spot size on the retina for the particular wavelength and the pupil is fully open. Although the MPE is specified as power or energy per unit surface, {{it is based on the}} power or energy that can pass through a fully open pupil (0.39cm2) for visible and near-infrared wavelengths. This is relevant for laser beams that have a cross-section smaller than 0.39cm2. The IEC-60825-1 and ANSIZ136.1 standards include methods of calculating MPEs.|$|E
25|$|Gap Junctions {{have been}} {{observed}} in various animal organs and tissues where cells contact each other. From the 1950s to 1970s they were detected in crayfish nerves, rat pancreas, liver, adrenal cortex, epididymis, duodenum, muscle, Daphnia hepatic caecum, Hydra muscle, monkey retina, rabbit cornea, fish blastoderm, frog embryos, rabbit ovary, re-aggregating cells, cockroach hemocyte capsules, rabbit skin, chick embryos, human islet of Langerhans, goldfish and hamster pressure sensing acoustico-vestibular receptors, lamprey and tunicate heart, rat seminiferous tubules, myometrium, <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> and cephalopod digestive epithelium. Since the 1970s gap junctions have continued {{to be found in}} nearly all animal cells that touch each other. By the 1990s new technology such as confocal microscopy allowed more rapid survey of large areas of tissue. Since the 1970s even tissues that were traditionally considered to possibly have isolated cells such as bone showed that the cells were still connected with gap junctions, however tenuously. Gap junctions appear to be in all animal organs and tissues and {{it will be interesting to}} find exceptions to this other than cells not normally in contact with neighboring cells. Adult skeletal muscle is a possible exception. It may be argued that if present in skeletal muscle, gap junctions might propagate contractions in an arbitrary way among cells making up the muscle. At least in some cases this may not be the case as shown in other muscle types that do have gap junctions. An indication of what results from reduction or absence of gap junctions may be indicated by analysis of cancers or the aging process.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{modes of}} cataractogenesis in the hypertensive state by using different hypertensive animal models, including fructose, cadmium chloride (CdCl 2), Nω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), and two-kidney, one clip (2 K 1 C) method. Methods: Male Sprague–Dawley albino rats (150 – 180  g) {{were divided into}} different groups, each group containing six animals. Hypertension was induced in animals via six weeks administration of fructose (10 % solution in drinking water), CdCl 2 (0. 5  mg/kg/day, i. p.), and l-NAME (20  mg/kg/day, p. o.) in their respective groups and NaCl (0. 9 % solution in drinking water) in the 2 K 1 C group. The Ramipril-treated group (2  mg/kg/day, orally) served as a standard group for the 2 K 1 C animal model. Blood pressure was measured biweekly using non-invasive blood pressure system. The biochemical parameters in serum and <b>eye</b> <b>lenses</b> were evaluated after six weeks of the experimental protocol. Results: Hypertensive animal models showed significant induction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure and modulation of oxidative stress through depletion of antioxidants, including glutathione peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and elevation of malondialdehyde in serum and <b>eye</b> <b>lenses.</b> A significant elevation of ionic contents (Na+ and Ca 2 +) and reduction of total protein and Ca 2 + ATPase activity in <b>eye</b> <b>lenses</b> were observed in all hypertensive animal models except l-NAME {{when compared with the}} normal group. The significant restoration of the antioxidants, Malondialdehyde (MDA) total protein, and ionic contents in the <b>eye</b> <b>lenses</b> concomitant with reduction of blood pressure were observed in the ramipril-treated group as compared to the 2 K 1 C animal model. The results indicate that the fructose, CdCl 2, and 2 K 1 C models showed pronounced cataractogenic effects in the rat <b>eye</b> <b>lenses.</b> Conclusion: Based on our findings, it can be concluded that systemic hypertension significantly increases the risk of cataract formation in the rat eyes via modulation of the antioxidant defense mechanism and electrolyte homeostasis...|$|R

40|$|Age {{determination}} of animals {{by measuring the}} weight of their <b>eye</b> <b>lenses</b> is a widely used method in wildlife biology. In general, it is recommended to prepare lenses immediately after trapping to avoid errors in the age estimation due to decomposition of lens tissue.

40|$|The {{refractive}} {{power of a}} lens is determined largely by its surface curvatures and the refractive index of its medium. These properties {{can also be used}} to control the sharpness of focus and hence the image quality. One of the most effective ways of doing this is with a gradient index. <b>Eye</b> <b>lenses</b> of all species, thus far, measured, are gradient index (GRIN) structures. The index gradation is one that increases from the periphery of the lens to its centre but the steepness of the gradient and the magnitudes of the refractive index vary so that the optics of the lens accords with visual demands. The structural proteins, the crystallins, which create the index gradient, also vary from species to species, in type and relative distribution across the tissue. The crystallin classes do not contribute equally to the refractive index, and this may be related to their structure and amino acid content. This article compares GRIN forms in <b>eye</b> <b>lenses</b> of varying species, the relevance of these forms to visual requirements, and the relationship between refractive index and the structural proteins. Consideration is given to the dynamics of a living lens, potential variations in the GRIN form with physiological changes and the possible link between discontinuities in the gradient and growth. Finally, the property of birefringence and the characteristic polarisation patterns seen in highly ordered crystals that have also been observed in specially prepared <b>eye</b> <b>lenses</b> are described and discussed...|$|R
50|$|Binocular eyepieces usually {{consist of}} three or more lens {{elements}} in two or more groups.

A reversed Kellner eyepiece was developed in 1975 and in it the field lens is a double concave/ double convex achromatic doublet and the <b>eye</b> <b>lens</b> is a double convex singlet.
