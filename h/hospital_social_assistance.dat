According to official estimates of productivity produced by Statistics Canada, labour productivity in the business sector of the health care (excluding <b>hospitals)</b> and <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> industry declined 0. 28 per cent per year between 1994 and 2003. Estimates of productivity produced by the CSLS, based on official Statistics Canada employment and real GDP figures, show that labour productivity in the health care and <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> industry declined by 0. 69 per cent per year between 1987 and 2006. It is widely recognized that official output and productivity figures may seriously underestimate the true contribution of the health care sector to real output, and more importantly to the economic well-being of Canadians. Alternative approaches show that price indices for health care output may be overestimated and, therefore, quality improvements may not be accurately captured by estimates of real health care output.

In this article, the duration of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> periods are investigated using Norwegian administrative data covering the years 1992 – 2002. Two types of analysis were performed. First, discrete time–event history analysis was used to investigate the duration of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> and the likelihood of re-entries among those who succeed in exiting <b>social</b> <b>assistance.</b> Second, panel data methods were used to study {{the amount of money that}} individuals receive in <b>social</b> <b>assistance.</b> The results show that most periods of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> are relatively short. However, there is variation, including some long-term periods, and a large proportion of those who exit <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> later re-enter.

There is no difference between immigrants and people born in Norway with regard to the likelihood of re-entering. The study also shows that there are many who receive universal benefits in addition to <b>social</b> <b>assistance.</b> Based on such findings, we question the common understanding of the <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> system as a secondary system and safety net for those who fall outside the traditional universal benefit system, and argue that more attention should be paid to the importance of institutional factors than to discourse on dependency...|$|R

Which factors are central to exits with different subsequent income patterns? How do these explain the different situations of recipients prior to termination? We focus particularly on income maintenance prior to spells of social assis-tance. We use event history data on monthly <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> take-up covering the total adult Swedish population for the years 2002 – 2004.

40|$|This policy brief discusses: <b>Social</b> <b>assistance</b> is {{critical}} to counter the insecurity and vulnerability experienced by chronically poor people. Evidence shows {{that as well as}} preventing people from sliding into poverty, <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> supports human development, helps people to access opportunities to exit poverty, and interrupts the intergenerational transmission of poverty. An obstacle to progress on <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> involves arguments around the ‘dependency syndrome’ – concerns about recipients becoming permanently dependent on ‘handouts’ and losing any inclination to improve their circumstances as a result of it. An associated assumption is that if poor people are given <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> they will inevitably ‘waste’ it on negative purchases (e. g. alcohol), as opposed to using it constructively. Concerns around the propensity for <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> to induce ‘dependency’ in Southern countries are largely based on anecdotal evidence, rather than empirical realities. Empirical research shows that <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> supports savings, human capital development, investment, and enterprise; improves labour-market participation and reduces dependence on adverse contractual employment arrangements; and far from crowding out informal systems of support, it can help improve social networks and support private (informal) forms of protection Evidence from the global South overwhelmingly finds that <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> is affordable, that recipients make rational choices to improve their circumstances, and that <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> reduces dependency in the long-term. In other words, <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> is an important response to chronic poverty. Children overall tend to be the main beneficiaries of social transfers – not just child benefit...|$|R

Different countries have implemented different provisions regarding the amount of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> benefits, the eligibility criteria, as well as the types of cash and in-kind benefits provided as part of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> schemes. These differences have been based on the conditions and instruments each country has used to target the marginalized groups. The development of social protection schemes in Kosovo has started in the beginning of 21 st century with support and intervention of international organizations led by their priorities and interests. In the beginning, when UNMIK came in 1999 the main focus of the scheme was emergency relief; two years after the focus shifted to a social safety net where UNMIK was tasked with development of new <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> scheme.

The Law of the Republic of Indonesia Number 11 of 2009 and Regulation of the Ministry of Social of the Republic of Indonesia Number 82 of 2006 set out and guide the <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> delivery to the community. However, most of the literature addressing <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> programmes, following a disaster in Indonesia, is from the government?s perspective, the legislation outlook and the social assistants? point of view. Little is known about the benefit and practice of the <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> programmes from the perspectives of the affected community. Therefore, the current study sought to address this gap by exploring the experiences of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> within the affected community following a disaster. With this knowledge, the government, NGOs, private sectors and other parties would gain insights, inputs and recommendations from the affected community, to whom the programmes were delivered, so that <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> programmes following a disaster may be made more effective. A qualitative study was conducted in Kinahrejo hamlet, the most affected community from the 2010 Mount Merapi eruption. Data was analysed using qualitative descriptive methodology via open-ended and close-ended questions with 10 participants. The study explored whether the lived experiences of the Kinahrejo community was congruent with Indonesian regulation regarding <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> programmes. This study has contributed to the field of research on <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> programmes following a disaster by providing findings on the importance of the mentioned programmes toward the affected community from the community?s experiences and perspectives...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between income inequality and <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> caseload {{within the context of}} London, Ontario from 1993 to 2013. Gini coefficients, <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> caseload, and control variable data have been gathered and calculated using a multiple linear regression statistical analysis and academic investigation. The findings suggest that there is a 68 percent correlation between the regression model and the independent variable of <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> caseload, with unemployment being the strongest explanatory variable. A negative relationship between income inequality and <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> caseload variables was found, but important endogenous variables, such as policy interventions and macroeconomic cycles, have {{played an important role in}} altering this relationship.

The academic research also demonstrated that most <b>social</b> <b>assistance</b> recipients have income levels that are below the poverty line...|$|R
