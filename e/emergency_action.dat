In this part, the cases of several subsets of contingencies with different unstable modes are dealt with. Some preventive actions benefiting a subset of contingencies may go against the stability of others; thus coordination among the optimal schemes for individual subsets is necessary. The coordination is achieved by properly replacing preventive <b>actions</b> with <b>emergency</b> <b>actions</b> for some individual subsets. It is formulated as a classical model of economic dispatch with additional generating costs due to the <b>emergency</b> <b>actions.</b> Such an optimal algorithm is proposed based on the algorithm in the Part-I and verified by simulations on a Chinese power system. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

25|$|This {{point of}} view argues that {{management}} (and to some extent, local government) underinvested in safety, which allowed for a dangerous working environment to develop.

Other factors identified by government inquiries included undersized safety devices and the dependence on manual operations. Specific plant management deficiencies that were identified include the lack of skilled operators, reduction of safety management, insufficient maintenance, and inadequate <b>emergency</b> <b>action</b> plans.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Based on the {{stability}} margin {{provided by the}} EEAC, the unstable contingencies can be classified into sets according to their unstable modes. This two-part paper develops a globally optimal algorithm for transient stability control to coordinate preventive <b>actions</b> and <b>emergency</b> <b>actions.</b> In the first part, an algorithm is proposed {{for a set of}} contingencies having identical unstable modes. Instead of iterations between discrete <b>emergency</b> <b>actions</b> and continuous preventive actions, the algorithm straightforwardly searches for a globally optimal solution. The procedure includes assessing a set of insufficient emergency schemes identified by the EEAC; calculating the related preventive actions needed for stabilizing the system; and selecting the scheme with the minimum overall costs. Simulations on a Chinese power system highlight its excellent performance. The positive results obtained are explained by analogizing settlements for 0 - 1 knapsack problems using the multi-points greedy algorithm...|$|R

40|$|During an {{emergency}} {{response to an}} accident or disaster, <b>emergency</b> response <b>actions</b> often need to use various emergency resources. The use of resources {{plays an important role}} in the successful implementation of emergency response, but there may be conflicts in the use of resources for <b>emergency</b> <b>actions.</b> According to the emergency response in case of an oil fire, two types of emergency response models with dynamic structure are established by using Resource-Oriented Timed Colored Hybrid Petri-Net (RO-TCHPN). Type 1 model does not establish a special conflict avoidance mechanism for <b>emergency</b> <b>actions,</b> while Type 2 model uses a queuing method to avoid possible conflicts in the use of limited resources by multiple actions. In this paper, the two types of models are simulated and analyzed, including (1) emergency response process simulation, which analyzes and determines the time and the conditions of the potential conflicts occurring; and (2) comparison analysis, analyzing the improvement of the Type 2 model as compared with the Type 1 model. Increasing emergency resources to reduce or avoid conflicts and whether all the fire-trucks should be fully filled at the beginning of {{an emergency}} response, are also discussed based on the simulation. </p...|$|R
