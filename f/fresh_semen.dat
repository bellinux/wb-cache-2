40|$|Abstract: Neosporosis {{is caused}} by the {{protozoan}} parasite, Neospora caninum which is major cause of fatal disease and abortion in cattle in Iran and in many countries. The economic impacts of neosporosis are lost milk, meat and abortions in cattle. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to evaluate the presence of N. caninum DNA in <b>fresh</b> and frozen <b>semen</b> samples of Iranian bulls that were used for artificial insemination using PCR method. In this study 175 fresh and frozen bull’s semen specimens were collected from Iranian animal husbandries and two artificial insemination centers and genomic DNA was extracted. For detection of pNC- 5 gene of N. caninum were amplified by oligonucleotide primers using PCR technique and 1 % agarose gel electrophoresis used for visualization of amplified PCR products. The results of this study showed that 30 of 175 (17. 14 %) semen samples in Iranian bulls were infected with N. caninum and the protozoan DNA was detected in 17 (9. 71 %) and 13 (7. 43 %) of <b>fresh</b> and frozen <b>semen</b> specimens, respectively. The findings of present study demonstrated high presence of N. caninum infection (P< 0. 05) and showed that <b>fresh</b> and frozen <b>semen</b> samples of bulls that were used for artificial insemination play an important role in the spread of bovine neosporosis in Iran. These results indicated PCR technique is useful for fast detection of this protozoan in semen specimens.

5000|$|Intracervical {{insemination}} (ICI) involves {{injection of}} unwashed or raw semen into the cervix with a needleless syringe. Sperm supplied by a sperm bank will be frozen {{and must be}} allowed to thaw before insemination. The sealed end of the straw itself must be cut off and the open end of the straw is usually fixed straight on to the tip of the syringe, allowing the contents to be drawn into the syringe.

40|$|Aim: The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of species, breed and age on bacterial load in <b>fresh</b> and frozen <b>semen</b> of Cattle and Buffalo bull. Materials and Methods: Present study covered 56 cow and 10 buffalo bulls stationed at Central Semen Station Anjora, Durg (Chhattisgarh). Impact of breeds on bacterial load in semen was assessed using six breeds of cattle viz. Sahiwal, Gir, Red Sindhi, Tharparkar, Jersey and Holstein Friesian (HF) cross. Cow bulls were categorized into four different groups based on their age (6 years) to study variation among age groups. Bacterial load was measured in <b>fresh</b> and frozen <b>semen</b> samples from these bulls using the standard plate count (SPC) method and count was expressed as colony forming unit (CFU) per ml of semen. Results: Higher bacterial load was reported in fresh (2. 36 × 104 ± 1943 CFU/ml) and frozen (1. 00 × 10 ± 90 CFU/ml) semen of cow bulls as compared to buffalo bulls (1. 95 × 104 ± 2882 and 7. 75 × 102 ± 160 CFU/ml in <b>fresh</b> and frozen <b>semen,</b> respectively). Jersey bull showed significantly higher bacterial count (p < 0. 05) both in fresh (4. 07 × 104 ± 13927 CFU/ ml) and frozen (1. 92 × 103 ± 178 CFU/ml) semen followed by HF cross, Sahiwal, Gir, Red Sindhi and Tharparkar bull. Bulls aged < 4 years and more than 6 years yielded increased bacterial load in their semen. Although a minor variation was reported between species and among age groups, no significant differences were measured.

Defesa: Palotina, 12 / 02 / 2016 Inclui referências : f. 9 - 13; 41 - 44 Resumo: Objetivando avaliar os parâmetros reprodutivos e a variabilidade genética de proles de jundiá (Rhamdia quelen) provenientes de diferentes sistemas reprodutivos, conduziu-se um experimento em esquema fatorial 2 x 2, onde os fatores experimentais foram o emprego do sêmen fresco e criopreservado, e o acasalamento {{individual}} e por pool de gametas na fertilização artificial, além do acasalamento natural, totalizando cinco tratamentos. Para cada fator (sêmen fresco e sêmen criopreservado) e no acasalamento natural, foram utilizados seis jundiás (3 ? e 3 ?). Não foram observadas diferenças (P> 0, 05) nas fecundidades absoluta e relativa das fêmeas, taxas de fertilização e eclosão dos ovos. Para percentual de larvas normais, o uso de sêmen fresco acarretou em maior (P 0. 05) {{were detected}} for absolute and relative fertility of females, fertilization and egg hatching rates. The use of <b>fresh</b> <b>semen</b> resulted in higher (P < 0. 01) percentage of normal larvae {{in comparison with}} the use of cryopreserved semen and natural spawning. As for the genetic variability of the offspring, using <b>fresh</b> <b>semen</b> for mating by pool resulted in a higher effective number of alleles and higher expected heterozygosity. Offspring from natural spawning showed the highest observed heterozygosity and the lowest inbreeding coefficient. The highest inbreeding coefficient was found in the offspring of the system using <b>fresh</b> <b>semen</b> and individual mating, followed by the offspring using <b>fresh</b> <b>semen</b> and mating by pool and offspring using cryopreserved semen. Regarding the parental contribution of males, there was reproductive dominance of a male in the system using <b>fresh</b> <b>semen,</b> and in systems using cryopreserved semen and natural mating, there was dominance of two males. It can be concluded that the use of mating by pool of gametes and natural spawning result in greater genetic variability of offspring, and the use of cryopreserved semen has no influence on the genetic variability of offspring, but reduces the percentage of normal larvae.

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{studied the}} {{influence}} of five and six generations of selection for duration of fer-tility of frozen-thawed fowl semen on spermatozoa and seminal plasma cholesterol and phos-pholipid levels, their ratios, and their relationships with fertility of frozen-thawed and <b>fresh</b> <b>semen.</b> Males from the selected and control line were used. Cholesterol and phospholipid levels were deter-mined in 2 trials for spermatozoa and in a single trial for seminal plasma per generation. The selected line had significantly (P. 05). The heritability estimates of spermatozoa cholesterol and phospholipid levels ranged from zero to. 66 and zero to. 81, respectively. The phenotypic correlations of spermatozoa and seminal plasma cholesterol with fertility of frozen-thawed semen were negative as were the phenotypic correlations of seminal plasma choles-terol with fertility of <b>fresh</b> <b>semen...</b>|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the ACP- 102 c extender in the cryopreservation of ram semen compared to tris-glucose-egg yolk (TRIS) extender and <b>fresh</b> <b>semen.</b> Forty-eight ejaculates were collected from four rams and two aliquots per ejaculate were taken for dilution and cryopreservation in ACP- 102 c or TRIS and a third aliquot used for the <b>fresh</b> <b>semen</b> analysis. Either the <b>fresh</b> <b>semen</b> and cryopreserved in both extenders were evaluated for viability, integrity of plasma and acrosomal membrane, hypoosmotic swelling test, DNA fragmentation and sperm motility. The extenders did not differ for sperm viability, acrosome and plasma membrane integrity, DNA fragmentation and quantitative and qualitative parameters of sperm velocity after thawing, but differed in hypoosmotic swelling test, total and progressive motility and lateral extent of the head as well as in all motility parameters evaluated (except linearity and straightness) after two hours of incubation at 37 oC. There was variability among rams in total and progressive motility of semen cryopreserved in ACP- 102 c after thawing. The ACP- 102 c extender showed less protection in the cryopreservation of ram sperm when compared to TRIS, but the improvement in its formulation and freezing protocols may make it an alternative to freezing ram semen...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Differences in {{conception}} rate to first service between artificial inseminations (AI) car-ried out by commercial AI operators (CAI) or do-it-yourself operators (DIY), between natural ser-vice (NAT) and AI, between different AI sires, and between <b>fresh</b> and frozen-thawed <b>semen,</b> on Irish commercial dairy farms, were studied using logistic regression. The study comprised 12 933 poten-tial first inseminations from 77 spring-calving dairy herds. The data were recorded during 1999 and 2000. Amongst the total, 4 394 cows had repeated records {{across the two}} years. Adjustment vari-ables included: herd, year, parity, calving period, calving to service interval, herd size, proportion of North American Holstein-Friesian genes, peak milk yield, <b>semen</b> <b>fresh</b> or frozen-thawed status, AI sire and a cow history variable {{to account for the}} correlation structure that may exist between perfor-mance records of cows present in both years of the study. Interactions of interest were tested but were non-significant. No significant association was observed between the category of AI operator and the likelihood of {{conception rate}} to first service (PREG 1). The variation in PREG 1 observed within the category of operator (CAI and DIY) was investigated using the Levene test for homoge-neity of variance. There was no difference between the level of variation observed within CAI and DIY operators. There were significant differences in the likelihood of PREG 1 between different A...|$|R
40|$|A {{sublethal}} environmental stress, high-hydrostatic pressure (HHP) {{was reported}} to significantly improve the motility, viability and fertility parameters of frozen bull and boar semen. However, the mechanism of how HHP treatment improves survival rates at sperm cryopreservation remains unclear. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of HHP treatment of <b>fresh</b> boar <b>semen</b> on the protein profile of boar sperm before and after freezing. <b>Fresh,</b> extended <b>semen</b> of eight boars was split, one part was treated with 200, 300 or 400 bar for 90 min using a custom made pressuring device before the start of the semen freezing procedure, and the other part was prepared without HHP treatment. After thawing, samples were checked for motility. The effect of HHP treatment on the post-thaw motility of frozen semen was significant (P = 0. 02). Post-thaw motility of each treatment groups increased compared to control (46 % vs. 52 %, 56 % and 56 %; control vs. 200 bar, 300 bar and 400 bar treatments). Samples for protein analysis were collected from the 300 bar treatment group before HHP treatment at room temperature (25 +/- 3 degrees C, at 5 degrees C of the cooling process and after thawing with or without HHP treatment. The sperm were lysed using a urea-pyranoside-dithiothreitol buffer to extract their proteins for protein analysis. Approximately 800 mu g total proteins were assayed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and stained with colloidal Coomassie blue. The levels of 125 protein spots were quantified. The results revealed that the levels of 7 protein spots differed significantly among treatments. The identities of various protein constituents were identified by mass spectrometry and database searching. Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex core protein 1, perilipin, and carbohydrate-binding protein AWN precursor were identified as HHP response proteins being significantly higher in HHP-treated samples. Testis-specific glyceraldehyde 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase, outer dense fiber of sperm tails 2 isoform 10, cytosolic 5 '-nucleotidase 1 B, and quinone oxidoreductase represented the cooling and freezing related proteins. The differing levels of these identified proteins could be valuable for further exploring the protective mechanism of the HHP treatment in frozen-thawed porcine sperm. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|A {{wide range}} of extenders are {{available}} for storing fowl semen. Three of them (the Lake extender, the EK extender described by Łukaszewicz, and an extender described by Tselutin et al.) were tested for their suitability to store semen of 4 fowl breeds: Green-Legged Partridge, Black Minorca, White Crested Black Polish, and Italian Partridge. Changes in spermatozoa viability and morphology were evaluated in <b>fresh</b> neat <b>semen</b> and in semen diluted 1 : 4 and stored for 3, 6, and 24 h at 4 °C. During the time of semen storage, {{a decrease in the}} number of live, morphologically normal spermatozoa and an increase in dead spermatozoa and spermatozoa with bent necks were observed. The EK extender was found to be the most suitable regardless of the fowl breed because the number of live spermatozoa did not decrease as much as in semen diluted with the other extenders. The Lake extender had the least beneficial effect on stored sperm morphology in every breed. Key words: sperm quality, in vitro storage, semen extender, sperm morpholog...|$|R
