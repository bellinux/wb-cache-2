5|$|Barris {{remained}} {{heavily involved}} in production {{in an attempt to}} portray the film <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> To accommodate the $30 million budget, Clooney convinced Drew Barrymore and Julia Roberts to lower their salaries. The film was released to respectful reviews from critics and was modestly successful at the box office. Rockwell, in particular, was praised for his acting and won the Silver Bear for Best Actor at the 2003 Berlin International Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|From the start, {{the film}} moves {{continuously}} between Barton's subjective {{view of the}} world and one which is objective. After the opening credits roll, the camera pans down to Barton, watching the end of his play. Soon we see the audience <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> cheering wildly for him. As he walks forward, he enters the shot and the viewer is returned to an objective point of view. This blurring of the subjective and objective returns in the final scene.|$|E

5|$|The album {{prominently}} features flute, acoustic {{and electric}} guitars and Hammond organ, {{which had been}} used previously, but the instrumentation includes harpsichord, xylophone, timpani, violin, lute, trumpet, saxophone, and a string section—all uncommon in the band's earlier blues-inspired rock. Anderson later said that the lyrics were partly derived from experiences his own childhood, though the overall theme was showing Bostock's attempt {{to make sense of}} life <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b>|$|E
5|$|Later, Mulder discovers Harold {{in a room}} {{accessible}} {{from the}} bowling alley. The walls of the room are covered with score sheets, {{including those of the}} victims. Mulder realizes that Harold met each of the murdered women at the bowling alley. Harold lapses into a strange seizure, and <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> sees Angie's ghost standing behind Mulder. He rushes {{out of the room and}} makes his way to the bowling alley, where Angie lies dead from a heart attack. Mulder tells Scully that every person who saw the apparitions was about to die, implying that Harold may be next. Scully, who also saw a victim's ghost, is struck by the implication.|$|E
5|$|The main {{sources for}} {{knowledge}} of Wilfrid are the medieval Vita Sancti Wilfrithi, written by Stephen of Ripon soon after Wilfrid's death, and {{the works of}} the medieval historian Bede, who knew Wilfrid during the bishop's lifetime. Stephen's Vita is a hagiography, intended to show Wilfrid as a saintly man, and to buttress claims that he was a saint. The Vita is selective in its coverage, and gives short shrift to Wilfrid's activities outside of Northumbria. Two-thirds of the work deals with Wilfrid's attempts to return to Northumbria, and is a defence and vindication of his Northumbrian career. Stephen's work is flattering and highly favourable to Wilfrid, making its use as a source problematic; despite its shortcomings however, the Vita is the main source of information on Wilfrid's life. It views the events in Northumbria in the light of Wilfrid's reputation and <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> and is highly partisan. Another concern is that hagiographies were usually full of conventional material, often repeated from earlier saints' lives, {{as was the case with}} Stephen's work. It appears that the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi was not well known in the Middle Ages, as only two manuscripts of the work survive.|$|E
60|$|The look of uneasy {{expectation}} reappeared {{in the eye}} of Mr. Bishopriggs. It was a question--and {{a serious}} question, <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view--whether any suspicion of theft was attached to the disappearance of the letter.|$|R

5|$|The {{fruit of}} Lindwall's fitness regime ripened {{in the early}} Shield matches of the 1958–59 season and he {{sent a message to}} the {{selectors}} when England arrived in Brisbane for a tour match before the First Test. Lindwall took 5/57 in the first innings, dismissing Watson, Milton, Colin Cowdrey, Trevor Bailey and Jim Laker. He removed both openers for seven in the second innings before rain curtailed the match, leaving Lindwall with match figures of 7/73. Unfortunately <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> none of the selection committee attended the match. Lindwall was overlooked as the selectors persisted with the winning combination that toured South Africa. His prospects of a recall appeared even more remote after Australia won both of the first two Tests, with Davidson and Meckiff skittling England for 87 in the second innings of the Second Test, taking nine wickets each for the match. Meckiff was injured during the Third Test, leaving him in doubt for the Fourth Test. In the meantime, Lindwall had a Shield match away against South Australia to make a final claim for a recall. The hosts batted first in stifling heat around 42 degrees on a batting pitch, and Lindwall delivered 41 eight-ball overs to take 7/92. Lindwall received a standing ovation for his performances in unfavourable conditions and was greeted by Bradman, the chairman of selectors. Lindwall avoided Bradman's inquiries as to whether he had any injury worries, fearing it would hinder his chances of selection.|$|E

25|$|In The Impostors, one {{character}} {{speaks in a}} foreign language, while another character hides under the bed. Although the hidden character cannot understand what is being spoken, he can read the subtitles.

25|$|In 2009, Dustin Diamond {{published}} an inside {{story of the}} show's cast and crew <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> entitled Behind the Bell. The book paints an unflattering portrait of many of Diamond's colleagues and their alleged backstage behavior. Some of Diamond's claims have been refuted by colleagues and questioned by critics. Diamond also alleges {{in the book that}} he had sex with 2,000 women, one of them being NBC's Vice President of children's programming, Linda Mancuso, who was 18 years his senior. Diamond later disclaimed responsibility for much of the book's content, blaming his ghostwriter for fabricating salacious stories.|$|E

About twenty steps still remained between him and the gate, when he heard a dispute. It was a difference concerning twopence between the persons with the waggon and the man at the toll-bar.|$|R
500|$|Clooney {{was adamant}} that Barris become heavily {{involved}} during production {{in an attempt}} to portray the film <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> Barris was so enthusiastic with Clooney's work on the film that he began writing Bad Grass Never Dies (...) , the sequel to Confessions; Miramax also owns the film rights to Bad Grass. Barris filmed cameo appearances of himself during the shoot in Canada and taped a voice-over in Clooney's house.|$|E
500|$|According to Riordan, he had {{the idea}} {{to make a new}} series in the {{universe}} of Percy Jackson after he wrote Percy Jackson's Greek Gods, when he discovered two myths about Zeus punishing Apollo, turning him into a mortal. Riordan liked the concept and decided to [...] "subject poor Apollo to that punishment for a third time and write a series <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> as a newly outcast 16-year-old mortal". However, he promised that many of the characters from Percy Jackson & the Olympians and The Heroes of Olympus would return in the new series. Because Apollo is the god of poetry, the name of each chapter would be a [...] "bad haiku".|$|E
500|$|On 10 February 1971, Bright Tunes {{filed suit}} against Harrison and {{associated}} organisations (including Harrisongs, Apple Records and BMI), alleging copyright infringement of the late Ronnie Mack's song [...] "He's So Fine". In I Me Mine, Harrison admits to having thought [...] "Why didn't I realise?" [...] when others started pointing out the similarity between the two songs; by June that year, country singer Jody Miller had released a cover of [...] "He's So Fine" [...] incorporating Harrison's [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] slide-guitar riffs, thus [...] "really putting the screws in" [...] <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> On Harrison's behalf, manager Allen Klein entered into negotiations with Bright Tunes to resolve the issue, by offering to buy the financially ailing publisher's entire catalogue, but no settlement could be reached before the company was forced into receivership.|$|E

During the writing process, Polanski and Tynan acted out their scenes in a Belgravia, London apartment, with Tynan as Duncan and Polanski as Macbeth. As with the 1948 film version of Hamlet, the soliloquies are presented naturalistically as voiceover narration.|$|R

500|$|In {{the book}} The Shooting Scripts, Russell T Davies {{claims that he}} had {{originally}} set out to write this episode from Adam's perspective, watching the adventure unfolding <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> (exactly as Rose did in [...] "Rose") and seeing both the Doctor and Rose as enigmatic, frightening characters. He even gave this outline a working title: [...] "Adam". Another working title for this story was [...] "The Companion Who Couldn't". According to Davies, the concept of [...] "The Long Game" [...] was originally written in the early 1980s and submitted to the Doctor Who production office. Whether it was ever read by the production team of the time is unclear, as Davies received a rejection from the BBC Script Unit, who advised him to write more realistic television about [...] "a man and his mortgage" [...] instead. Davies reworked the story for the new series.|$|E
500|$|Many {{contemporary}} {{books about}} the 1948 War were published at this time: John and David Kimche, The {{two sides of the}} hill (1960) (the more reliable); Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins, O Jerusalem (1972) (the best known internationally) and Dan Kurzman, Genesis, 1948 (1970) (the only one that got reviews in the Israeli press). With this political writing, historical research on Latrun tends to concentrate on the 1980s with the work of Arié Itzhaki, [...] "Latrun" [...] (in 2 volumes). It gives the exact number of victims, but, at the contrary of Israel Beer (meanwhile caught as spying for USSR), it depicts the battle as [...] "The hardest in the history of Tsahal", and it puts the responsibility of the defeat on Ben-Gurion, who panicked about Jerusalem, and tactical errors on the brigade commanders and not on the immigrants who received (<b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view)</b> a sufficient training.|$|E
500|$|Mercedes {{maintained}} {{they had}} achieved what {{the car was}} capable of with fourth and fifth-place finishes for Schumacher and Rosberg respectively.

Alonso was disappointed with the team's performance in what Ferrari identified as their 800th start, yet he looked forward to upgrades in the following races. James Key, the technical director of BMW Sauber, was happy with the double finish and the one point the team picked up, courtesy of Kobayashi. Despite setting the race's fastest lap, Petrov was disappointed to not finish in a points-scoring position. He said it was bad luck but stated there were many positives he could take from the event and hoped that he could achieve a stronger result in Canada.|$|E
