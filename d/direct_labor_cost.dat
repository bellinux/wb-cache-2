This is evidenced by the deviations of the direct labor costs during 2004, 2005 and 2006. These deviations occur because of several factors including: the determination of the difference is quite high wage rates than the regional minimum wage (UMR), direct labor is not doing the job correctly, the lack of oversight that led to the existence of idle time.

Data analysis indicates {{a need for}} significant process improvements or radical changes to depot processes. The Integrated Maintenance Concept (IMC) will consolidate organizational and depot level maintenance at fleet locations. IMC offers several advantages over traditional depot maintenance methods. Using regression analysis, the direct costs of SDLMs conducted at the Pensacola Naval Aviation Depot from 1987 to 1995 were used to estimate direct costs of depot maintenance based on: aircraft age, the projected level of depot maintenance, and employment (operational versus training). Within {{the scope of this}} research, a weak correlation existed between the <b>direct</b> <b>labor</b> <b>costs</b> and aircraft age and employment as explanatory variables direct material costs showed a higher correlation: for total direct costs, these two variables explained 34. 4 percent of the variation.

It directly or indirectly suppresses the subsequent production cost to lead into the expected profit. A device to control production cost considers variance analysis. Variant analysis refers to the control of production cost by comparing the budgeted cost and realized cost in certain period. Considering this problem, the author takes the title of “Production Cost Control Analysis in the Shanghai Bean Company “Suling Mas Group” in Tulungagung. This research type concerns with case study. The objective of research will be to examine whether production cost expended by Tulungagung Shanghai Bean Company “Suling Mas Group” seems controlled or uncontrolled. Data analysis technique includes: first, raw material cost variance; second, <b>direct</b> <b>labor</b> <b>cost</b> variance; third, plant overhead cost; fourth, plant overhead cost tariff determination; and fifth, plant overhead cost variance. Results of research indicate that the control of raw material cost and <b>direct</b> <b>labor</b> <b>cost</b> has been succeed meaning that the advantaging variance from raw material cost and <b>direct</b> <b>labor</b> <b>cost</b> reaches 89, 850, 000 rupiahs and 37, 134, 000 rupiahs.
