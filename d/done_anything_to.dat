5|$|Gilly and Steph {{take a walk}} {{round the}} village on bonfire night where she finally admits she's scared of dying, they have a heart to heart {{conversation}} where she realises she's it is how {{she is going to}} die that scares her. When the pair see restaurant Il Gnosh on fire, Gilly rings for help whilst Steph runs into the burning building to save Amy Barnes (Ashley Slanina-Davies) and her children. Gilly stands on a ladder outside and begs her to come out, however she tells him she's ready to die and walks back into the flames. Gilly deals with his grief by becoming angry that Steph has 'left' him. After Rhys tries to comfort him, Gilly goes into Steph's room and trashes it after seeing that she has still kept her photo of her and Max Cunningham (Matt Littler) on their wedding day, placed on a table. Gilly argues with Steph's family as they blame him for not saving her and disagree on the funeral arrangements. Frankie then tells him that Steph had never loved him and that Max would have <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> save Steph from the fire, making him further deeply upset and angry. He starts drinking heavily, causing trouble on many occasions.|$|E
25|$|On July 17, 2009, NASA {{released}} low-resolution {{engineering test}} {{photos of the}} Apollo 11, Apollo 14, Apollo 15, Apollo 16 and Apollo 17 landing sites that have been photographed by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter {{as part of the}} process of starting its primary mission. The photos show the descent stage of the landers from each mission on the Moon’s surface. The photo of the Apollo 14 landing site also shows tracks made by an astronaut between a science experiment (ALSEP) and the lander. Photos of the Apollo 12 landing site were released by NASA on September 3, 2009. The Intrepid lander descent stage, experiment package (ALSEP), Surveyor 3 spacecraft, and astronaut footpaths are all visible. While the LRO images have been enjoyed by the scientific community as a whole, they have not <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> convince conspiracists that the landings happened.|$|E
25|$|The British {{troops were}} horrified and enraged. Upon {{learning}} of the massacre, the infuriated British garrison engaged in a surge of violence against the local population of Cawnpore, including looting and burning of houses, with the justification {{that none of the}} local noncombatants had <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> stop the massacre. Brigadier General Neill, who took the command at Cawnpore, immediately began a program of swift and vicious drumhead military justice (culminating in summary execution) for any sepoy rebel captured from the city who was unable to prove he was not involved in the massacre. Rebels confessing to or believed {{to be involved in the}} massacre were forced to lick the floor of the Bibighar compound, after it had been wetted with water by low caste people, while being whipped. The sepoys were then religiously disgraced by being forced to eat (or force fed) beef (if Hindu) or pork (if Muslim). The Muslim sepoys were sewn into pig skins before being hanged, and low-caste Hindu street sweepers were employed to execute the high-caste Brahmin rebels to add additional religious disgrace to their punishment.|$|E

500|$|Littell said {{he wanted}} to focus on the {{thinking}} of an executioner and of origins of state murder, showing how we can take decisions that lead, or not, to a genocide. Littell claims he set out creating the character Max Aue by imagining what he would have done and how he would have behaved if he had been born into Nazi Germany. One childhood event that kept Littell interested in the question of being a killer was the Vietnam War. According to him, his childhood terror was that he would be drafted, sent to Vietnam [...] "and made to kill women and children who hadn't <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> me." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} day, {{the plaintiffs}} presented their second argument, namely that the measles vaccine had caused intestinal damage. Their witness {{that day was}} gastroenterologist Arthur Krigsman, who testified that his opinion in the case depended on whether measles virus had really been detected in the intestinal tissue of Michelle Cedillo and other children with autism by the Unigenetics lab, using {{a study conducted by}} him, Dr. Hepner, Steve Walker, and Jeff Segal as evidence that the Unigenetics lab's results were reliable. This study, however, was still in its preliminary stages {{at the time of the}} trial, and had only been presented as a poster at the International Meeting for Autism Research the year before, and Walker himself warned that [...] "We haven't <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate that the measles virus is causing autism or even causing bowel disease." ...|$|E
500|$|The court {{considered}} that Thomas had been regularly informed by {{all those who}} had interrogated him that {{the degree to which}} he cooperated would determine what happened to him, and that given their position as authority figures, Thomas would have readily perceived that they had the ability to change his situation; indeed, none of the interviewers had <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> dispel the idea that {{they would be able to}} help Thomas. The court also pointed out that even if actions such as showing Thomas photographs of his family and letters from them could not be said to be deliberately improper, as the trial judge seemed to indicate would be necessary to characterise them as inducements, there was no way that they could be interpreted by someone in Thomas' position, other than as indications that if he cooperated he would be reunited with his family. Particularly, after Thomas expressed happiness at seeing the photographs, one of the interviewers took them away, saying [...] " [...] might give you another look at that later", comments which were [...] "calculated, if not intended, to remind the applicant that he was dependent on his captors and interviewers for favours." ...|$|E
500|$|There were officially ten {{suspects}} for the murder, {{though the}} ten were {{not known to}} viewers or cast members, who speculated about {{the identity of the}} killer. On Christmas Eve, storylines showed Archie evicting his wife Peggy, daughters Ronnie and Roxy, Peggy's son Phil and Phil's son Ben (Charlie Jones) from their home, The Queen Victoria public house, after he became the landlord. Ronnie had a further motive as Archie had caused her to suffer a miscarriage and she blamed him for the death of her daughter Danielle Jones (Lauren Crace) earlier in 2009. Peggy discovered that Archie had paid her daughter Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook) to skip bail, thus plunging the Mitchells into debt, and Sam returned on Christmas Day to discover she had been manipulated. Phil was also a suspect after failing to kill Archie on Peggy's request earlier in 2009. Simons explained that the killer was likely to be the most unsuspecting person, and stated that Roxy was [...] "pretty much the only non-suspect," [...] but said she felt the character would not {{go so far as to}} kill her father, even though she had seen his true colours. Woodyatt said his character, Ian Beale, would have <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> stop his wife Jane (Laurie Brett) from finding out that he had sex with Janine, so it would be plausible if it turned out that Ian had killed Archie. Archie had a laptop recording of Ian and Janine together that he had threatened to give to Jane. Janine, who was engaged to Archie, also had a motive as Archie had been using her to gain ownership of The Queen Victoria and threw her out on Christmas Day. She was seen holding a knife before Archie was killed.|$|E

2500|$|When {{considering}} setting Gutiérrez's play, Verdi {{turned to}} work with Cammarano, [...] "the born operatic poet" [...] (according to Budden). Their correspondence began as early as January 1850, well before Verdi had <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> develop a libretto with Piave for what later became Rigoletto in Venice. At this time, {{it was also the}} first since Oberto that the composer was beginning to prepare an opera with a librettist but without a commission of any kind from an opera house. In his first letter to Cammarano, Verdi proposed El Trovador as the subject with [...] "two feminine roles.

[...] He said he had disappointed sponsors, managers and directeurs sportifs, even though they continued to show confidence in him. [...] "I had become schizophrenic," [...] he said. Without psychiatric help, he would [...] "have followed the same path as Pantani", the Italian rider found dead on a hotel floor. After 450,000 French francs a month at Cofidis, he earned 220,000 at Lampre in 2001 and then half that at Fasso Bortolo.|$|E
2500|$|In {{a drunken}} revelry, some of Curly Bill's friends were firing pistols {{into the air}} on October 27, 1880, [...] in a dark vacant lot between Toughnut and Allen Streets, near where the Birdcage Theater now stands. Tombstone's Town Marshal Fred White {{attempted}} to disarm Brocius and grabbed his weapon by the barrel. The gun discharged, striking White in the groin. Wyatt Earp had borrowed Fred Dodge's pistol and he pistol-whipped Brocius. At the preliminary hearing for Brocius afterward, Wyatt testified {{that he had heard}} White say: [...] "I am an officer; give me your pistol.” When he got close, he saw Brocius remove his pistol from his scabbard and White grab it by the barrel. He said he put his arms around Brocius from behind to see if he had any other weapons, and White [...] "gave a quick jerk and the pistol went off." [...] White fell to the ground, wounded. When the pistol discharged, Wyatt buffaloed Brocius and arrested him. Brocius complained, [...] "What have I done? I have not <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> be arrested for.” ...|$|E
2500|$|While United {{were eager}} to extend the loan deal, Larsson stated {{that he had made}} a promise to his family and his club to return on 12 March. This was {{confirmed}} on 20 February, when Larsson announced {{that he would not be}} extending his loan period. Despite this, Sir Alex Ferguson was full of praise for the striker, who scored 3 goals in 13 matches in all competitions during his three-month stay, saying, [...] "He's been fantastic for us, his professionalism, his attitude, everything he's done has been excellent." [...] "We would love him to stay but, obviously, he has made his promise to his family and Helsingborg and I think we should respect that – but I would have <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> keep him." [...] Larsson scored Manchester United's only goal in their win against Lille at Old Trafford in the Champions League. He made his final appearance for United on 10 March in an FA Cup sixth round tie away to Middlesbrough, ending in a 2–2 draw.|$|E

[...] "I {{just want to go}} back to my quiet life", she told the writer of a blog about comics at The Washington Post. Wellington announced on April 26 that he, too, was dropping out of the movement. [...] "I am aghast that so many people are posting deeply offensive pictures of the Prophet," [...] he wrote. [...] "Y'all go ahead if that's your bag, but count me out." [...] Norris acknowledged, [...] "I said that I wanted to counter fear and then I got afraid." [...] On April 29, Norris suggested that [...] "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" [...] be called off: [...] "Let's call off 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day' by changing it to 'Everybody Draw Al Gore Day' instead. Enough Mohammed drawings have already been made to get the point across. At this juncture, such drawings are only hurtful to more liberal and moderate Muslims who have not <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> endanger our first amendment rights." [...] On May 1, Norris posted a marked up version of her original cartoon, apologizing to Muslims.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} 17th century, {{it had become}} an ever more widely held view that {{equitable}} rules and the law of trusts varied unpredictably, as the jurist John Selden remarked, according {{to the size of}} the [...] "Chancellor's foot". Over the 18th century English property law, and trusts with it, mostly came to a standstill in legislation, but the Court of Chancery continued to develop equitable principles notably under Lord Nottingham (from 1673–1682), Lord King (1725–1733), Lord Hardwicke (1737–1756), and Lord Henley (1757–1766). In 1765, the first Professor of English law, William Blackstone wrote in his Commentaries on the Laws of England that equity should not be seen as a distinct body of rules, separate from the other laws of England. For example, although it was [...] "said that a court of equity determines according to the spirit of the rule and not according to the strictness of the letter," [...] wrote Blackstone, [...] "so also does a court of law" [...] and the result was that each system of courts was attempting to reach [...] "the same principles of justice and positive law". Blackstone's influence reached far. Chancellors became more concerned to standardise and harmonise equitable principles. At the start of the 19th century in Gee v Pritchard, referring to John Selden's quip, Lord Eldon (1801–1827) said 'Nothing would inflict upon me greater pain in quitting this place than the recollection that I had <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> justify the reproach that the equity of this court varies like the Chancellor's foot.' The Court of Chancery was meant to have mitigated the petty strictnesses of the common law of property. But instead, came to be seen as cumbersome and arcane. This was partly because until 1813, there was only the Lord Chancellor and the Master of the Rolls working as judges. Work was slow. In 1813, a Vice-Chancellor was appointed, in 1841 two more, and in 1851 two Lord Justices of Appeal in Chancery (making seven). But this did not save it from ridicule. In particular, Charles Dickens (1812–1870), who himself worked as a clerk near Chancery Lane, wrote Bleak House in 1853, depicting a fictional case of Jarndyce v Jarndyce, a Chancery matter about wills that nobody understood and dragged on for years and years. Within twenty years, separate courts of equity were abolished. Parliament merged the common law and equity courts into one system with the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873. Equitable principles would prevail over common law rules in case of conflict, but the separate identity of equity had ended. The separate identity of the trust, however, continued as strongly as before. In other parts of the Commonwealth (or the British Empire at the time) trust law principles, as then understood, were codified for the purpose of easy administration. The best example is the Indian Trusts Act 1882, which described a trust as meaning [...] "an obligation annexed to the ownership of property, and arising out of a confidence reposed in and accepted by the bearer".|$|E
