Goal {{of this study was to}} analyze factors associated with the <b>framing</b> <b>level</b> in banking in the province of Pisa. We collected data about age, gender, <b>framing</b> <b>level,</b> workplace and type of bank for bankers in Pisa through trade unionists. We collected data on 2018 workers and we found significant associations between <b>framing</b> <b>level</b> and aged over 40 years (OR = 4. 5; 95 % CI: 2. 9 - 6. 9), workplace in Pisa (OR = 0. 30; 95 % CI: 0. 20 - 0. 44) and male gender (OR = 2. 89; 95 % CI: 1. 98 - 4. 21). The first two factors are explainable with organizational characteristics. In fact for becoming manager you already have to work a number of year and in cities rather than in the surrounding municipalities, consistent with the size of bank. However, the third factor, already known in the literature in other work areas, requires further studies for explaining causes and helping to implement actions to reduce the gender gap. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{the field}} of {{multimedia}} retrieval in video, text frame classification is essential for text detection, event detection, event boundary detection etc. We propose a new text frame classification method that introduces a combination of wavelet and median-moment with k-means clustering to select probable text blocks among 16 equally sized blocks of a video frame. The same feature combination is used with a new Max-Min Clustering at the pixel level to choose probable dominant text pixels in the selected probable text blocks. For the probable text pixels, a so-called Mutual Nearest Neighbor based Symmetry is explored with a four-quadrant formation centered at the centroid of the probable dominant text pixels to know whether a block is a true text block or not. If a frame produces at least one true text block then it is considered as a text frame otherwise it is a non-text frame. Experimental results on different text and non-text datasets including two public datasets and our own created data show that the proposed method gives promising results in terms of recall and precision at the block and <b>frame</b> <b>levels.</b> Further, we also show how existing text detection methods tend to misclassify non-text frames as text frames in term of recall and precision at both the block and <b>frame</b> <b>levels...</b>|$|R
50|$|Both Mode 1 and 2 sectors use {{the first}} 16 bytes for header information, but {{differ in the}} {{remaining}} 2,336 bytes due {{to the use of}} error correction bytes. Unlike an audio CD, a CD-ROM cannot rely on error concealment by interpolation; a higher reliability of the retrieved data is required. To achieve improved error correction and detection, Mode 1, used mostly for digital data, adds a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code for error detection, and a third layer of Reed-Solomon error correction using a Reed-Solomon Product-like Code (RSPC). Mode 1 therefore contains 288 bytes per sector for error detection and correction, leaving 2,048 bytes per sector available for data. Mode 2, which is more appropriate for image or video data (where perfect reliability may be a little bit less important), contains no additional error detection or correction bytes, having therefore 2,336 available data bytes per sector. Note that both modes, like audio CDs, still benefit from the lower layers of error correction at the <b>frame</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E

Using the lens of frame-analysis, we unpack some key sceptic rationales and narratives. The analysis shows that sceptics share a master frame that privileges individualist-libertarian-progress-social order values, which are thus likely to conflict with the values implicit in conventional climate policy remedies.
