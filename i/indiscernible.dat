A {{reconnaissance}} flight into the hurricane discovered that the Hurricane Janet's eye measured only 20mi (32km) in diameter, with gale force winds extending 120mi (190km) away {{from the center of}} circulation. The flight also reported a minimum barometric pressure of 979mbar (hPa; 28.91inHg). After passing between the islands of Grenada and Carriacou in the morning hours of September23, Janet entered an area of unfavorable conditions in the eastern Caribbean Sea. As a result, the hurricane became disorganized, with winds weakening to 90mph (145km/h) by 1200UTC on September23. A U.S. Navy reconnaissance plane entered the hurricane early on September24, reporting a lack of organization, and noting an <b>indiscernible</b> center of circulation with weak rainbands. However, the hurricane began to reintensify in favorable conditions, regaining major hurricane strength by 1200UTC on September24 and subsequently Category 4hurricane intensity by the next day.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{noted for its}} [...] "dry, sterile" [...] production. Rasmussen said that was not his intention, as he tried for an ambient sound similar to the {{previous}} two albums. He was not present during the album's mixing, for which Steve Thompson and Michael Barbiero had been hired beforehand. Rasmussen felt that, in his absence from the mixing process, Thompson and Barbiero ended up using only the close microphones on the mix {{and none of the}} room microphones, thus causing the [...] "clicking", thin drum sound. Popoff noted that because of the strange production, the bass guitar was nearly inaudible, while the guitars sounded [...] "strangled mechanistic". He saw the [...] "synthetic" [...] percussion as another reason for the album's compressed sound. The sound has nearly-inaudible bass guitar, which Rasmussen claims was ordered by Hetfield and Ulrich after hearing the initial mixes, resulting in his belief that [...] "Jason Newsted, [...] Toby Wright and I are probably the only people who know what the bass parts actually sounded like on that album". Thompson similarly blamed Ulrich for the inaudible bass, stating that Ulrich ordered him to remove the bass from the mix. In their defense, Hetfield and Ulrich said that most of Newsted's bass lines closely followed the rhythm guitar lines {{to the point of being}} <b>indiscernible</b> from each other. A lack of direction is also partly to blame; since the album was largely produced by the band, there was no one present in the studio to guide the band's new bassist and tell him what was expected of him, something a producer would typically do. Newsted was not satisfied with the final mixes: [...] "The Justice album wasn't something that really felt good for me, because you really can't hear the bass." ...|$|E

40|$|The Principle of Identity of <b>Indiscernibles,</b> {{which says}} {{that there are no}} two {{particulars}} having in common all their properties, occupies an important part in Leibniz’s metaphysics. This principle, however, is normally held not to be necessarily true; indeed Max Black’s [2, p. 83] possibility of a world consisting of two exactly similar spheres consists of a refutation of the necessity of the Identity of <b>Indiscernibles.</b> And some results in quantum physics imply that the principle is false even in the actual world (French [6], French and Redhead [7]). Leibniz believed in the Identity of <b>Indiscernibles</b> because he thought it followed from other principles of his metaphysics. In particular, in a letter to Clarke Leibniz infers the Identity of <b>Indiscernibles</b> from the Principle of Sufficient Reason (L V, 21). 2 Specifically Leibniz there attempts to derive the Identity of <b>Indiscernibles</b> from an application of the Principle of Sufficient Reason to God’s act of creation, namely that God has a reason to create the world he creates. Since the Leibnizian God governs his act of creation by the Principle of the Best, according to which God wills only what is best, the reason he creates the world he creates is that it is the best possible world. Thus, although Leibniz does not say so explicitly, the Principle of the Best plays a part in his derivation of the Identity of <b>Indiscernibles</b> from the Principle of Sufficient Reason in his letters to Clarke. ...|$|R

2500|$|Badiou again turns here to {{mathematics}} and set theory – Badiou's language of ontology – {{to study the}} possibility of an <b>indiscernible</b> element existing extrinsically to the situation of ontology. He employs the strategy of the mathematician Paul J. Cohen, using what are called the conditions of sets. These conditions are thought of in terms of domination, a domination being that which defines a set. (If one takes, in binary language, the set with the condition 'items marked only with ones', any item marked with zero negates the property of the set. The condition which has only ones is thus dominated by any condition which has zeros in it [...]) Badiou reasons using these conditions that every discernible (nameable or constructible) set is dominated by the conditions which don't possess the property that makes it discernible as a set. (The property 'one' is always dominated by 'not one'.) These sets are, in line with constructible ontology, relative to one's being-in-the-world and one's being in language (where sets and concepts, such as the concept 'humanity', get their names). However, he continues, the dominations themselves are, whilst being relative concepts, not necessarily intrinsic to language and constructible thought; rather one can axiomatically define a domination – in the terms of mathematical ontology – as a set of conditions such that any condition outside the domination is dominated by at least one term inside the domination. One does not necessarily need to refer to constructible language to conceive of a 'set of dominations', which he refers to as the <b>indiscernible</b> set, or the generic set. It is therefore, he continues, possible to think beyond the strictures of the relativistic constructible universe of language, by a process Cohen calls forcing. And he concludes in following that while ontology can mark out a space for an inhabitant of the constructible situation to decide upon the <b>indiscernible,</b> it falls to the subject – about which the ontological situation cannot comment – to nominate this <b>indiscernible,</b> this generic point; and thus nominate, and give name to, the undecidable event. Badiou thereby marks out a philosophy by which to refute the apparent relativism or apoliticism in post-structuralist thought.|$|E
