40|$|Field {{emission}} {{properties of}} lanthanum monosulfide (LaS) thin films deposited by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) have been measured by building {{an array of}} new cold cathodes based on MEMS technology. The new cold cathode array has been fabricated by a sequence of steps on two separate (100) Si wafers, which in the final stage were bonded together with a high temperature, non-degasable <b>expoxy.</b> Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

This paper {{presents}} {{the study of}} the tensile, compressive, flexural, impact energy and water absorption characteristics of the luffa fiber reinforced <b>expoxy</b> polymer composites. Luffa fiber reinforced epoxy resin matrix composites have been developed by hand lay-up technique with varying process parameters such as fiber condition (treated and untreated), chopped randomly oriented and different volume fraction (30 %, 40 % and 50 %). Tensile strength varies from 9 MPa to 20 MPa, compressive strength varies from 75 MPa to 105 MPa, flexural strength varies from 1...|$|E
40|$|Thin {{films of}} <b>expoxy</b> nanocomposites {{modified}} by multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were prepared by shear mixing and spin casting. The electrical behaviour and its dependence with temperature between 243 and 353 degrees Kelvin {{were characterized by}} measuring the direct current (DC) conductivity. Depending on the fabrication process, both linear and non-linear relationships between conductivity and temperature were observed. In addition, the thermal history {{also played a role}} in dictating the conductivity. The implications of these observations for potential application of these files as strain sensors are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Based on the finite-element {{vibration}} equations of viscoelastic beam in Laplace {{domain and}} the corresponding analytical solution, a semi-analytical frequency equation, which contains the complex modulus of the viscoelastic material, is derived. With several simple measuring instruments, the vibration parameters of the viscoelastic beams can be measured. According to the semi-analytical frequency equation, the complex modulus of the viscoelastic material can be calculated by a nonlinear programming algorithm. As an illustrative example, the vibration test of free-free beams made of viscoelastic <b>expoxy</b> composite material is presented. A five-parameter complex modulus is assumed and evaluated...|$|E
40|$|<b>Expoxy</b> nanocomposites with multiwell carbon {{nanotubes}} (mwcnts) filler up to 0. 3 %wt {{were prepared}} by sheer mixing and good dispersion of the MWCNTS in the epoxy was successfully achieved. The electrical behaviour {{was characterized by}} measurements of the alternating current (ac) and direct current (dc) conductives at room temperature. Typical percolation behaviour was observed at a low percolation threshold of 0. 055 %. Frequency independent ac conductivity was observed at low frequencies but not at high frequencies. An equivalent circuit models was used to predict the impedence response in these nanocomposites...|$|E
40|$|Thermoset prepregs of <b>expoxy</b> and {{polyimide}} {{have been}} produced by electrostatic deposition of charged fluidized polymer powders on spread continuous fiber tows. The powders are melted onto the fibers by radiant heating to adhere the polymer to the fiber. This process produces towpreg uniformly and rapidly without imposing severe stresses on the fibers. The towpregs produced by this novel process were consolidated to make unidirectional laminates for mechanical testing. Low void content samples have been made and demonstrated by C-scan and scanning electron microscopy. The mechanical properties of unidirectional laminates are equivalent to composites fabricated by conventional techniques...|$|E
40|$|Ultra-light {{carbon fiber}} {{composite}} materials are being utilized in artificial limbs with increasing frequency in recent years. Dr. Arthur Copes, an orthotist from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, has developed a graphite <b>expoxy</b> composite material artificial ankle (Copes/Bionic Ankle) that {{is intended to be}} used by amputees who require the most advanced above-and-below-the-knee prosthetic devices. The Copes/Bionic Ankle is designed to reproduce the function of the natural ankle joint by allowing the composite material to act as a spring mechanism without the use of metal mechanical parts. NASA Marshall Space Flight Center has {{agreed to participate in the}} design effort by providing the structural analysis of the artificial ankle design...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{is to find out}} correlation of using DOP plasticier and Shorea Parvifolis Dyer wood flour filler to physical properties of PVC compound for shoe lasting. PVC compound is made from PVC resin added by other ingredients as plasticizer, stabilizer, lubricant and filler. Ingredient used in this {{research is}} DOP, <b>Expoxy</b> oil, BaCdZn, Stearic acid, CaCO 3 filler and wood flour by variation of DOP and filler percentage. PVC compound produced is tested its physical properties for hardness, impact strength and tensil strength.

40|$|A {{series of}} blends of a PE-PEO diblock {{copolymer}} (M= 1400) with a bisphenol A-type <b>expoxy</b> resin (ER) is {{studied in the}} full range of composition. Curing of the mixture was done at T = 110 ? C. DSC shows well separated melting peaks for both blocks of the copolymer. The ER rich samples only show the melting of the PE domains. The structure of the copolymer is investigated with SAXS. It shows a lamellar microphase separated structure at room temperature and disorder at high T. In the blends a sequence of structures is found with decreasing fraction of the copolymer. The ER is swelling the PEO domains thus increasing the lamellar period. Heterogeneous structures are found at intermediate compositions. Samples with small fraction of copolymer are characterized as micellar structures. Several models are applied to describe the SAXS results. The lamellar as well as the micellar structures are quantitatively described. The intermediate range is heterogeneous displaying structure on an hierarchy of length scales...|$|E
40|$|It is {{the purpose}} of this work to gain {{knowledge}} of the glassy materials used as matrices in composites and to study the homogeneity resulting from the curing process. An attempt is made to link the glass transition quantitatively with the presence of a given material. <b>Expoxy</b> resins containing various amounts of hardener (TGDDM/DDS system) were cured in a muffle furnace at 473 K for seven hours. The glass transition temperature, T sub g versus weight minus percent of hardener in the epoxy resin were measured. A limit was rapidly reached in T sub g at only two percent hardener. Thus, the glass transition of the fully cured epoxy-amine matrix seems not much different from the epoxide-epoxide cure. The T sub g versus cure-time for the epoxide-epoxide reaction was also studied. My 720 was cured by itself in an oil bath at 473 K for different lengths of time. The T sub g was found to increase exponentially with the cure time, and a maximum T sub g of about 450 K was reached after eleven hours. The reaction was found to be inhibited by running the sample under argon...|$|E
