50|$|A solenoid bolt {{is a type}} of electronic-mechanical locking mechanism. This type of lock is {{characterized}} by the use of a solenoid to throw the bolt. Sophisticated solenoid bolt locks may use microprocessors to perform voltage regulation, reduce power consumption, and/or provide access control. Depending on the strength of the solenoid, some models can provide a holding force on the order of 1000 kg. A solenoid bolt can be designed either to fail open (the lock opens on power loss) or to <b>fail</b> <b>closed</b> (the device is locked upon power loss); cf fail safe. Some models may be suitable for high-security sites.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{some aspects of}} the {{mechanics}} of anisotropic non-linearly elastic solids for which the anisotropy is associated with two preferred directions, thereby modelling the effect of two families of fiber reinforcement. Particular attention is focused {{on the role of the}} invariant I- 8, which couples the fiber kinematics in the constitutive law, and results are illustrated for a model strain-energy function that includes this invariant. The distinctive effects of this invariant on the stress-strain behaviour of the material and on the failure of ellipticity are discussed separately for pure homogeneous deformation and for a simple shear deformation. For pure homogeneous deformation it is shown that ellipticity fails with an associated weak surface of discontinuity that bisects the fiber directions. Moreover, ellipticity <b>fails</b> <b>close</b> to the reference configuration in either tension or compression. For simple shear it is found that loss of ellipticity occurs both for positive and negative shearing, and the orientation of the weak surface relative to the fiber directions is characterized in each case. Again ellipticity <b>fails</b> <b>close</b> to the reference configuration, and inclusion of the invariant I- 8 in the constitutive law therefore has a pronounced destabilizing influence...|$|R

40|$|As {{part of a}} {{modification}} project {{for one of the}} fields in the North Sea, the optimal failure position of three new globe valves has been studied. In a gas compression train, the gas needs to be cooled to a set temperature, and the globe valves control the amount of cooling medium required through the heat exchangers to reach this set temperature. A wrong choice of failure position could potentially cause expensive and important process equipment to get damaged. The four failure positions that have been studied are <b>fail</b> open, <b>fail</b> <b>close,</b> <b>fail</b> <b>close</b> with travel stop and fail in position. Results were obtained using the simulation tools HYSYS and PIPENET, and calculations in Excel. <b>Fail</b> <b>close</b> is not an optimal failure position, but it has been considered the most optimal as of today. It is very likely that this failure position will lead to a process shut down, which will give reduced production. The reason why it is still considered the most optimal solution is that no equipment will get damaged, and the actuator solution is well proven and trustable. The results show that fail in position is the failure position which is best from a process point of view. There are however several questions connected to the actuator solution of fail in position. It is a relatively new failure position solution, which is why AKSO {{have not been able to}} get any feedback on how it works. It is very likely that fail in position will be used in similar installations in the future, when the actuator solution has been verified and improved if necessary. It has been found that fail open is the least optimal failure solution. As the heat exchanger cooling medium demand will increase significantly when the valves are left fully open, there will be deficit of cooling medium to the other cooling medium consumers. A possible consequence of this is a process shutdown to avoid overheating of important process equipment. Another possible consequence of fail open as the failure position is hydrate formation, which in worst case can lead to damages to the compressors...|$|R
