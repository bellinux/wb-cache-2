50|$|The man largely {{responsible}} {{for the development of the}} TMR was Dr Alan Arnold Griffith, who had worked on gas turbine design at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE), in the 1920s and was a pioneer of <b>jet</b> <b>lift</b> technology. In 1939, Griffith had been employed by Rolls-Royce. During the 1940s, he conceived of using jet propulsion as a method of directly providing vertical lift to produce an aircraft that could take off vertically. The construction of a such an aircraft for research purposes was suggested by Griffith.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s the British MoD and the US DoD both {{conducted}} studies into {{lift jet}} solutions. The US studies {{eventually led to}} the F-35 Lightning II. In 1988 the Tornado-sized P.125 design was intended to meet the requirements for a supersonic stealthy STOVL interdictor. There were to be non-STOVL and STOVL variants of the P.125. Both had a single reheated (afterburning) turbofan with a vectorable rear nozzle. The STOVL variant would have maintained vertical flight using three <b>jet</b> <b>lift</b> nozzles. The pilot of the P.125 would have sat highly reclined and would not have had direct sight of the outside world. In the 1990s the UK government decided to join the JSF (now F-35) programme rather than continue the P.125.|$|E
50|$|A novel {{alternative}} to the lift jet for auxiliary vertical thrust is to be employed by the VTOL Lockheed F-35B version of the U.S. Joint Strike Fighter program. This {{does not have a}} <b>jet</b> <b>lift</b> engine, but a central lift fan that is powered by the main engine via a driveshaft. When not needed, it is declutched from the engine so that it does not consume power (analogous to the transfer case of a four-wheel drive vehicle). The operational viability of this system remains to be seen, and all of the above drawbacks still apply: it is dead weight in flight, and together with the aircraft's internal weapons bays it takes up a great deal of internal space, reducing fuel and avionics load and requiring a bulkier and wider fuselage cross-section (which passes on to the A and C versions, even though they don't have a fan or V/STOL capability). It has, however, in pre-operational testing proven the ability to take off vertically and go supersonic in level flight in the same mission, a first for a combat aircraft.|$|E

40|$|Summary. [...] As a {{preliminary}} {{investigation of the}} effects of high sweep and low aspect ratio on jet-flap wings, some wind-tunnel experiments were carried out on a half-model of a 60 -deg delta wing, already tested with blowing to prevent flow separation over a trailing-edge flap. Much larger values of the blowing-momentum coefficient C, ' than betore were achieved by using a low tunnel speed. Balance measurements were made of lift, pitching moment and thrust for C, ' values up to 1. 5, wing incidences between [...] 4 deg and + 20 deg, and flap angles of 30, 60 and 90 deg. Although substantial magnification of the direct <b>jet</b> <b>lift</b> occurred, the movement of the centre of lift was appreciable and positive values of the thrust occurred only at the lowest flap angle. 1.

A penalty associated with a high utility factor is a high wing loading. This leads to the necessity of using auxiliary lift when high utilization factors are obtained, It is shown that a propulsive engine modified to give <b>jet</b> <b>lift</b> at landing and possibly take-off {{is likely to be the}} best means of obtaining auxiliary lift. The optimum cruise height is less than that corresponding to maximum lift drag ratio because of the weight penalty associated with providing adequate thrust. The integrated layout is not suitable for airliners required to carry less than a hundred passengers, but becomes extremely attractive for a very large number of passengers In this case the central part of the wing area should be of constant depth with a cabin of side by side multi- bubble form. The delta planform is not ideal for an integrated layout, Better space utilization can be obtained using a pointed pear shaped Planform.

40|$|Thermal and Flow Field Investigations of a Micro-Tangential-Jet Film Cooling Scheme on Gas Turbine Components Othman Hassan, Ph. D. Concordia University, 2013 Gas {{turbines}} play a {{major role}} in modern aerospace and in industrial power generation nowadays. Advanced gas turbines are designed to operate at increasingly higher inlet turbine gas temperature to increase their efficiency and specific power output. In order to enable this increase in the operating temperature, high-temperature resistant materials, Thermal-Barrier Coatings (TBCs), and advanced cooling techniques, are employed. Internal cooling, impingement cooling, and film cooling, are the typical cooling techniques that are being used nowadays for gas turbine engines cooling. For the past five decades, significant efforts have been implemented in the area of film cooling to design and investigate the performance of numerous cooling schemes at various operating conditions and geometries. However, the achieved effectiveness to date, especially over actual airfoil geometries, is still relatively low. Further efforts are essential to propose novel designs that are capable of providing the required cooling loads. The present study investigates the thermal performance and flow characteristics downstream a new film cooling scheme over a gas turbine vane and a flat plate. The state-of-the-art transient Thermochromic Liquid Crystal (TLC) technique has been employed for film cooling measurements, while the Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique has been employed for flow field investigations. Validation of all measurement techniques were conducted and good agreement with literature works has been achieved. The Micro-Tangential-Jet (MTJ) scheme is a discrete-holes shaped cooling scheme with micro sized exit height that supplies the jet parallel to the surface. The MTJ scheme consists of two main parts, a circular supply micro-tube, and a shaped exit parallel to the vane surface. The shaped exit of the scheme starts with a circular cross section. Lateral expansion angles are then applied in both directions and a relatively constant height is maintained throughout the scheme yielding a squared exit. Due to the micro thickness of the jet, a deep penetration inside the main stream is achievable, while maintaining a tangential injection direction to the surface, thereby avoiding <b>jet</b> <b>lift</b> off. The film cooling performance of one row of MTJ scheme on the vane pressure side and another row on the suction side is investigated at different blowing ratios using the transient TLC technique. Comparisons with the film cooling performance of previously proposed shaped schemes are carried out to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of the new design. Mach number distributions over the airfoil surface are determined with and without the MTJ scheme to investigate the effect of the added material on the airfoil characteristics. A comprehensive analysis based on the current findings, previous efforts in the literature, and the flow field investigations using the PIV technique downstream the MTJ scheme is presented. Overall, the new design showed superior film cooling performance, compared to the best achieved results in literature. The effectiveness distribution downstream the MTJ scheme was characterized with superior lateral spreading over both pressure and suction surfaces. The measurements showed similarity in the characteristics of the 2 -D film downstream the MTJ scheme and the one that accompanies the injection from continuous slot schemes. Moreover, the investigations showed that the presence of the MTJ scheme over the vane pressure or suction sides did not result in significant HTC augmentation, especially at blowing ratios less than unity. The MTJ scheme could be the first of a new generation of film cooling schemes over airfoil geometries. ...|$|E

Due to the changes of the initial combustion conditions, mixing and aerodynamics which resulted from the perturbation of the side micro-jets, such a <b>lifted</b> <b>jet</b> flame has different flame structure compared with the common premixed flame. Results demonstrate that use of the micro-jets can control, to a certain extent, the flame structure, including the flame length, lift-off distance and blow-off limit. With the same fuel and air flow rate, the flame length with the side micro-jets will decrease about 5 %- 40 % as the air volume ratio α increases from 58 %- 76 %. Compared with the common diffusion flame, the jet flame with the side micro-jets demonstrates to be easier to be a momentum-dominated flame. The flame length with 2 micro-jets is about 5 % less than with 6 micro-jets under the same fuel and air flow rate. With the same α, the fewer number of the controlled jets lead to the flame with relatively shorter length, not easier to be blown off and higher NOx emission.
