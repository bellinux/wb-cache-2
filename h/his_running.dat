5|$|Before the DPP {{became the}} ruling party, Chen {{suggested}} that then-incumbent magistrate of Taoyuan County Annette Lu {{would be a}} better choice for Chen Shui-bian's presidential running mate than any other party member. Lu was eventually selected as <b>his</b> <b>running</b> mate.|$|E
5|$|Both Eisenhower's {{speech to}} the excited crowd and {{telegram}} to <b>his</b> <b>running</b> mate were noncommittal. The general applauded <b>his</b> <b>running</b> mate for his speech, but stated that the two had to meet face to face before a final decision could be made. While Eisenhower affirmed that the RNC {{had the power to}} elect a replacement candidate, Eisenhower indicated that the committee would, most likely, be guided by his wishes. Eisenhower asked Nixon to meet with him in person in Wheeling, West Virginia, where the general's campaign was next scheduled to go. Eisenhower's telegram was delayed in transmission and lost among the flood being sent to Nixon's suite, and the latter learned of <b>his</b> <b>running</b> mate's position from a wire service report.|$|E
5|$|After having {{consulted}} for Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, Gingrich encouraged {{his fellow}} Republicans to unify behind Trump, who had by then become the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Gingrich reportedly figured among Trump's final three choices to be <b>his</b> <b>running</b> mate; the position ultimately went to Mike Pence, a politician {{known for his}} role as Governor of Indiana.|$|E

5|$|Biden unsuccessfully {{sought the}} Democratic presidential {{nomination}} in 1988 and in 2008, both times dropping out after lackluster showings. In the 2008 presidential election, Barack Obama chose Biden to be <b>his</b> <b>running</b> mate in the race, which they won. He {{became the first}} Roman Catholic, and the first Delawarean, to be Vice President of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{attended}} {{the inauguration of}} father-in-law George H. W. Bush as Vice President in January 1981, after he and <b>his</b> <b>running</b> mate Ronald Reagan won the 1980 presidential election.

5|$|Chandler lost to Breathitt in {{the primary}} by more than 60,000 votes, {{although}} <b>his</b> <b>running</b> mate, Harry Lee Waterfield, won the nomination for lieutenant governor.

5|$|During this period, Miller {{achieved}} {{more success}} as a footballer, following his brothers in joining the Brighton Football Club in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) in 1937. A defender, Miller initially played on the half-back flank before moving to full back during his third season, in 1939. At this stage, he lacked the strength to hip and shoulder his opponents and relied on <b>his</b> <b>running</b> ability and accurate kicking.|$|E
5|$|Goldwater {{selected}} William E. Miller, U.S. Representative {{and chairman}} of the Republican National Committee, as <b>his</b> <b>running</b> mate for the general election. Although virtually unknown to many voters, Miller was viewed by those familiar with him as a wise choice for the vice-presidential nomination, with his supporters arguing that he would {{play a key role in}} waging an aggressive campaign against Lyndon Johnson and the Democrats.|$|E
5|$|His spirits buoyed, Nixon {{sought a}} second term, {{but some of}} Eisenhower's aides aimed to {{displace}} him. In a December 1955 meeting, Eisenhower proposed that Nixon not run for reelection {{in order to give}} him administrative experience before a 1960 presidential run and instead become a Cabinet officer in a second Eisenhower administration. Nixon believed such an action would destroy his political career. When Eisenhower announced his reelection bid in February 1956, he hedged on the choice of <b>his</b> <b>running</b> mate, stating that it was improper to address that question until he had been renominated. Although no Republican was opposing Eisenhower, Nixon received a substantial number of write-in votes against the President in the 1956 New Hampshire primary election. In late April, the President announced that Nixon would again be <b>his</b> <b>running</b> mate. Eisenhower and Nixon were reelected by a comfortable margin in the November 1956 election.|$|E

5|$|Jackson reluctantly {{supported}} Al Gore when {{he became}} the Democratic presidential nominee, saying Gore and <b>his</b> <b>running</b> mate Joe Lieberman were not liberal enough but that he supported Gore as the only alternative to George W.

Jackson was still considered a likely appointee for United States Secretary of Education if Gore was elected.|$|E

5|$|Johnson wanted Humphrey to pick Sanford as <b>his</b> <b>running</b> mate. On one occasion, the Humphrey {{campaign}} asked Sanford if {{he wanted}} to be the vice presidential candidate.

5|$|On January 26, 2009, Lieutenant Governor Daniel Mongiardo {{announced}} that he would seek the Democratic nomination to challenge incumbent Senator Jim Bunning in the 2010 senatorial election.
