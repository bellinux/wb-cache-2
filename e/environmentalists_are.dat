25|$|<b>Environmentalists</b> <b>are</b> {{concerned}} about loss of biodiversity {{that will result}} from destruction of the forest, and also about {{the release of the}} carbon contained within the vegetation, which could accelerate global warming. Amazonian evergreen forests account for about 10% of the world's terrestrial primary productivity and 10% of the carbon stores in ecosystems—of the order of 1.1×1011 metric tonnes of carbon. Amazonian forests are estimated to have accumulated 0.62±0.37 tons of carbon per hectare per year between 1975 and 1996.|$|E
25|$|Journalist George Monbiot {{has argued}} for a 5-year freeze on {{biofuels}} while their impact on poor communities and the environment is assessed. It {{has been suggested that}} a problem with Monbiot's approach is that economic drivers may be required in order to push through the development of more sustainable second-generation biofuel processes: it is possible that these could be stalled if biofuel production decreases. Some <b>environmentalists</b> <b>are</b> suspicious that second-generation biofuels may not solve the problem of a potential clash with food as they also use significant agricultural resources such as water.|$|E

25|$|The Roșia Montană Project, {{a mining}} project aimed {{to bring to}} the surface 350 tonnes of gold and 1,500 tonnes of silver, met a {{significant}} resistance from environmental groups in Romania and neighbouring countries. Among the dissatisfactions of <b>environmentalists</b> <b>are</b> the pollution by cyanidation and the extremely low percentage of which Romania will benefit from this exploitation. A concern {{was the fact that the}} legislation would give the Roșia Montană Gold Corporation the right to give compulsory purchase orders to the residents of Roșia Montană who refused to sell their houses and lands. The draft law also sets time limits for the state authorities to grant all permits, regardless of potential infringements of national legislation or of court rulings.|$|E

500|$|Since the episode's initial airing, Blinky {{has been}} {{mentioned}} several times in news articles regarding nuclear waste and mutation. A reporter for the Lincoln Journal Star compared Blinky to a rainbow trout with two mouths caught in Lincoln, Nebraska, in 2005. The fish was mentioned in a National Review article discussing a legislation {{which would make it}} illegal to import, possess or release alive into California any live transgenic fish: [...] "Sounds like someone watched one too many episodes of The Simpsons with Blinky, the three-eyed fish that swims by the nuclear-power plant." [...] Matt Smith of SF Weekly compared Blinky to a type of fish found in San Francisco Bay, which, {{according to a study by}} the University of California, Davis, had a shrunken brain and misshapen body that had been caused by the dumping of toxic chemicals into the bay. In an article about the now closed nuclear weapons production facility Rocky Flats Plant, Brian Park of The Rocky Mountain Collegian joked that after its closure, [...] "years of clean up ensued and now the area is a wildlife refuge; no word yet if Blinky has been spotted." [...] Barbara Taormina of the North Shore Sunday wrote in her article about the new liquefied natural gas (LNG) pipeline in Massachusetts Bay: [...] "Will Blinky, the mutant three-eyed fish from The Simpsons be showing up in Massachusetts Bay? Probably not, but local <b>environmentalists</b> <b>are</b> worried that digging for the new LNG pipeline may stir up radioactive waste dumped decades ago." [...] In his article about the nuclear power plant operator Exelon, Thomas M. Anderson of Kiplinger wrote: [...] "The thought of more nuclear power may conjure up images of the Three Mile Island accident or Blinky , but a growing number of policymakers and even <b>environmentalists</b> <b>are</b> coming to appreciate the advantages of atomic energy." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Columbia Journal of Environmental Law {{states that}} <b>environmentalists</b> <b>are</b> {{opposed to the}} [...] "unitary waters" [...] theory because it exempts polluters from obtaining federal permits which are usually {{required}} for polluting bodies of water, {{so long as the}} transferrer does not add additional pollutants to the transferred water.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2009, The Washington Post {{reported}} that nuclear power {{is emerging as}} [...] "...perhaps the world's most unlikely weapon against climate change, {{with the backing of}} even some green activists who once campaigned against it." [...] The article said that rather than deride the potential for nuclear power, some <b>environmentalists</b> <b>are</b> embracing it, and that presently there is only [...] "muted opposition"—nothing like the protests and plant invasions that helped define the anti-nuclear movement in the United States during the 1970s.|$|E
2500|$|Legal {{actions by}} Friends of the Everglades {{have gone to}} the Supreme Court of the United States on two occasions.

The Supreme Court sent the case back to the District Court to be reargued in the fall of 2004. Current Florida Governor Rick Scott has stated that he favors [...] "restoration, not litigation," [...] which provides a hopeful rallying cry for environmentalists. However, state funding for what is required to prevent and clean chemical pollution in the Everglades is not adequate {{to address the needs of}} the ecosystem. Enforcement of [...] "better management practices" [...] in big sugar farming cuts off the pollution at its source. The state seems willing to negotiate the two sides of the contentious debate, that of big sugar and conservationists, but <b>environmentalists</b> <b>are</b> not convinced that it will be enough to adequately address the needs of the Everglades.|$|E
