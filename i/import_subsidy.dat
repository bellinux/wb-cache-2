To offset the tax credits received by imported ethanol, the United States instituted an import tariff. This study provides insights about the quantitative nature of a U.

The theoretical results from a horizontally related ethanol-gasoline partial equilibrium model show that the United States should provide an <b>import</b> <b>subsidy</b> rather than impose a tariff.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to derive some economic indicators which can help in explaining the effect of government policies on sugar imports. The paper developed and statistically estimated an import demand function for sugar with the aim of providing quantitative estimates of the response of imports to the changing government policies. The results show that the factors which significantly affect sugar imports are: (1) the traditional non-policy variables: deflated imported price of sugar, and real income per capita. (2) the policy variables: deflated <b>import</b> <b>subsidy,</b> and year-ending stock. The estimated elasticities of deflated imported price, real income per capita, deflated <b>import</b> <b>subsidy,</b> and the ending stock are: - 0. 94, 1. 30, 0. 10, and - 0. 31 respectively. Results of the simulation assuming a 30 % increase in international price of sugar show that annual quantity of imported sugar in the 1991 - 1995 period will be 408578, 317712, 388722, 412896, 451686 ton, respectively.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of preferential trade liberalization {{over the last}} 20 years has {{raised the question of}} whether it slows down multilateral trade liberalization. Recent theoretical and empirical evidence indicates this is the case even for unilateral preferences that developed countries provide to small and poor countries but there is no estimate of the resulting welfare costs. To avoid this stumbling block effect we suggest replacing unilateral preferences by a fixed <b>import</b> <b>subsidy.</b> We argue that this scheme would reduce the drag of preferences on multilateral liberalization and generate a Pareto improvement. More importantly, we provide the first estimates of the welfare cost of preferential liberalization as a stumbling block to multilateral liberalization. By combining recent estimates of the stumbling block effect of preferences with data for 170 countries and over 5, 000 products we calculate the welfare effects of the United States, European Union and Japan switching from unilateral preferences to Least Developed Countries to the <b>import</b> <b>subsidy</b> scheme. Even in a model with no dynamic gains to trade we find that the switch produces an annual net welfare gain for the 170 countries ($ 4, 354 million) and for each group: the United States, European Union and Japan ($ 2, 934 million), Least Developed Countries ($ 520 million) {{and the rest of the}} world ($ 900 million) ...|$|E

Irrespective of the substitutability, free trade doesn’t maximize the aggregate output.

40|$|We study {{trade policy}} in a two-sector Krugman-type trade model with home market effects. We allow for three {{different}} instruments: tariffs, export taxes and production subsidies. For each instrument, we consider unilateral trade policy without retaliation.

For tariffs and export taxes we show that results depend crucially on the (in) efficiency of the free trade allocation. When starting from an allocation that is distorted because of monopolistic competition, the home market effect (and in the case of export taxes also the desire to correct for the monopolistic inefficiency) induces policy makers to set a tariff (an export subsidy). However, when monopolistic distortions are corrected, terms of trade effects dominate the choice of trade policy and lead to an <b>import</b> <b>subsidy</b> (an export tax) ...|$|E

Our model extends the inter-industry trade model Eaton and Kortum (2002), intra-industry model of Krugman (1980), and firm heterogeneous model of Melitz (2003). Subsidies on intermediate good imports or export subsidies of specific industries affect welfare of countries through direct effects on wages and cost of input bundles of production (labor and intermediate goods), and indirectly through changes in term of trades, and endogenous entries and exits in many industries due to the general equilibrium adjustment of the input-output linkages which are missed in the Eaton and Kortum (2002) environment.

40|$|In {{this article}} the authors explore, in a {{preliminary}} way, some {{of the effects of}} learning-by-doing on the structure, conduct and performance of an industry. Learning is seen as a decline in a firm's unit production cost as a consequence of an increase in its cumulative production experience. Optimal pricing rules for nationalized industry are derived first. The authors then consider the case of an incumbent firm which is threatened by a rival possessing the option of entering the market now or {{at any time in the}} (finite) future. Entry is assumed to involve a (small) fixed cost which must be sunk. In a central example it is shown that the presence of the potential entrant has absolutely no effect on the behaviour of the incumbent. The authors therefore proceed to examine the implications of various government policies. Examples are produced where a variant of the classical infant-industry argument holds and also ones where the presence of a foreign learning curve provides an argument for the domestic government to introduce an <b>import</b> <b>subsidy.</b> Competition; Import Subsidies; Industrial Policy; Learning; Monopoly; Strategic Behaviour; Sunk Costs...|$|E
40|$|Targeted tariffs are {{a common}} tool used by {{importing}} countries to protect domestic fish producers. Unfortunately, such tariffs, in general, are ineffectual. The reason is twofold. First, fish tend to be homogenous across supply sources, which means a tariff on one supply source acts as an implicit <b>import</b> <b>subsidy</b> to other supply sources. Second, source-specific import shares tend to be small, {{which means that the}} import demand elasticity is large, both absolutely and in relation to the import supply elasticity. As a consequence, most of the tariff is borne by foreign producers rather than domestic consumers. Indeed, analysis of a $ 0. 50 /lb. tariff on catfish imports from Vietnam indicates that the tariff would increase the US price by at most $ 0. 17 /lb. in the short run and $ 0. 11 /lb. in the long run. In light of this, and the potential for retaliation, a better policy option may be market promotion. To examine this, an expression is developed to indicate the optimal promotion levy. Applying the expression to catfish, results suggest that a levy of between 2 % and 4 % on imports would be optimal {{in the sense that the}} induced promotion expenditure would maximize foreign producer surplus.

The results show that agricultural support in industrial countries is highly distortionary and tariffs have a larger distortionary impact than subsidies.

The results also show that most of the benefits from removing agricultural support accrue to the countries that liberalize.

40|$|World Bank, This paper {{examines}} {{the problems of}} Russia’s post-communist economic transformation. Its main thesis is that the Russian attempt at radical economic reform largely failed, because of extraordinary rent-seeking by old enterprise managers through export rents, subsidized credits, <b>import</b> <b>subsidies</b> and direct government subsidies, while they gained little from privatization. The reason why the managers were so strong was that the Soviet Union left large economic distortions behind and a virtually unconstrained economic elite. The reforms could have been reinforced if democratic institutions had been developed faster, or if the West had provided financial support for the reforms in early 1992. Over time, rents have dwindled, but Russian institutions have been seriously damaged by corruption. Intense competition over rents contributed to the financial crash in August 1998, but the competition also limits the rents, and might ease the way for future reforms. 2 During the last decade, Russia’s GDP has fallen by about 40 percent, and GDP is likely to fall by several percent in 1999.
