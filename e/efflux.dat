5|$|But {{transmission}} of Ca2+ is not unidirectional; rather, it is a two-way street. The {{properties of the}} Ca2+ pump SERCA and the channel IP3R present on the ER membrane facilitate feedback regulation coordinated by MAM function. In particular, the clearance of Ca2+ by the MAM allows for spatio-temporal patterning of Ca2+ signaling because Ca2+ alters IP3R activity in a biphasic manner. SERCA is likewise affected by mitochondrial feedback: uptake of Ca2+ by the MAM stimulates ATP production, thus providing energy that enables SERCA to reload the ER with Ca2+ for continued Ca2+ <b>efflux</b> at the MAM. Thus, the MAM is not a passive buffer for Ca2+ puffs; rather it helps modulate further Ca2+ signaling through feedback loops that affect ER dynamics.|$|E
5|$|Inside the brain, {{dopamine}} {{functions as}} a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator, and is controlled {{by a set of}} mechanisms common to all monoamine neurotransmitters. After synthesis, dopamine is transported from the cytosol into synaptic vesicles by a solute carrier—a vesicular monoamine transporter, VMAT2. Dopamine is stored in these vesicles until it is ejected into the synaptic cleft. In most cases, the release of dopamine occurs through a process called exocytosis which is caused by action potentials, {{but it can also be}} caused by the activity of an intracellular trace amine-associated receptor, TAAR1. TAAR1 is a high-affinity receptor for dopamine, trace amines, and certain substituted amphetamines that is located along membranes in the intracellular milieu of the presynaptic cell; activation of the receptor can regulate dopamine signaling by inducing dopamine reuptake inhibition and <b>efflux</b> as well as by inhibiting neuronal firing through a diverse set of mechanisms.|$|E

However, recent studies report raised methane (CH 4) <b>effluxes</b> during the first years after flooding. A minerotrophic fen in north-east Germany that was re-wetted 15 years ago was exposed to exceptionally heavy rainfall and freshwater flooding in August 2011. We measured CH 4 <b>effluxes</b> from wetland vegetation stands dominated by Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud., Typha latifolia L. and Carex acutiformis Ehrh., using the closed-chamber method, fortnightly from March 2011 to March 2012 with extra sampling during the flooding. The respective annual <b>effluxes</b> of CH 4 (mean ± 1 standard error) from the three vegetation types were 18. 5 ± 1. 3, 21. 1 ± 1. 2 and 47. 5 ± 5. 0 g m- 2 a- 1, with the August <b>effluxes</b> contributing 40 %, 50 % and 10 % of the annual <b>effluxes.</b> Despite the freshwater flooding in August, annual CH 4 <b>effluxes</b> from the 15 -year re-wetted fen {{are similar to those}} reported from pristine fens. These results are promising because they indicate that, although CH 4 <b>effluxes</b> are elevated after re-wetting, they may return to values typical for pristine fens after 15 years. Hence, re-wetting can achieve the purpose of reducing greenhouse gas <b>effluxes</b> from drained minerotrophic fens...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} tree (lodgepole pine) {{planting}} {{with and without}} intensive drainage on soil greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes was assessed after 45 yr at a raised peatbog in West Flanders Moss, central Scotland. Fluxes of CO 2 CH 4 and N 2 O from the soil were monitored over a 2 -yr period every 2 to 4 weeks using the static opaque chamber method in a randomised experimental block trial with the following treatments: drained and planted (DP), undrained and planted (uDP), undrained and unplanted (uDuP) and for reference also from an adjoining near-pristine area of bog at East Flanders Moss (n-pris). There was a strong seasonal pattern in both CO 2 and CH 4 <b>effluxes</b> which were significantly higher in late spring and summer months because of warmer temperatures. <b>Effluxes</b> of N 2 O were low and {{no significant differences were}} observed between the treatments. Annual CH 4 emissions increased with the proximity of the water table to the soil surface across treatments in the order: DP 4 m − 2 yr − 1, respectively. For CO 2, <b>effluxes</b> increased in the order uDP 2 m − 2 yr − 1, respectively. CO 2 <b>effluxes</b> dominated the total net GHG emission, calculated using the global warming potential (GWP) of the three GHGs for each treatment (76 – 98 %), and only in the n-pris site was CH 4 a substantial contribution (23 %). Based on soil <b>effluxes</b> only, the near pristine (n-pris) peatbog had 43 % higher total net GHG emission compared with the DP treatment because of high CH 4 <b>effluxes</b> and the DP treatment had 33 % higher total net emission compared with the uDP because drainage increased CO 2 <b>effluxes.</b> Restoration is likely to increase CH 4 emissions, but reduce CO 2 <b>effluxes.</b> Our study suggests that if estimates of CO 2 uptake by vegetation from similar peatbog sites were included, the total net GHG emission of restored peatbog would still be higher than that of the peatbog with trees...|$|R
40|$|Renewed {{interest}} in the measurement of cellular K(+) <b>effluxes</b> has been prompted by the observation that potassium plays an active and important role in numerous key cellular events, in particular cell necrosis and apoptosis.

5|$|Regulating ER {{release of}} Ca2+ at the MAM is {{especially}} critical because only a certain window of Ca2+ uptake sustains the mitochondria, and consequently the cell, at homeostasis. Sufficient intraorganelle Ca2+ signaling {{is required to}} stimulate metabolism by activating dehydrogenase enzymes critical to flux through the citric acid cycle. However, once Ca2+ signaling in the mitochondria passes a certain threshold, it stimulates the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis in part by collapsing the mitochondrial membrane potential required for metabolism. Studies examining the role of pro- and anti-apoptotic factors support this model; for example, the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 {{has been shown to}} interact with IP3Rs to reduce Ca2+ filling of the ER, leading to reduced <b>efflux</b> at the MAM and preventing collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential post-apoptotic stimuli. Given the need for such fine regulation of Ca2+ signaling, it is perhaps unsurprising that dysregulated mitochondrial Ca2+ has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, while the catalogue of tumor suppressors includes a few that are enriched at the MAM.|$|E

Previous {{studies have suggested}} that mineralization of phytodetritus accumulating each year on sediments might cause secondary contaminations of the overlying seawater (metal <b>effluxes).</b> The aim of the present research was to investigate these <b>effluxes</b> using a microcosm approach. Muddy sediments were placed in microcosms (diameter: 15  cm) and overlaid by phytodetritus (a mix of Phaeocystis globosa with the diatom Skeletonema costatum). The final suspension was 130. 6  mg L -  1 (dw) and the final chlorophyll a content was 750  ±  35  µg L -  1 (mean ± SD). Natural seawater was used for controls. Microcosms were then incubated in the dark at 15  °C during 7  days. Metals were monitored in overlying waters and microbial communities were followed using bacterial and nanoflagellate DAPI counts, thymidine incorporation, community level physiological profiling (CLPP) and fluorescein diacetate analysis (FDA). Benthic <b>effluxes</b> observed in sediments exposed to phytodetritus were always more elevated than those observed in controls. Large <b>effluxes</b> were observed for Mn, Co and As, reaching 1084  nmol m -  2  day -  1 (As), 512  nmol m -  2  day -  1 (Co), and 755  µmol m -  2  day -  1 (Mn).

An increased bacterial production was observed after two days (8. 7  mg C m -  2  day -  2) and the bacterial biomass appeared controlled by heterotrophic nanoflagellates.

The soil respiration rate of all the stands increased from March, followed by a peak in late July to August with temporal fluctuations, and then dramatically declined in September.

The soil total organic carbon (TOC), easily oxidizable organic C (EOC), microbial biomass C (MBC), and particulate organic C (POC) pools at depths ranging from 0 cm to 30 cm decreased within 68 years after tree planting. The TOC and its different components in the 0 cm to 10 cm soil layer were significantly and positively related with R-h and R-tot (p< 0. 01).

At capture, size-corrected TBW and ExNa pools in 62 crocodiles (hatchlings, juveniles, and subadults; weight, 0. 108 - 54. 4 kg) were independent of salinity history. To determine fluxes, all animals were released at their capture sites and left undisturbed until recapture. Thirty-seven were recaptured after 7 - 18 days. Fifteen of the 17 hatchlings recaptured from both salinity categories grew and maintained their condition and hydration status. In contrast, all 20 juveniles and subadults lost weight in the same period, and juveniles in hyperosmotic conditions showed significantly lower hydration and condition factors. Water <b>effluxes</b> in hatchlings were ~ 80 and ~ 160 ml kg- 0. 63 day- 1 in marine and brackish conditions, respectively. Comparable sodium <b>effluxes</b> were 7. 5 and 4. 4 mmol kg- 0. 63 day 1.

Sediment oxygen demand (SOD) and DIN <b>effluxes</b> were greatest during summer, but showed only a relatively small degree of seasonal variation. In contrast, {{there was a strong}} spatial trend in SOD and DIN <b>effluxes,</b> which were consistently greater at the sites with fine grained compared to the coarser sediments. Microphytobenthos (MPB) directly influenced SOD and DIN <b>effluxes,</b> with lower SOD and DIN <b>effluxes</b> measured during all light incubations. Strong correlations were found between sediment chlorophyll-a content and light–dark shifts in oxygen and ammonium fluxes (ΔO 2 and ΔNH 4 +), and between ΔO 2 and ΔNH 4 +. Rates of total nitrate reduction were relatively low ranging from 3 to 26 μmol N m− 2 h− 1 and exhibited only minor seasonal variations. Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) was the dominant pathway for nitrate reduction, accounting for on average, 65 and 68 % of total nitrate reduction during light and dark incubations, respectively. Nitrification was the dominant source of nitrate fuelling nitrate reduction processes, accounting for approximately 90 % of total nitrate supply.
