5000|$|Non-marine evaporites {{are usually}} {{composed}} of minerals {{that are not}} common in marine environments because in general the water from which non-marine evaporite precipitates has proportions of chemical elements different from {{those found in the}} marine environments. Common minerals that are found in these deposits include blödite, borax, epsomite, gaylussite, <b>glauberite,</b> mirabilite, thenardite and trona. Non-marine deposits may also contain halite, gypsum, and anhydrite, and may in some cases even be dominated by these minerals, although they did not come from ocean deposits. This, however, does not make non-marine deposits any less important; these deposits often help to paint a picture into past Earth climates. Some particular deposits even show important tectonic and climatic changes. These deposits also may contain important minerals that help in today's economy. Thick non-marine deposits that accumulate tend to form where evaporation rates will exceed the inflow rate, and where there is sufficient soluble supplies. The inflow also has to occur in a closed basin, or one with restricted outflow, so that the sediment has time to pool and form in a lake or other standing body of water. Primary examples of this are called [...] "saline lake deposits". Saline lakes includes things such as perennial lakes, which are lakes that are there year-round, playa lakes, which are lakes that appear only during certain seasons, or any other terms that are used to define places that hold standing bodies of water intermittently or year-round.

40|$|AbstractThe {{primary purpose}} of {{underground}} gas storages is to provide gas for seasonal consumptions or strategic reserve. The periodical operations of gas injection and extraction lead to cyclic loading {{on the walls and}} surrounding rocks of gas storages. To investigate the mechanical behaviors of different host rocks in bedded salt deposit, laboratory experiments were conducted on the samples of rock salt, thenardite, <b>glauberite</b> and gypsum. The mechanical properties of rock samples under monotonic and cyclic loadings were studied. Testing results show that, under monotonic loading, the uniaxial compressive stress (UCS) of <b>glauberite</b> is the largest (17. 3 MPa), while that of rock salt is the smallest (14. 0 MPa). The UCSs of thenardite and gypsum are 16. 3 and 14. 6 MPa, respectively. The maximum strain at the peak strength of rock salt (halite) is much greater than those of the other three rocks. The elastic moduli of halite, thenardite, <b>glauberite</b> and gypsum are 3. 0, 4. 2, 5. 1 and 6. 8 GPa, respectively. Under cyclic loading, the peak strengths of the rock specimens are deteriorated except for rock salt. The peak strengths of thenardite, <b>glauberite</b> and gypsum decrease by 33. 7 %, 19. 1 % and 35. 5 %, respectively; and the strains of the three rocks at the peak strengths are almost the same. However, the strain of rock salt at the peak strength increases by 1. 98 %, twice more than that under monotonic loading. Under monotonic loading, deformation of the tested rock salt, thenardite and <b>glauberite</b> shows in an elastoplastic style. However, it changes to a ductile style under cyclic loading.

40|$|Gypsum {{rocks are}} widely {{exploited}} {{in the world}} as industrial minerals. The purity of the gypsum rocks (percentage in gypsum mineral –CaSO 4 • 2 H 2 O- in the whole rock) is a critical factor to evaluate the potential exploitability of a gypsum deposit. It is considered than purities higher than 80 % in gypsum are required to be economically profitable. Gypsum deposits have been studied with geoelectrical methods; a direct relationship between the electrical resistivity values of the gypsum rocks and its lithological composition has been established, with the presence of lutites being the main controlling factor in the geoelectrical response of the deposit. This phenomenon has been quantified by means of a combination of theoretical calculations, laboratory measurements and field data acquisition. A geoelectrical classification of gypsum rocks defining three types of gypsum rocks has been elaborated. Anhydrite (CaSO 4) is frequently found in gypsum quarries and in no-outcropping sulphates. Because of its highest hardness than gypsum it supposes a problem for the extraction of gypsum; the fronts of the quarries in which anhydrite is found are stopped at the moment when it appears. The electrical properties of calcium sulphates have been studied by means of geoelectrical methods. The conductivity of crystals has been tested in laboratory. A direct relationship between the electrical conductivity values of the calcium sulphate rocks and its lithological composition has been established being the lutitic matrix the main controlling factor when it is percolant (connected at long range). When the rock is matrix dominant, the electrical resistivity trend is bond to the Hashin-Shtrikman lower bound for multiphase systems. On the other hand, when the rock is calcium sulphate dominant the trend shows the one of the Hashin-Shtrikman upper bound. A geoelectrical classification for calcium sulphate rocks has been elaborated. With this classification it is possible to differentiate between calcium sulphate rocks with different composition according to their electrical resistivity value. <b>Glauberite</b> (Na 2 Ca(SO 4) 2) is nowadays exploited as industrial mineral. <b>Glauberite</b> rocks usually have high lutite content in their composition, together with other evaporictic minerals as gypsum, anhydrite or halite among others. There is no reference to the conductivity of <b>glauberite</b> rocks in the bibliography, but due to their impurity it is expected to observe values as the observed for other sulphates in the matrix domain (less than 55 % in purity). Two areas of the Ebro river basin (the Zaragoza and La Rioja sectors) have been studied by means of electrical resistivity tomography profiles, in which <b>glauberite</b> has been found in boreholes. As example of application for the study of sulphate deposits, an electrical resistivity tomography survey has been carried out in the Pira Gypsum member (SE of Catalan margin of the Tertiary Ebro Basin, Spain). Additionally, a continuous coring drill was performed in order to support the study. Electrical imaging has been successfully applied to identify the gypsum deposits interlayered in lutite units. Another resistivity survey has been carried out in an active gypsum quarry in the Gelsa Gypsum unit (Zaragoza, N Spain). During the extraction of the rock, the most important parameters to know are the purity changes in the deposit. Sudden changes in the purity make the processing of the raw material less profitable. The performed profiles have shown different gypsum layers from which the purest layers have been identified. Electrical resistivity tomography lines are useful in prospection of gypsum deposits. However, electrical imaging prospection should be supported by an accurate petrological study of the deposits, in order to properly interpret the resistivity profiles.

When the β- anhydrite was mixed with water at a W/S (water/solid) ratio of 0. 54 in presence of different accelerators (CaO, mixture CaO - ash, ash, Na 2 SO 4 and K 2 SO 4), pastes were formed which hardened on standing.

40|$|The main {{processes}} {{controlling the}} hydrochemistry of an alluvium-covered evaporite karst area with high sinkhole risk (Ebro Valley, NE Spain) are examined {{by means of}} multivariate analyses (Principal Component Analysis and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis), ion correlations and geochemical speciation-solubility calculations. The hydrogeochemistry of the studied system seems to be governed by {{the interaction between the}} groundwater from the salt-bearing evaporitic karst aquifer and from the overlying Ebro River alluvial aquifer. The observed hydrochemical features in the alluvial-karst aquifer system are mainly determined by the relative contribution of gypsum/anhydrite and halite dissolution, showing a wide spectrum from relatively fresh recharge waters (mainly irrigation waters) to highly evolved groundwater from the evaporitic aquifer. The variability of these contributions is especially evident at sinkhole ponds which, in some cases, seem to be associated with discharge areas of the karst aquifer in the valley bottom alluvium. Calculated saturation indexes suggest that, in contrast to gypsum, the amounts of halite in the sampled portions of evaporitic aquifer are not large enough to attain equilibrium, which is consistent with the predominance of gypsum/anhydrite reported for these materials. Furthermore, the observed Na:Cl and Ca:SO 4 correlations and stoichiometries suggest that other possible processes, such as <b>glauberite</b> dissolution or Na/Ca-exchange, generally play a minor role (compared to halite and gypsum dissolution) in this system. Another important process in the system is the dissolution of carbonate minerals (dolomite and, possibly, calcite) fostered by the input of CO 2 (g), which is probably produced by pedogenic processes. Dolomite dissolution seems to be particularly relevant in the evaporitic materials probably due to dedolomitisation triggered by gypsum/anhydrite dissolution...|$|E

This core, spanning a time of 17 000 years, was unique in that it possessed an entire range of salinity from freshwater clays and silty sands at the bottom to gypsum and <b>glauberite</b> in the middle, to halite at the top. Bacterial and archaeal communities were studied {{along the length of}} this core using an integrated approach combining mineralogy and geochemistry, molecular microbiology (16 S rRNA gene analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction), cultivation and lipid biomarker analyses. Systematic changes in microbial community composition were correlated with the salinity gradient, but not with mineralogy. Bacterial community was dominated by the Firmicutes-related environmental sequences and known species (including sulfate-reducing bacteria) in the freshwater sediments at the bottom, but by halophilic and halotolerant Betaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes in the hypersaline sediments at the top. Succession of proteobacterial groups along the salinity gradient, typically observed in free-living bacterial communities, was not observed in the sediment-associated community. Among Archaea, the Crenarchaeota were predominant in the bottom freshwater sediments, but the halophilic Halobacteriales of the Euryarchaeota was the most important group in the hypersaline sediments. Multiple isolates were obtained along the whole length of the core, and their salinity tolerance was consistent with the geochemical conditions. Iron-reducing bacteria were isolated in the freshwater sediments, which were capable of reducing structural Fe(III) in the Fe(III) -rich clay minerals predominant in the source sediment.

Using electron microprobe analysis and Raman spectroscopy, the following crystalline phases were identified. Silicate minerals are represented by potassium feldspar, pectolite [NaCa 2 Si 3 O 8 (OH) ], and phlogopite. The most abundant minerals {{in the majority of}} inclusions are sulfates: glaserite (aphthitalite) [K 3 Na(SO 4) 2], <b>glauberite</b> [Na 2 Ca(SO 4) 2], aluminum sulfate, anhydrite (CaSO 4), gypsum (CaSO 4 * 2 H 2 O), barite (BaSO 4), bloedite [Na 2 Mg(SO 4) 2 * 4 H 2 O], thenardite (Na 2 SO 4), polyhalite [K 2 Ca 2 Mg(SO 4) 4 * 2 H 2 O], arcanite (K 2 SO 4), and celestite (SrSO 4). In addition, apatite was detected in some inclusions. Chlorides are probably present among small crystalline phases, because some analyses of aggregates of silicate and sulfate minerals showed up to 0. 19 – 10. 3 wt % Cl. Hydrogen was identified in the gas phase of polyphase inclusions by Raman spectroscopy. The composition of melt from which the chrome diopside crystallized was calculated {{on the basis of the}} investigation of silicate melt inclusions. This melt contains 53. 5 wt % SiO 2, considerable amounts of CaO (16. 3 wt %), K 2 O (7. 9 wt %), Na 2 O (3. 5 wt %), and SO 3 (1. 4 wt %) and moderate amounts of Al 2 O 3 (7. 5 wt %), MgO (5. 8 wt %), FeO (1. 1 wt %), and H 2 O (0. 75 wt %). The content of Cr 2 O 3 in the melt was 0. 13 wt %. Many inclusions were homogenized at 770 - 850 oC, when all of the crystals and the gas phase were dissolved. The material of inclusions heated up to the homogenization temperature became heterogeneous even during very fast quenching (two seconds) producing numerous small crystals. This fact implies that most of the inclusions contained a salt (rather than silicate) melt of sulfate-dominated composition. Such inclusions were formed from salt globules (with a density of about 2. 5 g/cm 3) occurring as an emulsion in the denser (2. 6 g/cm 3) silicate melt from which the chrome diopside crystallized...|$|E
40|$|ES] La Cuenca de Madrid presenta un registro de sistemas lacustres bien desarrollados a 10 largo del Mioceno. Los depósitos correspondientes a estos sistemas lacustres quedan integrados en tres unidades tectosedimentarias mayores reconocibles a 10 largo de la mayor parte de la cuenca. La Unidad Inferior o Salina esta constituidapor depósitos caracteristicos de sistemas lacustres evaporiticos con salmueras de naturaleza sulfatada-clorurada sódica. Dichos sistemas lacustres cerrados tuvieron un carácter perenne, {{en conjunto}} muy somero, con un episodio Último que favoreció el depósito de thenardita. La Unidad Intermedia contiene depósitos carbonatados y yesiferos correspondientes a sistemas lacustres salinos más diluidos, presentando una distribución de facies netamente controlada por la heterogeneidad litológica de 10 s bordes de la cuenca. Dicha unidad culmina con un extens 0 desarrollo de sistemas lacustres, reflejando un episodio de endulzamiento de 10 s cuerpos de agua lacustres, posiblemente controlado por factores paleoclimáticos. La Unidad Superior presenta un mosaic 0 heterogéneo de sistemas fluvio-lacustres con amplio desarrollo de facies tobáceas y acumulaciones de oncoides, reflejando en conjunto un periodo de fitoproducción intensa. El control paleomorfológico sobre el desarrollo de estas facies aparece ligado a un contexto exorreic 0 que marca una diferenciación evolutiva clara en relación con las unidades miocenas previas. Este episodio Último culmina la evolución desde sistemas lacustres netamente evaporiticos a sistemas predominantemente carbonatados. Dicha evolución es discutida en términos de agotamiento en el aporte de solutos, variación en las condiciones climáticas y funcionamiento tectosedimentario. [EN] The sedimentological {{analysis}} of lake deposits of the Madrid Basin in central Spain provides evidence of outstanding {{changes in the}} sedimentary lacustrine record throughout the Miocene. The Madrid Basin {{is one of the}} three most important Tertiary continental depressions in the interior of the Iberian Peninsula. It was filled by up to 3, 500 m of tertiary sedimentary successions, from wich near one third corresponds to miocene deposits. The Miocene record is made up of three main tectono-sedimentary units each of them containing well developed lacustrine formations. The Lower or Saline Unit is characterized by saline deposits where anhydrite, magnesite, halite, fine clastics as well as significant deposits of <b>glauberite</b> and thenardite forn the commonly observedfacies associations. The sequential arrangement of these facies may be interpreted as characteristic of highly saline, perennial lakes that were developed in a closed basin. The evaporites deposited in these lakes are thought to be mostly derived from Paleogene and Mesozoic formations extended to the East of the Basin, through recycling of evaporite units occurring in these formations. The Intermediate Unit is made up of a rather monotonous sequence of carbonate and gypsum deposits, the latter having been more widely developed in central and easterly areas of the basin. A complex mosaic of marginal lacustrine facies can be recognized in response both to varied depositional regimes of the associated alluvial systems and source areas. Economic sepiolite and ccbentoniten deposits, micaceous sandstones, carbonates (dolostones andlimestones), detrital gypsum, and chert form the characteristic facies of the lake margins. Central lake facies mainly consist of massive beds of chemically precipitated as well as detrital gypsum which are usually interbedded with carbonates and thin mudstone beds. In general, the lacustrine facies of the Intermediate Unit were deposited in a shallow, perennial, moderately diluted lake under semiarid climaticediment conditions. This pattern changed towards the top of the Unit (Lower Vallesian), where a shifting towards wetter and colder conditions can be recorded. Lacustrine deposits developed in this terminal stage are dominated by fresh-water carbonates as well as slightly deeper lake facies in most of the region. The Upper Unit of the Miocene is composed of clastic and freshwater carbonate deposits that overlie a complex paleokarst surface in northern and central parts of the basin. The analysis of the stratigraphic relationship between sediments belonging to the Upper Unit and underlying formations leads to conclude that paleomorphological heterogenities within the basin strongly controlled the sedimentation in this period. Travertines and oncoid limestones werelargely formed from dissolution of underlying karstified carbonates and gypsum, their deposition taking place in river-related marshes, shallo,w lakes and springs. The evolution of the lacustrine systems in the Madrid Basin throughout the Miocene is clearly indicative of the exhaustion of a prima 1. y evaporite basin through more and more dilute stages unti 1 a net fresh-water episode {{at the top of the}} Tertiary sequence. The process was, in general, governed by the tectonic behaviour of the basin margins, which controlled the recycling of source evaporite formalions, though climate could also influence episodically this pattern. It is suggested that the basin underment a dramatic change from closed geomorphic and hidrologic conditions to exorheism since the upper Vallesian.
