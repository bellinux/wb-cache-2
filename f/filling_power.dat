50|$|This is the 'classic' Mamod {{model and}} has been in {{production}} with minor updates and modifications for nearly 50 years. It is a model of a typical traction engine with a full-length canopy. The engine itself is an oscillating-cylinder unit, the same as the SR1/a which is based on the old MM2 unit. The boiler is longer than that on the SR1 although it is the same volume internally. The front part is an empty void into which, in the earlier versions, the exhaust steam was fed through the choke (it controlled the exiting steam not the inlet steam). The TE1a differs from the TE1 in having a reversing lever to control the speed and direction of the model, initially used on the MEC1 of 1965 and subsequently applied to the TE in 1967, whereas the TE1 was unidirectional only with an exhaust 'choke' to control the speed. The TE1 was claimed to cover a third of a mile in ten minutes on a single <b>filling.</b> <b>Power</b> is delivered to the back axle by means of a drive band running from a small pulley on the flywheel to the rim of one of the back wheels. This can be removed to allow the engine to run stationary or to drive a lineshaft and tools. The front axle of the model is mounted on a central pivot with a simple copper stub spring which provides a crude form of suspension. It is also steerable, by means of a shaft running from the axle up inside the chimney (later models post 67). Early models did not use the later control rod for steering but used a rod mounted directly into a hole in the early model square axle box. Both designs could be screwed down to lock the wheels in a fixed position. A control rod can be attached to the top of this shaft with a wooden handle on top to allow the operator to steer the model as it moves. The TE1/A has a green boiler (this green has varied over the years from apple green to a dark brunswick green, similar to GWR locomotives), red spoked wheels and flywheel, a white/cream coloured canopy and a black firebox/smokebox/chimney. It is also available in a distinctive alternative paint scheme, with a polished brass boiler and maroon wheels. Other limited edition models have been produced in the last decade using blue or black paint work as well of variations of the colours mentioned already.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{irrigation}} with saline water on quality of Burley tobacco (cv. C 104) {{was investigated in}} Southern Italy over four consecutive years. A rainfed control (RC) was compared with treatments irrigated with volumes equal to crop evapotranspiration of saline waters at 0. 5 (NW), 2. 5 (SW 1), 5 (SW 2) and 10 (SW 3) dSm 1 electrical conductivity (ECw). In 2000 and 2001 an additional salinity treatment (15 dS m 1 ECw) was included (SW 4). The amounts of Cl added to the soil by irrigation ranged from 36. 3 kg ha 1 (good quality water in 1999) to 16. 2 Mg ha 1 (saline water at 15 dS m 1 ECw in 2000). Saline irrigation did not affect yield and yield components of cured leaves. In 1998 and 1999 the <b>filling</b> <b>power</b> of Burley tobacco did not change significantly with increasing salinity of the irrigation water. In 2000 and 2001 the <b>filling</b> <b>power</b> of SW 2, SW 3 and SW 4 treatments was significantly {{less than that of}} NW. The Cl content of tobacco grown with SW 2 was significantly greater than that grown with NWand there were no differences between SW 1 through SW 4 treatments. The <b>filling</b> <b>power</b> and the leaf Cl content were inversely related to the amount of Cl applied in the range between 40. 3 kg ha 1 and 5. 1 Mg ha 1. The <b>filling</b> <b>power</b> decreased and Cl increased up to the SW 2 treatment; beyond that level neither Cl nor <b>filling</b> <b>power</b> changed in response to increasing amounts of Cl applied. The leaf alkaloid content was unaffected by salinity. Total N was unaffected by either the growing season or the saline treatments. Cigarettes obtained from saline treatments did not burn during the smoking test in 1998. In 1999 cigarettes made from SW 1 and SW 2 did burn, but those from SW 3 did not.

40|$|Abstract—A {{cooperative}} power scheduling algorithm devel-oped by Wang, Krunz and Cui {{is extended}} for {{an ad hoc}} network of MIMO links. This algorithm, referred to as price-based iterative water filling (PIWF) algorithm, is a distributed algorithm by which each link computes its power scheduling through an iterative and cooperative process. The cooperation among all links is achieved by adaptive price factors applied by each link. Compared to a centralized power scheduling algorithm, the PIWF algorithm is much more efficient in computation although not as efficient in network throughput. Compared to a non-cooperative counter-part by Demirkol and Ingram where all price factors are zero, the PIWF algorithm requires additional in-network computation but is more efficient in network throughput.

In addition, products labeled as [...] "Goose Down" [...] must contain at least 90% goose down, 10% goose feathers. [...] Down insulation is rated by <b>fill</b> <b>power,</b> which {{is the number of}} cubic inches displaced by a given ounce of down (in3/oz).

Down rated 500-650 in3/oz (290-375 cm3/g) is warm enough and light enough for most conditions, and 800-900 in3/oz (460-520 cm3/g) fill is used for very lightweight and/or very cold-weather gear.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the problem of}} optimal power control for delay-constrained {{communication}} over fading channels. Our objective {{is to find a}} power control law that optimizes the link layer performance, specifically, minimizes delay bound violation probability (or equivalently, the packet drop probability), subject to constraints on average power, arrival rate, and delay bound. The transmission buffer size is assumed to be finite; hence, when the buffer is full, there will be packet drop. The fading channel under our study has a continuous state, e. g., Rayleigh fading. Since directly solving the power control problem (which optimizes the link layer performance) is particularly challenging, we decompose it into three subproblems, and solve the three sub-problems iteratively; we call the resulting scheme Joint Queue Length Aware (JQLA) power control, which produces a local optimal solution to the three subproblems. We prove that the solution that simultaneously solves the three sub-problems is also an optimal solution to the optimal power control problem. Simulation results show that the JQLA scheme achieves superior performance over the time domain water filling and the truncated channel inversion power control. E. g., JQLA achieves 10 dB gain at packet drop probability of 10 − 3, over the time domain water <b>filling</b> <b>power</b> control...|$|E

40|$|Because of {{a number}} of {{exceptional}} properties over mineral oil, ester fluids are now being used in more medium and large power transformers. At the same time, there are significant differences in the dielectric & thermal properties and other material parameters, between mineral oil and ester fluids, which need to be considered in the design, manufacture, retro – filling, and service of these transformers. This paper presents results of investigations, calculations, and measurements made to identify the special material characteristics that need to be considered when designing the core and windings of these transformers. The paper also presents the factors that must be considered in the selection, design, and determination of the voltage and current ratings of bushings and tap – changers to be used in ester fluid – <b>filled</b> <b>power</b> transformers. In addition, the paper identifies properties of ester fluids that would require different procedures in the processing of th e fluid during manufacture and impregnation of the solid insulation in the transformer. The factors that should be considered when an old mineral oil – <b>filled</b> <b>power</b> transformer is to be retro – filled with an ester fluid are presented. These allow the transformer to benefit from the advantages of the ester fluid but not negatively impact its performance and reliability during future years of service. During transformer service, some oil quality parameters of ester fluids; such as power factor, acidity, interfacial tension, etc do not reflect the same correlation to fluid dielectric or thermal performance as they do in mineral oil. Also, some diagnostic parameters which determine the condition of the solid insulation in a mineral oil - <b>filled</b> <b>power</b> transformers will need to be considered differently in relationship to the different properties of ester fluids.

Two irrigation methods (drip and furrow) and six irrigation treatments (rainfed control, RC; fully-irrigated with water at 0. 5 dS m- 1 electrical conductivity (ECw), NW; at 2. 5 dS m- 1 ECw, SW 1; at 5 dS m- 1 ECw, SW 2; 10 dS m- 1 ECw, SW 3; at 15 dS m- 1 ECw, SW 4) were factorially combined.
