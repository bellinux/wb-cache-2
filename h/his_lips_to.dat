5|$|As a child Juha Vainio was {{diagnosed}} with congenital heart disease, causing <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>to</b> turn blue, and the onset of rapid breathlessness. He underwent a heart operation in early 1949 {{at the same time}} as his mother suffered an attack of tuberculosis from which she later recovered. Juha was at first kept in the adults' ward due to the serious nature of the operation, but later transferred to the children's ward to recover. He soon went home and began to get better.|$|E
500|$|The Russian {{characters}} {{from the start}} of the episode came from a [...] "great" [...] Russian acting community in Vancouver, British Columbia who had defected from the Soviet Union. Both Lea and Laurie Holden were required to learn Russian for the first scene following the opening credits. Alex Shostak Jr., who portrayed Dmitri, worked 12â€“14 hours a day; make-up was applied to give the appearance that his eyes and mouth had been sewed up, and a small straw was pushed between <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>to</b> give him water. During the filming of the episode, he was [...] "literally" [...] blind and guided by the crew members throughout the filming of his scenes. Shostak provided the translation for his own lines from English to Russian. Holden and Lea worked diligently together to perfect their lines in Russian. Holden explained, [...] "we'd come up with these fun ways to test ourselves to know if we had really nailed it. Show tunes come to mind, but I also remember this one time my dialect coach had me call a Russian friend of his on his cell phone to see if he could understand me. I passed the test." ...|$|E
60|$|Telford {{bent and}} pressed <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>to</b> Min's pain-blanched mouth.|$|E
60|$|He frowned a little, and bit <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> <b>to</b> {{check the}} rough word {{that was on}} the tip of his tongue.|$|R
60|$|Cochrane {{shrugged his}} shoulders. Privations {{had made him}} irritable, and he had <b>to</b> bite <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> <b>to</b> keep down a bitter answer. He walked slowly away, with his straight-legged {{military}} stride.|$|R
6000|$|David {{closed his}} ears against the {{juvenile}} pack, whose yell just then rang shrilly through the forest; and Duncan, suffering <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> <b>to</b> curl, as in mockery {{of his own}} superstition, said firmly: ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was another}} short silence, which {{presently}} Bill opened <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>to</b> break.|$|E
60|$|The {{newcomer}} opened <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>to</b> protest, but Sir Edward {{held out}} his hand.|$|E
60|$|At {{these words}} Hugh flushed red with joy, and opened <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>to</b> speak.|$|E
60|$|It was {{impossible}} for the visitor to see the speaker; but he knew from the voice that the words were uttered by a girl, and his face reddened, as he bit <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> <b>to</b> hold back a retort.|$|R
6000|$|Eachin bit <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> <b>to</b> {{suppress}} <b>his</b> irritated {{feelings as}} he replied: [...] "Words--words--empty words, father Simon. You fear the Clan Quhele {{more than you}} love them, and you suppose their indignation would be formidable should their chief marry {{the daughter of a}} burgess of Perth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} that is going too far. We are bound to hear what he has to say." [...] Cochrane shrugged his shoulders. Privations had made him irritable, and he had <b>to</b> bite <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> <b>to</b> keep down a bitter answer. He walked slowly away, with his straight-legged {{military}} stride.|$|R
60|$|Martin looked {{with admiration}} on her glowing face, and pressed <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>to</b> hers.|$|E
60|$|Morris ran {{his fingers}} through his untidy hair and opened <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>to</b> answer.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Finch rose to {{show the}} way. Her husband opened <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>to</b> interfere.|$|E
6000|$|Charles bit <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> <b>to</b> {{keep himself}} from smiling. [...] "Buckingham," [...] he said, [...] "this is a foolish business; {{and we must}} not forget (as we have nearly done), {{that we have an}} {{audience}} to witness this scene, and should walk the stage with dignity. I will show you your fault in private." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Besides which,' said Ralph, {{suffering}} <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> <b>to</b> curl into a smile, 'you haven't {{the money}} about you, and you weren't prepared for this, or you'd have brought it with you; and there's nobody you'd {{so much like}} to accommodate as me. I see. We trust each other in about an equal degree. Are you ready?' ...|$|R
60|$|Wilding bowed, <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> tight <b>to</b> keep in {{the anger}} that craved expression. Then, without another word spoken, he turned and departed.|$|R
60|$|SERGEANT. He 'as not opened <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>to</b> my knowledge, Your Worship, {{from that}} hour to this.|$|E
60|$|He opened <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>to</b> speak {{but stopped}} short. It {{was obvious that}} she was deeply in earnest.|$|E
60|$|His partner {{looked at}} him, pursed up <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>to</b> whistle, then remembered {{and shook his}} head instead.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Sabin looked up, and <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> seemed <b>to</b> move, {{but he said}} nothing. Mr. Brott felt {{perhaps that}} he was on {{difficult}} ground.|$|R
60|$|The man {{shook his}} head. Speech {{of any sort}} was difficult. Even with <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> close <b>to</b> the other's ears, he had almost to shout.|$|R
60|$|Gillie nodded, with <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> tightly {{compressed}} <b>to</b> check utterance.|$|R
60|$|Captain Bervie opened <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>to</b> {{continue}} his inquiries--turned pale--and checked himself. Mr. Linwood put the next question.|$|E
60|$|At {{this point}} Allan opened <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>to</b> interrupt, and was himself {{interrupted}} {{before he could}} utter a word.|$|E
60|$|She rose, too, and {{her arms}} went round his neck. She drew <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>to</b> hers and kissed him.|$|E
6000|$|... [STRANGWAY in {{his dark}} clothes has entered, and stands by the [...] door, <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> {{compressed}} <b>to</b> a colourless line, his thin, [...] darkish face grey-white] ...|$|R
60|$|The {{nearness}} to her bred a madness, and {{he touched}} <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> lightly <b>to</b> the same white little toe that {{had won the}} Baron Courbertin a kiss.|$|R
60|$|There was one dreadful {{moment of}} silence. He still held his arms round my neck, {{and on a}} sudden he put <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> close <b>to</b> my ear.|$|R
60|$|At that dreadful little saying, Winton {{leaned forward}} and put <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>to</b> her hand, that lay outside the clothes.|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} did not wait for a second invitation, but gently touched <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>to</b> their soft young cheeks.|$|E
60|$|He pressed <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> <b>to</b> hers; {{he breathed}} over her a {{thousand}} blessings; {{she felt his}} tears trickling on her neck.|$|E
6000|$|He turn'd <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> <b>to</b> hers, {{and with}} his hand [...] Call'd back the tangles of her {{wandering}} hair; [...] Even then their love they could not all command, [...] And half forgot their danger and despair: [...] Antonia's patience now was at a stand-- [...] 'Come, come, 't is no time now for fooling there,' [...] She whisper'd, in great wrath--'I must deposit [...] This pretty gentleman within the closet: ...|$|R
60|$|The Skimmer scarce {{deemed it}} {{necessary}} to conceal the contempt that caused <b>his</b> <b>lip</b> <b>to</b> curl, while the other was endeavoring to mystify his cupidity; and when the speaker was done, he merely expressed an assent by a slight inclination of the head. The ex-governor saw that his attempt was fruitless, and, by relinquishing his masquerade, and yielding more to his natural propensities and tastes, he succeeded better.|$|R
60|$|He uttered this {{supposition}} in so earnest a {{tone that}} I could not refrain from smiling. He left off biting <b>his</b> lower <b>lip</b> <b>to</b> apostrophize me.|$|R
