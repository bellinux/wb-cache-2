5|$|After the battle, the {{captured}} German panzerarmee general Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma told Montgomery {{that he had}} believed the Allies {{had at least one}} more armoured division than they did, and that the attack would be in the south. Rommel's stand-in, general Georg Stumme, thought the attack would not begin for several weeks. Bertram had thus succeeded in all <b>its</b> <b>objectives.</b> Announcing the victory at El Alamein in the House of Commons, Winston Churchill praised the camouflage operation.|$|E
5|$|Claymore {{took place}} on 4 March 1941. The Germans were caught {{unprepared}} and the landings were unopposed.

An added bonus were the 315 Norwegian volunteers brought back to join the Free Norwegian Forces.|$|E

5|$|In September 1995 the House National Security Subcommittee on Military Personnel, {{chaired by}} Bob Dornan, {{requested}} that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) conduct its own investigation into the shootdown incident.

5|$|The {{offensive}} achieved <b>its</b> <b>objectives,</b> {{and significantly}} contributed, along with Operations Sana and Maestral 2 to forcing the Bosnian Serb leadership to serious peace negotiations.

5|$|These events worried Greek Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, {{as well as}} the {{possibility}} that the unstable situation could spill over outside Albania, triggering a wider conflict.

The provisional government formally ceased to exist, declaring that it had accomplished <b>its</b> <b>objectives.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the battle, the {{captured}} German panzerarmee general Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma told Montgomery {{that he had}} believed the allies {{had at least one}} more armoured division than they did, and that the attack would be in the south. Rommel's stand-in, general Georg Stumme, thought the attack would not begin for several weeks. German documents and prisoners of war confirmed that the German commanders had believed in the existence of the decoy unit, and had not anticipated the true avenue of attack. Bertram had succeeded in all <b>its</b> <b>objectives.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{two weeks}} {{out of the}} line, the {{division}} attacked the Hindenburg Line itself on 29 September, easily achieving <b>its</b> <b>objectives</b> and capturing 1,000 prisoners. With the New Zealanders on the St. Quentin Canal and the adjacent Scheldt River, a platoon had managed to cross it and reach the village of Crèvecœur. However, it became pinned down until the 1st Auckland and 2nd Wellington Battalions of the 1st Brigade managed to cross {{the next day and}} capture the village. Private James Crichton, a member of the trapped platoon, earned the VC, the last of the war for the New Zealand Division, for his efforts in relaying messages between his companions and his company commander. He also defused demolition charges on the bridge spanning the Scheldt River.|$|E

5|$|Aiming {{to knock}} Turkey {{out of the}} war the British then decided to stage an amphibious {{lodgement}} at Gallipoli and following a period of training and reorganisation the Australians were included amongst the British, Indian and French forces committed to the campaign. The combined Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC)—commanded by British general William Birdwood—subsequently landed at Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli peninsula on 25 April 1915. Although promising to transform the war if successful, the Gallipoli Campaign was ill-conceived and ultimately lasted eight months of bloody stalemate, without achieving <b>its</b> <b>objectives.</b> Australian casualties totalled 26,111, including 8,141 killed.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{studies to}} grow the Mercury {{spacecraft}} capabilities to long-duration flights, developing space rendezvous techniques, and precision Earth landing, Project Gemini was started as a two-man program in 1962 to overcome the Soviets' lead and to support the Apollo manned lunar landing program, adding extravehicular activity (EVA) and rendezvous and docking to <b>its</b> <b>objectives.</b> The first manned Gemini flight, Gemini 3, was flown by Gus Grissom and John Young on March 23, 1965. Nine missions followed in 1965 and 1966, demonstrating an endurance mission of nearly fourteen days, rendezvous, docking, and practical EVA, and gathering medical data {{on the effects of}} weightlessness on humans.|$|E

Clinton was troubled by the plight of women she encountered, but found a warm response from the people of the countries she visited and gained a better relationship with the American press corps. The trip was a transformative experience for her and presaged her eventual career in diplomacy.|$|E

5|$|Despite several counterattacks {{during the}} afternoon, the New Zealanders {{managed to hold}} their front line, {{including}} the village of Flers, although both flanks remained exposed due {{to the failure of}} 41st and 47th Divisions to reach or hold their frontage of the Blue Line. It was a successful day for the division; it had captured the most ground of all the divisions of XV Corps involved in the battle. It had also reached all four of <b>its</b> <b>objectives</b> although it ended the day in possession of three plus Flers itself, which was actually in 41st Division's sector.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} {{surrender}} of Nazi Germany on May 8, 1945, plans were underway for the largest operation of the Pacific War, Operation Downfall, the invasion of Japan. The operation had two parts: Operation Olympic and Operation Coronet. Set to begin in October 1945, Olympic involved a series of landings by the U.S. Sixth Army intended to capture the southern third of the southernmost main Japanese island, Kyūshū. Operation Olympic was to be followed in March 1946 by Operation Coronet, the capture of the Kantō Plain, near Tokyo on the main Japanese island of Honshū by the U.S. First, Eighth and Tenth Armies, {{as well as a}} Commonwealth Corps made up of Australian, British and Canadian divisions. The target date was chosen to allow for Olympic to complete <b>its</b> <b>objectives,</b> for troops to be redeployed from Europe, and the Japanese winter to pass.|$|E
5|$|In July 1956, Nasser {{unilaterally}} nationalised the Suez Canal. The {{response of}} Anthony Eden, who had succeeded Churchill as Prime Minister, was to collude with France to engineer an Israeli attack on Egypt {{that would give}} Britain and France an excuse to intervene militarily and retake the canal. Eden infuriated US President Dwight D. Eisenhower, by his lack of consultation, and Eisenhower refused to back the invasion. Another of Eisenhower's concerns was {{the possibility of a}} wider war with the Soviet Union after it threatened to intervene on the Egyptian side. Eisenhower applied financial leverage by threatening to sell US reserves of the British pound and thereby precipitate a collapse of the British currency. Though the invasion force was militarily successful in <b>its</b> <b>objectives,</b> UN intervention and US pressure forced Britain into a humiliating withdrawal of its forces, and Eden resigned.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{scholarly}} reception {{has considered}} The Shortest Way in negative terms, as a failed satire, or as using irony so slight {{as to be}} undetectable. Such a conclusion cites the contemporary reaction to the work, how it failed to deliver <b>its</b> <b>objectives</b> and also caused its author such problems. If critics have offered praise, it {{is the extent to}} which Defoe managed to impersonate the style of his subjects, so as to be indistinguishable from them. The Shortest Way is frequently contrasted with another work of irony in the eighteenth century, which is considered to have succeeded in its use of the device, Jonathan Swift's A Modest Proposal (1729).|$|E
5|$|On 19 and 20 October, the 4th Armoured Brigade was {{involved}} in its first action as a brigade in an attack towards the Savio River, with the 20th Armoured Regiment on the left flank. This was primarily a tank action, in contrast to previous battles in which the armour supported the infantry. Having advanced seven miles to complete <b>its</b> <b>objectives,</b> the regiment supported the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade in making its own attack across the river {{on the evening of}} 21 October. The regiment's Shermans fired an hour-long barrage of high explosive shells along their front to create a diversion, under the cover of which the Canadians made their own landings on the far bank of the Savio.|$|E
5|$|Rubinstein's {{first step}} was to found the Russian Musical Society (RMS) in 1859. <b>Its</b> <b>objectives</b> were to educate people in music, {{cultivate}} their musical tastes and develop their talents in that area of their lives. The first priority of the RMS acted was to expose to the public the music of native composers. In addition to a considerable amount of Western European music, works by Mussorgsky and Cui were premiered by the RMS under Rubinstein's baton. A few weeks after the Society's premiere concert, Rubinstein started organizing music classes, which were open to everyone. Interest in these classes grew until Rubinstein founded the Saint Petersburg Conservatory in 1862.|$|E
