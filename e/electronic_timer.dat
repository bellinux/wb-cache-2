5|$|A {{personal}} dive {{computer is}} a small computer designed to be worn by a diver during a dive, with a pressure sensor and an <b>electronic</b> <b>timer</b> mounted in a waterproof and pressure resistant housing which has been programmed to model the inert gas loading of the diver's tissues in real time during a dive. A display allows the diver to see critical data during the dive, including the maximum and current depth, duration of the dive, and decompression data including the remaining no decompression limit calculated in real time for the diver throughout the dive. The dive computer keeps track of residual gas loading for each tissue used in the algorithm. Dive computers also provide a measure of safety for divers who accidentally dive a different profile to that originally planned. Most dive computers will provide the necessary decompression information for acceptably safe ascent {{in the event that}} the no-decompression limits are exceeded. The use of computers to manage recreational dive decompression is becoming the standard and their use is also common in occupational scientific diving. Their value in surface supplied commercial diving is more restricted, but they can usefully serve as a dive profile recorder.|$|E
25|$|A {{circuit board}} fragment, {{allegedly}} found {{embedded in a}} piece of charred material, was identified as part of an <b>electronic</b> <b>timer</b> similar to one found on a Libyan intelligence agent who had been arrested 10 months previously for carrying materials for a Semtex bomb. The timer was allegedly traced through its Swiss manufacturer, Mebo, to the Libyan military, and Mebo employee Ulrich Lumpert identified the fragment at al-Megrahi's trial. Mebo's owner, Edwin Bollier, testified at the trial that the Scottish police had originally shown him a fragment of a brown 8-ply circuit board from a prototype timer which had never been supplied to Libya. Yet the sample he was asked to identify at the trial was a green 9-ply circuit board that Mebo had indeed supplied to Libya. Bollier wanted to pursue this discrepancy, but was told by trial judge Lord Sutherland that he could not do so. Bollier later claimed that in 1991 he had declined an offer of $4million from the FBI in exchange for his support of the main line of inquiry, though this claim has never been verified.|$|E
25|$|Sprinkler {{irrigation}} {{involves the}} installation {{of a series of}} sprinkler units throughout the vineyard, often spaced as several rows about 65 feet (20m) apart. The sprinklers can be set on an <b>electronic</b> <b>timer</b> and release predetermined amount of water for a set period of time. While this provides more control and uses less water than flood irrigation, like furrow irrigation the amount that each individual wine receives can be sporadic. The irrigation system that provides the most control over water management, though conversely the most expensive to install, is drip irrigation. This system involved long plastic water supply lines that run down each row of vines in the vineyard with each individual grape vine having its own individual dripper. With this system, a viticulturist can control the precise amount of water that each grapevine gets down to the drop. An adaption of this system, potentially useful in areas where irrigation may be banned, is underground subirrigation where precise measurements of water is delivered directly to the root system.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 12 million pencil {{detonators}} {{were produced}} in Britain during the war. However, {{in recent years}} they have been superseded by <b>electronic</b> <b>timers</b> which are more accurate and provide much longer delay times. Interestingly, pencil detonators are by nature completely immune to detection or jamming via electronic countermeasures or EMP devices - unlike <b>electronic</b> <b>timers.</b> For this reason they may still have applicability in special situations.|$|R

25|$|The EDS was {{distributed}} throughout the vehicle and includes some components in the IU. There were nine EDS rate gyros installed at location 15 in the IU. Three gyros monitored {{each of the three}} axes (pitch, roll and yaw), providing triple redundancy. The control signal processor (location 15) provided power to and received inputs from the nine EDS rate gyros. These inputs were processed and sent to the EDS distributor (location 14) and to the flight control computer (location 16). The EDS distributor served as a junction box and switching device to furnish the spacecraft display panels with emergency signals if emergency conditions existed. It also contained relay and diode logic for the automatic abort sequence. An <b>electronic</b> <b>timer</b> (location 17) was activated at liftoff and 30 seconds later energized relays in the EDS distributor which allowed multiple engine shutdown. This function was inhibited during the first 30 seconds of launch, to preclude the vehicle falling back into the launch area. While the automatic abort was inhibited, the flight crew can initiate a manual abort if an angular-overrate or two-engine-out condition arose.|$|E
500|$|The {{personal}} decompression computer, or dive computer, {{is a small}} computer {{designed to}} be worn by a diver during a dive, with a pressure sensor and an <b>electronic</b> <b>timer</b> mounted in a waterproof and pressure resistant housing and which has been programmed to model the inert gas loading of the diver's tissues in real time during a dive. Most are wrist mounted, but a few are mounted in a console with the submersible pressure gauge and possibly other instruments. A display allows the diver to see critical data during the dive, including the maximum and current depth, duration of the dive, and decompression data including the remaining no decompression limit calculated in real time for the diver throughout the dive. Other data such as water temperature and cylinder pressure are also sometimes displayed. The dive computer has the advantages of monitoring the actual dive, {{as opposed to the}} planned dive, and does not assume on a [...] "square profile" [...] â€“ it dynamically calculates the real profile of pressure exposure in real time, and keeps track of residual gas loading for each tissue used in the algorithm.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2008 {{the members}} of the Penygraog Homing Society Racing Pigeon Club in Wales won an award to fund a new {{electronic}} timing device.

50|$|Street light {{controllers}} are smarter {{versions of}} the mechanical or <b>electronic</b> <b>timers</b> previously used for street light ON-OFF operation. They come with energy conservation options like twilight saving, staggering or dimming. Also many street light controllers come with an astronomical clock for a particular location or a Global Positioning System (GPS) connection to give the best ON-OFF time and energy saving.|$|R
50|$|In the past, these {{electromechanical}} timers {{were often}} combined with electrical relays to create electro-mechanical controllers. Electromechanical timers reached a high state {{of development in}} the 1950s and 1960s because of their extensive use in aerospace and weapons systems. Programmable electromechanical timers controlled launch sequence events in early rockets and ballistic missiles. As digital electronics has progressed and dropped in price, <b>electronic</b> <b>timers</b> have become more advantageous.|$|R
50|$|Among {{applications}} are lighting (interior, exterior, and street lighting), cooking {{devices such as}} ovens, washing machines, and heating and cooling of buildings and vehicles. Built-in automatic washing machine controllers are examples of very complex electromechanical and <b>electronic</b> <b>timers</b> cycles, starting and stopping many processes including pumps and valves to fill and empty the drum with water, heating, and rotating at different speeds, with different combinations of settings for different fabrics.|$|R

50|$|An <b>electronic</b> <b>timer</b> allow simple push-buttons to be used. One timer is {{installed}} controlling {{the lights and}} any number of push-buttons, without pneumatic timers and connected in parallel, are used to trigger it. With many push-buttons, the cost savings for equipment may be substantial.|$|E
50|$|Shooters are timed using <b>electronic</b> <b>timers</b> which {{record the}} {{duration}} for each stage to one hundredth of a second. The timer starts when the Range Officer pushes the button which beeps to {{signal that the}} shooter may proceed. The timer has a built-in microphone and records the time when each loud noise (shot) happens. When {{there is no more}} noise, the timer continues to display the final time which is the raw score.|$|R
50|$|PIR sensors {{may be used}} {{to control}} {{lighting}} in such areas. They avoid the need to press a push-button but otherwise operate as for <b>electronic</b> <b>timers.</b> As PIR sensors are not perfectly reliable a timer is needed to avoid the lights flashing off and on as the occupier moves out of detector range. The timer interval is short though compared to a push-button timer; it times the interval between sightings of the occupier, not the time of occupancy.|$|R
40|$|An {{automated}} Robinson light-trap {{design is}} described and its performance assessed {{after more than}} 2000 hours of use (700 trap-nights). The design is modular and is appropriate to synchronised sampling studies over multiple and (especially) remote sites. Series of traps {{can also be used}} to partition sampling over successive time intervals at single sites, e. g., time periods throughout the night. The <b>electronic</b> <b>timers</b> confer high operational flexiblity and the light + baffle module is readily adaptable to alternative design specifications...|$|R
50|$|The time {{of flight}} of an {{ultrasonic}} pulse that has been transmitted through the material is measured using an <b>electronic</b> <b>timer</b> that determines {{the start of the}} transmitted pulse and the start of the received pulse using threshold detection. This timer is typically accurate to microsecond or better resolution.|$|E
50|$|The enlarger's lamp or shutter {{mechanism}} is controlled either by an <b>electronic</b> <b>timer,</b> {{or by the}} operator - who marks time with a clock, metronome or simply by counting seconds - shuttering or turning off the lamp when the exposure is complete. The exposed paper can be processed immediately or placed in a light-tight container for later processing.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning {{a barrel}} race, {{the horse and}} rider will enter the arena at top speed, through the center {{entrance}} (or alley if in a rodeo arena).

50|$|VCR started gaining {{mass market}} {{traction}} in 1975. Six major firms {{were involved in}} the development of the VCR: RCA, JVC, AMPEX, Matsushita Electric / Panasonic, Sony, and Toshiba. Of these, the big winners in the growth of this industry were Japanese companies Matsushita Electric / Panasonic, JVC, and Sony, which developed more technically advanced machines with more accurate <b>electronic</b> <b>timers</b> and greater tape duration. The VCR started to become a mass market consumer product; by 1979 there were three competing technical standards using mutually incompatible tape cassettes.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the NFL Scouting Combine, Johnson was {{projected}} as a second- to third-round {{draft pick}} in the 2008 NFL Draft. However, at the combine he registered a time of 4.24 seconds and broke the all-time mark set by Rondel Menendez, a wide receiver from Eastern Kentucky, in 1999â€”the first year the combine used <b>electronic</b> <b>timers</b> (his record was later broken by John Ross in 2017 {{with a time of}} 4.22). Johnson was also fifth highest among running backs in the vertical jump with a 35-inch jump. His 10-foot, 10-inch broad jump was third best among the running backs.|$|R
5000|$|Analog {{television}} cameras scan an {{image as a}} series of horizontal lines that are stacked vertically to form a grid or [...] "frame". The camera's progression through the frame is carefully controlled by <b>electronic</b> <b>timers,</b> known as time base generators, that produce smoothly increasing voltages. As the camera scans the image, the brightness of the location currently being scanned is also represented as a voltage. The series of varying voltages from the sensor forms an amplitude modulated (AM) signal that encodes the brightness variations along any given scan line, and spikes in the signal indicate when the line or frame changes.|$|R

50|$|On {{the early}} {{electromechanical}} timers, the motor ran {{at a constant}} speed throughout the wash cycle, although {{it was possible for}} the user to truncate parts of the program by manually advancing the control dial. However, by the 1950s demand for greater flexibility in the wash cycle led to the introduction of more sophisticated electrical timers to supplement the electromechanical timer. These newer timers enabled greater variation in functions such as the wash time. With this arrangement, the electric timer motor is periodically switched off to permit the clothing to soak, and is only re-energized just prior to a micro-switch being engaged or disengaged for the next stage of the process. Fully <b>electronic</b> <b>timers</b> did not become widespread until decades later.|$|R

50|$|Electronic timers are {{essentially}} quartz clocks with special electronics, and can achieve higher precision than mechanical timers. Electronic timers have digital electronics, but {{may have an}} analog or digital display. Integrated circuits have made digital logic so inexpensive that an <b>electronic</b> <b>timer</b> is now less expensive than many mechanical and electromechanical timers.

50|$|On 28 August, {{technicians}} at the Naval Weapons Support Center at Crane, Indiana {{confirmed the}} FBI's conclusion that an <b>electronic</b> <b>timer,</b> batteries, and/or a primer {{were not involved}} in the explosion. Subsequently, Miceli's team announced that a chemicalâ€”not electricalâ€”ignition device had been used to cause the explosion, but the new conclusion was not included in Milligan's report before the report was released. On 11 August 1989 the Navy, acting on a recommendation from Miceli, recertified the Iowa-class battleship's 16 in guns for operation.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a computerized <b>electronic</b> counter and <b>timer</b> using LCD monitor to be used in cashierâ€™s office of Naval State University, Naval, Biliran, Philippines. This study used the application rapid development as a tool in making the project. The Computerized <b>Electronic</b> Counter and <b>Timer</b> Using LCD Monitor was designed to ease the effort and boredoms of the students falling in line waiting for their turn to be entertain by the cashier in whatsoever purposes they have. It is a great help to the administrator in making the students entertain while they are waiting for their turn. It may also be a venture for the administrator to post important announcements to the students. Computerized <b>Electronic</b> Counter and <b>Timer</b> Using LCD Monitor was design taking into account various industry needs and practices. The system is an ideal solution for one service environment such as the cashier, thus optimizing the space and enhancing the office operational efficiency. Computerized <b>Electronic</b> Counter and <b>Timer</b> Using LCD Monitor is a simple and user friendly system which has teller button service whereby the teller/agent instantly calls the next customer in the queue. This system is also equipped with a ticketing dispenser, and display units alerting the customer to proceed to the available counter, video player for the customer to be entertain while waiting, and a moving text to post important announcements. Moreover, more than one single line queue systems can also be integrated together allowing more tellerâ€™s/agents to serve increasing customers. This system allows us to enhance the customer experience in any environment. There is a need of future study to enhance the implementation of this system...|$|R
500|$|Titterton {{then became}} {{involved}} with timing circuits used to track the progress of an implosion. Along with Frisch, Darol Froman, Rudolf Peierls, Philip Moon and Alvin C. Graves, he developed the [...] "pin method". Pins were placed near the implosion and connected to circuits which connected to an oscilloscope. This gave accurate timing of the implosion, from which its symmetry could be evaluated. It {{turned out to be}} the most useful of several methods of timing the implosion. When the director, Robert Oppenheimer, reorganised the Los Alamos Laboratory to focus on implosion in August 1944, Titterton joined Kenneth Greisen's X-1A Section in Norris Bradbury's X-1 (Implosion) Group. The group studied the timing of the primacord detonations using X-rays. Titterton designed a circuit for measuring the spread of detonations using a variation of the pin method. He developed a device called [...] "the informer" [...] that measured the time spread among detonations (and whether all the detonators had indeed fired). In July 1945 he was a senior member of the timing group at the Trinity nuclear test that fired the first nuclear weapon at Alamogordo, New Mexico. His <b>electronic</b> <b>timers</b> tracked the progress of the detonation. In February 1946, he became the head of the P-1 (Electronics) Group. He participated in the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll, and performed the countdown for both tests.|$|R
