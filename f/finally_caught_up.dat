5|$|Rising anxiety {{levels in}} the white {{settlers}} caused Captain James W. Stephenson to gather 12 volunteers and move toward {{the area of the}} disturbances from Galena. Stephenson recruited more men at Apple River Fort and then traveled eastward. Stephenson and his men rose before dawn on June 18 and started following the trail of the band of Sauk who had stolen the horses. The militia marched through pounding rain before they <b>finally</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> with the Sauk.|$|E
5|$|Teammate {{and quarterback}} Benny Lom chased Riegels, {{screaming}} {{at him to}} stop. Known for his speed, Lom <b>finally</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> with Riegels at California's 3-yard line and tried to turn him around, but he was immediately hit by a wave of Tech players and tackled back to the 1-yard line. The Bears chose to punt rather than risk a play so close to their own end zone, but Tech's Vance Maree blocked Lom's punt for a safety, giving Georgia Tech a 2–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Wisconsin Heights was the {{penultimate}} {{engagement of}} the 1832 Black Hawk War, fought between the United States state militia and allies, and the Sauk and Fox tribes, led by Black Hawk. The battle {{took place in}} what is now Dane County, near present-day Sauk City, Wisconsin. Despite being vastly outnumbered and sustaining heavy casualties, Black Hawk's warriors managed to delay the combined government forces long enough to allow the majority of the Sauk and Fox civilians in the group to escape across the Wisconsin River. This reprieve was temporary; when the militia <b>finally</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> with the fleeing band it resulted in the Bad Axe massacre {{at the mouth of the}} Bad Axe River.|$|E
5000|$|Kahn {{loved the}} visual effects of Maine's coastline. In the late 1960s {{after a number}} of {{vacations}} on Deer Isle, Maine, the foggy conditions ultimately led to a significant shift in Kahn's painting. Years of monochromatic work concentrated on varying tonalities finally gave way to intense color. Kahn recalled later, [...] "I began to let the color come through on my canvases...my pastels were always intense, and <b>finally</b> my painting <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> with them." ...|$|R
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with MTV News in November 2009, Clarkson stated that while performing on the All I Ever Wanted Tour, she would also be {{in the process of}} writing new material for her fifth studio album, which she hoped for a late 2010 release. Later, during the Chart Show TV, Clarkson revealed that she wanted to do something different for the album. Her label felt the same way. On March 4, 2010, Clarkson was announced to perform on the revived Lilith Fair music festival. However, low ticket sales and scheduling conflicts led Clarkson and Norah Jones to cancel their upcoming performances. Clarkson remarked she would focus on recording for her upcoming album instead. Clarkson took a six-month break from her music career in 2010. Clarkson, who had a hectic schedule following the release of her sophomore album Breakaway, admitted that her music career had a bad effect on her health, saying [...] "Because my career went from zero to 100, there was no 'growing'. I learnt well under pressure, but, like, four years passed by and I hit rock bottom, Breakaway just exploded everywhere. Everyone was making a lot of money, so everyone was pushing the train. That's when it <b>finally</b> all <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> with me. I came down with 'walking pneumonia' {{for the second time in}} a year. My body was physically giving up. I took six months off and went home. I love working, but at the end of the day you've got to take care of yourself." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1893 an Englishman {{arrived in}} Rossport. He {{appeared}} to be wealthy and told people he was Allan Sutherland, Captain of the Argyll Highlanders and the 5th Lancers. He had an entourage of servants and workers with him - game keepers, dogs, guns, meat, fish, whiskey, wine and fishing tackle. When he went into Belmullet the shopkeepers all gave him credit so delighted with their distinguished guest as they were. Mr. Allan Sutherland borrowed everywhere he went and paid nobody. He always seemed to have forgotten his cheque book. He bought horses locally which he kept on a trial basis but in reality he sold them to Dublin for £10 each. He lived in Rossport House even though the Bournes family in London did not want him there. He had found the property in the Field magazine but he never paid the Bournes a penny of rental. <b>Finally</b> the law <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> {{with him and he}} was sentenced to seven-years' penal servitude for horse stealing and other offences. He pleaded guilty to all the charges. It was disclosed in court that he had received a legacy of over £4,000 and had squandered the lot on horses and gambling.|$|R
5|$|With the {{exception}} of Villeneuve's fugitives, the French Mediterranean Fleet had been annihilated. Nine of eleven ships of the line had been captured or destroyed, {{as well as two}} frigates. French casualties totalled more than 3,000 and possibly as many as 5,000, compared to British losses of 218 killed and 677 wounded. However, many of Nelson's ships were seriously damaged, and urgent repairs were required for both his own ships and the captured prizes before they could begin the long voyage back to Britain. For more than two weeks Nelson remained in Aboukir Bay, effecting repairs, writing despatches and assessing the strategic situation in Egypt. The first ship detached from his squadron was Leander, sent on 5 August to the fleet under Earl St. Vincent off Cadiz with reports of the battle. On 8 August Aboukir Island was stormed and captured, and on 12 August Emerald, Alcmene and Bonne Citoyenne <b>finally</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> with the fleet, followed on 17 August by Seahorse and Terpsichore. Mutine was detached on 13 August with despatches for the Admiralty and on 14 August Nelson sent seven ships with the six seaworthy prizes to the mouth of Aboukir Bay under the command of Saumarez. This convoy sailed for Gibraltar on 15 August and the following day Nelson burnt Heureux, followed on 18 August by Mercure and Guerrier, none of which were fit for continued service. On 19 August Nelson separated his remaining ships, leading three vessels northwards towards Naples and leaving a blockade squadron off Alexandria of Zealous, Goliath, Swiftsure and the frigates, under Captain Samuel Hood.|$|E

50|$|Vidocq {{returned}} to Arras in 1800. His {{father had died}} in 1799, so he hid in his mother's house for almost half a year before he was recognized and had to flee again. He assumed the identity of an Austrian and {{spent some time in}} a relationship with a widow, with whom he moved to Rouen in 1802. Vidocq built up a reputation as a businessman and finally felt secure enough to let his mother come live with him and the widow; but <b>finally,</b> his past <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> with him. He was arrested and brought to Louvres. There, he learned that he had been sentenced to death in absentia. With the help of the local procurator-general, Ransom, he filed an appeal and spent the following five months in prison waiting for a retrial. During this time, Louise Chevalier contacted him to inform him of their divorce. When it seemed {{that there would be no}} decision concerning his sentence, he decided to flee again. On 28 November 1805, while unattended for a moment, he jumped out of a window into the adjacent river Scarpe. For the next four years, he was a man on the run once again.|$|R

We curate what we like, share the works of other people, be it our friends or George Takei’s latest post. Where has our creativity gone?

50|$|Finally on Timun Mas' 17th birthday, Butho Ijo {{appeared}} at Mbok Srini's house to take Timun Mas as promised: he will eat the girl. Mbok Srini ordered Timun Mas {{to run for}} her life. Timun Mas was really scared and terrified and ran {{as fast as she}} can to try to escape the giant. The giant was furious and destroyed Mbok Srini's house while chasing Timun Mas. <b>Finally,</b> Butho Ijo <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> to the fleeing Timun Mas. In distress, Timun Mas opened one of her four cloth bags spreading cucumber seeds behind her. Suddenly a large cucumber vine appeared and strangled the giant's body, trapping him so that he can’t move. This gave Timun Mas time to escape further. However the powerful giant finally managed to break free and continued his chase. Timun Mas opened her second bag and spread needles behind her. Suddenly the needles transformed into a bamboo forest with sharp tips that wounded the giant badly. The giant was badly wounded stuck with sharp bamboos, however he managed to get through the sharp bamboo forest and <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> to the running Timun Mas again. She opened her third bag and spread salts behind her back. Suddenly a sea appeared behind her drowning the evil giant. However the giant managed to swim through the sea and continued to chase her. Timun Mas, once again, almost got caught and opened her last bag. She threw the terasi behind her and continued to run desperately. Suddenly the terasi shrimp paste transformed into sea of boiling volcanic mud. Butho Ijo was stuck inside the boiling hot mud, drowned and died. Timun Mas finally survived and return to her mother Mbok Srini, and they lived happily ever after.|$|R

25|$|The {{following}} year Cork {{had the opportunity}} of capturing a record-equaling fourth successive All-Ireland.

25|$|In 1931, though already forty-eight - an age {{at which}} most cricketers even in that era had already retired - Charlie Parker equalled Jack Hearne's record of taking 100 wickets by 12 June and his total {{aggregate}} was the second highest of his career. However, age <b>finally</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> with Parker in 1932 after a promising beginning. Though he still spun the ball considerably, he lost his accuracy of length and consequently was expensive. Because Gloucestershire had no support for him and Goddard, Parker continued to play until 1935, but never recovered his former powers.|$|E

25|$|While {{the first}} two full seasons in Hartford were not {{glittering}} (the Whalers recorded losing records both years), the final two WHA seasons saw more success. They went to the finals again in 1978, with a veteran team spearheaded by the Howes–50-year-old Gordie led the team in scoring—future NHL stars Gordie Roberts and Mike Rogers, All-Star defenseman Ron Plumb, and forwards John McKenzie, Dave Keon and Mike Antonovich, and possessed of the league's best defense.

25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the race, Henri and Francis Pélissier were the best. They both finished before the rest in stage two, with Henri crossing the line first. In the third stage, Henri, leading the race, wanted to stop. Organizer Desgrange did all he could to change Pélissier's mind, and finally Pélissier started to race again. He was already 45 minutes behind, and the next three hours he was chasing the rest. He <b>finally</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up,</b> and finished second in the sprint, after his brother Francis.

Three new songs were recorded but were never fully finished and were soon shelved. The second attempt at reformation was in 2008 with the lineup of Biro, Norton, Seanheist and Dedman rehearsing some old songs and jamming new material a handful of times. Personality clashes, old grievances and just bad timing just made the reformation impossible to go ahead. In 2012 All five members of the band from the IRCR line-up <b>finally</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> and met at the album's 10 year Anniversary party at Norton’s bar (Whole Lotta Love) in Melbourne, talks of reforming were once again on the table, but nothing eventuated.|$|E
