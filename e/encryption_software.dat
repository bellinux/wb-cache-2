25|$|New {{versions}} of PGP are released periodically and vulnerabilities are fixed by developers {{as they come}} to light. Any agency wanting to read PGP messages would probably use easier means than standard cryptanalysis, e.g. rubber-hose cryptanalysis or black-bag cryptanalysis (e.g. installing some form of trojan horse or keystroke logging software/hardware on the target computer to capture encrypted keyrings and their passwords). The FBI has already used this attack against PGP in its investigations. However, any such vulnerabilities apply not just to PGP but to any conventional <b>encryption</b> <b>software.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Network {{encryption}} cracking is the breaching {{of network}} encryptions (e.g., WEP, WPA, ...), usually {{through the use}} of a special <b>encryption</b> cracking <b>software.</b> It may be done through a range of attacks (active and passive) including injecting traffic, decrypting traffic, and dictionary-based attacks.|$|R

25|$|Information security, {{sometimes}} shortened to InfoSec, is {{the practice}} of preventing unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, inspection, recording or destruction of information. It is a general term {{that can be used}} regardless of the form the data may take (e.g. electronic, physical). The chief area of concern for the field of information security is the balanced protection of the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability of data, also known as the CIA Triad, while maintaining a focus on efficient policy implementation and no major hampering of organization productivity. To standardize this discipline, academics and professionals collaborate and seek to set basic guidelines and policies on password, antivirus software, firewall, <b>encryption</b> <b>software,</b> legal liability and user/administrator training standards.|$|E
25|$|Zimmermann {{challenged}} {{these regulations}} in an imaginative way. He published the entire source code of PGP in a hardback book, via MIT Press, which was distributed and sold widely. Anybody wishing {{to build their}} own copy of PGP could cut off the covers, separate the pages, and scan them using an OCR program (or conceivably enter it as a type-in program if OCR software was not available), creating a set of source code text files. One could then build the application using the freely available GNU Compiler Collection. PGP would thus be available anywhere in the world. The claimed principle was simple: export of munitions—guns, bombs, planes, and software—was (and remains) restricted; but the export of books is protected by the First Amendment. The question was never tested in court with respect to PGP. In cases addressing other <b>encryption</b> <b>software,</b> however, two federal appeals courts have established the rule that cryptographic software source code is speech protected by the First Amendment (the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Bernstein case and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Junger case).|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, in February 2008, a {{group of}} {{security}} researchers published details of a so-called [...] "cold boot attack" [...] that allows full disk encryption systems such as BitLocker to be compromised by booting the machine off removable media, such as a USB drive, into another operating system, then dumping the contents of pre-boot memory. The attack relies {{on the fact that}} DRAM retains information for up to several minutes (or even longer if cooled) after power has been removed. There is the Bress/Menz device described in US Patent 9,514,789 that can accomplish this type of attack. Use of a TPM alone does not offer any protection, as the keys are held in memory while Windows is running. Similar full disk encryption mechanisms of other vendors and other operating systems, including Linux and Mac OS X, are vulnerable to the same attack. The authors recommend that computers be powered down when not in physical control of the owner (rather than be left in a sleep mode) and that the <b>encryption</b> <b>software</b> be configured to require a password to boot the machine.|$|E

In the paper first, the basic SSPG architecture and algorithm are recalled. Then, the software implementation in Visual C++ environment is presented. Finally, the results of some images and texts, encrypted with SSPG sequence, are discussed. The proposed algorithm is suitable for fast <b>software</b> <b>encryption</b> because it allows generating uniform, scalable and unpredictable pseudo random sequences with large period...|$|R

40|$|Networks are {{protected}} using many firewalls and <b>encryption</b> <b>software’s.</b> But {{many of them}} are not sufficient and effective. Therefore an intrusion detection system (IDS) is required that monitors the network, detects misbehavior or anomalies and notifies other nodes in the network to avoid or punish the misbehaving nodes. Numerous schemes have been proposed for Intrusion Detection and Response Systems, for Ad hoc networks. The ultimate goal of the security solutions for wireless networks is to provide security services, such as authentication, confidentiality, integrity, anonymity, and availability, to mobile users. In this paper, we examine the vulnerabilities of wireless networks and argue that we must include intrusion detection in the security architecture for mobile computing environment. We propose an mIDS (Mobile Intrusion Detection System) suitable for multi-hop ad-hoc wireless networks, which detects nodes misbehavior, anomalies in packet forwarding, such as intermediate nodes dropping or delaying packets. mIDS does rely on overhearing packet transmissions of neighboring nodes. Simple rules are designed to identify the misbehavior nodes. A special node called a monitor node carries out the process of identifying the misbehavior node. 1...|$|R
