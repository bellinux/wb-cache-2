2500|$|As soon as {{the victory}} of the Popular Front in the {{elections}} became known I, already an elect member of Parliament, showed up at the prison of Oviedo the next morning, went {{to the office of the}} Director, who had fled in a mad panic because he had behaved like a genuine criminal toward the Asturian prisoners interned after the revolution of October 1934, and there I found the Administrator to whom I said, [...] "Give me the keys because the prisoners must be released this very day." [...] He replied, [...] "I have not received any orders", and I answered, [...] "I am a member of the Republic's Parliament, and I demand that you hand over the keys immediately to set the prisoners free." [...] He handed them over and I assure you that it was the most thrilling day of my activist life, opening the cells and shouting, [...] "Comrades, everyone get out!" [...] Truly thrilling. I did not wait for Parliament to sit or for the release order to be given. <b>I</b> <b>reasoned,</b> [...] "We have run on the promise of freedom for the prisoners of the revolution of 1934—we won—today the prisoners go free." ...|$|E

"If homicides in New York went undiscovered, <b>I</b> <b>reasoned,</b> {{although}} the best detective talent {{was employed to}} ferret them out, it must be true that the detectives went about their work in the wrong way.

60|$|I {{considered}} the matter. The word of honor {{of a fellow}} such as he was could not be worth much, but the merest chance {{of getting rid of}} tramps should not be neglected.

With my two dogs and my pony, and riding a horse I had managed to capture, I crossed the San Joaquin {{and went on to}} a {{wonderful}} valley in the Sierras called Yosemite. In the great hotel there I found a prodigious supply of tinned provisions. The pasture was abundant, as was the game, and the river that ran through the valley was full of trout. I remained there three years in an utter loneliness that none but a man who has once been highly civilized can understand. Then I could stand it no more. I felt that I was going crazy. Like the dog, I was a social animal and I needed my kind. <b>I</b> <b>reasoned</b> that since I had survived the plague, there was a possibility that others had survived.

6000|$|In this, doubtless, <b>I</b> <b>reasoned</b> like a {{young and}} inexperienced writer, besotted with his own fancies; and my presumptuous trespasses into this sacred, though neglected, region of history have met with {{deserved}} rebuke from men of soberer minds.

60|$|But I was soft-hearted, and, so, <b>I</b> <b>reasoned</b> with her; yet in {{a manner}} that was to leave her no doubt of the true nature of her situation, and the need to use me with a little {{courtesy}} for the sake of what I might yet do, if she lacked the grace to treat me with gratitude for the sake of that which I had done already.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of one option can entail the {{performance of}} another. For instance, I {{have the option of}} baking a pumpkin pie as well as the option of baking a pie, and the former entails the latter. Now, suppose that <b>I</b> have both <b>reason</b> to bake a pie and reason to bake a pumpkin pie. This raises the question: Which, if either, is more fundamental than the other? Do <b>I</b> have <b>reason</b> to bake a pie because <b>I</b> have <b>reason</b> to perform some instance of pie-baking—perhaps, pumpkin-pie baking? Or do <b>I</b> have <b>reason</b> to bake a pumpkin pie because <b>I</b> have <b>reason</b> to bake a pie? Or are they equally fundamental, as they would be if, say, <b>I</b> had <b>reason</b> to do each because each would have optimal consequences? The aim {{of this paper is to}} compare two possible answers to this question—omnism and maximalism—and to argue that the latter is preferable. Roughly speaking, maximalism is the view that only those options that are not entailed by any other option are to be assessed in terms of whether they have some feature (such as that of having optimal consequences), whereas omnism is the view that all options are to be assessed in terms of whether they have this feature. I argue that there are at least two reasons to prefer maximalism, for it is able to overcome two critical problems with omnism...|$|R
