40|$|We have {{isolated}} a genomic locus from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) {{cells that}} contains a full-length provirus. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicates {{that it is a}} defective member of the rodent type C retrovirus family with an env region that is similar to those of mouse amphotropic retrovirus and subgroup B feline leukemia virus. We were able to demonstrate that this provirus is a member of a closely related family of full-length proviruses in CHO cells and Chinese hamster liver. Hybridization probes generated from this genomic clone were used to characterize type C retrovirus RNA expression in CHO cells. Full-length genomic RNA and subgenomic envelope mRNA were detected in CHO cell lines but not in the human-derived 293 cell line. Interestingly, we discovered that the site of retrovirus integration lies within a G repeat sequence belonging to the short interspersed element family of retroposons. Since their development in the 1950 s, CHO cells have been used extensively for genetic studies (see reference 13). Re-cently, CHO cells have been used to manufacture recombinant protein therapeutics (7, 11, 18, 33). Several features make the CHO cell culture system a suitable choice for the manufacture of recombinant protein therapeutics (<b>for</b> <b>discussions,</b> <b>see</b> ref...|$|E
