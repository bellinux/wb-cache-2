5|$|At {{the turn}} of the century as {{telephone}} lines became available, it became popular to add telegraph onto telephone lines with an <b>earth</b> <b>return</b> phantom circuit. An LC filter was required to prevent telegraph clicks being heard on the telephone line. From the 1920s onwards, telephone lines, or balanced lines dedicated to the purpose, were used for FDM telegraph at audio frequencies. The first of these systems in the UK was a Siemens and Halske installation between London and Manchester. GEC and AT also had FDM systems. Separate pairs were used for the send and receive signals. The Siemens and GEC systems had six channels of telegraph in each direction, the AT system had twelve. All of these systems used electronic oscillators to generate a different carrier for each telegraph signal and required a bank of band-pass filters to separate out the multiplexed signal at the receiving end.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} telephones used telegraph lines, or open-wire single-wire <b>earth</b> <b>return</b> circuits.

25|$|In single-wire <b>earth</b> <b>return</b> (SWER) AC {{electrical}} distribution systems, {{costs are}} saved by using {{just a single}} high voltage conductor for the power grid, while routing the AC return current through the earth.

500|$|The Paddington to West Drayton {{telegraph}} originally used six wires {{rather than}} five, {{although it was}} a five-needle system. [...] The sixth wire was to provide a common return so that the needles could be operated independently, thus giving the possibility of more available codes. [...] Using these codes, however, would have required more extensive operator training since the display could not be read on sight from the grid as the simple alphabetic codes were. [...] Telegraph systems were later to use <b>earth</b> <b>return</b> to avoid the need for a return wire, but this [...] principle was not established at the time of Cooke and Wheatstone's telegraph. [...] The economic need {{to reduce the number of}} wires in the end proved a stronger incentive than simplicity of use and led Cooke and Wheatstone to develop the two-needle telegraph.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "stray voltage" [...] is {{used for}} the {{gradient}} (rate of change with respect to distance) of electrical potential in the surface of the soil, associated with single-wire <b>earth</b> <b>return</b> electricity distribution systems used in some rural locations.

2500|$|Electrical {{circuits}} may {{be connected}} to ground (earth) for several reasons. [...] In mains powered equipment, exposed metal parts are connected to ground to prevent user contact with dangerous voltage when electrical insulation fails. [...] In electrical power distribution systems, a protective ground conductor {{is an essential part}} of the safety earthing system. [...] Connection to ground also limits the build-up of static electricity when handling flammable products or electrostatic-sensitive devices. In some telegraph and power transmission circuits, the earth itself can be used as one conductor of the circuit, saving the cost of installing a separate return conductor (see single-wire <b>earth</b> <b>return).</b>|$|E
