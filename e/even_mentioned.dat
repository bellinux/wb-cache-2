5|$|In 1931, Prince Nicholas eloped with Ioana Doletti, a {{divorced}} woman. Marie strongly disapproved of her son's actions and felt hurt by Doletti's repeated attempts to keep Nicholas from communicating with his mother. Although she blamed {{the women in}} her sons' lives for a while, she also came to blame herself, for failing to educate them properly. However, she stubbornly and continually refused to meet Magda Lupescu, even after Carol's pleas. Until her last years, Marie seldom <b>even</b> <b>mentioned</b> Lupescu's name.|$|E
5|$|Despite lack of run support {{contributing}} to a poor win-loss record, Hamels was among the best pitchers in the National League, and was <b>even</b> <b>mentioned</b> as a Cy Young candidate. On September 1, Hamels pitched six innings of a Phillies combined no-hitter against the Atlanta Braves. Hamels was pulled for a pinch hitter {{in the top of}} the seventh due to having five walks, a hit-batter, and 108 pitches through six innings. Overall, Hamels was the only consistent star on the Phillies, finished sixth in Cy Young voting, and was frequently mentioned as a candidate to be traded in the offseason to bolster the Phillies' lackluster farm system, after he avoided being dealt at the July trading deadline.|$|E

5|$|Although Chang'an was {{the capital}} of the earlier Han and Jin dynasties, after {{subsequent}} destruction in warfare, it was the Sui dynasty model that comprised the Tang era capital. The roughly square dimensions of the city had six miles (10km) of outer walls running east to west, and more than five miles (8km) of outer walls running north to south. The royal palace, the Taiji Palace, stood north of the city's central axis. From the large Mingde Gates located mid-center of the main southern wall, a wide city avenue stretched from there all the way north to the central administrative city, behind which was the Chentian Gate of the royal palace, or Imperial City. Intersecting this were fourteen main streets running east to west, while eleven main streets ran north to south. These main intersecting roads formed 108 rectangular wards with walls and four gates each, and each ward filled with multiple city blocks. The city was made famous for this checkerboard pattern of main roads with walled and gated districts, its layout <b>even</b> <b>mentioned</b> in one of Du Fu's poems. During the Heian period, the city of Heian kyō (present-day Kyoto) of Japan like many cities was arranged in the checkerboard street grid pattern of the Tang capital and in accordance with traditional geomancy following the model of Chang'an. Of these 108 wards in Chang'an, two of them (each the size of two regular city wards) were designated as government-supervised markets, and other space reserved for temples, gardens, ponds, etc. Throughout the entire city, there were 111 Buddhist monasteries, 41 Daoist abbeys, 38 family shrines, 2 official temples, 7 churches of foreign religions, 10 city wards with provincial transmission offices, 12 major inns, and 6 graveyards. Some city wards were literally filled with open public playing fields or the backyards of lavish mansions for playing horse polo and cuju football. In 662, Emperor Gaozong moved the imperial court to the Daming Palace, which became the political center of the empire and served as the royal residence of the Tang emperors for more than 220 years.|$|E

25|$|Beer was {{the major}} {{beverage}} among the Babylonians, and as early as 2700 BC they worshiped a wine goddess and other wine deities. Babylonians regularly used both beer and wine as offerings to their gods. Around 1750 BC, the famous Code of Hammurabi devoted attention to alcohol. However, there were no penalties for drunkenness; in fact, it was not <b>even</b> <b>mentioned.</b> The concern was fair commerce in alcohol. Although {{it was not a}} crime, the Babylonians were critical of drunkenness.|$|E
25|$|K. A.

The civilisation, known as the Nartec, tell their own tale as to how they came to be under the sea, but although Marco jokingly suggests that the group have discovered Atlantis, the name never appears. After the Animorphs make their escape, the Nartec do not appear or are <b>even</b> <b>mentioned</b> in later novels, leaving their fate undetermined.|$|E

25|$|While {{attending}} undergraduate {{school in}} Rochester, New York, in 1839, classmates Clarke and Morton apparently participated in ether frolics with some regularity. In January 1842, by now {{a medical student}} at Berkshire Medical College, Clarke administered ether to a Miss Hobbie, while Elijah Pope performed a dental extraction. In so doing, {{he became the first}} to administer an inhaled anesthetic to facilitate the performance of a surgical procedure. Clarke apparently thought little of his accomplishment, and chose neither to publish nor to pursue this technique any further. Indeed, this event is not <b>even</b> <b>mentioned</b> in Clarke's biography.|$|E
25|$|An {{independent}} theatre {{company called}} Fancy Bred Theatre produced a special reading of Resurrection Blues as a fundraiser for the Actors' Fund of Canada, in February 2009, in Winnipeg, Canada. The reading was staged {{in a very}} physically animated style, and it ran for three nights before 180 people. The production, featuring many well-known professional local artists, focused mainly on the comedy and absurdities of the script. Audience reception was overall very positive, and the production was a great success. Some audience members <b>even</b> <b>mentioned</b> that the wordy script worked much better in a reading than in a fully mounted show.|$|E
25|$|It {{could be}} argued that at his peak, Fulci's fame and {{popularity}} were on a par with that of Dario Argento, another famous Italian horror film director whom Fulci had avoided working with as a result of Fulci publicly criticizing Argento from time to time. Fulci was most likely resentful of Argento since Argento had always received critical acclaim and recognition in Italy and abroad, whereas Fulci had been regarded there as something of a horror film hack. Fulci always joked that when he died, the Italian newspapers would all misspell his name, if they <b>even</b> <b>mentioned</b> him at all.|$|E

25|$|For {{longitudinal}} waves such as {{sound waves}} in fluids, {{the direction of}} oscillation is by definition along the direction of travel, so the issue of polarization is not normally <b>even</b> <b>mentioned.</b> On the other hand, sound waves in a bulk solid can be transverse as well as longitudinal, {{for a total of}} three polarization components. In this case, the transverse polarization is associated with the direction of the shear stress and displacement in directions perpendicular to the propagation direction, while the longitudinal polarization describes compression of the solid and vibration along the direction of propagation. The differential propagation of transverse and longitudinal polarizations is important in seismology.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1949, {{movie theater}} {{operator}} United Paramount Theatres (UPT) was forced by the U.S. Supreme Court to become an independent entity, separating itself from Paramount Pictures. For its part, ABC {{was on the verge}} of bankruptcy, with only five owned-and-operated stations and nine full-time affiliates. Its revenues, which were related to advertising and were indexed compared to the number of listeners/viewers, failed to compensate for its heavy investments in purchasing and building stations. In 1951, a rumor <b>even</b> <b>mentioned</b> that the network would be sold to CBS. In 1951, Noble held a 58% ownership stake in ABC, giving him $5 million with which to prevent ABC from going bankrupt; as banks refused further credit, that amount was obtained through a loan from the Prudential Insurance Company of America.|$|E
25|$|Shu Uemura {{sold his}} {{controlling}} {{interest in his}} company to French cosmetics maker L'Oréal in 2004 for an undisclosed amount of money. However, he remained the creative force behind Shu Uemura Cosmetics after the sale. It was estimated that as of early 2008, Shu Uemura Cosmetics made approximately $100 {{million a year in}} global sales at its stores worldwide. At the time of his death, the company had stores in Paris, New York City, London and Hong Kong, as well as outlets throughout Japan. The company's product line has expanded over the years to include hair and lifestyle products, perfume, fake eyelashes and handmade makeup brushes. In the process, the Uemura's company became a cultural force in some circles. Shu Uemura's eyelash curlers were <b>even</b> <b>mentioned</b> in the 2006 film, The Devil Wears Prada.|$|E
