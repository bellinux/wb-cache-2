25|$|In early 2005 Shanghai {{tested a}} new form of {{electric}} bus called capabus that runs without powerlines (catenary free operation) using large onboard supercapacitors that partially recharge whenever the bus is at a stop (under so-called electric umbrellas), and <b>fully</b> <b>charge</b> in the terminus. In 2006, two commercial bus routes began to use the capabuses; one of them is route 11 in Shanghai. It was estimated that the supercapacitor bus was cheaper than a lithium-ion battery bus, and one of its buses had one-tenth the energy cost of a diesel bus with lifetime fuel savings of $200,000.|$|E

They were then charged by thirty turns of the machine, and discharged through the galvanometer, a thick wet string, about ten inches long, being included in the circuit. The needle was immediately deflected five divisions and a half, {{on the one side}} of the zero, and in vibrating passed as nearly as possible through five divisions and a half on the other side.|$|E
50|$|The BTE {{unit has}} a 12-to-15-hour {{operational}} life when <b>fully</b> <b>charged.</b> Each ITM hearing device has a 6-to-8 hour operational life when <b>fully</b> <b>charged.</b> The SoundBite Hearing System includes 1 BTE, 2 ITMs, {{and a system}} charger.|$|R
50|$|When {{recharge}}d, the old cells recharge more rapidly, {{leading to}} a rapid rise of voltage to near the <b>fully</b> <b>charged</b> state, but before the new cells with more capacity have <b>fully</b> recharged. The <b>charge</b> controller detects the high voltage of a nearly <b>fully</b> <b>charged</b> string and reduces current flow. The new cells with more capacity now charge very slowly, so slowly that the chemicals may begin to crystallize before reaching the <b>fully</b> <b>charged</b> state, reducing new cell capacity over several charge/discharge cycles until their capacity more closely matches the old cells in the series string.|$|R
50|$|Trickle {{charging}} means <b>charging</b> a <b>fully</b> <b>charged</b> battery under no-load {{at a rate}} {{equal to}} its self-discharge rate, thus enabling the battery to remain at its <b>fully</b> <b>charged</b> level.

50|$|The cityZENN was {{a planned}} fully certified, highway capable vehicle {{with a top}} speed of 125 km/h and a range of 400 km. Powered by EEStor, the cityZENN would have been {{rechargeable}} in less than 5 minutes, feature operating costs 1/10 of a typical internal combustion engine vehicle and be 100% emission-free at the point of use. The cityZENN was designed to meet the transportation requirements of a large percentage of drivers worldwide. Ian Clifford, CEO of ZENN Motor Company, also stated that a normal household outlet with 110 volt supply would <b>fully</b> <b>charge</b> the EEStor powered CityZENN in 4 hours, and a normal household outlet with 220 volt supply can <b>fully</b> <b>charge</b> the EEStor powered CityZENN in 2 hours.

5000|$|MIT {{introduced}} a new coating that allows the ions to move more easily within the battery. The [...] "Beltway Battery" [...] utilizes a bypass system that allows the lithium ions to enter and leave the electrodes at a speed great enough to <b>fully</b> <b>charge</b> a battery in under a minute. The scientists discovered that by coating lithium iron phosphate particles in a glassy material called lithium pyrophosphate, ions bypass the channels and move faster than in other batteries. Rechargeable batteries store and discharge energy as charged atoms (ions) are moved between two electrodes, the anode and the cathode. Their charge and discharge rate are restricted by {{the speed with which}} these ions move. Such technology could reduce the weight and size of the batteries. A small prototype battery cell has been developed that can <b>fully</b> <b>charge</b> in 10 to 20 seconds, compared with six minutes for standard battery cells.|$|E

50|$|IUoU is a DIN-designation (DIN 41773) for a {{lead-acid}} battery charging procedure {{that is also}} known as 3-stage charging, 3-phase charging, or 3-step charging. It consists of three phases (or stages), to be executed by a battery charger. The three phases are: I-phase (constant electric current), Uo-phase (constant over-voltage), and U-phase (constant voltage). The purpose is to <b>fully</b> <b>charge</b> the battery in a relatively short time without reducing its life span and to indefinitely keep the battery charged as long as the charger is connected.|$|E
50|$|Each {{character}} {{controls in}} exactly the same manner; however, each character has a set of unique attacks along with an ultra-attack that requires the player to expel Power Stocks. By holding the down the attack button, a character can charge up to 3 Power Stocks. The time that it takes to <b>fully</b> <b>charge</b> a stock depends on the current health of the character; a character with more health will take longer to charge while a character with minimal health could charge all 3 stocks in a few seconds.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, {{similar to}} Zod and other Kryptonian Phantom Zone escapees, Non rarely has enough time beneath the yellow sun of Earth to absorb and metabolize enough yellow {{sunlight}} {{to experience the}} full measure of his abilities as {{he and the other}} escapees are typically always defeated and banished back to the Zone before any significant length of time passes. As such, if Non were allowed enough time in the Sun to <b>fully</b> <b>charge</b> his cells with yellow solar energy; Non would be significantly more physically powerful and more potent with superhuman strength than any other adult Kryptonian, possibly even Superman.|$|E

50|$|Vados are {{powered by}} Lithium-Ion batteries, charged via USB power. The USB {{connector}} {{can be found}} at the bottom of the unit, and is held in place magnetically. When a USB connection is required, the flexible male A-type USB connector is simply pulled out of its place and connected to a computer's USB port. Vado devices offer two USB modes - A normal mode, which charges whilst allowing data transfer over USB, and an express mode, which enables a fast charge (4 hours to <b>fully</b> <b>charge,</b> as opposed to 7.5 hours in the normal mode), but disallows any form of data transfer.|$|E
50|$|Chargers for car {{batteries}} come {{in varying}} ratings. Chargers that are rated {{up to two}} amperes {{may be used to}} maintain charge on parked vehicle batteries or for small batteries on garden tractors or similar equipment. A motorist may keep a charger rated a few amperes to ten or fifteen amperes for maintenance of automobile batteries or to recharge a vehicle battery that has accidentally discharged. Service stations and commercial garages will have a large charger to <b>fully</b> <b>charge</b> a battery in an hour or two; often these chargers can briefly source the hundreds of amperes required to crank an internal combustion engine starter.|$|E
