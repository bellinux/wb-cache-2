40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} sort Jonagold apples using a four bands multi-spectral image acquisition device. Multi-spectral images of sound tissue and various defects were acquired. Defects could be divided into four classes: <b>slight</b> <b>defects</b> (e. g. small russet), more serious defects (scar tissue), defects leading to {{the rejection of the}} fruit (e. g. rot) and recent bruises (between one hour and two hours old). Image segmentation was based on the Bayes' theorem. Each pixel of the fruit was classified into 'healthy' or 'defect' classes according to the probability distribution of the spectral components of each class. Once segmented, the fruit was graded by linear discriminant analysis {{on the basis of the}} relative area of the defect and statistical parameters computed on the spectral components of the two tissues classes. Results (cross validation) showed 94 % and 84 % if the sound and defective fruits respectively well classified. Most of the misclassified defective fruits (89 %) belonged to the <b>slight</b> <b>defect</b> category. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Purpose : to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of agent Hylomax-Сomod in the postoperative period of Laser Epithelial Keratomileusis (LASEK). Methods : In 60 eyes (30 patients) was performed excimer laser vision correction by LASEK. According to study patients were randomized into 2 groups. Patients of the Group I have been treated by the standard protocol of medical support. Patients of the Group II along with the standard regimen were recieved Hylomax-Сomod. Results : On the 2 nd day after the excimer laser correction for 63. 3 % had patients of Group I had complete epithelialization of the ablation zone, the rest — a <b>slight</b> <b>defect</b> in the optical zone that recovered for 3 - 4 days. In Group II 80 % of patients was determined by complete epithelialization of the ablation zone, the remaining 20 % of patients went to a <b>slight</b> <b>defect</b> in the third day, which is 17 % {{lower than that of}} patients in group I. Conclusion : Hylomax-Сomod promotes rapid healing of the ablation zone, reduce the risk of complications. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{method to}} sort 'Jonagold' apples {{based on the}} {{presence}} of defects was proposed. A multi-spectral vision system including four wavelength bands in the visible/NIR range was developed. Multi-spectral images of sound and defective fruits were acquired tending to cover the whole colour variability of this bicolour apple variety. Defects were grouped into four categories: <b>slight</b> <b>defects,</b> more serious defects, defects leading to the rejection of the fruit and recent bruises. Stem-ends/calyxes were detected using a correlation pattern matching algorithm. The efficiency of this method depended on the orientation of the stem-end/calyx according to the optical axis of the camera. Defect segmentation consisted in a pixel classification procedure based on the Bayes' theorem and non-parametric models of the sound and defective tissue. Fruit classification tests were performed in order to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. No error was made on rejected fruits and high classification rates were reached for apples presenting serious defects and recent bruises. Fruits with <b>slight</b> <b>defects</b> presented a more important misclassification rate but those errors fitted however the quality tolerances of the European standard. Considering an actual ratio of sound fruits of 90 %, less than 2 % of defective fruits were classified into the sound ones. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|R

This disorder is extremely distressing and causes poor functioning as well as decreased quality of life. Methodology: A systematic {{review of the literature}} was conducted to determine whether differences in patient outcomes existed when using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) versus selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the treatment of BDD. Results: After a review of the literature, it was found that aggressive treatment using both CBT and SSRIs together proved to be more successful in preventing reoccurrence of BDD symptoms than using either treatment alone. Conclusion: Sufficient evidence stands that using CBT and SSRI treatments separately are effective in the treatment of BDD, but using both treatments together proves to be more efficacious and produce better patient outcomes...|$|R
