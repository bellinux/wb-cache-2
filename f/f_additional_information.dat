A two-argument {{function}} is computed privately by two parties if after the computation, no party should {{know anything about}} the other inputs except for what he is able to deduce from his own input and the function value. In [1] Bar-Yehuda, Chor, Kushilevitz, and Orlitsky give a complete characterisation of two-argument functions which can be computed privately (in the information-theoretical sense) in the Honest-But-Curious model and study protocols for “non-private ” functions revealing as little information about the inputs as possible. The authors define a measure which determines for any function <b>f</b> the <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> E(f) required for computing f and claim that f is privately-computable if and only if E(f) = 0. In our paper we show that the characterisation is false: we give a privately-computable function f with E(f) = 0 and another function g with E(g) = 0 thatisnot privately-computable. Moreover, we show some rather unexpected and strange properties of the measure for <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> given by Bar-Yehuda et al. and we introduce an alternative measure. We show that for this new measure the minimal leakage of information of randomized and deterministic protocols are equal. Finally, we present some general relations between the information gain of an optimal protocol and the communication complexity of a function. ...|$|R

A tooltip (<b>f)</b> provides <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> on demand for each segment. Both general and context-based operations are available by invoking (g) a context menu. The need for pattern discovery in long time-series data led researchers to develop interactive visualization tools and analytical algorithms for gaining {{insight into the}} data. Most {{of the literature on}} time-series data visualization either focus on a small number of tasks or a specific domain. We propose KronoMiner, a tool that embeds new interaction and visualization techniques as well as analytical capabilities for the visual exploration of time-series data. The interface’s design has been iteratively refined based on feedback from expert users. Qualitative evaluation with an expert user not involved in the design process indicates that our prototype is promising for further research...|$|R

30|$|To {{reduce the}} high PAPR in OFDM, {{a number of}} {{approaches}} have been proposed. The existing solutions are broadly classified into two categories: receiver-dependent schemes and receiver-independent schemes. Receiver-dependent schemes transmit a PAPR reduction signal including <b>additional</b> <b>information.</b> At the receiver side, the transmitted signal can be decoded using the <b>additional</b> <b>information.</b> Typically, the tone reservation (TR) [3], selective mapping (SLM) [4], and partial transmit sequence (PTS) [5] are receiver-dependent schemes. However, the inclusion of <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> in receiver-dependent schemes will cause {{a reduction in the}} data rate. Furthermore, to enable the use of <b>additional</b> <b>information,</b> the receiver structure should be modified to restore the PAPR reduction signals.|$|R
