500|$|The Writers Guild of America went {{on strike}} on November4, 2007, by which time only eight of the planned sixteen episodes of Lost fourth season had been written. [...] These episodes aired from January to March 2008. [...] After the strike ended on February12, 2008, the writers {{found that there was}} only enough time to produce five episodes, {{although}} the fifth episode would later be expanded to two episodes—and they proceeded to compress most of the storylines of the planned eight episodes into six, with some carrying over into the fifth season. [...] Executive producer/head writer Damon Lindelof stated that [...] "we are going to execute our full story plan for season four. [...] This simply requires a shift from high-octane storytelling to superhigh-octane storytelling. [...] It requires no cramming, only a slightly heavier foot on the gas pedal... so, <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> hats. [...] Those of you waiting for the long-anticipated [...] and Hurley Ping-Pong tournament, however, will be very disappointed." [...] The writers expressed interest to air the eighth episode with the second batch of episodes, but ABC did not comply and [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] served as the mid-season premiere. [...] The writers realized some advantages to the strike: they were able to use actors whose shows had been canceled during the strike, {{and they were able to}} respond to confusion from the audience. [...] They would later even conclude that the season was better as a result of the interruption, as they were able to discard [...] "languid, contemplative material" [...] and felt [...] "recharged [...] a real energy to attack [...] last six episodes". [...] The first three seasons were broadcast on Wednesdays in the United States and Canada; the pre-strike fourth-season episodes aired on Thursdays at 9:00p.m., a time slot normally occupied by Grey's Anatomy. [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] and the following three episodes were broadcast on Thursdays at 10:00p.m., after Grey's Anatomy.|$|E

He wrote the latter as an account of waking up in a hotel room with an idea for a song but being unable to find a paper or instrument to compose. The narrative found him fighting with staff to use the hotel's lounge piano, while losing the song's melody and lyrics from his memory in the distraction. On the title track, Scott-Heron voiced feelings of alienation and disillusionment with the future while reflecting on the past.|$|E

[...] "The melodies are only functional", he wrote, [...] "but the rhythms are seductive and the singing is warm." [...] Christgau ranked {{it as the}} 32nd best record of 1980 in his year-end list for the Pazz & Jop critics poll. Geoff Brown from Black Music & Jazz Review gave the album {{four out of five}} stars and said Scott-Heron's songs were one of the few remedies for alleviating the [...] "creeping suspicion which must afflict us all from time to time, that black artists can only write convincingly these days about the topics of love and dancing." [...] AllMusic's Jeff Schwachter also gave it four stars in a retrospective review, finding it abundant with [...] "perceptive and poignant observations on the state of America as it advanced into a new and uncertain decade". In Schwachter's opinion, the music retained past styles amidst exceptional arrangements of synthesizers, horns, and background vocals, all of which gave the record [...] "a quality that matched the aura of the period", especially on [...] "Alien (<b>Hold</b> <b>On</b> <b>to</b> <b>Your</b> Dreams)".|$|E

The song was written and composed by Jude Gitamondoc, and produced by Ito Rapadas under Universal Records.

[...] The song is an inspirational power ballad, and it shows off the singers power vocals and belting range during {{the latter part of}} the song.

Bono said, [...] "With this record we were looking for the raw, naked and personal, to strip everything back."

5000|$|... "Believe in the Dream" [...] is an {{inspirational}} ballad song, that contains elements of {{rhythm and blues}} and soul. The song's structure is {{comparable to that of}} power ballads.

Lyrically, the song talks about <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> dreams, and not letting anyone get in <b>your</b> way <b>to</b> achieving it. It also interprets faith in yourself and belief in God. The song was a critical acclaim, being called a [...] "standout" [...] by music critics. FORG of PhilCharts.com stated [...] "The standout ballad in the album is the inspirational song “Believe in the Dream” where Nina not only shows her impressive vocal range but she also heightens the song’s emotion through the rawness that exudes from her vocals.

40|$|What is the {{rational}} response to disagreement with an epistemic peer? Some say the steadfast response of <b>holding</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> own belief can be rational; {{others argue that}} some degree of conciliation is always rationally required. I argue that only an epistemological externalist about rationality-someone who holds that {{the rational}}ity of a belief is partly constituted by factors outside a subject's cognitive perspective-can defend the steadfast view. Or at least that this is so {{in the kinds of}} idealized cases of peer disagreement that take center stage in the current debate about disagreement. The argument has three steps. First, I show how rationality internalism motivates conciliationism: in view of the mutually recognized internal epistemic symmetry between peers, it would be arbitrary for either peer <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> her own belief. Second, I strengthen this line of thought by considering various proposed 'symmetry breakers' that appear to introduce a relevant asymmetry between peers, which could be used to defend the rationality of a steadfast response. I argue that none of these alleged symmetry breakers can help internalists. Third, I show how externalism does have the resources to defend steadfastness and expose how extant defenses of steadfastness implicitly rely on externalist intuitions. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|R

During that time, the quest for the fountain of youth shifted from the stuff of legend to a driving motivation behind modern science. In the four chapters of this dissertation, I bring literary critical methods <b>to</b> bear <b>on</b> literary and scientific texts, public health tracts, journalistic accounts, advertisements and public records. Through this survey of science, government and popular culture, I document the formation of several cultural narratives of aging [...] or, formulaic ways of addressing aging produced by repeated metaphors, imagery and story lines [...] that circulated with reciprocal influence through all of these spheres, determining attitudes toward, and experiences of, aging at that moment and into the present. After briefly exploring our contemporary "anti-aging" culture, the four chapters of The Age of Obsolescence address the framing of a moral responsibility for aging individuals to "take care of themselves" as a duty to their nation; the association of aging with obsolescence and its influence on worker's experiences and industrial practices; the scientific and cultural construction of aging as a disease in need of professional intervention; and the proposed "cure" for this problem of aging: scientific rejuvenation, particularly the glandular rejuvenation fad of the 1920 s. My conclusion traces this fervor for scientific rejuvenation into the present, showing how the turn-of-the-century cultural logic of aging has become a taken-for-granted framework of American popular culture today. In illuminating the historical moment when the "problem" of aging was located in the bodies of aged individuals, I point toward solutions that may arise not from scientific discovery, but from rewriting these cultural narratives of aging and old age and restructuring the national practices that stem from them.

And I kinda went to bed that morning thinking about how this thing that I had always loved was gone now. It’s like John Lennon dying, there’s not going to be anymore Beatles reunions, for sure. There’s not going to be any Band reunions. And I was thinking this girl will probably be gone sometime soon too, you know, things just come and go in life.
