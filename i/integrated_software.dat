2500|$|A backronym (or bacronym) is {{a phrase}} that is {{constructed}} [...] "after the fact" [...] from a previously existing word. For example, the novelist and critic Anthony Burgess once proposed that the word [...] "book" [...] ought to stand for [...] "Box Of Organized Knowledge." [...] A classic real-world {{example of this is}} the name of the predecessor to the Apple Macintosh, The Apple Lisa, which was said to refer to [...] "Local <b>Integrated</b> <b>Software</b> Architecture", but was actually named after Steve Jobs' daughter, born in 1978.|$|E
2500|$|Virtual {{simulations}} {{represent a}} specific category of simulation that utilizes simulation equipment {{to create a}} simulated world for the user. Virtual simulations allow users to interact with a virtual world. Virtual worlds operate on platforms of <b>integrated</b> <b>software</b> and hardware components. In this manner, the system can accept input from the user (e.g., body tracking, voice/sound recognition, physical controllers) and produce output to the user (e.g., visual display, aural display, haptic display) [...] Virtual Simulations use the aforementioned modes of interaction to produce a sense of immersion for the user.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the ArcGIS suite, Esri {{had focused}} its {{software}} {{development on the}} command line Arc/INFO workstation program and several Graphical User Interface-based products such as the ArcView GIS 3.x desktop program. [...] Other Esri products included MapObjects, a programming library for developers, and ArcSDE as a relational database management system. [...] The various products had branched out into multiple source trees and did not integrate well with one another. [...] In January 1997, Esri decided to revamp its GIS software platform, creating a single <b>integrated</b> <b>software</b> architecture.|$|E
2500|$|Mechatronics is a {{combination}} of mechanics and electronics. [...] It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. [...] In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. <b>Integrated</b> <b>software</b> controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.|$|E
2500|$|Jobs {{went there}} for the birth after he was {{contacted}} by Robert Friedland, their mutual friend and the farm owner. While distant, Jobs worked with her on {{a name for the}} baby, which they discussed while sitting in the fields on a blanket. Brennan suggested the name [...] "Lisa" [...] which Jobs also liked and notes that Jobs was very attached to the name [...] "Lisa" [...] while he [...] "was also publicly denying paternity." [...] She would discover later that during this time, Jobs was preparing to unveil a new kind of computer that he wanted to give a female name (his first choice was [...] "Claire" [...] after St. Clare). She also stated that she never gave him permission to use the baby's name for a computer and he hid the plans from her. Jobs also worked with his team {{to come up with the}} phrase, [...] "Local <b>Integrated</b> <b>Software</b> Architecture" [...] as an alternative explanation for the Apple Lisa (decades later, however, Jobs admitted to his biographer Walter Isaacson that [...] "obviously, it was named for my daughter"). Brennan would come under intense criticism from Jobs, who claimed that [...] "she doesn't want money, she just wants me." [...] According to Brennan, Apple's Mike Scott wanted Jobs to give her money, while other Apple executives [...] "advised him to ignore me or fight if I tried to go after a paternity settlement." ...|$|E

The realities of software development and market considerations made <b>integrated</b> <b>software</b> still attractive to some users. Claris moved its integrated program to Windows and called it ClarisWorks for Windows. Developers of standalone products introduced integrated versions with additional abilities like Wordperfect Works, which was based on an earlier competitor to AppleWorks made by Beagle Bros.
