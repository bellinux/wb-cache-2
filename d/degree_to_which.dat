5|$|The {{reductions}} were self-sufficient {{indigenous communities}} of 2,000–4,000 inhabitants, usually headed by two Jesuit priests and the cabildo (town council and cacique (tribal leader), who retained their functions {{and played the}} role of intermediaries between the native peoples and the Jesuits. However, the <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> the Jesuits controlled the indigenous population for which they had responsibility and the <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> they allowed indigenous culture to function is a matter of debate, and the social organization of the reductions have been variously described as jungle utopias on the one hand, to theocratic regimes of terror, the former description being much closer to the mark.|$|E

5|$|Centred {{primarily}} in Western countries, {{those involved in}} the New Age have been primarily from middle and upper-middle-class backgrounds. The <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> New Agers are involved in the milieu varied considerably, from those who adopted a number of New Age ideas and practices to those who fully embraced and dedicated their lives to it. The New Age has generated criticism from established Christian organisations as well as modern Pagan and indigenous communities. From the 1990s onward, the New Age became the subject of research by academic scholars of religious studies.|$|E

In what follows, the (e 2, Δe 2)-FIS system with the (4, 4)-partitioned regions to the fuzzy I/O domains [8] is employed, due to its excellent performance and moderate complexity. The output of the fuzzification process demonstrates a fuzzy degree of membership between 0 and 1.|$|R

5|$|In {{psychological}} assessments, the name-letter {{effect has}} been exploited to measure self-esteem. There {{are two types of}} self-esteem: explicit self-esteem (a person's deliberate and conscious evaluation of themselves) and implicit self-esteem.

[...] Accordingly, the racial paradigms employed in different disciplines vary in their emphasis on biological reduction as contrasted with societal construction.|$|R
50|$|Notable {{scholars}} {{that have}} conducted {{this type of}} inquiry include media theorists such as Marshall McLuhan, Walter Ong, Gregory Ulmer, and Cynthia Selfe. Much of McLuhan's work, for example, centered around the impact of written language on oral cultures, <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> various media are accessible and interactive, {{and the ways in}} which electronic media determine communication patterns. His evaluation of technology as a shaper of human societies and psyches indicates a strong connection between historical forces and literacy practices.|$|R
40|$|To {{find the}} {{relation}} between two concepts, social scientists traditionally look for correlations between the numerical quantities describing these concepts.

Tasks with such background justify the necessity of aggregation of binary fuzzy relations and we contribute to the topic in this paper.
