Furthermore, in the context of internal studies, where smaller internally induced Sq signals are to be delineated, the contribution of tidal magnetic signals becomes a significant deteriorating factor.|$|R

2500|$|The giant {{impact theory}} hypothesizes that the Moon {{resulted}} from {{the impact of a}} Mars-sized body, Theia, with the very young Earth. This giant impact also gave the Earth its axial tilt and velocity of rotation. Rapid rotation reduces the <b>daily</b> <b>variation</b> in temperature and makes photosynthesis viable. The Rare Earth hypothesis further argues that the axial tilt cannot be too large or too small (relative to the orbital plane). A planet with a large tilt (inclination) will experience extreme seasonal variations in climate, unfriendly to complex life. A planet with little or no tilt will lack the stimulus to evolution that climate variation provides. In this view, the Earth's tilt is [...] "just right". The gravity of a large satellite also stabilizes the planet's tilt; without this effect the variation in tilt would be chaotic, probably making complex life forms on land impossible.|$|E

30|$|The {{resonant}} {{period of}} geomagnetic field lines {{depends on the}} length of the field line, the magnetic field strength along the field line, and the plasma density along the field line (Hughes 1994; Waters et al. 2006; Menk 2011). Field-line length increases with geomagnetic latitude, so the fundamental FLR period generally increases geomagnetically poleward. Because magnetic field strength and plasma density are highly dynamic, the FLR period fluctuates in time; for example, <b>daily</b> <b>variations</b> in plasma density cause <b>daily</b> <b>variations</b> in FLR period (Poulter et al. 1988).|$|R
6000|$|The {{next day}} brought {{us into the}} midst of the Atlantic solitudes--out of smoke-colored {{sounding}} into fathomless deep blue; no ships visible anywhere over the wide ocean; no company but Mother Carey's chickens wheeling, darting, skimming the waves in the sun. There were some seafaring men among the passengers, and conversation drifted into matter concerning ships and sailors. One said that [...] "true as the needle to the pole" [...] was a bad figure, since the needle seldom pointed to the pole. He said a ship's compass was not faithful to any particular point, but was the most fickle and treacherous of the servants of man. It was forever changing. It changed every day in the year; consequently the amount of the <b>daily</b> <b>variation</b> had to be ciphered out and allowance made for it, else the mariner would go utterly astray. Another said there was a vast fortune waiting for the genius who should invent a compass that would not be affected by the local influences of an iron ship. He said there was only one creature more fickle than a wooden ship's compass, and that was the compass of an iron ship. Then came reference to the well known fact that an experienced mariner can look at the compass of a new iron vessel, thousands of mile from her birthplace, and tell which way her head was pointing when she was in process of building.|$|E

In this study, we wanted to expand our knowledge on these relationships by investigating the daily fluctuations in these variables. Youngsters completed a 7 -day diary to assess daily parental rejection, peer rejection and emotional eating. Using multilevel analyses, our results showed that <b>daily</b> <b>variations</b> in parental rejection were related to <b>daily</b> <b>variations</b> in emotional eating of the youngsters. This highlights the importance of addressing the parent-child relationship in interventions for emotional eating in youngsters. Background: This study investigated the daily relation between parental rejection and peer rejection {{on the one hand and}} emotional eating in youngsters on the other hand. Methods: Participants (N = 55) between the ages of 11 and 15 years completed a 7 -day diary. A multilevel design was used to examine day-to-day within-person relationships between parental and peer rejection (measured by CHS) and emotional eating (measured by DEBQ-C) of youngsters. Results: The results showed that <b>daily</b> <b>variations</b> in parental rejection were related to <b>daily</b> <b>variations</b> in emotional eating of the youngsters. Daily peer rejection was only marginally significantly related to the emotional eating of the youngsters. Conclusions: These results indicate that especially parental rejection, and to a lesser extent peer rejection, are associated with the emotional eating of youngsters.

There would be several advantages in the operation such as: Less use of expensive peak load power where often expensive fuels are used. Less need for peak load power capacity.

As expected, sea floor horizontal tidal magnetic fields differ substantially from those at the surface both in amplitude and in spatial structure.

Even though Sq signals are a few {{times larger than the}} tidal signals for most regions, owing to their substantially different global patterns, tidal signals may exceed Sq signals at many locations. This, in particular, is plausible for the vertical magnetic field component Z of the <b>daily</b> <b>variations.</b>|$|R
