The KZFT filter in the KZA package of R-software has a parameter f = frequency. By defining this parameter {{for each of the}} known dominant frequencies found in the spectrum, KZFT filter with parameters m=300 and k=3 to reconstruct the signal about each frequency (0.08 and 0.10 cycles per unit time). The reconstructed signal was determined by applying the KZFT filter twice (once about each dominant frequency) and then the summing the results of each filter.

Since the periodicity {{exists in the}} resampled region of the image, {{it can be found}} in the result of the variance of n-th order differentiation of the image signal. Also, the resampling factor can be estimated based on the periodicity of the signals. Here, we introduce a resampling detection method [4] based on that facts. As we mentioned in Section 3.1, the resampling process is composed of main two functions: image sampling and image reconstruction. Also the image reconstruction is performed with an interpolation kernel. Therefore, we can conclude that the resampling process causes the <b>hidden</b> <b>periodicity</b> only if we prove the periodicity came from the interpolation process.|$|E

The {{idea behind}} this {{theory is that}} {{man-made}} signals possess <b>hidden</b> <b>periodicities</b> such as the carrier frequency, the symbol rate or the chip rate, that can be regenerated by a sine-wave extraction operation which produces features at frequencies that depend on these <b>hidden</b> <b>periodicities</b> (hence called cyclic features and cycle frequencies resp.). Since the SOCS is based on quadratic nonlinearities, two frequency parameters are used for the sine-wave extraction function. The result is called the spectral correlation density (SCD), and can be represented in a bifrequency plane. The SCD {{can be seen as}} a generalization of the PSD, as it is equal to the PSD when the cycle frequency is equal to zero. Therefore, the SOCS cyclic feature detectors act like energy detectors, but at cycle frequencies different from zero. The advantage of these detectors comes from the absence of features (at least asymptotically) when the input signal is stationary (such as white noise), since no hidden frequencies are present, or when the input signal exhibits cyclostationarity at cycle frequencies different than the one of interest. The HOCS cyclic-feature detectors are based on the same principles, but the equivalent of the SCD is a [...]...|$|R

Here we advance the method to bring out very weak second-order peaks, which we demonstrate for what we believe is the first time. The unmistakable presence of both the first- and second-order peaks, which have identical shapes as the zeroth-order peak, is strong evidence of the <b>hidden</b> <b>periodicity</b> and serves as a novel method for the detection of weak periodicities hidden behind strong randomness...|$|E

A 35 -min time sequence {{obtained in the}} Cathinspii H line over a quiet region {{at the center of}} the solar disk under high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution has been used. A relatively new approach is used to detect the <b>hidden</b> <b>periodicity</b> and to extract the associated periodic component(s) from an apparently irregular time series. The unique feature of this approach is that the constituent component(s) can be non-sinusoidal in nature. The periodicity analysis shows that time series of intensity oscillations of most of the bright points can be composed of two non-sinusoidal periodic components with periodicity varying between 2. 4 min and 5. 8 min. With the help of a multivariate embedding technique, globally significant spatial nonlinear correlation is found. The identification of the nonlinear interaction between bright points is performed by using the methods of dynamical phase synchronization and the similarity index. The analysis indicates that bright points are interconnected in the sense that some bright points are more active and can influence the other relatively passive bright points...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDue to Shor's algorithm, quantum {{computers}} are a severe threat for public key cryptography. This motivated the cryptographic community {{to search for}} quantum-safe solutions. On the other hand, the impact of quantum computing on secret key cryptography is much less understood. In this paper, we consider attacks where an adversary can query an oracle implementing a cryptographic primitive in a quantum superposition of different states. This model gives {{a lot of power}} to the adversary, but recent results show that it is nonetheless possible to build secure cryptosystems in it. We study applications of a quantum procedure called Simon's algorithm (the simplest quantum period finding algorithm) in order to attack symmetric cryptosystems in this model. Following previous works in this direction, we show that several classical attacks based on finding collisions can be dramatically sped up using Simon's algorithm: finding a collision requires Ω(2 n/ 2) queries in the classical setting, but when collisions happen with some <b>hidden</b> <b>periodicity,</b> they can be found with only O(n) queries in the quantum model. We obtain attacks with very strong implications. First, we show that the most widely used modes of operation for authentication and authenticated encryption (e. g. CBC-MAC, PMAC, GMAC, GCM, and OCB) are completely broken in this security model. Our attacks are also applicable to many CAESAR candidates: CLOC, AEZ, COPA, OTR, POET, OMD, and Minalpher. This is quite surprising compared to the situation with encryption modes: Anand et al. show that standard modes are secure with a quantum-secure PRF. Second, we show that Simon's algorithm can also be applied to slide attacks, leading to an exponential speed-up of a classical symmetric cryptanalysis technique in the quantum model...|$|E
