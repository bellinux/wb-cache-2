All senators <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> before a vote could be held, and since all meetings had to end by nightfall, a senator could talk a proposal to death (a filibuster or diem consumere) if they could keep the debate going until nightfall. It is known, for example, that the senator Cato the Younger once filibustered {{in an attempt to}} prevent the Senate from granting Julius Caesar a law that would have given land to the veterans of Pompey.|$|E
5|$|Series creator Rob Thomas {{thought that}} the {{character}} would be a perfect role for Rudd, stating that he would perform it in a British accent and had high expectations for the comedy of the episode because it was being written by Enbom. However, Thomas did not release any details about Rudd's plot line in the episode before its airing. Rudd compared his character to Andrew Ridgeley and Peter O'Toole. In the scene in which Veronica meets Desmond, the film of camera angles while Kristen Bell was speaking were inadvertently destroyed, leading to these camera angles being filmed nearly six weeks later. Bell <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> her lines without Rudd present.|$|E

25|$|The {{social milieu}} {{was that of}} a few Austronesian men who settled on the {{outskirts}} of an East Trans-Fly group, intermarried, and whose children were either bilingual, or speakers of their mothers' language, with some knowledge of their fathers' language. The local people did not need to speak the traders' language, who in turn <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> the local language. The children in turn would then speak the local language, with varying ability in the fathers' language, particularly in areas that were culturally important for the fathers.|$|E
25|$|The Qissa-i Sanjan {{is a tale}} of {{the journey}} of the Parsis to India from Iran.

However, the Parsi community had to abide by three rules: they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> the local language, follow local marriage customs, and not carry any weapons. After showing the many similarities between their faith and local beliefs, the early community was granted a plot of land on which to build a fire temple.|$|E
25|$|Kon Ichikawa {{stated in}} a Criterion Collection {{interview}} that he had witnessed {{the destruction of the}} atom bomb first hand, and had felt since then that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> out against the horrors of war, despite the many comedies that made up most of his early career. Fires on the Plain got greenlighted by the studio Daiei, because they thought it would be an action movie. Ichikawa decided that it was a film that needed to be made in black and white, specifically requesting Eastman's black and white. The studio initially balked, but after a month of arguing, the studio agreed to Ichikawa's request. Ichikawa also said that he had wanted actor Eiji Funakoshi to be in the film from the beginning. Ichikawa's wife, Natto Wada, penned the script which got the approval of novel author Shohei Ooka.|$|E

500|$|Several {{actors were}} {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Robert Modell, even Lance Henriksen, who went on to play the lead role in Millennium. Initially, Gilligan considered Harvey Fierstein for the role of Modell, but Robert Wisden read the script and [...] "blew us away". Rob Bowman was pleased with Wisden's performance and said, [...] "I thought Robert Wisden was great as Pusher. He is a very energized kind of confident actor with lots of ideas of his own. It took me about {{a day and a half}} to get him into it, and then I never <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to him again, because he had that look in his eyes. I would walk up to talk to him about the scene and I could see that he was already there.|$|E
500|$|From 2009, {{several former}} church {{executives}} {{began to speak}} out about the Hole, both {{to the media and}} to the FBI. Rathbun wrote in the New York Daily News in July 2012 that he had [...] "decided that [...] <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> out before someone was killed in the Hole". In June 2009, the Tampa Bay Times published a series of articles on the internal workings of the Church of Scientology titled [...] "The Truth Rundown", detailing accounts of beatings and other episodes of violence between Miscavige and other top Scientology executives. The Times followed up in January 2013 with a detailed account of the Hole, supplemented by interviews with defectors from Scientology, while The Village Voice sought to compile a list of the executives said to have been incarcerated there. ABC News also reported on Debbie Cook's account of the Hole.|$|E
500|$|Davis {{was happy}} to have an episode of his own, but was puzzled {{at some of the}} contradictions in the script, such as having him assassinate John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., but being {{concerned}} with something as minor as keeping the Buffalo Bills from winning the Super Bowl. Chris Carter said [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> with Bill several times; I spent hours with him on the telephone talking about the character, because the actor felt that the episode really made the character something that it wasn't. I tried to explain to him, as I think Jim and Glen were trying to express, that even if your mission in life is a destroyer, that you still have some hope {{in the back of your}} mind that you can be a creator— and that this all of a sudden, this vanity, is his vanity. And we see that so clearly here and it makes him sort of a silly person".|$|E

500|$|Carey Mulligan {{was cast}} as Winnie Gekko, Gordon's estranged {{daughter}} and Jacob's fiancée. Winnie has not {{spoken to her}} father since his imprisonment; she blames Gordon for the suicide of her drugged-out brother, Rudy. The character has been {{said to be the}} [...] "moral center of the story" [...] and described as being liberal, and to some extent passive. Mulligan is British and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> with an American accent for her role. Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps was her first major studio film. When she first met Stone for the role she explained that she did not want her character to be a [...] "token girlfriend;" [...] both agreed to work to make sure that would not happen. During the same encounter Stone learned that she had short hair, and he initially discussed having her wear a wig, but Mulligan said she did not feel like herself when wearing the hairpiece. Stone trusted her and made an exception. According to Mulligan, Stone cast her in the Wall Street sequel based on her performance in An Education (2009).|$|E
500|$|One of Oscorp's leading {{scientific}} minds who {{attempts to}} engineer a revolutionary regeneration serum to help regrow limbs and human tissue. Something goes wrong, {{and he is}} transformed into the monster known as the Lizard. Ifans said his character spends {{the majority of the}} film as a human. While playing the 9-foot-tall reptile, Ifans was required to wear a CGI suit. Initially, a large stunt-double was used as a stand-in for the role, but Ifans insisted on portraying the transformed character. Commenting on the technology used to bring his character to life, Ifans continued, [...] "I had a green suit on, and then this cardboard head, and these small claws... Each and every time you see the Lizard, the technology is so advanced now that when the Lizard's eyes move, they're my eyes. If I frown or show any emotion, they're my emotions. That's how spectacularly advanced technology is." [...] Ifans said that he voiced the man-beast as well, explaining, [...] "I'm sure the voice will be toyed with in the eventual edits, but when I was shooting the CGI moments, when I wasn't actually human, when I was Lizard, I looked like a crash-test dummy in a green leotard thing. There were many moments when I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone as the Lizard." ...|$|E
500|$|Sullivan Stapleton plays Damien Scott, {{a former}} United States Delta Force {{operator}} who {{is familiar with}} the antagonists of the second series, and an acquaintance of John Porter. He is recruited by Section 20 to help Sergeant Michael Stonebridge find and rescue the kidnapped Porter. Stapleton describes Scott as cocky, rebellious and arrogant, and that it was good to have somebody like him in Section 20 because [...] "he is the one that usually goes in first and takes the bullets, whereas Stonebridge arrives at the last minute and saves the day." [...] The actor opined that Scott is chosen for the dangerous role because he is daring and does not have any immediate family members who rely on him. Of Scott and Stonebridge's working relationship, Stapleton said [...] "they have a professional respect for each other" [...] but start to annoy each other. When the actor first read the script for Project Dawn, he saw himself for the role as Scott. Because Stapleton is an Australian actor, he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> with an American accent throughout the series. He was wary whether he did it right because he barely worked with Americans on the show, but believed he did okay when HBO, the network that operated Cinemax, was satisfied with it. Stapleton has signed up for another Strike Back series should it be commissioned.|$|E

500|$|Jinnah devoted much of {{his time}} to his law {{practice}} in the early 1900s, but remained politically involved. [...] Jinnah began political life by attending the Congress's twentieth annual meeting, in Bombay in December 1904. He {{was a member of the}} moderate group in the Congress, favouring Hindu–Muslim unity in achieving self-government, and following such leaders as Mehta, Naoroji, and Gopal Krishna Gokhale. They were opposed by leaders such as Tilak and Lala Lajpat Rai, who sought quick action towards independence. [...] In 1906, a delegation of Muslim leaders headed by the Aga Khan called on the new Viceroy of India, Lord Minto, to assure him of their loyalty and to ask for assurances that in any political reforms they would be protected from the [...] "unsympathetic [...] majority". [...] Dissatisfied with this, Jinnah wrote a letter to the editor of the newspaper Gujarati, asking what right the members of the delegation <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> for Indian Muslims, as they were unelected and self-appointed. [...] When many of the same leaders met in Dacca in December of that year to form the All-India Muslim League to advocate for their community's interests, Jinnah was again opposed. The Aga Khan later wrote that it was [...] "freakishly ironic" [...] that Jinnah, who would lead the League to independence, [...] "came out in bitter hostility toward all that I and my friends had done... He said that our principle of separate electorates was dividing the nation against itself." [...] In its earliest years, however, the League was not influential; Minto refused to consider it as the Muslim community's representative, and it was ineffective in preventing the 1911 repeal of the partition of Bengal, an action seen as a blow to Muslim interests.|$|E
