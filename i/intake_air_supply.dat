A random arrangement of montmorillonite particles is then difficult or impossible to obtain by ordinary techniques. Jonas & Kuykendall (1966) have reported that randomly oriented particles {{can be obtained by}} spray-drying a dilute suspension of montmorillonite in water and collecting the finely divided clay in an electrostatic precipitator. We present here another method of obtaining randomly oriented montmorillonite particles that involves the formation of an aerogel upon freeze-drying the clay suspension. The randomly oriented particles used to produce the powder diffraction patterns in Fig. 1 were prepared by freeze-drying on a Virtis Freeze Dry apparatus. The procedure used was to spray the size-fractionated but otherwise untreated clay-water suspensions into ultra-cold pentane in a stainless teel beaker (Sctmettler, Monfforte & Rhodes, 1967). The pentane was constantly stirred during the process. The beaker and pentane were cooled by submersion i a dry-ice acetone bath. The suspensions were sprayed through a drawn glass nozzle attached to a beaker of clay suspension by tygon tubing.

The combustion and emission characteristics are investigated with variation of <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> temperature, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate and <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> pressure. The results show that <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> temperature has great influence on HCCI combustion characteristic. Increased <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> temperature results in advance combustion phase, shorten combustion duration, and lower indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP). Increased EGR rate retards combustion start phase and prolongs combustion duration, while maximum pressure rising rate and NOx emission are reduced with increase of EGR rate. In the condition with constant fuel flow quantity, increased air pressure leads to retarded combustion phase and lower pressure rising rate, which will reduce the engine knocking tendency. In the condition with constant air fuel ratio condition, fuel injection quantity increases as <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> pressure increases, which lead to high heat release rate and high emission level. The optimal <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> temperature varies in different operating area, which can be tuned from ambient temperature to 220 ℃ by heat management system.

40|$|Abstract: The startability {{of diesel}} engines degrades as the ambient {{temperature}} falls, in particular, to the borderline or lower temperature. The essential cause is {{the deterioration of}} in-cylinder combustion resulting from worsening of combustion conditions. A membrane-based oxygen-enriched <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> (OEA) method is proposed to improve in-cylinder combustion and then to reduce exhaust emissions during the start-up process. This paper investigates the effects of OEA on startability and exhaust emission behaviour during the engine start-up. The experiments were carried out on a direct-injection diesel engine. A membrane-based oxygen-enrichment system was constructed to supply the test engine with <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> containing 21 vol %, 23 vol %, 25 vol %, and 27 vol % oxygen respectively. The in-cylinder pressure, instantaneous engine speed, and time-resolved engine-out emissions were recorded and com-pared for the OEA and the baseline methods (ambient air (AA), 21 vol % oxygen). The results show that, at the high <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> temperature (26 °C), the engine could start smoothly. When the <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> temperature fell to the borderline temperature (5 °C), the startability significantly degraded, in-cylinder incomplete combustion was evident during the initial stage of start-up, and the start-up time increased. With OEA at 5 °C, the startability was markedly improved, and the engine experienced fewer cycles than those at the same <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> temperature with AA before it reached idle operation. With OEA, the engine-out hydrocarbon, CO, and smoke emissions throughout the whole start-up process were all reduced considerably, but NO x emissions evidently increased...|$|R
