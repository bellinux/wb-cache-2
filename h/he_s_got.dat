40|$|Danish {{astronomy}} in {{the first}} half of the seventeenth century reflected the enduring legacy of Tycho Brahe and was dominated by his former assistant Longomontanus. This paper focuses on his successor as professor of astronomy, Jørgen From (1605 – 1651) or Georgius Frommius in the Latin version, who was also the second director of the Round Tower observatory in Copenhagen. Before becoming a professor, Frommius travelled to the Netherlands and other countries. The letters from his journey cast light on the training of a young astronomer at the time. He most likely was the first Dane to observe the heavens with a telescope. In the 1640 <b>s,</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> involved in a controversy with the French astronomer and astrologist Jean Morin, and he later contributed to Pierre Gassendi’s pioneering biography of Tycho Brahe. Although Frommius died at the age of 46, his brief career as professor and astronomer is of interest to national as well as international history of science...|$|R

A special attention was paid on the usefulness of volantary blood donor for the pervention of serum hepatitis. The results were as follows: 1. Out of 178 cases, 18 (10. 1 %) developed serum hepatitis, and 3 (1. 7 %) were jaundiced. The incidence of serum hepatitis in the subjects who recieved blood from voluntary donors was apparently {{lower than that of}} the subjects received blood from paid donors. 2. Among the causative etiology for serum hepatitis, the area of donors residence was proved to be as important as the amount of transfused blood. 3.

The donors with a previous history of viral hepatitis and elevated activity of <b>S</b> <b>GOT</b> in the same subject was rather rare, and it was scarcely found overlap of the history and abnormal <b>S</b> <b>GOT.</b> 4.

You must have something set out.
