Although commemorative dollars <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> for circulation for the visit of King George VI in 1939, no regular issue dollars <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> that year, or, as it turned out, {{until the end of}} World War II in 1945. Thereafter, Voyageur Dollars <b>were</b> <b>struck</b> each year through 1966, except in years (e.g. 1935, 1939, and 1958) when a commemorative dollar <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> for circulation.

5|$|Each enemy has a meter, {{called a}} Chain Gauge, {{consisting}} of a percentage that increases from a base level of 100 when the enemy <b>is</b> <b>struck</b> by attacks or spells. Different attacks have different effects; some raise the chain by a larger amount while others give the player longer before the Chain Gauge resets to 100 percent. The amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by the chain percentage before it {{is applied to the}} enemy. When the chain counter reaches a preset amount, different for each enemy, the enemy becomes Staggered. In this mode, the enemy has lowered defense and is easily interrupted, and some may even be launched into the air, preventing them from attacking and stopping their ATB gauges from replenishing.|$|E

500|$|The Franklin half dollar <b>was</b> <b>struck</b> in {{relatively}} small numbers {{in its first}} years, as there was limited demand due to a glut of Walking Liberty halves.

In the third season, Quinn intends to get full custody of her daughter, Beth, and her attempts to prove Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel)—the adoptive mother of Beth—an unfit mother fail; eventually, she realizes that Shelby is Beth's true mother.

She is eventually able to walk again.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the storm, the town hall in Denham was {{converted}} into a temporary shelter for the homeless. Repair to damaged roofs and downed power lines began on 22May. Within a few days of the storm's passage, appeals were made for relief funds in regions affected by Herbie. As of January 2010, Cyclone Herbie is the most recent tropical system to either directly or indirectly impact the town of Geraldton, a region that <b>is</b> <b>struck</b> by tropical cyclones once every six to eight years. Although the storm caused relatively little damage, the name Herbie was retired following its usage and will never be used again to name a tropical cyclone in the Australian region.|$|E
5|$|Later, Mulder discovers Harold {{in a room}} {{accessible}} {{from the}} bowling alley. The walls of the room are covered with score sheets, {{including those of the}} victims.

He rushes {{out of the room and}} makes his way to the bowling alley, where Angie lies dead from a heart attack. Mulder tells Scully that every person who saw the apparitions was about to die, implying that Harold may be next. Scully, who also saw a victim's ghost, <b>is</b> <b>struck</b> by the implication.|$|E
