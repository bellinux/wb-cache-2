All were built by the Manning Wardle company in Leeds. The first, named Margaret, was an 0-4-0 saddle tank with outside cylinders, while the remainder, built to <b>four</b> <b>different</b> <b>designs,</b> were 0-6-0 saddle tanks with inside cylinders. None were owned by the two railways, and five of them were auctioned at a sale of contractors' plant held at Crowle Wharf in October 1904.|$|E
5|$|The first armored cruiser, , {{was ordered}} {{shortly after the}} Victoria Louise class of {{protected}} cruisers. Fürst Bismarck was an improved version of the earlier type, with heavier armament, more extensive armor protection, and a significantly greater size. A further seven units, divided between <b>four</b> <b>different</b> <b>designs,</b> followed {{over the next ten}} years; each design provided incremental improvements over earlier vessels. A ninth armored cruiser, , was a much larger vessel representing an intermediate step between armored cruisers and battlecruisers. Indeed, her design had been influenced by the misinformation Britain had released about its s, which were then under construction. Once the characteristics of the new ships were revealed, Germany began building battlecruisers in response.|$|E

They ordered eight ships, two fully rigged seagoing types and six coastal defense ships, in March 1864. The British shipbuilder Charles Mitchell submitted <b>four</b> <b>different</b> <b>designs</b> for the coastal defense vessels, two broadside ironclads and two turret ships. The Shipbuilding Technical Committee decided in August that the broadside designs {{would be based on}} the hull shape of the earlier [...] for better seaworthiness, but they would be armed with fewer, but more powerful guns, than the numerous smoothbore guns of the older ships.

40|$|Six courses {{taught by}} the four authors at <b>four</b> <b>different</b> <b>design</b> faculties, are {{investigated}} for their use of physical models in structural education through an open-end questionnaire and peer discussions. Various characteristics of structural model applications are brought to the fore. They show that all investigated courses provide their model application within a project-based, student-centred learning. In the courses structural models are used for the student’s development of structural knowledge, but also as tools for structural design exploration in a studio setting. Through model constructing and testing, students develop sensorimotor experiences with structural behaviour which allows for higher levels of structural cognition. The paper ends with a recommendation for using physical structure models throughout the education programme starting from structure theory to design studios. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
