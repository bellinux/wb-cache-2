2500|$|When using {{glassware}} it {{is often}} necessary to control the flow of fluid. [...] It is commonly stopped with a stopper. Fluid may be transported between connected pieces of glassware. [...] Types of interconnecting components include glass tubing, [...] T-connectors, Y-connectors, and glass adapters. [...] For a leak-tight connection a ground glass joints is used (possibly reinforced using a clamping method such as a Keck clips). [...] Another way to connect glassware is with a <b>hose</b> <b>barb</b> and flexible tubing. Fluid flow can be switched selectively using a valve, of which a stopcock is a common type fused to the glassware. Valves made entirely of glass {{may be used to}} restrict fluid flows. Fluid, or any material which flows, can be directed into a narrow opening using a funnel.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Hose</b> <b>barbs</b> are {{cylindrical}} tubes with barbs used {{to attach}} hoses and flexible tubing to glassware.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} brands, {{including}} Quickfit, have begun using threaded connections for <b>hose</b> <b>barbs.</b> This allows the barb to be unscrewed from the glassware, the hose pushed {{on and the}} setup screwed back together. This helps avoid accidentally breaking the glass and potentially doing serious harm to the chemist, as will sometimes occur when pushing the hoses directly onto the glass.|$|R
50|$|Although modifying glass tubing is {{no longer}} an {{essential}} laboratory technique, many are still familiar with the basic methods. A glass cutter is used to break pieces of glass tubing into smaller pieces. Freshly cut edges are flame polished before use to remove the rough edge. Glass tubing can be bent by heating evenly over a Bunsen flame to red heat. <b>Hose</b> <b>barbs</b> can be added to tubing, giving a better grip and seal for attaching plastic or rubber tubing.|$|R
50|$|A Büchner flask, {{also known}} as a vacuum flask, filter flask, suction flask, {{side-arm}} flask or Kitasato flask, is a thick-walled Erlenmeyer flask with a short glass tube and <b>hose</b> <b>barb</b> protruding about an inch from its neck. The short tube and <b>hose</b> <b>barb</b> effectively act as an adapter over which the end of a thick-walled flexible hose (tubing) can be fitted to form a connection to the flask. The other end of the hose can be connected to source of vacuum such as an aspirator, vacuum pump, or house vacuum. Preferably this is done through a trap (see below), which is designed to prevent the sucking back of water from the aspirator into the Büchner flask.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: A Büchner funnel is {{attached}} to the flask via a black elastomer adapter. The <b>hose</b> <b>barb</b> is connected via vacuum hose to a vacuum source such as an aspirator. The flask should be clamped before use or the hose will likely cause it to tip.|$|E
50|$|The {{cheap and}} simple water {{aspirator}} {{is the most}} common type of aspirator. It is used in chemistry and biology laboratories and consists of a tee fitting attached to a tap and has a <b>hose</b> <b>barb</b> at one side. The flow of water passes through the straight portion of the tee, which has a restriction at the intersection, where the <b>hose</b> <b>barb</b> is attached. The vacuum hose should be connected to this barb. While previously common for low-strength vacuums needed in chemistry benchwork, they use a lot of water, and depending on what the vacuum is being used for, i.e. solvent removal, they can violate environmental protection laws such as RCRA by mixing these potentially hazardous solvents into the water stream, then flushing them down a drain that often leads directly to the municipal sewer.|$|E
50|$|Laboratory glassware, such as Buchner flasks and Liebig condensers, {{may have}} tubular glass tips serving as hose {{connectors}} with several ridged <b>hose</b> <b>barbs</b> around the diameter near the tip. This is {{so that the}} tips can have {{the end of a}} rubber or plastic tube mounted over them to connect the glassware to another system such as a vacuum, water supply, or drain. A special clip may be placed over the end of the flexible tube surrounding the connector tip to prevent the hose from slipping off the connector.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. The lateral {{distribution}} uniformity {{produced by}} several commercially available anhydrous ammonia (NH 3) manifold configurations was determined using a dynamic water absorption technique. For a conventional cast manifold, {{top and bottom}} inlet configurations were compared, as were open versus restricted manifold outlet barbs. Coefficient of variation for lateral distribution (lateral CVs) ranged from 15 to 20 % for the top inlet and from 8 to 10 % for the bottom inlet. For the conventional manifold, the use of open [(5. 6 mm ID (0. 22 in. ID) ] versus restrictor–type <b>hose</b> <b>barbs</b> [2. 4 mm ID (0. 09 in. ID) ] had little influence on lateral distribution. The Continental vertical dam manifold produced lateral CVs ranging from 10 to 13 %. For both manifolds, the influence of unequal discharge hose lengths was reduced as manifold pressure increased...|$|R
40|$|Follow {{the steps}} below {{to install the}} Conifer Chamber, and read the {{operational}} considerations for information on configuring the LI- 6400 software to compute leaf temperature using energy balance. Figure 2. Unscrew the knurled adjustment nut. Installation The sensor head handle must be removed to accomodate the 6400 - 05, so a tripod is usually required for making measurements. 1. Remove the male end of the leaf temperature thermocouple connec-tor by pulling straight out, and pull the air hose from {{the underside of the}} leaf chamber. 2. Unplug the log switch (not used with the conifer chamber). If the log switch wires are threaded underneath the bottom cover of the sensor head, this cover must be removed to free the log switch con-nector. a. Turn the sensor head over and remove the 3 Phillips head screws as shown in Figure 1. b. Remove the <b>hose</b> <b>barbs,</b> if necessary. You may be able to slide the cover out from underneath the hose barbs; be careful not to damage the PC board under the cover. If you remove the <b>hose</b> <b>barbs,</b> be sure and note the position of the sample and reference air hoses; the sample hose is wrapped with a piece of black shrink wrap. c. Free the wires. d. Re-assemble the cover {{on the bottom of the}} sensor head. 3. Remove the handle assembly: a. Unscrew the knurled leaf chamber adjustment nut (turn clock-wise) until it is free of the handle (Figure 2). b. With the handle latching mechanism in the closed position, wrap tape or string around the handle (where your hand would nor-mally be) so that it will stay together. Failure to do so may result in the spring coming out. Leave the handle secured in this manner. c. Remove the 2 screws (3 on some instruments) on the back side of the handle, as shown in Figure 3, using a # 1 Phillips head screwdriver. Figure 1. Remove the 3 screws on the sensor head bottom cover...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A Bunsen burner with needle valve. The <b>hose</b> <b>barb</b> for the {{gas tube}} {{is on the left}} and the needle valve for gas flow {{adjustment}} is on the opposite side. The air inlet on this particular model is adjusted by rotating the barrel, thus opening or closing the vertical baffles at the base.|$|E
5000|$|Hose barbs are {{cylindrical}} pieces {{or parts}} for attaching and securing of hoses (tubing). The barb-like rings on the cylindrical piece allow {{for an easy}} push-connection of flexible-plastic or rubber tubing that is not so easily disconnected. Hose barbs are used in machine perfusion and chemistry laboratory equipment. <b>Hose</b> <b>barb</b> fittings are small curved, bent or T-shaped pipes, hoses or tubes with hose barbs {{on at least one}} side used to join two or more pieces of piping (hosing, tubing) together.|$|E
50|$|A barb (or <b>hose</b> <b>barb),</b> which connects {{flexible}} hose or tubing to pipes, typically has a male-threaded end which mates with female threads. The {{other end of}} the fitting has a single- or multi-barbed tube—a long tapered cone with ridges, which is inserted into a {{flexible hose}}. An adjustable worm drive screw clamp (or other type of clamp) is often added, to keep the hose from slipping off the barbed tube. Barb fittings can be made of brass for hot-water applications, and plastic may be used for cold water; brass is considered more durable for heavy-duty use. The barb fitting may be elbow-shaped or straight.|$|E
50|$|The other {{goal of a}} {{hose clamp}} is to provide {{mechanical}} attachment keeping the hose attached to a <b>barb,</b> <b>hose</b> nipple, or tube. To do this the clamp is typically placed on the hose behind the first ramp of the barb or behind the raised area {{near the end of}} and completely around the circumference of the hose nipple or tube called a bead. If the hose were to slide the clamp would have to expand to fit over the barb or raised bead. This keeps the hose attached to the <b>barb,</b> <b>hose</b> nipple, or beaded tube.|$|R
50|$|To {{ensure a}} good seal, the <b>barb,</b> <b>hose</b> nipple, or beaded tube must be smooth {{and free of}} nicks, scratches, or contamination. Stuck hoses should never be removed by {{slitting}} them, as this can leave a scratch on the fitting which will cause a leak.|$|R
50|$|Spring clamps are {{typically}} {{made from a}} strip of spring steel, cut so that one side has a narrow protrusion centered on the end, {{and the other side}} a pair of narrow protrusions on either side. The ends of these protrusions are then bent outwards, and the strip rolled to form a ring, with the protruding tabs intermeshing. To use the clamp, the exposed tabs are pressed towards each other (typically using pliers), increasing the diameter of the ring, and the clamp is slid onto the hose, past the portion that will go onto the <b>barb.</b> The <b>hose</b> is then fit onto the barb, the clamp expanded again, slid onto the portion of the <b>hose</b> over the <b>barb,</b> then released, compressing the <b>hose</b> onto the <b>barb.</b> Clamps of this design are rarely used for high pressures or large hoses, as they would require unwieldy amounts of steel to generate enough clamping force, and be impossible to work with using just hand tools. They are commonly used on automotive cooling system hoses several inches in diameter, for example on most water-cooled Volkswagen automobiles.|$|R
50|$|The <b>hose</b> <b>barb</b> is {{connected}} to a gas nozzle on the laboratory bench with rubber tubing. Most laboratory benches are equipped with multiple gas nozzles connected to a central gas source, as well as vacuum, nitrogen, and steam nozzles. The gas then flows up through the base through a small hole {{at the bottom of}} the barrel and is directed upward. There are open slots in the side of the tube bottom to admit air into the stream using the Venturi effect, and the gas burns at the top of the tube once ignited by a flame or spark. The most common methods of lighting the burner are using a match or a spark lighter.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{upgrades}} {{available for the}} ProMaster. One upgrade that must be bought immediately is a bottom line setup, {{the most popular of}} these being an on/off valve style ASA (Air Source Adaptor) with a macroline hose. Any 45 style grips will fit it and all Autococker/Intimidator barrels will work as well. The feedneck is threaded into the body and can be replaced with any Bushmaster-style feed neck, such as the feednecks manufactured by AKALMP, CCM and ICDU. Another very popular upgrade among ProMaster users is the Indian Creek Designs Underground Cylinder Assembly. It consists of a new cylinder and ram unit as well as a Quick Exhaust Valve, or QEV and <b>hose</b> <b>barb.</b> The low pressure regulator pressure can be dropped significantly after this upgrade. This increases the ProMaster's air efficiency and cycle speed as well as reducing the amount of recoil felt when firing. Another advantage to adding the ICDU cylinder is the hammer can be removed {{out of the back of}} the gun, resulting in an easier maintenance process for the user. Other popular upgrades are replacement high pressure regulators, low pressure regulators and valves that offer higher air flow and consistency, resulting in higher paintball velocities at lower air pressures, thus increasing the ProMaster's efficiency. Aftermarket Micro-processor circuit boards are available from NOX, Kila Products and Vaporworks. The ProMaster shares the same circuit board type as the newer ICD Freestyles. Yet another popular upgrade is widely available on www.ebay.com. It is a delrin bolt link pin, which links the bolt to the ram hammer. It is very popular because it is light in weight, prevents scratching of the body and, is very inexpensive compared to most other upgrades available for the ProMaster. Delrin bolts are also available, however the stock bolt has proven to be a strong point of the gun because it is also made of delrin and no evidence of performance gains has been shown with the use of an upgraded bolt. New high flow solenoid valves are also available from ICDU website as well as Airsoldier.com ...|$|E
30|$|Shake flask {{cultivation}} of delignified straw were also conducted {{in order to}} determine the efficacy of F. oxysporum in producing ethanol from it. The culture conditions were not as above; those described by Christakopoulos et al. (1991 a) were used in order to compare yields with those previously reported for other strains of F. oxysporum. In brief, fungal inoculum was grown aerobically in a 250 ml Büchner flask containing 50 ml minimal medium and 1 % (wv- 1) alkali treated cellulose and 0.15 % (wv- 1) wheat bran as carbon sources. After 3 days, cultures were amended with 1.5 g of dry-sterilised alkali-treated wheat straw and grown under oxygen-limiting condition for 4 - 6 days. For switching from aerobic to oxygen-limiting condition inside the flask, the cotton plugs were replaced with a rubber bung and sealed with paraflim while the <b>hose</b> <b>barb</b> was fitted with a silicon tube and the end was dipped in water filled beaker.|$|E
5000|$|Another type {{of spring}} clamp, {{typically}} only used on vacuum hoses, {{is just a}} piece of spring steel wire bent into a loop, with the ends curled to provide handles. These are used similar to standard spring clamps, but are just pinched by hand, and provide very little clamping force. Rather than attempting to seal a <b>hose</b> into a <b>barb,</b> they just place a slight pressure on the hose, helping to keep it from sliding off the barb.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{fundamental}} goals of most hose clamps is to ensure a tight seal between the <b>hose</b> and the <b>barb,</b> preventing the working fluid from escaping. To this goal, {{they are designed to}} provide even pressure on all sides, with no gaps. An example of this would be wire clamps. An obvious design would seem to be simply having a wire around the hose, one end attached to a nut, and the other end to the screw, and when tightened, pulling the ends of the wire towards each other. However, this will leave a gap where no pressure is applied (underneath the screw), and cause a leak. To combat this, the more complicated and weaker design of having the ends overlap and then be pushed apart from each other is used, as this ensures pressure around the entire circumference of the hose.|$|R
