Alongside fire, other hazards included the hoops being caught in machinery, carriage wheels, gusts of wind, or other obstacles.|$|E

25|$|<b>Hooping</b> (also called hula <b>hooping</b> or <b>hoop</b> dance) {{generally}} {{refers to}} manipulation of and artistic movement or dancing with a <b>hoop</b> (or <b>hoops).</b> <b>Hoops</b> {{can be made}} of metal, wood, or plastic. <b>Hooping</b> combines technical moves and tricks with freestyle or technical dancing. <b>Hooping</b> can be practiced to or performed with music. In contrast to the classic toy hula <b>hoop,</b> modern hoopers use heavier and larger diameter <b>hoops,</b> and frequently rotate the <b>hoop</b> around {{parts of the body}} other than the waist, including the hips, chest, neck, shoulders, thighs, knees, arms, hands, thumbs, feet, and toes. The <b>hoop</b> can also be manipulated and rotated off the body as well. Modern <b>hooping</b> has been influenced by art forms such as rhythmic gymnastics, hip-hop, freestyle dance, fire performance, twirling, poi, and other dance and movement forms.|$|R

5|$|Shamrock Rovers wore {{green and}} white striped jerseys until 1926, when they adopted the {{green and white}} <b>hooped</b> strip that they have worn ever since. Their club badge has {{featured}} a football and a shamrock throughout their history. The club has a relatively large support base and shares an intense rivalry with Bohemian Football Club. On 26 August 2011 Rovers became the first Irish side to reach the group stages of either of the top two European competitions by beating Partizan Belgrade in the play-off round of the Europa League.|$|E
5|$|Until 1926, Shamrock Rovers wore {{green and}} white striped jerseys but {{following}} a suggestion by a committee member, John Sheridan, the club chose to adopt the {{green and white}} <b>hooped</b> strip. A close relationship existed between the club and Belfast Celtic {{and it was on}} account of this that the idea was formed. The first game featuring the new jerseys was against Bray Unknowns in a FAI Cup match on 9 January 1927 at Shelbourne Park. The Hoops lost the game 3–0 and senior members of the club considered abandoning the new strip. Despite this loss, the team continued to wear green and white hoops and have done ever since. The 2007 season was the first season since the hoops were introduced that they were not continuous around {{the main body of the}} jersey. The style of the shirt sleeves has been changed on numerous occasions. The away colours of the club have varied over time. In the early 1980s, the club had a yellow away jersey. In the mid-1990s, a <b>hooped</b> purple jersey was adopted. In 2011, the team wore an all black away strip.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, {{just before the}} {{outbreak}} of World War II, there was {{a revival of the}} <b>hooped</b> crinoline from designers such as Edward Molyneux, who put hoops in both day skirts and evening gowns, and Norman Hartnell, whose late 1930s Winterhalter-inspired crinoline designs for Queen Elizabeth were so successful that the Queen is popularly (if inaccurately) credited with having single-handedly brought crinolines back into fashion. Both as Queen, and as the Queen Mother, Elizabeth adopted the traditional bell-shaped crinoline as her signature look for evening wear and state occasions. The film Gone With The Wind, released in 1939, inspired the American fashion for prom dresses with crinolines in Spring 1940.|$|E

5|$|In some contexts, the {{traditional}} <b>hooped</b> crinoline {{may be seen}} as controversial, as in early 2015 when the University of Georgia reportedly requested hoop skirts not be worn to certain fraternity events due to their perceived association with Southern Belles and the slave-owning, upper socioeconomic classes of the American Deep South. The reason for the proposed ban was linked to the SAE racism incident earlier that year, with several articles noting it was a well-intentioned attempt to avoid the University of Georgia fraternities facing charges of racial insensitivity. It was noted that hoop skirts and crinolines had been worn by both black and white women of all classes and social standings during the historical period in question, and that despite popular associations, they were not exclusive to the image of the Southern Belle.|$|E
