40|$|Abstract Joint {{geometry}} measurement {{is a key}} {{task for}} welding automation. Among the sensors used for this purpose, the Laser Triangulation Sensors for welding (LTS) {{are the ones that}} best characterize the joint geometry. Root <b>gap</b> <b>measurement</b> is especially important for success in the automated root pass deposition, with production and quality benefits in different applications, such as pipeline construction for the Oil & Gas industry. The measurement of this feature is sensitive to noises generated by welding and joint surface reflexivity. The image processing algorithms for <b>gap</b> <b>measurement</b> available in literature do not have the desired characteristics of measurement error and flexibility for dimensional variability of welding joints. This paper presents a new algorithm for root <b>gap</b> <b>measurement</b> of “V” type joints using a linear adjustment technique. This developed algorithm was evaluated from measurement errors found in images captured before and during orbital welding procedure of a standard test piece. The same images were processed with pattern correlation algorithm and derivative algorithm, both presented in academic papers. The proposed algorithm presented the best results of measurement error, robustness and flexibility...|$|E

40|$|This study {{uses the}} hybrid DEA model, {{in which the}} {{proportionate}} inputs are evaluated with a radial measure and the non-proportionate inputs are evaluated with a non-radial measure in order to evaluate the impact of marketing expense on the efficiency of Taiwan's international tourist hotels. We further introduce the hybrid DEA into the technology <b>gap</b> <b>measurement</b> to evaluate the technology gaps of marketing expense utilization between different operating types. The empirical {{results indicate that the}} inefficiency caused from excess marketing expense is the main reason for lower efficiency in many tourist hotels, especially to chain-operated hotels and hotels that cater to domestic clients.

The data provides not only the price information but also the recent sales volume for each seller. It shows that {{price dispersion}} does not diminish over time. Although I draw the same conclusion as the research on US market using the <b>gap</b> <b>measurement</b> between the two lists with lowest prices, I find the <b>gap</b> <b>measurement</b> itself is not an effective indicator.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a systematic study that evaluates the feasibility {{and reliability of}} local band <b>gap</b> <b>measurements</b> of Cu(In,Ga) Se 2 thin films by valence electron energy-loss spectroscopy (VEELS). The compositional gradients across the Cu(In,Ga) Se 2 layer cause variations in the band gap energy, which are experimentally determined using a monochromated {{scanning transmission electron microscope}} (STEM). The results reveal the expected band gap variation across the Cu(In,Ga) Se 2 layer and therefore confirm the feasibility of local band <b>gap</b> <b>measurements</b> of Cu(In,Ga) Se 2 by VEELS. The precision and accuracy of the results are discussed based on the analysis of individual error sources, which leads {{to the conclusion that the}} precision of our measurements is most limited by the acquisition reproducibility, if the signal-to-noise ratio of the spectrum is high enough. Furthermore, we simulate the impact of radiation losses on the measured band gap value and propose a thickness-dependent correction. In future work, localized band gap variations will be measured on a more localized length scale to investigate, e. g., the influence of chemical inhomogeneities and dopant accumulations at grain boundarie...|$|R

40|$|We study {{whether the}} {{accuracy}} of real-time estimates of the output gap produced by the OECD has improved over time by examining a panel dataset on real-time output gap revisions for 15 countries from 1991 Q 1 - 2005 Q 4.
