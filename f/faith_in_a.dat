5|$|The winter had {{political}} ramifications {{and caused}} {{the public to}} lose <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Labour government who could not maintain food and electricity supplies. Long-time Labour activist Manny Shinwell {{was in charge of}} the coal supply. He repeatedly denied there were problems. He blamed the climate, the railway system, or capitalism generally. The cabinet had to take control away from him and he became the scapegoat.|$|E
5|$|With {{the support}} of the population, Van der Noot {{launched}} a persecution of Vonckists known as the Statist Terror (Statistisch Schrikbewind). Verlooy and Vandermersh were arrested and imprisoned. Vonck and his remaining supporters forced into exile in Lille where they tried to raise opposition to the Statists but in vain. Faced with an increasingly reactionary government in the United Belgian States, many of the exiled Vonckists felt that they had more to gain from negotiating with Leopold II than with the revolutionaries. Amid rumours of Austrian military forces nearing Belgium, the Statists put their <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> foreign military intervention and began lobbying the Prussians, who were believed to be sympathetic, for support.|$|E

5|$|Arroway falls {{unconscious}} as {{she begins}} traveling back through a wormhole. She awakens {{to find herself}} {{on the floor of}} the pod, the mission control team repeatedly hailing her. She learns that, from outside the machine, it appears the pod merely dropped through the machine's rings and landed in a safety net. Arroway insists that she was gone for approximately 18 hours, but her recording devices show only static. A Congressional Committee is formed and speculates that the Vega signal and machine were a hoax designed by the now-deceased Hadden. Although she cannot prove it happened, Arroway asks the committee to accept the truth of her testimony on <b>faith.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> private conversation, Kitz and White House official Rachel Constantine reflect on confidential information that, although Arroway's recording device only recorded static, it recorded 18 hours of it. Arroway and Joss reunite, and Arroway receives ongoing financial support to expand the SETI program.|$|E
5|$|When Joan {{comes to}} speak with Charles, the Dauphin pretends to be a common member of the court while someone else pretends to be him. Joan is able {{to see through the}} ruse and {{immediately}} proclaims that she is sent to restore the French crown to him at Rheims. Charles has her examined by priests and scholars to determine that she is free of black magic. While questioned, Joan describes how God came to her with visions and describes her <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> similar manner to deism. This causes the examiners to believe that she is a heretic until a blue flame appears along with a sound, which is enough to silence any doubts about her faith. The flame reveals a suit of armour for her, but one individual interrupts her immediate donning of the armour to claim that France is cursed and that she would be a victim. The individual, as it turns out, is Conrade, who blames himself that Joan left her peaceful life to help a French court that was corrupt. He also warns her that he experienced a vision of her burning at the stake.|$|E

25|$|The lecture was {{claimed by}} many Catholic apologists {{to not be}} {{directed}} at Islam at all and the incendiary passages were purely circumstantial to the lecture's real intention, which was to counter the demotion of theology in the university environment in particular and of <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> society plagued by postmodern relativism and irrationality in general.|$|E

25|$|Many Humanists adopt {{principles}} of the Golden Rule. Some believe that universal moral standards are required for the proper functioning of society.

25|$|In 1860, both Chinese and Westerners {{would place}} more <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small, motley group of mercenaries than readily {{available}} local citizenry, because the average Chinese {{of the time}} had little understanding of marksmanship, nor much impetus to defend the Manchu throne. Further, with Taiping armies edging closer to Shanghai, {{there was no time}} to train native peasants in either conventional Chinese or Western warfare.|$|E
25|$|Franklin {{formulated}} {{a presentation}} of his beliefs and published it in 1728. It did not mention many of the Puritan ideas as regards belief in salvation, the divinity of Jesus, and indeed most religious dogma. He clarified himself as a deist in his 1771 autobiography, although he still considered himself a Christian. He retained a strong <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> God as the wellspring of morality and goodness in man, and as a Providential actor in history responsible for American independence.|$|E

In 1898, Clawson was {{appointed}} to the church’s Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, the second highest ecclesiastical body in the church, a position he held until his death in 1943. Clawson’s high profile life in Utah, and among Mormons generally, gave opportunity for commentators to look to the events in his life that may have shaped his <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> God and his commitment to the church. He was regularly asked {{to tell the story of}} Standing’s death, and references were made to the event by church leaders in conferences of the church for decades. The story of Rudger Clawson can not be separated from the story of Standing.|$|E

25|$|Charles Taylor, in his 2007 book A Secular Age, {{showed the}} {{historical}} role of deism, leading {{to what he}} calls an exclusive humanism. This humanism invokes a moral order, whose ontic commitment is wholly intra-human, with no reference to transcendence. One of the special achievements of such deism-based humanism is that it discloses new, anthropocentric moral sources by which human beings are motivated and empowered to accomplish acts of mutual benefit. This is the province of a buffered, disengaged self, which is the locus of dignity, freedom and discipline, and is endowed with a sense of human capability. According to Taylor, by the early 19th century this deism-mediated exclusive humanism developed as an alternative to Christian <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> personal God and an order of miracles and mystery.|$|E
25|$|Haig {{crossed over}} to Le Havre.

Haig was irritated by Sir John French (influenced by Henry Wilson into putting his <b>faith</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> French thrust up from the Ardennes) who was only concerned with the three German corps {{in front of the}} BEF at Mons and who ignored intelligence reports of German forces streaming westwards from Brussels, threatening an encirclement from the British left. Although II Corps fought off the German attack at Mons on 23 August (the first British encounter with the Germans) the BEF was forced to withdraw after Lanzerac ordered a retreat exposing their right flank as well.|$|E
