The front, or 'head' of a debris-flow surge often contains an abundance of coarse material such as boulders and logs that impart {{a great deal of}} friction. Trailing behind the high-friction flow head is a lower-friction, mostly liquefied <b>flow</b> <b>body</b> that contains a higher percentage of sand, silt and clay. These fine sediments help retain high pore-fluid pressures that enhance debris-flow mobility.

Debris flows tend to move in a series of pulses, or discrete surges, wherein each pulse or surge has a distinctive head, body and tail.|$|E

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} the production of a metal <b>flow</b> <b>body,</b> particularly a wing, which is produced from a metal sheet and a support structure. According to the method, a drop-like hollow cylinder is created by shaping a flat metal sheet into a wing profile, the interior of the hollow cylinder being provided with a stiffening structure to support the hollow cylindrical shape. The <b>flow</b> <b>body</b> is finally formed by internal hydroforming, and therefore tight tolerances can be maintained. Tolerance compensation by removing or adding material is unnecessary. Tolerance compensation for the interior structure and the exterior shell is accomplished simultaneously by shaping. Final forming means the adjustment of the ultimate flow-relevant shape of the <b>flow</b> <b>body.</b> Internal hydroforming also makes it possible to form additional fine structures such as riblets, whale fins and/or a structure similar to a fish skin in the exterior shell or on the <b>flow</b> <b>body,</b> whereby flow resistance can be reduced and thus the fuel consumption or flow efficiency can be improved...|$|E

30|$|We {{examined}} the temporal {{changes in the}} internal stresses and pore fluid pressures of a submarine mass transport deposit (MTD) in the Akkeshi Formation of the Upper Cretaceous–Paleocene Nemuro Group, eastern Hokkaido Island, Japan. We first analyzed previous paleostress field results from meso-scale faults in the MTD blocks, which indicated two phases during {{the evolution of the}} debris flow: phase I, radial spreading of the <b>flow</b> <b>body</b> during downslope movement; phase II, the <b>flow</b> <b>body</b> underwent compression during deposition on the basin plain. We also estimated the pore fluid pressure ratio from the fault orientation distribution. There was a large increase in the pore fluid pressure ratio during the transition from phase I to phase II that continued to rise during the initial stage of phase II and then decreased in its latter stages, whereas the maximum horizontal compressive stress increased throughout phase II. This variation in pore fluid pressure relates to the dynamics and evolution of the debris flow, where the clasts in {{the central part of the}} flow were supported by the excess pore pressure due to the compression of the debris flow as the flow head decelerated. Although pore fluid pressure plays a critical role in the dynamics of debris flows, there was no previous methodology to quantify both the stress fields and pore fluid pressures in large debris flows and their resultant MTDs. Our results implemented for outcrop studies imply that meso-scale faults in MTDs can provide clues to better understand these paleoflow mechanisms.|$|E

40|$|The 12 to 13 July 2003 {{andesite}} lava dome collapse at the Soufrière Hills volcano, Montserrat, {{provides the}} first opportunity to document comprehensively both the sub-aerial and submarine sequence of events for an eruption. Numerous pyroclastic flows entered the ocean during the collapse, depositing approximately 90 % of the total material into the submarine environment. During peak collapse conditions, as the main flow penetrated the air–ocean interface, phreatic explosions were observed and a surge cloud decoupled from the main <b>flow</b> <b>body</b> to travel 2 to 3 km over the ocean surface before settling. The bulk of the flow was submerged and rapidly mixed with sea water forming a water-saturated mass flow. Efficient sorting and physical differentiation occurred within the flow before initial deposition at 500 m water depth. The coarsest components (? 60 % of the total volume) were deposited proximally from a dense granular flow, while the finer components (? 40 %) were efficiently elutriated into the overlying part of the flow, which evolved into a far-reaching turbidity current. <br/...|$|E
40|$|A semimicroscopic {{derivation}} {{is presented}} of {{equations of motion}} for the density and the flow velocity of concentrated systems of entangled polymers. The essential ingredient is the transient force that results from perturbations of overlapping polymers due to flow. A Smoluchowski equation is derived that includes these transient forces. From this, an equation of motion for the polymer number density is obtained, in which body forces couple {{the evolution of the}} polymer density to the local velocity field. Using a semimicroscopic Ansatz for the dynamics of the number of entanglements between overlapping polymers, and for the perturbations of the pair-correlation function due to <b>flow,</b> <b>body</b> forces are calculated for nonuniform systems where the density as well as the shear rate varies with position. Explicit expressions are derived for the shear viscosity and normal forces, as well as for nonlocal contributions to the body force, such as the shear-curvature viscosity. A contribution to the equation of motion for the density is found that describes mass transport due to spatial variation of the shear rate. The two coupled equations of motion for the density and flow velocity predict flow instabilities that will be discussed in more detail in a forthcoming publication...|$|E

The body motions during the landing and the hydrodynamic loads acting on the body surface are of primary interest. The process of the inclined impact {{can be divided into}} two phases.

40|$|Hydraulic model {{tests and}} flume {{experiments}} for mountainous torrents and rivers {{have been conducted}} to clarify flow characteristics for many kinds of sediment movement modes such as mud flow, debris flow and so on. Especially, in case of mud flows and sediment laden flows with wide sediment grain size distribution, there are problems to be solved for not only similarity in experimental approach, but also flow model and constitutive relationship in numerical simulation. In flume tests, coarse sediment particles can reproduce sediment erosion/deposition in those flow regimes, focusing on that locally spatial and time averaged bed variation is formed mainly by bedloads. However, it can be quite difficult to reproduce turbulent flow with fine sediment particles in model flume. In case of mud flows, modeling and treatments for muddy <b>flow</b> <b>body</b> which is liquid-phase are still now difficult and coarse sediment particles {{can be regarded as}} particles with small specific weight in comparison to sand. Additionally, in case of sediment laden flows with nonuniform sediment, it can be important to consider how to reproduce wide grain size distribution of sediment particles in model. It can be better that artificial material is used in place of sand particles based on Froude and dimensionless bed shear stress similarity to reproduce several sediment transport modes.
