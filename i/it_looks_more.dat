25|$|A rock {{arch and}} several notable bluffs are formed of late Whaingaroan Ahirau Sandstone formed about 28 million years ago. Although {{classified}} as sandstone, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> like limestone, with 40-60% calcium carbonate content and lapiez features in massive (lacking internal structures), blue-grey, calcareous, fine sandstone.|$|E
25|$|The rostrum (snout) {{is unlike}} that of undisputed crown mammals; in fact <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> {{like that of a}} pelycosaur, such as Dimetrodon. The multituberculate rostrum is box-like, with the large flat maxillae forming the sides, the nasal the top, and the tall premaxilla at the front.|$|E
25|$|Die {{deterioration}} doubling is {{a result}} of a few simple causes, but {{it can be difficult to}} positively identify. There are a number of different features which appear similar, but the characteristic traits of each are easy to identify with practice. Die deterioration doubling is often mistaken for hub doubling. The causes of the two types of doubling are different, but their appearance on the finished coin is often similar. Die deterioration doubling appears most often around the mintmark and date because they are alone in the field. When it occurs in other features, like an image of a bust, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> like a weak strike than doubling.|$|E

2500|$|Opponents of dam removal {{have pointed}} out that the {{flooding}} of the Hetch Hetchy Valley has also deterred the crowds that overrun other areas of Yosemite National Park. Indeed, Hetch Hetchy today remains the least visited area of the park. Karin Klein has described Yosemite Valley as [...] "so crammed... that <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> like a ripstop ghetto than the site of a nature experience." [...] However, she does support breaching the dam once it has reached the end of its lifespan, and not replacing it.|$|E

60|$|This Tale tells but indifferently, tho' indeed <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> like a Christian Fable, than a Pagan; {{because it}} seems as if made to honour the Christian Worship, and blast all the Pagan Idolatry; and for that Reason I reject it, the Christian Profession needing no such fabulous Stuff to confirm it.|$|E

6000|$|Marsa (anchorage) Damghah,[FN#10] {{or rather}} Dumayghah, is {{scarcely}} {{visible from the}} sea. An islet of limestone rock defends the entrance, leaving a narrow passage to the south. It is not before he enters that the mariner discovers the extent {{and the depth of}} this creek, which indents far into the land, and offers 15 to 20 feet of fine clear anchorage which no swell can reach. Inside <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> like a lake, and at night its colour is gloriously blue as Geneva itself. I could not help calling to mind, after dinner, the old school lines ...|$|E

"I {{dare say}} he's got {{good reason to}} cover his ears, like King Midas," [...] went on the priest, with a cheerful {{simplicity}} which somehow seemed rather flippant under the circumstances. [...] "I can quite understand that it's nicer to cover them with hair than with brass plates or leather flaps. But {{if he wants to}} use hair, why doesn't he make it look like hair? There never was hair of that colour in this world. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> like a sunset-cloud coming through the wood. Why doesn't he conceal the family curse better, if he's really so ashamed of it? Shall I tell you? It's because he isn't ashamed of it. He's proud of it" ...|$|E
60|$|At Aberystwyth, and {{elsewhere}} in Wales, {{one of the things}} I noticed was the difference of the people from the people over the English border in their attitude toward their betters. They might stand only five feet in their stockings, but they stood straight, and if they were respectful, they were first self-respectful. In our run from Shrewsbury, their language first made itself generally heard at Newport, and it increased in the unutterable names of the stations westward, the farther we passed into their beautiful country, but they had always English enough to be civil, though never servile. The country is beautiful in the New England measure, but it is of a softer and smaller beauty; <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> caressable; it is like Vermont rather than New Hampshire, and it is more like New England than Old England in the greater number of isolated farm-houses, from which the girls as well as the boys come to the university colleges for learning undreamt of by English farm villagers.|$|E

5000|$|The Water Tower - may {{be mistaken}} for a {{battlefield}} look-out point but was only used to hold water. The top of the tower {{is an example of a}} crenellated adornment, making <b>it</b> <b>look</b> <b>more</b> like a castle than the roof of a water tower.|$|R
5|$|The Wembley Stadium {{scene in}} the film 28 Weeks Later was {{actually}} filmed at the Millennium Stadium. Although the outside is footage of Wembley, the inside is all filmed in Cardiff.

60|$|Now, by all odds, {{the most}} ancient extant {{portrait}} anyways purporting to be the whale's, {{is to be found}} in the famous cavern-pagoda of Elephants, in India. The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits, every conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any of them actually came into being. No wonder then, that in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth. The Hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate department of the wall, depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan, learnedly known as the Matse Avatar. But though this sculpture is half man and half whale, so as only to give the tail of the latter, yet that small section of him is all wrong. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> like the tapering tail of an anaconda, than the broad palms of the true whale's majestic flukes.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Tis a goodly castle for its size," [...] {{the knight}} said, {{as he drew}} rein and turned his horse so that his dame might {{get a better view}} of it. [...] "There is a dry moat, which is lined with stonework. The walls are not very high, but they are well defended by those {{flanking}} towers, and the place could stand any sudden assault. I should say that it was about the same strength as our own. So far as I can see, the other arrangements are quite different. There is no keep, {{and it seems to me}} that the house is built rather for comfort than for defence; the windows are large, and <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>more</b> like a Flemish house built within a castle wall than an English place of strength. Now let us ride on," [...] and they pressed their horses forward. The gates were thrown open when they approached within a hundred yards; the drawbridge over the moat had been already lowered.|$|E
6000|$|And now, {{what is to}} be said to Mr. Harrison's {{remarkable}} deliverance [...] "On {{the future}} of agnosticism [...] "?[63] I would that it were not my business to say anything, for I am afraid I can say nothing which shall manifest my great personal respect for this able writer, and for the zeal and energy with which he ever and anon galvanises the weakly frame of Positivism until <b>it</b> <b>looks,</b> <b>more</b> than ever, like John Bunyan's Pope and Pagan rolled into one. There is a story often repeated, and I am afraid none the less mythical on that account, of a valiant and loud-voiced corporal in command of two full privates who, falling in with a regiment of the enemy in the dark, orders it to surrender under pain of instant annihilation by his force; and the enemy surrenders accordingly. I am always reminded of this tale when I read the positivist commands to the forces of Christianity and of Science; only the enemy show no more signs of intending to obey now than they have done any time these forty years.|$|E

Miss Spencer {{lived in}} the fourth house beyond the [...] "Baptist church; the Baptist church was {{the one on the}} right, with that queer green thing over the door; they called it a portico, but <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> like an old-fashioned bedstead.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, I {{have got}} the trap out at the Greyhound,' said Bob. 'I don't know whether it will hold your luggage and us too; but <b>it</b> <b>looked</b> <b>more</b> respectable than the waggon on a Sunday, and if there's not room for the boxes I can walk alongside.' ...|$|R
60|$|There was no {{illumination}} of {{the windows}} tonight. From roof to basement not a light twinkled {{in any part of}} the great building.
