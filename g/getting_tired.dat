25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s {{the policy of}} Don Javier and Fal Conde, dubbed javierismo or falcondismo, was {{increasingly}} contested within the Comunión. The Sivattistas pressed for terminating the regency and for Don Javier to declare himself the king. They suspected that the overdue regency was an element of Don Javier’s policy towards Franco; according to them, the regent intended to ensure the crown for the Bourbon-Parma by means of appeasement rather than by means of open challenge. In particular they were enraged by allegedly ambiguous stand versus the proposed Francoist , considering it an unacceptable backing of the regime. On the other hand, the possibilists were <b>getting</b> <b>tired</b> of what they perceived as ineffective intransigence and lack of legal outposts, recommending more flexible attitude. Especially following the 1949 news about Franco’s negotiations with Don Juan, Don Javier found himself under pressure to assume a more active stance.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Sufjan Stevens {{released}} {{an album of}} extra material left over from Illinois (originally conceived as a double album), titled , {{as well as an}} album of Christmas music titled Songs for Christmas (produced in parts between 2001 and 2006). Following the release of The Avalanche, Stevens expressed a dissatisfaction with his music, stating in an interview with Pitchfork in 2006: [...] "I'm <b>getting</b> <b>tired</b> of my voice. I'm <b>getting</b> <b>tired</b> of ... the banjo. I'm <b>getting</b> <b>tired</b> of ... the trumpet". In 2009 Stevens admitted that his Fifty States Project—an attempt to write an album for each of the 50 U.S. States—had been a [...] "promotional gimmick" [...] and not something that he had seriously intended to complete. In the same year he released The BQE, an orchestral suite accompanying a home-made film dedicated to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. In an interview with BeatRoute Magazine in 2010, Stevens stated [...] " [...] kinda sabotaged the mechanical way of approaching my music, which was basically narrative long-form. It really opened things up for me. It also confused things as well. I don’t think I ever really fully recovered from that process". On August 20, 2010, without prior announcement, Stevens released the EP All Delighted People, and less than one week later, announced The Age of Adz to be released on October 12.|$|E

[...] Elder considered the stories to be the funniest of his collaborations with Kurtzman, though he said that {{towards the end of}} the run he was <b>getting</b> <b>tired</b> of the painstaking work he put into the drawings.

500|$|Maurice Richardson, in The Observer, thought You Only Live Twice [...] "though {{far from}} the best Bond, is really almost as easy to read as any of them". He was {{critical}} {{of a number of}} aspects, saying that the [...] "narrative is a bit weak, action long delayed and disappointing when it comes but the surround of local colour... has been worked over with that unique combination of pubescent imagination and industry which is Mr. Fleming's speciality." [...] In The Guardian, Francis Iles wrote that [...] "I think he [...] must be <b>getting</b> <b>tired</b> of the ineffable James Bond and perhaps even of writing thrillers at all". Iles reasoned that [...] "of the 260 pages of You Only Live Twice...only 60 are concerned with the actual business of a thriller", and his enjoyment was further diminished by what he considered [...] "the grossness of Bond's manners and his schoolboy obscenities".|$|E
500|$|By 1971, the {{projected}} start of construction had slipped to within {{three to four}} years from then; however, Caltrans had approved the project. In July1974, the California Coastal Commission unanimously decided to halt the entire project, since many of the necessary approvals from governmental bodies had not been obtained; this overrode an exemption granted by the San Diego Coast Regional Commission. Both the mayors of Chula Vista and National City were dismayed; Mayor Kile Morgan of National City stated that [...] "we in the South Bay are <b>getting</b> <b>tired</b> of being kicked around", in reference to other stalled projects such as SR 157 and SR125. Meanwhile, the interchange at I-805 was under construction, with completion scheduled for the next year. A U.S. Fish and Wildlife report predicted that the project would destroy [...] of marshland and harm three bird species that were endangered, among other negative environmental consequences; the conclusions were disputed by local officials.|$|E

[...] She has said that riding [...] "saved my life", explaining that, [...] "I was losing most of the function of my right side. And I decided I needed to go back and do what I loved before I couldn't do it anymore." [...] At first she could barely stay on a horse without <b>getting</b> <b>tired,</b> but gradually the muscle control required for riding proved directly beneficial, and psychologically, [...] "Riding exhilarated me; it gave me a joy and a purpose. When I was so fatigued that I couldn't move, the excitement of going to the barn and getting my foot in the stirrup would make me crawl out of bed." [...] As a result, she said, [...] "My desire to ride was, and is, so strong that I kept getting healthier and healthier." ...|$|E
500|$|On Stranger Tides {{also had}} {{positive}} reviews; some critics found {{the film to}} be entertaining and well-made. Richard Roeper gave the film a B+, describing it as [...] "the most fun installment since the first", calling the story [...] "pure cartoon, but {{a lot easier to}} follow than the other sequels", and summing as [...] "the franchise is <b>getting</b> <b>tired,</b> but Penelope energizes it." [...] Along the same lines, Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post gave the film three out of four stars, writing that it [...] "feels as fresh and bracingly exhilarating as the day Jack Sparrow first swashed his buckle, infusing new reckless energy into a franchise that shows no signs of furling its sails". She said that Marshall [...] "swiftly and without fuss delivers the action set pieces and eye-popping escapism" [...] and praised Depp, Cruz, and McShane's performances. Ray Bennett from The Hollywood Reporter considered that Marshall [...] "shows terrific flair with all the usual chases and sword fights, and he handles the 3D well", and welcomed Penélope Cruz's character, saying she [...] "brings her Oscar-winning vivacity" [...] and had [...] "lively sexual tension" [...] with Depp. Writing for The Globe and Mail, Rick Groen found the action scenes to range from [...] "merely competent to tritely cluttered", but he was pleased with the overall result, calling McShane a [...] "fresh villain" [...] whose [...] "stentorian tones are welcome anywhere". Variety's Andrew Barker considered the film derivative, but accessible. [...] "It has nary an original idea and still doesn't make much sense, but it's lost all pretensions that it should". He praised Geoffrey Rush, stating that he [...] "not only gets the funniest lines and reaction shots, but also starts to siphon away much of the roguish charm that used to be Depp's stock and trade." ...|$|E

2500|$|Looking at {{the leading}} group, it was {{reasonable}} {{to think that}} Ballan, Le Mével or Popovych was going to attack sooner or later, as Freire is a top-class sprinter and would probably beat them all if {{they went to the}} finish line together. Yaroslav Popovych was the first to attack and immediately the French got disappointed as Christophe Le Mével dropped and never managed to come back. Alessandro Ballan however closed the gap and brought Óscar Freire back in his wheel. It was then Freire's turn to attack, but again Ballan closed the gap and now brought back Popovych. Popovych and Freire both took turns in attacking but Ballan seemed to be the strongest as he closed the gap every time. However, after a while he was also <b>getting</b> <b>tired</b> and could not respond to yet another attack by Popovych. He did not get any help from Freire in closing the gap and so Popovych won the stage. Freire knew he did not deserve the second place and left it to Ballan; however, this could cost him the green jersey in the end. Le Mével finished as fourth and in the peloton it was Tom Boonen who convincingly won the sprint for the fifth place, 4'25" [...] behind Popovych.|$|E
2500|$|The {{possible}} tactics {{prior to}} the race provided an ongoing discussion among racing fans, as both Nichols Canyon and Faugheen in their careers were keen {{to get in the}} lead but Ruby Walsh later explained: [...] "I viewed it that if Willie Mullins wasn't training Arctic Fire or Nichols Canyon, what would I do? That's the way I rode the race". Faugheen went in front approaching the first hurdle but Nichols Canyon came alongside him and forced a strong pace right from the start and the two were closely followed by Arctic Fire. At the third-last hurdle the fight for the lead upfront was beginning to take the toll on the two outsiders who were starting to be left behind. After two more furlongs Nichols Canyon showed the first signs of <b>getting</b> <b>tired</b> following Faugheen's strong gallop and jumped the second last hurdle markedly to his right with jockey Paul Townend pushing along whilst Arctic Fire passed him. Faugheen moved on by four lengths and extended to ten at the last hurdle, at which he showed his characteristic disregard for the small obstacles making a blunder out of it, landing awkwardly but without losing his momentum and being eased off by Ruby Walsh in the last 100 yards, still finishing 15 lengths clear of the runner-up Arctic Fire with a further 13 lengths back to Nichols Canyon.|$|E

2500|$|Eric Henderson from Slant Magazine {{said that}} the saddest thing about 20 Y.O. was Jackson's {{decision}} to make a terrible R instead of great dance music, which would likely pay off. He also referred to Jam and Lewis's production as [...] "ice-cold beats [...] have melted into a lugubrious, lukewarm pudding—at under an hour, it still feels almost {{twice as long as}} Janet. and The Velvet Rope." [...] With a C+ rating, Thomas Inskeep from Stylus Magazine called it [...] "half-decent" [...] and went to say, [...] "there's precious little to get, well, excited about here. Janet commits the ultimate sin of making an album that’s thoroughly mediocre. Apart from the sticky ear-candy of [...] "So Excited," [...] there’s little I’d miss here if I went six months without it. This doesn’t sound like rejuvenation—it sounds like the beginning of the end." [...] The Village Voices music critic Miles Marshall Lewis commented that Jackson's last two albums also talked excessively about sex, and with the new release, it was <b>getting</b> <b>tired.</b> Evan Serpick from Rolling Stone disagreed with the album's reference to Control, saying [...] "If we were her, we wouldn't make the comparison." [...] Angus Batey, writing for Yahoo! Music UK, remarked that in Jackson's producers desire to take Jackson back to her roots, they made not a great album for Jackson, but a facsimile of one; correct in all the details, but lacking substance and soul. Robert Christgau gave it a [...] "dud" [...] score (...) [...] Additionally, 20 Y.O. earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Contemporary R Album in 2007.|$|E
