40|$|Dermatomyositis (DM) is an {{idiopathic}} inflammatory process {{characterized by}} proximal muscle weakness and <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lesions,</b> {{such as the}} Gottron's sign, heliotrope rash, and erythematous photosensitive rash.

40|$|Abstract: Chronic <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lesions</b> affect 15 % of {{diabetic}} human {{patients and}} represent a risk 15 to 46 times larger of limb amputations compared {{to people with}} normal glycemia. It is assumed that half of these amputations could be prevented by early treatment of wounds, for example, with proper cell therapy. Objectives: In this study, {{the action of the}} autologous transplant of mesenchymal stem-cells (MSC) was evaluated compared to the treatment with autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) in the cicatrization of <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lesions</b> induced in diabetic mice. These animals were previously treated with streptozootocin to induce diabetes mellitus and round wounds of 1. 5 cm in diameter were created in the posterior region. Diameters of the wounds and healing time were evaluated during 30 days and the results were submitted to variance analysis and Tukey's test average. It was noticed that the animals treated with MSC presented a more accelerated cicatrization of the <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lesion</b> than the animals treated with PRP. However, the treatment with PRP presented better results than just the daily asepsis of the lesions with saline or covering them with semi-permeable bandage. Besides, the use of semi-permeable bandage kept the <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lesions</b> of diabetic mice did not interfere negatively with cicatrization, proved to be harmless to use, but kept the <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lesions</b> more hydrated than the ones exposed to the environment...|$|R

American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) caused by Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis is characterized by chronicity, latency and metastatic tendencies. In some cases, after the appearance of an initial <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lesion,</b> multiple <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lesions</b> (disseminated leishmaniasis, DL) and/or mucosal lesions (mucosal leishmaniasis, ML) can arise as a consequence of the dissemination of the parasite through the blood and lymphatic systems [1 - 3]. <b>Cutaneous</b> <b>lesions</b> can remain active for many years and can coexist with mucosal lesions, as exhibited in the mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL) form [4]. Less than 5 % of cutaneous leishmaniasis cases develop destructive lesions in the upper respiratory tract, primarily in the nasal mucosa [5], and more than 25 % of the DL cases present damaged mucosa simultaneously with cutaneous manifestations [6]. However, approximately 16 % of th...|$|R

40|$|Background: Non-pigmented 'pink' <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lesions</b> in {{differential}} diagnosis with {{basal cell carcinoma}} may present a challenge for clinicians. Our objective {{was to determine the}} potential improvement of diagnostic accuracy using combined dermoscopy-reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) image evaluation. Methods: Two hundred and sixty clinically equivocal 'pink' <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lesions</b> were evaluated retrospectively. Reader accuracy was tested with dermoscopy images only vs. RCM and combined dermoscopy-RCM images. Results: Out of 260 equivocal 'pink' <b>cutaneous</b> <b>lesions,</b> there were 114 basal cell carcinomas within a total of 140 malignancies that included 12 melanomas, 13 squamous cell carcinomas, and 1 other malignancy type. Dermoscopy only evaluation resulted in an overall sensitivity of 85. 1 % and specificity of 92. 4 %, resulting in a positive predictive value (PPV) of 89. 8 %, with 1 of 12 melanomas misdiagnosed. RCM evaluation resulted in an overall sensitivity of 85. 1 % and specificity of 93. 8 %, resulting in a PPV of 91. 5 %, with no melanomas misdiagnosed. Combined dermoscopy-RCM evaluation resulted in an overall sensitivity of 77. 2 % and specificity of 96. 6 %, resulting in a PPV of 94. 6 %.
