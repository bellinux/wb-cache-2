25|$|The Calvinist atonement {{is called}} {{definite}} by some {{because they believe}} it certainly secures the salvation of those for whom Christ died, and it is called {{limited in its extent}} because it effects salvation for the elect only. Calvinists <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> power of the atonement is limited in any way, {{which is to say that}} no sin is too great to be expiated by Christ's sacrifice, in their view. Among English Calvinistic (Particular) Baptists, the doctrine was usually known as particular redemption, giving its adherents the name Particular Baptists. This term emphasizes the intention of God to save particular persons through the atonement, as opposed to mankind in general as General Baptists believe.|$|E
25|$|According to Paul L Maier, {{most modern}} biographies of Herod <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> {{massacre}} took place. Steve Mason argues {{that if the}} massacre had taken place as described in Matthew, {{it would have been}} strange for Josephus not to mention it, and that the massacre may hence be non-historical. E. P. Sanders characterizes Josephus' writing as dwelling on Herod's cruelty, thus suggesting that Josephus would probably have included the event if it had occurred. Sanders states that faced with little historical information, Matthew's account is apparently based on the story in which an infant Moses is endangered by the Pharaoh in order to kill infant Hebrews and that such use of scripture for telling the story of Jesus' birth was considered legitimate by contemporary standards.|$|E
25|$|Major {{excavations}} {{beginning with}} C. A. Ralegh Radford's {{work in the}} 1930s on and around {{the site of the}} 12th-century castle have revealed that Tintagel headland was the site of a high status Celtic monastery (according to Ralegh Radford) or a princely fortress and trading settlement dating to the 5th and 6th centuries (according to later excavators), in the period immediately following the withdrawal of the Romans from Britain. Finds of Mediterranean oil and wine jars show that Sub-Roman Britain was not the isolated outpost it was previously considered to be, for an extensive trade in high-value goods was taking place at the time with the Mediterranean region. Finds from the excavations are preserved at the Royal Cornwall Museum in Truro. In 1998, excavations discovered the Artognou stone, which has added to Tintagel's Arthurian lore, although historians <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> inscription refers to King Arthur. Two seasons of excavation work were undertaken in Tintagel churchyard in the early 1990s.|$|E

25|$|P46 is {{the second}} New Testament {{manuscript}} in the Chester Beatty collection (P. II), and was a codex that contained the Pauline Epistles dating c. 200. What remains today of the manuscript is roughly 85 out of 104 leaves consisting of Romans chapters 5-6, 8-15, all of Hebrews, Ephesians, Galatians, Philippians, Colossians, virtually all of 1–2 Corinthians and 1 Thessalonians 1-2, 5. The leaves have partially deteriorated, resulting {{in the loss of}} some lines at the bottom of each folio. The manuscript split up between the Chester Beatty Library and the University of Michigan. Scholars <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> Pastoral epistles were included originally in the codex, based on the amount of space required in the missing leaves; they conclude 2 Thessalonians would have occupied the final portion of the codex. The inclusion of Hebrews, a book that was questioned canonically and not considered authored by Paul, is notable. The placement of it following Romans is unique against most other witnesses, as is the ordering of Galatians following Ephesians.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the program}} {{received}} widespread support in Congress, Treasury officials opposed it. In a letter, Treasury secretary W.Michael Blumenthal wrote, [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Government should permit the erroneous impression {{to be created}} that it cannot or will not take the necessary steps to combat inflation and that the public therefore needs to buy gold as a hedge against inflation." [...] Blumenthal also believed that if the government were to sanction the striking of gold medallions, the public would believe that the Treasury was actively encouraging investment in gold. Despite these objections, the bill {{was attached to the}} bank omnibus bill, which President Jimmy Carter signed into law on November 10, 1978.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} [...] non-native, {{invasive}} {{species have been}} identified as a threat to native biodiversity, including Giant Hogweed, Japanese Knotweed and Rhododendron. In May 2008 it was announced that psyllid lice from Japan, which feed on the Knotweed, may be introduced to the UK to bring the plant under control. This would be the first time that an alien species has been used in Britain in this way. Scientists at the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux International <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> lice will cause any environmental damage. Over-grazing caused by the large numbers of Red Deer and sheep has also resulted in the impoverishment of moorland and upland habitats and a loss of native woodland.|$|E
500|$|The Kennel Club {{initially}} had a {{class for}} [...] "Water spaniels other than Irish" [...] as no standard was specifically {{set up for}} the English Water Spaniel and the judging of this class was described as [...] "chaos" [...] by Hugh Dalziel in British Dogs: Their Varieties, History, Characteristics, Breeding, Management, And Exhibition. Writing in 1897, Dalziel said of the breed, [...] "I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> breed is lost, but that scattered throughout the country there are many specimens of the old English water spaniel, which it only requires that amount of encouragement to breeding which it is in the power of show committees to give to perpetuate the variety and improve its form." [...] Dalziel bemoaned the fact that while the Irish Water Spaniel continued, the English Water Spaniel was allowed to quietly be absorbed into other Spaniel breeds.|$|E
500|$|In America, the {{political}} atmosphere {{began to change}} and attention was once again directed to Chaplin's films instead of his views. In July 1962, The New York Times published an editorial stating that [...] "we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> Republic would be in danger if yesterday's unforgotten little tramp were allowed to amble down the gangplank of a steamer or plane in an American port". The same month, Chaplin was invested with the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters by the universities of Oxford and Durham. In November 1963, the Plaza Theater in New York started a year-long series of Chaplin's films, including Monsieur Verdoux and Limelight, which gained excellent reviews from American critics. September 1964 saw the release of Chaplin's memoirs, My Autobiography, {{which he had been}} working on since 1957. The 500-page book, which focused on his early years and personal life, became a worldwide best-seller, despite criticism over the lack of information on his film career.|$|E

500|$|Keenor's {{abilities}} {{were described}} as scant. A 'terrible' shot and unable to reliably run with the ball, his strength lay in {{his commitment to the}} cause and in his uncompromising tackling. Fred Stewart, who coached Keenor for over 15 years at Cardiff City stated [...] "I honestly <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> word [...] "beaten" [...] is in his vocabulary." [...] Former team mate, Ernie Curtis said of him: [...] "He was one of the hardest tacklers in the game, some said he was dirty but he was just hard. Nobody took liberties with old Fred... could run all night, he couldn't run with the ball mind you, but he could run all day." [...] Charlie Buchan, captain of the opposing Arsenal side in the 1927 FA Cup final, described Keenor as having [...] "a store of energy (that) seemed inexhaustible in defending his goal". His hard tackling style made him a target for opposition fans, even being assaulted after a match for Crewe Alexandra during the later years of his career after a physical performance against an opposition side angered some of their fans.|$|E
500|$|The fourth error, {{according}} to Peter the Venerable, {{was that the}} Petrobrusians denied sacramental grace, [...] rejecting the rite of Communion entirely, let alone {{the doctrine of the}} real presence or the nascent Scholastic account of transubstantiation. “They deny, not only the truth of the body and blood of the Lord, daily and constantly offered in the church through the sacrament, but declare that it is nothing at all, and ought not to be offered to God. They say, 'Oh, people, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>believe</b> <b>the</b> bishops, priests, or clergy who seduce you; who, as in many things, so {{in the office of the}} altar, deceive you when they falsely profess to make the body of Christ, and give it to you for the salvation of your souls.'" [...] The term [...] "transubstantiation", used to describe the transformation of the consecrated bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ, was first used by Hildebert de Lavardin in about 1079. This theory had long been widely accepted as orthodox doctrine at the time of the attacks by Peter of Bruys. In less than two centuries, in 1215, the Fourth Lateran Council officially declared transubstantiation the necessary, orthodox Catholic explanation of the Eucharist.|$|E
