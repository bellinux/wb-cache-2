5|$|In 1976, {{his body}} was {{discovered}} next to a rifle, near a fence on the property; he had tripped as <b>he</b> <b>climbed</b> through the fence, and he accidentally shot himself. O'Halloran never married. The 50m pool at Kojonup was named the Kevin O'Halloran Memorial Pool in his honour, and he was posthumously inducted into the Western Australian Hall of Champions.|$|E
5|$|He {{was born}} into a lower-class family in Quảng Trị Province, in the {{southern}} part of French Indochina as Lê Văn Nhuận. Little is known about his family and childhood. He first came in contact with revolutionary thoughts in the 1920s through his work as a railway clerk. Lê Duẩn was a founding member of the Indochina Communist Party (the future Communist Party of Vietnam) in 1930. He was imprisoned in 1931 and released in 1937. From 1937 to 1939 <b>he</b> <b>climbed</b> the party ladder. He was rearrested in 1939, this time for fomenting an uprising in the South. Lê Duẩn was released from jail following the successful Communist-led August Revolution.|$|E

5|$|Milan Pořádek, the fan whom Blythe {{admitted}} to shoving off the stage, testified {{on the third}} day of the trial. Pořádek said <b>he</b> <b>climbed</b> the stage twice in order to stage dive; he changed his mind during the third attempt to get on stage. Pořádek testified that Blythe knocked him down, knelt on him and held him down for a moment, but Blythe definitely did not choke him. He also admitted that taking into account the fact that he (Pořádek) was drunk and the way he acted, Blythe's reaction was adequate. He commented that he grasped {{the fact that he was}} not wanted on stage.|$|E
5|$|Helmut Wick, {{accompanied}} by his Stabsschwarm—including Oberleutnant Rudolf Pflanz, Leutnant Franz Fiby and Oberleutnant Erich Leie — claimed his 55th aerial victory when he shot down a Spitfire {{on the afternoon of}} 28 November 1940. His opponent could have been No. 602 Squadron's Pilot Officer Archibald Lyall, who was reported killed in the engagement. This made Wick the highest-scoring fighter pilot in the Luftwaffe, surpassing Mölders, whose score at the time stood at 54 victories. Returning from this mission to Cherbourg- Querqueville, Wick ordered the aircraft refueled and re-armed. Together with Erich Leie as his wingman, Wick took off at 4:10p.m. and returned to the vicinity of the Isle of Wight. Spotting a flight of Spitfires <b>he</b> <b>climbed</b> to intercept from a more favourable attack position. In a diving attack Wick shot down and killed Pilot Officer Paul A. Baillon, of No. 609 Squadron, flying Spitfire R6631.|$|E
5|$|Several {{days before}} President Kennedy made his November flight to Texas, Grant had been {{assigned}} to cover the state's delegation in Washington, D.C., then fly back with the White House press corps; he was the only photographer to make the trip. At Dallas Love Field, Grant made the only published photograph from that visit of the president and Jacqueline Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson, and Texas Governor John Connally and Nellie Connally, all in the same image. Another of Grant's photos, from San Antonio's Aerospace Medicine Center, was published {{on the front page of}} the Dallas Morning News on November 22; a copy was signed that morning by President Kennedy—across the photo, to Jan White—and is believed to be the last item he signed before <b>he</b> <b>climbed</b> aboard the presidential limousine for his intended trip to the Dallas Trade Mart.|$|E
5000|$|When Henri Beraldi {{received}} The Pyrenees Prize {{from the}} Society of Geographers in Paris, he gave of [...] "pyreneist" [...] (someone who practices pyreneism) the following definition : The pyreneist's ideal {{is to know}} how to climb, write and feel, all wrapped-up in one. If <b>he</b> writes without <b>climbing,</b> <b>he</b> can do nothing. If <b>he</b> <b>climbs</b> without writing, <b>he</b> leaves nothing. If, <b>climbing,</b> <b>he</b> drily relates it, he leaves but a mere document, that can indeed be of high interest.

5|$|The local {{population}} remained faithful to Skanderbeg {{and did not}} reveal his whereabouts. Isak bey and Hamza grew confident that Skanderbeg had been defeated and had thus began to withdraw. When he judged the time right, Skanderbeg gave the signal for the army, which had up until then been in separate groups, to assemble without being seen by the Ottomans. The army gathered by the hills at Tumenishta – as the weakest point in the Ottoman camp was in this direction – and on 2 September 1457, it was split again into three groups to assault the Ottoman camp. With {{some of his most}} trusted men, <b>he</b> <b>climbed</b> to a high peak to scout on the Ottoman camp and saw that the Ottomans were resting. He descended with his chosen band to eliminate any watching guards, but one saw Skanderbeg and fled into the camp yelling that Skanderbeg had arrived. In order to maintain the surprise, Skanderbeg ordered his men to get ready for battle.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was the Hell in a Cell match between Shawn Michaels and Triple H. The match began with Michaels {{delivering}} a Thesz Press and slamming Triple H {{into the cell}} wall, resulting in Triple H bleeding. Triple H got the advantage, as {{he was able to}} counter a piledriver and performed a back body drop on Michaels. Another attack saw Triple H hit Michaels with the steel steps, which resulted in Michaels bleeding. A spot in the match saw Michaels lay Triple H on a table, as <b>he</b> <b>climbed</b> onto a ladder that he took out from under the ring, and performed a diving elbow drop onto Triple H through the table. Afterwards, Triple H gained the advantage and performed a Pedigree on Michaels for the win. After the match, Michaels was given a standing ovation by the audience.|$|E
5|$|Chief Gunner's Mate Michael B. Wallrath, who had {{assisted}} in lowering three lifeboats while he remained on board, jumped overboard after seeing {{to it that}} all the boats were away. Wallrath was pulled into lifeboat number 6 just before a wave capsized it and drowned two of its occupants. Lieutenant commander R. B. Vandervoort, USNRF, West Gates commanding officer, remained on board until he felt sure that the entire crew had departed the sinking ship. When <b>he</b> <b>climbed</b> up on the deckhouse to cut free a life raft and leave the ship, he discovered six men huddled on deck. Vandervoort {{was able to get}} the six on the life raft, but the suction caused by West Gates final plunge pulled him away and below the surface. After he managed {{to get back to the}} surface, he clung to floating wreckage for two hours until pulled aboard the very raft he had missed earlier. Vandervoort and the six men aboard the raft were rescued by one of Americans lifeboats at 06:00, after some 3½ hours in the water.|$|E

5|$|Jackie Chan was the stunt {{director}} of Rob-B-Hood, having choreographed all the stunts with the Jackie Chan Stunt Team. He continued his tradition of performing his own stunts in the film, for example, jumping between several air-conditioners {{on the outer}} wall of a tall building to reach the ground. Several scenes required Chan to co-ordinate his stunts with the baby, including a car chase around the Sha Tin industrial area, in which he managed to snatch the baby away seconds before a car crashed into him; and a scene in Ocean Park in which <b>he</b> <b>climbed</b> {{on the underside of}} a roller coaster with the baby in hand. Chan suffered minor injuries attempting stunts in the film, having been kicked in the chest by a stuntman wearing the wrong boots and fallen off a quad bike, while attempting to perform a wheelie. Chan's combat choreography included the use of improvised weapons in combat; when he fought a pair of skilled henchmen in a deep freeze room, he defeated them by spraying them with milk and then using a large fan to blast them with cold air.|$|E
5|$|Maitland showed Napoleon {{the great}} cabin, {{which he had}} placed at his disposal, {{and gave him a}} tour of his ship. At 10:30 a.m. the Superb {{anchored}} in the roadstead and Maitland went to make his report. Hotham approved of his arrangements, and agreed that Napoleon should be transported to England aboard the Bellerophon. He came aboard himself to meet the former Emperor, and a grand dinner was held in the great cabin, attended by Napoleon's retinue and British officers. The following day Napoleon visited Hotham on the Superb, and after his return, Maitland began the voyage to England in company with HMS Myrmidon. A routine was soon developed, with Napoleon usually taking a walk on deck around 5 p.m., followed by a formal dinner at 6 p.m. The sailors and officers removed their hats and kept their distance when Napoleon came on deck, only talking with him if he invited them to. The routine was broken slightly early in the morning of 23 July, when Napoleon appeared at dawn, as Bellerophon came in sight of Ushant, the last piece of French land visible {{for the remainder of the}} journey. <b>He</b> <b>climbed</b> up to the poop deck, attended by a midshipman, and spent the morning watching the coastline slowly recede from view. He was joined by members of his retinue, though he did not speak to any of them.|$|E
5|$|The final {{match of}} the evening was between Bret Hart and Bam Bam Bigelow to {{determine}} {{the winner of the}} tournament. Bigelow used his strength advantage to control the beginning of the match. He threw Hart out of the ring and focused on injuring Hart's back. Hart escaped from a bear hug and pushed Bigelow into the steel rail at ringside. Bigelow responded by pushing Hart's back into the ring post. Luna Vachon, Bigelow's valet, hit Hart with a chair, which enabled Bigelow to pin Hart and be declared the winner. Referee Earl Hebner came to the ring, however, and explained to Joey Marella, the referee for the match, what had happened. The match was ordered to continue, and Bigelow continued to attack Hart's back. While Bigelow was outside of the ring, Hart performed a flying crossbody by jumping over the top rope and landing on Bigelow. He attempted to perform the Sharpshooter but was unable. As Bigelow ran at Hart {{in the corner of the}} ring, Hart moved out of the way. <b>He</b> <b>climbed</b> onto Bigelow's shoulders and flipped Bigelow forward to pin him with a victory roll.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> has <b>climbed</b> {{to the top}} {{of several}} seven-thousanders (and in the case of some of them, like Communism Peak, he has {{successfully}} summited several times). <b>He</b> has technically <b>climbed</b> over 8,000 m; however, he has not successfully reached the summit of an eight-thousander.

5|$|The {{main event}} was a Biker Chain {{match for the}} WWE Championship between Brock Lesnar and The Undertaker. During the match, a chain was hung on a pole above the ring, and once it was {{retrieved}} {{it could be used}} as a legal weapon. After enduring a series of punches from Lesnar, Undertaker attempted to take the chain down, but the lights in the arena went out and <b>he</b> <b>climbed</b> back down to the ring. Taker then executed a piledriver on Lesnar onto the ring steps. Taker put Lesnar in a dragon sleeper. After getting out of the hold, Lesnar executed a F-5 to Taker. Lesnar made an attempt to go for the chain, but Taker performed a chokeslam off the top rope. Following this, The Full Blooded Italians interfered in the match, trying to attack Taker. Taker threw them out of the ring and did a suicide dive onto them after performing a Last Ride on Lesnar. He then retrieved the chain off the pole and wrapped it around it his fist, planning to strike Lesnar with it. Vince McMahon interfered and pushed Taker off the top rope. Lesnar then punched Taker with the chain to retain the title.|$|E
5|$|Daphnomeles {{participated in}} the {{subsequent}} conflicts against Tsar Samuel, but his greatest feat was the capture of the Bulgarian leader Ibatzes in 1018, {{for which he is}} given a prominent position in Skylitzes's work. Following the defeat at the Battle of Kleidion in 1015, Bulgarian resistance began to collapse. By 1018, most Bulgarian commanders had surrendered, and only Ibatzes, who had retreated with his followers to the royal estate of Pronista, a naturally strong and defensible highland position, continued to resist. He rejected both bribes and threats from the Byzantines, and for 55 days, the Byzantine army under Emperor Basil II remained encamped at Deabolis nearby, waiting for his surrender. At that point, and as local crowds gathered to Ibatzes's palace for the feast of the Dormition, Daphnomeles, now strategos of nearby Achrida, on his own initiative, resolved to end the impasse. With only two escorts, <b>he</b> <b>climbed</b> the way to the estate, and announced himself to Ibatzes. Ibatzes, believing that Daphnomeles would not have come alone unless he intended to forge an alliance against Basil, retreated with the strategos to a secluded wooded glade in the gardens for a private discussion. There, Daphnomeles and his two hidden associates sprang on the Bulgarian general, blinded him, and carried him to the upper story of the palace, through the assembled crowds who were too stunned to react. When the Bulgarians recovered, they gathered underneath the building crying for revenge. Daphnomeles, however, addressed them and managed to convince them of the futility of further resistance, and to lay down their arms and seek the emperor's pardon.|$|E
5|$|There was {{evidence}} that Braham's judgement was becoming impaired. He had not taken much leave {{since the war began}} in 1939 and he admitted to becoming short-tempered with his family and those around him. He had spent much of the previous two years leading from the front and flying long and hazardous operations over enemy territory. On 7 May 1944 he collected navigator Flight Lieutenant Donald Walsh from Group headquarters. He borrowed a Mosquito from 21 Squadron at Gravesend. He flew to Norfolk to refuel and spent time with his old unit, 141 Squadron, and spent the night at West Raynham. Over Roskilde, Denmark, he caught a Ju 88 after a 10-minute chase and shot it down—his 28th victory. On 12 May Braham repeated the operation. This time he took Bill Gregory with him. Operating over the Aalborg–Copenhagen line he spotted a Fw 190 near Hurning. Giving chase Braham found himself under attack by a Bf 109—his presence clearly detected by German radar. His Mosquito was hit in the port wing and the fuel line were ruptured. The Bf 109 then disappeared. Ignoring the damage he closed on the Fw 190. At zero feet his Mosquito bounced off a mound but he managed to hit the enemy aircraft which burst into flames, stalled and crashed near Aalborg. The range was so close—around 100 yards—the Focke-Wulf nearly collided with Braham. The loss of fuel from the chase and damage coupled with his damaged propellers upon his collision with the ground, meant that the chances of reaching England were slim. <b>He</b> <b>climbed</b> to high altitude 70 miles from the coast and broadcast an emergency message which was received. He ditched the Mosquito which broke in half. They took the dingy and watched the tail and wings remain afloat. He was retrieved with Gregory by air-sea rescue. Royal Navy trawlers sank the sections of aircraft remaining afloat. Regardless of the venture, on 13 June 1944 he received his final award—a second bar to his DSO.|$|E
