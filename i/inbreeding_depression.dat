Therefore, a literature study and 10 interviews with dairy cattle breeding experts were conducted to get a better knowledge on inbreeding impacts in small populations. Results: <b>Inbreeding</b> <b>depressions</b> were described for production, sperm quality and quantity, reproduction, calf vitality, longevity and calving traits and on hereditary diseases. Experts argued that cattle is quite resistant against <b>inbreeding</b> <b>depressions.</b> Their occurrence depends on the degree of inbreeding and on the effective population size, but even more on breeders’ knowledge about their animals’ features in past generations.

40|$|Eucalyptus is {{the most}} widely planted species in Madagascar. Eucalyptus robusta {{is the most}} common species (225 000 ha) because it is well adapted and has {{multipurpose}} wood uses (energy, pole, and timber). Although this species has been naturalized for more than a century, {{little is known about the}} introduced genetic diversity. Previous research leads us to assume that it has a narrow genetic base. A study of genetic variability and genotype by environment interaction for E. robusta growth was therefore conducted. This study concerns two provenance trials (24 provenances from Australia, 1 from Madagascar) and three progeny trials established in two bioclimatic regions, regularly monitored for > 10 years. In both sites, results showed strong provenance effects and genotype by environment interactions for growth. However, the Malagasy provenance was the poorer performer for growth, compared to the Australian. This could be attributed to its origin, mainly to <b>inbreeding</b> <b>depressions</b> due to the narrow genetic base introduced. Due to climate change, this low diversity, which will be confi rmed by ongoing molecular genetic studies, may represent biological and economical risks.

40|$|Reproduction Performance {{and degree}} of {{inbreeding}} in a small Finnsheep population during a 34 -year period Summary The Finnish Landrace sheep breed {{is famous for its}} high prolificacy. Their potential in fattening and carcass Performance, however, is rather low if the economical importance of these traits is considered. Therefore cotnmercial crosses with mutton breeds should be established to combine both characteristics. Thus, it was necessary to keep a small pure bred population Finnsheep as a gene reservoir. The long term maintenance of a small population without any outcross must necessarily lead to a certain amount of inbreeding. As a consequence in most species <b>inbreeding</b> <b>depressions</b> occur, in particularly in fertility traits. In the present study therefore it is investigated how this relation developed during 1966 up to 2000 in our flock. To establish a small flock in 1965 four rams and 15 pregnant ewes were imported from Finland directly. All of them had lambed several times already, thus their fertility abilities were well known. To avoid close relationships between the animals they were purchased from several farms. Three rams and 13 ewes formed the basis for the flock in the Institute for Animal Science and Animal Behaviour and is kept until today. By individual matings, inbreeding was avoided as far as possible. For outbreeding in 1972 and 1973 one ram each was purchased from Gießen and Hohenheim respectively and in 1981 two rams were imported from Finland directly. The prolificacy data may occasionally be influenced by interfering experiments. In principle only one lambing season per year was allowed. Under these conditions the following results were achieved during the time perio...|$|R
40|$|The {{abundance}} of pollinators in alpine areas are scarce due to harsh and unstable weather conditions. This scarcity {{can lead to}} pollen limitation in unisexual plants and drive evolution towards self-compatible plants. Unisexual plants may have an advantage in favourable years if self-pollinating plants experience <b>inbreeding</b> <b>depressions.</b> Different dependence on pollinator visitation for different sexual morphs of a species can lead to sexual dimorphism in pollinator attracting traits, such as flower size. I did field studies and statistical analyses to investigate the predictions: I) Hermaphrodites will have larger flowers than females, II) visitation frequency will be higher on plants with large flowers and higher flower density, III) female flowers will have higher fruit production, and IV) pollen limitation is stronger in females than in hermaphrodites. The field studies were done at Finse on Hardangervidda in Norway with three populations of Silene acaulis along an environmental gradient from 1300 to 1450 m. a. s. l. during June to August 2014. To study effects of plant and flower size, {{abundance of}} plants and sex on flower visitations and fruit production, 20 pairs consisting of one female and one hermaphrodite plant were observed. To quantify pollen limitation I preformed a supplemental pollination experiment on 5 - 6 pairs {{in each of the}} three populations. Hermaphrodites had 25. 9 % larger flowers than females, and a higher pollinator visitation frequency. Visitation frequency was also higher in populations with high plant abundance and increased with flower size. Females had 4. 2 times higher fruit set than hermaphrodites. Results from the supplemental pollination experiment show that hermaphrodites have a stronger pollen limitation, and increased significantly their mean seed production by 124 % after supplemental pollination, while females did not significantly increase their seed production after supplemental pollination. These results show that there is a sexual dimorphism in Silene acaulis at Finse. I suggest that the difference in flower size and fruit set is because hermaphrodites are functionally males in this population, and have a higher reproductive output, by pollen dispersal, from increased pollinator visitation, and therefore have larger flowers than females. This gynodioecious population may be evolving towards dioecy, but it is also possible that seed production is higher in hermaphrodites, relative to females, in less favourable seasons than the summer of 2014.

5|$|An {{interesting}} {{example of}} a bottleneck causing unusual genetic distribution is the relatively high proportion of individuals with total rod cell color blindness (achromatopsia) on Pingelap atoll in Micronesia. After a bottleneck, inbreeding increases.

In addition, a sustained reduction in population size increases the likelihood of further allele fluctuations from drift in generations to come.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the most}} {{widespread}} of Asian rhinoceroses, the Javan rhinoceros ranged from the islands of Java and Sumatra, throughout Southeast Asia, and into India and China. The species is critically endangered, with only one known population in the wild, and no individuals in captivity. It is possibly the rarest large mammal on Earth, {{with a population of}} as few as 58 to 61 in Ujung Kulon National Park at the western tip of Java in Indonesia. A second population in Cat Tien National Park in Vietnam was confirmed as extinct in 2011. The decline of the Javan rhinoceros is attributed to poaching, primarily for their horns, which are highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine, fetching as much as US$30,000 per kg on the black market. As European presence in their range increased, trophy hunting also became a serious threat. Loss of habitat, especially as the result of wars, such as the Vietnam War, in Southeast Asia, has also contributed to the species' decline and hindered recovery. The remaining range is within one nationally protected area, but the rhinos are still at risk from poachers, disease, and loss of genetic diversity leading to <b>inbreeding</b> <b>depression.</b>|$|E

These results were matched with hatching rates and infection success of inbred and 34 outcrossed trematodes in both intermediate hosts.

40|$|When {{collecting}} seed for wetland restoration projects, it {{is important}} to understand the genetic diversity within and among source populations to balance the risks of <b>inbreeding</b> and outbreeding <b>depression</b> while maintaining genetic diversity to maximize adaptive potential. To inform future restoration projects, we investigated the patterns and structure of genetic diversity of Schoenoplectus maritimus L. Lye. stands within six wetlands in Utah and Idaho, U. S. A. S. maritimus, a perennial wetland plant, reproduces via seed and clonal spread and is an obligate outcrosser. Our results indicate the presence of five weakly differentiated populations and one distinct population (Fish Springs). We found high levels of genetic diversity with the majority (92 %) of diversity found within rather than among sites (8 %). We also found that the proportion of viable seed produced was surprisingly high within stands (mean= 0. 64 +- 0. 02) given that S. maritimus is a clonally spreading plant. Taken together, these findings indicate that 1) all populations sampled were genetically distinct, and 2) that the high levels of genetic diversity, and therefore increased availability of outcross pollen, may contribute to the high proportion of viable seeds produced. We suggest that each population be treated as an independent management unit to preserve population structure and that seeds be collected broadly within one or a few populations in close geographic proximity to a proposed restoration site to minimize the risk of <b>inbreeding</b> or outbreeding <b>depression</b> and increase the adaptive potential of restored plant populations. We studied the pattern and structure of genetic diversity of alkali bulrush. Each stand (n= 6) represented a unique population. Genetic diversity was high within stands.

40|$|Background and Aims: Plants show {{patterns}} of spatial genetic differentiation reflecting gene flow mediated by pollen and seed dispersal and genotype × environment interactions. If {{patterns of}} genetic structure are determined largely by gene flow then {{they may be}} useful in predicting the likelihood of <b>inbreeding</b> or outbreeding <b>depression</b> but should be less useful if there is strong site-specific selection. For many Australian plants little is known about either their population genetics or the effects on mating systems of variation in pollen transfer distances. Experimental pollinations were used to compare the reproductive success of bird-adapted Grevillea mucronulata plants mated with individuals from a range of spatial scales. A hierarchical survey of microsatellite DNA variation was also conducted to describe the scale of population differentiation for neutral markers. • Methods: The effects of four pollen treatments on reproductive performance were compared. These treatments were characterized by transfer of pollen from (a) neighbouring adults; (b) an adjacent cluster of adults (30 - 50 m distant); (c) a distant cluster (3 ̆e 5 km distant); and (d) open pollination. Sets of 17. 9 ± 3 · 3 leaves from each of 15 clusters of plants were genotyped and spatial autocorrelation and F statistics were used to describe patterns of genetic structure. • Key Results: Grevillea mucronulata displayed evidence of both <b>inbreeding</b> and outbreeding <b>depression,</b> with 2 ̆ 7 intermediate 2 ̆ 7 pollen producing consistently superior outcomes for most aspects of fitness including seed set, seed size, germination and seedling growth. Significant genotypic structuring was detected within clusters (spatial autocorrelation) and among adjacent clusters and clusters separated by 3 ̆e 5 km distance (FST = 0. 07 and 0 · 10). • Conclusions: The superior outcome of intermediate pollen transfer and genetic differentiation of adjacent clusters suggests that G. mucronulata selection disfavours matings among closely and distantly related neighbours. Moreover, the performance of open-pollinated seedlings was poor, implying that current mating patterns are suboptimal. © The Author 2011.

We conducted an experiment under laboratory conditions over two generations (G 1 and G 2) using snails sampled from two populations (100 individuals per population). G 1 individuals were either isolated or paired once a week (potentially allowing for crosses), and monitored during 29 weeks for growth, fecundity and survival. Very few copulations were observed in paired snails, {{and there was a}} positive correlation in copulatory activity (e. g. number of copulations) between the male and female sexual roles. The waiting time was either null or negative, meaning that isolated individuals initiated reproduction before paired ones. G 2 offspring did not differ in hatching rate and survival (to 28 days) between treatments, but offspring from paired individuals grew faster than those from isolated individuals. On the whole, the self-fertilization depression was extremely low in both populations. Another important result is that paired G 1 individuals began laying (selfed) eggs several weeks prior to initiating copulation: this is the first characterization of prior selfing (selfing initiated prior to any outcrossing) in a hermaphroditic animal.

After dramatic declines {{it is the}} target of many restoration initiatives. To increase knowledge of the capacity of remaining populations to either adapt through natural selection or acclimate to emerging environmental conditions, I combined genetic data and common environment experiments to quantify V. americana genetic diversity and differentiation at local to regional scales, evaluate evidence of local adaptation to different climate conditions, and assess evidence of <b>inbreeding</b> or outbreeding <b>depression.</b> 	I quantified the structure of genetic diversity in five sites from the tidal Potomac, Hudson, and Kennebec Rivers, and 33 sites across the species' distribution in the Potomac. Genotypic (0. 1 - 1. 0) and allelic diversity (1. 5 - 5. 5), observed heterozygosity (0. 34 - 0. 72), and relatedness (- 0. 06 - 1. 00) varied greatly along rivers and across latitude. Hudson V. americana had the lowest genetic diversity and Potomac had the highest. Differentiation and network analysis of relatedness revealed no common genetic diversity distribution patterns within rivers. Major differences in genetic structure were observed across the tidal and non-tidal Potomac. 	Common environment experiments evaluating growth and reproductive performance of Potomac, Hudson, and Kennebec V. americana grown in different temperature and photoperiod conditions only found evidence of local adaption in Potomac plants. Few overall differences in morphological and life history traits were observed between local and foreign plants. Plants grown under global warming conditions had reduced performance. Limited evidence of local adaptation and high acclimation to different conditions suggest that populations have high potential for resilience {{in the face of}} climate change, so long as temperatures do not exceed thermal tolerances. Climate change mitigation strategies that involve transplanting individuals may also be successful. 	To investigate consequences of restoration strategies that translocate individuals, I evaluated seed production and germination success of controlled reproductive crosses between V. americana within and among genetically differentiated populations in the Chesapeake Bay. There were no consistent patterns of <b>inbreeding</b> or outbreeding <b>depression</b> in crosses.

40|$|In {{a closed}} population, mating of related {{individuals}} (inbreeding) occurs because {{of only a}} few number of ancestors. Related individuals have an increased proportion of their genome in common. The probability for the offspring increases to inherit the same allele of one common ancestor from each of the parents and to be homozygous for the locus. The closer the relationship of the parents the faster the proportion of homozygous loci rises in the progeny. Based on these relations, the inbreeding coefficient F (Wright 1921) reflects the increase of homozygosity in a population or the expected proportion of allele pairs identical by descent for an individual, respectively. Beside this estimation method, individual homozygosity can be measured directly with different genetic markers in chickens, for example with RFLP, with protein polymorphism or with microsatellite markers. The objective of the presented study was to analyse genetic variability in a closed New Hampshire line by comparison of estimated (by inbreeding coefficients) and realized (by microsatellite analysis) inbreeding. The New Hampshire line was maintained at the research station of the institute of Animal Sciences, Humboldt-University of Berlin near Berlin/Germany since 1955. Divided into 15 sublines, the hens (10 to 15 per subline) were mated in a rotation system once a year in order to avoid close inbreeding. The individual inbreeding coefficients F (Wright) were estimated including complete pedigree data of about 8100 chickens. For the molecular analysis, DNA was isolated from blood samples of generation 1994 (79 chickens) and plasma samples of generation 1982 (58 chickens). The individuals were typed by 17 markers located in non-coding regions and 6 markers within coding regions. Based on the frequencies of genotypes, allele frequencies and expected genotype frequencies were calculated and their deviations from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) were checked. The individual realized inbreeding was determined as the proportion of homozygous loci of all investigated loci. In the investigated New Hampshire line 22 markers were polymorphic showing only few alleles per locus (2 to 4). Comparing the generations of 1982 and 1994, 80 % of the loci changed allele frequencies significantly, partly accompanied by losses of alleles in 1994. In 5 loci the observed genotype frequencies deviated significantly from HWE expectations in both generations, but in contrast to the theory mainly with tendency to heterozygosity. Mean realized inbreeding increased from 56, 4 % (in 1982) to 61, 6 % (in 1994). At the same time the mean estimated inbreeding (Wright) increased from 18, 8 % to 24, 3 % and reached 26, 6 % after 43 generations. The low rate of inbreeding was caused by the rotation mating scheme which was used to avoid close inbreeding. The increase of realized inbreeding (molecular analysis) was higher than predicted by the increase of estimated inbreeding (Wright). In general, an overestimation of homozygosity by the inbreeding coefficient was expected because of heterozygote advantages. These advantages could be explained by heterozygous genes which are responsible for fertility and vitality. The microsatellites for the presented analysis were chosen from coding and non-coding regions. In contrast to the majority of 17 markers located in non-coding regions with increasing homozygosity, the 6 microsatellites located within coding regions showed on average an increase of heterozygosity in the New Hampshire line. Slow inbreeding and slight selection to maintain the line compensated <b>inbreeding</b> <b>depressions</b> and could have counteracted the expected decrease in heterozygosity...|$|R

25|$|For a time, the {{black-footed ferret}} was {{harvested}} for the fur trade, with the American Fur Company having received 86 ferret skins from Pratt, Chouteau, and Company of St. Louis {{in the late}} 1830s.

This likely continued after the passing of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, for fear of reprisals. The large drop in black-footed ferret numbers began during the 1800s through to the 1900s, as prairie dog numbers declined because of control programs and the conversion of prairies to croplands. Sylvatic plague, a disease caused by Yersinia pestis introduced into North America, also contributed to the prairie dog die-off, though ferret numbers declined proportionately more than their prey, thus indicating other factors may have been responsible. Plague was first detected in South Dakota in a coyote in 2004, and then in ~50,000 acres of prairie dogs on Pine Ridge Reservation in 2005. Thereafter 7,000 acres of prairie dog colonies were treated with insecticide (DeltaDust) and 1,000 acres of black-footed ferret habitat were prophylactically dusted in Conata Basin in 2006–2007. Nevertheless, plague was proven in ferrets in May 2008. Since then each year 12,000 acres of their Conata Basin habitat is dusted and about 50–150 ferrets are immunized with plague vaccine. <b>Inbreeding</b> <b>depression</b> may have also contributed, as studies on black-footed ferrets from Meeteetse, Wyoming revealed low levels of genetic variation.

40|$|Many {{reintroduction}} {{projects for}} conservation fail, {{and there are}} a large number of factors that may contribute to failure. Genetic analysis can be used to help stack the odds of a reintroduction in favour of success, by conducting assessment of source populations to evaluate the possibility of <b>inbreeding</b> and outbreeding <b>depression</b> and by conducting postrelease monitoring. In this study, we use a panel of 306 SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) markers and 487 - 489 base pairs of mitochondrial DNA control region sequence data to examine 321 individuals from possible source populations of the Eurasian beaver for a reintroduction to Scotland. We use this information to reassess the phylogenetic history of the Eurasian beavers, to examine the genetic legacy of past reintroductions on the Eurasian landmass and to assess the future power of the genetic markers to conduct ongoing monitoring via parentage analysis and individual identification. We demonstrate the capacity of medium density genetic data (hundreds of SNPs) to provide information suitable for applied conservation and discuss the difficulty of balancing the need for high genetic diversity against phylogenetic best fit when choosing source population(s) for reintroduction. © 2014 The Authors.

40|$|For {{restoration}} purposes, {{nature conservation}} generally enforces {{the use of}} local seed material based on the local-is-best (LIB) approach. However, in some cases recommendations to refrain from this approach have been made. Here we test if a common widespread species with no obvious signs of local adaptation may be a candidate species for abandoning LIB during restoration. Using 10 microsatellite markers we compared population genetic patterns of the generalist species Daucus carota in indigenous and formerly restored sites (nonlocal seed provenances). Gene diversity overall ranged between He =  0. 67 and 0. 86 and showed {{no significant differences between}} the two groups. Hierarchical AMOVA and principal component analysis revealed very high genetic population admixture and negligible differentiation between indigenous and restored sites (FCT =  0. 002). Moreover, differentiation between groups was caused by only one outlier population, where inbreeding effects are presumed. We therefore conclude that the introduction of nonlocal seed provenances in the course of landscape restoration did not jeopardize regional species persistence by contributing to <b>inbreeding</b> or outbreeding <b>depressions,</b> or any measurable adverse population genetic effect. On the basis of these results, we see no obvious objections to the current practice to use the 10 -fold cheaper, nonlocal seed material of D.  carota for restoration projects...|$|R
