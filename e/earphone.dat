The as-produced CNT thin yarn <b>earphone</b> has a working element called CNT thin yarn thermoacoustic chip. Such a chip is composed of a layer of CNT thin yarn array supported by the silicon wafer, and periodic grooves with certain depth are made on the wafer by micro-fabrication methods to suppress the heat leakage from the CNT yarn to the substrate.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} crystal receivers did {{not have}} a tuned circuit at all, and just consisted of a crystal detector connected between the antenna and ground, with an <b>earphone</b> across it. Since this circuit lacked any frequency-selective elements besides the broad resonance of the antenna, it had little ability to reject unwanted stations, so all stations within a wide band of frequencies were heard in the <b>earphone</b> (in practice the most powerful usually drowns out the others). It was used in the earliest days of radio, when only one or two stations were within a crystal set's limited range.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, {{researchers}} of Tsinghua University further {{present a}} thermoacoustic <b>earphone</b> of carbon nanotube thin yarn and a thermoacoustic surface-mounted device. They are both fully integrated devices and compatible with Si-based semiconducting technology.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} principle used {{in crystal}} radio design to transfer maximum {{power to the}} <b>earphone</b> is impedance matching. The maximum power is transferred {{from one part of}} a circuit to another when the impedance of one circuit is the complex conjugate of that of the other; this implies that the two circuits should have equal resistance. However, in crystal sets, the impedance of the antenna-ground system (around 10-200 ohms) is usually lower than the impedance of the receiver's tuned circuit (thousands of ohms at resonance), and also varies depending {{on the quality of the}} ground attachment, length of the antenna, and the frequency to which the receiver is tuned.|$|E

25|$|Passive noise {{isolation}} is essentially using {{the body of}} the <b>earphone,</b> either over or in the ear, as a passive earplug that simply blocks out sound. The headphone types that provide most attenuation are in-ear canal headphones and closed-back headphones, both circumaural and supra aural. Open-back and earbud headphones provide some passive noise isolation, but much less than the others. Typical closed-back headphones block 8 to 12dB, and in-ears anywhere from 10 to 15dB. Some models have been specifically designed for drummers, with the aim to be able to monitor the recorded sound while shutting out the sound coming directly from the drums {{at the same time as}} much as possible. Such headphones claim to reduce ambient noise by around 25dB.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} phase of the reconstruction, the {{galleries}} were removed and the interior of the church was significantly brightened. A new entrance porch took the place of the old vestibule and allowed additional seating. The roof was found to be in serious disrepair and was entirely reconditioned with the plaster ceiling replaced by a panelled and embossed wooden design. The floor was also replaced and a new heating system installed along with pendant lanterns. Records show that a new pulpit, font and lectern were also gifted and installed during this first phase of the reconstruction. At the same time, a Minister's chair and an acousticon <b>earphone</b> installation were also gifted. A second phase of reconstruction was planned which was to include a new chancel, vestries and session house.|$|E
25|$|As {{a crystal}} radio has no power supply, the sound power {{produced}} by the <b>earphone</b> comes solely from the transmitter of the radio station being received, via the radio waves captured by the antenna. The power available to a receiving antenna decreases with the square of its distance from the radio transmitter. Even for a powerful commercial broadcasting station, if {{it is more than}} {{a few miles from the}} receiver the power received by the antenna is very small, typically measured in microwatts or nanowatts. In modern crystal sets, signals as weak as 50 picowatts at the antenna can be heard. Crystal radios can receive such weak signals without using amplification only due to the great sensitivity of human hearing, which can detect sounds with an intensity of only 10âˆ’16 W/cm2. Therefore, crystal receivers have to be designed to convert the energy from the radio waves into sound waves as efficiently as possible. Even so, they are usually only able to receive stations within distances of about 25 miles for AM broadcast stations, although the radiotelegraphy signals used during the wireless telegraphy era could be received at hundreds of miles, and crystal receivers were even used for transoceanic communication during that period.|$|E
50|$|Acoustic tube {{headphones}} (also called pneumatic <b>earphones</b> or air <b>earphones)</b> {{are used}} especially in two-way radio. These are useful because a clear tube {{can be used}} to hide the <b>earphones.</b> They are also sometimes used for the microphone on telephonists headsets and to provide music to patients undergoing an MRI scan, as it would be dangerous to use metal wiring in the scanner's magnetic field.|$|R
30|$|For brain studies, and in {{particular}} quantitative and modelling studies, the <b>earphones</b> presented here should be the recommended system, as they combine favourable noise reduction of 30 [*]dB and practical handling, despite the higher effort required for the patient to apply the <b>earphones.</b> An additional positive side effect is that these compact <b>earphones</b> offer an easier handling in the tight brain and head coils of MR systems. The <b>earphones</b> described here have been in use since 2009 when the MR-BrainPET system first came into use at the Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich. Subsequently, an equivalent solution from Magnacoustic Inc., called MagnaCoils ([URL] has been introduced and is offered by allMRI GmbH and by Siemens. Since this system has a similar noise reduction as the in-house built <b>earphones</b> used by us and is considerably more expensive, we {{feel that there is}} no reason to replace our solution.|$|R
40|$|Interaural {{attenuation}} (IA) {{was evaluated}} for pure tones (frequency range 125 to 16000 Hz) using Sennheiser HDA 200 circumaural <b>earphones</b> and Telephonics TDH- 39 P <b>earphones</b> in nine unilaterally deaf subjects. Audiometry {{was conducted in}} 1 -dB steps using the manual ascending technique in accordance with ISO 8253 - 1. For all subjects and for all tested frequencies, the lowest IA value for HDA 200 was 42 dB. The present IA values for TDH- 39 P <b>earphones</b> closely resemble previously reported data. The findings show that the HDA 200 <b>earphones</b> provide more IA than the TDH- 39 P, especially at lower frequencies (<or= 500 Hz). It is concluded that contralateral masking should be applied during pure-tone audiometry with the HDA 200 <b>earphones</b> when the level at the test ear is more than 40 dB above {{the threshold of the}} non-test ear...|$|R

500|$|Kapadia {{once said}} she had always had {{aspirations}} to become an actress {{when she was a}} child, calling herself [...] "film-crazy". She was introduced by Raj Kapoor in his 1973 teen romance Bobby. While the film was to be Kapoor's son Rishi Kapoor's first leading role, Kapadia was given the title role of Bobby Braganza, a middle-class Goan Christian girl. The story follows how Bobby falls in love with Raj (Rishi), the son of a wealthy businessman, and how the two face the disapproval of their parents. Bobby was a major mainstream and critical success, and Kapadia was lauded for her performance, which won her the Filmfare Award for Best Actress (tied with Jaya Bhaduri for Abhimaan). In later years Kapadia would credit Raj Kapoor for her development as an actress: [...] "the sum total of me today as an actress, whatever I am, is Raj Kapoor." [...] Several of her lines in the film became popular, particularly, [...] "Mujhse dosti karoge?" [...] ("Will you be my friend?"). In 2008, Rediff.com ranked her performance in the film as the fourth-best female debut of all-time in Hindi cinema: [...] "An elfin little girl with big, lovely eyes, nobody quite portrayed innocence as memorably as Dimple in her first outing. She was candid, striking, and a true natural... here was a girl who would redefine glamour and grace, and make it look very, very easy indeed." [...] Following the success of the film, Kapadia's modern wardrobe and hairstyle in Bobby, consisting of [...] "knotted polka-dotted blouse and <b>earphone</b> hairstyle", made her a youth fashion icon of the times in India. Consequently polka-dotted dresses were often referred to as 'Bobby Print'. Bhawana Somaaya of The Hindu credits Kapadia as starting film memorabilia merchandising in India. Mukesh Khosla of The Tribune reported that Bobby established her as a [...] "cult figure" [...] as she led the fashion trends. Kapadia had married actor Rajesh Khanna in March 1973 at the age of 16 and eight months later her debut film released. She left the film industry to raise her children.|$|E

2500|$|A {{semiconductor}} crystal (detector) that demodulates {{the radio}} signal {{to get the}} audio signal (modulation). [...] The crystal detector is a nonlinear impedance that functions as a square law detector. The detector's output is converted to sound by the <b>earphone.</b> Early sets used a cat's whisker detector, consisting of a fine wire touching {{the surface of a}} sample of crystalline mineral such as galena. It was this component that gave crystal sets their name.|$|E
2500|$|The crystal {{detector}} worsened the problem, {{because it has}} relatively low resistance, thus it [...] "loaded" [...] the tuned circuit, drawing significant current and thus damping the oscillations, reducing its Q factor so it allowed through a broader band of frequencies. In many circuits, the selectivity was improved by connecting the detector and <b>earphone</b> circuit to a tap across {{only a fraction of}} the coil's turns. This reduced the impedance loading of the tuned circuit, as well as improving the impedance match with the detector.|$|E
