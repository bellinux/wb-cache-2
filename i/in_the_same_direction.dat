5|$|Improper {{adherence}} to these flag dimensions {{have led to}} embarrassing diplomatic incidents. During the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Chinese flags used during the opening ceremony and two medal ceremonies featured the four small stars incorrectly angled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>direction,</b> inciting fury in the Olympic organisers.|$|E
5|$|Air {{rises and}} rotates around a {{vertical}} axis, usually <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>direction</b> as low-pressure systems in both {{northern and southern}} hemisphere. They are most often cyclonic, that is, associated with a localized low-pressure region within a supercell. Such storms can feature strong surface winds and severe hail. Mesocyclones often occur together with updrafts in supercells, where tornadoes may form. About 1700 mesocyclones form annually across the United States, but only half produce tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Anonymous is {{the first}} internet-based super-consciousness. Anonymous is a group, {{in the sense that}} a flock of birds is a group. How do you know they’re a group? Because they’re {{travelling}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>direction.</b> At any given moment, more birds could join, leave, peel off in another direction entirely.|$|E

5|$|Another area of {{interest}} for Rubin was the phenomenon of counter-rotation in galaxies. Her discovery that some gas and stars moved {{in the opposite direction}} to the rotation {{of the rest of the}} galaxy challenged the prevailing theory that all of the material in a galaxy moved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>direction,</b> and provided the first evidence for galaxy mergers and the process by which galaxies initially formed.|$|E
5|$|Deformed matrices, {{consisting}} of randomly oriented nanochannels in a spongelike keratin matrix, create the diffuse non-iridescent blue colour of Ara ararauna, the blue-and-yellow macaw. Since the reflections {{are not all}} arranged <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>direction,</b> the colours, while still magnificent, do not vary much with angle, so they are not iridescent.|$|E
5|$|However, {{because the}} planet is {{rotating}} underneath the atmosphere, and frictional forces arise as the planetary surface drags some atmosphere with it, the air flow from center to periphery is not direct, but is twisted due to the Coriolis effect, or the merely apparent force that arise when the observer is in a rotating frame of reference. Viewed from above this twist in wind direction is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>direction</b> as {{the rotation of the}} planet.|$|E

5|$|If k is close, but not equal, to one, {{the second}} orbit resembles the first, but {{revolves}} gradually about {{the center of}} force; {{this is known as}} orbital precession (Figure3). If k is greater than one, the orbit precesses <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>direction</b> as the orbit (Figure3); if k is less than one, the orbit precesses in the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|Most large {{objects in}} orbit around the Sun lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, known as the ecliptic. The planets {{are very close to}} the ecliptic, whereas comets and Kuiper belt objects are {{frequently}} at significantly greater angles to it. All the planets, and most other objects, orbit the Sun <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>direction</b> that the Sun is rotating (counter-clockwise, as viewed from above Earth's north pole). There are exceptions, such as Halley's Comet.|$|E
5|$|Severe malaria {{is usually}} caused by P.falciparum (often {{referred}} to as falciparum malaria). Symptoms of falciparum malaria arise 9–30 days after infection. Individuals with cerebral malaria frequently exhibit neurological symptoms, including abnormal posturing, nystagmus, conjugate gaze palsy (failure of the eyes to turn together <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>direction),</b> opisthotonus, seizures, or coma.|$|E

5|$|The {{opposite}} of convergence is divergent evolution, where related species evolve different traits. Convergent evolution {{is similar to}} but different from parallel evolution. Parallel evolution occurs when two independent but similar species evolve <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>direction</b> and thus independently acquire similar characteristics; for instance, gliding frogs have evolved in parallel from multiple types of tree frog.|$|E
5|$|Tracks {{discovered}} by Matthew Mossbrucker (Morrison Natural History Museum, Colorado) suggest that Stegosaurus lived in multiple-age herds. One group of tracks is interpreted as showing {{four or five}} baby stegosaurs moving <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>direction,</b> while another has a juvenile stegosaur track with an adult track overprinting it. Stegosaurus may have preferred drier settings than other common Morrison Formation dinosaurs, such as Allosaurus, Apatosaurus, Camarasaurus, and Diplodocus.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa near Dakar, Senegal on September22. The wave traveled westward with minimal tropical cyclogenesis and reached the Lesser Antilles about a week later. While passing through the islands, heavy rainfall and strong winds were reported. Eventually, the system developed into a broad area of low pressure and acquired a low-level circulation. However, upper-level wind shear resulted in no immediate further organization. After crossing Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, wind shear decreased, since the low was moving <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>direction</b> as the upper-level winds.|$|E

5|$|Allenby's {{plan was}} to avoid {{fighting}} in or near Jerusalem but to cut all road access {{to the city and}} force the Ottoman Army to evacuate it. He ordered two infantry divisions; the 52nd (Lowland) (Major General J. Hill) and the 75th Division (Major General P. C. Palin), and two mounted divisions; the Yeomanry and the Australian Mounted Divisions to begin the advance. They were to move eastwards from Latron, which had been captured on 16 November, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>direction</b> as the Jaffa to Jerusalem road.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} this is the {{psychology}} of perception. Scientists working in this field have discovered general principles of the perception of forms. A law of the psychology of forms says that objects that move <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>direction</b> are perceived as related to each other. This law describes a relation between visual input and mental perceptual states. However, it does not suggest anything about the nature of perceptual states. The laws discovered by psychology are compatible with all the answers to the mind–body problem already described.|$|E
5|$|Around noon, Wallace {{began the}} journey along the Shunpike, a route {{familiar}} to his men. A member of Grant's staff, William R. Rowley, found Wallace between 2 and 2:30p.m. on the Shunpike, after Grant wondered where Wallace was {{and why he}} had not arrived on the battlefield, while the main Union force was being slowly pressed backward. Rowley told Wallace that the Union army had retreated, Sherman was no longer fighting at Shiloh Church, and the battle line had moved northeast toward Pittsburg Landing. If Wallace continued <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>direction,</b> he would have {{found himself in the}} rear of the advancing Confederate troops.|$|E
