40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Earth</b> <b>flows</b> are mass {{movements}} of fine-grained soils {{that range from}} slow flows with velocities {{on the order of}} meters or less per year to rapid flows that have velocities as high as several meters per second. Slow <b>earth</b> <b>flows</b> form in deposits of fine-grained plastic clay or silt and move episodically or by sustained, relatively steady movement. Most slow <b>earth</b> <b>flows</b> move primarily by sliding on a basal shear surface, accompanied by internal deformation. Coulomb plastic-flow models may be used to describe the mechanics of slow <b>earth</b> <b>flows.</b> Most rapid <b>earth</b> <b>flows</b> form in highly sensitive clay deposits and usually progress to completion {{in a matter of minutes}} to hours by a sequence of smaller failures that spontaneously liquefy and flow out of the source area. Rapid <b>earth</b> <b>flows</b> may be modeled as non-Newtonian fluids...|$|R
40|$|Landslides {{caused by}} rain often {{take the form}} of <b>earth</b> <b>flows</b> when they reach their final stage in river valleys. Conventional steel grid- or slit-type sabo dams were {{originally}} developed for debris flows containing boulders at their leading edge and do not contain <b>earth</b> <b>flows</b> as effectively as they contain the flows for which they were designed. If the volume behind these types of dams is not quickly filled by a debris <b>flow,</b> subsequent <b>earth</b> <b>flows</b> pass through the dam, because these subsequent flows are composed of less coarse rock and gravel. Therefore, we designed and built several model sabo dams with closely-spaced horizontal units. We then conducted hydraulic experiments focusing on the effects of these closely-spaced horizontal units, with the objective of ensuring that they capture materials in the later phases of debris flows. Experimental results indicated that this new design of sabo dam is better at capturing finer sediments in both debris <b>flows</b> and <b>earth</b> <b>flows...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the morphological and morphometric properties of debris slides-rapid <b>earth</b> <b>flows</b> which {{have occurred in}} pyroclastic deposits of the Campania region {{over the last few}} centuries. The slopes bordering the main carbonate massif of western Campania are covered by several metres of pyroclastic deposits from the Somma-Vesuvio volcano that, due to the steepness of the slopes, are easily eroded by surface waters and periodic debris slides-rapid <b>earth</b> <b>flows.</b> These flows are sudden and unpredictable, and have caused both damage to the environment and loss of life over the last few decades. After consulting scientific papers and historical documents, the areas most recently affected by debris slides-rapid <b>earth</b> <b>flows</b> were analysed through aerial photographs and a geological survey. An inventory of 172 landslides was produced, and landslides were mapped at a scale of 1 : 2000 for further geomorphological and morphometric analysis. Morphological analysis was primarily concerned with predisposing factors; it confirmed that 86 % of the slope failure crowns developed in response to man-made cuts and tracks (44 %), or due to the presence of cliffs (42 %). Two different kinds of slopes are affected by debris slides-rapid earth flows: slopes lacking drainage basins and slopes cut by one or several drainage basins. Typical triangular-shaped <b>earth</b> <b>flows</b> with a landslide mass located {{at the foot of the}} slope (unchannelled debris slides-rapid <b>earth</b> <b>flows)</b> were found along the former slopes. In contrast, channelled debris slides rapid <b>earth</b> <b>flows</b> formed along the latter slopes. These originated in the drainage divide area, developed along the main water segment and invaded the alluvial plain far from the foot of the slope. An intermediate group of flows started as triangular shaped and then became channelled. Morphometric analysis also investigated the parameters most commonly found in the literature (slope angle of the crown and sliding zone, crown altitude, areal extent of the landslide), together with other parameters (apical angle of the crown zone and landslide body, slope relief energy and potential zone of triggering). This analysis identified critical values for the steepness of crown zones and for the steepness of the sliding zone. Critical values of the apical angle of the crown zone for mixed and unchannelled landslides were also established. Correlations among some of the investigated parameters were investigated; in particular, the relationships between slope relief energy and areal extent of landslides or the height of the landslide crown zone. All the factors and parameters analysed in this paper can be used to identify areas which need to be stabilized or monitored, and could be important for planning defensive measures of debris slides-rapid <b>earth</b> <b>flows...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{coupling}} {{relationships between}} hillslope and channel network are fundamental for {{the understanding of}} mountainous landscapes' evolution. Here, we applied dendrogeomorphic methods to identify the hillslopeâchannel relationship and the sediment transfer dynamics within an alpine catchment, at the highest possible resolution. The Schimbrig catchment {{is located in the}} central Swiss Alps and can be divided into two distinct geomorphic sectors. To the east, the Schimbrig <b>earth</b> <b>flow</b> is the largest sediment source of the basin, while to the west, the Rossloch channel network is affected by numerous shallow landslides responsible for the supply of sediment from hillslopes to channels. To understand the connectivity between hillslopes and channels and between sources and sink, trees were sampled along the main Rossloch stream, on the Schimbrig <b>earth</b> <b>flow</b> and on the Rossloch depositional area. Geomorphic observations and dendrogeomophic results indicate different mechanisms of sediment production, transfer and deposition between upper and lower segments of the channel network. In the source areas (upper part of the Rossloch channel system), sediment is delivered to the channel network through slow movements of the ground, typical of <b>earth</b> <b>flow,</b> shallow landslides and soil creep. Contrariwise, in the depositional area (lower part of the channel network), the mechanisms of sediment transfer are mainly due to torrential activity, floods and debris flows. Tree analysis allowed the reconstruction of periods of high activity during the last century for the entire catchment. The collected dataset presents a very high temporal resolution but we encountered some limitations in establishing the source-to-sink connectivity at the catchment-wide scale. Despite these uncertainties, for decennial timescales the results suggest a direct coupling between hillslopes and neighbouring channels in the Rossloch channel network, and a de-coupling between sediment sources and sink farther downstream, with connections possible only during extraordinary events...|$|E
