5|$|Association football, {{the modern}} game, also has {{documented}} <b>early</b> <b>involvement</b> of women. An annual competition in Mid-Lothian, Scotland during the 1790s is reported, too. In 1863, football governing bodies introduced standardised rules to prohibit {{violence on the}} pitch, making it more socially acceptable for women to play. The first match recorded by the Scottish Football Association took place in 1892 in Glasgow. In England, the first recorded game of football between women took place in 1895.|$|E
5|$|Duvall, who had {{appeared}} in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), which Foote adapted from the Harper Lee novel, was involved in Tender Mercies as an actor and co-producer from its earliest stages. He said the script appealed to him because of the basic values it underlined and because the themes were universal even though the story was local. Duvall felt it portrayed people from the central region of the United States without parodying them, as he said many Hollywood films tend to do. Duvall's <b>early</b> <b>involvement</b> led to rumors that he had requested Foote write the script for him, something that both men denied.|$|E
5|$|In {{possibly}} {{the last years}} of the 15th century, the Sanmicheli were involved in the stone decoration of the Caprioli chapel in the Church of San Giorgio, for which Cairano, almost simultaneously, prepared his Adoration, demonstrating for the first time outside of the Loggia a cooperation between the two studios. Bartolomeo Sanmicheli, {{at the beginning of the}} new century, attempted at this point to make a comeback in the local art scene with the Ark of San Tiziano of 1505, characterized by a strong decorative quality. He possibly also aspired to the commission of the ark of Sant'Apollonio, which had been up for grabs since the discovery of the relics of the holy bishop in 1503. An <b>early</b> <b>involvement</b> of Sanmicheli can be surmised in the Martinengo mausoleum, but the commission was awarded to Bernardino dei Crossi in 1503. However, based on the prevailing decorative nature of the monument, which is much more rigorously classical, it can be attributed to Cairano.|$|E

5|$|Penda's brother Eowa {{was also}} said by the Historia Brittonum and the Annales Cambriae {{to have been}} a king of the Mercians at the time of Maserfield. The {{question}} of what sort of relationship of power existed between the brothers before the battle is a matter of speculation. Eowa may have simply been a sub-king under Penda and {{it is also possible that}} Penda and Eowa ruled jointly during the 630s and early 640s: joint kingships were not uncommon among Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of the period. They may have ruled the southern and northern Mercians respectively. That Penda ruled the southern part is a possibility suggested by his <b>early</b> <b>involvement</b> in the area of the Hwicce, to the south of Mercia, as well as by the fact that, after Penda's death, his son Peada was allowed to rule southern Mercia while the northern part was placed under direct Northumbrian control.|$|E
5|$|Quwatli's <b>early</b> <b>involvement</b> in the Arab {{nationalist}} movement {{came through the}} Arab Congress of 1913. Shortly after starting his career at the Ottoman civil service in Damascus, he received an invitation to attend the conference in Paris. However, the conference was strongly condemned by the Ottoman authorities, and Arab notables were forbidden from attending. Nevertheless, the congress had succeeded in rousing nationalist feelings in Arab provinces. Quwatli's first confrontation with the Ottoman authorities came in February 1914 during a visit by Jamal Pasha, the governor of Syria at the time, to {{the offices of the}} Governorate of Damascus, where Quwatli worked. During the visit, Quwatli refused to follow the normal protocol—bending over and kissing Jamal Pasha's right hand—and was promptly thrown in prison at the Citadel of Damascus. He was bailed out of prison a few days later through his family's connections, but he lost his job at the civil service.|$|E

25|$|Cruikshank's claims {{surrounding}} {{the works of}} Dickens and Ainsworth stem from his <b>early</b> <b>involvement</b> with Ainsworth as illustrator for various works by Ainsworth that were published in The Bentley's Miscellany and the Ainsworth's Magazine.

25|$|Wan Chai's Gloucester Road, a east-west {{trunk route}} along the {{northern}} coast, is connected to Cross-Harbour Tunnel, the first undersea tunnel in Hong Kong. This tunnel {{is connected to the}} south by a direct viaduct from its landing point on Hong Kong Island to the Aberdeen Tunnel towards the southern coast. Connecting Hong Kong Island at Kellet Island (the site of the Royal Navy Club) to a reclaimed site at Hung Hom Bay in Kowloon, this tunnel provides a direct link by road. Prior to the tunnel's opening in 1972, local drivers and pedestrians depended solely upon the Star Ferry services to cross the Victoria Harbour. Linking the main financial districts on both sides of Victoria Harbour, the tunnel carries 123,000 vehicles daily. On the other hand, the thoroughfare Queen's Road East, an extension from Queen's Road West at Kennedy Town, through Queen's Road Central at Central, Queensway at Admiralty, takes a southerly route to provide an alternative east-west road link. Due to Wan Chai's <b>early</b> <b>involvement</b> in the British colonial administration, road names were often taken from previous Governors, such as Hennessy Road, and notable people (Gloucester Road, Jaffé Road, Lockhart Road, Johnston Road, Fleming Road, Luard Road, O'Brien Road, Marsh Road, Stewart Road, McGregor Street, etc.).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. The Dutch Ministry of Transport {{aims for}} <b>earlier</b> <b>involvement</b> of {{contractors}} for strengthening its road development planning. Traditionally, in the Netherlands a tender procedure for infrastructure does not start until the public decision-making procedure is fully completed. This leaves {{little room for}} innovations by contractors. In the new strategy for <b>early</b> contractor <b>involvement</b> the tender procedure and the infrastructure planning procedure are carried out simultaneously. Added value {{is to be found}} in the area of early use of knowledge and creativity of the contractors (innovation), gaining time and better project control (‘better value for tax-payers money’). This paper examines <b>early</b> contractor <b>involvement</b> in four projects for infrastructure. Subsequently, it discusses the lessons learned addressing issues such as: challenges and practical problems, pitfalls and consequences for the tender strategy of early contracting...|$|R

500|$|As a young woman, Elizabeth Cady met Henry Brewster Stanton {{through her}} <b>early</b> <b>involvement</b> in the temperance and the {{abolition}} movements. Henry Stanton was {{an acquaintance of}} Elizabeth Cady's cousin, Gerrit Smith, an abolitionist {{and member of the}} [...] "Secret Six" [...] that supported John Brown's raid at Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. Stanton was a journalist, an antislavery orator, and, after his marriage to Elizabeth Cady, an attorney. Despite Daniel Cady's reservations, the couple was married in 1840, with Elizabeth Cady requesting of the minister that the phrase [...] "promise to obey" [...] be removed from the wedding vows. She later wrote, [...] "I obstinately refused to obey one with whom I supposed I was entering into an equal relation." [...] The couple had six children between 1842 and 1856. Their seventh and last child, Robert, was an unplanned baby born in 1859 when Elizabeth Cady Stanton was forty-four.|$|E
500|$|In {{her third}} chapter, Greenwood {{examines}} her experiences among London's ceremonial magicians, focusing on her {{training in the}} Hermetic Qabalah, a [...] "magical language" [...] for exploring the otherworld. Adopting Luhrmann's concept of [...] "interpretative drift", she relates how she shifted her understanding of events {{to make sense of}} her magical experiences. However, in contrast to Luhrmann's emphasis on how practitioners overcame their initial scepticism, Greenwood focuses on how these practitioners learn [...] "the language of another mode of reality" [...] through their experiences. Chapter four details Greenwood's <b>early</b> <b>involvement</b> in Wicca, through three separate covens. Offering her thoughts on Wiccan invocations, she then discusses the faith's approach to sexual polarity, pointing to the sexual underpinnings of the Great Rite and the Gnostic Mass as evidence. The chapter is rounded off with an explanation of how Wicca understands the natural world and a comparison between the religion and ceremonial magic.|$|E
500|$|Gibson's <b>early</b> <b>involvement</b> {{with the}} film {{industry}} extended far {{beyond the confines of}} the Hollywood blockbuster system. At one point, he collaborated on a script with Kazakh director Rashid Nugmanov after an American producer had expressed an interest in a Soviet-American collaboration to star Soviet rock musician Viktor Tsoi. Despite being occupied with writing a novel, Gibson was reluctant to abandon the [...] "wonderfully odd project" [...] which involved [...] "ritualistic gang-warfare in some sort of sideways-future Leningrad" [...] and sent Jack Womack to Russia in his stead. Rather than producing a motion picture, a prospect that ended with Tsoi's death in a car crash, Womack's experiences in Russia ultimately culminated in his novel Let's Put the Future Behind Us and informed much of the Russian content of Gibson's Pattern Recognition. A similar fate befell Gibson's collaboration with Japanese filmmaker Sogo Ishii in 1991, a film they planned on shooting in the Walled City of Kowloon until the city was demolished in 1993.|$|E
