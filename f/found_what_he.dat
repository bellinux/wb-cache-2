In addition to furs and the company of free-spirited, rugged mountain men, Carson sought action and adventure. He <b>found</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was looking for in killing and scalping Indians. Carson probably killed and took the scalp of his first Indian when he {{was nineteen}} years old, during Ewing Young's expedition.|$|E
25|$|The pontoon hull {{was built}} of soft Siemens steel framing and 11 {{millimeters}} thick sheet iron. In November 1879, when the double bottom was 2/3 complete (but not formally laid down yet), Popov persuaded the imperial authorities to award interior finishes contact to the British, and hired Tideman {{to review the}} design again. Tideman built another 1:10 scale model, ran another series of tests and recommended changes to the powerplant and propeller arrangement that caused a significant extension of the contract. The Livadia had a double, perfectly flat bottom and only 7ft (2.1 m) of draft, excluding the propellers. Their blades projected 9 feet below the hull. Tideman <b>found</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> claimed was near-perfect propeller configuration: all three screws had the same diameter but varied in blade pitch, which in practice required running the engines at different revolutions per minute.|$|E
25|$|Alan Rickman was Tykwer's {{first choice}} to play Richis {{and the role}} was not offered to anyone else. Tykwer and Eichinger looked through {{hundreds}} of audition tapes {{to find the right}} actress for the role of Richis' daughter Laura. Tykwer believed he had found the right actress on a tape with 15 actresses but couldn't remember exactly which was the one he liked. Eichinger looked through the tape and <b>found</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thought was a suitable person. It turned out that both men had chosen the same actress, Rachel Hurd-Wood. Tykwer went to London to cast her personally. A new tape was recorded and she was given the role. A suitable actress could not be found for the role of the plum girl in England and the United States so Tykwer decided to look at actresses in Germany. Karoline Herfurth, who had twice worked with Tykwer, was asked to do a screen test with Whishaw, in costume. Herfurth proved herself to Tykwer and her role was expanded.|$|E

25|$|Some {{years later}} in St. Louis McKeag runs into Lise and her daughter, who is now nearly grown. He reveals to Lise that Clay Basket is the same woman McKeag had told Lise he loved, decades earlier at Lise & Pasquinel's wedding. The townswoman convinces McKeag to confront Pasquinel about this fact, {{since it is the}} reason their friendship-partnership split so long ago. McKeag follows Lise's advice, and goes looking for Pasquinel to tell him of his love for Clay Basket. The {{brothers}} Marcel and Jacques have left on their own, while Pasquinel has taken Clay Basket and his newest daughter Lucinda (Cristina Raines) up into the mountains. In a valley on a small creek, the aged Pasquinel finally finds Lame Beaver's original vein of gold. He joyously plucks gold out of the water, having at last <b>found</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> has sought half his life. It is at this moment that McKeag arrives, as do Pawnee braves. The Pawnee shoot Pasquinel with multiple arrows and kill him. The heartbroken Clay Basket and McKeag can only watch, and then hold the dying voyageur in their arms.|$|E

Structurally, Smith <b>found</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had written was similar to the Only Ones's 1979 hit [...] "Another Girl, Another Planet". When he brought an instrumental demo of the song to the album recording sessions in Southern France, Cure drummer Boris Williams increased the tempo and added an opening drum fill which inspired Smith to introduce each instrument singularly and in sequence.|$|E

500|$|In 1996 Graham Budd <b>found</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{considered}} {{evidence of}} short, un-jointed legs in Opabinia. His {{examination of the}} anomalocarid Kerygmachela from the Sirius Passet lagerstätte, about [...] and over 10Myears older than the Burgess Shale, convinced him that this had similar legs. He considered the legs of these two genera {{very similar to those}} of the Burgess Shale Aysheaia and the modern onychophorans, which are regarded as closely related to the ancestors of arthropods. After examining several sets of features shared by these and similar lobopods he drew up a [...] "broad-scale reconstruction of the arthropod stem-group", in other words of arthropods and what he considered to be their evolutionary [...] "aunts" [...] and [...] "cousins". One striking feature of this family tree is that modern tardigrades may be Opabinias closest living evolutionary relatives.|$|E
500|$|In {{the ensuing}} battle inside the volcano, Helga {{and the other}} mercenaries {{including}} Rourke are all killed. Milo and the others successfully fly the crystal back to the city, as the volcano erupts. With lava flowing towards the city, Kida (in her crystal form) rises {{into the air and}} creates a protective shield. The lava breaks away harmlessly, showing a restored Atlantis, and the crystal returns Kida to Milo. The surviving crew members return to the surface and promise to keep the discovery of Atlantis a secret. Having fallen in love with Kida, Milo stays behind to help her rebuild the lost empire. In the final scene, the crew members, having made their fortunes from the rewards given to them by the Atlanteans, speak with Mr. Whitmore and insist that the expedition was unsuccessful. [...] However, they do give him a small package from Milo, containing an Atlantean crystal and a note saying he <b>found</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was looking for.|$|E
500|$|The first archaeological {{report on}} the then {{demolished}} church of St Mary was published by George Dowker in 1878. He described finding {{the foundations of the}} apsidal chancel and of the columns that formed part of the triple chancel arch, and noted that the original floor of the church was of concrete, or opus signinum, more than [...] thick. The floor had previously been described in 1782, prior to the church's demolition, as polished smooth and finished in red, a sample having been taken with difficulty using a pickaxe. Within the floor Dowker also <b>found</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> believed were the foundations for the stone cross described by Leland, and noted that the concrete floor appeared to have been laid around them. The floor of the chancel appeared to have been raised by about [...] when the chancel was extended in the Early English period, and had been covered with encaustic tiles. Dowker also reported hearing from a Mr Holmans about the existence of a large, circular burial vault at the east end of the chancel, containing coffins arranged in a circle.|$|E

2500|$|He {{has been}} doing {{research}} into clerics who are secretly atheists and how they rationalize their works. He <b>found</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> called a [...] "Don't ask, don't tell" [...] conspiracy because believers {{did not want to}} hear of loss of faith. That made unbelieving preachers feel isolated but {{they did not want to}} lose their jobs and sometimes their church-supplied lodgings and generally consoled themselves that they were doing good in their pastoral roles by providing comfort and required ritual. The research, with Linda LaScola, was further extended to include other denominations and non-Christian clerics. The research and stories Dennett and LaScola accumulated during this project were published in their 2013 co-authored book, Caught in the Pulpit: Leaving Belief Behind.|$|E

He noted that the images of Buddha were made of gilded plaster. The other two groups identified by Zhou {{appear to have been}} those of the Brahmans and of the Shaivites. About the Brahmans, Zhou had little to say, except that they were often employed as high officials.

50|$|Definitely back to Malta from Italy in 1911, Dimech <b>founded</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> called Ix-Xirka ta' l-Imdawlin (The League of the Enlightened; {{pronounced}} ishirka taal imdaaulin).

Through this league Dimech hoped to have a say, and transformative influence, in the political, and then the social, and maybe also the religious, fields. Young idealists and people craving for change flocked to him, and not only from the lower class but also from the middle and higher classes. Dimech’s political “revolution” had begun.|$|R

2500|$|The {{release of}} a new {{television}} series, , prompted a further revision in the depiction of Klingon culture, though Gene Roddenberry had wanted to avoid re-appearances of races from the old series. Set a century later than the original series, the USS Enterprise-D featured a Klingon crewmember, Worf. Makeup artist Michael Westmore needed a consistent reference to base the Klingon look on, as each individual Klingon had distinct head ridges. He <b>found</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was {{looking for in a}} book of dinosaurs: observing dinosaur vertebrae laid out flat, Westmore cut the designs in half and modified them to suit each Klingon. Westmore designed his Klingons' beards to be Elizabethan, combining prehistoric and aristocratic elements to give audiences a feeling of depth from the appearance. Over time, Westmore and the other makeup artists designed different sizes of prosthetic headpieces which could be quickly applied and modified to save time; the amount of preparation to turn an actor into a Klingon decreased from around three hours to one. While important characters had custom headpieces, background actors used pre-made masks with minor touchup around the eyes and mouth. The Next Generation effects artist Dan Curry used his martial arts experience to create a flowing fighting style for the race. When the episode [...] "" [...] called for a special Klingon blade, Curry drew on Far East influences to develop a weapon known as the batleth. Curry, a collector of weapons, was annoyed by fictional weaponry that was designed to [...] "look cool" [...] but could not be handled practically. Curry combined elements of the Himalayan kukri, Chinese axes and fighting crescents to create a two-handed, curved weapon that has since been widely used in the franchise.|$|E
