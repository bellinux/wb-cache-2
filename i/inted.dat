40|$|AbstractLet D be {{the ring}} of {{integers}} of a number field K, P a prime of D for which q=|D/PD| is finite, νP the corresponding valuation of K and E a homogeneous subset of D with respect to P, i. e. a set with the property E=E+PℓD for some positive integer ℓ. Also let <b>Int(E,D)</b> denote {{the ring of}} polynomials in K[x] which take values in D when evaluated at points of E. The characteristic sequence of E with respect to P is the sequence of integers {α(n) =νP(In) :n= 1, 2, 3,…} where In is the fractional ideal formed by 0 and the leading coefficients of elements of <b>Int(E,D)</b> of degree ⩽n. In this paper we give a recursive method for computing the limit limn→∞α(n) /n for any homogeneous set, apply it to the special case of the homogeneous sets Z∖PℓZ⊆Z for ℓ= 1, 2, 3,…[*], and show that in general the possible values of this limit as E ranges over all possible homogeneous subsets are dense in the interval (1 /(q− 1),∞). We also apply this method to certain infinite unions of homogeneous sets and obtain formulas for these limits as regular continued fractions...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{manufacturing}} ﬁrms have exerted huge impacts {{toward the}} degradation of the environment. It’s essential for the ﬁrms to implement green practices in order to conserve the Mother Nature. However, {{the intention of the}} ﬁrms to practice green supply chain initiatives (GSCI) remained ambiguous. Hence, this research was carried out to analyze the factors inﬂuencing the intention to adopt GSCI in manufacturing ﬁrms. Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) model with three attributes, namely attitude (ATT), subjective norm (SN) and perceived behavioral control (PBC) was applied as a framework to predict the intention to adopt green purchasing (INTGP), eco-design (<b>INTED)</b> and reverse logistics (INTRL). The data was successfully collected from 50 respondents at Electronics & Electrical (E&E) manufacturing ﬁrms in Penang. Purchasing and Operation & Production manager’s intention were treated as the proxy to ascertain the ﬁrm’s behavioral intention. Data was analyzed by using the IBM Statistical Package for Social Science Software (SPSS 22). Multiple regressions were carried out for hypotheses testing. TPB attributes were able to explain 46. 5 % of variance in INTGP, 9. 8 % of variance in <b>INTED</b> and 23 % of variance in INTRL. Consequently, PBC was the only signiﬁcant predictor of INTGP and INTRL. The results provide practical implications for researcher, managers, as well as practitioners to implement strategies for behavioral intervention and designation of policy to inﬂuence ﬁrm’s intention to practice GSC...|$|E

40|$|Instruction {{may be seen}} as the {{intentional}} creation of conditions around learning so as to facilitate the achievement of determined goals. Normally, instruction is based upon certain educational strategies. It is well accepted in the field of educational technology that these strategies should be founded on a theoretical framework. However, the adoption of epistemological perspectives for instructional design is not enough. It would also be useful to count on the knowledge and experience of qualified instructional designers. The expert system introduced in this paper, called <b>INTED,</b> tries to capture the knowledge of instructional designers and so it is capable of recommending suitable strategies that facilitate the design of learning environments. For that purpose, the system developed is based upon a pattern of instruction which synthesizes theories, research results and experience in order to converge towards the accomplishment of an instructional design which will be highly effective in terms of achievement of its educational goals.
