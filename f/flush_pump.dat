40|$|This study {{examines}} the fresh and <b>flushing</b> water <b>pump</b> installations for high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong {{in terms of}} system availability, mean time to failure, {{mean time between failures}} and restoration time. Together with some reliability data published elsewhere, it applies Bayesian analysis to improve our understanding of the downtime characteristics of water pump installations. For three consecutive years (2005 - 2007), water pump failures in 46 typical high-rise residential buildings were recorded to determine the component failure rates. In order to study the failure patterns, Monte Carlo simulations were performed for the operations of 100 parallel pump sets over a period of 10 years. The mean time to failure, total downtime, failure counts and system availability estimated for the fresh water pump installations were 1. 24 years, 8990 h, 709 and 90 % while those estimated for the <b>flushing</b> seawater <b>pump</b> installations were 0. 46 years, 4049 h, 2081 and 78 %, respectively. The results are useful in the calculation of water supply availability for high-rise residential buildings while keeping the balance between maintenance cost and system reliability. This study also demonstrates a method for reliability modelling of water supply for high-rise residential buildings.

The aim of the TCI is to independently measure ambient air in parallel to the standard station instrumentation, thus providing a comprehensive comparison that includes the sample intake system, the instrument itself as well as its calibration and data evaluation. Observed differences between the TCI and the Heidelberg gas chromatographic system, which acted as a reference for the TCI, were − 0. 02 ± 0. 08 μmol mol − 1 for CO 2 and − 0. 3 ± 2. 3 nmol mol − 1 for CH 4. Over a period of two weeks each, the continuous CO 2 and CH 4 measurements at two ICOS field stations, Cabauw and OPE, were compared to co-located TCI measurements. At Cabauw mean differences of 0. 21 ± 0. 06 μmol mol − 1 for CO 2 and 0. 41 ± 0. 50 nmol mol − 1 for CH 4 were found. For OPE the mean differences were 0. 13 ± 0. 07 μmol mol − 1 for CO 2 and 0. 44 ± 0. 36 nmol mol − 1 for CH 4.

40|$|Water {{level and}} current {{measurements}} from two virtually enclosed South Pacific atolls, Manihiki and Rakahanga, support a new lagoon flushing mechanism which {{is driven by}} waves and modulated by the ocean tide for virtually enclosed atolls. This is evident because the lagoon water level remains above the ocean at all tidal phases (i. e., ruling out tidal flushing) and because the average lagoon water level rises significantly during periods with large waves. Hence, we develop a model by which the lagoons are <b>flushed</b> by waves <b>pumping</b> of ocean water into the lagoon and gravity draining water from the lagoon over the reef rim. That is, the waves on the exposed side push water into the lagoon {{during most of the}} tidal cycle while water leaves the lagoon on the protected side for most of the tidal cycle.

50|$|On a ship, oil often leaks from {{engine and}} {{machinery}} spaces or from engine maintenance activities and mixes with {{water in the}} bilge, the lowest part of the hull of the ship, {{but there is a}} filter to clean bilge water before being discharged. Oil, gasoline, and by-products from the biological breakdown of petroleum products can harm fish and wildlife and pose threats to human health if ingested. Oil in even minute concentrations can kill fish or have various sub-lethal chronic effects. Bilge water also may contain solid wastes and pollutants containing high levels of oxygen-demanding material, oil and other chemicals. A typically large cruise ship will generate an average of 8 metric tons of oily bilge water for each 24 hours of operation. To maintain ship stability and eliminate potentially hazardous conditions from oil vapors in these areas, the bilge spaces need to be <b>flushed</b> and periodically <b>pumped</b> dry. However, before a bilge can be cleared out and the water discharged, the oil that has been accumulated needs to be extracted from the bilge water, after which the extracted oil can be reused, incinerated, and/or offloaded in port. If a separator, which is normally used to extract the oil, is faulty or is deliberately bypassed, untreated oily bilge water could be discharged directly into the ocean, where it can damage marine life. A number of cruise lines have been charged with environmental violations related to this issue in recent years.|$|R
40|$|This poster {{describes}} {{a pilot study}} to develop the sampling methodology required to investigate the occurrence and distribution of “emerging organic contaminants” in groundwater {{in an area of}} anticipated contamination. The study site was the BGS Oxford Observatory on the Port Meadow, within a peri-urban setting, including an area of ancient grassland on the gravels of the flood plain of the River Thames to the northwest of Oxford. Groundwater levels suggest that the regional groundwater flow in the superficial deposits is from northeast to southwest under the main Thames. The site is periodically inundated and groundwater is predominantly reducing. The meadow is flanked on its eastern edge by a closed landfill which accepted all categories of waste from 1937 up to 1980. The leachate plume can be identified across the site by high conductivity, Cl, HCO 3, SO 4 and DOC. Part of the landfill is now used as allotments. A series of shallow piezometers were sampled in July 2011 for organic micropollutants from the plume, upgradient in the meadow and towards the urban area, across the river and from the river. Samples were collected using a small peristaltic pump equipped with new PTFE tubing. Great care was taken to <b>flush</b> the <b>pumping</b> system with sample and to avoid contamination of the pump or collection bottles. Samples were analysed by the Environment Agency NLS using the semi-quantitative GCMS screening method developed for their organic micropollutant monitoring programme. The results showed that organic micropollutants were present at all sites and included both priority pollutants and emerging contaminants. A total of 26 compounds were detected with N-butyl benzene sulphonamide (BBSA) being both the most frequently detected compound and with the highest maximum concentration. Four priority pollutants were detected, trichloroethene, octyl phenol, anthracene and fluoranthene, and one pesticide, metaldehyde. Some discrimination was evident with the Thames and urban areas showing a different fingerprint from the landfill plume: •	Urban sites upgradient of the landfill: phthalate and BBSA plasticisers, poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), triphenyl phosphate, anti-epileptic drugs •	Portmeadow site upgradient from the landfill: BBSA only •	Sites in the plume: trichloroethene, 1, 4 -dioxane, barbiturates, phthalate and BBSA plasticisers, metaldehyde, crotamitron •	Site across the river: 1, 4 -dioxane, phthalate and BBSA plasticisers, metaldehyde •	River Thames: phthalate and BBSA plasticisers, caffeine, anti-epileptic drugs, PAH The next phase of the project will investigate changes in the occurrence of organic micropollutants during the autumn and winter when groundwater levels are higher and there is floodplain inundation...|$|R
40|$|The F-area pump {{tanks are}} used to {{transfer}} supernate, sludge, and other materials. In any transfer, the solution must stay well mixed without allowing particulate matter to settle out of the liquid and, thus, accumulate {{in the bottom of}} the pump tank. Recently, the pulse jet mixing in F-area Pump Tank 1 (FPT 1) has been decommissioned. An analysis of the liquid transfer through FPT 1 has been performed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods to assess whether or not the velocities throughout the tank will remain high enough to keep all particulate suspended using only transfer and recirculation pumps. The following paragraph is an abbreviated synopsis of the transfer procedure for FPT 1 [1, 2]. Prior to a transfer, FPT 1 begins to be filled with inhibited water through the inlet transfer line (TI). When the tank liquid level reaches 52. 5 inches above the absolute tank bottom, the recirculation pump (RI and RO) is activated. At a tank liquid level of 72. 5 inches above the absolute tank bottom, the outlet transfer line (TO) is activated to reduce the liquid level in FPT 1 and transfer inhibited water to H-area Pump Tank 7 (HPT 7). The liquid level is reduced down to 39. 5 inches, with an allowable range from 37. 5 to 41. 5 inches above the absolute tank bottom. HPT 7 goes through a similar procedure as FPT 1 until both have tank liquid levels of approximately 39. 5 inches above the absolute tank bottom. The transfer of inhibited water continues until a steady-state has been reached in both pump tanks. At this point, the supernate/sludge transfer begins with a minimum flow rate of 70 gpm and an average flow rate of 150 gpm. After the transfer is complete, the pump tanks (both FPT 1 and HPT 7) are pumped down to between 20. 5 and 22. 5 inches (above absolute bottom) and then flushed with 25, 000 gallons of inhibited water to remove any possible sludge heal. After the <b>flushing,</b> the <b>pump</b> tanks are emptied. Note that the tank liquid level is measured using diptubes. Figure 2. 1 provides a simplified sketch (not to scale) of FPT 1 during the steady-state transfer condition, which consists of two inlet flows that impact the liquid surface as plunging jets and two outlet flows drawn from near the bottom of the tank. During the transfer, the supernate level is held at 39. 5 inches above the absolute bottom of the tank [1, 2]. In addition, the FPT 1 can contain up to 16. 7 wt. % sludge particles within the supernate for a given transfer [2]. Test results from Tank 40 sludge Batch 3 [3] provide a typical range of particulate diameters between 0. 1 and 25 {micro}m, with approximately 20 vol. % of the sludge distribution consisting of particles less than 1 {micro}m in diameter. The purpose of this analysis is to estimate FPT 1 flow field during the steady-state transfer conditions to ensure that the tank remains mixed and that the velocities throughout the tank are sufficient to keep all sludge particulate suspended...|$|R
40|$|Current spacecraft-compatible {{cleaning}} protocols {{involve a}} vapor degreaser, liquid sonication, and alcohol wiping. These methods {{are not very}} effective in removing live and dead microbes from spacecraft piece parts of slightly complicated geometry, such as tubing and loosely fitted nuts and bolts. Contamination control practices are traditionally focused on cleaning and monitoring of particulate and oily residual. Vapor degreaser and outgassing bakeout have not been proven {{to be effective in}} removing some less volatile, hydrophilic biomolecules of significant relevance to life detection. A precision cleaning technology was developed using supercritical CO 2 (SCC). SCC is used as both solvent and carrier for removing organic and particulate contaminants. Supercritical fluid, like SCC, is characterized by physical and thermal properties that are between those of the pure liquid and gas phases. The fluid density {{is a function of the}} temperature and pressure. Its solvating power can be adjusted by changing the pressure or temperature, or adding a secondary solvent such as alcohol or water. Unlike a regular organic solvent, SCC has higher diffusivities, lower viscosity, and lower surface tension. It readily penetrates porous and fibrous solids and can reach hard-to-reach surfaces of the parts with complex geometry. Importantly, the CO 2 solvent does not leave any residue. The results using this new cleaning device demonstrated that both supercritical CO 2 with 5 % water as a co-solvent can achieve cleanliness levels of 0. 01 mg/cm 2 or less for contaminants of a wide range of hydrophobicities. Experiments under the same conditions using compressed Martian air mix, which consists of 95 % CO 2, produced similar cleaning effectiveness on the hydrophobic compounds. The main components of the SCC cleaning system are a high-pressure cleaning vessel, a boil-off vessel located downstream from the cleaning vessel, a syringe-type high-pressure pump, a heat exchanger, and a back pressure regulator (BPR). After soaking the parts to be cleaned in the clean vessel for a period, the CO 2 with contaminants is flushed out of the cleaning vessel using fresh CO 2 in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) method. The contaminants are either precipitating out in the boil-off container or being trapped in a filter subsystem. The parts to be cleaned are secured in a basket inside and can be rotated up to 1, 400 rpm by a magnetic drive. The fluid flows within the vessel generate tangential forces on the parts surfaces, enhancing the cleaning effectiveness and shortening the soaking time. During the FIFO <b>flushing,</b> the <b>pump</b> subsystem pushes fresh CO 2 into the cleaning vessel at a constant flow rate between 0. 01 and 200 mL/min, while the BPR regulates the pressure in the cleaning vessel to within 0. 1 bar by controlling the needle position in an outlet valve. The fresh CO 2 gas flows through the heat exchanger at a given temperature before entering the cleaning vessel. A platinum resistance thermometer (PRT) reads the cleaning vessel interior temperature that can be controlled to within 0. 1 K. As a result, cleaning vessel temperature remains constant during the FIFO flushing. There is no change in solvent power during FIFO flushing since both temperature and pressure inside the cleaning vessel remain unchanged, thus minimizing contaminants left behind. During decompression, both temperature and pressure are strictly controlled to prevent bubbles from generating in the cleaning vessel that could stir up the contaminants that sank to the bottom by gravity...|$|R
40|$|Mangroves {{provide a}} range of {{important}} ecosystem services, notably being efficient blue carbon sinks. In addition to their CO 2 fixing ability, these coastal tropical forests can store large amount of carbon in their soils due to waterlogging inducing slow rates of organic matter (OM) decomposition. The French Guiana coastline is a highly dynamic environment, characterized {{by a series of}} migrating mudbanks. Within this specific sedimentological context, only A. germinans propagules can develop at the highest elevation of mudbanks that are stabilized only for a few decades before being eroded. As a result, a clear zonation pattern, with mangrove stands of different ages paralleling the shoreline, allows the study at the same time of A. germinans forests from pioneer to mature and senescent stands. The unique characteristic of this system is the isolation of the older mangroves from the sea, being situated more than 2 km from the shoreline, which limits sedimentation and allochthonous inputs. Within the studied chronosequence, soil carbon stocks and carbon burial rates of each mangrove stand were determined. The thickness of the pedogenetic layer, enriched in autochthonous OM, reached an asymptote (similar to 45 cm) for the mixed mature and senescent forests (> 40 years old), probably {{as a result of the}} asymptote reached by the net primary productivity (NPP) and low sedimentation rates. The organic carbon stock in the pedogenetic layers increased linearly with forest age, from 4 to 107 Mg OC ha (- 1) in pioneer and senescent stages, respectively. Consequently, considering only the pedogenetic layers, enriched with the OM derived from the current forest, soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks are limited. It is suggested that tidal export of the NPP may balance low mineralization rates induced by waterlogging, at least for the stand the closest to the sea. The mean carbon burial rate for this system was 2. 3 Mg OC ha(- 1) yr(- 1), with values ranging from 0. 72 to 4. 86 Mg OC ha (- 1) yr(- 1) depending on forest age and position of the stand in the tidal zone. The latter, either promoting tidal <b>flushing</b> and tidal <b>pumping</b> on the seaward side of the mangrove, or the development of associated mangrove species on the landward side due to freshwater proximity and low sedimentation rates, influenced organic accumulation in soils...|$|R
