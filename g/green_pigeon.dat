5|$|The spotted <b>green</b> <b>pigeon</b> {{was shown}} to be closest to the Nicobar pigeon. The genetic {{distance}} between the two was more than is seen within other pigeon species, but similar to the distance between different species within the same genus. This confirmed that the two were distinct species in the same genus, and that the spotted <b>green</b> <b>pigeon</b> was a unique, extinct taxon. The Caloenas genus {{was placed in a}} wider clade in which most members showed a mixture of arboreal (tree-dwelling) and terrestrial (ground-dwelling) traits. That Caloenas was placed in such a morphologically diverse clade may explain why many different relationships have previously been proposed for the members of the genus. A third species in the genus Caloenas, the Kanaka pigeon (C. canacorum), is only known from subfossils discovered in New Caledonia and Tonga. This species was larger than the two other members of the genus, so it is unlikely that it represents the same species as the spotted <b>green</b> <b>pigeon.</b> The possibility that the spotted <b>green</b> <b>pigeon</b> was a hybrid between other species can also be disregarded based on the genetic results.|$|E
5|$|The {{behaviour}} of {{the spotted}} <b>green</b> <b>pigeon</b> was not recorded, but theories {{have been proposed}} based on its physical features. Gibbs found the delicate, part-feathered legs and long tail indicative of at least partially arboreal habits. After noting that the wings were not short after all, van Grouw stated that the bird {{would not have been}} terrestrial, unlike the related Nicobar pigeon. He pointed out that the overall proportions and shape of the bird (longer tail, shorter legs, primary feathers probably reaching the middle of the tail) was more similar to the pigeons of the genus Ducula. It may therefore have been ecologically similar to those birds, have likewise been strongly arboreal, and kept to the dense canopy of forests. By contrast, the mainly terrestrial Nicobar pigeon forages on the forest floor. The dark eyes of the Nicobar pigeon are typical of species that forage on forest floors, whereas the coloured bill and presumably coloured eyes of the spotted <b>green</b> <b>pigeon</b> {{are similar to those of}} frugivorous (fruit-eating) pigeons. The feet of the spotted <b>green</b> <b>pigeon</b> are also similar to those of pigeons that forage in trees. The slender bill indicates that it fed on soft fruits.|$|E
5|$|The spotted <b>green</b> <b>pigeon</b> is {{most likely}} extinct, and may already have been close to {{extinction}} by the time Europeans arrived in its native area. The species may have disappeared due to being over-hunted and being preyed upon by introduced animals. Hume suggested that the bird may have survived until the 1820s.|$|E

50|$|The {{site has}} been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports populations of bar-necked cuckoo-doves, Timor <b>green</b> <b>pigeons,</b> pink-headed imperial pigeons, yellow-crested cockatoos, olive-headed lorikeets, Jonquil parrots, Timor friarbirds, flame-eared honeyeaters, plain gerygones, olive-brown orioles, Timor stubtails, Timor leaf warblers, spot-breasted heleias, chestnut-backed thrushes and orange-sided thrushes.|$|R
5|$|The {{distribution}} of the Nicobar pigeon and the Kanaka pigeon (which {{does not appear to}} have had diminished flight abilities) suggests dispersal through island hopping and an origin for the spotted <b>green</b> <b>pigeon</b> in Oceania or southeast Asia. The fact that the closest relatives of Caloenas were the extinct subfamily Raphinae (first demonstrated in a 2002 study), which consists of the dodo from Mauritius and the Rodrigues solitaire from Rodrigues, indicates that the spotted <b>green</b> <b>pigeon</b> could also have originated somewhere in the Indian Ocean. In any case, it seems most likely that the bird inhabited an island location, like its relatives. That the Caloenas pigeons were grouped in a clade at the base of the lineage leading to Raphinae indicates that the ancestors of the flightless dodo and Rodrigues solitaire were able to fly, and reached the Mascarene Islands by island hopping from south Asia.|$|E
5|$|The {{triangular}} {{spots of}} the spotted <b>green</b> <b>pigeon</b> {{are not unique}} among pigeons, but are also seen in the spot-winged pigeon (Columba maculosa) and the speckled pigeon (C. guinea), and {{are the result of}} lack of melanin deposition during development. The yellow-buff coloured spots are very worn, while less worn feathers have white tips; this indicates that the former were stained during life or represent a different stage of plumage, and that the latter were fresher. The plumage of the spotted <b>green</b> <b>pigeon</b> was distinct in being very soft compared to that of other pigeons, perhaps due to the body feathers being proportionally long. The hackles were not as elongated as those of the Nicobar pigeon, and the feathers did not differ from those of other pigeons in their microstructure. The plumage was also distinct in being very pigmented, except for the tips of the feathers, and even the down was dark, unlike that of most other birds (a feature otherwise seen in aberrant plumage).|$|E
5|$|Though the plumage of {{the spotted}} <b>green</b> <b>pigeon</b> {{resembles that of}} the Nicobar pigeon in some respects, it is also {{similar to that of}} species in the {{imperial}} pigeon genus Ducula. The metallic-green colouration is commonly found among them, and similar hackles {{can be seen in the}} goliath imperial pigeon (D. goliath). The Polynesian imperial pigeon (D. aurorae) has similar soft feathers, and immature individuals of this species and the Pacific imperial pigeon (D. pacifica) have plumage different from that of juvenile and adult birds until they moult. Therefore, vanGrouw found it possible that the dull, brownish-black underparts of the surviving spotted <b>green</b> <b>pigeon</b> specimen represents the plumage of an immature bird, as the adults of similar birds have stronger and more glossy iridescence. He suggested that the brighter bird with paler underparts and whiter wing tips seen in Latham's illustration may represent the adult plumage.|$|E

5|$|The spotted <b>green</b> <b>pigeon</b> or Liverpool pigeon (Caloenas maculata) is {{a species}} of pigeon which is most likely extinct. It was first {{mentioned}} and described in 1783 by John Latham, who had seen two specimens of unknown provenance and a drawing depicting the bird. The taxonomic relationships of the bird were long obscure, and early writers suggested many different possibilities, though {{the idea that it}} was related to the Nicobar pigeon (C. nicobarica) prevailed, and it was therefore placed in the same genus, Caloenas. Today, the species is only known from a specimen kept in World Museum, Liverpool. Overlooked for much of the 20th century, it was recognised as a valid extinct species by the IUCN Red List only in 2008. In 2014 a genetic study confirmed it as a distinct species related to the Nicobar pigeon, and showed that the two were the closest relatives of the extinct dodo and Rodrigues solitaire.|$|E
5|$|The 2002 study {{indicated}} that the ancestors of the Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo diverged around the Paleogene-Neogene boundary. The Mascarene Islands (Mauritius, Réunion, and Rodrigues), are of volcanic origin and are less than 10 million years old. Therefore, the ancestors of both birds probably remained capable of flight for a considerable time after the separation of their lineage. The Nicobar and spotted <b>green</b> <b>pigeon</b> were placed {{at the base of}} a lineage leading to the Raphinae, which indicates the flightless raphines had ancestors that were able to fly, were semi-terrestrial, and inhabited islands. This in turn supports the hypothesis that the ancestors of those birds reached the Mascarene islands by island hopping from South Asia. The lack of mammalian herbivores competing for resources on these islands allowed the solitaire and the dodo to attain very large sizes. The dodo lost the ability to fly owing to the lack of mammalian predators on Mauritius. Another large, flightless pigeon, the Viti Levu giant pigeon (Natunaornis gigoura), was described in 2001 from subfossil material from Fiji. It was only slightly smaller than the Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo, and it too is thought to have been related to the crowned pigeons.|$|E

5|$|When {{examining}} the specimen, van Grouw {{noticed that the}} legs had at one point been detached and are now attached opposite their natural positions. The short feathering of the legs would therefore have been attached to the inner side of the upper tarsus in life, not the outer. The plate accompanying Forbes' 1898 article shows the feathers on the outer side, and depicts the legs as pinkish, whereas they are yellow in the skin. The spotted <b>green</b> <b>pigeon</b> has at times been described as having a knob {{at the base of}} its bill, {{similar to that of the}} Nicobar pigeon. This idea seems to have originated with Forbes, who had the bird depicted with this feature, perhaps due to his conviction that it was a species of Caloenas; it was depicted with a knob as late as 2002. This is despite the fact that the surviving specimen does not possess a knob, and Latham did not mention or depict this feature, so such depictions are probably incorrect. The artificial eyes of the specimen were removed when it was prepared into a study skin, but red paint around the right eye-socket suggests that it was originally intended to have red eyes. It is unknown whether this represents the natural eye colour of the bird, yet the eyes were also depicted as red in Latham's illustration, which does not appear to have been based on the existing specimen. Forbes had the iris depicted as orange and the skin around the eye as green, though this was probably guesswork.|$|E
