500|$|Kulwicki {{began his}} racing {{career as a}} 13-year-old kart racer. His father built engines as the crew chief for Norm Nelson and Roger McCluskey's United States Automobile Club (USAC) racecars. Because his work {{involved}} travel, Kulwicki's father was unable to help his son at most kart races, so Kulwicki's resourcefulness was often tested trying {{to find someone to}} transport his kart to the track. Even when Kulwicki asked his father for advice, he typically ended up doing most of the work himself. [...] "I showed him how", Gerry Kulwicki said. [...] "And he said: 'Why don't you do it? You can do it better.' And I said, 'Well, if you <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while, you can do it better.'" ...|$|E

I'm absolutely loving the opportunity to explore her backstory." [...] Speaking about her reaction to the plot she continued, [...] "I was like, 'Oh my gosh!' I was so shocked but absolutely chuffed to bits {{because this is what}} all actors want â€“ something massive like this to sink my teeth into. I feel so privileged that they've trusted me with this story. I know they've wanted to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while and they've finally chosen me!" ...|$|E

[...] Cover artist Stanley Donwood said: [...] "In Rainbows {{was very much a}} definitive statement, and that isn't where the band are at the moment.

And we wanted to make the album representative of that." [...] Multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood told Rolling Stone that the band had not wanted to [...] "pick up guitars and write chord sequences. We didn't want to sit {{in front of a computer}} either. We wanted a third thing, which involved playing and programming." ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{years after}} his retirement, in May 1964, Governor John J. McKeithen came to his office hoping that Middleton would accept a job on a {{commission}} that he was forming. The governor was wanting to ease the state's growing racial tensions by creating a biracial commission composed of 21 blacks and 21 whites. The governor needed a chairman who would command {{a tremendous amount of}} respect, and his choice was Middleton. Middleton said he would <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> year, beginning in 1965, but as had often happened in the past, the year stretched into five, and it wasn't until 1970 when the commission had reached its goals and was disbanded that Middleton was freed from this duty. [...] Middleton's black counterpart on the commission was Dr. Albert Dent, president of Dillard University in New Orleans, and the directors chosen to head the staff of this Commission on Human Relations, Rights, and Responsibilities were white attorney John Martzell and black attorney Jesse N. Stone. [...] Some of the potential trouble spots where the commission was able to have a positive effect included the towns of Ferriday and Opelousas, and the commission helped to open the ranks of the Louisiana State Police to qualified blacks. [...] The commission was disbanded in May 1970, after having effectively served its purpose, and the members each received a letter of thanks from the governor.|$|E
500|$|Several anime and manga {{publications}} {{have provided}} both praise and criticism of Sanosuke's character. Anime News Network said that Sanosuke's first {{fight in the}} series against Kenshin was stereotypical for an action series due to the differences between Sanosuke's and Kenshin's personalities, and to the music used in the anime that {{gives the impression that}} Kenshin would win. In the Critical Survey of Graphic Novels: Manga, multiple writers acknowledged how both Sanosuke and Yahiko spend their time in the series searching for ways to become stronger. However, they <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> heroic reason which is assisting Kenshin. SciFi.com commended him for being a good source of comic relief and described his appearance as a video-game icon. However, they commented he was a [...] "tragic figure [...] whose goofy peccadilloes have solid reasons behind them" [...] due to being unable to avoid the destruction of the Sekihotai army and feeling guilty due to it. Mania Entertainment praised Sanosuke's character development and transformation from an enemy of Kenshin into one of his most stalwart friends. In the [...] original video animation, Mike Crandol of Anime News Network referred to Sanosuke's revised design as [...] "pretty awkward" [...] since Crandol felt Sanosuke's original character design was [...] "perhaps being too cartoonish to translate well into this new style," [...] with the [...] "new style" [...] being the [...] "decidedly more realistic look" [...] exhibited in all of the Samurai X original video animations.|$|E

500|$|Various {{publications}} for manga, anime {{and other}} media have provided acclaim and criticism of Yahiko's character. While reviewing the volume 8 from the manga, Mania Entertainment writer Megan Lavey [...] applauded the way Yahiko starts acting much stronger after Kenshin's departure to Kyoto and noted that, {{along with the other}} characters starring in the volume, he is seen more in-depth. While reviewing volume 15, Lavey praised Yahiko's development during the series as he becomes a good fighter and his courage shows a remarkable potential to become a powerful swordsman. However, Carlos Ross from T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews criticized Yahiko for being [...] "a bit annoying" [...] during the start of the series but noted that he has his enjoyable moments. His design in the OVA series has drawn acclaim {{as one of the few}} to be well translated from his original manga design by Mike Crandol from Anime News Network. In the second review from the OVA, Crandol liked that Yahiko appeared several times in contrast to the previous OVA in which he was [...] "written out" [...] so that the story would focus more in Kamiya Kaoru and Kenshin's relationship. He also noted his battle against Himura Kenji to be very entertaining, but not as much as the previous fight which was between Kenshin and Yukishiro Enishi. Ridwan Khan from Animefringe noted the fight between Yahiko and Kenji had been long awaited, it was mostly overshadowed by Kenshin and Kaoru's ending. In the Critical Survey of Graphic Novels: Manga, multiple writers acknowledged how both Yahiko and Sagara Sanosuke spend their time in the series searching for ways to become. However, they <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> heroic reason which is assisting Kenshin.|$|E
500|$|On July 30, 2010, the NBC network {{announced}} that {{an episode of}} 30 Rocks fifth season would be filmed and broadcast live on two occasions in the evening of October 14, 2010. The decision was made {{in part due to}} lagging ratings for all of NBC's Must-See TV line-up. The idea was originally conceived during the 2007â€“2008 Writers Guild of America strike, when the cast performed two live versions of the season two episode [...] "Secrets and Lies" [...] as a benefit at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York City. When asked by Entertainment Weekly the reason for doing a live episode, Fey said [...] " [...] was what made us {{think that it would be}} fun to do [...] And how far we've come... Now we're going to do it on TV." [...] In this same interview, Fey revealed that the episode would also be performed in front of a live audience. [...] "It will be exciting for us to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> live audience and see if we get live laughter." [...] Fey noted that the experience [...] "was so fun to feel the different timing of the show live and the audience response, which you just don't get in a single-camera show." [...] In another interview, Fey revealed that the staff have talked about doing a live show for years [...] "because we felt we had sort of interesting personnel for it." [...] Following the conclusion of the writers' strike they spoke to NBC about performing live and attempted to film it during the fourth season; however, they were unable to schedule it. For the fifth season, the writing staff began planning the live performance and waited until McCarthy-Millerâ€”a recurring 30 Rock directorâ€”was available to helm it. Fey and Carlock said in separate discussions that another decision to do this episode of 30 Rock was based on the cast having theater and improvisation experience. Alec Baldwin had previously performed in the East and West live broadcasts of the Will & Grace [...] premiere episode, [...] "Alive and Schticking".|$|E
