5000|$|Australia had accrued {{substantial}} debt, {{mainly from}} Britain's independent banking sector, {{by the late}} 1920s - {{partly as a result}} of Prime Minister Bruce's [...] "Men, Money, Markets" [...] economic strategy, and partly because of the large war debt established during World War I. After the Wall Street Crash, the United States called in many of its World War I loans, including many from the UK, which, in turn called in its own loans from Australia. Australia had accumulated such massive debt that it was unable to repay even the interest on its loans. To avert total bankruptcy with the onset of the Australia's Great Depression, Australia asked Britain for a <b>deferment</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> on its war debts. To determine whether or not this was a viable financial option, the Bank of England sent Niemeyer to give an assessment of Australia and its financial situation.

40|$|Freedom of {{establishment}} {{statutes that}} restriction of citizens within the EU can not occur. A citizen {{should be free}} to establish themselves in a Member State and not be hindered if they choose to leave the State. "Citizens" also includes legal persons such as companies. Legislations in Member States which prevents the freedom of establishment shall be prohibited. When a company chooses to merge across borders and thus cease to be a Swedish company, the Swedish rules for exit taxation applies. This means that assets and unrealized gains will be taxed immediately. If the company instead chose to reorganize within the country, or to do nothing at all, a tax will only arise when the asset is sold. This different treatment could constitute a restriction of a company's freedom of establishment and thus discourage companies from moving to or from Sweden. The Malta case resulted in that the legislature introduced rules for <b>deferment</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> of tax. Today there is an opportunity for companies that choose to move abroad to obtain a suspension of the payment of taxes just to be more in line with the freedom of establishment. Companies must meet certain conditions in order to be granted a deferral. If a company carries out a merger that falls within Chapter 22. 5 § 2 p. IL, exit taxation will be applied. There is no possibility for a company, which is subject to exit taxation according to Chapter 22. 5 § 2 p. IL, to be subject to deferral rules since 2 p. is not covered by the rules of deferral. Only mergers according to Chapter 22. 5 § 4 and 5 p. IL. are subject to deferral. There are less restrictive measures to take than immediate taxation which is more in line with the freedom of establishment. Examples of less restrictive measures are an extension of the already existing deferral rules or taxing companies on the disposal of the assets...|$|E
40|$|Annual highway fuel {{taxes are}} {{collected}} by the Treasury Department {{and placed in the}} Highway Trust Fund (HTF). There is, however, no direct connection between the taxes {{collected by the}} Treasury Department and the gallons of on-highway fuel use, which can lead to a discrepancy between these totals. This study was conducted to determine how much of a discrepancy exists between the total fuel usages estimated based on highway revenue funds as reported by the Treasury Department and the total fuel usages used in the apportionment of the HTF to the States. The analysis was conducted using data from Highway Statistics Tables MF- 27 and FE- 9 for the years 1991 - 2001. It was found that the overall discrepancy is relatively small, mostly within 5 % difference. The amount of the discrepancy varies from year to year and varies among the three fuel types (gasoline, gasohol, special fuels). Several potential explanations for these discrepancies were identified, including issues on data, tax measurement, gallon measurement, HTF receipts, and timing. Data anomalies caused by outside forces, such as <b>deferment</b> <b>of</b> tax <b>payments</b> from one fiscal year to the next, can skew fuel tax data. Fuel tax evasion can lead to differences between actual fuel use and fuel taxes collected. Furthermore, differences in data collection and reporting among States can impact fuel use data. Refunds, credits, and transfers from the HTF can impact the total fuel tax receipt data. Timing issues, such as calendar year vs. fiscal year, can also cause some discrepancy between the two data sources...|$|R
