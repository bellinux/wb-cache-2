5|$|In 1628, an ecclesiastical case {{related to}} a game at East Lavant, near Chichester in West Sussex, being played on a Sunday. One of the {{defendants}} argued {{that he had not}} played during evening prayer time but only before and after.

5|$|As he grew older, he {{retained}} his famed elasticity but show signed of age {{in other}} areas, especially at the walk, which was his weakest skill in the dressage ring. Bonfire was retired from competition after the 2000 Olympic Games. To celebrate his retirement, there was a ceremony in Van Grunsven's home town and a farewell ride at an international jumping competition in Maastricht, Netherlands. After Bonfire's retirement, Van Grunsven stated that she never thought she would find another horse as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was; however, his successor Salinero proved {{to be even more}} successful.|$|E

That's a man I could envy." ...|$|R
5|$|Fourth-place {{finisher}} Hamilton said it {{had been}} a tough race for him because his car did not feel as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> hoped. He had also hoped the gap would be closer than it was in qualifying. Webber stated that he enjoyed {{the first part of the}} event and was looking forward to the next race of the season. Kovalainen was issued with an reprimand for his role in the collision with de la Rosa. He admitted that he was at fault for causing the incident because he was allowing another car to pass him and had not seen de la Rosa approaching him. Force India's chief operating officer Otmar Szafnauer said the confusion resulting in the error of fitting the wrong tyres for both their drivers was an example of cause and effect. He wanted to disregard the issue and look forward to the next few races. The team received a warning from the stewards and avoided disqualification because they had recognised their mistake immediately.|$|E
25|$|In 1628, an ecclesiastical case is {{preserved}} {{that relates to}} a game of cricket being played at East Lavant on a Sunday. Two defendants, Edward Taylor and William Greentree, were charged with playing cricket {{at the time of}} evening service. Taylor argued that he had not played during evening prayer time but only before and after. It did him no <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was fined the statutory 12d and ordered to do penance. Doing penance involved confessing his guilt to the whole East Lavant congregation the following Sunday.|$|E
25|$|The stars {{returned}} for the 1945–46 season, and Clapper {{led the team}} back to the Stanley Cup Final as player-coach. He retired as a player after the next season, becoming {{the first player to}} play twenty NHL seasons, but stayed on as coach for two more years. Brimsek proved to be not as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was before the war, and after 1946 the Bruins lost in the first playoff round three straight years, resulting in Clapper's resignation. Brimsek was traded to the last-place Chicago Black Hawks in 1949, followed by the unexpected lifetime ban of promising young star Don Gallinger on suspicion of gambling. The only remaining quality young player who stayed with the team for any length was forward Johnny Peirson, recognizable to fans of a later era as the Bruins' television color commentator in the 1970s.|$|E

60|$|This was {{all that}} was said on the subject. The thing was, as the captain said, settled off-hand, and {{accordingly}} next morning he conveyed such of his worldly <b>goods</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> meant to retain possession of to his sister's cottage--"the new ship", <b>as</b> <b>he</b> styled it. He carried his traps on his own broad shoulders, and the conveyance of them cost him three distinct trips.|$|R
25|$|With Jochen Rindt signing for Lotus for 1969, Oliver was out, {{switching}} to BRM. He was to suffer disappointing {{two years at}} the Bourne team, which would effectively kill off his Grand Prix career. In two years, he would muster just four finishes, with his only points scores being 6th place in the 1969 Mexican Grand Prix, and 5th in the 1970 Austrian Grand Prix. However, in 1970 he led much of the Race of Champions holding off Stewart and was a strong third {{for most of the}} Dutch and British GP. The poor result in the Austrian GP which Team boss, Lou Stanley thought he should have won, saw the best car go to Rodriquez from then on, but Oliver still led some laps at the slipstream Italian race. Stanley described Oliver, as 'good, but not nearly as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> thought'. The majority of his other races saw the BRM break down. Most pundits and sponsor, Yardley, were surprised and disappointed after Oliver was sacked by BRM. Jackie Stewart, judged Oliver a very good GP and Can Am driver.|$|E
25|$|A {{decade after}} the film was released, Redford, having made peace with Laurents, {{contacted}} him to discuss the possibility of collaborating on a new project, and eventually the two settled on a sequel to The Way We Were. In it, Hubbell and his daughter, a radical like Katie, would meet but be unaware of their relationship, and complications would ensue. Both agreed {{they did not want}} Pollack {{to be part of the}} equation. Laurents sent Redford the completed script but, aside from receiving a brief note acknowledging the actor had received it and looked forward to reading it, he never heard from him again. In 1982, Pollack approached Laurents about a sequel Stark had proposed, but nothing transpired following their initial discussion. In 1996, Streisand came across the sequel Laurents had written, and decided she wanted to produce and direct it as well as co-star with Redford, but did not want to work with Stark. Laurents thought the script was not as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> remembered it being, and agreed to rewrite it once Stark agreed to sell the rights to the characters and their story to Streisand. Again, nothing happened. The following year, Stark asked Laurents if he was interested in adapting the original film for a stage musical starring Kathie Lee Gifford. Laurents declined, and any new projects related to the film have been in limbo ever since.|$|E

[...] I feel I'm just as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> is." [...] Bell later recalled: [...] "Those two games against Ohio State were my biggest, and I consider the second game a personal victory.

500|$|Chaplin's silent films {{typically}} {{follow the}} Tramp's efforts {{to survive in}} a hostile world. The character lives in poverty and is frequently treated badly, but remains kind and upbeat; defying his social position, he strives {{to be seen as a}} gentleman. As Chaplin said in 1925, [...] "The whole point of the Little Fellow is that no matter how down on his ass he is, no matter how well the jackals succeed in tearing him apart, he's still a man of dignity." [...] The Tramp defies authority figures and [...] "gives as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> gets", leading Robinson and Louvish to see him as a representative for the underprivileged – an [...] "everyman turned heroic saviour". Hansmeyer notes that several of Chaplin's films end with [...] "the homeless and lonely Tramp [...] optimistically... into the sunset... to continue his journey".|$|E
500|$|Development of Solar 2 {{lasted for}} at least ten months. The game was {{developed}} using Microsoft XNA, a set of tools focused on video game development created by Microsoft. According to Watts, Solar 2 was [...] "mainly expanding on [...] original idea and polishing it to perfection." [...] However, he commented {{that the concept of}} both games took several design iterations to reach its final version: [...] "I played with many, many ideas before finally settling on what I have now." [...] Sound designer and musician JP Neufeld composed the game's score. According to Watts, this was done because there was [...] "no way I could do music as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> can." [...] Both the Windows and Xbox 360 version of the game were developed simultaneously. About the Xbox 360 version, Watts commented that [...] "the lack of keyboards and the aging Xbox 360 hardware were a bit tricky, and updating the Xbox version is a huge pain to do." ...|$|E

500|$|London's {{initially}} cool {{reception of}} Messiah led Handel {{to reduce the}} season's planned six performances to three, and not to present the work at all in 1744—to the considerable annoyance of Jennens, whose relations with the composer temporarily soured. [...] At Jennens's request, Handel made several changes in the music for the 1745 revival: [...] "Their sound is gone out" [...] became a choral piece, the soprano song [...] "Rejoice greatly" [...] was recomposed in shortened form, and the transpositions for Cibber's voice were restored to their original soprano range. Jennens wrote to Holdsworth on 30 August 1745: [...] " [...] has made a fine Entertainment of it, though not near so <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> might & ought to have done. I have with great difficulty made him correct some of the grosser faults in the composition..." [...] Handel directed two performances at Covent Garden in 1745, on 9 and 11 April, and then set the work aside for four years.|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Bonfire was retired, after {{a nine-year}} {{international}} career. The pair's gold-medal-winning freestyle dressage {{performance at the}} 1994 World Equestrian Games marked the first the time event had been held at the Games, and [...] "changed the world of dressage forever", according to fellow Olympic gold medalist Carl Hester. A statue was erected in Erp to mark Bonfire's achievements. In October 2013, he was euthanized following illness. After Bonfire's retirement, Van Grunsven stated that she never thought she would find another horse as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was; however, his successor Salinero proved {{to be even more}} successful. In March 2013, Salinero was retired. Van Grunsven and Salinero have been called the [...] "pioneers of the modern freestyle test", and were the first pair to have music written specifically for their performances. A horse known for his power and ability, he was also sensitive and, early in his career, prone to becoming tense, making him a more difficult horse to ride. Despite this, he was a star of the dressage world, winning numerous international competitions.|$|E
500|$|Kelly {{understands that}} co-writing with other songwriters lends power to his songs. [...] "You often write songs with {{collaborators}} {{that you would}} never write by yourself. It's a way of dragging a song out of you that you wouldn't have come up with". One of his collaborators, Linda Bull, described Kelly's process: they would start with a simple chat. [...] "We'd just chuck ideas around and he'd pick the best bits. He'd take all the bluntness and crudeness {{out of it and}} make it beautiful; that's his magic ... It's conversations that you have [...] ". Forster summarised his 2009 review of Kelly's compilation, Songs from the South, with [...] " [...] sound easy and approachable ... Then you think: If the songs are so simple and the ideas behind them so clear, why aren't more people writing like Paul Kelly and sounding as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> does?" [...] In 2010 Carmody and Kelly's [...] "From Little Things Big Things Grow" [...] was added to the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia Registry.|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched Star Trek: The Next Generation {{after the}} end of the series. Keith DeCandido for Tor.com {{described}} the episode as [...] "a nasty episode that doesn't quite cohere into the level of nasty it could", but that the series [...] "doesn't do horror/action all that often, and it serves as a good change of pace if nothing else". He gave [...] "Conspiracy" [...] a score of four out of ten. Zack Handlen, who reviewed the episode for The A.V. Club, thought that while [...] "Conspiracy" [...] was a [...] "hard episode to forget", it was not quite as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> remembered and did not quite [...] "fit" [...] with the rest of the season. He thought that certain parts of the plot were [...] "idiotic", and the Admirals reminded him of a [...] "Bond villain convention". He gave the episode an overall grade of B, writing, [...] "fingers crossed that next time we encounter a danger this sinister, the writers know how to handle it".|$|E
500|$|The AFL's {{experiment}} was largely derided by AFL personalities throughout Hunt's early Australian rules career. [...] Wayne Carey is quoted {{to have said}} that [...] "I just think he's really going to struggle. I'm just not sure a rugby player - as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> is - can do it." [...] Tony Shaw was quoted in 2011 to have said [...] "he just cannot play the game naturally and it won't work. Just say to him, 'Take your money, you've been fantastic for us', maybe see the year out, but I wouldn't be playing him very often any more." [...] Paul Roos is quoted to have said that [...] "a player of Karmichael Hunt's current ability would probably be worth only $100,000 in the AFL". [...] Jason Akermanis is quoted to have said in reference to both Hunt and Israel Folau – who converted from rugby league to Australian rules football the year after Hunt – that [...] "if they can't run and they can't handball - and we're only talking basics like kick, run, chase, handball and get body-to-body collisions - and can't get up to speed {{its going to be}} such {{a waste of time and}} money." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{addition}} of guitarist Henry McCullough, Wings' first concert tour began in 1972 with a debut performance {{in front of an}} audience of seven hundred at the University of Nottingham. Ten more gigs followed as they travelled across the UK in a van during an unannounced tour of universities, during which the band stayed in modest accommodation and received pay in coinage collected from students, while avoiding Beatles songs during their performances. McCartney later said, [...] "The main thing I didn't want was to come on stage, faced with the whole torment of five rows of press people with little pads, all looking at me and saying, 'Oh well, he is not as <b>good</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> was.' So we decided to go out on that university tour which made me less nervous... by the end of that tour I felt ready for something else, so we went into Europe." [...] During the seven-week, 25-show Wings Over Europe Tour, the band played almost solely Wings and McCartney solo material: the Little Richard cover [...] "Long Tall Sally" [...] was the only song that had previously been recorded by the Beatles. McCartney wanted the tour to avoid large venues; most of the small halls they played had capacities of fewer than 3,000 people.|$|E
