500|$|Following Heaven on Earth, Zinta took {{a two-year}} sabbatical from films, later {{explaining}} {{that she had}} chosen to focus on her work with her cricket team. In 2011 she launched her own production company, PZNZ Media. Two years later and following numerous delays, she starred in her first film under the banner—the Prem Raj-directed romantic comedy Ishkq in Paris, which she also co-wrote. An Indo-French collaboration, the film saw Zinta as a half-Indian half-French Parisian woman alongside Rhehan Malliek and Isabelle Adjani. Zinta's role required her to learn French and follow a strict diet and fitness regime, for which she hired the services of celebrity trainer Tracy Anderson. Whilst the film bombed {{at the box office}} and received mostly negative reviews, Zinta's performance attracted a mixed critical reception. Sonia Chopra of Sify called her [...] "hugely likeable", and added that she is a [...] "good actress, astute producer and ... writer." [...] Shilpa Jamkhandikar from Deccan Herald, critical of both the film and Zinta's work, concluded a scathing review by calling it [...] "a mediocre film, one that was supposed to showcase one of our favourite leading ladies, but instead <b>just</b> <b>shows</b> us what a shadow of her past she's become." ...|$|E
500|$|The 2012 Summer Games marked Sherab Zam's Olympic debut. She was {{the flag}} bearer {{at both the}} opening and closing ceremonies. She {{qualified}} for the individual archery competition after receiving a wildcard from the Tripartite Commission. In an interview with Reuters before the games Zam said that [...] "Participation {{is more important than}} winning a medal." [...] Zam spent time in South Korea and India preparing for the games. The archery events at the 2012 games were held at the Lord's Cricket Ground. Zam competed on 27 July in the ranking round, finishing 61st out of 64 competitors with 589 points. She scored 82 points less than the leading competitor, Ki Bo-bae of South Korea. Zam competed against American Khatuna Lorig, the fourth ranking athlete in the ranking round, in the round of 64. Lorig beat Zam three sets to none in about six minutes. This meant Zam was eliminated from the competition. After the games Zam said: [...] "I am not that good at archery but I love it. It was so good to meet world ranking archers who are famous and to watch how they do it. I have learnt a lot from them," [...] and that, [...] "When I grew up I never dreamt I would come to London, let alone compete in an Olympics. This <b>just</b> <b>shows</b> that anything is possible.

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Our Song" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy. [...] While listening to [...] "Our Song", Fanjoy shared her ideals for a music video with Swift. [...] "She had this idea for a front porch performance and then a field of flowers for another performance, then a black-and-white performance shot. It all came together in her head. She was able to translate that so well onto film. It <b>just</b> <b>shows</b> what a truly great director she is", Swift informed CMT News. The video was conceptualized to be very fantasy-like and surreal. The video begins with a shot of Swift's toenails as she paints them. Swift, casually wearing a blue tank top, white hot pants, and straightened hair, is revealed to be engaging in a phone conversation in a bedroom. A cut-scene shows Swift affront her bedroom mirror, which she writes the word [...] "Love", before furtively approaching a front porch, seen in [...] a blue dress and curly hair. Swift then sits near the edge and performs [...] "Our Song". The scene transitions to Swift lying {{on a bed of}} flowers and wearing an orange evening gown. She holds a card that spells her first name. Then, clothed by a long, black dress, black cowboy boots, and black gloves, Swift sings with a microphone and a backup band behind her in front of a white backdrop. Throughout the remainder of the video, scenes alternate between previous settings and concludes with Swift giggling while sitting on the front porch.|$|E

2500|$|The album Dusty in Memphis {{received}} excellent reviews on {{its initial}} releases {{both in the}} UK and US. Greil Marcus of Rolling Stone magazine wrote: [...] "most of the songs... {{have a great deal}} of depth while presenting extremely direct and simple statements about love... Dusty sings around her material, creating music that's evocative rather than overwhelming... Dusty is not searching – she <b>just</b> <b>shows</b> up, and she, and we, are better for it". Commercial and chart success failed to match critical success; the album did not crack the UK Top15 and peaked at No.99 on the Billboard 200, with sales of 100,000 copies. However, by 2001, the album had received the Grammy Hall of Fame award, and was listed among the greatest albums of all time by Rolling Stone, and in polls by VH1 artists, New Musical Express readers, and Channel 4 viewers.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2009, Nina {{released}} her fifth studio album, Renditions of the Soul, another cover album {{which came from}} her special weekly acoustic radio show of the same title which aired on Wave 89.1 during Friday and Sunday evenings. The album gave her record-producing debut when she produced all the album's tracks herself. It was well received by critics, with Manila Bulletin stating [...] "The 17-track album is more emotionally subtle, yet the songs just have as equally powerful messages like her previous hits [...] Nina’s singing perfectly renders the message of every selection: Love, longing and the purity of emotional surrender." [...] "I'm Yours" [...] was released in May 2010 as the only commercial single from the album. Warner held a sing-along contest for Nina fans and the winner {{got the chance to}} be on the single's music video. However, the single had no promotion, since Nina has left the label during its release. The video barely features her, and <b>just</b> <b>shows</b> some of her photos from the Renditions of the Soul album photo shoot.

For {{much of the}} episode, they believe that Agent Victoria Hand, who was introduced in [...] "The Hub", is a Hydra agent, and so the Big S.H.I.E.L.D. theme functions as the series' Hydra theme. Once John Garrett is revealed to be the traitor, and the Clairvoyant, the Centipede became the new Hydra theme, though McCreary continued to use his Garrett theme rather than outright replace it with the Hydra theme as Bill Paxton's [...] "performance after being revealed as the Clairvoyant is even more fun and energetic. So, his theme still fits him perfectly, it <b>just</b> <b>shows</b> us a different side of his personality." [...] With the second season came new Hydra characters, and their new MacGuffin, the Obelisk, for which McCreary wanted to use a Hydra theme. Feeling that his previous themes had become too complicated during the first season, and were too tied to that season's narrative, McCreary composed a new Hydra theme, which [...] "in true bad-guy-theme fashion ... is constructed from distantly related minor chords, and contains lots of close intervals." ...|$|E
