40|$|This Thesis {{examines}} {{the operation and}} dynamic characteristics of the dual-interleaved boost converter with <b>interphase</b> <b>transformer.</b> Due to its inherent high efficiency and potential for miniaturisation, the circuit {{is of particular interest}} for the emerging applications in electric vehicle power trains, for example to interface a low voltage fuel cell or battery to a high voltage traction system. The steady-state analysis of the converter focuses on understanding the shapes of the <b>interphase</b> <b>transformer</b> currents and identifying the boundary condition for continuous conduction of the transformer windings. The analysis Is also seen to be applicable to {{a modified version of the}} converter in which the freewheel diodes are replaced by a second pair of transistors, enabling zero voltage switching by appropriate choice of the <b>interphase</b> <b>transformer</b> inductance. The analysis predicts approximately the boundary of zero voltage switching operation. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

The paper will detail {{the implementation of the}} model and simulation results and timing. The whole system, with external I/O IGBT fiber optic gate signals, executes in real-time at 80 µs time step under the RT-Lab real-time distributed simulation software on a PC-cluster composed of 3 Pentium processors running at 1 GHz. The same model, but this time with only one bridge and no <b>interphase</b> <b>transformer,</b> runs in real-time at 65 µs time step...|$|E
40|$|Firing angle {{or source}} {{imbalances}} between 6 -pulse bridges comprising a 12 -pulse rectifier lead to current imbalance, {{due to the}} finite magnetizing inductance of the <b>interphase</b> <b>transformer.</b> The magnitude of the imbalance {{is limited by the}} negative feedback produced by load regulation of the 6 -pulse groups. This paper uses both an averaged model and a piecewise-linear simulation to obtain a quantitative understanding of this effect. The averaged model is used to predict steady-state current shifts and transient behavior. The piecewise-linear model of the system is then used to verify and extend the results via computer simulation. It is shown that the current imbalance can be accurately predicted by the averaged model, making the model suitable for both feedback control and <b>interphase</b> <b>transformer</b> design...|$|E

The importance of including the nonlinear magnetising inductance of the <b>interphase</b> <b>transformers</b> is illustrated. Small supply voltage distortions are seen to result in current imbalance in the <b>interphase</b> <b>transformers,</b> degrading the rectifier input current, and may lead to infringement of the power quality specification.

40|$|In this paper, {{computer}} simulation models {{of two different}} topologies of 18 -pulse rectifiers are presented. Each rectifier topology consists of three parallel, three-phase six-pulse full-bridge thyristor converters connected via <b>interphase</b> <b>transformers.</b> The influence of the <b>interphase</b> <b>transformer's</b> layout and AC line reactances variations on the particular thyristor converter current sharing is analysed. Various configurations of 18 -pulse rectifiers are examined by simulating operation with symmetric input voltage supply, {{as well as in}} the cases of different levels of voltage supply asymmetry, at unequal input conductors impedance, and at different thyristor voltage drops. According to {{computer simulation}} results, an optimal 18 -pulse rectifier circuit topology is recommended. The optimal topology has three AC line reactances with two input current-balancing <b>interphase</b> <b>transformers.</b> These added AC reactances are also involved with the current commutation process between thyristors. Application of the recommended optimal topology of an 18 -pulse rectifier could enable the reduction of the AC line reactances number from nine to three, while the dissipated power of the AC/DC converter's most loaded thyristor could be reduced by approximately 11 %. During the simulation of the nominally loaded 18 -pulse rectifier, in all considered cases the effective value of the output signal ripple below one promil of total current and voltage values has been achieved...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{present some}} aspects fromsimulation {{functioning}} of the modern supply for nonindustrialequipment, unlike the industrial powersupply installations, must have specific parameters(voltage and frequency). The role of the converter inthis system is to convert the alternative current of theindustrial supplying device to a continuous current;and again {{with the help of}} the inverter the DC voltageis converted back in AC voltage. High amount of direct current is essential in manyindustrial processes. Conventional methods forobtaining high amount of direct current involveparallel operation of converters with <b>interphase</b> or fiveleggedrectifier <b>transformer.</b> The interphasetransformer (IPT) and/or rectifier transformeremployed in the system increase overall size of thesystem and also provide limited control over theoperation. This paper presents simpler topology of highfrequency AC-DC converter specially for low-voltagehigh-current industrial applications. In the proposedtopology, rectifier module and low frequency L-C filterin the primary stage (required for conventional highfrequency converters) are eliminated. The topologyprovides better control over the operation and helps inreducing size of the overall rectifier system.

40|$|The {{parallel}} operation of two three-pulse controlled converters with <b>interphase</b> <b>transformer</b> (IPT) is modeled and analyzed. An IPT absorbs voltage difference between DC voltages {{of the two}} converters at any instant and ensures independent operation without any circulating current. It also results in six-pulse output voltage resulting in less harmonic distortions.

40|$|The Positron Accumulator Ring (PAR) {{consists}} of 8 dipole magnets connected in series. These magnets are energized via one 12 -pulse dc power supply. The power supply {{consists of}} four phase controlled half-wave wye group converters. Each of the two half-wave converters are connected through an <b>interphase</b> <b>transformer</b> to obtain a full-wave converter with 120 {degrees} conduction. The input voltage for these two half-wave converters are 180 {degrees} apart. The two full-wave converters are connected in parallel through a third <b>interphase</b> <b>transformer.</b> This type of connection of the converters not only provides the required output current, it also improves the input power factor of the power supply. The output of the wye group converters is filtered through a passive L-R-C filter to reduce the ripple content of the output current. At low current values of the power supply the current ripple is high, thus a large filter is needed, which adds {{to the cost of}} the power supply, however at high output current levels, the current ripple is less severe. The large size of the filter can be reduced by adding an anti-parallel rectifier diode(D 1) to the output of the power supply. A freewheeling diode(D 2) is connected before the choke to circulate the current once the power supply is turned off. In order to measure the current in the magnet a high precision, low drift, zero flux current transductor is used. This transductor senses the magnet current which provides a feedback signal to control the gating of the converter`s thyristors. A true 14 bit Digital to Analog Converter (DAC) is programmed by the control computer for the required current value, providing a reference for the current regulator. Fast correction of the line transients is provided by a relatively fast voltage loop controlled by a high gain slow response current loop...|$|E

40|$|Electric and hybrid-electric vehicle systems {{require an}} {{inverter}} {{to convert the}} direct current (DC) output of the energy generation/storage system (engine, fuel cells, or batteries) to the alternating current (AC) that vehicle propulsion motors use. Vehicle support systems, such as lights and air conditioning, also use the inverter AC output. Distributed energy systems require an inverter to provide the high quality AC output that energy system customers demand. Today's inverters are expensive due {{to the cost of}} the power electronics components, and system designers must also tailor the inverter for individual applications. Thus, the benefits of mass production are not available, resulting in high initial procurement costs as well as high inverter maintenance and repair costs. Electricore, Inc. (www. electricore. org) a public good 501 (c) (3) not-for-profit advanced technology development consortium assembled a highly qualified team consisting of AeroVironment Inc. (www. aerovironment. com) and Delphi Automotive Systems LLC (Delphi), (www. delphi. com), as equal tiered technical leads, to develop an advanced, modular construction, inverter packaging technology that will offer a 30 % cost reduction over conventional designs adding to the development of energy conversion technologies for crosscutting applications in the building, industry, transportation, and utility sectors. The proposed inverter allows for a reduction of weight and size of power electronics in the above-mentioned sectors and is scalable over the range of 15 to 500 kW. The main objective of this program was to optimize existing AeroVironment inverter technology to improve power density, reliability and producibility as well as develop new topology to reduce line filter size. The newly developed inverter design will be used in automotive and distribution generation applications. In {{the first part of this}} program the high-density power stages were redesigned, optimized and fabricated. One of the main tasks was to design and validate new gate drive circuits to provide the capability of high temp operation. The new power stages and controls were later validated through extensive performance, durability and environmental tests. To further validate the design, two power stages and controls were integrated into a grid-tied load bank test fixture, a real application for field-testing. This fixture was designed to test motor drives with PWM output up to 50 kW. In the second part of this program the new control topology based on sub-phases control and <b>interphase</b> <b>transformer</b> technology was successfully developed and validated. The main advantage of this technology is to reduce magnetic mass, loss and current ripple.
