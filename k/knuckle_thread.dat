5000|$|Other {{applications}} use a knuckle thread's rounded {{edges to}} reduce the stress on softer materials at a point of connection. Some linear actuators use a <b>knuckle</b> <b>thread</b> {{to reduce the}} wear of the steel leadscrew against a plastic sliding nut. Firefighting respirator standard EN 148-1 [...] "Respiratory protective devices - Threads for facepieces" [...] lists a <b>knuckle</b> <b>thread</b> to connect metal and rubber parts.|$|E
5000|$|... (g) <b>Knuckle</b> <b>thread</b> - Similar to {{a square}} thread {{in which the}} corners have been rounded {{to protect them from}} damage, also giving it higher friction. In {{low-strength}} applications it can be manufactured cheaply from sheet stock by rolling. It is used in light bulbs and sockets.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Knuckle</b> <b>threads</b> {{have very}} wide rounded crests and roots. These DIN <b>knuckle</b> <b>threads</b> {{also use a}} steep thread angle.|$|R
50|$|The rounded crest {{and root}} of <b>knuckle</b> <b>threads</b> resembles the Edison screw used on light bulbs, {{although}} bulbs {{have a much}} shallower thread angle than most <b>knuckle</b> <b>threads.</b> The root profile of <b>knuckle</b> <b>threads</b> resembles a ball screw thread, although the flank and crest of ball screw threads is often truncated.|$|R

5000|$|This thread form's good debris {{tolerance}} is {{the source}} of its use in oilfields, where it provides a leak-free connection in field use. Many European automobiles use a <b>knuckle</b> <b>thread</b> for their [...] "tow eye," [...] an external threaded recess where a steel towing lug can be fitted. For example, some Porsche cars use DIN 405 Rd 20 x 1/8", and some BMW use a thread similar to DIN 405 Rd 16 x 1/8".|$|E
50|$|<b>Knuckle</b> <b>threads</b> are {{an unusual}} highly rounded thread form. The large {{space between the}} rounded crests and roots {{provides}} space for debris to be shifted to {{not interfere with the}} thread, making this form resistant to debris and thread damage.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Knuckle</b> <b>threads</b> {{with a flat}} 30 degree flank {{thread angle}} are {{standardized}} in DIN 405 for inch pitches and diameters ranging from 8mm to 200mm. [...] A more recent standard DIN 20400 uses metric thread pitch and lists diameters from 10mm to 300mm. [...] As DIN is a German organization, many instances of the DIN thread charts write numbers with a comma as the decimal point. For a thread pitch p, the crest and root rounding radius is slightly less than p/4, and approximately the middle third of each thread flank is flat.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This work {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} mean Nusselt number, friction factor and thermal enhancement factor characteristics in a circular tube with different types of internal threads of 120 mm pitch under uniform wall heat flux boundary conditions. In the experiments, measured data are taken at Reynolds number in range of 7, 000 to 14, 000 with air as the test fluid. The experiments were conducted on circular tube with three different types of internal threads viz. acme, buttress and <b>knuckle</b> <b>threads</b> of constant pitch. The heat transfer and friction factor data obtained is compared with the data obtained from a plain circular tube under similar geometric and flow conditions. The variations of heat transfer and pressure loss {{in the form of}} Nusselt number (Nu) and friction factor (f) respectively is determined and depicted graphically. It is observed that at all Reynolds number, the Nusselt number and thermal performance increases for a circular tube with buttress threads as compared with a circular tube with acme and <b>knuckle</b> <b>threads.</b> These are because of increase in strength and intensity of vortices ejected from the buttress threads. Subsequently an empirical correlation is also formulated to match with experimental results with ± 8 % and ± 9 %, variation respectively for Nusselt number and friction factor.
