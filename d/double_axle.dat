5000|$|For {{the figure}} skating term [...] "Double Axel", see Axel jump.Double Axle is a monster truck racing game created by Taito in 1991. The {{object of the}} game is to {{complete}} every single race by coming in 3rd Place or better. If the player fails to do so, the game will end. By completing races successfully, the player will be awarded prize money depending on how well they did. This game also features the option of upgrading the monster truck, which is essential for completing harder races. Additional money can be earned by completing the bonus stages after each race. The Japanese variant of <b>Double</b> <b>Axle</b> was as Power Wheels, featuring slightly modified gameplay.|$|E
50|$|As in {{a regular}} road vehicle, the tractor unit is steered through the front wheels by a {{steering}} wheel operated by a human driver, and powered by its rear single or <b>double</b> <b>axle.</b> The following carriages are then steered through the drawbar couplings between the carriages. Simple trains with few carriages or short in overall length may feature single- or double-axle carriages with just front-axle steering only. Larger or longer trains feature four-wheel steering by way of mechanical linkages. Four-wheel steering ensures that longer trains need less side clearance while turning, as the carriages are able to maintain the same path, describing a constant radius of arc. This adds to the impression of the vehicle being on rails. The drawbar connections of more complex trains may feature a shock absorber {{to mitigate the effect}} of acceleration or braking.|$|E
5000|$|In Japan, <b>Double</b> <b>Axle</b> {{was known}} as [...] "Power Wheels" [...] and the name for export release was ostensibly changed due to Kransco and their line of Power Wheels {{motorized}} toys for children. In this version, all the races ran on a 90-second countdown similar to most racing games at the time, and 60 seconds for the Car Crushing Contest. The objective in Power Wheels is to complete three laps around the selected course before time runs out. After every lap, extra time {{will be added to}} the clock. The game also pits you against a rival driver who will taunt you before the race begins, and vice versa if you pass him during the race. Power Wheels also gives the player three nitro boosters before every race, excluding the Car Crushing Contest, in which the player only gets one.|$|E
50|$|Kh (Х) was {{the class}} of <b>double</b> <b>axled</b> high-floor tramcars, which were built in Soviet Union in interbellum period. First {{vehicles}} were built in 1927 and delivered to Kharkov, Ukraine. First letter of city name, Cyrillic Х (usually transliterated as Kh), was selected as a designation of whole series. After Kharkiv, tramcars of this type were supplied to many Soviet cities and became most numerous in the fleets of many municipalities. In 1941, after the onset of Operation Barbarossa, their production was stopped for maximizing war efforts. The Kh-class tramcars were finally withdrawn from the city service in the mid-1960s as morally obsolete vehicles, their sturdy construction allowed them to be used much more. The small number of survived cars are preserved for museum purposes in Moscow, Nizhniy Novgorod, Saratov and few other cities.|$|R

50|$|MOWAG {{has built}} many {{different}} types of vehicles, such as ambulances, fire trucks (like the Mowag W300), dummy tanks, electric vehicles, scooters or tracked tanks. In the civilian sector, MOWAG has been particularly active in the construction of firefighting vehicles where several generations of emergency vehicles have been built on the Dodge pickups. Many models were based on factory designed firefighting trucks. In Germany, Mowag was well known for developing a four-wheel drive armored car, that was built under licence from Thyssen and Bussing / Henschel. In 1963, vehicles for the Federal Border Guard (Bundesgrenzschutz = BGS), MOWAG's production ran for decades. MOWAG had from the beginning {{to the end of the}} 1960s, built addition military vehicles and civilian trucks. Among them were the heavy trucks, MOWAG M5-16F with four seats, front steering cabin and 16 tons total weight, tow hitch for a <b>double</b> <b>axle</b> trailer and a 200-horsepower engine in the underfloor. The engine was mounted under the bed between the front and the rear axles. This allowed a compact design and low center of gravity in the middle of the vehicle.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe article {{presents}} {{a summary of}} several years (2009 - 2015) of studies on the application of mobile satellite Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) measurements {{in the field of}} designing and operation of railways. These studies have been conducted by an interdisciplinary research team from the Gdansk University of Technology and the Gdynia Maritime University. Mobile satellite GNSS measurements are taken during a ride (through the railroad) by the measuring train consist of motor car with a trailed <b>double</b> <b>axles</b> platform bogies on which the GNSS receivers were installed. The authors described the adopted methodology of the carried out measurements of the rail and tram tracks. The problem of an accuracy of satellite positioning measurements has been discussed. The authors proposed a method that makes it possible to assess quantitatively the accuracy of the research implemented over years. New concepts were introduced, such as: GNSS positioning networking service availability, reliability and continuity based on the theory of reliability. Using a developed mathematical model they recounted the results of four archival measurement campaigns of years: 2009 - 2015. The {{studies have shown that the}} number of used satellite systems as well as support for GNSS measurements with the inertial system are important from the point of view of the accuracy of the results...|$|R
40|$|A {{reinforced}} concrete pier structure, built in 1971, had evidently developed severe chloride-induced corrosion damage due to exposure to marine environment. Inspection conducted in 2006 revealed severe vertical cracking in the piles and extensive horizontal cracking and delamination {{of the cover}} concrete at the crosshead soffits. Previous ARRB data had shown that the 22 mm and 32 mm reinforcement bars had lost 1. 5 mm by 2000 due to chloride-induced corrosion. Based on the then prevailing corrosion rate, an additional 0. 4 mm was estimated to have been lost between 2000 and 2006. Several stirrups in the crossheads, under the wheel path, {{were found to be}} severely corroded or broken. The deck slabs and beams were far less affected by chloride-induced corrosion. The design load capacity of the pier was originally for 7 tonne (single axle) and 10 tonne (<b>double</b> <b>axle)</b> vehicles. Calculations based on the observed deterioration showed that the load rating of the piles, beams and deck slabs remain unchanged (despite the deterioration), but the crossheads were found to be severely deficient in shear capacity due to loss of stirrups. Based on the AS 5100 requirements, the load rating needed to be reduced to 3. 6 tonnes and 5. 2 tonnes for single and <b>double</b> <b>axle</b> vehicles, respectively. Costs for the remediation options, including cathodic protection, are estimated to be in the range of $ 4 - 5 M...|$|E
40|$|Now a days {{entire world}} depends upon {{automobile}}s. In an automobile motion {{is transferred from}} engine to rear wheel through various mechanical links. But differential gear box plays {{a vital role in}} the automobile for transferring motion from engine to rear axle. Normally single differential gear box is used for light weight vehicles but heavy load vehicles two or more rear axles with differential gear boxes are used for transferring maximum amount of power from engine to rear axles. So here it is focused on the mechanical design and analysis of <b>double</b> <b>axle</b> differential gear box as it transmits the power. This work develops a view to get familiar with the technologies as well as application of theories into practical work done by industries. My research contains the design with the help of CATIA/HYPER MESH and material selection of the <b>double</b> <b>axle</b> differential gearbox.
