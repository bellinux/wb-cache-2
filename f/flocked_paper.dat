50|$|An optical {{beam dump}} is an optical element used to absorb {{a beam of}} light. Major design {{concerns}} in a beam dump typically include the management and reduction of back reflections and scattering {{as well as the}} dissipation of heat generated by absorption. For low-power systems and less demanding applications, the device {{can be as simple as}} a piece of black velvet or <b>flock</b> <b>paper</b> glued onto a stiff backing, but higher-power beam dumps must often incorporate more elaborate features to avoid back-reflection, overheating, or excessive noise. Dumping the beam with a simple flat surface may scatter unacceptably large amounts of light for some applications, even though the direct reflection may be effectively reduced. To minimize scattering, it is common to use deep, dark cavities lined with an absorbing material to dump the beam. A particularly simple and relatively inexpensive approach is to use a stack of razor blades with the sharp edges facing the beam, so that the spaces between the blades form very deep cavities from which little light escapes.|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to test the hypothesis that chicks with access to litter during the first five weeks of life would be less fearful as adult hens compared to birds reared without access to litter. The hypothesis was tested in a national on-farm study in commercial aviary flocks in Norway. Five rearing farmers divided the pullets into two groups within their rearing houses. While the chicks were enclosed inside the aviary rows during the first five weeks of life, paper substrate where food and other particles could accumulate, covered the wire mesh floor in the treatment group, whereas the control group was reared on bare wire mesh. At 30 weeks of age, 23 aviary flocks (11 control <b>flocks</b> reared without <b>paper</b> and 12 treatment <b>flocks</b> reared with <b>paper)</b> were visited. During the visit, the fearfulness of the adult birds was tested in a stationary person test and a novel object test. The data was analysed by ANOVA or logistic regression as appropriate. The access to litter during rearing did not influence the number of birds that approached within 25. cm of the stationary person (p = 0. 51). All flocks, regardless of rearing treatment, had birds which came within 2. m of the stationary person. The latency to approach within 2. m of the stationary person tended to be influenced by provision of environmental enrichment as adults (p = 0. 08) and by the interaction between treatment. ×. rearing farm (p = 0. 08). The number of birds that approached within 2. m of the stationary person was influenced by the interaction between treatment during rearing and provision of enrichment as adults (p = 0. 03), however, the post hoc test showed no pairwise differences. All flocks, regardless of rearing treatment, had birds that approached the novel object. The access to litter during rearing did not influence the birds' latency to approach the novel object. The number of birds approaching the novel object was affected by the interaction between access to substrate during rearing and provision of environmental enrichment as adults (p = 0. 05).

Small, lightweight, low speed and agile UAVs, such as multirotors platforms can incorporate many kinds of sensors that are suitable for detecting object of interests in cluttered outdoor areas.

Experiment 1 examined the weight change of Merino wethers allowed access to either lupin grain or whole cottonseed 0, 1, 2 or 7 days/week for 6 weeks. Experiment 2 examined the weight change of Merino wethers allowed access to either lupins or a sorghum + cottonseed meal (CSM) supplement 0, 2, 4 or 7 days/week for 8 weeks. Experiment 3 investigated {{the relationship between}} five allocations of trough space at the supplement self-feeders (5 – 50 cm/sheep) and the weight change of Merino wethers allowed access to lupins 1 day/week for 8 weeks. In all experiments, the Merino wethers had free access as a single group to drinking water and low quality hay in a large group pen and were allowed access to supplement once per day on their scheduled days of access. No water was available in the areas containing supplement, but one-way flow gates allowed animals {{to return to the}} group pen in their own time. There was a linear response in growth rate to increased frequency of access to lupins in Experiments 1 and 2, with each additional day of access increasing liveweight gain by 26 and 21 g/day, respectively. Similarly, the response to the sorghum + CSM supplement was linear, although significantly lower (P < 0. 05), at 12 g/day. Providing access to whole cottonseed resulted in no significant change in growth rate compared with the control animals. In Experiment 3, decreasing trough space from 50 to 5 cm/sheep had no effect on sheep liveweight change. It was concluded that the relationships developed here, for growth response to increased frequency of access to lupins or a sorghum + CSM supplement, could be used to indicate the most appropriate frequency of access to supplement, through a remote drafting unit, to achieve sheep weight change targets.

40|$|Beckett’s {{statement}} is a perplexing one, and serves, in part, {{as a warning}} to the reader and the critic not to get too carried away in their interpretation of symbols, which may well not be intended as symbols. At the same time there is a comic element to this cautionary note, for how can the reader possibly know what was intended as a symbol and what wasn’t. Beckett often brings sheep into his work, and sheep are redolent with symbolism, in religion, in mythology, in astrology, in the arts: literature, poetry, music and drama, and in popular culture. Whether the symbolic significance of sheep in Beckett is intended or not, it is hard to escape from their cultural associations which are so strongly embedded in the mind of a reader. People are commonly referred to as sheep in a negative way, when they are considered as easily led and not very clever. On the other hand the epithet ‘black sheep’ suggests an outsider: a person who has chosen to act {{in a way that does}} not fit in with herd. This, however, is also used in a negative way to suggest a person who has gone to the bad. Intriguingly, sheep are not stupid, and it has been discovered that sheep can recognize individual human faces, and the faces of other sheep, and remember them, and even recognize emotions in faces, both of humans and sheep. Beckett was of course well aware of the cultural associations sheep have acquired. In many early religions sheep, especially rams, are linked to the gods; in many religions, even to this day, they are ritually sacrificed. The Christian religion uses sheep and shepherd symbolism in varied and at times conflicting ways: sheep are sacrificial victims, members of the ‘flock’ who follow Christian teachings faithfully, and Christ is the ‘Lamb’ or ‘Good Shepherd’ who guards his <b>flock.</b> The <b>paper</b> will be exploring the presence of sheep in Beckett’s work, and will be making some suggestions as to their significance, symbolic or otherwise, considering how they can be seen to be versatile and shifting, working both with and against cultural associations. <br/...|$|R
40|$|In {{the field}} of {{molecular}} simulations, the long-standing aim has been to study mechanisms that cannot easily be observed in experiments or {{understood in terms of}} more abstract models. This is hard for systems of mesoscopic size (proteins, membranes etc.) as the time and length scales on which important phenomena take place are often far beyond what is feasible to simulate using an atomistic level of detail. To overcome this issue, several different coarse graining schemes have been developed, resulting in effective dynamics evolving on larger length and time scales than the fully detailed microscopic systems. A simulation technique that has received increasing interest in the last decade is Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD), but despite its popularity, the physical interpretation of DPD is not complete. In particular, no strict explanation has been given concerning the connection between the mesoscopic DPD technique and the microscopic systems from which the mesoscopic dynamics originates. This thesis establishes the link between the DPD-representation of a system, and the same system on a fine-grained (microscopic) level. This is achieved by adapting the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics technique of Mori-Zwanzig projections to many-particle systems (Papers I, III), giving a formal footing on which the DPD technique can stand. The theory is also explicitly tested using computer simulations in Paper IV. In that paper, a molecular dynamics simulation of water (using water molecules with one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms) and a DPD representation of the same system with mass-center approximation of the water molecules are compared. The results are compared and contrasted to a DPD-model with parameters manually tuned to give correct transport properties (presented in Paper II). For particle-based coarse-graining of fluids, the particles are often identified with clusters of fluid molecules. In Paper V, the bearings of this view on equilibrium and transport properties of the coarse-grained fluid are investigated. It is shown for the case of coarse-graining through Voronoi tessellation that this representation cannot capture the properties of the microscopic system. Papers VI and VII concern the use of methods from coarse-grained molecular simulations for estimating interactions between flocking animals. In particular, paper VI shows how a force-matching method can be used to faithfully recreate all interactions in a simulated bird <b>flock,</b> and <b>paper</b> VII contains a comment stating that interaction rules used by flocking animals can most likely not be deduced from static photographs...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{quantitative}} continuum theory of "flocking": the collective coherent motion {{of large numbers}} of self-propelled organisms. Our model predicts the existence of an "ordered phase" of flocks, in which all members of the flock move together with the same mean velocity. This coherent motion of the flock is an example of spontaneously broken symmetry. The "Goldstone modes" associated with this "spontaneously broken rotational symmetry" are fluctuations in the direction of motion of {{a large part of the}} flock away from the mean direction. These "Goldstone modes" mix with modes associated with conservation of bird number to produce propagating sound modes. These sound modes lead to enormous fluctuations of the density of the flock. Our model is similar in many ways to the Navier-Stokes equations for a simple compressible fluid; in other ways, it resembles a relaxational time dependent Ginsburg-Landau theory for an n = d component isotropic ferromagnet. In spatial dimensions d > 4, the long distance behavior is correctly described by a linearized theory. For d < 4, non-linear fluctuation effects radically alter the long distance behavior, making it different from that of any known equilibrium model. In particular, we find that in d = 2, where we can calculate the scaling exponents exactly, flocks exhibit a true, long-range ordered, spontaneously broken symmetry state, in contrast to equilibrium systems, which cannot spontaneously break a continuous symmetry in d = 2 (the "Mermin-Wagner" theorem). We make detailed predictions for various correlation functions that could be measured either in simulations, or by quantitative imaging of real <b>flocks.</b> Comment: Long <b>paper</b> on <b>flocking</b> with 11 figure...|$|R

Sponsorship: DEFRAFrom April 2005, member states of the European Union were required to implement a compulsory breeding programme for resistance to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) in sheep as part of measures to eradicate TSEs from national <b>flocks.</b> In this <b>paper,</b> we assessed the impact of four different breeding strategies on prion protein (PrP) genotype frequencies using a mathematical model which describes in detail gene flow in the British sheep flock. These strategies ranged from the minimum requirements laid down in by EU legislation to compulsory implementation of the current National Scrapie Plan for Great Britain (NSP) ram genotyping scheme. All four strategies were predicted to substantially reduce {{the frequency of the}} VRQ allele, which is associated with the highest risk of scrapie, although schemes with more stringent requirements produced a larger reduction. However, there were marked differences in the impact of the strategies on the frequency of other PrP alleles. In particular, restrictions beyond those required by EU legislation were necessary to change the frequency of other PrP alleles substantially. Consequently, a breeding programme which aims to reduce the risk to human health by reducing the frequency of the ARQ allele (associated with the highest risk of BSE in sheep) must place restrictions on ARQ-bearing animals. Similarly, a programme which seeks to increase the frequency of the ARR allele (associated with the lowest risk of TSE) must favour ARR-bearing animals. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} work we introduced an anonymising proxy scheme — called Flocks — {{to be used}} for browsing privacy. Flocks is similar to Crowds in that each proxy randomly decides whether to forward any request it receives to the destination Web server, or whether to forward the request to another proxy. In this manner request chains are formed that hide the details of an originator of a request from the destination server {{as well as from the}} various proxies. Flocks differs from Crowds (and similar Privacy-enhancing Technologies or PETs) because it caches pages that are requested. Unlike related PETs, Flocks is intended for deployment within an organisation. Caching minimises the need for communication between an organisation and external content providers, decreasing cost and potentially increasing access speed. Logging in Flocks is designed to balance privacy with the need to conduct forensic investigations when required (with safeguards to prevent unauthorised breaches of privacy). Two parameters determine the behaviour of Flocks: α is the probability with which any proxy will forward a request to an external server (rather than to another proxy) and N is the number of proxies in the system. In {{previous work}} we analytically determined the impact of these two parameters on privacy and performance aspects of <b>Flocks.</b> The current <b>paper</b> reports on simulations that were performed to gain deeper insight into the behaviour of Flocks. The simulations confirm the analytic results of our previous work. They also shed light on performance-related issues such as the number and positions of access to external servers, saturation levels and traffic patterns. This information will be useful to decide on appropriate values of α and N from a performance point of view. The simulations also highlight the problem of overly long chains that will occasionally occur. A simple solution is proposed and tested empirically...|$|R
