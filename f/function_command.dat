40|$|The {{intent of}} this study was to improve {{residential}} energy efficiency in Texas by developing an improved tool for home builders and code officers to use for evaluating their designs. It was achieved by developing a new ground-coupled heat pump (GCHP) model for residential systems to be used with the DOE- 2. 1 e simulation program. To accomplish this, this study investigated closed-loop ground heat exchanger (GHX) models, including horizontal, surface water, and vertical GHX models. This study selected a case-study house in Texas which has a custom-built GHX using a combination of a horizontal GHX and a surface water GHX. This study developed a custom-built GHX model for the case-study house to calculate the entering water temperatures (EWTs). The custom-built GHX model was then validated using the measured EWT data from the case-study house. The results showed the monthly average EWTs differences between the measured and calculated EWTs were observed to be about 2. 2 F during the heating season and about 3. 2 F during the cooling season. Therefore, this study concluded the slightly over-estimated EWTs were acceptable considering the other uncertainties of the field conditions. In addition, a vertical GHX DOE- 2. 1 e model was developed by using the DOE- 2. 1 e <b>FUNCTION</b> <b>command.</b> The g-function values approximated in this study was used for the vertical GHX DOE- 2. 1 e model. To develop a new DOE- 2. 1 e GCHP simulation model, this study then incorporated the vertical GHX DOE- 2. 1 e input FUNCTION within an air-source heat pump (ASHP) simulation module by modifying existing DOE- 2 calculation algorithms. To evaluate the new DOE- 2. 1 e GCHP model, this study also developed simplified residential ASHP/GCHP base-case models for Houston and Dallas, using DOE- 2. 1 e, eQUEST, IC 3, REM/Rate, and EnergyGauge. The DOE- 2. 1 e simulation results were then compared against the other programs to verify the accuracy of the new DOE- 2. 1 e GCHP model. The comparison showed good agreement in the total site energy use within 3. 3 MMBtu/yr (5. 3 %) differences. In addition, the simulation results showed the GCHP system benefits: for the total site energy savings, 9. 7 % in Houston and 13. 1 % in Dallas, and for the heating plus cooling energy savings, 27. 3 % in Houston and 35. 3 % in Dallas...|$|E
