5|$|Blood {{and urine}} samples {{indicated}} {{that she had}} taken the anti-psychotic drug haloperidol, and several days earlier had used cannabis. There were no marks on her body suggestive of a struggle. The firearms officer who first saw her said her feet and hands were clean, her fingernails manicured and not broken, and her fingertips free of blood, dirt or powder. There was no trace of lead dust. The rifle magazine would have been loaded at least twice during the killings; this would usually leave lubricant and material from the bullets on the hands. A scenes-of-crimes officer, DC Hammersley, said there were bloodstains {{on the back of}} her right hand, but that otherwise <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> clean.|$|E

500|$|Capper had not died {{immediately}} as her murderers believed, {{and after}} they left she managed to scramble back up the embankment and stagger along the lane for approximately {{a quarter of a}} mile (400 m) to Compstall Road before being found at 06:10 by Barry Sutcliffe and two of his colleagues on their way to work. She told them: [...] "Over there, in the field. They burnt me, they put petrol on me." [...] They immediately took her to a nearby house and roused the residents, Michael and Margaret Coop, to call for an ambulance. Michael Coop said: [...] "Both her hands appeared like ash. Her legs were just like raw meat and her feet appeared to be badly charred. I was struck by how polite the victim was. She was constantly thanking my wife for her assistance." [...] Margaret Coop said: [...] "I instinctively went to put my arms around her but she pulled away because she could not bear to be touched. Her head was shaved and there were recent, not new, cuts to her head. Her face was almost featureless. <b>Her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> red raw and black at the fingertips. Her legs were red from top to bottom. She couldn't bear anything near her legs." [...] Capper drank six glasses of water, but was unable to hold the glass herself because of the injuries to her hands. Margaret Coop said: [...] "She looked like the victim of an attack in the Vietnam war. But I felt she would survive. I had this theory that, now she had got to somewhere she could be helped, she would live." [...] Capper was rushed to the hospital and was able to give the names of her six assailants and Powell's address before falling into a coma. The extent of her burns was such that her mother and stepfather were unable to recognise her, and she was positively identified by a partial fingerprint from her thumb, the only part of her hands not severely burned. She died on 18 December 1992, without regaining consciousness.|$|E

2500|$|John Farrar was {{the captain}} of the Edgartown Fire Rescue unit and diver who {{recovered}} Kopechne's body. He alleged that Kopechne died from suffocation rather than from drowning or from the impact of the overturned vehicle. This hypothesis was based upon the posture in which he found the body and the body's relative position to the area of an ultimate air pocket in the overturned vehicle. Farrar also asserted that Kopechne would have likely survived if a more timely rescue attempt had been conducted. Farrar located Kopechne's body in the well of the backseat of the overturned submerged car. Rigor mortis was apparent, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> clasping the backseat, and her face was turned upward. Farrar testified at the Inquest: ...|$|E

2500|$|On May 28, 1981, at {{approximately}} 2:15am, Fred Schultz's ex-wife Christine {{was murdered in}} her Milwaukee home. Christine Schultz {{had been killed by}} a single [...]38 caliber pistol shot fired point-blank into her back and through her heart. She had been gagged and blindfolded and <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> tied in front of her with rope. Her two sons, then 7 and 11 years old, found her face down on her bed and bleeding. The older boy, Sean, had seen the assailant and described him as a masked male figure in a green army jacket and black shoes. He also said the man had a long (approx. 6" [...] or 15cm) reddish-colored ponytail. Bembenek had dyed blonde hair, weighed 140 pounds and was [...]|$|E
2500|$|She {{was young}} and tall of stature, clad in a garment of deep blue, ... Her dress was covered with {{brilliant}} gold stars. The sleeves were ample and long. She wore slippers of the same blue as the dress, ornamented with gold bows. On the head was a black veil half covering the forehead, concealing the hair and ears, and falling over the shoulders. Above this was a crown resembling a diadem, higher in front than elsewhere, and widening out at the sides. A red line encircled the crown at the middle. <b>Her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> small and extended toward us as in the 'miraculous medal.' Her face had the most exquisite delicacy and a smile of ineffable sweetness. The eyes, of unutterable tenderness, were fixed on us. Like a true mother, she seemed happier in looking at us than we in contemplating.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{have also}} said it is {{detrimental}} to the presumption of innocence. [...] "It's {{a way for the}} police to try their case in the press and to get the intimation of guilt by virtue of an arrest," [...] says New York Civil Liberties Union director Donna Lieberman. [...] "The question is, does it poison the right to a fair trial? And that depends on each case." [...] Nat Hentoff of the Village Voice observed that [...] "nder such circumstances, even Mother Teresa would look extremely suspicious, especially if <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> cuffed behind her back." [...] Acknowledging a common response to such criticisms, that no arrested defendant is spared the perp walk, law professor Patricia Williams says [...] "the perp walk is a social equalizer all right, but not in a good way" [...] since the United States leads the world in incarceration rates. [...] " [...] is hardly the greatest icon of equal rights".|$|E

2500|$|One long-standing {{mystery of}} the {{painting}} is why Mona Lisa features very faint eyebrows and apparently {{does not have any}} eyelashes. In October 2007, Pascal Cotte, a French engineer and inventor, says he discovered with a high-definition camera that Leonardo da Vinci originally did paint eyebrows and eyelashes. Creating an ultra-high resolution close-up that magnified Mona Lisas face 24 times, Cotte says he found a single brushstroke of a single hair above the left eye. [...] "One day I say, if I can find only one hair, only one hair of the eyebrow, I will have definitively the proof that originally Leonardo da Vinci had painted eyelash and eyebrow," [...] said Cotte. The engineer claims that other eyebrow hairs that potentially could have appeared on the painting may have faded or been inadvertently erased by a poor attempt to clean the painting. In addition, Cotte says his work uncovered proof that <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> originally painted in a slightly different position than in the final portrait.|$|E
2500|$|Edging {{closer and}} without {{reference}} {{points in the}} whiteout they realised they had got very close to a person {{on their hands and}} knees – Davidson was still up on the plateau trying to crawl for help. [...] away, the closest they could manage, two crew were unloaded but after they had reached the casualty they could not carry her to the helicopter because her legs were locked in a kneeling position. The helicopter could get no closer because when it applied power the blowing snow obliterated vision so one of the crew jumped out to lead it in the right direction using the winch wire. There was no sign of anyone else from Davidson's group. Davidson was taken by helicopter to Aviemore where she was met by ambulance. She was in the advanced stages of hypothermia and <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> frozen solid but, although she was confused and barely able to speak, she managed to let her rescuers know {{that the rest of the}} party was close to where she had been rescued.|$|E
2500|$|When Atwell {{first came}} to Britain, she {{initially}} earned only a few pounds a week. By the mid-1950s, this had shot up to over $10,000. By 1952, her popularity had spread internationally. <b>Her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>were</b> insured with Lloyd's of London for £40,000 (the policy stipulating that she was never to wash dishes). She signed a record contract with Decca, and her sales were soon 30,000 discs a week. She {{was by far the}} biggest selling pianist of her time. Her 1954 hit [...] "Let's Have Another Party" [...] was the first piano instrumental to reach number one in the UK Singles Chart. She is the only holder of two gold and two silver discs for piano music in Britain, and was the first black artist in the UK to sell a million records. Millions of copies of her sheet music were sold, and she went on to record her best-known hits, including [...] "Let's Have a Party", [...] "Flirtation Waltz", [...] "Poor People of Paris" [...] (which reached number one in the UK Singles Chart in 1956), [...] "Britannia Rag" [...] and [...] "Jubilee Rag". Her signature [...] "Black and White Rag" [...] became famous again in the 1970s as the theme of the BBC snooker programme Pot Black, which also enjoyed great popularity in Australia when screened on the ABC network. It was during this period that she discovered Matt Monro and persuaded Decca to sign him.|$|E
