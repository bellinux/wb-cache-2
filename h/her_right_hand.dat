5|$|As Marge {{prepares to}} leave Vancouver, she reveals to Homer {{that she is}} left-handed, but has always used <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> to avoid seeming unusual (due to years of using <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand,</b> it renders her cross-dominant). She has enough dexterity to change Maggie's diaper and dress her one-handed. They return to the rink {{just in time to}} stop Seymour from {{forfeiting}} the match and go on to defeat Sweden for the gold. Agnes softens her attitude of unyielding contempt toward her son after he breaks his broom and has to drop out, and Marge and Homer agree that they had a great date night.|$|E
5|$|By {{the age of}} 76, Moses had {{developed}} arthritis, which made embroidery painful. Her sister Celestia suggested that painting would be easier for her, and this idea spurred Moses's painting career in her late 70s. When <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> began to hurt, she switched to her left hand.|$|E
5|$|While Queen Maya {{felt that}} it was the time to give birth, she went to the Lumbini park outside the Kapilavastu city. She stood under a plaksa tree, holding one branch with <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand,</b> and she gave birth to a son, Prince Siddhartha. The story on the panels {{continues}} until the prince becomes the Buddha.|$|E
50|$|Iconography: Goddess Katyayani {{rides on}} a {{magnificent}} lion and is depicted with four hands. She carries a lotus flower and sword {{in her left}} hands respectively and keeps <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hands</b> in Abhayamudra and Varadamudras.|$|R
50|$|Iconography: She {{rides the}} bull, just like Goddess Shailputri. She has four arms, holding a Trishul {{in one of}} <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hands</b> and depicts the Abhayamudra with the other <b>right</b> <b>hand.</b> She carries a Damaru in one left hand and depicts the Varadamudra in her other left hand.|$|R
50|$|Iconography: Her {{complexion}} is dark {{black and}} She rides on a donkey. She is depicted with four <b>hands.</b> <b>Her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hands</b> are in Abhayamudra and Varadamudra. She carries a sword and deadly iron hook {{in her left}} hands.|$|R
5|$|Blood {{and urine}} samples {{indicated}} {{that she had}} taken the anti-psychotic drug haloperidol, and several days earlier had used cannabis. There were no marks on her body suggestive of a struggle. The firearms officer who first saw her said her feet and hands were clean, her fingernails manicured and not broken, and her fingertips free of blood, dirt or powder. There was no trace of lead dust. The rifle magazine would have been loaded at least twice during the killings; this would usually leave lubricant and material from the bullets on the hands. A scenes-of-crimes officer, DC Hammersley, said there were bloodstains {{on the back of}} <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand,</b> but that otherwise her hands were clean.|$|E
5|$|Empress Shulü Ping, {{who became}} known as Empress Dowager Yingtian {{following}} the death of her husband, was an exceptionally powerful figure both before and after Taizu's death. While the latter was alive, Shulü Ping commanded an army of 200,000 horsemen that was tasked with maintaining order while Taizu led military campaigns abroad. She also led campaigns herself. Following the death of her husband, the Empress rejected the traditional Khitan custom of being buried with him, and elected to cut off <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> and bury that with the Emperor instead. Shulü Ping then seized full military and civil authority in order to oversee the imperial succession under her own terms. The Empress's refusal to kill herself and be buried with Taizu effectively ended the longstanding custom.|$|E
5|$|Nicholas Sander, a Catholic recusant born c. 1530, was {{committed}} to deposing Elizabeth I and re-establishing Catholicism in England. In his De Origine ac Progressu schismatis Anglicani (The Rise and Growth of the Anglican Schism), published in 1585, {{he was the first}} to write that Anne had six fingers on <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand.</b> Since physical deformities were generally interpreted as a sign of evil, it is unlikely that Anne Boleyn would have gained Henry's romantic attention had she had any. Upon exhumation in 1876, no abnormalities were discovered. Her frame was described as delicate, approximately 5'3", with finely formed, tapering fingers.|$|E
50|$|Iconography: Rides on a lioness and {{has eight}} hands. She holds a kamandalu, Dhanush, Bada and Kamal in <b>Her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hands.</b> <b>Her</b> left hands hold Amrit Kalash(pot of nectar), japa mala(prayer beads), Gada and Chakra - in that order.|$|R
60|$|She {{gave him}} <b>her</b> {{sympathetic}} <b>right</b> <b>hand,</b> in perfect rapture with his proposal, and eagerly and gratefully thanked him.|$|R
50|$|Iconography: Goddess Skandamata mounts {{the ferocious}} lion. She carries baby Skanda in her lap. Lord Skanda(also known as Kartikeya or Lord Murugan) is {{the brother of}} Ganesha. Goddess Skandamata is {{depicted}} with four hands. She carries lotus flowers in Her upper two hands. She holds baby Skanda in one of <b>Her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hands</b> and keeps the other <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> in Abhayamudra. She sits on a lotus flower and because of that, {{is also known as}} Goddess Padmasana.|$|R
5|$|The goddess {{carries her}} own severed head– {{sometimes}} {{on a platter}} or in a skull-bowl– in her left hand. Though no legend mentions a specific weapon for the beheading, she holds a scimitar, a knife or a scissor-like object in <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand.</b> Though generally depicted with two arms, manifestations of the goddess with four arms also exist. While her own severed head and the sword appear in two of her hands, the implements in the remaining arms vary: a scissor-like object, a skull-bowl collecting the dripping blood from her head or blood stream from her neck, or a severed head, sometimes identified {{as that of the}} god Brahma.|$|E
5|$|Harris {{signed with}} the University of North Carolina Tar Heels to play for head coach Anson Dorrance. Due to {{national}} team commitments for the FIFA U-19 Women's World Cup in Thailand {{in the fall of}} 2004, Harris delayed her enrollment and did not start training with the Tar Heels until the spring of 2005. During one spring practice, a ball caught <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> as she was warming up and shattered her thumb. After a surgery that inserted three pins in her thumb, she was put on the bench until the summer. At her first practice back with the Tar Heels in the summer of 2005, Harris tore her right anterior cruciate ligament, which kept her out for the entire 2005 season. Despite being hurt, Harris still made the 2006 Atlantic Coast Conference Academic Honor Roll team.|$|E
5|$|India's first {{records of}} {{smallpox}} {{can be found}} in a medical book that dates back to A.D. 400. This book describes a disease that sounds exceptionally like smallpox. India, like China, created a goddess in response to its exposure to smallpox. The Hindu goddess Shitala was both worshipped and feared during her reign. It was believed that this goddess was both evil and kind and had the ability to inflict victims when angered, as well as calm the fevers of the already afflicted. Portraits of the goddess show her holding a broom in <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> to continue to move the disease and a pot of cool water in the other hand in an attempt to soothe victims. Shrines were created where many India natives, both healthy and not, went to worship and attempt to protect themselves from this disease. Some Indian women, in an attempt to ward off Shitala, placed plates of cooling foods and pots of water on the roofs of their homes.|$|E

50|$|Mangala Temple was {{constructed}} in the 19th century CE and is located in Village Patia in Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha. The enshrined deity is the four-armed Mangala. The deity holds a conch in <b>her</b> upper <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> and a wheel in her lower left hand. The upper left hand of the deity assumes the varadamudra, while <b>her</b> lower <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> assumes the abhayamudra. The deity stands on a pedestal. The temple {{is located in the}} Harijan sahi (a residential ward restricted to Harijans) of Patia, whose residents maintain it.|$|R
5|$|The central {{feature of}} the {{monument}} depicts the theme {{of a young man}} called from civil life to serve his nation in a time of need and it transforms the theme into a contemporary allegory. It captures the decisive moment as farmer is caught mid-transition, with his left hand still on the plow handle, and taking the sword with his right hand from Liberty. The details of the farmer includes realistic work clothes, a yoked shirt with rolled sleeves and work trousers tucked into his boots. Liberty, identified by her Phrygian cap, stands just above the farmer in classical robes with a breastplate, sandals and cloak. Her face is impassive as she bestows the sword upon the farmer with her left hand while <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> holds her pike.|$|E
5|$|A statue by {{sculptor}} Daniel Chester French called Alma Mater {{is centered}} {{on the front steps}} of Low Memorial Library. McKim, Mead & White invited French to build the sculpture in order to harmonize with the larger composition of the court and library {{in the center of the}} campus. Draped in an academic gown, the female figure of Alma Mater wears a crown of laurels and sits on a throne. The scroll-like arms of the throne end in lamps, representing sapientia and doctrina. A book signifying knowledge, balances on her lap, and an owl, the attribute of wisdom, is hidden in the folds of her gown. <b>Her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> holds a scepter composed of four sprays of wheat, terminating with a crown of King's College which refers to Columbia's origin as a Royalist institution in 1754. A local actress named Mary Lawton was said to have posed for parts of the sculpture. The statue was dedicated on September 23, 1903, as a gift of Mr. & Mrs. Robert Goelet, and was originally covered in golden leaf. During the Columbia University protests of 1968 a bomb damaged the sculpture, but it has since been repaired. The small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many Columbia legends, the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian, and that any subsequent Columbia male who finds it will marry a Barnard student, given that Barnard is a women's college.|$|E
5|$|Whilst wool {{remained}} {{an important part}} of the town's economy into the 19th (and even 20th) centuries, other industries were established in the town. A bell-foundry started in 1684 by William Cockey grew to be a major producer of components for the developing gas industry and employer of 800 people. The J W Singer brass foundry and bronze-casting works, was a major employer and produced bronze statues. John Webb Singer was born in Frome and established his art metal work foundry in 1851. They made brass ornaments for local churches and became known through the Oxford Movement within the Church of England which led to increasing demand for church ornaments. In addition to church ornaments the firm developed the facilities and expertise to create large statues. One of the first statues cast was a copy of General Gordon riding a camel. The firm was also responsible for the bronze statue of Boudica with her daughters in her war chariot (furnished with scythes after the Persian fashion), which was commissioned by Prince Albert and executed by Thomas Thornycroft. It was not cast in bronze until 1902, 17 years after Thornycrofts death, and now stands next to Westminster Bridge and the Houses of Parliament, London. The statue of Lady Justice on the dome above the Old Bailey was executed by the British sculptor, F. W. Pomeroy and cast by Singers. She holds a sword in <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> and a pair of weighing scales in her left. The statue is popularly supposed to show blind Justice; however, the figure is not blindfolded. The statue of Alfred the Great at Winchester was a further commission. The statues from Singers have also been exported around the world. Printing was another major industry, with the Butler and Tanner printworks being set up in the middle of the century. Brewing was also a source of employment.|$|E

500|$|The temple {{contains}} the earliest {{representation of a}} six-armed Mahishamardini (Durga) image, shown inside a gavaksha frame from the chest upward with a headdress, karna kundala (ornament), mala (garland) and kankana (anklet). Durga is seen holding a sword in the upper left hand while in the upper <b>right</b> <b>hand,</b> she is seen pressing {{the face of the}} demon buffalo. In her left middle hand, she is seen piercing the neck of the demon with a trishula (trident), while in her lower left hand she holds a pointed weapon. In <b>her</b> <b>right</b> middle <b>hand</b> she holds Khetaka while in <b>her</b> lower <b>right</b> <b>hand</b> she holds a bow. A similar image of Durga is found in the Vaital temple, which is a famous Shakta center.|$|R
50|$|Mysterious girl {{assigned}} to the Team Leviathan. Receives preferential treatment in UCAT Japan and those who know her true story are very few, like Ooshiro Kazuo. She has lost her memory, so she does not remember where she came from or her own parents, so she joins the Leviathan Road to find information about her past. However, the clues are very scarce as besides her name, she only has a men's ring in <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand's</b> middle finger {{and the memory of}} the Silent Night song.|$|R
5|$|The Devi Bhagavata Purana narrates {{that when}} Kali (Satyavati) was {{ferrying}} the rishi (sage) Parashara {{across the river}} Yamuna, the sage wanted Kali to satisfy his lust and held <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand.</b> She tried to dissuade Parashara, saying that a learned Brahmin of his stature should not desire a woman who stinks of fish. She finally gave in, realizing the desperation and persistence of the sage and fearing {{that if she did}} not heed to his request, he might topple the boat midstream. Kali agreed, and told Parashara to be patient until the boat reached the bank. On reaching the other side the sage grabbed her again, but she declared that her body stank and coitus should be delightful to them both. At these words, Matsyagandha was transformed (by the powers of the sage) into Yojanagandha ("she whose fragrance can be smelled from across a yojana"). She now smelled of musk, and so was called Kasturi-gandhi ("musk-fragrant"). When Parashara, tormented with desire, approached her again she insisted that the act was not appropriate in broad daylight, as her father and others would see them in sex from the other bank; they should wait till night. The sage, with his powers, shrouded the entire area in fog. Before Parashara could enjoy her, Satyavati again interrupted him to say that he would enjoy her and depart, robbing her of her virginity and leaving her shamed in society. The sage then blessed her with virgo intacta. She asked Parashara to promise her that the coitus would be a secret and her virginity intact; the son born from their union would be as famous as the great sage; and her fragrance and youth would be eternal. Parashara granted her these wishes and was satiated by the beautiful Satyavati. After the act, the sage bathed in the river and left, never to meet her again. The Mahabharata abridges the story, noting only two wishes for Satyavati: her virgo intacta and everlasting sweet fragrance.|$|E
25|$|Cassiopeia {{has been}} {{variously}} portrayed throughout her {{history as a}} constellation. In Persia, she was drawn by al-Sufi as a queen holding a staff with a crescent moon in <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand,</b> wearing a crown, {{as well as a}} two-humped camel. In France, she was portrayed as having a marble throne and a palm leaf in her left hand, holding her robe in <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hand.</b> This depiction is from Augustin Royer's 1679 atlas.|$|E

60|$|When I {{said some}} reassuring words, she {{stretched}} out <b>her</b> tremulous <b>right</b> <b>hand,</b> {{as though she}} was going to touch me; but she recalled it again before I understood the action, or knew how to receive it.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{they reached}} the temple, a single room, {{surrounded}} by a spacious paved area; in front was an immense building capable of seating hundreds of people. Before the image there were pools of blood, where victims had lately been slaughtered. In the sanctum was Devi, a large black figure with ten arms. With a spear in one of <b>her</b> <b>right</b> <b>hands</b> she pierced the giant Mahisha; and {{with one of her}} left hands she held the tail of a serpent, and the hair of the giant, whose breast the serpent was biting. Her other arms were all raised above her head, and were filled with different instruments of war; against <b>her</b> <b>right</b> leg leaned a lion.|$|R
