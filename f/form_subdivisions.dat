40|$|Critics {{have offered}} many {{views about the}} {{structure}} of Piers Plowman. Provided with few clues, {{they have tried to}} determine from the dominant features the poem's organizing factors. However, since 1926, when G. R. Owst suggested in Preaching in Medieval England that the meaning of Piers would become clear if the poem were compared in its thematic and artistic elements with sermon literature (295 - 296), only a few critics have discussed Langland's use of the sermon form. This present study argues that Langland structured his poem as a sermon to answer the Dreamer's question, "How I may saue my soule?" (B. I. 84), and to explain that salvation is attained by knowing and observing the love commandments, a Scriptural theme frequently treated in the sermons of the time. By comparing the structure of Piers with that of the sermon as Robert of Basevorn describes in Forma praedicandi (1322), I show that Langland forms his poem with the use of sermon "ornaments": invention of theme, antetheme/protheme, prayer concluding the antetheme, restatement of theme, division and confirmation of divisions, and concluding prayer. In addition, I show that the visions and passus, which are interrupted with the Dreamer's awakening, <b>form</b> <b>subdivisions</b> in each of the sections. I also show that Langland uses dream-allegory, dramatic-narrative, and satirical exempla to embellish his explanation of salvation. This parallel of the "art" in Langland's poem with the "art" of preaching shows that the poem has a definite structural and thematic unity and that the logical plan makes Christian belief concerning salvation understandable, instructive, and persuasive...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} an {{analysis}} of the quality of Machine Readable Cataloging (MARC) Records of children 2 ̆ 7 s picture books and easy readers in terms of accuracy and completeness of information. It was a case study which was based on the books in the Educational Media Collection (EMC) at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh. The purpose was to determine to what extent there were elements of the MARC record as provided in The Guidelines for Standardized Cataloging of Children 2 ̆ 7 s Materials, referred to as The Guidelines, which were missing and/or incorrect in records retrieved from the OCLC utility. The catalogers at the Library of Congress are required to use these guidelines when cataloging children 2 ̆ 7 s materials. There were 3, 098 records used in this study; 2, 363 records were submitted to the OCLC database by the catalogers at the Library of Congress and 735 were submitted by the catalogers at OCLC Participating Libraries. Six guidelines were relevant to picture books and easy readers: placing the 2 ̆ 2 j 2 ̆ 2 code in the Target Audience Field, entering the elements of the record following the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules 2 nd ed. 1988 Revision (AACR 2 R 88) Level 2 description, including summary notes, providing the International Standard Book Number (ISBN), providing added entries for joint authors and illustrators and identifying the illustrators, and providing subject headings without juvenile <b>form</b> <b>subdivisions.</b> There were 9, 849 errors which appeared on 3, 098 records. This was an average of 2. 5 errors per record cataloged at the Library of Congress and 5. 5 errors per record cataloged at the OCLC Participating Libraries. Once the errors were determined, analyzed, and noted, the author developed a policy/procedures manual for applying The Guidelines to the cataloging records for children 2 ̆ 7 s picture books and easy readers. The previously established policies of the EMC in regard to the handling of books in the Juvenile Collection were included. This manual, although designed using the EMC at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh, could be of practical use to any cataloger of children 2 ̆ 7 s picture books and easy readers...|$|E

They descend through the ventral thalamus, advance in the internal capsule amongst cells which already possess dorsal thalamic projections, traverse the striatocortical junction, and then reach the cerebral cortex by associating with subplate cells and their early corticofugal fibers.

These ideas are supported by recent work on reeler and other strains of mutant mice.
