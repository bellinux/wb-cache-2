40|$|Abstract- Polymeric {{materials}} {{are used in}} detergent formulations since thirty five years, for performing useful functions like adsorption on fabric, surface, clay soil dispersancy and removal of Ca and Mg ions by sequestrization. In the present work, rosinated alkyds have been synthesized based Coconut oil, Rosin & Maleic anhydrides. The entire samples have been analyzed for physicochemical characteristics like acid value, HLB ratio, viscosity, oxirane-oxygen value and molecular weight. The spectroscopic studies indicate the presence of free acid, ester, ether and free hydroxyl groups in the polymer structure. Use of polymeric materials in detergent gives good <b>foam</b> height, <b>cleansing</b> capability and stain removing chacteristics such formulations can be easily prepared and compared with the commercial samples. An alter-native production line has been suggested for existing alkyd resins plants and some formulations which are technically excellent, environ-mentally viable option and yet cost effective has been identified for pilot plant production...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to determine differences in micro¯ora on the nails {{of health care}} workers (HCWs) wearing arti®cial nails compared with control HCWs with native nails and to assess the effect on these micro¯ora of hand cleansing with antimicrobial soap or alcohol-based gel. Cultures were obtained from 21 HCWs wearing arti®cial nails and 20 control HCWs before and after using antimicrobial soap or alcohol-based <b>gel.</b> Before <b>cleansing</b> with soap, 86 % of HCWs with arti®cial nails had a pathogen (gram-negative bacilli, Staphylococcus aureus, or yeasts) isolated, compared with 35 % of controls (); a similar difference wasP p. 003 noted before hand <b>cleansing</b> with <b>gel</b> (68 % vs. 28 %;). Signi®cantly more HCWs with arti®cial nailsP p. 03 than controls had pathogens remaining after hand cleansing with soap or gel. Of HCWs with arti®cial nails, only 11 % cleared pathogens with soap compared with 38 % with gel. Of control HCWs, only 14 % cleared with soap compared with 80 % with gel. Arti®cial acrylic ®ngernails could contribute to the transmission of path-ogens, and their use by HCWs should be discouraged. Hand cleansing remains {{the most effective and}} least ex-pensive measure to prevent transmission of nosocomial infections [1 ± 3]. However, after even thorough hand cleansing, the ®ngernails, especially the subungual region...|$|R
30|$|Chlorhexidine (CHX) {{gluconate}} is a cationic biguanide {{that seems}} to act by adsorbing onto the cell wall of a microorganism, resulting in the leakage of intracellular components. At low concentration, it has a bacteriostatic effect. Although it is at a high concentration, CHX is bactericidal because of precipitation and/or coagulation of intracellular constituents [4]. Its optimal antimicrobial activity is at pH 5.5 – 7.0 [41]. CHX has a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, targeting both gram-positive and gram-negative microbes [4]. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of the previous use of eugenol-based materials to a permanent restoration on the marginal microleakage. It will also evaluate if mechanical cleansing associated or not to chemical <b>cleansing</b> with chlorhexidine <b>gel</b> can reduce eugenol influence on the marginal microleakage. The null hypothesis tested was that there is no difference in the performance of the different materials and cleaning protocols.|$|R
40|$|Synthetic biology has {{significantly}} advanced the rational design of trigger-inducible gene switches that program cellular {{behavior in a}} reliable and pre-dictable manner. Capitalizing on genetic componen-try, including the repressor PmeR and its cognate operator OPmeR, that has evolved in Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato DC 3000 to sense and re-sist plant-defence metabolites of the paraben class, we have designed a set of inducible and repress-ible mammalian transcription-control devices that could dose-dependently fine-tune transgene expres-sion in mammalian cells and mice in response to paraben derivatives. With an over 60 -years track record as licensed preservatives in the cosmetics in-dustry, paraben derivatives have become a common-place ingredient of most skin-care products includ-ing shower <b>gels,</b> <b>cleansing</b> toners and hand creams. As parabens can rapidly reach the bloodstream of mice following topical application, we used this fea-ture to percutaneously program transgene expres-sion of subcutaneous designer cell implants using off-the-shelf commercial paraben-containing skin-care cosmetics. The combination of non-invasive, transdermal and orthogonal trigger-inducible remote control of transgene expression may provide novel opportunities for dynamic interventions in future gene and cell-based therapies...|$|R
40|$|PurposeThis study {{compared}} the catheter-associated {{urinary tract infection}} (CAUTI) rates resulting {{from the use of}} four perineal care agents (soap-and-water, skin <b>cleansing</b> <b>foam,</b> 10 % povidone-iodine, and normal saline) among patients in intensive care units (ICUs). MethodsThis four-group experimental study was done with 97 adult patients who had urinary catheters over 2 days in three ICUs between April and July 2008. The patients received one of the four types of perineal care. Data collected included the incidence of CAUTI at baseline (prior to perineal care) and 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks after beginning perineal care. Patients were divided into UTI and non-UTI groups based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Healthcare Safety Network UTI definition to calculate incidence rates. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated by Cox's proportional hazard analysis. ResultsThe cumulative incidence of CAUTIs per 100 urinary catheter days were 3. 18 episodes during 1 week with urinary catheter, 3. 31 during 2 weeks, and 3. 04 during 4 weeks. No statistically significant difference in hazard ratios of CAUTIs for each perineal care agent was evident with reference to soap-and-water at 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks after beginning perineal care after controlling for age, use of antibiotics, fecal incontinence, consciousness level, fever, and diabetes. ConclusionsThe type of perineal care does not influence the incidence of CAUTIs. Further confirmatory studies with a larger patient population should be conducted, as well as determining perineal agent preference...|$|R
30|$|Four papers {{deal with}} {{adhesive}} dentistry aspects. They were presented by colleagues from the Brazilian dental materials community. Lopes et al. evaluated {{the influence of}} the previous use of eugenol based materials to a permanent restoration on the marginal microleakage. They also investigated the influence of mechanical cleansing associated with chemical <b>cleansing</b> with chlorhexidine <b>gel.</b> It was found that eugenol, when associated with endodontic or temporary restorative material, has no influence on the microleakage of the definitive composite resin restoration. The study presented by Da Silva et al. evaluated the shear bond strength of three different composite resins to fiber posts surfaces. The influence the adhesive used as pretreatment was also investigated. The authors concluded that the use of silorane based composite resins to customize posts requires the use of adhesive as surface pretreatment. Schwertner et al. evaluated the effect of green tea on the shear bond strength of metal orthodontic brackets to human enamel after home whitening treatment. They concluded that green tea is an alternative treatment to allow bracket bonding immediately after home whitening treatment. Another study on the shear bond strength of brackets to enamel was presented by Guiraldo et al. The objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate the enamel roughness and shear bond strength of dental composite after removal of metal brackets bonded with different adhesives. The shear bond test results shown that the 4 adhesives produced adequate bond strength, however the enamel did not return to the initial conditions.|$|R
30|$|The {{interference}} of eugenol on the adhesive {{systems and}} composite polymerization could promote a higher marginal microleakage. This {{could be reduced}} by mechanical and chemical cleansing. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the influence of the previous use of eugenol-based materials to a permanent restoration on the marginal microleakage. The influence of mechanical cleansing associated with chemical <b>cleansing</b> with chlorhexidine <b>gel</b> was also evaluated. Non-eugenol endodontic sealer and temporary material and mechanical cleansing was used as a control. Eighty bovine incisors were endodontic treated and divided into eight groups (n =  10) according to the sealer, temporary material and removal method. The specimens were temporarily restored and stored for 1  week at 37  °C and 100  % relative humidity, followed by definitive restoration and one-year storage at the same environment. The teeth were then sealed, immersed in silver nitrate at 50  % for 2  h and sectioned to have the microleakage qualitatively and quantitatively visually analyzed under a stereomicroscope at 45 ×. The percentage data were submitted to an ANOVA and Tukey’s test, and the scores were submitted to a Kruskal–Wallis and Dunn’s test at 5  % of the significance level. There was no difference between the groups when mechanical removal was made (p >  0.05). When chlorhexidine was used, the group that used endodontic eugenol based material as a sealer and the resin-based material as a temporary restoration showed less microleakage than the other (p <  0.05). All groups showed less microleakage when chlorhexidine was used instead of solely using mechanical removal (p <  0.05). For scores, when the eugenol based sealer was combined with resin-based temporary material, and when the resin sealer was combined with eugenol based temporary material using chlorhexidine, a lower median was found (p <  0.05) compared to all other groups. Eugenol showed no influence, and chlorhexidine gel showed to be effective in reducing microleakage.|$|R
