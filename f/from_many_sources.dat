5|$|The Allied {{forces on}} Bougainville {{detected}} the Japanese buildup. Information on {{the movement of}} the 17th Army was gained <b>from</b> <b>many</b> <b>sources,</b> including signals intelligence, patrols conducted by US Army troops into the interior of the island, aerial and naval patrols as well as the interrogation of Japanese prisoners. In addition, Japanese troops were also detected around the outpost, which was held by the 1stFiji Battalion at Ibu {{to the north of the}} perimeter. In response, Allied aircraft attacked bridges and areas in which Japanese troops were believed to be located. United States Navy PT boats and Landing Craft Infantry gunboats supported by PBY Catalina aircraft also patrolled the coast of Bougainville and attacked Japanese barges, but were unable to stop the movement of supplies and equipment by sea. In addition, American warships and aircraft periodically bombarded the main Japanese bases on Bougainville.|$|E
5|$|Writer Ed Burns, {{who worked}} as a public school teacher after {{retiring}} from the Baltimore police force shortly before going to work with Simon, has called education the theme of the fourth season. Rather than focusing solely on the school system, the fourth season looks at schools as a porous part of the community that are affected by problems outside of their boundaries. Burns states that education comes <b>from</b> <b>many</b> <b>sources</b> other than schools and that children can be educated by other means, including contact with the drug dealers they work for. Burns and Simon see the theme as an opportunity to explore how individuals end up like the show's criminal characters, and to dramatize the notion that hard work is not always justly rewarded.|$|E

Projectile points and hammerstones made <b>from</b> <b>many</b> <b>sources</b> are found traded or moved to new locations.

Trade routes also have been found from the British Columbia Interior to the coast of California.|$|E
25|$|While {{studies have}} {{reported}} inconsistent results with regards to music's effect on memory, it has been demonstrated that music is able to interfere with various memory tasks. It has been demonstrated that new situations require new combinations of cognitive processing. This subsequently results in conscious attention being drawn to novel aspects of situations. Therefore, the loudness of music presentation along with other musical elements can assist in distracting one from normal responses by encouraging attentiveness to the musical information. Attention and recall {{have been shown to}} be negatively affected by the presence of a distraction.
