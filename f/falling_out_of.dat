5|$|Across Europe, Dónde Están los Ladrones? was a {{commercial}} disappointment. In Germany, the album entered the Offizielle Top 100 albums chart at number 99 {{in the issue}} dated 11 February 2002. It finally peaked at number 79 weeks later, spending a total of nine {{weeks on the chart}}. In Netherlands, the album had a similar debut, at number 99 on 20 April 2002, <b>falling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the chart the next week. Two months later, it returned to the charts at number 88. After <b>falling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the chart one more time, the album returned to number 88 on 17 August 2002 and peaking at number 78 the week after. Dónde Están los Ladrones? debuted at number 89 in March 2002, and reached number 73 in late April. The album remained five weeks on the chart in total.|$|E
5|$|After <b>falling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{favor with}} Ali Pasha, for reasons unknown, Meksi left {{the court in}} 1810 to travel around Europe. During a brief stay in Venice he began to develop an {{interest}} in the Albanian alphabet and grammar. He published two translations into Albanian during 1814, both now lost, one of which was a religious work by Abbé Claude Fleury (1640–1723).|$|E

The {{following}} week the song moved up thirteen spaces to number three, {{which was the}} song's peak position. The song stayed at its peak position for two consecutive weeks, and remained on the country's chart for ten weeks, before <b>falling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the top 100 positions, only to re-enter the charts two weeks later.|$|E
5|$|As cheap {{reproductions of}} Hope, and from 1908 {{high-quality}} prints, began to circulate in large quantities, {{it became a}} widely popular image. President Theodore Roosevelt displayed a copy at his Sagamore Hill home in New York; reproductions circulated worldwide; and a 1922 film depicted Watts's creation of the painting and an imagined story behind it. By this time Hope was coming to seem outdated and sentimental, and Watts was rapidly <b>falling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> fashion. In 1938 the Tate Gallery ceased to keep their collection of Watts's works on permanent display.|$|E

5|$|Goodrich Castle was {{probably}} built by Godric of Mappestone after the Norman invasion of England, initially as an earth and wooden fortification. In {{the middle of}} the 12th century the original castle was replaced with a stone keep, and was then expanded significantly during the late 13th century into a concentric structure combining luxurious living quarters with extensive defences. The success of Goodrich's design influenced many other constructions across England over the following years. It became the seat of the powerful Talbot family before <b>falling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favour as a residence in late Tudor times.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, the Argentine austral {{replaced}} the discredited peso. In 1986, Argentina {{failed to pay}} the debt for several months, and the debt was renegotiated with the creditor banks. In 1986 and 1987, the Austral Plan faded away, as ﬁscal policy was undermined by large off-budget spending and a loose monetary policy, again <b>falling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> compliance with an IMF programme. A new IMF arrangement was reached in July 1987, only to collapse in March 1988.|$|E

5|$|Keith Richards as Edward Teague: Keeper of the Pirata Codex for the Brethren Court and Jack Sparrow's father. The other pirate lords are visibly {{terrified of}} him. Richards, who {{partially}} inspired Depp's portrayal of Sparrow, {{was meant to}} appear in Dead Man's Chest, {{but there was no}} room for him in the story, as well as his being tied up with a Rolling Stones tour. He almost missed filming a scene in At World's End, following injuries sustained by <b>falling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a tree. In June 2006, Verbinski finally managed to make room in Richards' schedule to shoot that September.|$|E
5|$|Language endangerment {{occurs when}} a {{language}} is at risk of <b>falling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> use as its speakers die out or shift to speaking another language. Language loss occurs when the language has no more native speakers, and becomes a dead language. If eventually no one speaks the language at all, it becomes an extinct language. While languages have always gone extinct throughout human history, they have been disappearing at an accelerated rate in the 20th and 21st centuries due to the processes of globalization and neo-colonialism, where the economically powerful languages dominate other languages.|$|E

After making 17 {{appearances}} for Chester, Higginbotham left {{the club in}} order to forge a media career. After leaving Chester, Higginbotham signed for Altrincham of the Conference North, as he wished to continue playing on a part-time basis with fewer travel commitments. Higginbotham had previously stated it was an ambition of his to play for Altrincham, as he had supported them as a boy. He announced his retirement from football on 8 January 2014.|$|E

5|$|Bostwick {{started his}} career at Millwall, and played {{regularly}} for the club's under-18 team and reserve team. At the age of 17, he joined Conference National club Crawley Town on work experience during the latter stages of 2005–06 season. On return to Millwall, Bostwick signed a new one-year contract with the club, but {{was sent back to}} Crawley Town on loan in August 2006. Bostwick played regularly for Crawley until he was recalled by Millwall in January 2007, and was told he was surplus to requirements at the club. He subsequently signed for Rushden & Diamonds on an 18-month contract, but only played eight matches before <b>falling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favour at Nene Park, and was released by Rushden {{at the end of the}} 2006–07 campaign.|$|E
5|$|By 2001, {{the notable}} successes of computer-animated films from Pixar and DreamWorks such as Monsters, Inc. and, Shrek, respectively, against Disney's lesser returns for The Emperor's New Groove and Atlantis: The Lost Empire {{led to a}} growing {{perception}} that hand-drawn animation was becoming outdated and <b>falling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> fashion. In March 2002, just after the successful release of Blue Sky Studios' computer-animated feature Ice Age, Disney laid off most of the employees at the Feature Animation studio in Burbank, downsizing it to one unit and beginning plans to move into fully computer animated films. A handful of employees were offered positions doing computer animation. Morale plunged to a low {{not seen since the}} start of the studio's ten-year exile to Glendale in 1985. The Paris studio was also closed in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Carpenter faced many {{problems}} associated with this, including {{the possibility of the}} Indians being rescued by their followers or being lynched by angry settlers, during their transport to the civilian court. During transport, Satank hid himself under his red blanket in his wagon while he gnawed the base of his thumb to the bone. This allowed him to slip the manacle from his wrist while he sang his death chant. With a small hidden knife that was not found during two separate searches, he stabbed the driver (who survived), both <b>falling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the wagon, grabbed a soldier's unloaded carbine and was mortally wounded in his escape attempt.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the winter}} break, Benzema endured a rough patch going {{scoreless}} {{the first three}} games before recording his 11th goal of the season against Nice in a 3–1 victory. Two weeks later, he scored his 12th goal against Nancy in a 2–0 victory. The next nine matches, both Benzema and Lyon's form dwindled losing four matches, drawing three and winning only two with Benzema scoring only two goals in that stretch, both of them against Le Mans in a 3–1 victory. The bad form resulted in Lyon losing their grip on first-place position and eventually <b>falling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the title race, thus ending their streak of seven consecutive Ligue 1 titles. Benzema {{was a part of}} four of those title runs.|$|E
5|$|Hitler {{intentionally}} played top {{party members}} off {{against one another}} and the NSDAP against the civil service. In this way, he fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. He typically did not give written orders; instead he communicated them verbally or had them conveyed through Bormann. <b>Falling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> favour with Bormann meant that access to Hitler was cut off. Bormann {{proved to be a}} master of intricate political infighting. Along with his ability to control access to Hitler, this enabled him to curtail the power of Joseph Goebbels, Göring, Himmler, Alfred Rosenberg, Robert Ley, Hans Frank, Speer, and other high-ranking officials, many of whom became his enemies. This ruthless and continuous intriguing for power, influence, and Hitler's favour came to characterise {{the inner workings of the}} Third Reich.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} and later Republic, {{with the office of}} {{dictator}} <b>falling</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> fashion, the need for dictatorial authority was not granted to some extraordinary magistrate, but rather, to the consuls, through a senatus consultum ultimum, or final decree. This decree took the form of a recommendation from the Senate to the consuls to take whatever actions were necessary to defend the republic. Due to its general vagueness, however, its use was hotly contested in the late Republic and is still debated among scholars today, as in a strict legal sense, the final decree did not grant legal authority to the consuls, but rather, served as an urging from the Senate to ignore the laws to protect the state.|$|E
