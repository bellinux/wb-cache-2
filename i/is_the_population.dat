500|$|The {{species can}} be divided into four genetically {{distinct}} populations, one widespread population, and three which have diverged due to small effective population sizes, possibly due to adaptation to the local environment.

The populations in the Mediterranean Sea are distinct from those in the Atlantic Ocean.

2500|$|As {{hermit crabs}} grow, they require larger shells. Since {{suitable}} intact gastropod shells are sometimes a limited resource, vigorous competition often occurs among hermit crabs for shells. The availability of empty shells {{at any given}} place depends on the relative abundance of gastropods and hermit crabs, matched for size. An equally important issue <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>population</b> of organisms that prey upon gastropods and leave the shells intact. Hermit crabs kept together may fight or kill a competitor {{to gain access to}} the shell they favour. However, if the crabs vary significantly in size, the occurrence of fights over empty shells will decrease or remain nonexistent. [...] Hermit crabs with too-small shells cannot grow as fast as those with well-fitting shells, and are more likely to be eaten if they cannot retract completely into the shell.|$|E
