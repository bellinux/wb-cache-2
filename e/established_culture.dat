50|$|Since {{plans for}} the new culture and {{convention}} center arose in the late 1980s, Lucerne has found {{a balance between the}} so-called <b>established</b> <b>culture</b> and alternative culture. A consensus was reached that culminated in a culture compromise (Kulturkompromiss). The <b>established</b> <b>culture</b> comprises the Lucerne Culture and Congress Centre (KKL), the city theater (Luzerner Theater) and, in a broader sense, smaller establishments such as the Kleintheater, founded by comedian Emil Steinberger, a Lucerne native, or Stadtkeller, a music restaurant in the city's old town. KKL houses a concert hall as well as the Museum of Art Lucerne (Kunstmuseum Luzern).|$|E
40|$|Bitectatodinium tepikiense Wilson cysts, first {{described}} from Pleistocene sediments and generally associated with sediments in temperate to cold-temperate waters, were germinated to <b>establish</b> <b>cultures.</b> The motile thecate cells derived were referable to Gonyaulax digitale (Pouchet) Kofoid. For {{the first time}} detailed morphological information is given for the motile stage of this cyst-theca relationship. Cultures were re-encysted; the cultured cysts showed a range of morphology from spherical cysts to those with an apical boss. The taxonomy of Gonyaulax digitale and cyst-theca relationships within the Spiniferites plexus are discussed but, given the debate surrounding {{the status of the}} genera Gonyaulax and Spiniferites, no formal taxonomic reassignments are proposed. These observations confirm that <b>establishing</b> <b>cultures</b> of cyst taxa in problematic dinoflagellate groupings and meticulous high-resolution scanning electron microscopic observation of the specimens have great potential for elucidating cyst-theca relationships and clarifying dinoflagellate taxonomy...|$|R

50|$|He {{then begins}} to {{distinguish}} between the first slaves arriving from Senegal, The Gambia and Guinea, and the later slaves coming from Ghana, Nigeria, and the Cameroons.

50|$|The {{ancestors}} of Native Hawaiians may have {{arrived in the}} Hawaiian Islands around 350 CE, from other areas of Polynesia. By the time Captain Cook arrived, Hawaii had a well <b>established</b> <b>culture</b> with a population estimated to be between 400,000 and 900,000 people. In the first one hundred years of contact with western civilization, due to war and sickness, the Hawaiian population dropped by ninety percent, with only 53,900 people in 1876. American missionaries would arrive in 1820 and assume great power and influence. Despite formal recognition of the Kingdom of Hawaii by the United States and other world powers, American influence, with assistance from the US Navy, eventually took over the islands, overthrowing their Queen in the process. The kingdom was overthrown beginning January 17, 1893 with a coup d'état orchestrated by, mostly, Americans within the kingdom's legislature, with aid from the United States military.|$|E
5000|$|Cross Damon was {{a fictional}} {{character}} from Richard Wright's 1953 novel The Outsider. Cross Damon {{was viewed as}} an [...] "outsider" [...] who {{did not attempt to}} become a product of the <b>established</b> <b>culture</b> of American society. Cross was considered a complete opposite to Bigger Thomas, another character created by Richard Wright in his novel Native Son. He also ridicules Communist techniques and lives according to the principles of free choice. Cross Damon committed murder in a completely different spirit than Bigger Thomas. He acts as an individual who is free to do whatever his habits and desires lead him to do. His is not a victim of social and environmental pressures outside his control. In many ways, Cross Damon resembles Meursault, the hero of Albert Camus novel The Stranger. Both men lived outside of any involvement with common humanity and paid no attention to social mores.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this book is to examine {{cultural}} aspects of hegemonic relations between White Americans and African Americans, a neglected topic which the author believes should {{provide the basis for}} African American Studies programs. Although Semmes <b>establishes</b> <b>culture</b> as the focus of his analysis, political and economic forces are clearly important for understanding the position of Black Americans in the changing social organization of the U. S. Defined as regularly in subjective states, culture is theorized as interacting with social organization, as institutional settings frame cultural expressions and vice versa...|$|R
5000|$|A {{different}} view of cultural appropriation characterizes critics of the practice as [...] "engaged in a deeply conservative project: one which first seeks to preserve in formaldehyde the content of an <b>established</b> <b>culture</b> and second tries to prevent others from interacting with that culture." [...] On the contrary, cultures as they exist now are themselves the products of previous instances of cultural appropriation. Appropriation can be wrongful under this view, but the wrongfulness {{is determined by the}} intent of the appropriator and not the perceived power dynamics between the cultures. Proponents of cultural appropriation view it as often benign or mutually beneficial, citing mutation, product diversity, technological diffusion, and cultural empathy as among its benefits. For example, the film Star Wars appropriated elements from Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress, which itself appropriated elements from Shakespeare; culture in the aggregate is arguably better off for each instance of appropriation. Fusion between cultures has produced such foods as American Chinese cuisine, modern Japanese sushi, and bánh mì, each of which is sometimes argued to reflect part of its respective culture's identity.|$|E

However, by the tenth subculture, the population of cells no longer reflected the heterozygous genotype in 50 % of the cultures, as only a single G 6 PD isozyme was expressed. The ultimate cell composition seems to be influenced by the initial composition, by the nature of alleles at heterozygous X-linked loci that may provide a growth advantage (or disadvantage), as well as by stochastic events. Our results show that lymphoblast cultures may not reflect the X-linked phenotype of the cells from which they were derived. The fate of such cultures seems to be evolution toward clonal cell populations...|$|R
