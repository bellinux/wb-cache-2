40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new methodological {{framework}} within which the <b>heat</b> <b>conductance</b> in 1 D lattices can be studied. The total process of <b>heat</b> <b>conductance</b> is separated into two parts where {{the first one is}} the equilibrium process at equal temperatures T of both ends and the second one [...] non-equilibrium with the temperature Δ T of one end and zero temperature of the other. This approach allows significant decrease of computational time at Δ T → 0. The threshold temperature T_ thr is found which scales T_ thr(N) ∼ N^- 3 with the lattice size N and by convention separates two mechanisms of heat conductance: phonon mechanism dominates at T T_ thr. Solitons and breathers are directly visualized in numerical experiments. The problem of <b>heat</b> <b>conductance</b> in non-linear lattices in the limit Δ T → 0 can be reduced to the <b>heat</b> <b>conductance</b> of harmonic lattice with time-dependent stochastic rigidities determined by the equilibrium process at temperature T.

40|$|Abstract Finite-time {{thermodynamics}} is {{the extension}} of traditional reversible thermodynamics to include the extra requirement that the process in question goes to completion in a specified finite length of time. As such it is by definition a branch of irreversible thermodynamics, but unlike most other versions of irreversible thermodynamics, finite-time thermodynamics does not require or assume any knowledge about the microscopics of the processes, since the irreversibilities are described by macroscopic constants such as friction coefficients, <b>heat</b> <b>conductances,</b> reaction rates and the like. Some concepts of reversible thermodynamics, such as potentials and availability, generalize nicely to finite time, others are completely new, e. g. endoreversibility and thermodynamic length. The basic ideas of finite-time thermodynamics are reviewed and several of its procedures presented, emphasizing the importance of power and rate of entropy production.
