5|$|<b>Having,</b> <b>it</b> is believed, {{purchased}} the plates of Molyneux's globes, Jodocus Hondius {{was granted a}} ten-year privilege on 1 April 1597 to make and publish a terrestrial globe. In that year, he produced in Amsterdam a Dutch translation of Hues' Tractatus de Globis. On 31 October 1598, despite a legal challenge by rival globe-maker Jacob van Langeren, Hondius obtained another privilege for ten years. He duly published globes in 1600 and 1601, and his sons Henricus and Jodocus published a pair in 1613. Hondius also published a world map in 1608 on the Mercator projection. Its reliance on the Molyneux globe is shown {{by a number of}} legends, names and outlines which must have been copied directly from it.|$|E
5|$|Low {{back pain}} that lasts {{at least one}} day and limits {{activity}} is a common complaint.

Approximately 9 to 12% of people (632million) have LBP at any given point in time, and nearly one quarter (23.2%) report <b>having</b> <b>it</b> at some point over any one-month period.

5|$|Maneater {{is one of}} the few {{films in}} the series to break the {{standard}} formula of Syfy natural horror films with its use of a normal, living tiger rather than a CG animal or excusing its behavior by <b>having</b> <b>it</b> be a mutant or genetically altered. Critics heavily panned the film citing substandard acting, heavy use of stereotypical characters, a hole-filled plot, unused subplots, and the use of a live tiger resulting in almost all attacks being implied rather than seen.|$|E

5|$|Pipe Dream is {{the seventh}} musical {{by the team}} of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II; it premiered on Broadway on November 30, 1955. The work is based on John Steinbeck's short novel Sweet Thursday—Steinbeck wrote the novel, a sequel to Cannery Row, {{in the hope of}} <b>having</b> <b>it</b> adapted into a musical. Set in Monterey, California, the musical {{tells the story of the}} romance between Doc, a marine biologist, and Suzy, who in the novel is a prostitute; her {{profession}} is only alluded to in the stage work. Pipe Dream was a flop and a financial disaster for Rodgers and Hammerstein.|$|E

Edwin dies from a heroin overdose, resulting in the family smuggling the body out of a hospital and nearly <b>having</b> <b>it</b> discovered by the police.

5|$|Tooth {{eruption}} may {{be altered}} by some environmental factors. When eruption is prematurely stopped, the tooth {{is said to}} be impacted. The most common cause of tooth impaction is lack of space in the mouth for the tooth. Other causes may be tumors, cysts, trauma, and thickened bone or soft tissue. Tooth ankylosis occurs when the tooth has already erupted into the mouth but the cementum or dentin has fused with the alveolar bone. This may cause a person to retain their primary tooth instead of <b>having</b> <b>it</b> replaced by a permanent one.|$|E

5|$|During the Abbasid Revolution, however, he {{was forced}} to submit to the Abbasid armies under Abu Muslim. As one of Abu Muslim's vassals, he {{supported}} the latter in his quarrel with the Caliph al-Mansur (r. 754–775). After the Caliph had Abu Muslim murdered in 755, Khurshid supported the anti-Abbasid rebellion of Sunbadh, who entrusted part of Abu Muslim's treasure to Khurshid's keeping. When Sunbadh's revolt was defeated, Sunbadh fled to Tabaristan, but was killed there by one of Khurshid's cousins, ostensibly because he had failed to show the man proper respect. It is possible, however, that the murder was instigated by Khurshid, in the hope of acquiring the remainder of Abu Muslim's treasure. Al-Mansur sent his son and heir, al-Mahdi (r. 775–785), to recover the treasure of Abu Muslim. Khurshid denied <b>having</b> <b>it,</b> and al-Mansur tried to unseat Khurshid by crowning one of his cousins as ispahbadh. This did not have the desired effect of challenging the loyalty of Khurshid's subjects, but Khurshid was eventually forced to accommodate the Abbasids by accepting an increase in the annual tribute, which brought it to the level paid to the Sassanids.|$|E
5|$|Having been vocal in criticising Playford for sacrificing {{heritage}} to {{the march}} of development, Dunstan was prominent in protecting historic buildings from being bulldozed for high-rise office blocks. In 1972, the government intervened to purchase and thereby save Edmund Wright House on King William Street from being replaced with a skyscraper. In 1975, the Customs House at Semaphore was purchased to save it from demolition. His support of heritage preservation overlapped with his promotion of gourmet dining when his personal efforts helped to save the historic Ayers House on North Terrace, <b>having</b> <b>it</b> converted into a restaurant to avoid demolition. In contrast, there were also some controversial developments. Part of the rocky Hallett Cove on Gulf St Vincent in Adelaide's southern suburbs was developed for housing, as were vineyards in Morphettville, Tea Tree Gully, Modbury, and Reynella. This attracted criticism, as Dunstan was prominent in promoting South Australian viticulture and enotourism.|$|E
5|$|Helmichis' coup {{ultimately}} {{failed because}} it met strong {{opposition from the}} many Lombards who wanted to continue {{the war against the}} Byzantines and to confront the regicides. Faced with the prospect of going to war at overwhelming odds, Helmichis asked for help from the Byzantines. The praetorian prefect Longinus enabled him to avoid a land route possibly held by hostile forces, by shipping him instead down the Po to Byzantine-held Ravenna, together with his wife, his Lombard and Gepid troops, the royal treasure and Albsuinda. Bognetti believes that Longinus may have planned to make the Lombards weaker by depriving them of any legitimate heir. In addition, because of the ongoing war, it was hard to assemble all the warriors to elect a new king formally. This plan was brought to nothing by the troops stationed in Ticinum, who elected their duke Cleph king, <b>having</b> <b>it</b> in mind to continue Alboin's aggressive policy. In contrast, Wolfram argues that Cleph was elected in Ticinum while Helmichis was still making his bid for the crown in Verona.|$|E

5|$|The Ash Garden {{is a novel}} {{written by}} Canadian author Dennis Bock and {{published}} in 2001. It is Bock's first novel, following the 1998 release of Olympia, {{a collection of short}} stories. The Ash Garden follows the stories of three main characters affected by World War II: Hiroshima bombing victim Emiko, German nuclear physicist Anton Böll, and Austrian-Jewish refugee Sophie Böll. The narrative is non-linear, jumping between different times and places, and the point of view alternates between the characters; Emiko's story being written in the first person while Anton and Sophie's stories are written in the third person. Bock took several years to write the novel, re-writing several drafts, before <b>having</b> <b>it</b> published in August 2001 by HarperCollins (Canada), Alfred A.
