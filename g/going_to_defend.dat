500|$|On the October 29, 2009, {{episode of}} Impact!, then-champion Eric Young renamed the title the [...] "TNA Global Championship". He {{went on to}} declare {{that he was not}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> it against any American wrestlers nor on American soil. However, Young's first defense was on the December 10, 2009, episode of Impact! in Orlando, Florida against Japanese female wrestler Hamada. Young's second, third and fourth {{defenses}} lived up to his earlier decree, when he defended against Suicide in Glasgow, Hamada in Bournemouth, and unsuccessfully against Welsh wrestler Rob Terry in Cardiff, Wales at a live event on January 27, 2010. On the July 22, 2010, episode of Impact!, Terry lost the Global Championship to A.J. Styles. Styles then renamed the title the [...] "TNA Television Championship" [...] on the July 29, 2010, episode of Impact!.|$|E
2500|$|Hushovd and Steegmans {{dropped on}} the Col d'Osquich, {{then the rest of}} the group got split into lots of {{different}} smaller groups during the climb of the Col de Soudet with Cyril Dessel and Juan Miguel Mercado passing the top of the climb first. During the descent Landaluze, Rinero, Isasi, Vasseur and Moreni managed to return. The peloton was about 10 minutes behind at that time, as [...] had decided they were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> their yellow jersey and leave the work for the next stages for some other team.|$|E
2500|$|Vergne's {{right hand}} {{was injured in}} the {{collision}} with Piquet and required an X-ray scan after complaining {{he was unable to}} move it correctly. He was annoyed with Piquet and briefly visited the NextEV garage to know if the latter had also retired. Vergne stated that he would ensure that he was fit for the next race of the season in Paris but felt the incident [...] "destroyed" [...] his race in Monaco. He believed that the crash prevented him from finishing on the podium and chose not to speak to Piquet after the event ended. Piquet was annoyed at Vergne's attempts at overtaking him, labelling him [...] "impatient" [...] and felt he could have been easily passed during the pit stop phase. He thought Vergne would slow down because the latter was unwilling to be overtaken around the outside, and that Vergne had placed himself in that situation, deeming it [...] "unnecessary" [...] but felt it was a [...] "racing incident": [...] "It's a shame, I hate that it happened with him and I hate these kinds of situations. I don't like bad feelings and I'm sure he's very upset and thinks I did it on purpose, but I was just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> my position." [...] Vergne represented the incident as less important six days later by saying he did not regret performing his manoeuvre and it was part of motor racing.|$|E
500|$|Although Brühl {{thought the}} film [...] "very realistic", he was {{dissatisfied}} with his character's authenticity. The actor felt [...] "attached" [...] to Jan, admiring his [...] "courage {{to want to}} change the way things are <b>going,</b> <b>to</b> act <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> his beliefs", but thought it was [...] "very utopian and naive, that they take so much risk to break into some rich man's house to move things around." ...|$|R
50|$|Vladimir Guerrero of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim was {{originally}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> participate <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> his 2007 title, but he ultimately declined the invitation {{in order to}} spend time with his family. Morneau became the first Canadian player to win the derby since its introduction in the 1985 MLB season.|$|R
50|$|Golovin {{was then}} {{scheduled}} to represent France in the Fed Cup team competition versus China before <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> her semi-final points in Antwerp. However, due {{to yet another}} injury for Golovin, this time to her back, {{she was forced to}} pull out of both competitions. A small consolation in this time period was the fact that, due to Nadia Petrova failing <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> her title at Paris in 2007, she climbed a spot to a career high ranking of 12.|$|R

It was sponsored by Pridi himself, produced a Thai historical drama film, The King of the White Elephant.

5000|$|Lima was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>defended</b> {{at first}} by the {{remaining}} Peruvian army and by {{a vast number of}} civilians in the line of San Juan - Chorrillos; the American engineer Paul Boyton narrates that [...] " [...] the troops were of natives who had been recruited in the mountain ranges and forced to fight, hundreds of them never had seen before a city [...] ". On the other hand, the strategic line of Miraflores was defended by more troops than civilians.|$|R

I suppose in strict {{morality}} I ought to leave the lodgings. But, by George, I don't see why a man's to be turned out in that way. And then I couldn't make a clean score with old mother Roper.

5000|$|... 15th: ROUND 2 v Brisbane Roar at the Sydney Football Stadium, {{results in}} Sydney FC's first {{loss of the}} season, <b>going</b> down 2-0 <b>to</b> <b>defending</b> Premiers & Champions Brisbane.

50|$|Although 1986 saw {{promotion}} to Division 1 of the league, the championship campaign ended in disappointment with a Connacht Semi-Final defeat to Roscommon at McHale Park. The following year saw Mayo reach the Connacht Final, going {{down on this}} occasion to Galway in a low scoring match, 0-7 to 0-8. 1988 saw the team slide to Division 2, but Connacht wins over Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon in the final saw them reach another All-Ireland Semi-Final. Reigning All-Ireland champions Meath proved too strong for Mayo, running out 0-16 to 2-5 winners, and then <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> their title.|$|R
50|$|On {{the nights}} of April 24, 25, 30 and May 1, the British Navy {{evacuated}} about 51,000 men from Athens, most to Crete, some to Alexandria. The Germans held air superiority. Having destroyed the Italian Navy by night {{through the use}} of marine radar, which the Italians did not have, the British held command of the sea, but only by night. Included in the 51,000 were King George II of Greece and his new government. Ioannis Metaxas, former Prime MInister, had died recently. With him came surviving elements of the Greek 12th and 20th Infantry Divisions. The King and new Prime Minister, Emmanouil Tsouderos, were offered a mansion in Pelikapina on the outskirts of Khania. They were protected by a New Zealand unit assigned to guard them. British intelligence at this point was high quality. The British knew they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> against a parachute attack soon. Winston Churchill was convinced, however, that the island could not be taken by parachute troops.|$|R

I’ve taken up a good many risky deals and put them through, fighting the men who meant to down me as best I could; but all my business hasn’t been a raid on somebody else’s property. In fact, you can’t play the bold pirate too often. Very well; now and then, when I was doing an innocent trade, I wanted a respectable associate {{as a kind of}} guarantee, and asked your father to stand in. He’s known as a straight man, and my having him helped to disarm suspicion; I’ll admit that I found him useful in that respect. I hope I’ve said enough to satisfy you?” ...|$|E
6000|$|It was in {{the early}} summer of 1792 that Miss Burney again met Burke at Mrs. Crewe's villa at Hampstead. He entered into an {{animated}} conversation on Lord Macartney and the Chinese expedition, reviving all the old enthusiasm of his companion by his allusions and anecdotes, his brilliant fancies and wide information. When politics were introduced, he spoke with an eagerness and a vehemence that instantly banished the graces, though it redoubled the energies of his discourse. [...] "How I wish," [...] Miss Burney writes, [...] "that you could meet this wonderful man when he is easy, happy, and with people he cordially likes! But politics, even on his own side, must always be excluded; his irritability is so terrible on that theme, that it gives immediately to his face the expression of a man who is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> himself from murderers." ...|$|E

[...] "I don't quite know what you mean, Sir Harry. I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> myself. I have done much of which I am ashamed. I was turned very young upon the world, and got to live with rich people when I was myself poor. I ought to have withstood the temptation, but I didn't, and I got into bad hands. I don't deny it.

He also defended L. K. Advani in the Hawala scam. He was in the news for taking up the defence of Manu Sharma, prime accused in the Jessica Lall murder case; however, he failed to get Manu Sharma acquitted. He is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>defending</b> Lalit Modi - former Indian Premier League (IPL) chairman and commissioner.|$|R
40|$|The {{legitimacy}} of pedagogy, as scientific and philosophical discipline about education, {{has been questioned}} after the arrival of post-modernity. Postmodernity has suspected about traditional rationality and values of educational activity. but, at which point are <b>going</b> the pedagogues <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> the rationality of their proposals? Is still education the sphere of reason’s development in the students? Decisive questions like these are demanding the reconstruction of pedagogical reason, reconstruction which has to use the rubbles of postmodern deconstruction, but otherwise cannot reject democratic modernity and {{a great amount of}} its axiological legacy...|$|R
50|$|The second {{match for}} Wrestle Kingdom 10 {{was set up}} on November 7, 2015, after Shinsuke Nakamura had {{successfully}} defended the IWGP Intercontinental Championship against Karl Anderson at Power Struggle. Before the match, Nakamura had announced he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>defending</b> his title at the Tokyo Dome in an open challenge and asked for his challenger to come forward at Power Struggle. Following the match, Anderson's Bullet Club stablemate A.J. Styles entered the ring and made a challenge for the IWGP Intercontinental Championship, which was promptly accepted by Nakamura. The title match was officially announced {{in a press conference}} two days later. Styles was pulled from NJPW's end-of-the-year World Tag League due to a back injury, but it was announced that he would be returning at Wrestle Kingdom 10. This would mark the first singles match between Nakamura and Styles with the two having previously only met in one tag team match in August 2008.|$|R

"There is {{no doubt}} that the next {{campaign}} will be a hot one for, now that Spain has been as completely subdued as such vainglorious, excitable people can be subdued, the French marshals are free to join against us; and it is hard to see how, with but 30,000 men, we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> Portugal against ten times that number of French. Still, I suppose we shall do it, somehow. The French have a large army on the other side of the Aqueda, and there {{is no doubt}} they will besiege Ciudad Rodrigo, as soon as winter is over. I doubt whether we shall be strong enough to march to its relief, and I fancy that in that direction the Coa will be about our limit. At any rate, it is likely to be a stirring campaign.|$|E

"My idea is this: that {{we should}} load up all your camels with closely-pressed bundles of forage; then {{that we should}} advance a day's march across the desert; and there that we should form a zareba. With the forage we should, of course, take water-skins with us, with {{sufficient}} to last {{for at least a}} week. I should send the camels back again as soon as they are unloaded, and should order those who remained behind to load all their goods upon them and to set out either for the other douar of your tribe or for the villages to the south. I should send a messenger to the other douar to say that we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> the zareba to the last and praying them to come at once to our rescue, promising the moment they appear to sally out and fall upon the dervishes while they attack them in rear. Your messenger should point out that before they arrive a number of the enemy will certainly have fallen in their attack upon us, and we shall, therefore, be decidedly superior to them in point of numbers." ...|$|E

Of course I shall go too; but some of you with black masks over your faces, who, I suppose, live near here, may know something about me, and may know that my life is not so pleasant a one that I value it in the slightest.

5000|$|The Ombudsman for the City of Toronto, Fiona Crean, {{published}} {{a report in}} September 2012 suggesting that Mayor Ford's office had [...] "compromised" [...] the civic appointments process for city boards and agencies. Crean and her report was questioned by Council while Rob Ford remained silent, instead choosing to respond later on {{a radio talk show}} by stating: [...] "When people are just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make up stories about you, why are you even <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> yourself when you know it's just a bunch of malarkey." [...] The Ombudsman and the existence of the position itself were later criticized by Ford and became the subject of further debate. In October, Mayor Ford said he wanted to eliminate three watchdog positions: that of the Ombudsman, the Integrity Commissioner and the lobbyist registrar. [...] "You don't need a lobbyist registry, an ombudsman and an integrity commissioner. They have 20 people; they're tripping over themselves. They're trying to make themselves look busy." [...] All three positions are required under Ontario law and were established after the MFP computer leasing scandal inquiry.|$|R

[...] This Mrs. Burton said with an air of great authority; after which she continued in a voice something less stern--"He thought of doing no injury to you when he went to see her; but something of the feeling of his old love grew upon him when he was in her company, and he became embarrassed by his position before he was aware of his own danger. He might, of course, have been stronger." [...] Here Florence exhibited a gesture of strong impatience, though she did not speak. [...] "I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>defend</b> him altogether, but I think you must admit that he was hardly tried. Of course I can not say what passed between them, but I can understand how easily they might recur to the old scenes--how naturally she would wish for a renewal of the love which she had been base enough to betray! She does not, however, consider herself as at present engaged to him. That you may know for certain. It may be that she has asked him for such a promise, and that he has hesitated. If so, his staying away from us, and his not writing to you, can be easily understood." ...|$|E

You, after all, are concerned in the consistency of your representative. Now I think a public man who spends overmuch time in vindicating his consistency, makes a mistake. I will confess to you in friendly confidence, that I have winced when I read of lifelong friends of mine saying that I have, in certain Indian transactions, shelved the principles of a lifetime. One of your countrymen said that, like the Python--that fabulous animal who had the largest swallow that any creature ever enjoyed--I have swallowed all my principles. I am a little disappointed at such clatter as this. When a man has laboured for more years than I care to count, for Liberal principles and Liberal causes, and thinks he may possibly have accumulated a little credit in the bank of public opinion--and in the opinion of his party and his friends--it is a most extraordinary and unwelcome surprise to him, when he draws a very small cheque indeed upon that capital, to find the cheque returned with the uncomfortable and ill-omened words, [...] "No effects."
