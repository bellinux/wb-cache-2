In their homes, women take care of their children and cook.|$|E

5|$|Interest in the Dole Gudbrandsdal {{continued}} through World War II, {{and the horses}} were used heavily during Norway's occupation by Germany. Breed numbers and interest diminished after the war as increasing mechanization reduced demand for draft animals; however, a breeding center was established in 1962 to <b>help</b> <b>maintain</b> population numbers. In 1947, the National Dølehorse Association was formed to promote and preserve the breed.

5|$|Management of {{the site}} {{requires}} moderate grazing {{during the summer and}} autumn to <b>help</b> <b>maintain</b> the species diversity. This is because grazing removes each year's new growth which helps stop the site becoming dominated by vigorously growing grasses. Such grasses would allow a buildup of dead organic matter, which together with the increased growth, would reduce the growth of less vigorous species. The overall effect would be a reduction in species diversity, {{which was one of the}} reasons for the SSSI designation. Trampling can be of benefit because it breaks up accumulated dead organic matter.|$|E

5|$|It is {{estimated}} that there are about 1031 viruses on Earth. Most of them are bacteriophages, and most are in the oceans.

Viruses are the main agents responsible for the rapid destruction of harmful algal blooms, which often kill other marine life, and <b>help</b> <b>maintain</b> the ecological balance of different species of marine blue-green algae, and thus adequate oxygen production for life on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Louis XIV of France {{sought to}} knock Emperor Leopold {{out of the}} war by seizing Vienna, the Habsburg capital, and gain a {{favourable}} peace settlement. The dangers to Vienna were considerable: the Elector of Bavaria and Marshal Marsin's forces in Bavaria threatened from the west, and Marshal Vendôme's large army in northern Italy posed a serious danger with a potential offensive through the Brenner Pass. Vienna was also under pressure from Rákóczi's Hungarian revolt from its eastern approaches. Realising the danger, the Duke of Marlborough resolved to alleviate the peril to Vienna by marching his forces south from Bedburg and <b>help</b> <b>maintain</b> Emperor Leopold within the Grand Alliance.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{treaties}} were signed, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, acting {{in his capacity}} as US Indian agent, visited La Pointe. He reprimanded Buffalo for not stopping the continuing sporadic warfare between the Ojibwa and Dakota. Buffalo replied that he was unable to stop the young men of Lac Courte Oreilles, St. Croix, Lac du Flambeau or other bands beyond La Pointe from going against the Dakota. Historians take this to mean that while he was regarded as the head spokesman of the Ojibwa in Wisconsin, he could not control the day-to-day affairs of all the bands, which were highly decentralized, particularly about warfare. Buffalo also said that, unlike the British before the War of 1812, the U.S. Government had not done enough to <b>help</b> <b>maintain</b> the peace among the tribes.|$|E
5|$|The final French {{operation}} in the Atlantic during the campaign {{was an attempt to}} send seven frigates and corvettes to the French West Indies in September, laden with supplies to <b>help</b> <b>maintain</b> the strength and morale of the garrisons. With Willaumez believed to be still at sea, September 1806 seemed a good time to send a squadron into the Atlantic, but in fact the force was spotted within hours of leaving Rochefort by the British blockade force under Commodore Sir Samuel Hood. Hood's force gave chase and the large ships of the line soon caught up the frigates in heavy weather. Sending four of his ships off in different directions, Soleil attempted to give them cover with his three largest vessels, but after a hard-fought battle in which Hood lost an arm, four of the French frigates were captured.|$|E

They came respectively from East Africa, Mauritius and the Seychelles. One company worked the standard bed frame palm hurdles into the required shapes and fixed them together to make tank bodies, turrets and other dummy vehicle elements. The second company prepared hessian covers for the vehicle elements. The third company painted and prepared the dummies to the required degree of realism. Since the different Pioneer companies did not like one another, Barkas moved their camps as far apart as possible. To <b>help</b> <b>maintain</b> security, a NAAFI canteen was set up exclusively for the camouflage workers, to help keep everyone in camp.|$|E
5|$|Posehn had a {{difficult}} time working within the Genesis's output resolution of 320×240. He wanted to show as much of the playing field as possible without losing the details of the sprites; he felt a lack of graphical detail would make them less interesting. Posehn developed a dynamic camera system to <b>help</b> <b>maintain</b> what he felt was the right balance between the size of the field in view {{and the size of the}} game objects. The camera travels on an elliptic curve as the helicopter rotates to change the direction it travels; this puts whatever is in front of the helicopter more in view on screen. Posehn also integrated momentum to the camera movements to smooth transitions. He spent several months working on the physics for the screen and helicopter to ensure realistic movement. Instead of using completely accurate physics, Posehn chose to model movement that he believed players would assume a helicopter would have. He believed players would be put off by physics that didn't match their perceived movement.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} his military service during the war, Musial returned to baseball in 1946 and resumed his consistent hitting. That year {{he earned his}} second MVP award and third World Series title. His third MVP award came in 1948, when he finished one home run short of winning baseball's Triple Crown. After struggling offensively in 1959, Musial used a personal trainer to <b>help</b> <b>maintain</b> his productivity until he decided to retire in 1963. At {{the time of his}} retirement, he held or shared 17 major league records, 29 National League records, and nine All-Star Game records. Ironically, in 1964, the season following his retirement, the Cardinals went on to defeat the New York Yankees in an epic 7-game clash, for St. Louis' first World Series championship in nearly two decades (a team which included future Hall of Famer Lou Brock performing what would have likely been Musial's left field duties). In addition to overseeing businesses, such as a restaurant both before and after his playing career, Musial served as the Cardinals' general manager in 1967, winning the pennant and World Series, then quitting that position. He also became noted for his harmonica playing, a skill he acquired during his playing career. Known for his modesty and sportsmanship, Musial was selected for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. In February 2011, President Barack Obama presented Musial with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the highest civilian awards that can be bestowed on a person by the United States government.|$|E
