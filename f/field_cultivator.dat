One hundred and eighty-three interviewer administered questionnaires to active open <b>field</b> <b>cultivators</b> were used to collect data over three consecutive seasons 2011 / 2012, 2012 / 2013 and 2013 / 2014. Results show that manual power is used by 73 % of the respondents in land preparation, 25 and 2 % use motorized and draft animal power respectively. Trend analysis on power used for land preparation indicates an increase of 5 % in motorized power whilst manual power use, decreased by 9 % for the same period. Planting is carried out manually by all open field cultivators; 97 % using family labour and 7 % using hired labour. Sixty-five percent, of cultivators use the basal fertilizer, 7 % use ammonium nitrate, and 28 % do not use any type of fertilizer on their maize crop. Crop maintenance is limited to weeding; all <b>cultivators</b> weed their <b>fields</b> mechanically using hoes. Only 3 % indicated using agro-chemicals for pest control, and 17 % used scarecrows to deal with bird and animal problems. Average maize yields from open field cultivation vary between 0. 8 â€“ 4 t/ha.

Monpa people at Dirang Circle are classified into two groups according to their lifestyle, "Unpa (<b>field</b> <b>cultivators</b> at lower altitude) " and "Brokpa (pastoralists at higher altitude) ". One of the major characteristics of Brokpa's livelihood is seasonal moving around the grazing land at the altitude from 3000 m to 4500 m with Yak, cow and their cross-breeding, or sheep. Brokpa have close relationship with Unpa in terms of landholding, agricultural production and trading, and marriage. Brokpa owe the land and staple food to Unpa, and Unpa instead obtain the cheese and butter which are important protein source for them.

40|$|The {{effect of}} three tillage {{implements}} (<b>field</b> <b>cultivator,</b> disk harrow, rotary harrow) {{on the soil}} incorporation of various herbicides and consequently on the efficacy of these herbicides against the weeds and on their selectivity on cotton, was evaluated in four field experiments conducted in Northern Greece during 2003 and 2004. All experimental plots were irrigated with sprinklers, immediately after the pre-emergence application of herbicides, while later all plots were irrigated with either drip irrigation or mobile sprinklers. The herbicide treatments consisted of a broadcast preplant-incorporated (PPI) application of s-metolachlor or trifluralin followed by pre-emergence (PRE) applied prometryn, a pre-emergence 38 cm band application of s-metolachlor + fluometuron and a broadcast PPI application of s-metolachlor followed by post-emergence applied trifloxysulfuron-sodium or pyrithiobac. The PPI application of s-metolachlor or trifluralin followed by PRE application of prometryn resulted the greatest control of redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) and black nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.). The efficacy of herbicides against common lambsquarters and black nightshade was slightly reduced when they were incorporated into the soil with the rotary harrow. Cotton plant emergence, number of bolls, boll opening and cotton lint yield were not affected in most cases by the tillage implement. Cotton lint yield in plots irrigated with drip irrigation was higher or equal with plots irrigated with sprinklers. The effect of three tillage implements (<b>field</b> <b>cultivator,</b> disk harrow, rotary harrow) and various herbicides was also evaluated in two field experiments conducted in Northern Greece during 2006 and 2007. Herbicide treatments included the pre-plant incorporation of s-metolachlor + fluometuron, trifluralin + fluometuron, ethalfluralin, pendimethalin + fluometuron, fluometuron. Irrigation with sprinklers was not made after cotton sowing. Cotton lint yield in plots treated with preplant incorporated s-metolachlor + fluometuron was equal to plots treated with trifluralin + fluometuron or pendimethalin + fluometuron, but significantly higher than plots treated with ethalfluralin or fluometuron. The incorporation of herbicides in the soil with disk harrow or <b>field</b> <b>cultivator</b> compared to rotary harrow, provided higher efficacy against some weeds and similar effect on cotton plant emergence, number of bolls, bolls opening and cotton lint yield. In addition, the fossil-fuel and labor time requirements of disk harrow and <b>field</b> <b>cultivator</b> were {{lower than that of}} rotary harrow. The findings of this study showed that the herbicides trifluralin, s-metolachlor or pendimethalin in tank mix with fluometuron or prometryn should be used for effective control of broad leaved weeds in cotton.

40|$|If 2 ̆ 2 tillage 2 ̆ 2 {{is defined}} as the {{mechanical}} manipulation of soil, it follows, then, that a 2 ̆ 2 tillage system 2 ̆ 2 would be the sequence of soil-manipulation operations performed in producing a crop. Today, however, such a definition is recognized as inadequate. We know, for instance, that the management of non-harvested plant tissue (i. e., residue) affects both crop production and soil erosion, and that field operations in which the soil is not tilled have a marked influence on soil condition. Therefore, in this publication, a tillage system is the sequence of all operations involved in producing the crop, including soil manipulation, harvesting, chopping or shredding of residue, application of pesticides and fertilizers, etc. But before describing and comparing the various tillage systems for corn, some terminologies and possible points of confusion need to be addressed. These have to do with primary vs. secondary tillage and the different ways in which similar tillage systems could be defined. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY TILLAGE For many tillage systems, the specific operations can be separated into 2 ̆ 2 primary 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 secondary. 2 ̆ 2 Primary tillage loosens and fractures the soil to reduce soil strength and to bring or mix residues and fertilizers into the tilled layer. The implements (2 ̆ 2 tools 2 ̆ 2) used for primary tillage include moldboard, chisel and disk plows; heavy tandem, offset and one -way disks; subsoilers; and heavy -duty, powered rotary tillers. These tools usually operate deeper and produce a rougher soil surface than do secondary tillage tools; however, they differ from each other as to amount of soil manipulation and amount of residue left on or near the surface. Secondary tillage is used to kill weeds, cut and cover crop residue, incorporate herbicides and prepare a seedbed. The tools include light- and medium -weight disks, <b>field</b> <b>cultivators,</b> rotary hoes, drags, powered and unpowered harrows and rotary tillers, rollers, ridge- or bed -forming implements, and numerous variations or combinations of these.

The relationship of implement draft to soil and implement geometric parameters need to be precisely developed to predict the tillage effect of soil properties. ^ The TRI, tandem disk, chisel plow and <b>field</b> <b>cultivator</b> drafts, vertical forces and torques were significantly affected by the tillage depths and travel speeds. The draft, vertical force and torque models for the implements and TRI were related as a quadratic of tillage depth. ^ A microprocessor based non-contact ultrasonic sensor was used to measure tillage depths.

It performed well on concrete and double disked surfaces and the measured values gave coefficient of variation lower than 10 % on concrete and double disked surfaces. The precise measurements of tillage depths in the double disked surfaces were used in developing the draft model. ^ To adjust the soil scale factors for variations in soil parameters within a given soil type, a soil cone index was used as a covariate in the draft models. The effects of soil moisture content and bulk density on the cone index values were normalized using covariate analysis technique. The technique allowed treatments comparison at same and across depths. Cone index models for wheat stubble and double disked surfaces were developed based on soil depth, moisture content and bulk density.

Fallow weed management systems were conventional tillage, chemical-fallow (herbicide application), and sheep grazing. The crop rotations were summer fallow–spring wheat and summer fallow–winter wheat. In late fall, chemical-fallow treatment had greater residue cover and soil water content than did tilled- or grazed-fallow. At 0 – 15 -cm depth, soil had lower bulk density in chemical- and tilled-fallow than in grazed fallow. Similarly, soil NO 3 -N, Ca, SO 4 -S concentrations and EC were lower following grazed-fallow than tilled-fallow, but Na concentration was higher following grazed-fallow than tilled- or chemical-fallow. Following spring and winter wheat, soil properties were not influenced by treatments. Grain yield was greater in winter wheat than in spring wheat but the trend reversed in protein concentration. Although soil properties varied among treatments, fallow management system had little influence on yield or quality of spring and winter wheat. Sheep grazing during fallow periods had limited impact on subsequent wheat yield and quality, and is a suitable practice for weed and residue management in wheat–fallow systems...|$|E
40|$|Microbial {{diversity}} {{can be used}} {{to assess}} the impact of agricultural practices on the long-term sustainability of cropping systems. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in soil bacterial diversity as a result of the impact of different soil tillage and crop rotation systems in an oxisol of southern Brazil. Bacterial diversity was examined in the 0 - 10 cm layer in two field experiments by analyzing soil DNA using 16 S rDNA-DGGE profiles. Experiment one consisted of a long-term 26 -year trial with four soil tillage management systems: (1) no-tillage (NT), (2) disc plow (DP), (3) <b>field</b> <b>cultivator</b> (FC), and (4) heavy-disc harrow (DH), all under soybean (summer) /wheat (winter) crop succession. Experiment two consisted of a short-term 10 -year trial with DP and NT and three crop rotations (CR) including grasses, legumes and green manures. Cluster analysis of the 16 S rDNA sequences revealed that the main effect on clustering was attributed to differences in soil tillage management systems. The Shannon index confirmed greater bacterial diversity under NT, followed by the FC, DH and DP. Therefore, diversity decreased as tillage practices intensified. The evenness index demonstrated uniformity of the profiles of the bacterial communities, with dominance of a few communities, regardless of soil tillage and crop rotation. Different crop rotations had only minor effects on bacterial diversity, what could be related to a previous fallow period. The results suggest that bacterial diversity analyzed by DGGE may be useful as bioindicator of the changes caused by soil tillage. 201...|$|E
40|$|Identical field {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} 2014 and 2015 in Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee, Wisconsin and at two sites in Missouri {{to determine the effects}} of four tillage treatments combined with one of two herbicide programs on season long emergence of Amaranthus species in glufosinate-resistant soybean. The tillage systems evaluated were deep tillage (fall moldboard plow fb one pass with a <b>field</b> <b>cultivator</b> in the spring), conventional tillage (fall chisel plow fb one pass with a <b>field</b> <b>cultivator</b> in the spring), minimum tillage (one pass of a vertical tillage tool in the spring), and a no-tillage treatment (burndown application of paraquat (0. 84 kg ai/ha) at approximately the same time as the spring tillage). Each tillage system also received one of two herbicide programs; PRE application of flumioxaxin (0. 09 kg ai/ha) fb a POST application of glufosinate (0. 59 kg ai/ha) plus S-metolachlor (1. 39 kg ai/ha), or POST-only applications of glufosinate (0. 59 kg ai/ha). The deep tillage system resulted in a 62, 67, and 73 % reduction in Amaranthus emergence when compared to the conventional, minimum, and no-tillage systems, respectively. The residual herbicide program also resulted in an 87 % reduction in Amaranthus species emergence compared to the POST-only program. The deep tillage system, combined with the residual program, resulted in a 97 % reduction in Amaranthus species emergence when compared to the minimum tillage system combined with the POST-only program, which had the highest Amaranthus emergence. Soil cores taken prior to planting and herbicide application revealed that only 28 % of the Amaranthus seed in the deep tillage system was placed within the top 5 -cm of the soil profile compared to 79, 81, and 77 % in the conventional, minimum and no-tillage systems. Overall, the use of deep tillage with a residual herbicide program provided the greatest reduction in Amaranthus species emergence, thus providing a useful tool in managing herbicide resistant Amaranthus species where appropriate. Migratory waterfowl have often been implicated in the movement of troublesome agronomic weed species. Previous research has shown that waterfowl have the ability to transport wetland weed species. However, little to no research has been conducted to investigate the long-distance dispersal of agronomically important weed species such as Palmer amaranth and waterhemp. Thus, two objectives were set forth for this research project: 1) to determine what weed species are being transported throughout Missouri by ducks and snow geese, and 2) to determine the recovery rate and viability of 13 agronomic weed species after passage through a duck's digestive system. A field collection experiment was conducted with ducks harvested in the fall and winter of 2014 - 15 and 2015 - 16 and geese harvested in March of 2015. Seed recovered from the digestive tracts of the 238 birds harvested in the first duck season had 14, 395 plants emerge, representing 47 species with the three most common being barnyardgrass (38 %), waterhemp (30 %), and smartweed species (24 %). The 125 birds collected in the second duck season had 19, 337 plants emerge, representing 28 species with the three most common being smartweed species (90 %), common ragweed (3 %), and barnyardgrass (3 %). The 111 geese harvested in March 2015 had 87 plants emerge, representing 11 species with the three most common being field corn (45 %), smartweed species (31 %), and waterhemp (8 %). From the 13 agronomically-important weed species fed to mallards in the controlled feeding study, 11 species were recovered and at least 1 seed from each of those species was still viable. Recovery rate ranged from 30 % for common lambsquarters to 0 % for yellow nutsedge tubers and common sunflower. Seed mass and size had a negative correlation to percent recovered intact seed and percent recovered viable seed, while seed neutral detergent fiber content had a positive correlation. Calculations from the viability rate and gut retention times identified in this research indicate that all of the 11 species recovered have the potential to be dispersed up to 312 km while Palmer amaranth, waterhemp and common lambsquarters have the potential to be dispersed up to 2964 km from the source location. The results of this study confirm that waterfowl are consuming a variety of agronomically-important weed species which can remain viable after passage through their digestive tracts and can be dispersed over long distances...|$|E
40|$|More {{and more}} studies, {{including}} in Brazil, have suggested {{the use of}} microbial biomass carbon (MBC) as a bioindicator of soil quality. Most studies employ two methods: the pioneer of fumigation-incubation (FI), in which the MBC is estimated based on CO 2 emission from fumigated and non-fumigated soil samples after 10 days of incubation and fumigationextraction (FE), in which MBC is estimated based on C extraction from fumigated and nonfumigated soil samples after 12 h. However, in Brazil the correlation between both methods has been evaluated in three ecosystems only: in the Amazon, the Cerrado and three soils of the State of Rio de Janeiro. In this paper the methods FE and FI were compared in a typical Dark Red Oxisol in the North of Paraná State. The analyses were performed in a 12 year- Geld trial in Londrina with six treatments, including three soU managements (no-tillage, NT; conventional tillage with traditional ploughing and disking, CT; and NT using a <b>field</b> <b>cultivator</b> every three years, FC) and two crop management types (crop rotation, CR; or multiple cropping, MC) systems. Four soil samples (0 - 10 cm) were taken: after winter harvest (wheat in CR and lupin in MC), after summer ploughing (for CT and FC treatments), after summer sowing (soybean in CR and maize in MC) and in the summer crop flowering stage. In general the variability was low by both methods and the coefficient of variation washigher, the lower the MBC values. No differences between the FE and FI methods were detected when the four samplings at different stages as well as when all treatments were considered together. When all treatments were analyzed together, the correlation between FE and FI was positive and statistically significant. However, when each treatment was considered separately significance was observed for the treatments NT and CT in CR and MC, but not for FC. Results indicate that both methods {{may be used to}} evaluate MBC under similar conditions in Northern Paraná, however, they also indicate that more studies should be performed in Brazilian soils comparing both methods as a function of qualitative and quantitative changes in the organic matter contents {{as well as in the}} incorporation of crop residues...|$|E
40|$|Selecting the tillage system {{best suited}} to a {{particular}} farming situation is an important management decision. Formerly, the traditional system was a moldboard plow operation followed by several secondary tillage operations before planting. This system can be appropriate for poorly drained soils having little or no slope and low erosion potential. However, plowing has several disadvantages. The potential for soil erosion is high on sloping lands, and labor and fuel requirements can be substantially higher than with other tillage and planting systems. Today, conservation tillage systems are used to reduce preplant tillage operations, thus reducing soil erosion and moisture loss while saving labor and fuel. The label 2 ̆ 2 conservation tillage 2 ̆ 2 represents {{a broad spectrum of}} farming methods, and is most often defined by the amount of residue cover remaining on the soil surface. The minimum amount recommended is 20 to 30 percent after planting. Research in Nebraska and other Midwestern states has shown that leaving at least this much residue will reduce erosion by more than 50 percent of that occurring from a cleanly tilled field. To achieve effective erosion control, this minimum residue cover should be maintained during the critical soil erosion period between spring seedbed preparation and crop canopy establishment. Conservation tillage does not necessarily require new equipment. Most conventional farm implements can be used. For corn, grain sorghum, or wheat residue, one or two passes with a <b>field</b> <b>cultivator,</b> disk, or chisel plow will usually leave more than the 20 percent minimum cover. Additional operations reduce the amount of residue, and thus reduce erosion control. Other tillage and planting systems such as ridge-plant (till-plant) and no till leave even more residue, and thus offer greater erosion control. However, no-till planting is the only method that consistently leaves the minimum surface cover in the more fragile and less abundant soybean residue. No single tillage system is best for all situations at all times. Selecting the best tillage system for a particular soil and cropping situation requires matching the operation to the crop sequence, topography, and soil type. Rotating systems to coincide with crop rotations often provides an excellent combination. For example, a no till system could follow soybeans while a chisel or disk system might follow corn. This tillage rotation provides the best erosion control following soybeans, and provides an opportunity for some tillage in the less fragile and more abundant corn residue...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of AgronomyDallas E. PetersonDuring 2015 and 2016, five site {{years of}} {{research}} were implemented in double crop soybean after winter wheat at experiment fields in Kansas near Manhattan, Hutchinson, and Ottawa to assess various non-glyphosate herbicide treatments at three different application timings for control of Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Wats.) and common waterhemp (Amaranthus rudis Sauer). Spring-post (SP) treatments with residual control of Palmer amaranth and waterhemp were applied in the winter wheat at Feekes 4 and resulted in less than 50 % control of Palmer amaranth and waterhemp {{at the time of}} double crop soybean planting. Pre-harvest treatments were applied two weeks before winter wheat harvest. 2, 4 -D resulted in highly variable Palmer amaranth and waterhemp control whereas flumioxazin resulted in comparable control to PRE treatments that contained paraquat plus a residual herbicide. Excellent Palmer amaranth and waterhemp control was observed at 1 week after planting (WAP) double crop soybean with a preemergence (PRE) paraquat application; however, reduced control of Palmer amaranth and waterhemp was noted at 8 WAP due to extended emergence. Palmer amaranth and waterhemp control was 85 % or greater at 8 WAP for most PRE treatments that included a combination of paraquat plus residual herbicides. PRE treatments that did not include the combination of paraquat and residual herbicides did not provide acceptable control. A second set of field experiments were established in 2015 and 2016 near Manhattan, Hutchinson, and Ottawa to assess residual Palmer amaranth and waterhemp control with very-long-chain-fatty acid (VLFCA) inhibiting herbicides. Acetochlor (non-encapsulated and encapsulated), alachlor, dimethenamid-P, metolachlor, S-metolachlor, and pyroxasulfone as well as the microtubule inhibiting herbicide pendimethalin were applied at three different field use rates (high, middle, and low) based on labeled rate ranges for soybean as PRE treatments in a non-crop scenario after the plot was clean tilled with a <b>field</b> <b>cultivator.</b> The experiment was conducted one time in 2015 and four times in 2016 at two different locations for a total of five site years of data. PRE applications were made June 1, 2015, near Manhattan. PRE applications in 2016 were made in April at locations near Hutchinson and Ottawa; the second run of the experiment was applied in June at the same locations on a different set of plot areas. At Manhattan pyroxasulfone, S-metolachlor, and dimethenamid-P resulted in the highest Palmer amaranth control at 4 WAT. At Hutchinson, pyroxasulfone resulted in superior Palmer amaranth control compared to dimethenamid-P and pendimethalin at 4 WAT and 8 WAT. At Ottawa, acetochlor, S-metolachlor, and pyroxasulfone resulted in higher waterhemp control than alachlor and pendimethalin at 4 WAT and 8 WAT...|$|E
