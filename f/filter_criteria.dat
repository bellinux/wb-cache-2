40|$|Abstract Background In proteomic analysis, MS/MS spectra {{acquired}} by mass spectrometer {{are assigned to}} peptides by database searching algorithms such as SEQUEST. The assignations of peptides to MS/MS spectra by SEQUEST searching algorithm are defined by several scores including Xcorr, ΔCn, Sp, Rsp, matched ion count and so on. <b>Filtering</b> <b>criterion</b> using several above scores is used to isolate correct identifications from random assignments. However, the <b>filtering</b> <b>criterion</b> was not favorably optimized up to now. Results In this study, we implemented a machine learning approach known as predictive genetic algorithm (GA) for the optimization of <b>filtering</b> <b>criteria</b> to maximize the number of identified peptides at fixed false-discovery rate (FDR) for SEQUEST database searching. As the FDR was directly determined by decoy database search scheme, the GA based optimization approach did not require any pre-knowledge {{on the characteristics of}} the data set, which represented significant advantages over statistical approaches such as PeptideProphet. Compared with PeptideProphet, the GA based approach can achieve similar performance in distinguishing true from false assignment with only 1 / 10 of the processing time. Moreover, the GA based approach can be easily extended to process other database search results as it did not rely on any assumption on the data. Conclusion Our results indicated that <b>filtering</b> <b>criteria</b> should be optimized individually for different samples. The new developed software using GA provides a convenient and fast way to create tailored optimal criteria for different proteome samples to improve proteome coverage. </p...|$|R

5000|$|Applying this access {{strategy}} to B-tree indexes can also combine range queries on multiple columns.

After all conditions are evaluated, the bitmap contains a [...] "1" [...] for rows that matched the expression. Finally, the bitmap is traversed and matching rows are retrieved. In addition to efficiently combining indexes, this also improves locality of reference of table accesses, because all rows are fetched sequentially from the main table. The internal bitmap is discarded after the query. If {{there are too many}} rows in the table to use 1 bit per row, a [...] "lossy" [...] bitmap is created instead, with a single bit per disk page.

40|$|Abstract—The {{objective}} of the beamforming with the exploita-tion of a sensor array is to enhance the signals of the sources from desired directions, suppress the noises and the interfering signals from other directions, and/or simultaneously provide the localization of the associated sources. In this paper, we present a higher order cumulant-based beamforming algorithm, namely, the super-exponential blind adaptive beamforming algorithm, which is extended from the super-exponential algorithm (SEA) and the inverse <b>filter</b> <b>criteria</b> (IFC). While both SEA and IFC assume noise-free conditions, this requirement is no longer needed, and all the noise components {{are taken into account}} in the proposed algorithm. Two special conditions are derived under which the proposed blind beamforming algorithm achieves the performance of the corresponding optimal nonblind beamformer in the sense of minimum mean square error (MMSE). Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is effective and robust to diverse initial weight vectors; its performance {{with the use of the}} fourth-order cumulants is close to that of the nonblind optimal MMSE beamformer.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} novel news {{filtering}} model based on flexible and soft <b>filtering</b> <b>criteria</b> and exploiting a fuzzy hierarchical categorization of news. The filtering module {{is designed to provide}} news professionals and general users with an interactive and personalised tool for news gathering and delivery. It exploits content-based <b>filtering</b> <b>criteria</b> and category-based <b>filtering</b> techniques to deliver to the user a ranked list of either news or clusters of news. In fact, if the user prefers to have a synthetic view of the topics of recent news pushed by the stream, the system filters groups (clusters) of news having homogenous contents, identified automatically by the application of a fuzzy clustering algorithm that organizes the recent news into a fuzzy hierarchy. The filter can be trained explicitly by the user to learn his/her interests as well as implicitly by monitoring his/her interaction with the system. Several <b>filtering</b> <b>criteria</b> can be applied to select and rank news to the users based on the user’s information preferences and presentation preferences. User preferences specify what information (the contents of interest) is relevant to the user, the sources that provide reliable information, and the period of time during which the information remains relevant. Each individual news or cluster of news homogeneous with respect to their content is selected based on a customizable multi criteria decision making approach and ranked based on a combination of criteria specified by the user in his/her presentation preferences. ...|$|R

In this paper, we study the effect of different combinations for these factors on the im-pact of {{the accuracy of the}} query results in the proposed technique for bug localization. Bugs of three real-world software systems were analyzed with different combinations of input parameters for the LSA technique. Our results suggest that the term-document matrix transformations and <b>filtering</b> <b>criteria</b> of the corpus have major influence in the quality of the result and that the combination of adequate individual parameter val-ues does not necessarily produce the best combination. Furthermore, some general guidance for parameterization of the LSA technique for bug localization could also be suggested from the observed results. ...|$|R

Most systems built so far use multiple access methods although they compose them according to a pre-defined strategy. In this paper we report an environment that allows the evaluation of different type of filtering composition strategies. The aim is to let the developers work with a quick tool for fine tuning of sequences or compositions of methods, especially when such methods are based on different features. The selectivity of each indexing method is tested against a single database of images and then the overall performance of a sequence or a composition of methods is quickly estimated. The experiments have been applied on <b>filtering</b> <b>criteria</b> that share a multiresolution approach, in order to highlight the role that the hierarchical indexing approach can play in reducing the overall computational cost. ...|$|R
40|$|CpG {{islands are}} genome subsequences with an {{unexpectedly}} {{high number of}} CG di-nucleotides. They are typically identified using <b>filtering</b> <b>criteria</b> (e. g., G+C% expected vs. observed CpG ratio and length) and are computed using sliding window methods. Most such studies illusively assume an exhaustive search of CpG islands are achieved on the genome sequence of interest. We devise a Lexis diagram and explicitly show that filtering criteria-based definitions of CpG islands are mathematically incomplete and non-operational. These facts imply that the sliding window methods frequently fail to identify {{a large percentage of}} subsequences that meet the <b>filtering</b> <b>criteria.</b> We also demonstrate that an exhaustive search is computationally expensive. We develop the Hierarchical Factor Segmentation (HFS) algorithm, a pattern recognition technique with an adaptive model selection device to overcome the incompleteness and non-operational drawbacks, and to achieve effective computations for identifying CpG-islands. The concept of a CpG island “core” is introduced and computed using the HFS algorithm, which is independent from any specific <b>filtering</b> <b>criteria.</b> Upon such a CpG island “core,” a CpG-island is constructed using a Lexis diagram. This two-step computational approach provides a nearly exhaustive search for CpG islands that can be practically implemented on whole chromosomes. In a simulation study realistically mimicking CpG-island dynamics through a Hidden Markov Model we demonstrate that this approach retains very high sensitivity and specificity, that is, very low rates of false positives and false negatives. Finally, we apply the HFS algorithm to identify CpG island cores on human chromosome 21...|$|R
