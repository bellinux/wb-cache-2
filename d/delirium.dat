5|$|Antipsychotics are {{generally}} a first-line treatment for delirium; however, when <b>delirium</b> {{is caused by}} alcohol or sedative hypnotic withdrawal, benzodiazepines are a first-line treatment.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are the {{preferred}} {{choice in the}} management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, in particular, for the prevention and treatment of the dangerous complication of seizures and in subduing severe <b>delirium.</b> Lorazepam is the only benzodiazepine with predictable intramuscular absorption and it is the most effective in preventing and controlling acute seizures.|$|E
50|$|Each tale is stylistically different, and {{illustrated}} by a different artist. Most of the tales are independent of each other; however Destruction's tale relates to and immediately follows <b>Delirium's.</b> Destruction and <b>Delirium's</b> tales {{are the only ones}} that take place after the events of the Sandman series.|$|R

5|$|His {{return to}} {{football}} was successful {{enough that he}} signed for Chelmsford City in the Southern League for the 1976–77 season. He played {{for only a few}} months with Chelmsford. He was still struggling with alcoholism and <b>delirium</b> tremens and sought out help from Alcoholics Anonymous. He was also hospitalised in the alcoholics' ward of Warley Psychiatric Hospital.|$|E
5|$|More global {{behavioural}} abnormalities may be noted, {{such as an}} increase in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor agitation or hyperactivity) which might reflect mania or <b>delirium.</b> An inability to sit still might represent akathisia, {{a side effect of}} antipsychotic medication. Similarly, a global decrease in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor retardation, akinesia or stupor) might indicate depression or a medical condition such as Parkinson's disease, dementia or <b>delirium.</b> The examiner would also comment on eye movements (repeatedly glancing to one side can suggest that the patient is experiencing hallucinations), and the quality of eye contact (which can provide clues to the patient's emotional state). Lack of eye contact may suggest depression or autism.|$|E
5|$|On 16 March 1996, a Gambian asylum seeker, Ibrahima Sey, {{was taken}} to Ilford Police Station in east London. Whilst incapacitating Sey, who was {{suffering}} from excited <b>delirium,</b> police sprayed him with CS spray and held him {{on the ground for}} approximately 15 minutes, and he subsequently died.|$|E

5|$|Symptoms from {{exposure}} to organic lead, which is probably more toxic than inorganic lead due to its lipid solubility, occur rapidly. Poisoning by organic lead compounds has symptoms predominantly in the central nervous system, such as insomnia, <b>delirium,</b> cognitive deficits, tremor, hallucinations, and convulsions.|$|E
5|$|The most {{frequent}} symptoms of withdrawal from benzodiazepines are insomnia, gastric problems, tremors, agitation, fearfulness, and muscle spasms. The less frequent effects are irritability, sweating, depersonalization, derealization, hypersensitivity to stimuli, depression, suicidal behavior, psychosis, seizures, and <b>delirium</b> tremens. Severe symptoms usually {{occur as a}} result of abrupt or over-rapid withdrawal. Abrupt withdrawal can be dangerous, therefore a gradual reduction regimen is recommended.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{discontinuation}} of serotonergic drugs, {{most cases}} of serotonin syndrome resolve within 24 hours, although {{in some cases}} <b>delirium</b> may persist {{for a number of}} days. Symptoms typically persist for a longer time frame in patients taking drugs which have a long elimination half-life, active metabolites, or a protracted duration of action.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{their return}} on Oct 24, 1871, Hall {{suddenly}} fell ill after drinking {{a cup of}} coffee. His symptoms started with an upset stomach, then progressed to vomiting and <b>delirium</b> the following day. Hall accused several of the ship's company, including Bessels, of having poisoned him. Following these accusations, he refused medical treatment from Bessels, and drank only liquids delivered directly by his Inuit friend Tookoolito. He seemed to improve for a few days, and was even able to go up on deck. Bessels had prevailed upon Bryan, the ship's chaplain, to convince Hall to allow the doctor to see him. By November 4, Hall relented, and Bessels resumed treatment. Shortly after, Hall's condition began to deteriorate, and he suffered vomiting and <b>delirium,</b> and collapsed. Bessels diagnosed apoplexy, and Hall finally died on November 8. He was taken ashore and given a formal burial.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is still}} {{commonly}} parboiled before preparation, evidence suggests that even this procedure may not make Gyromitra esculenta entirely safe for consumption. When consumed, the principal active agent, gyromitrin, is hydrolyzed into the toxic compound monomethylhydrazine (MMH). The toxin affects the liver, central nervous system, and sometimes the kidneys. Symptoms of poisoning involve vomiting and diarrhea several hours after consumption, followed by dizziness, lethargy and headache. Severe cases may lead to <b>delirium,</b> coma and death after five to seven days.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{conditions}} that inhibit consciousness are considered disorders of consciousness. This category generally includes minimally conscious state and persistent vegetative state, but sometimes {{also includes the}} less severe locked-in syndrome and more severe chronic coma. Differential diagnosis of these disorders is an active area of biomedical research. Finally, brain death results in an irreversible disruption of consciousness. While other conditions may cause a moderate deterioration (e.g., dementia and <b>delirium)</b> or transient interruption (e.g., grand mal and petit mal seizures) of consciousness, they {{are not included in}} this category.|$|E
60|$|Indeed, {{considering}} the <b>deliriums</b> which the agony threw people into, and how I have mentioned in their madness, {{when they were}} alone, they did many desperate things, it was very strange {{there were no more}} disasters of that kind.|$|R
50|$|The Little Endless Storybook is {{a picture}} book by Jill Thompson {{published}} by the Vertigo imprint of DC Comics. It features the popular Endless characters from Neil Gaiman's The Sandman comic book reimagined as toddlers. A second Little Endless Storybook, titled <b>Delirium's</b> Party, was released in 2011.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{most other}} Cirque du Soleil shows, where the musicians are {{situated}} {{to the sides}} or the far upstage area and are frequently hidden from view, <b>Deliriums</b> six musicians were often in plain view, and could be seen interacting with the other performers and various stage elements.|$|R
5|$|Mild {{impairment}} {{of attention and}} concentration may occur in any mental illness where people are anxious and distractible (including psychotic states), but more extensive cognitive abnormalities are likely to indicate a gross disturbance of brain functioning such as <b>delirium,</b> dementia or intoxication. Specific language abnormalities {{may be associated with}} pathology in Wernicke's area or Broca's area of the brain. In Korsakoff's syndrome there is dramatic memory impairment with relative preservation of other cognitive functions.|$|E
5|$|Sunset Overdrive is an action-adventure game {{set in a}} third-person perspective. Players {{navigate}} a metropolis called Sunset City in {{the year}} 2027. This dystopian world has been overrun by mutants called the OD, short for Overcharge Drinkers. The player character is a former FizzCo employee, tasked with cleaning up the mess left behind from a party FizzCo had thrown to celebrate the launch of its new energy drink, Overcharge <b>Delirium</b> XT.|$|E
5|$|Supplemental testing {{provides}} extra {{information on}} some {{features of the}} disease or is used to rule out other diagnoses. Blood tests can identify other causes for dementia than AD—causes which may, in rare cases, be reversible. It is common to perform thyroid function tests, assess B12, rule out syphilis, rule out metabolic problems (including tests for kidney function, electrolyte levels and for diabetes), assess levels of heavy metals (e.g. lead, mercury) and anaemia. (It is also necessary to rule out <b>delirium).</b>|$|E
5000|$|In <b>Delirium's</b> {{story in}} Endless Nights, [...] "Going Inside", she has retreated into her realm so deeply {{that no one}} can {{retrieve}} her, save five insane human individuals gathered together by Daniel, Matthew and Barnabas, as only those who are already deeply insane can enter her realm unscathed.|$|R
50|$|<b>Deliriums</b> {{stage was}} {{set up on the}} arena floor, {{bisecting}} it lengthwise. Its two-sided, raised stage allowed for an alley theater-style presentation: the audience sat {{on both sides of the}} stage, at times able to look over the central stage to see the spectators on the other side. This presented unique staging challenges in that the most important actions had to be visible to both sides of the audience. However, the show could also be presented as a proscenium show, with the seats on one side of the arena left empty. In this case, the stage {{was set up}} closer to the sideline opposite the occupied seats, opening up a portion of the arena floor for additional seating. Despite the extraordinary complexity and size of <b>Deliriums</b> stage, it could be assembled inside an arena in approximately nine hours.|$|R
5000|$|Original {{music for}} the film was scored by Alex Heffes. The climbers reach the summit to the climax of Thomas Tallis's Spem in alium. During one of Simpson's many <b>deliriums,</b> he {{experiences}} a very strong reminiscence of a Boney M song he hated thoroughly, [...] "Brown Girl in the Ring"; at one point thinking [...] "Bloody hell, I'm going to die to Boney M".|$|R
5|$|The first {{description}} of thrombosis of the cerebral veins and sinuses {{is attributed to}} the French physician Ribes, who in 1825 observed thrombosis of the saggital sinus and cerebral veins in {{a man who had}} suffered from seizures and <b>delirium.</b> Until {{the second half of the}} 20th century it remained a diagnosis generally made after death. In the 1940s, reports by Dr Charles Symonds and others allowed for the clinical diagnosis of cerebral venous thrombosis, using characteristic signs and symptoms and results of lumbar puncture.|$|E
5|$|Those {{taking more}} than 4mg per day have an {{increased}} potential for dependence. This medication may cause withdrawal symptoms upon abrupt withdrawal or rapid tapering, which in some cases {{have been known to}} cause seizures, as well as marked <b>delirium</b> similar to that produced by the anticholinergic tropane alkaloids of Datura (scopolamine and atropine). The discontinuation of this medication may also cause a reaction called rebound anxiety.|$|E
5|$|When young, it may {{be mistaken}} for the edible St George's {{mushroom}} (Calocybe gambosa) or the miller (Clitopilus prunulus). It {{has been responsible for}} many cases of mushroom poisoning in Europe. E.sinuatum causes primarily gastrointestinal problems that, though not generally life-threatening, have been described as highly unpleasant. <b>Delirium</b> and depression are uncommon sequelae. It is generally not considered to be lethal, although one source has reported deaths from the consumption of this mushroom.|$|E
50|$|During the demon's age, {{when the}} planet was still flat, Azhriaz, {{daughter}} of Azhrarn, Demon Lord of the Night and a mortal was hidden on an isle surrounded by mist and her spirit was protected {{to live forever}} in dreams. But Azhriaz destiny {{was about to change}} unexpectedly. Her powerful energy and beauty attracted Azhrarn’s enemy, Prince Chuz, who created a spell to free Azhriaz from her confinement and convert her into the <b>Delirium’s</b> Mistress.|$|R
50|$|The escapism and the {{denunciation}} of the bourgeois society are complementary aspects of an ambivalent attitude. The plastic {{writers and artists}} agreed in the negation, and even an officially conservative man like Antonio Gaudí projected in unusual architectures his escapist <b>deliriums</b> (arabicism of the Vicens House, in Barcelona, or purified gothicism of the Episcopal Palace of Astorga). Indigenism and exotism were not negative attitudes: they implied the affirmation of the inhabitable world; even more, of myths in which close truths of universal validity were declared.|$|R
60|$|This Engine {{prevents}} {{all sorts}} of Lunacies, Love-Frenzies, and Melancholy-Madness, for preserving the Thought in right Lines to direct Objects, it is impossible any <b>Deliriums,</b> Whimsies, or fluttering Air of Ideas, can interrupt the Man, he can never be Mad; for which reason I cannot but recommend it to my Lord S---, my Lord N---, and my Lord H-----, as absolutely necesssary to defend them from the State-Madness, which for some Ages has possest their Families, and which runs {{too much in the}} Blood.|$|R
