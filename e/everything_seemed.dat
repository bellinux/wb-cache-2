The Save FNL Campaign raised a total of $15,840 for 18,750 footballs, $2061 for charity, and $924 worth of DVDs for troops stationed overseas.|$|E

25|$|At the EuroBasket 1999, Alvertis {{seemed ready}} to lead Greece to its first medal since 1989. After leading the team in offense, with 18.1 points per game in the {{qualifying}} round, <b>everything</b> <b>seemed</b> to indicate a great EuroBasket for the Greek star. Nevertheless, misfortune {{is part of the}} game of basketball. A few days before the tournament, Alvertis suffered a severe injury during practice. This injury made him not only miss the EuroBasket, but also the major part of the Panathinaikos 1999–2000 season. Without its offensive leader, and also without Nikos Oikonomou and Efthimios Rentzias, who were also injured, Greece finished in an embarrassing sixteenth and last position. Greece failed to qualify for the 2000 Summer Olympics of course, and was doomed to two years of exclusion from every major tournament.|$|E
25|$|Difficulties were {{addressed}} throughout 1964 and 1965 at Groom Lake with various technical issues. Captive flights showed unforeseen aerodynamic difficulties. By late January 1966, {{more than a}} year after the first captive flight, <b>everything</b> <b>seemed</b> ready. The first D-21 launch was made on 5 March 1966 with a successful flight, with the D-21 flying 120 miles with limited fuel. A second D-12 flight was successful in April 1966 with the drone flying 1,200 miles, reaching Mach 3.3 and 90,000 feet. An accident on 30 July 1966 with a fully fueled D-21, on a planned checkout flight suffered from a non-start of the drone after its separation, causing it to collide with the M-21 launch aircraft. The two crewmen ejected and landed in the ocean 150 miles offshore. One crew member was picked up by a helicopter, but the other, having survived the aircraft breakup and ejection, drowned when sea water entered his pressure suit. Kelly Johnson personally cancelled the entire program, having had serious doubts from the start of the feasibility. A number of D-21s had already been produced, and rather than scrapping the whole effort, Johnson again proposed to the Air Force that they be launched from a B-52H bomber.|$|E
25|$|During the 1993/94 {{international}} season, Wessels' cricketing career reached full circle, as he captained the South African {{side in a}} tour to Australia. The first Test {{match of}} the tour, in Melbourne, was drawn. The second, and arguably most memorable, test was played {{out in front of}} a capacity crowd in Sydney. It turned out to be Wessels' last match of the tour, following a hand injury during play. Shane Warne took seven wickets in the first innings and <b>everything</b> <b>seemed</b> lost for the South Africans. However, thanks to some heroic bowling and batting by the visitors, Australia was eventually set a winning target of 117 runs in the second innings. The home side was bowled out for 110 runs, and South Africa won their first Test match against Australia since 1969. Wessels was forced to return to South Africa because of his injury, thus missing out {{on the rest of the}} tour. He was, however, immediately reinstated as captain for the home series against Australia. The series was drawn 1–1, and Wessels was criticised for 'baffling' captaincy in the final Test by failing to declare and allowing the tail to score slowly when South Africa seemed to be in a position to win the match and the series.|$|E

25|$|Although {{she was not}} as {{dominant}} as she {{had been}} in 1994 and 1995, Sonia O'Sullivan continued to be a major force in 1996 at the distances between 1500 m and 5000 m. Her best event in 1996 was the 3000 m, where she was unbeaten for the third successive year, winning all five of her races. O'Sullivan produced the early season leading time of 8:42.40 in Eugene on 26 May, and then at Nice, on 10 July, she recorded the year's fastest time of 8:35.42. In the 1500 m, only two women broke 4 minutes during the year, one of whom was O'Sullivan, who clocked her best time of 3:59.91 when winning at the Bislett Games in Oslo on 5 July. In terms of preparation for the Olympic Games held later that year in Atlanta, O'Sullivan's best event appeared to be the 5000 m, the distance at which she was the reigning world champion. On 5 June, at the Golden Gala meet in Rome, O'Sullivan won in 14:54.75. A month later, on 12 July, at the Securicor Games in London, she beat a strong field to win in 14:48.36. The program at the Olympic Games in Atlanta was sufficiently scheduled to allow O'Sullivan to contest both the 5000 m and 1500 m events. Her early season form and world title the previous year had made her one of the favourites for the 5000 m; however, news of double-world record holder Wang Junxia competing made many observers revise their opinion. In the heats <b>everything</b> <b>seemed</b> on track when she easily won her heat in 15:15.80. However, in the final on 28 July, she was badly affected by a stomach upset, and after starting well gradually faded away and failed to finish. The race was won by 3000 and 10,000 m world record holder Wang Junxia of China. Her disappointment continued in the 1500 m, where, still weakened, she came second last in her heat and failed to qualify for the semi-finals.|$|E

500|$|Stanley Donen {{was born}} in Columbia, South Carolina to Mordecai Moses Donen, a dress-shop manager, and Helen (Cohen), the {{daughter}} of a jewelry salesman. His younger sister Carla Donen Davis {{was born in}} August 1937. Although born to Jewish parents, he became an atheist in his youth. Donen described his childhood as lonely and unhappy {{as one of the few}} Jews in Columbia, and he was occasionally bullied by anti-semitic classmates at school. To help cope with his isolation, he spent much of his youth in local movie theaters and was especially fond of Westerns, comedies and thrillers. The film that had the strongest impact on him was the 1933 Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musical Flying Down to Rio. Donen said that he [...] "must have seen the picture thirty or forty times. I was transported into some sort of fantasy world where <b>everything</b> <b>seemed</b> to be happy, comfortable, easy and supported. A sense of well-being filled me." [...] He shot and screened home movies with an 8 mm camera and projector that his father bought for him.|$|E

[...] When the A bonds went on sale in London in November 1909, the issue was oversubscribed. [...] The following month, the contract for ties was awarded.

500|$|... "Gold Coat" [...] was Chinese Nü Yrs lead single, {{released}} on 7 October 2015. Six days later, the label Brainfeeder announced they would release the EP on 30 October 2015. Two {{days before the}} release of the EP, [...] the music blog Pigeons & Planes premiered [...] "Xiangjiao". Iglooghost said the name of the record came from looking at the sky while flying back home from his gig in Rome: [...] "The sky looked really weird and for some reason the word Chinese New Year came into my head. I was really happy, because <b>everything</b> <b>seemed</b> super cool, life just seemed really warm and nice. I think the word Chinese New Year sounds warm and cool. I imagine fireworks, red colours and Chinese lanterns.” Upon its distribution, Chinese Nü Yr garnered positive reviews. Gary Suarez, reviewing for The Quietus, spotlighted the EP's [...] "mirthfully manic synthesis of garage, hip hop, footwork, and as-yet undefined (sub)genres" [...] that [...] "makes him a beatmaker to watch." [...] Both Ryce and Exclaim! critic Ashley Hampson praised Malliagh for making such a unique record while still fitting with the works of other acts on the Brainfeeder label.|$|E
500|$|Al Aronowitz, a New York-based {{journalist}} {{and a friend}} of the Harrisons, later expressed his surprise at the failure of their marriage, saying: [...] "I never saw the breakup coming … around them <b>everything</b> <b>seemed</b> magical." [...] Harrison and Boyd met on the set of the Beatles' film A Hard Day's Night in 1964 and were married two years later. By the late 1960s, however, they had begun to grow apart due to Harrison's preoccupation with meditation and other spiritual pursuits. In an effort to regain her husband's attention, in 1970, Boyd responded to Clapton's long-held infatuation with her, only to reject his advances at that time. Unable to conceive a child, and with Harrison averse to adoption, Boyd resumed her career as a fashion model in May 1971, an activity that sat at odds with his spiritual convictions. According to Harrison biographer Elliot Huntley, the first public signs of a rift in the marriage came in August 1972. That month, Harrison travelled alone through Europe to Portugal to visit Gary Wright, who then [...] "played the diplomat" [...] by fending off press speculation regarding Boyd's absence.|$|E

500|$|... "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] also {{received}} a few mixed and negative reviews. Amos Barshad of New York magazine wrote that the ballad borrows more heavily from Beyoncé's own 2006 single [...] "Irreplaceable", and that [...] " [...] can't be a bad thing". However, he noted that [...] "this time in language ('Sucks to be you right now') agreeable to a nation of tweens and in a manner agreeable to anyone who likes yelping along in unison to ascendant pop choruses." [...] David Amidon of PopMatters wrote that lines like [...] "showed your ass" [...] and [...] "it must suck to be you" [...] exemplify lame lyrics. He concluded that, [...] " [...] are wondering how such lame lyrics could be sung with such earnestness." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian wrote that {{the most interesting thing}} about [...] "Best Thing I Never Had" [...] is the curious image evoked by the chorus' lyric, noting that <b>everything</b> <b>seemed</b> fine until [...] "the protagonist's former amorata 'showed your ass'". Music Weeks Ben Cardew commented that its 1980s sound is [...] "not a highlight".

500|$|The opening song, [...] "And It Stoned Me", {{was written}} about {{feelings}} of ecstasy received from witnessing and experiencing nature, in a narrative describing a rural setting with a county fair and mountain stream. Morrison said he based it on a quasi-mystical experience he {{had as a}} 12 year old fishing in the Comber village of Ballystockart, where he once asked for water from {{an old man who}} said he had retrieved it from a stream. [...] "We drank some and <b>everything</b> <b>seemed</b> to stop for me", the singer recalled, adding that it induced a momentary feeling of quietude in him. According to Hinton, these childhood images foreshadowed both spiritual redemption and—in Morrison's reference to [...] "" [...] in the chorus—sexual pleasure. AllMusic's Tom Maginnis argued that the singer was instead likening the experience to the first time hearing jazz pianist Jelly Roll Morton. The largely acoustic title track featured piano, guitar, saxophone, electric bass, and a flute over-dub backing Morrison, who sang of an adult romance set in Autumn and imitated a saxophone with his voice near the song's conclusion. [...] "This is a rock musician singing jazz, not a jazz singer, though the music itself has a jazz swing", Hinton remarked, noting how its rhythm is played in triplets rather than rock's archetypical quadruple time signature. [...] "Crazy Love" [...] was recorded with Morrison's voice so close to the microphone that it captured the click of Morrison's tongue hitting the roof of his mouth as he sang. He sings in falsetto, producing what Hinton felt was a sense of intense intimacy, backed by a female chorus.|$|E
500|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik was hugely {{successful}} upon its release on September 24, 1991. It peaked at number {{three on the}} Billboard charts, {{and went on to}} sell thirteen million copies worldwide. The unexpected success instantly turned the Red Hot Chili Peppers into rock stars. Frusciante was blindsided by his newfound fame, and struggled to cope with it. Soon after the album's release, he began to develop a dislike for the band's popularity. Kiedis recalled that he and Frusciante used to get into heated discussions backstage after concerts: [...] "John would say, 'We're too popular. I don't need to be at this level of success. I would just be proud to be playing this music in clubs like you guys were doing two years ago.'" [...] Frusciante later said that the band's rise to popularity was [...] "too high, too far, too soon. <b>Everything</b> <b>seemed</b> to be happening at once and I just couldn't cope with it." [...] He also began to feel that destiny was leading him away from the band. When the Chili Peppers began their world tour, he started to hear voices in his head telling him [...] "you won't make it during the tour, you have to go now." [...] Frusciante admitted to having once taken great pleasure in hedonism; however, [...] "by the age of twenty, I started doing it right and looking at it as an artistic expression instead of a way of partying and screwing a bunch of girls. To balance it out, I had to be extra-humble, extra-anti-rock star." [...] He refused to take the stage during a performance at Tokyo's Club Quattro on May 7, 1992, telling his bandmates that he was leaving the band. He was persuaded to perform, but left for California the next morning; according to the guitarist, [...] "it was just impossible for me to stay in the band any longer. It had come to the point where even though they wanted me in the band, it felt like I was forced out of the band. Not by any members in particular or management in particular, but just the direction it was going." [...] He was replaced by former Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro.|$|E
