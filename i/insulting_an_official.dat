6000|$|Harris led off at Stuttgart by <b>insulting</b> <b>an</b> <b>official.</b> Stuttgart is {{a charming}} town, clean and bright, a smaller Dresden. It has the {{additional}} attraction of containing little that one {{need to go}} out of one's way to see: a medium-sized picture gallery, a small museum of antiquities, and half a palace, and you are through with the entire thing and can enjoy yourself. Harris did not know it was an official he was insulting. He took it for a fireman (it looked like a fireman), and he called it a [...] "dummer Esel." ...|$|E
5000|$|Gabriel von Eisenstein, a Viennese man-about-town, {{has been}} sentenced to eight days in prison for <b>insulting</b> <b>an</b> <b>official,</b> {{partially}} due to the incompetence of his attorney, Dr. Blind. Adele, Eisenstein's maid, receives a forged letter, purportedly from her sister {{who is in the}} company of the ballet, but actually written by Falke, inviting her to Prince Orlofsky's ball. She pretends the letter says that her aunt is very sick, and asks her mistress Rosalinde (Eisenstein's wife) for an evening off ("Da schreibt meine Schwester Ida"/"My sister Ida writes to me"). Falke, Eisenstein's friend, arrives to invite him to the ball (Duet: [...] "Kommt mit mir zum Souper"/"Come with me to the souper"). Together, they recall a practical joke which Eisenstein played on Falke a few years ago, for which Falke is secretly planning a light-hearted revenge in kind. Eisenstein bids farewell to Adele and his wife Rosalinde, pretending he is going to prison (Trio: [...] "O Gott, wie rührt mich dies!"/"Oh dear, oh dear, how sorry I am") but really intending to postpone jail for one day and have fun at the ball.|$|E

50|$|In 2007 Nasibova’s husband Ilgar {{was arrested}} after criticizing the {{government}} in a letter, which exposed his treatment by police while reporting a protest at a local market. Ilgar’s intention in writing the letter was to elucidate the unfair treatment he and the protestors received, but he ended up being charged with slandering the very same officers.

Another {{said that she had}} been charged with <b>insulting</b> <b>a</b> public <b>official.</b> Still another report said that she had falsified her birthdate in <b>an</b> <b>official</b> document and was being held for deportation. Negrini attempted to visit her to deliver a package of food, but police would not permit her to see him. He later sent his aunt, who was informed that police would release Young within a few days. He even offered to sit in jail on her behalf so that she could go free, but this was rebuffed.|$|R
25|$|Shevardnadze {{started his}} {{political}} career in the late 1940s as a leading member of his local Komsomol organisation. He was later appointed its Second Secretary, then its First Secretary. His rise in the Georgian Soviet hierarchy continued until 1961 when he was demoted after he <b>insulted</b> <b>a</b> senior <b>official.</b> After spending two years in obscurity, Shevardnadze returned as a First Secretary of a Tbilisi city district, {{and was able to}} charge the Tbilisi First Secretary at the time with corruption. His anti-corruption work quickly garnered the interest of the Soviet government and Shevardnadze was appointed as First Deputy of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Georgian SSR. He would later become the head of the internal affairs ministry and was able to charge First Secretary (leader of Soviet Georgia) Vasil Mzhavanadze with corruption.|$|R
500|$|In 2017, Getzlaf {{was named}} {{a finalist for the}} Mark Messier Leadership Award along with Calgary Flames defencemen Mark Giordano and Columbus Blue Jackets forward Nick Foligno. In the 2017 playoffs, Getzlaf surpassed former {{teammate}} Teemu Selänne's franchise record of 35 playoff goals against the Edmonton Oilers in Game 4 of the best of seven series. During the Western Conference finals, Getzlaf was fined $10,000 for using a homophobic slur to <b>insult</b> <b>an</b> on-ice <b>official.</b> He later said, [...] "That's my responsibility to understand that there are eyes and ears on us all the time. Fortunately enough, nobody heard it. If you can read lips, it's a little bit harder, and I apologize for that. That's a thing that you won't hear from me again. I hope I didn't offend anybody outside the circle that we trust." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1784, the South Carolina {{legislature}} {{threatened to}} exile a tavern keeper {{by the name}} of William Thompson, for insulting [...] "Dictator" [...] John Rutledge, now the former governor and a prominent figure in the state. Rutledge had sent a female servant to Thompson's tavern to watch a fireworks display from the roof. Thompson denied the servant admittance and sent her back to Rutledge. Rutledge was furious and demanded that Thompson come to his house and apologize. Thompson refused and, believing that his honor had been affronted by Rutledge's arrogant request, challenged Rutledge to a duel. Since people like Rutledge did not associate with tavern keepers, Rutledge went to the South Carolina House of Representatives and insisted that it pass a bill banishing Thompson from the state for <b>insulting</b> <b>a</b> government <b>official.</b> [...] Thompson claimed that, Rutledge and others who were wealthy composed [...] "the grand hierarchy of the State." [...] Thompson argued that independent people required leaders who were [...] "good, able, useful and friends to social equality." [...] This altercation changed the hierarchy of state legislatures for years to come.|$|R

40|$|Criminal law can be rightly {{considered}} the maximum expression of any society’s ideal image, of its ‘Sollen’, {{in any given}} time. More specifically, criminal law, also through its peculiar ‘expressive force’, {{has the power to}} describe (as a model) and shape (through its legitimate use of State violence) the very delicate relationship between the individual and the community, which {{is at the heart of}} any social narrative. Through the analysis of the changes undergone in the past decades by three specific features of Italian criminal law (two criminal offences, i. e. <b>insult</b> to <b>a</b> public <b>official</b> and false accounting, and one criminal defence, i. e. self-defence), this essay will try and retrace how this relationship appears to have changed under different political regimes and through powerful socio-economic transformations, possibly to reveal also the ‘deceptive’ potential of criminal law itself, which we may assume to be related to its intrinsic ‘symbolic’ quality...|$|R

[...] "His remarks were utterly inappropriate and unwelcome," [...] she said. McAleese told the cardinal that she was the [...] "President of Ireland and not just of Catholic Ireland". At this point, a heated argument ensued between the two, according to McAleese.|$|R
50|$|On 24 February 2008, Warren posted {{multiple}} e-mail {{comments from}} viewers that attacked various secrets posted that week—notably one from <b>a</b> parent <b>insulting</b> <b>a</b> teacher, one from <b>a</b> call operator <b>insulting</b> <b>a</b> relative of a soldier, {{and one from}} <b>a</b> would-be mother <b>insulting</b> <b>a</b> woman desperate not to get pregnant.

While it was noted that sometimes such actions lead to others passing judgment on the posters without granting them the opportunity to defend themselves, no action was taken, and the blog continued as normal the next week.|$|R
