5000|$|On July 31, 2007, {{the role}} of the Advanced Individual Training (AIT) Platoon Sergeant was initiated. Prior to this, <b>Drill</b> <b>Sergeants</b> were {{responsible}} for managing AIT Soldiers. The Army replaced AIT <b>Drill</b> <b>Sergeants</b> as a way of allowing AIT Instructors to serve in leadership roles as Squad Leaders, further enabling the Platoon Sergeant to manage the Platoon in the same manner he or she would in a line unit. It also allowed Soldiers to feel more comfortable addressing both personal and professional issues with the Platoon Sergeant. The intimidating leadership style of Army <b>Drill</b> <b>Sergeants</b> seemed better suited for developing new recruits in Basic Training. AIT Platoon Sergeants do not wear the signature campaign hat that their predecessor <b>Drill</b> <b>Sergeants</b> wore before them. [...] "Pilot programs for the position were tested at Fort Lee, VA; Fort Bliss, TX; and Fort Jackson, S.C." ...|$|R
