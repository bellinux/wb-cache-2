The ratio between the critical velocity and the exit velocity at the <b>drop</b> <b>wall</b> was introduced to establish semi-theoretical equations. Regression techniques were applied by using the dimensionless channel bed slope and the drop number to describe the drop characteristics. There were 64 groups of test data to calibrate the parameters of equations. Another 36 groups of test data were used to verify the developed model.

40|$|Abstract- In this paper, the {{computational}} {{investigations have}} been performed to study the pressure and velocity characteristics of an incompressible fluid flowing through a plain symmetric suddenly expanded and contracted rectangular channel. The two-dimensional steady differential equations for conservation of mass and momentum are solved for the Reynolds number (Re) ranging from 50 to 350, the expansion length (Lexp) ranging from 1 to 20 and aspect ratio (AR) of 2. The effect of Reynolds number and expansion length on average static pressure, average stagnation pressure <b>drop,</b> <b>wall</b> pressure and pattern of velocity distribution has been studied in detail. From the study, it is revealed that all the above investigated parameters except average stagnation pressure drop are increased with increase in Reynolds number. However, the average stagnation pressure drop decreases with increase in Reynolds number. It is further observed that the variation of the said investigated parameters also depends on expansion length.

Hypoventilation is the main issue {{for the death of}} children with LSCTS after surgical correction. However, currently, little information is available on local aerodynamics to disclose the reasons for the improvement of such therapies, especially LSCTS with distal bronchus stenoses. Here, we investigated a patient-specific model of LSCTS with complete tracheal rings and bridging bronchus (BB). Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was applied to analyze the local aerodynamics around BB before and after tracheal surgery in inspiratory phase and expiratory phase.

40|$|The systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt is an {{effective}} procedure widely used in the therapy of congenital heart defect (CHD). To better understand the local flow features may provide hemodynamic information for patient-specific surgical design.

A patient-specific 3 D model after the MBTS was reconstructed. We applied the technique of computer-aided design (CAD) to virtually create a model of Melbourne shunt based on vascular anatomical position.

40|$|Although {{coronary}} tortuosity {{can influence}} the hemodynamics of coronary arteries, the relationship between tortuosity and flow has not been thoroughly investigated {{partly due to the}} absence of a widely accepted definition of tortuosity and the lack of patient-specific studies that analyze complete coronary trees. Using a computational approach we investigated the effects of tortuosity on coronary flow parameters including pressure <b>drop,</b> <b>wall</b> shear stress, and helical flow strength as measured by helicity intensity. Our analysis considered idealized and patient-specific geometries. Overall results indicate that perfusion pressure decreases with increased tortuosity, but the patient-specific results show that more tortuous vessels have higher physiological wall shear stress values. Differences between the idealized and patient-specific results reveal that an accurate representation of coronary tortuosity must account for all relevant geometric aspects, including curvature imposed by the heart shape. The patient-specific results exhibit a strong correlation between tortuosity and helicity intensity, and the corresponding helical flow contributes directly to the observed increase in wall shear stress. Therefore, helicity intensity may prove helpful in developing a universal parameter to describe tortuosity and assess its impact on patient health. Our data suggest that increased tortuosity could have a deleterious impact via a reduction in coronary perfusion pressure, but the attendant increase in wall shear stress could afford protection against atherosclerosis...|$|E

Quantification of the substrate leaching rate induced by droplet motion requires {{knowledge of the}} local heat and momentum transport coefficients. Against this background, the quasi-periodic time cycle of droplet growth, from the minimum drop size to drop slide-off /fall-off, fluid flow and heat transfer inside the <b>drop,</b> <b>wall</b> shear stresses between the condensate and the substrate, and the effective local and average transfer coefficients, are reported in the present study. The evolution of the collection of drops is numerically simulated by solving suitable model equations. Fluid motion and heat transfer inside a single drop are determined from the conservation equations using a finite volume method. Thermophysical properties, as appropriate for metallic vapor and liquid metals (Sodium, Potassium and Mercury) are utilized in the simulation.

When these valves dysfunction, a replacement is often necessary in severe cases. The current study presents {{an investigation of the}} pulsatile blood flow through a bileaflet mechanical heart valve (BMHV) where one leaflet is healthy and can fully open and the other leaflet cannot fully open with different levels of dysfunction. To better understand the implications that a dysfunctional leaflet has on the blood flow through these valves, analysis of flow characteristics such as velocity, pressure <b>drop,</b> <b>wall</b> shear stress and vorticity profiles was performed. Results suggested that leaflet dysfunction caused increased local velocities, separation regions and wall shear stresses. For example, the maximum velocity increased from 2. 53 m/s to 4. 9 m/s when dysfunction increased from 0 % to 100 %. The pressure drop increased (by up to 300 %) with dysfunctionality. Results suggested that leaflet dysfunction also caused increased wall shear stresses on the valve frame where higher stresses developed around the hinges (at 75 % and 100 % dysfunctions). Analysis also showed that increased dysfunctionality of one leaflet led to higher net shear forces on both the healthy and dysfunctional leaflets (by up to 200 % and 600 %, respectively).

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} numerically the thermal and hydrodynamics performance of circular microchannel heat exchanger (CMCHE) using various nanofluids. Design/methodology/approach - The three-dimensional steady, laminar developing flow and conjugate heat transfer governing equations of a balanced MCHE are solved using finite volume method. Findings - The results are shown in terms of temperature profile, heat transfer coefficient, pressure <b>drop,</b> <b>wall</b> shear stress, pumping power, effectiveness and performance index. The addition of nanoparticles increased the heat transfer rate of the base fluids. The temperature profiles of the fluids have revealed that higher average bulk temperatures were obtained by the nanofluids compared to water. The addition of nanoparticles also increased the pressure drop along the channels slightly. The increase in nanoparticle concentrations yielded better heat transfer rate while the increase in Reynolds number decreased the heat transfer rate. Research limitations/implications - The tested nanofluids are Ag, Al 2 O 3, CuO, SiO 2, and TiO 2. Reynolds number range varied from 100 to 800 and the nanoparticle concentration varied from 2 per cent to 10 per cent. Practical implications - Parallel flow in CMCHEs is used in thermal engineering applications and the design and performance analysis of these CMCHE are of practical importance.

40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the Stokes flow of an incompressible viscous fluid through a slit with periodic reabsorption at the walls. The momentum equation for the two dimensional flow is exactly solved in terms of stream function for two different cases of boundary conditions. Dimensional forms of stream function, velocity components, axial flow rate, pressure distribution, mean pressure <b>drop,</b> <b>wall</b> shear stress, fractional reabsorption and leakage flux are obtained. The points of maximum velocity components are also identified for fixed axial distance. Using physiological data of rat kidney, the theoretical values of periodic reabsorption and pressure drop for various values of fractional reabsorption are tabulated. The graphs of flow properties for both the cases are compared with the case of uniform reabsorption. It is shown that the periodic reabsorption parameter for both the cases plays a vital role in altering the flow properties, which are useful in analyzing flow behavior during the reabsorption of glomerular filtrate through a renal tubule in normal and diseased conditions. It is found that 50 % reabsorption of fluid from a single nephron can be achieved by setting α= 3. 197500134 cm for one of the cases which indicates {{that there is a need}} of artificial kidney for survival. In case 2, a minor treatment is needed as the value of α for 80 % reabsorption is not possible. Streamlines are also drawn to analyze the flow behavior through an abnormal renal tubule...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{feasibility}} of computationally simulating intracoronary blood flow based on real coronary artery geometry and to graphically depict various mechanical characteristics of this flow. Methods: Explanted fresh pig hearts were fixed using a continuous perfusion of 4 % formaldehyde at physiological pressures. Omnipaque dye added to lead rubber solution was titrated to an optimum proportion of 1 : 25, to cast the coronary arterial tree. The heart was stabilized in a phantom model so as to suspend the base and the apex without causing external deformation. High resolution computerized tomography scans of this model were utilized to reconstruct the three-dimensional coronary artery geometry, which in turn was used to generate several volumetric tetrahedral meshes of sufficient density needed for numerical accuracy. The transient equations of momentum and mass conservation were numerically solved by employing methods of computational fluid dynamics under realistic pulsatile inflow boundary conditions. Results: The simulations have yielded graphic distributions of intracoronary flow stream lines, static pressure <b>drop,</b> <b>wall</b> shear stress, bifurcation mass flow ratios and velocity profiles. The variability of these quantities within the cardiac cycle has been investigated at a temporal resolution of 1 / 100 th of a second and a spatial resolution of about 10 mm. The areas of amplified variations in wall shear stress, mostly evident in the neighborhoods of arterial branching, seem to correlate well with clinically observed increased atherogenesis.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. Piping materials for geothermal systems have been of numerous types with great variation in cost and durability. The temperature and chemical quality of the geothermal fluids, in addition to cost, usually determine the type of piping network material used. In this paper, four suitable types of piping materials according to chemical quality and temperature of the fluid were taken into consideration for Meshkinshahr 50 MWe geothermal power plant pipelines. Pipelines consist of two lines that transport the mixture of brine and steam from wellhead to separators, two steam lines from separator to power house and two brine lines from separator to reinjection wellheads. The design parameters; number of expansion loops and legs, pressure <b>drop,</b> <b>wall</b> thickness, weight span. pipe weight and length of the pipe are variable with different pipe materials. Each parameter has a specific significance in each line. For example, in steam lines, pressure drop {{is more important than}} that in other lines and less pressure drop in steam lines lead to increase the inlet pressure of turbine and more output power. Also, these parameters directly affect the cost of piping, fewer expansion loops and legs lead to use less pipe length and less pressure drop, larger weight spans result in less pipe supporting costs, and different thicknesses make different pipe unit weight and different transportation costs. In this paper we tried to select pipe material for a 50 MWe geothermal power plant pipelines. ej 201...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{comparative study of}} simulated blood flow in different configurations of simplified composite arterial coronary grafts (CACGs). Even though the composite arterial grafting is increasingly used in cardiac surgery, it is still questionable {{whether or not the}} blood flow in such grafts can adequately meet the demands of the native myocardial circulation. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed to conduct computer-based studies of simulated blood flow in four different geometric configurations of CACGs, corresponding to routinely used networks in cardiac surgery coronary grafts (T, Y, Pi and sequential). The flow was assumed three-dimensional, laminar and steady and the fluid as Newtonian, while the vessel walls were considered as inelastic and impermeable. It was concluded that local haemodynamics, practically described by velocity, pressure <b>drop,</b> <b>wall</b> shear stress (WSS) and flow rates, may be strongly influenced by the local geometry, especially at the anastomotic sites. The. computations were made at mean flow rates of 37. 5, 75 and 150 ml/min. The side-branch outflow rates, computed for each bypass graft, showed noticeable differences. The results, which were found both qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with other studies, indicate that the Pi-graft exhibits significantly less uniform distribution of outflow rates than the other geometric configurations. Moreover, prominent variations in WSS and velocity distribution among the assessed CACGs were predicted, showing remarkable flow interactions among the arterial branches. The lowest shear stress regions were found on the lateral walls of bifurcations, which are predominantly susceptible to the occurrence of coronary artery disease (CAD). In contrast, the highest WSS were observed {{at the turn of the}} arterial branches. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

However, {{there is a need for}} research on two-phase flow in large diameter pipes to provide confidence to designers of equipments such as deep water risers. In this study a number of experimental campaigns were carried out to measure pressure drop, liquid film thickness and wall shear in 127 mm vertical pipe. Total pressure drop were studied systematically through a data bank of 600 experimental runs. Magnitude and directional wall shear stress measurements have been made selectively using commercial non-directional probes and directional hot films. The latter were produced at Nottingham University during this study. Experimental data on liquid film characteristics were obtained by measuring total pressure <b>drop,</b> <b>wall</b> shear stress and film thickness simultaneously. In addition, the data were supported by some high speed video images through a visualization campaign. The pressure drop profile (time-averaged total pressure drop as a function of gas flow rate) introduced is visibly different from that for smaller pipes as it does not show a clear minima in the chum-annular transition region and not in both bubble-slug and slug-chum region. No completely unidirectional upward flow has been observed in the range of the conditions studied from the results of directional wall shear stress measurement which provided information on both time-varying and time-averaged wall shear stress. A condition of zero wall shear stress not reached. However, there was a minimum observed in the plot of mean wall shear stress against dimensionless gas velocity. This minimum occurred at the same dimensionless velocity for the present data at those from small diameter pipes. The change in the direction of the liquid film also supported by the measurements of local film thickness and high speed video images which have shown waves move both upward and downward and not purely in axial direction.

Species composition and relative abundance of ichthyofaunal assemblages on reefs surrounding Guanaja, Bay Islands, Honduras were censused from June through December 1996. Transect and random swim surveys were used to characterize community structure across patch, fringing, barrier, and wall reef types at five permanent study sites (transect surveys) and 24 randomly visited sites (random swim censuses). Overall, 170 species were documented during transect and random swim censuses. One hundred and one species representing 32 families and 23, 512 individuals were sighted during 216 transect surveys of reef crest and wall habitats. Four species, masked goby (Coryphopterus personatus), blue chromis (Chromis cyanea), bluehead wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum), and fairy bassist (Gramma loreto) represented 54. 7 % of the individuals recorded during transect surveys. Reef crest transects at permanent study sites yielded 83 species representing 26 families dominated by Families Pomacentridae, Labridae, and Scaridae. Adjacent wall transects produced higher totals (92 species representing 31 families) dominated by Gobiidae and Grammatidae. Wall transects also yielded higher species/census (2 of 4 sites) and individuals/census (3 of 4) sites statistics. Reef type and topographical characteristics (i. e. depth and habitat complexity) were major factors in structuring reef fish assemblages at each of the five permanent study sites surrounding Guanaja. Species totals at respective sites only varied from 66 (Bayman Drop) to 72 (Rainbow Reef); however, differences in community composition were notable across sites. Steep wails and overhangs at Bayman <b>Drop</b> (<b>wall</b> reel) provided preferred habitat for masked goby and fairy bassist, and thus facilitated this site exhibiting peak CPUE (1. 48 individuals/m?) recorded among sites. Conversely, lack of habitat complexity at Bayman Drop limited species/census statistics to the lowest across sites. Blacktip Slumberland reef site, in exhibiting increased depth and decreased habitat complexity, yielded the lowest CPUE (0. 79 individuals/m?) among all sites. Random swim censuses conducted in conjunction with transect surveys targeted three habitats (wall reef crest, and sandy bottom), and provided a more complete species listing of fishes. One hundred fifty-nine species representing 44 families were sighted at 24 reef sites in 143 daytime random swims, while 79 species from 30 families were observed during 26 nighttime random swims.
