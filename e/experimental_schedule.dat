40|$|To {{increase}} the dose-intensity of two drugs in metastatic breast cancer, {{we tested the}} feasibility, in phase I studies, of two schedules of epirubicin (E) and cyclophosphamide (C) - sequential (E [...] > C) and alternating (E/C) - {{with respect to the}} standard combination (EC). Drugs were given at three planned-dose levels, plus either G-CSF or GM-CSF. Patients with metastatic (30), inoperable stage IIIb (2) or inflammatory (7) breast cancer were treated. The doses of EC, given every 21 days (4 cycles), were 75 / 1500, 82. 5 / 2250, 90 / 3000 mg/m 2. In the E/C schedule, epirubicin was given at cycles 1, 3 and 5, and cyclophosphamide at cycles 2, 4 and 6. In the E [...] > C schedule, three cycles of epirubicin then three cycles of cyclophosphamide were administered. In both <b>experimental</b> <b>schedules,</b> drugs were given every 14 days for 6 cycles at doses of 100, 110, 120 mg/m 2 (E) and 2000, 3000, 4000 mg/m 2 (C). The average relative dose-intensity was 1. 2 -fold and 2 -fold greater with E/C and E [...] > C, respectively, than with EC. The third level dose was feasible with all schedules. Grade 4 leucopenia occurred in 77 % of patients. Thrombocytopenia was absent in 6 cases and grade 4 in 12 (30. 8 %). Eighty-one percent of patients on <b>experimental</b> <b>schedules</b> required red blood cell support versus 44. 4 % of patients on EC. At the third level, platelet transfusions were more frequent among patients treated with EC (27. 8 %). Non-haematological toxicity was mild: about 20 % of patients experienced grade 3 vomiting, irrespective of schedule. Only 2 patients had grade 3 mucositis; no patient developed heart failure. Fever (61 % of patients) and bone pain (55. 5 % of patients) were relevant in the GM-CSF treated groups and 12 patients shifted to G-CSF. The overall response rate was 84. 6 %: 5 / 39 (12. 8 %) complete response and 28 / 39 (71. 8 %) partial response. At 30 / 9 / 98, median survival was 29. 5 months, with no difference between patients with metastatic and stage IIIb/inflammatory breast cancer. Median follow-up of surviving patients was 62 months (range 17 - 83). The 5 -year estimated survival was 19 % (95 % confidence intervals = 7 - 31 %). Rapidly alternating or sequential cycles of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide with CSF support is a feasible strategy that allows a higher increase of dose-intensity of the single drugs.

Due to the paucity of published phase I data on the 3 -weekly <b>experimental</b> <b>schedule</b> used, an early safety analysis was planned. Methods Patients with ovarian cancer (stage Ic-IV), aged 2, every 3 weeks or to carboplatin AUC 5 plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin 30 mg/m 2, every 3 weeks. Treatment was planned for 6 cycles. Toxicity was coded according to the NCI-CTC version 2. 0. Results The pre-planned safety analysis was performed in July 2004. Data from the first 50 patients treated with carboplatin plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin were evaluated. Median age was 60 years (range 34 – 75). Forty-three patients (86 %) completed 6 cycles. Two thirds of the patients {{had at least one}} cycle delayed due to toxicity, but 63 % of the cycles were administered on time. In most cases the reason for chemotherapy delay was neutropenia or other hematological toxicity. No delay due to palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) was recorded. No toxic death was recorded. Reported hematological toxicities were: grade (G) 3 anemia 16 %, G 3 /G 4 neutropenia 36 % and 10 % respectively, G 3 / 4 thrombocytopenia 22 % and 4 % respectively. Non-haematological toxicity was infrequent: pulmonary G 1 6 %, heart rhythm G 1 4 %, liver toxicity G 1 6 %, G 2 4 % and G 3 2 %. Complete hair loss was reported in 6 % of patients, and G 1 neuropathy in 2 %. PPE was recorded in 14 % of the cases (G 1 10 %, G 2 2 %, G 3 2 %). Conclusion This safety analysis shows that the adopted schedule of carboplatin plus pegylated liposomal doxorubicin given every 3 weeks is feasible as first line treatment in ovarian cancer patients, although 37 % of the cycles were delayed due to haematological toxicity. Toxicities that are common with standard combination of carboplatin plus paclitaxel (neurotoxicity and hair loss) are infrequent with this <b>experimental</b> <b>schedule,</b> and skin toxicity appears manageable. </p...|$|E
40|$|Monomer {{diffusion}} {{plays an}} important role in the process of hologram formation in photopolymer materials. The gradient of monomer generated during the recording process origins a motion of the monomer molecules from the dark to the bright zones. The high physical thickness of photopolymers required to use them as holographic memories implies an additional gradient of monomer in depth. The exposure time needed to record a single hologram is very short; nevertheless if many holograms are multiplexed an exposure time around 100 s or more is required. For this long period the importance of monomer diffusion in depth must be studied. Other important factor in order to design an <b>experimental</b> <b>schedule</b> is the time needed between two consecutive holograms. In this work we analyze the importance of the monomer diffusion in depth in these cases using a three-dimensional diffusion model solved using a finite differences method.

40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{estimation of}} drug stability parameters (energy of activation E(a) and shelf-life t(Y)) by conventional approaches employs equations relating drug content determination C {{at time t}} and temperature T.

However, {{it is well known}} that because of experimental concentration variation or of intentional modification of the <b>experimental</b> <b>schedule,</b> there are as many initial drug contents as experiments. For these reasons, a method which takes into account batch effects is proposed to determine stability parameters and also all initial drug contents C(0 j) where j is the index of experiment in one step.

This {{study was conducted}} on 7 elderly women aged 65 or over. Two kinds of clothing ensemble (control and prototype) were used as experimental clothing. The control clothing was a general clothing ensemble and the prototype clothing lowered clothing pressure by adding an extra gap. The <b>experimental</b> <b>schedule</b> included daily living activities with randomly assigned experimental clothing. Rectal tem-perature was constantly measured every 5 minutes during the experiment and saliva samples for melatonin and cortisol were collected twice per day before and after sleep. The rectal temperature was lower for the prototype than the control throughout the experiment, and its circadian rhythm was prompt and clear in prototype. In addition, melatonin was secreted more but cortisol was secreted less when the subjects wore the prototype clothing. With these results, we assumed that regular circadian rhythm and low level of stress might be caused by wearing prototype clothing that lowered clothing pressure.

40|$|Abstract. Solid {{particle}} erosion (SPE) wear {{characteristics of}} particulate filled polymer matrix composites {{have been widely}} explored by different investigators. Through judicious control of reinforcing solid particulate phase, selection of matrix and suitable processing technique, composites can be prepared to tailor the properties needed for any specific application. Due to high cost of conventional ceramic fillers, it has become important to explore the potential of cheap materials like mineral ores and industrial wastes for utilization in preparing particle-reinforced polymer composites. Previous researchers have reported the use of industrial wastes such as fly ash and red mud as filler materials in polymeric matrices. But the reinforcing potential of blast furnace slag (BFS) particle, a solid waste generated from pig iron production route, has not been explored so far in polymeric materials. In this work, composite samples are prepared by reinforcing micro-sized blast furnace slag as the particulate filler in epoxy resin reinforced with bi-directional glass fibre.
