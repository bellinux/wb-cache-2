40|$|In {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{it has long}} been thought that cells must reach a {{critical}} cell size, called the “setpoint,” in order to allow the Start cell cycle transition. Recent evidence suggests that this setpoint is lowered when ribosome biogenesis is slowed. Here we present evidence that yeast can sense ribosome biogenesis independently of mature ribosome levels and protein synthetic capacity. Our results suggest that ribosome biogenesis directly promotes passage through Start through Whi 5, the yeast functional equivalent to the human tumor suppressor Rb. When ribosome biogenesis is inhibited, a Whi 5 -dependent mechanism inhibits passage through Start before significant decreases in both the number of ribosomes and in overall translation capacity of the cell become evident. This delay at Start in response to decreases in ribosome biogenesis occurs independently of Cln 3, the major known Whi 5 antagonist. Thus ribosome biogenesis may be sensed at multiple steps in Start regulation. Ribosome biogenesis may thus both <b>delay</b> <b>Start</b> by increasing the cell size setpoint and independently may promote Start by inactivating Whi 5...|$|E

40|$|Background: Acute {{respiratory}} tract infection {{is a major}} cause of morbidity and mortality in developing and also developed countries. About 13 Million under 5 children dies every year in the world, 95 % of them in developing countries, one third of total deaths are due to ARI. Objective: To study the epidemiological profile of ARI and find out associated risk factors of ARI in under 5 children living in urban and rural areas of Ahmedabad district. Materials and Methods: A cross sectional study was covering 500 under 5 children living in urban (five zone) and rural (five PHC of Sanand taluka) area of Ahmedabad district from September 2008 to March 2009. Results: Occurrence of ARI was found to be 22 %, it was lower in urban area (17. 2 %) as compare to rural area (26. 8 %) higher in.

40|$|AbstractDiesel {{engines are}} very well known for their high torque and high thermal efficiency. But, the {{increase}} in demand of energy, rapid depletion of fossil fuels and meeting the stringent emission regulations, the researchers take interest to derive the alternative fuels from renewable resources. Among from all the different alternative fuels, vegetable oil has potential to substitute the traditional diesel fuels. The well-established transesterification process is generally used {{for the production of}} biodiesel from vegetable oil. In transesterification process the tri-glycerides are converted into mono glycerides with the help of alcohol and catalyst under certain temperature. In the present research work cottonseed vegetable oil is used to produce biodiesel by transesterification process using methanol and KOH as catalyst. As diesel engine combustion is heterogeneous spray combustion, it is very complex phenomenon. The physico-chemical properties of biodiesel are slightly different from diesel fuel. It is very interesting to study the combustion characteristics of a cottonseed based biodiesel fuelled diesel engine. This was the main motivation to take up this study to understand and analyze the combustion characteristics of a cottonseed biodiesel fuelled diesel engine. The experiment was carried out on a single cylinder diesel engine for base diesel and cottonseed biodiesel blends (B 5, B 10, B 15, and B 20) as a fuel. The combustion characteristics such as ignition <b>delay,</b> <b>start</b> of combustion, premixed, diffusion and after burning combustion phases, end of combustion and combustion duration were analyzed and compared with base diesel. It was observed that ignition delay and maximum rate of pressure rise decreased with biodiesel as compared to base diesel due to higher cetane number of biodiesel blends which confirms the smooth running of the engine. Ignition delay decreased from 11 °CA with base diesel to 6. 5 °CA with B 20 biodiesel. The start of combustion was advanced with all biodiesel blends due to higher bulk modulus results in automatic advance in dynamic injection timing and lesser ignition delay. The combustion duration was longer with all biodiesel blends as compared to base diesel due to longer injection duration results in poor performance of the engine with biodiesel blends...|$|E

40|$|Rationale and Objectives. To find {{signs in}} vector-electrocardiography (VECG) {{predicting}} the ventricular fibrillatory propensity (VF-PROP) of iodixanol and mannitol solutions after injection {{into the left}} coronary artery (LCA) of pigs. Materials and Methods. Five plasma-isotonic solutions perfused LCA: lod 320 + Na/Ca (iodixanol 320 mg I/mL, 19 mM NaCl, 0. 3 mM CaCl 2), lod 320 + Mann (iodixanol 320 mg I/mL, 50 mM mannitol), Mann + Na/Ca (240 mM mannitol, 19 mM NaCl, 0. 3 mM CaCl 2) Mann (275 mM mannitol), and Ringer (representing "physiologic electrolytes"). The first two solutions have at 37 degrees C viscosity 13 mPas and the others < 1 mPas. In eight pigs, 20 mL of each solution was injected twice for 10 seconds, and in 15 pigs, each solution was injected for 11 - 40 seconds (0. 5 mL/second) through a wedged catheter in the LCA. If ventricular fibrillation (VF) occurred, injection was stopped and heart was defibrillated. If VF did not occur, perfusion period was 40 seconds. A higher frequency of VF and a shorter period from start of injection until start of VF gave a solution a higher ranking of VF-PROP. Results. The 10 -second injections caused no VF. Ringer and lod 320 + Na/Ca caused no VF after 40 -second injections, whereas the other solutions caused VF. Ranking the solutions from lowest to highest VF-PROP gave: Ringer = lod 320 + Na/Ca < lod 320 + Mann < Mann + Na/Ca < Mann. Prolongation of QRS time and QTc time were the only VECG signs that showed significant differences (P <. 05) between all solutions and correctly ranked the VF-PROP of all solutions in both animal groups. Conclusion. The results fit with the concept that a more physiologic electrolyte composition and a higher viscosity of a test solution will, after start of injection of that solution into LCA, delay changes in the electrolyte composition in myocardial interstitial fluid and also <b>delay</b> <b>start</b> of VF. If a plasma isotonic contrast medium (CM) with lower viscosity than that of iodixanol at 320 mgI/mL were created, we conclude that such a CM should have electrolyte composition closer to that of Ringer than present composition (19 mM NaCl and 0. 3 mM CaCl 2) to counteract the effects of faster diffusion of nonphysiologic electrolyte composition from the low-viscosity CM to myocardial interstitial fluid...|$|E

40|$|Parkinson’s {{disease is}} an age-related {{degenerative}} disorder {{of the central}} nervous system that often impairs the sufferer’s motor skills and speech, as well as other functions. Symptoms can include tremor, stiffness, slowness of movement, and impaired balance. An estimated four million people worldwide suffer from the disease, which usually affects people over the age of 60. Presently, there is no precedent for approving any drug as having a modifying effect (i. e., slowing or delaying) for disease progression of Parkinson’s disease. Clinical trial designs such as <b>delayed</b> <b>start</b> and withdrawal are being proposed to discern symptomatic and protective effects. The current work focused on understanding the features of <b>delayed</b> <b>start</b> design using prior knowledge from published and data submitted to US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) as part of drug approval or protocol evaluation. Clinical trial simulations were conducted to evaluate the false-positive rate, power under a new statistical analysis methodology, and various scenarios leading to patient discontinuations from clinical trials.
