We show that any equilibrium allocation {{that can be}} attained with open market operations can be replicated with <b>standing</b> <b>facilities,</b> but that the converse is not true. Furthermore, the set of equilibrium allocations that can be attained with <b>standing</b> <b>facilities</b> is weakly dominated in terms of welfare by the set of equilibrium allocations that can be attained with open market operations. However, if the central bank chooses the optimal policy for each mechanism, the allocations are equivalent.

40|$|The {{banking system}} is modeled {{in a closed}} system of {{financial}} accounts, whereby the equilibrium volume of bank intermediation between households and corporates reflects structural parameters such as household preferences, comparative cost structures of heterogeneous banks, loan demand of corporates, {{and the difference between}} the borrowing rate and the deposit facility rate of the central bank. The model also allows understanding the link between this difference (the width of the central bank <b>standing</b> <b>facilities</b> corridor) and the stance of monetary policy, and how this link changes during a financial crisis. It is shown how the narrowing of the <b>standing</b> <b>facilities</b> corridor can make more accommodating the stance of monetary policy in a financial crisis.

40|$|In a three-stage game {{in which}} banks can obtain {{liquidity}} through open market operations, interbank transactions or <b>standing</b> <b>facilities</b> we compare the equilibrium outcomes of fixed and variable rate tenders in the primary market. We focus on bidding behavior, induced allotment ratios, functioning of the secondary market and resorting to <b>standing</b> <b>facilities,</b> under several scenarios, among which collateral shortage and credit rationing. It is shown that overbidding is inherent to the fixed rate auction, but can be very mitigated under a variable rate procedure. Due {{to the existence of}} a finite number of equilibria, variable rate tenders allow keeping the informational content of quantity bids, as opposed to fixed rate tenders. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} different operational {{central bank}} policies {{and their impact}} on the behaviour of the money market interest rate. The model combines profit maximising behaviour by commercial banks with the central bank supplying the liquidity that keeps the market rate on target. It seems that frequent liquid-ity supplying operations represent an efficient tool to control money market rates. An averaging provision reduces the use of <b>standing</b> <b>facilities</b> and interest rates volatility in all days except for {{the last day of the}} maintenance period. Whenever banks have different maintenance horizons both the spikes in volatility and use of <b>standing</b> <b>facilities</b> disappear. The paper also compares two different liquidity supply policies and finds that the level of liquidity necessary to keep the rates on target depends on not only the aggregate but also assets values of individual banks.

40|$|<b>Standing</b> <b>facilities</b> are {{designed}} to place an upper bound on the rates at which financial institutions lend to one another overnight, reducing the volatility of the overnight interest rate, typically the rate targeted by central banks. However, improper design of the facility might decrease a bank’s incentive to participate actively in the interbank market. Thus, the mere availability of central bank provided credit may lead to its use being more than what would be expected based {{on the characteristics of}} the interbank market.; By contrast, however, banks may perceive a stigma from using such facilities, and thus borrow less than what one might expect, thereby reducing the facilities’ effectiveness at reducing interest rate volatility. We develop a model demonstrating these two alternative implications of a <b>standing</b> <b>facility.</b> Empirical predictions of the model are then tested using data from the Federal Reserve’s new primary credit facility and the US federal funds market. A comparison of data from before and after recent changes to the discount window suggests continued reluctance to borrow from the Fed. Discount window; Federal funds market (United States) ...|$|R

40|$|It is {{generally}} recognised that the operational {{framework for the}} monetary policy of the Eurosystem 1 has been functioning well since {{the launch of the}} euro in 1999. There has been little need to conduct fine-tuning operations, because of the averaging provision of the minimum reserve system {{and the quality of the}} Eurosystem’s liquidity forecasts. Also, credit institutions have had only limited recourse to the <b>standing</b> <b>facilities,</b> which shows that the money market has been working efficiently. And the small and fairly stable spread between the ECB’s fixed or minimum bid rate on its main refinancing operations and the short-term money market rates displays the ability of the ECB to influence short-term interest rates. Despite th{{is generally}} positive assessment, some possible measures have been examined with the aim of further improving the efficiency of the operational framework. There are three changes to be considered: (1) changing the timing of the reserve maintenance period, so that it would always start on the settlement day of the main refinancing operation following the Governing Council meeting at which the discussion of monetary policy is pre-scheduled, so that – as a rule – the implementation of changes to the <b>standing</b> <b>facility</b> rates would be aligned with the start of a new reserve maintenance period...|$|R
