5|$|Among Madgwick's priorities, in {{addition}} to the mandated extension program, was the expansion of the university's curriculum while orienting it to meet the needs and culture of the New England community. As the first Australian university located in a rural area, Madgwick focused the university's development in the areas of adult education, agriculture, and ranching. These programs would <b>help</b> <b>define</b> the new university.|$|E
5|$|Lemur {{behavior}} is as variable as lemur morphology. Differences in diet, social systems, activity patterns, locomotion, communication, predator avoidance tactics, breeding systems, and intelligence levels <b>help</b> <b>define</b> lemur taxa and set individual species {{apart from the}} rest. Although trends frequently distinguish the smaller, nocturnal lemurs from the larger, diurnal lemurs, there are often exceptions that help exemplify the unique and diverse nature of these Malagasy primates.|$|E
5|$|Persona was {{the first}} {{role-playing}} entry in the Megami Tensei series {{to be released in}} the west, with the first Megami Tensei release being action game Jack Bros. in 1995. While the main Megami Tensei series' use of Christian imagery made it unsuitable for localization at the time, Persona employed a different naming system to make it more acceptable. Persona was localized by Atlus' then-new North American branch Atlus USA. Persona was chosen as a series that could <b>help</b> <b>define</b> the company and compete with the likes of Final Fantasy, Suikoden and Breath of Fire. The team that localized Persona was quite small, which made the process quite difficult: not only was there a large amount of text to translate, but the team needed to adjust or change the Japanese references as they feared it might alienate western players. Among the changes were altering the player character's hairstyle, the ethnic origins of multiple characters, the character and location names, and multiple pieces of dialogue. The entire Snow Queen route was also cut from the game, leaving only the SEBEC story route open for exploration.|$|E

25|$|Ultimately, over 60,000 German Jews escaped {{persecution}} by the Nazis {{directly or}} indirectly through the Ha'avara Agreement. In addition, the Ha'avara Agreement transferred an approximate $100 million to the British Mandate of Palestine, which helped establish an industrial infrastructure for the soon to be Jewish nation. Ha'avara Agreement funds were also utilized for purchasing land and developing many new Jewish settlements, which now <b>help</b> <b>define</b> the current boundaries of Israel.|$|E
25|$|Over twenty small {{municipalities}} and shires were amalgamated in 1925 to {{form the}} City of Brisbane, governed by the Brisbane City Council. 1930 was a significant year for Brisbane with the completion of Brisbane City Hall, then the city's tallest building and the Shrine of Remembrance, in ANZAC Square, which has become Brisbane's main war memorial. These historic buildings, along with the Story Bridge which opened in 1940, are key landmarks that <b>help</b> <b>define</b> the architectural character of the city.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} consequences to the mines of Pachuca and Real del Monte during the War of Independence were ruinous. In 1824, British mining companies {{were brought in}} to revive the sector. The British introduced steam-powered machinery and other modern techniques {{as well as a}} large quantity of Cornish miners. Many of these Cornish miners stayed and English names and foods such as pasties (called “pastes” in Spanish) <b>help</b> <b>define</b> the state, especially in the Pachuca and Real del Monte areas. These Englishmen were forced to sell their interest to Mexican capitalists in 1849, and the mining sector fell again.|$|E
25|$|North Omaha is home {{to several}} {{important}} annual events that <b>help</b> <b>define</b> and celebrate the community, its history, and its future. Native Omaha Days is a biennial North Omaha cultural tradition, reuniting members of the city's African-American community. The Days are commemorated {{with a variety of}} events, including the Evergreen Reunion, named after a town in Alabama from where many families' ancestors migrated. Other annual activities include the Juneteenth Parade, to mark Emancipation; the Fort Omaha Intertribal Powwow; the Omaha Blues, Jazz & Gospel Festival, Florence Days, and the Omaha North High School Homecoming, which includes a parade for the community. The Stone Soul Picnic is also an important annual event in the community.|$|E
25|$|Except for Ballistico Fest, Oucho Sparks {{as a music}} {{project was}} unseen from 2003-2007. During that period, the band {{reformed}} once again and {{decided to take a}} more vocal-focused approach. In late 2003 the band started a new recording to <b>help</b> <b>define</b> the musical direction. Laura Grey joined to provide female vocals, while former saxophonist Tim Sandusky took over lead male vocals. In order to properly record this album, Tim Sandusky and cohorts built a recording studio in Chicago now known as Studio Ballistico. The album Foreign Cars and Robots was completed near the end of 2006. This album marked the modern age of Oucho Sparks and supporting shows in 2007 reflect this.|$|E

25|$|The {{two main}} tasks of {{transcription}} initiation are to provide RNA polymerase with an {{access to the}} promoter and to assemble general transcription factors with polymerase into a transcription initiation complex. Diverse mechanisms of initiating transcription by overriding inhibitory signals at the gene promoter have been identified. Eukaryotic genes have acquired extensive regulatory sequences that encompass {{a large number of}} regulator-binding sites and spread overall kilobases (sometimes hundreds of kilobases) from the promoter–-both upstream and downstream. The regulator binding sites are often clustered together into units called enhancers. Enhancers can facilitate highly cooperative action of several transcription factors (which constitute enhanceosomes). Remote enhancers allow transcription regulation at a distance. Insulators situated between enhancers and promoters <b>help</b> <b>define</b> the genes that an enhancer can or cannot influence.|$|E
25|$|Archaeopteryx has {{historically}} been considered the first bird, or Urvogel. Although newer fossil discoveries filled the gap between theropods and Archaeopteryx, {{as well as the}} gap between Archaeopteryx and modern birds, phylogenetic taxonomists, in keeping with tradition, almost always use Archaeopteryx as a specifier to <b>help</b> <b>define</b> Aves. Aves has more rarely been defined as a crown group consisting only of modern birds. Nearly all palaeontologists regard birds as coelurosaurian theropod dinosaurs. Within Coelurosauria, multiple cladistic analyses have found support for a clade named Maniraptora, consisting of therizinosauroids, oviraptorosaurs, troodontids, dromaeosaurids, and birds. Of these, dromaeosaurids and troodontids are usually united in the clade Deinonychosauria, which is a sister group to birds (together forming the node-clade Eumaniraptora) within the stem-clade Paraves.|$|E
25|$|The Coso Volcanic Field is {{best known}} for its Pleistocene {{rhyolite}}. Thirty-eight rhyolite domes and flows form an elongate array atop a north-trending 8 x 20-kilometer horst of Mesozoic bedrock. Nearby uneroded constructional forms are exhibited by most domes. Many are nested within tuff ring craters, and a few filled and overrode their craters to feed flows a kilometer or two long. The two oldest domes contain several percent phenocrysts; the rest are essentially aphyric. Obsidian is exposed locally on most extrusions, and analyses of fresh glass indicate that all of the rhyolite is of the so-called high-silica variety; SiO2 content is essentially constant at 77 percent. Other major-element constituents are nearly invariant. However, trace-element contents vary and <b>help</b> <b>define</b> 7 age groups, each of unique chemical composition.|$|E

500|$|The {{output of}} {{forecast}} models based on atmospheric dynamics {{is unable to}} resolve some details of the weather near the Earth's surface. As such, a statistical relationship between the output of a numerical weather model and the ensuing conditions at the ground {{was developed in the}} 1970s and 1980s, known as model output statistics (MOS). [...] Starting in the 1990s, model ensemble forecasts have been used to <b>help</b> <b>define</b> the forecast uncertainty and to extend the window in which numerical weather forecasting is viable farther into the future than otherwise possible.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1902 Chamberlin studied at the Hopkins Marine Station of Stanford University, and from 1902 to 1904 studied at Cornell University under a Goldwin Smith Fellowship, {{and was a member}} of the Gamma Alpha {{fraternity}} and Sigma Xi honor society. He studied under entomologist John Henry Comstock and earned his doctorate in 1904. His dissertation was a taxonomic revision of the wolf spiders of North America, in which he reviewed all known species north of Mexico, recognizing 67 [...] out of around 150 nominal species as distinct and recognizable. Zoologist Thomas H. Montgomery regarded Chamberlin's monograph as one of [...] "decided importance" [...] in using the structure of pedipalps (male reproductive organs) to <b>help</b> <b>define</b> genera, and in its detailed descriptions of species.|$|E
