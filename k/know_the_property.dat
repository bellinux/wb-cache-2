[...] She spoke with sternness and his silence appeared again to represent an admission that her sternness counted for him. Possibly she was touched by it; after a few moments, at any rate, during which nothing more passed between them, she appealed {{to him in a}} gentler and more anxious key, which had this virtue to touch him that he knew it was absolutely {{the first time in her}} life she had really begged for anything. She had never been obliged to beg; she had got on without it and most things had come to her. He might judge therefore in what a light she regarded this boon for which in her bereft old age she humbled herself to be a suitor. There was such a pride in her that he could feel what it cost her to go on her knees even to her son. He did judge how it was in his power to gratify her; and as he was generous and imaginative he was stirred and shaken as it came over him in a wave of figurative suggestion that he might make up to her for many things. He scarcely needed to hear her ask with a pleading wail that was almost tragic: [...] "Don't you see how things have turned out for us? Don't you know how unhappy I am, don't you know what a bitterness----?" [...] She stopped with a sob in her voice and he recognised vividly this last tribulation, the unhealed wound of her change of life and her lapse from eminence to flatness. [...] "You know what Percival is and the comfort I have of him. You <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>property</b> and what he's doing with it and what comfort I get from that!

5000|$|Attribute A2 {{represents}} {{knowledge about}} the property of factors. An example of an item that measures this attribute is [...] "If (p + 1)(t - 3) = 0 and p is positive, what {{is the value of}} t?” The examinee must <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>property</b> that the value of at least one factor must be zero if the product of multiple factors is zero. Once this property is recognized, the examinee would be able to recognize that because p is positive, (t - 3) must be zero to make the value of the whole expression zero, which would finally yield the value of 3 for t. To answer this item correctly, the examinee should have mastered both attributes A1 and A2.|$|E

The present article deals with finite element based vibration analysis of a nonprismatic cracked beam. The beam is modeled using the Timoshenko beam theory. The governing equation of motion is derived by the Hamilton's principle. In order to solve the governing equation two noded beam element with two degrees of freedom (DOF) per node is considered. In this work the effect of structural damping is also incorporated in the finite element model. The dynamic analysis is carried out by using state space model in time domain...|$|E

The generating capacities of power plants and application of high voltage has intensively increased due to their inherent advantages, such as, greater efficiency and cost effectiveness.

Out of so many properties of insulation materials, determination of the breakdown voltage continues to evoke {{a lot of interest}} to the Electrical Engineers in general and High Voltage Engineers in particular.

Some of the few important topics reviewed at the beginning of the thesis are the factors affecting the breakdown voltage in general, breakdown voltage study of different composite insulating materials and the factors affecting the breakdown voltage due to Partial Discharges (PD) in voids...|$|E

In Hungary the Hungarian Meteorological Service carried out expedition wind measurements withSODAR equipment to study wind potential of the country within a frame of a scientific competition. We analysed SODAR data from Budapest, Paks and Szeged with statistical method looking for answerto our following question: How can frequency distributions of wind speed and wind direction indifferent height change? Are there any differences in form of wind profiles and in wind power indifferent wind direction sector? How can daily course of wind speed and potential of wind energy indifferent height change? At the same time, we suppose that there is a so-called “inflection altitude,”where the daily course of the wind speed and wind energy is random. We try to determine this altitudeon the basis of tower measurements in Paks. Finally we get an example to the distribution of specificwind power according to parts of the day...|$|E
