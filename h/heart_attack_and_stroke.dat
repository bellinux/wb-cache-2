5|$|On 9 July 2015, the FDA {{toughened}} {{warnings of}} increased <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> <b>stroke</b> {{risk associated with}} nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). Aspirin is an NSAID but is not affected by the new warnings.|$|E
5|$|USFDA-commissioned {{studies from}} 2011 {{indicate}} that in children, young adults, and adults {{there is no}} association between serious adverse cardiovascular events (sudden death, <b>heart</b> <b>attack,</b> <b>and</b> <b>stroke)</b> and the medical use of amphetamine or other ADHD stimulants. However, amphetamine pharmaceuticals are contraindicated in individuals with cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|However, {{several of}} the new COX-2 inhibitors, such as rofecoxib (Vioxx), have been {{withdrawn}} in the last decade, after evidence emerged that PTGS2 inhibitors {{increase the risk of}} <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> <b>stroke.</b> Endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express PTGS2, and, by selectively inhibiting PTGS2, prostaglandin production (specifically, PGI2; prostacyclin) is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels, as PTGS1 in platelets is unaffected. Thus, the protective anticoagulative effect of PGI2 is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new PTGS once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference with reversible inhibitors.|$|E

25|$|The APPROVe {{study was}} {{terminated}} early when the preliminary {{data from the}} study showed an increased relative risk of adverse thrombotic cardiovascular events (including <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> <b>stroke),</b> beginning after 18 months of rofecoxib therapy. In patients taking rofecoxib, versus placebo, the relative risk of these events was 1.92 (rofecoxib 1.50 events vs placebo 0.78 events per 100 patient years). The results from the first 18 months of the APPROVe study did not show an increased relative risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Moreover, overall and cardiovascular mortality rates were similar between the rofecoxib and placebo populations.|$|E

25|$|On September 30, 2004, Merck withdrew rofecoxib {{from the}} market because of {{concerns}} about increased risk of <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> <b>stroke</b> associated with long-term, high-dosage use. Merck withdrew the drug after disclosures that it withheld information about rofecoxib's risks from doctors and patients for over five years, resulting in between 88,000 and 140,000 cases of serious heart disease. Rofecoxib {{was one of the most}} widely used drugs ever to be withdrawn {{from the market}}. In the year before withdrawal, Merck had sales revenue of US$2.5 billion from Vioxx. Merck reserved $970 million to pay for its Vioxx-related legal expenses through 2007, and has set aside $4.85bn for legal claims from US citizens.|$|E
25|$|A {{similar study}} among 12,275,033 Swiss found the highest {{mortality}} {{on the actual}} birthday (17% greater than the expected value), and the effect was largest for those over 80; another study on Swiss data found a 13.8% excess {{and was able to}} link this to specific causes: <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> <b>stroke</b> (predominant in women) and suicides and accidents (predominant in men), as well as an increase in cancer deaths. Among 25 million Americans who died between 1998 and 2011, 6.7% more people than expected die on their birthday, and the effect was most pronounced at weekends and among the young – among 20 to 29 year olds, the excess was over 25%. An even greater excess was found in the population of Kiev, where between 1990 and 2000 there were 44.4% more deaths than expected among men on their birthdays and 36.2% more than expected among women. Smaller biographical studies have also shown a birthday effect within subpopulations, such as among Major League Baseball (MLB) players and people with entries in the Encyclopedia of American History.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, the Women's Health Initiative study (WHI), {{which was}} {{designed}} to demonstrate additional benefits for conventional hormone therapy (study participants were given Prempro or a placebo), was terminated prematurely after preliminary data indicated small increases in the risks of breast cancer, <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> <b>stroke</b> in older women using Prempro. The early termination of the WHI study (which used conjugated equine estrogens) and the subsequent publicity about these previously unappreciated risks led to a decline in prescriptions for CHRT. The results of the WHI were used by BHRT prescribers to promote bioidentical hormones as safer than the FDA-regulated preparations despite a lack of evidence; according to the FDA, the results found by the study apply to all estrogens. BHRT has since been strongly promoted as a natural alternative with fewer risks than CHRT, though {{there is no evidence to}} support this claim. BHRT practitioners recommend compounded products due to their claim that they more closely mimic the composition and ratio of circulating hormones in a woman's body than do commercially manufactured products.|$|E

500|$|Douglas Jackson Brooks (born June 19, 1956), known professionally as Doug Stone, is an American {{country music}} singer. He debuted in 1990 {{with the single}} [...] "I'd Be Better Off (In a Pine Box)", the first release from his 1990 self-titled debut album for Epic Records. Both this album and its successor, 1991's I Thought It Was You, earned a {{platinum}} certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. Two more albums for Epic, 1992's From the Heart and 1994's More Love, are each certified gold. Stone moved to Columbia Records to record Faith in Me, Faith in You, which did not produce a Top Ten among its three singles. After suffering a <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> <b>stroke</b> in the late 1990s, he exited the label and did not release another album until Make Up in Love in 1999 on Atlantic Records. The Long Way was released in 2002 on the Audium label (now part of E1 Music), followed by two albums on the independent Lofton Creek Records.|$|E

2500|$|The {{results of}} the VIGOR study were {{submitted}} to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2001. In September 2001, the FDA sent a warning letter to the CEO of Merck, stating, [...] "Your promotional campaign discounts {{the fact that in}} the VIGOR study, patients on Vioxx were observed to have a four to five fold increase in myocardial infarctions (MIs) compared to patients on the comparator non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), Naprosyn (naproxen)." [...] This led to the introduction, in April 2002, of warnings on Vioxx labeling concerning the increased risk of cardiovascular events (<b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> <b>stroke).</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 2002 the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) was published. [...] That study {{looked at}} the effects of {{hormonal}} replacement therapy in post-menopausal women. Both age groups had a slightly higher incidence of breast cancer, and both <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>and</b> <b>stroke</b> were increased in older patients, although not in younger participants. In fact, the use of hormone therapy in the United States has actually dropped greatly since 2002. Progesterone is the major anabolic hormone for breast tissue, and accordingly breast cancer was not increased in patients who were on estrogen therapy alone after hysterectomy. Treatment with unopposed estrogen (the supplementation of endogenous estrogens without a progestogen) is contraindicated if the uterus is still present, due its proliferative effect on the endometrium. The WHI also found a reduced incidence of colorectal cancer when estrogen and progesterone were used together, and most importantly, a reduced incidence of bone fractures. [...] Ultimately, the study found disparate results for all cause mortality with hormone replacement, finding it to be lower when HRT was begun during ages 50–59, but higher when begun after age 60. Some findings of the WHI were reconfirmed in a larger national study done in the UK, known as The Million Women Study. Coverage of the WHI findings led {{to a reduction in}} the number of post-menopausal women on hormone replacement therapy. The authors of the study recommended that women with non-surgical menopause take the lowest feasible dose of HRT, and for the shortest possible time, to minimize risk.|$|E
