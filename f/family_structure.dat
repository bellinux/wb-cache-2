The 1965 report by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, known as The Moynihan Report, examined the link between black poverty and <b>family</b> <b>structure.</b> It hypothesized that the destruction of the Black nuclear <b>family</b> <b>structure</b> would hinder further progress toward economic and political equality.|$|E
5|$|Historically, among certain Asian and Native American {{cultures}} the <b>family</b> <b>structure</b> {{consisted of}} a grandmother and her children, especially daughters, who raised their own children together and shared child care responsibilities. Uncles, brothers, and other male relatives sometimes helped out. Romantic relationships {{between men and women}} were formed and dissolved with little impact on the children who remained in the mother's extended family.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} <b>family</b> <b>structure</b> in the United States {{is considered}} a family support system involving two married individuals providing care and stability for their biological offspring. However, this two-parent, nuclear family has become less prevalent, and alternative family forms have become more common. The family is created at birth and establishes ties across generations. Those generations, the extended family of aunts, uncles, grandparents, and cousins, can hold significant emotional and economic roles for the nuclear family.|$|E

40|$|Multicultural {{literature}} {{is a tool}} that should be utilized within the classroom {{in order to help}} students see themselves and their own <b>family</b> <b>structures</b> reflected within the writings. This study examines the question: how the use of multicultural texts based on <b>family</b> <b>structures</b> influences children’s perceptions of family. Questionnaires, informal observations, discussions, and students written responses were methods utilized to gain an understanding of the students’ personal perceptions of family. The findings showed that the participants had preconceived ideas of family and after reading the texts student’s personal perceptions were impacted. The implications demonstrated that educators must expose students to multicultural literature and a scaffold discussion following the reading is imperative to furthering students’ knowledge and understanding of <b>family</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R
5|$|Robert Frank, a {{professor}} of child development at Oakton Community College in Illinois, conducted a study comparing households with a stay-at-home dad and households with a stay-at-home mom. His study concluded that women were still able to form a strong bond with their children despite working full-time outside the home. Also, women working full-time were often more engaged with their children {{on a day-to-day basis}} than their male counterparts. His study concluded that in a family with a stay-at-home dad arrangement, the maternal and paternal influences are equally strong. This contrasts with the more traditional <b>family</b> <b>structure</b> where the father works outside the home and the mother stays home with the children. In this type of arrangement, the mother's influence is extremely strong, whereas the father's is relatively small. The study found that both parents play an equal role in a child's development, but the stay-at-home dad arrangement is the most beneficial for the child.|$|E

Resonance reactions take place when the incident de Broglie wave synchronizes with the Poincaré cycle of the compound nucleus, which is composed of several normal modes with periods that are time quantized by inverse Fermi energy. Based on the breathing model of the compound nucleus, neutron resonance energies in <b>family</b> <b>structures</b> are written by simple arithmetic expressions using Sn and small integers. <b>Family</b> <b>structures</b> in observed resonances of 40 Ca+n and 37 Cl+n are described as simple cases.

25|$|More {{women are}} living in poverty due {{to changes in the}} {{traditional}} <b>family</b> <b>structure.</b> The increase in divorce rates and single parenthood are two major contributing factors to change in the <b>family</b> <b>structure.</b> Female-headed families have the poorest economic outcomes, with economic well-being dependent on the mother’s marital status and race/ethnicity. White women generally have access to other income, through marriage or relationships with the highest income earners: white men. Whereas black women, in comparison to white women, are less likely to have white men as partners, and tend to have partners who earn less than white males, even when equally employed. The absence of second income-earning adults is what, in some cases,impedes the well-being of minority women and children.|$|E

At Time 1, 2536 women and 2441 men responded to a survey. A year later, 1529 women and 1421 men responded to a repeated data collection. <b>Family</b> <b>structures</b> were found to predict women's and men's managerial advancement and women's not men's employment disruption, and to lead to them rather than the reverse. Childless single men and women advanced the least, and single parents also had reduced advancement. Traditional fathers advanced as much as other men, although more than posttraditional fathers in some subsamples. Mothers with employed spouses advanced as much as other women. The effects on employment disruption were not consistent with explaining the effects of <b>family</b> <b>structures</b> on advancement...|$|R

25|$|The {{separation}} {{of men and}} women meant that women were forced to wait long periods to have children and get married. This lengthened the timeline of independence for single women and impacted the Japanese-Canadian community after internment by creating more independent women, both of which disrupted the pre-internment way of life. Young children were forced to step up and take on more responsibilities when fathers were taken away. Accounts from children in internment camps recall the impact not having a father. One girl recalls how her sister went from being a pampered eldest child to being a head of household in their father's absence. This was disruptive to the typical <b>family</b> <b>structure</b> because not only was a child in charge, but it was a girl. Transitions such as these gave women a much greater power within the <b>family</b> <b>structure</b> and gave children more adult responsibilities.|$|E
25|$|Cousin {{marriage}} {{has often been}} chosen to keep cultural values intact, preserve family wealth, maintain geographic proximity, keep tradition, strengthen family ties, and maintain <b>family</b> <b>structure</b> or a closer relationship between the wife and her in-laws.

25|$|<b>Family</b> <b>structure</b> (how {{the family}} is organized) {{historically}} has been influenced by social-level forces, many of them economic.

Children were seen {{as a method of}} ensuring the passage of political and economic power to future generations.|$|E

In the case of Elfriede Jelinek’s play, we explore its sources (both in Schiller’s eponymous tragedy and in popular discourses on terrorist "chic") {{in order to assess}} its critique of the family and gender stereotypes underlying the portrayal of the female terrorist. Our discussion of Bernhard Schlink’s novel focuses on the representation of intergenerational conflicts and the question how <b>family</b> <b>structures</b> and emotions may enable former terrorists to reintegrate into society even when {{there is no sign of}} remorse. In both cases, we discuss which aesthetic strategies and <b>family</b> <b>structures</b> both writers use and enact to either prevent or enable cathartic responses to the violence of terrorism...|$|R

Children weren't treated as delicate or protected from sexuality.

40|$|Imaging {{genetics}} is {{an emerging}} methodological field that combines genetic information with medical imaging-derived metrics {{to understand how}} genetic factors impact observable phenotypes.

The Sequential Oligogenic Linkage Analysis Routines (SOLAR) imaging genetics software can estimate the heritability of a trait in complex pedigrees. We investigate the ability of SOLAR to accurately estimate heritability and common environmental effects on simulated imaging phenotypes in various <b>family</b> <b>structures.</b> We found that heritability is reliably estimated with small family-based studies of 40 to 80 individuals, though subtle differences remain between the <b>family</b> <b>structures.</b> In an imaging application analysis, we found that with 80 subjects {{in any of the}} <b>family</b> <b>structures,</b> estimated heritability of white matter fractional anisotropy was biased by < 10...|$|R

25|$|There is {{a strong}} {{correlation}} between the type and age of a household's <b>family</b> <b>structure</b> and homeownership.

Age played a significant role as well with homeownership increasing with the age of the householder until age 65, when a slight decrease becomes visible.
