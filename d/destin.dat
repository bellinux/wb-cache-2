5|$|As Earl tracked {{towards the}} northeastern Gulf of Mexico on September1, a {{hurricane}} warning was issued for coastal areas between Pascagoula, Mississippi and Cameron, Louisiana. Additionally, hurricane watches extended out to <b>Destin,</b> Florida and High Island, Texas from {{the edges of}} the warning respectively. Early the next day, a tropical storm warning was issued for areas between Pascagoula, Mississippi and <b>Destin,</b> Florida. In response to the eastward movement of the hurricane, the hurricane watch and warning was discontinued for areas west of Morgan City, Louisiana. Additionally, the hurricane warning was extended eastward to <b>Destin,</b> Florida, a tropical storm warning was issued east of <b>Destin</b> to Apalachicola, Florida, and a tropical storm watch was declared for areas between Morgan City and Cameron, Louisiana. Several hours later, the hurricane warning was again extended eastward to the mouth of the Suwannee River. All watches and warnings were discontinued for areas west of Pascagoula, Mississippi and due to the asymmetrical structure of Hurricane Earl, a tropical storm warning was issued as far south as the Florida Keys. Continuing uncertainty in the track of Earl prompted the issuance of a hurricane watch and tropical storm warning for areas between Pascagoula, Mississippi and Grand Isle, Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans. After Earl made landfall in Florida, all watches and warnings were discontinued in relation to the storm.|$|E

5|$|The area of low {{pressure}} preceding {{the development of}} Bertha produced rough surf and rip currents along the Florida coastline. In Perdido Key State Recreation Area, two children were swimming in an unguarded area when they swept away by the currents. Their grandfather attempted to rescue them, but drowned in the rough waters. Another family rescued the two children. The large circulation of Bertha produced light rainfall across Florida, with Pensacola and <b>Destin</b> reporting 2.75inches.

5|$|After {{entering}} the southern Gulf of Mexico, Hurricane Ivan weakened to Category4 status by 0600UTC on September 14. As it gradually {{turned to the}} north, southwesterly flow from a large trough over the central United States increased wind shear over the hurricane. An eyewall replacement cycle, along with dry air and restricted outflow, contributed to the weakening. By late on September 14 the weakening trend ceased as the eyewall became better defined, and Ivan was expected to restrengthen slightly over an area of warmer water temperatures. The eye diameter expanded to 60miles (95km/h), though concurrently westerly wind shear and dry air continued to increase. As Ivan approached the Gulf Coast of the United States, Hurricane Hunters reported erosion of the southern portion of the eyewall, and cooler waters just offshore contributed to further weakening. At around 0650UTC on September 16, Hurricane Ivan made landfall just west of Gulf Shores, Alabama with an intensity of 120mph (195km/h); the strongest winds occurred over a narrow area near the southern Alabama and western Florida border. Its landfall {{was accompanied by a}} 10–15feet (3–4.5m) storm surge from <b>Destin,</b> Florida westward to Mobile Bay.|$|E
5|$|Short Term 12 was {{originally}} conceived by <b>Destin</b> Daniel Cretton as a short film {{based on his}} experiences as a line staff worker at a group facility for teenagers where he had worked for two years; it served as his thesis project for his Master's degree in film at San Diego State University. The short film ran for 22minutes and premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival, where it won the Jury Prize in Short Filmmaking. After graduating from film school, Cretton decided to adapt the short into a feature-length screenplay, which won one of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' five Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting in 2010. The largest change Cretton made when adapting the short film into a longer screenplay was changing the lead character's gender: Denim, a man loosely based on Cretton himself, became Grace, a young woman and the facility's supervisor. Cretton researched similar facilities and interviewed former employees for the film, noting that the script featured stories directly told by children in these facilities from his interviews.|$|E
