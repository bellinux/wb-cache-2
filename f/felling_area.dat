40|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} (VOCs) including terpenoids are emitted {{into the atmosphere}} from various natural sources. Damaging the plant tissue is known to strongly increase their monoterpene release. We measured the terpenoid emissions caused by timber felling, i. e. those from stumps and logging residue. The emissions from stumps were studied using enclosures and those from the whole <b>felling</b> <b>area</b> using an ecosystem scale micrometeorological method, disjunct eddy accumulation (DEA). The compounds analyzed were isoprene, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. Strong emissions of monoterpenes were measured from both the stumps and from the whole <b>felling</b> <b>area.</b> The emission rate fell down rapidly within {{few months after the}} logging. In addition to fresh logging residue, the results suggest also other strong monoterpene sources to be present at the <b>felling</b> <b>area.</b> Those could include pre-existing litter, increased microbial activity and remaining undergrowth. To evaluate the possible importance of monoterpenes emitted from cut Scots pine forests in Finland annually, we conducted a rough upscaling. The resulting monoterpene release was about 15 kilotonnes per year which is more than 10 % of the monoterpene release from intact forests in Finland...|$|E

40|$|The ontogenetic {{properties}} of moesian beech seedlings were analysed {{in the first}} vegetation growth period at identical sites, but in different stand conditions based on the divergent values of unique and complex biological characteristics. The seedlings were formed on the deluvium {{at the site of}} montane beech forests (Fagetum moesiacae montanum typicum Jov. 1976) on deep eutric brown soil. The terrain is gently sloped, exposure east-southeast, altitude about 470 m The seedlings from the completely closed part of the stand are the phenotype of the sciomorphic structural form. Their above-ground shoots usually consist of: hypocotyl, cotyledons (or their scars), above-cotyledon internode-epicotyl, a weak (leafless, as a rule), sylleptically formed "above-epicotyl axis", two opposite, primary, leaves and vegetative buds, large terminal and undeveloped in the axyl cotyledons and primary leaves Compared to the conditions in the closed canopy, seedlings on the <b>felling</b> <b>area</b> differ in some biological properties and form a different phenotype In the different environment conditions, the greater significance of differences between identical biological properties is expressed according to the order of their origin. The most expressed differences occur {{in the development of the}} "above-epicotyl axis".

However, bioenergy cannot be infinite, because the land area available for biomass production is limited and a certain amount of biomass must be reserved for food and materials. The purpose of this study is to evaluate global bioenergy potential: for this purpose, the authors developed a global land-use and energy model (GLUE) formulated using a SD (System Dynamics) technique. Through a simulation, the following results were obtained. (1) There will be a certain potential for energy crops harvested from surplus arable land in the developed regions of the world. However, care must be taken because the potential is sensitive to the global food supply and demand. (2) There will be a large bioenergy potential for biomass residues, such as cereal-harvesting residues, animal dung, roundwood felling residues, and timber scrap. The ultimate bioenergy potential, from all the biomass residues, will be 277 EJ/yr in A. D. 2100 in the world. (3) The mature-forest area in the developing regions decreases from 2. 1 billion ha in 1990 to 0. 8 billion ha in 2100, although it is assumed that the <b>felling</b> <b>area</b> is reforested completely after A.

The work is part of a long-term vision in the forest industry of developing an unmanned shuttle that transports timber from the <b>felling</b> <b>area</b> to the main roads for further transportation. A new path-tracking algorithm is introduced and demonstrated as superior to standard algorithms, such as Follow the Carrot and Pure Pursuit.

40|$|Cut-to-length logging (CTL) is a {{mechanized}} {{harvesting process}} where trees are delimbed {{and cut to}} length directly at the stump. CTL is typically a two-man, two-machine operation with a harvester felling, delimbing, and bucking trees, and a forwarder transporting the cut logs from the <b>felling</b> <b>area</b> to a landing area accessible by trucks, or trains. The main challenges for the manufacturers of forestry machines for CTL logging are to address new customer demands and tougher ergonomic and environmental legislations by finding means that: (1) further increase the harvesting and log transportation productivity, e. g. by enabling operation on eco-soils, (2) reduce {{the damage to the}} soil, e. g. by controlling the rut depth and preserving the root layer, (3) reduce exhaust emissions, e. g. by reducing the rolling resistance and evening the contact and tractive forces between all traction units and ground, and (4) reduce the daily vibration dosage for the machine operators, e. g. with efficient chassis and cabin suspension solutions. This paper presents a model-based study of a novel tracked medium-sized forestry machine. The machine is a standard eight-wheeled forwarder of bogie type with the four bogies replaced with four passively suspended track units adapted from an off-road military vehicle.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{quantify}} the energy consumption and emission production of the fuel supply system for a typical Swedish biofueled CHP plant. A model, useful also for other studies of CHP plant fuel supply systems, was developed and used for the calculations. Input data was collected from a plant situated some 100 km from Stockholm in Sweden. Important fuel materials are chips from limbs and tops, by-products from saw mills and chips from willow. The {{results show that the}} materials that are by-products from other production processes, for example saw dust and saw mill chips, are very favourable in terms of the studied environmental parameters. The environmental load for the supply of chips from limbs and tops is 5 - 8 times the load for the by-products. The use of a terminal for temporary storage of means that additional transport and loading operations are necessary and gives a 30 % load increase. Further, chipping at the clear <b>felling</b> <b>area</b> results in somewhat larger environmental load than chipping at the roadside. Calculations were also done in order to study the effects of different changes in the supply system. One important result of these calculations is that the NOx emissions caused by the system will, due to stricter emission regulations, decrease with up to 70 % within the next 10 - 12 years. The decrease of the fuel consumption and the amounts of emissions produced will, however, be much smaller...|$|E

The work {{is part of}} a long-term vision in the forest industry of developing an unmanned shuttle that transports timber from the <b>felling</b> <b>area</b> to the main roads for further transportation. The developed prototype system has two modes of operation: Path Learning, in which the human operator drives or remote controls the vehicle along a selected path {{back and forth from the}} area of felling to the transportation road. In this phase, position, speed, heading, and the operator’s commands are recorded in the vehicle computer. When the vehicle has been loaded with timber the operator activates Path Tracking mode, which means that the vehicle autonomously drives along the recorded path to the transportation road. A new path-tracking algorithm is introduced, and is demonstrated as superior to standard algorithms, such as Follow the Carrot and Pure Pursuit. This is accomplished by using the recorded data from the path-learning phase. By using the recorded steering angle, the curvature of the path is automatically included in the final steering command. Localization is accomplished by fusing data from Real-Time Kinematic Differential GPS/GLONASS, gyro, wheel odometry, and laser odometry. The laser odometry algorithm works by using consecutive scans to estimate the pose change (position and heading). A search is conducted in pose space to find the optimal fit between the two scans.

To anticipate those obstacles two engineering designs of the skyline system had been tried, the so called Expo- 2000 Generation- 1, using gasoline engine of 6 HP (G- 1), and Expo- 2000 Generation- 3 using diesel engine of 12 HP (G- 3). G- 1 model has been tested in Cimeong and Rancaparang in 2011. G- 3 model has been examined in Cibatu Canjur and Cibaliung Banten in 2013. This paper evaluates the modification of skyline system for steep terrain and to compare the performance between two modified skyline systems, in term of productivity and cost. The data collected included working time, log volume extracted, log extraction distance and fuel used. Data were analyzed to get the average productivity and cost of operation.

This study investigates the time consumptions on specific work elements in timber skidding, develops time prediction models for timber skidding work elements and assesses the production rates for timber skidding in reduced accessibility stands where windthrow salvage cuttings were applied. Following a time study done for two skidders (TAF 690 OP and TAF 657) operating simultaneously in the same <b>felling</b> <b>area,</b> {{it has been found}} that, in average, in a delay free skidding cycle time, lateral winching accounted for a share of 26 - 33 %, on-trail skidding accounted for a share of 64 - 71 % and landing operations accounted for a share of 3 %. Total delays accounted for 51 % and 43 % of the total work time in the case of TAF 690 OP skidder and TAF 657 skidder respectively. Regression models for lateral winching (both skidders) revealed that the winching distance and the number of logs were the relevant predictors for the time consumption estimation (p < 0. 01), whereas in the case of on-trail skidding only the skidding distance was relevant (p < 0. 01). For the overall skidding operation (excluding landing operations) winching and skidding distances were found as relevant predictors (p < 0. 01) in case of TAF 690 OP, whereas the number of logs became an additional relevant predictor in case of TAF 657. In conditions of an average winching distance of 19. 90 m and an average on-trail skidding distance of 980. 32 m, the time study yielded a net production rate of 7. 70 m 3 h- 1 and a gross production rate of 3. 75 m 3 h- 1 in the case of TAF 690 OP skidder.

Analysis of the number of trees of particular categories according to the type of felling (stand age) and diameter class was carried out with the aim of finding the answers to questions pertaining to the criteria of assignment of one type of felling, as well as the degree of damage to stands during the exploiting of forest in the area subject to research. The assigned trees of group A (undamaged trees of normal growth) have, on the whole, extremely positive influence on assortment structure of particular type of felling. To these we can, to a certain extent, join pregrowth trees, i. e. group G, whose influence is limited mostly to thinning felling. Trees of all the other described groups have more or less negative effect on assortment structure of particular type of felling. The influence of suppressed trees (group H) on assortment structure is insignificant, and their importance for successful carrying out of seeding felling is considerable. The percentage of trees with positive influence on assortment structure according to the type of felling, stands about 50 % in thinning and preparatory felling, while in seeding and final felling it is about 60 %. Trees of medium diameter and large diameter, i. e. trees of diameter class between 41 cm and 60 cm, and those with breast diameter over 61 cm, have the greatest influence on the whole of tree assortment structure or particular types of felling. The reason for that is the fact that only those trees can potentially contain timber assortment of the highest quality (according to Croatian Standards of Forest Exploitation Products from 1995) because of the minimal dimensions prescribed for timber assortments of the highest quality. Percentage of those trees with positive and negative influence on assortment structure is almost identical in case of thinning and preparatory felling, while in case of seeding and final felling the share of trees with positive effect is considerably higher than the percentage of trees with negative effect on assortment structure. It can be said that the percentage of trees with breast diameter larger than 41 cm, with the positive effect on assortment structure grows from 5. 7 % in thinning felling to 57. 5 % in final felling. If we focus on the relation (difference) between the trees with breast diameter larger than 41 cm, with positive and negative effect on assortment structure, we can easily say that this value ranges from – 2. 9 % in thinning felling to 22. 9 % in final felling. Trees damaged {{as a result of our}} activities, or human influence, are contained within groups with description marks of C, D, E and I. The percentage of trees damaged by human activity increases from thinning felling to final felling. For thinning felling, this percentage amounts to 11. 2 %, for preparatory felling it is 13. 1 %, for seeding felling it is 15. 8 %, while for final felling it amounts to 23. 3 % of damaged trees. The increase in participation of trees damaged in that way towards the end of rotation can be attributed to intensifying of exploitation of forests at the time of seeding felling. However, as much as 23. 3 % of damaged trees out of the assigned trees of final felling, i. e. almost one quarter of more or less damaged trees left for final felling, is the information which calls for some concern. The quality of assortment structure of stand varies within a large scope and depends on different kinds of influence, from timely and high-quality cultivation activities, over influence of habitats, to the extreme abiotic influences of accidental character. Assortment structure of beech stands is the focus of our interest only in the sense of increasing the overall quality of beech trees, i. e. achieving the largest possible percentage of high-quality beech trees in the stand. The percentage of timber assortments in beech stands of particular age (except for final felling and clear felling) is not our primary interest. The primary interest of forestry operational bodies (as well as science) is the quality and quantity of timber assortments that can be achieved through carrying out of particular type of felling, i. e. assortment structure of <b>felling</b> <b>area.</b> The share of timber assortments of particular type of felling is to a great extent a result of our decisions during the selection of trees for felling, by which we pursue the aim and the guidelines of stand management. The principles (rules) we apply while assigning trees for particular type of felling lead us to “save” the high-quality trees for the end of the rotation (seeding felling, final felling). Having that in mind, it is to be expected that the percentage of the timber assortments of the highest quality (within the same diameter class) will increase from thinning felling towards final felling. For that reason it is necessary to distinguish between the assortment structure of stand and the assortment structure of <b>felling</b> <b>area</b> (specific types of felling). The assortment structure of stand varies within a wide and unknown scope, and its quality is the result of the success of our management in the past. Only in that sense does the assortment structure of stand influence the assortment structure of <b>felling</b> <b>area.</b> The increase in percentage shares of high-quality timber assortments according to diameter classes from thinning felling to final felling is a pattern determined by our decisions, i. e. expert conduct of cultivation activities of assigning trees for felling. This pattern is constant in the same measure as the principles of management and the manner of their implementation are constant...|$|E
40|$|U radu je istraživana vjerojatnost pojave drvnih sortimenata tehničke oblovine u bukovim stablima s obzirom na vrstu sijeka, kao i razlike između postotnih udjela drvnih sortimenata tehničke oblovine po debljinskim stupnjevima i vrsti sijeka. Postotni udjeli tehničke oblovine određeni ovim istraživanjem uspoređeni su s planskim vrijednostima (sortimentnim tablicama) koje se primjenjuju u šumarskoj operativi. Na temelju rezultata istraživanja izrađene su nove sortimentne tablice prema Hrvatskim normama proizvoda iskorištavanja šuma od 1995. godine. Istraživanja su provedena na uzorku koji obuhvaća 787 stabala u proredama, 1025 stabala u pripremnim, 606 stabala u naplodnim i 583 stabala u dovršnim sjekovima. Sveukupno je istraživanjima obuhvaćeno 3001 primjerno stablo. Starost istraživanih sječina iznosila je od 59 do 91 godinu kod prethodnog prihoda (proreda), od 94 do 110 godina kod pripremnog sijeka, od 100 do 112 godina kod naplodnog sijeka te od 98 do 112 godina kod dovršnog sijeka. Dosadašnji je pristup određivanju sortimentne strukture jednodobnih bukovih sastojina u velikoj mjeri pogrešan. Operativne sortimentne tablice daju previsoke procjene za najkvalitetnije drvne sortimente svih vrsta sjekova osim zadnjih sjekova oplodnih bukovih sječina. Tablice šumskih drvnih sortimenata koje uvažavaju vrstu sijeka kao jedan od ulaza, omogućuju pouzdaniju procjenu sortimentne strukture sječine i preciznije planiranje sječivog etata. Pri tome su kao čimbenici razdvajanja uzeti kriteriji selekcije prilikom doznake stabala za sječu koji se primjenjuju do uključivo pripremnog sijeka. Iz tih su razloga tablice šumskih drvnih sortimenata izrađene zasebno za prorede i pripremni sijek, a zasebno za naplodni i dovršni sijek. The {{subject of}} {{research}} was probability of appearance of technical roundwood timber assortments in trees according to type of felling, {{as well as}} the difference between shares of technical roundwood timber assortments according to diameter class and type of felling. The percentages of technical roundwood established in this research were compared to the planned values (assortment tables) which are applied in forestry operational bodies. Research was carried out on a sample consisting of 787 trees in thinning felling, 1025 trees in preparatory felling, 606 trees in seeding felling and 583 trees in final felling. An overall number of 3001 exemplary trees were included in the research. The age of the felling areas studied was between 59 and 91 years in the preliminary yield (thinning), 94 to 110 years in preparatory felling, 100 to 112 years in seeding felling, and 98 to 112 years in final felling areas. We think that the approach to establishing the assortment structure of even-aged beech stands taken so far is to a large extent wrong. The operative assortment tables give too high estimates of top quality timber assortments of all types of felling, except the final felling of seeding beech felling areas. Timber assortment tables that take into consideration the type of felling as one of the inputs, enable a more reliable estimate of assortment structure of the <b>felling</b> <b>area</b> and more precise planning of timber mass marked for felling. In this case, as a distinguishing factor, we took the selection criterion for marking trees for felling which is applied for the types up to, and including, the preparatory felling. For that reason, timber assortment tables were made separately for thinning and preparatory felling, and separately for seeding and final felling. On the basis of the research results, new assortment tables were made according to Croatian Standards of Forest Exploitation Products from 1995. Seeding and final felling show by ca 8 – 14 % higher shares of top quality timber assortment (F and L) than thinning and preparatory felling. On the other side, thinning and preparatory felling show by ca 4 – 15 % higher shares of technical roundwood assortment of lower quality (second-class and third-class) than seeding and final felling...|$|E
