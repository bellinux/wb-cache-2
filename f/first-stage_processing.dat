5|$|Responsibility for {{the design}} and {{construction}} of the electromagnetic separation plant, which {{came to be called}} Y-12, was assigned to Stone & Webster by the S-1 Committee in June 1942. The design called for five <b>first-stage</b> <b>processing</b> units, known as Alpha racetracks, and two units for final processing, known as Beta racetracks. In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II. Construction began in February 1943.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for {{the design}} and {{construction}} of the electromagnetic separation plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which {{came to be called}} Y-12, was assigned to Stone & Webster. The design called for five <b>first-stage</b> <b>processing</b> units, known as Alpha racetracks, and two units for final processing, known as Beta racetracks. In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II. When the plant was started up for testing on schedule in October 1943, the 14-ton vacuum tanks crept out of alignment because {{of the power of the}} magnets, and had to be fastened more securely. A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started shorting out. In December Groves ordered a magnet to be broken open, and handfuls of rust were found inside. Groves then ordered the racetracks to be torn down and the magnets sent back to the factory to be cleaned. A pickling plant was established on-site to clean the pipes and fittings.|$|E

50|$|Senegal's total horticultural {{production}} {{was estimated at}} 584,000 MT in 2004. Exports {{of fruits and vegetables}} are growing steady although they remain low, and it is estimated that they will reach approximately 50,000 tons in 2007. Europe is still the main export market for Senegal's fresh fruits and vegetables. About 70% of the European market is dominated by four products including green beans, cherry tomato, mango and melon. With the increase in size and value of the European market, pre-packed produce such as green beans have promising prospects in the European market and with the possibility to introduce <b>first-stage</b> <b>processing,</b> these produce will likely reach other markets. Under AGOA and its related projects, Senegal's horticultural sector is making efforts to enter the U.S and North American markets.|$|E
5000|$|The Metals Service Center Institute (MSCI) is a trade {{association}} and nonprofit {{organization based in}} Rolling Meadows, Illinois, in the United States. It was established as the American Horseshoe and Heavy Hardware Association in 1909 and was subsequently known as the American Steel Warehouse Association, then the Steel Service Center Institute. The organization's members are primarily metal service centers that inventory and distribute metals for industrial customers and perform <b>first-stage</b> <b>processing.</b> MSCI has approximately 400 members operating from 1,500 locations primarily in North America. MSCI members purchase about 75 million tons of steel, aluminum and other metals from metals producers, with 300,000 customers, primarily businesses in manufacturing and fabrication. The organization formerly produced the trade publication Forward Magazine and issues a monthly [...] "Metals Activity Report".|$|E

3000|$|The movie then {{constitutes}} the input into our system. The MF with the estimated covariance matrix is {{applied for the}} <b>first-stage</b> <b>processing</b> of each hypercube, and the temporal processing algorithm described in section [...] "System architecture" [...] {{is used for the}} target detection in the second stage. The output of the second stage {{constitutes the}} input into the DPA. The DPA allows us to track the target from pixel to pixel; an updated summation score for each pixel is kept for each pixel, based on its similarity to expected target behavior. Penalties are introduced to lower the score of pixels apparently acting in a non-physical manner. In the final stage, the last processed frame is taken and the highest pixel is declared as a [...] "target" [...] and its track is found. In this section, we will define three tests to evaluate the effect of each stage of the algorithm.|$|E
40|$|We {{address the}} problem of speech {{enhancement}} in real-world noisy scenarios. We propose to solve the problem in two stages, the first comprising a generalized spectral subtraction technique, followed by a sequence of perceptually-motivated post-processing algorithms. The role of the post-processing algorithms is to compensate for the effects of noise as well as to suppress any artifacts created by the <b>first-stage</b> <b>processing.</b> The key post-processing mechanisms are aimed at suppressing musical noise and to enhance the formant structure of voiced speech as well as to denoise the linear-prediction residual. The parameter values in the techniques are fixed optimally by experimentally evaluating the enhancement performance {{as a function of the}} parameters. We used the Carnegie-Mellon university Arctic database for our experiments. We considered three real-world noise types: fan noise, car noise, and motorbike noise. The enhancement performance was evaluated by conducting listening experiments on 12 subjects. The listeners reported a clear improvement (MOS improvement of 0. 5 on an average) over the noisy signal in the perceived quality (increase in the mean-opinion score (MOS)) for positive signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs). For negative SNRs, however, the improvement was found to be marginal...|$|E
