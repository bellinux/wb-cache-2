5|$|When Hillyar's {{squadron}} {{arrived at}} Port Louis, Captain Schomberg immediately assumed command {{and led the}} squadron out again on 14 May, following the French eastwards. <b>Heading</b> <b>straight</b> for Tamatave, the only resupply point between Bourbon and the Cape of Good Hope, Schomberg rapidly gained on the French and when dawn broke on 20 May the French were {{within sight of the}} harbour. During the day, both commanders were frustrated by light winds and periods of calm in which none of the ships were able to move. Roquebert completed resupplying his ships at 12:00 and pulled away from the harbour in battle line, Clorinde followed by Renommée and Néréide while the British, although initially intending to form a line with Astraea at its head, gradually broke into a loose formation created by the vagaries of the wind.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the attack, Godsal and Lynes had carefully consulted available charts of Ostend following the previous operation's failure caused by German repositioning of navigation buoys. This careful study was, however, rendered worthless by a sudden fog which obliterated all sight of the shore. Steaming {{back and forth across}} the harbour entrance in the fog as the monitors and German shore batteries engaged in a long range artillery duel over the lost cruiser, Godsal looked for the piers marking the entrance to the canal. As he searched, two German torpedo boats sailed from Ostend to intercept the cruiser, but in the heavy fog they collided and, disabled, limped back to shore. During this period, Godsal's motor launches lost track of the cruiser in the murk, and it was not until the third pass that Vindictive found the entrance, accompanied by only one of the launches. <b>Heading</b> <b>straight</b> into the mouth of the canal, guided by a flare dropped by the launch, Vindictive became an instant target of the German batteries and was badly damaged, the shellfire exacerbating the damage suffered in the earlier Zeebrugge Raid and seriously damaging Vindictives port propeller.|$|E

Peters, who had experience in running previous scientific expeditions, became the commander and remained in that position for the rest of the charter period. Following some modifications, carried out under the supervision of J.F. Pratt, the Galilee set sail on the second cruise on March 2, 1906, <b>heading</b> <b>straight</b> to Fanning Island. The cruise continued to Pago Pago on Tutuila, part of the Samoan islands, where neither swings nor shore observations proved possible.|$|E
25|$|Graf's {{schedule}} was closely controlled by her father, who limited her play {{so that she}} would not burn out. In 1985, for instance, she played only 10 events leading up to the US Open, whereas another up-and-coming star, Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina, who was a year younger than Graf, played 21. Peter also kept a tight rein on Graf's personal life. Social invitations on the tour were often declined as Graf's focus was kept on practicing and match play. Working with her father and then-coach Pavel Složil, Graf typically practiced for up to four hours a day, often <b>heading</b> <b>straight</b> from airports to practice courts. This narrow focus meant that Graf, already shy and retiring by nature, made few friends on the tour in her early years, but it led to a steady improvement in her play.|$|E
25|$|On 15 February {{when the}} British {{surrendered}} at Singapore, the Japanese pincers closed on Java. A fleet of 41 transports originating at Jolo in the Philippines were <b>heading</b> <b>straight</b> down the Makassar Strait and, after a single stop at Balikpapan, moved {{out across the}} Java Sea. A second fleet, even larger, was coming {{down out of the}} China Sea around the western curve of Borneo against Batavia and Western Java. The men on the bomber fields in Java received the news of Singapore's surrender as forewarning of their own defeat. Attacks were flown against the fleets heading towards Java, but the Joint Army-Navy Assessment Commission credited the Army airplanes of all Allied Air forces in the theater with no more than three minesweepers, four passenger or cargo vessels, and one converted salvage vessel sunk, and a part in the sinking of two other cargo vessels.|$|E

25|$|MD 564 {{begins at}} a partial {{interchange}} with MD 450 (Annapolis Road) in Lanham. There is no access from westbound MD 450 to eastbound MD 564 or from westbound MD 564 to eastbound MD 450. Eastbound MD 564 exits from eastbound MD 450, passes under MD 450, and meets westbound MD 564 at an intersection where <b>heading</b> <b>straight</b> leads to Cipriano Road. The two directions of MD 564 {{come together as}} Lanham Severn Road, a two-lane road heading northeast paralleling the Amtrak Northeast Corridor and MARC's Penn Line at a distance. The state highway crosses Baldhill Branch and passes through the unincorporated community of Seabrook, where the road intersects Seabrook Road and passes the Seabrook MARC station. After passing through a commercial area in Seabrook, MD 564 passes several industrial properties on the railroad side of the highway. The state highway enters Glenn Dale, where the highway temporarily expands to a four-lane divided highway for intersections with Glenn Dale Road (unsigned MD 953A) and MD 193 (Glenn Dale Boulevard).|$|E
25|$|Many {{sources have}} {{suggested}} that Sergeant Cedric Popkin was the person {{most likely to have}} killed Richthofen, including a 1998 article by Geoffrey Miller, a physician and historian of military medicine, and a 2002 British Channel 4 documentary. Popkin was an anti-aircraft (AA) machine gunner with the Australian 24th Machine Gun Company, and he was using a Vickers gun. He fired at Richthofen's aircraft on two occasions: first as the Baron was <b>heading</b> <b>straight</b> at his position, and then at long range from the right. Given the nature of Richthofen's wounds, Popkin {{was in a position to}} fire the fatal shot when the pilot passed him for a second time, on the right. Some confusion has been caused by a letter that Popkin wrote in 1935 to an Australian official historian. It stated Popkin's belief that he had fired the fatal shot as Richthofen flew straight at his position. In this respect, Popkin was incorrect; the bullet which caused the Baron's death came from the side (see above).|$|E
25|$|The wrong-way car chase on a Los Angeles freeway {{sequence}} {{was one of}} {{the last}} things shot in the film and it took six weeks to shoot. At this point, Friedkin was working with a very stripped down crew. He came up with the idea of staging the chase against the flow of traffic on February 25, 1963 when he was driving home from a wedding in Chicago. He fell asleep at the wheel and woke up in the wrong lane with oncoming traffic <b>heading</b> <b>straight</b> for him. He swerved back to his side of the road and for the next 20 years wondered how he was going to use it in a film. He told stunt coordinator Buddy Joe Hooker that if they could come up with a chase better than the one in The French Connection then it would be in the film. If not, he would not use it. Petersen did a lot of his own driving during this sequence and actor John Pankow's stressed out reactions were real. Three weekends were spent on sections of the Terminal Island Freeway near Wilmington, California that were closed for four hours at a time to allow the crew to stage the chaotic chase. With delays, the film ran a reported $1 million over budget.|$|E

25|$|The 33rd and {{its sister}} regiments {{advanced}} cautiously toward the Federals, who by now {{had opened up}} on them from {{the far side of}} the field, with the Confederates returning fire. At one point about halfway across, the commander of the 16th Alabama ordered his regiment to halt; Adams ordered the 33rd to stop, as well. The two regiments resumed their advance after about ten minutes or so, though in the darkness they now had to deal with stragglers firing on them from behind, as well as the enemy shooting at them to their front. One incident of friendly fire claimed the life of Lieutenant Alfred Moore: he was accidentally shot in the neck from behind by a straggler, who was roundly cursed by his comrades and ordered to cease fire. A few companies of the 33rd began to fall back, but Adams quickly corralled them and got them back into the fight. With the attack beginning to stall, artillery batteries were brought up in the darkness together with supporting troops under Brigadier General John Jackson; these finally drove the Federals back, with the 33rd Alabama crossing their breastworks on {{the far side of the}} field, and <b>heading</b> <b>straight</b> for the nearby 6th Indiana.|$|E

40|$|Inspiratory {{pressures}} {{were measured}} at three {{levels in the}} upper airways and in the oesophagus in different sleeping positions. Thirty one consecutive healthy infants were examined {{at the age of}} 1 - 3 days, 25 of these at 6 weeks, and 23 at 12 weeks. Oxygen saturation, an electrocardiogram, transthoracic impedance, nasal airflow, and inspiratory pressure in the epipharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and in the intrathoracic part of the oesophagus were measured. There was no significant change in the heart rate, oxygen saturation, or respiratory rate in the four sleeping positions. The peak negative inspiratory pressures obtained from the oesophagus (PES) were significantly lower in the supine <b>head</b> <b>straight</b> compared with the supine head turned and the prone positions. At 6 weeks, the only significant difference was between the supine <b>head</b> <b>straight</b> and the prone positions. The PES is less negative at all ages in the supine <b>head</b> <b>straight</b> than in all other sleeping positions, but this does not reach statistical significance...|$|R

Then, the train made a slight right turn <b>heading</b> <b>straight</b> into a wall before entering a Cobra roll. After a straight section of track, the train enters the second former near-miss point with the other train, a vertical loop. The train then made a right turn into the final former near-miss point, a corkscrew. Next, the train made a right turn followed by a left turn leading into the final brake run. Following a right turn, the train returns to the station where the riders unload and the next riders load.|$|E
