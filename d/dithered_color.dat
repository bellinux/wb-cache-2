40|$|Image {{quantization}} {{and digital}} halftoning are fundamental problems in computer graphics, which arise when displaying high-color images on non-truecolor devices. Both steps are generally performed sequentially and, in most cases, independent of each other. Color quantization with a pixel-wise defined distortion measure and the dithering process with its local neighborhood optimize different quality criteria or, frequently, follow a heuristic {{without reference to}} any quality measure. In this {{paper we propose a}} new method to simultaneously quantize and dither color images. The method is based on a rigorous cost [...] function approach which optimizes a quality criterion derived from a generic model of human perception. A highly efficient algorithm for optimization based on a multiscale method is developed for the <b>dithered</b> <b>color</b> quantization cost function. The quality criterion and the optimization algorithms are evaluated on a representative set of artificial and real [...] world images as [...] ...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{interesting}} problems of digital image processing is how much the color table can be reduced without any detectable difference {{in the quality of}} an image. The process of reducing the color information is known as quantizing. Often visible artifacts, such as false contours, appear in a quantized image. Digital halftoning or spatial dithering is a process which tries to reduce the visibility of quantization errors. A new method, called n-best, is presented for <b>dithering</b> <b>color</b> images. This method adds noise that is proportional to the quantization error at each pixel. The n-best algorithm {{turns out to be a}} good compromise between the efficiency and the quality of the produced image. Keywords: digital halftoning, dithering, quantization 1 Introduction Quantizing is an interesting problem in the area of computer graphics from both theoretical and practical point of view. The aim of quantizing is to decrease the number of colors without any disturbing effect to human eye. Quanti [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|Dithering {{is used in}} {{computer}} graphics {{to create the illusion}} of [...] "color depth" [...] in images with a limited color palette - a technique also known as color quantization. In a <b>dithered</b> image, <b>colors</b> that are not available in the palette are approximated by a diffusion of colored pixels from within the available palette. The human eye perceives the diffusion as a mixture of the colors within it (see <b>color</b> vision). <b>Dithered</b> images, particularly those with relatively few colors, can often be distinguished by a characteristic graininess or speckled appearance.|$|R
50|$|When using indexed color techniques, {{real life}} images are {{represented}} with better {{fidelity to the}} truecolor original one by using adaptive palettes (sometimes spelled adaptative palettes), in which the colors are selected or quantized through some algorithm directly from the original image (by picking the most frequent colors). This way, and with further <b>dithering,</b> the indexed <b>color</b> image can nearly match the original.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In this letter, {{we present}} a novel robust method for em-bedding watermarks into {{dithered}} halftone images. The method is named paired sub-image matching ordered dithering (PSMOD), of which the decoder is provided with a priori information of the orig-inal watermark. The method utilizes the bit and sub-subimage in-terleaving preprocesses. The experiments show that the technique is sufficiently robust to guard against the cropping, tampering, and printed-and-scanned degradation processes, in either B/W or <b>color</b> <b>dithered</b> images. This technique is also sufficiently flexible for var-ious levels of embedded capacities. Index Terms—Bit-interleaving, error diffusion, halftone, or-dered dither...|$|R
5000|$|Much display hardware, {{including}} early computer video adapters {{and many}} modern LCDs used in mobile phones and inexpensive digital cameras, shows {{a much smaller}} color range than more advanced displays. One common application of dithering is to more accurately display graphics containing a greater range of colors than the hardware is capable of showing. For example, dithering might be used in order to display a photographic image containing millions of colors on video hardware that is only capable of showing 256 colors at a time. The 256 available colors {{would be used to}} generate a dithered approximation of the original image. Without <b>dithering,</b> the <b>colors</b> in the original image might simply be [...] "rounded off" [...] to the closest available color, resulting in a new image that is a poor representation of the original. Dithering takes advantage of the human eye's tendency to [...] "mix" [...] two colors in close proximity to one another.|$|R
5000|$|Dithering such as this, {{in which}} the computer's display {{hardware}} is the primary limitation on color depth, is commonly employed in software such as web browsers. Since a web browser may be retrieving graphical elements from an external source, {{it may be necessary}} for the browser to perform dithering on images with too many colors for the available display. It was due to problems with <b>dithering</b> that a <b>color</b> palette known as the [...] "web-safe color palette" [...] was identified, for use in choosing colors that would not be dithered on displays with only 256 colors available.|$|R
50|$|A typical desktop {{inkjet printer}} can print just 16 colors (the {{combination}} of dot or no dot from cyan, magenta, yellow and black print heads). Some of these ink combinations are not useful though, {{because when the}} black ink is used it typically obscures {{any of the other}} colors. To reproduce a large range of <b>colors,</b> <b>dithering</b> is used. In densely printed areas, where the color is dark the dithering is often not visible because the dots of ink merge producing a more uniform print. However, a close inspection of the light areas of a print where the dithering has placed dots much further apart reveals the tell-tale dots of dithering.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the signal}} being {{dithered}} is to undergo further processing, {{then it should}} be processed with a triangular-type dither that has an amplitude of two quantisation steps; for example, so that the dither values computed range from, say, −1 to +1, or 0 to 2. This is the [...] "lowest power ideal" [...] dither, in {{that it does not}} introduce noise modulation (which would manifest as a constant noise floor), and completely eliminates the harmonic distortion from quantisation. If a <b>colored</b> <b>dither</b> is used instead at these intermediate processing stages, then frequency content may [...] "bleed" [...] into other frequency ranges that are more noticeable, which could become distractingly audible.|$|R
50|$|The Voodoo2 {{required}} three {{chips and}} a separate VGA graphics card, whereas new competing 3D products, such as the ATI Rage Pro, Nvidia RIVA 128, and Rendition Verite 2200, were single-chip products. Despite some shortcomings, such as the card's <b>dithered</b> 16-bit 3D <b>color</b> rendering and 800x600 resolution limitations, no other manufacturers' products could match the smooth framerates that the Voodoo2 produced. It was a landmark (and expensive) achievement in PC 3D-graphics. Its excellent performance, and the mindshare gained from the original Voodoo Graphics, resulted in its success. Many users even preferred Voodoo2's dedicated purpose, because they were free to use the quality 2D card of their choice as a result. Some 2D/3D combined solutions at the time offered quite sub-par 2D quality and speed.|$|R
40|$|There is an {{approach}} of annotation extraction from printed documents in which annotations are extracted {{by comparing the}} image of an annotated document and its original document image. In one of the previous methods, {{the image of an}} original document is actually printed and scanned in order to reproduce image degradations of the image of the annotated document. However such a method lacks convenience since users have to use the same printer and scanner to obtain images of an annotated document and its original document. In this paper, we propose an improved annotation extraction method in which the image degradations are compensated by image processing. In the proposed method, the difference between original and annotated document images due to image degradations is reduced by not only removal of the degradations in the annotated document images but also reproduction of the degradation in the original document images. The proposed method consists of three steps of processing which are for <b>dithering,</b> for <b>color</b> change, and for local displacement. We also propose an objective evaluation of extracted annotations to compare the experimental results accurately. Experimental results of the proposed method have shown that the recall of extracted annotations was 80. 94 % and the precision was 85. 59 %. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} possible {{extensions of}} error-diffusion <b>dithering</b> algorithms for <b>color</b> devices that give {{a more accurate}} reproduction of colors than previous algorithms. The main difference of the method presented here and others is that usually color channels are regarded separately, whereas we look at them together as one color value {{that is used to}} select the closest output color. This alone results in more accurate color reproduction and less ink consumption. In addition, with the advent of better printing technology,errordiffusion dithering can be used to avoid loss of resolution in favor of more levels of gray or color. Introduction In the last few years computer peripherals that can support color, like ink-jet printers and high quality video boards, have become inexpensive. However, the software drivers used for such units often do not handle them in the best possible way. PostScript, for example, has at least one big disadvantage as far as output on CMYK devices is conce [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Color {{quantization}} {{is sampling}} of three dimensional color spaces (such as RGB or Lab) {{which results in}} a discrete subset of colors known as a color codebook or palette. It is extensively used for display, transfer, and storage of natural images in Internet-based applications, computer graphics, and animation. We propose a sampling scheme which provides a uniform quantization of the Lab space. The idea is based on several results from number theory and phyllotaxy. The sampling algorithm is very much systematic, and allows easy design of universal (image-independent) color codebooks for a given set of parameters. The codebook structure allows fast quantization and ordered <b>dither</b> of <b>color</b> images. The display quality of images quantized by the proposed color codebooks is comparable with that of image-dependent quantizers. Most importantly, the quantized images are more amenable {{to the type of}} processing used for gray-scale ones. Methods for processing gray-scale images cannot be simply extended to color images because they rely on the fact that each gray-level is described by a single number and the fact that a relation of full order can be easily established on the set of those numbers. Color spaces (such as RGB or Lab) are, on the other hand, three-dimensional. The proposed color quantization, i. e., color space sampling and numbering of sampled points, makes methods for processing gray-scale images extendible to color images. We illustrate possible processing of color images by first introducing the basic average and difference operations and then implementing edge detection and compression of color quantized images...|$|R
5000|$|This {{dithered}} {{printing process}} could require {{a region of}} four to six dots (measured across each side) in order to faithfully reproduce the color in a single pixel. An image that is 100 pixels wide {{may need to be}} 400 to 600 dots in width in the printed output; if a 100&times;100-pixel image is to be printed in a one-inch square, the printer must be capable of 400 to 600 dots per inch to reproduce the image. Fittingly, 600 dpi (sometimes 720) is now the typical output resolution of entry-level laser printers and some utility inkjet printers, with 1200/1440 and 2400/2880 being common [...] "high" [...] resolutions. This contrasts with the 300/360 (or 240) dpi of early models, and the approximate 200 dpi of dot-matrix printers and fax machines, which gave faxed and computer-printed documents—especially those that made heavy use of graphics or colored block text—a characteristic [...] "digitized" [...] appearance, because of their coarse, obvious <b>dither</b> patterns, inaccurate <b>colors,</b> loss of clarity in photographs, and jagged ("aliased") edges on some text and line art.|$|R
5000|$|Just {{like the}} bootsplash screens in earlier {{versions}} of Windows, there was a hard but poorly documented limit on how large the compressed file could be, because of the very limited memory available during the boot process (the very reason that RLE {{was used in the}} first place - a plain BMP would have been 125kb and thus entirely too large; the default images are around 10 to 70kb each). If the file was too large, it would either simply fail to display or cause the system to crash, which required the user to reboot and drop into DOS mode before the logo had a chance to load, and either delete it or rename it to prevent the system trying to display it again before it could be fixed or replaced. Staying below, and moreover editing an image to bring it below this limit was an imprecise science that mostly required taking advantage of the particular characteristics of RLE, e.g. ensuring there were sufficient areas of the screen with long horizontal runs of the same color, by reducing the <b>dither</b> quality or <b>color</b> reduction mode, shrinking it slightly and adding a black border a few pixels wide all around, etc. Each run allowed a two byte code to represent a strip many pixels wide, and hence blank spaces or areas of flat color compressed very tightly, whereas regions with no repeated colors at all were at best uncompressed, at worst slightly larger than they would otherwise have been.|$|R
