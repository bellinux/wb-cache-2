500|$|... "Heaven" [...] lyrically {{talks about}} the protagonist saying a final goodbye to a {{deceased}} beloved person. It contains emotional lyrics which offer comfort to the protagonist. The ballad opens with the line [...] "I fought for you the hardest, it made me the strongest, So tell me your secrets — I just can't stand to see you leaving" [...] sang with emotional and touching vocals by the singer. The hook [...] "Heaven couldn't wait for you / No heaven couldn't wait for you / So go on, go home" [...] is continuously repeated. BET'a Latifah Muhammad described Beyoncé's vocal rendition as [...] "heartbreaking yet optimistic". [...] "Heaven" [...] closes with a spoken 20-second snippet outro of the Lord's Prayer (...) recited in Spanish by Melissa Vargas, the singer's brand manager. Many critics noted how the song may {{have been inspired by}} the singer's miscarriage. Clare Lobenfeld from Complex magazine concluded that the song featured Beyoncé's coping mechanisms for the loss of her child, which included using humor to hide pain. According to Spin writer Anupa Mistry, it is in line with one of the themes touched on in the parent album, motherhood. On the album, [...] "Heaven" [...] is placed before [...] "Blue", as the penultimate track. It was noted by critics that both songs were antidotes to each other– while the former discusses notions of death, the latter celebrates birth. Joey Guerra from the Houston Chronicle found the inclusion of those songs as the last on Beyoncé {{as a metaphor for the}} entire album [...] "Darkness always gives way to light, and heartbreak, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>hold</b> on, is always followed by hope".|$|E

2500|$|This {{mechanism}} {{agrees with}} the observations involving return paths: an EMF is generated whenever the disc moves relative to the return path, regardless of {{the rotation of the}} magnet. In fact it was shown that so long as a current loop is used to measure induced EMFs from the motion of the disk and magnet {{it is not possible to}} tell if the magnetic field does or does not rotate with the magnet. (This depends on the definition, the motion of a field can be only defined effectively/relatively. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>hold</b> the view that the field flux is a physical entity, it does rotate or depends on how it is generated. But this does not alter what is used in the Lorentz formula, especially the v, the velocity of the charge carrier relative to the frame where measurement takes place and field strength varies according to relativity at any spacetime point.) ...|$|E
