500|$|When {{introducing}} the composition to Lennon, McCartney {{assured him that}} he would [...] "fix" [...] the line [...] "the movement you need is on your shoulder", reasoning that [...] "it's a stupid expression; it sounds like a parrot." [...] Lennon replied: [...] "You won't, you know. That's the best line in the song." [...] McCartney retained the phrase; he later said of his subsequent live performances of the song: [...] "that's the line when I think of John, and sometimes <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> emotional during that moment." ...|$|E

[...] He then apologizes, saying, [...] "Sorry if <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> Homeric at times. That's genetic, too." [...] This is an allusion to the poet Homer, who was also captivated with the nature versus nurture debate. In fact, Cal himself confesses, [...] "If you were going to devise an experiment to measure the relative influences of nature versus nurture, you couldn't come up with anything better than my life." ...|$|E

I see {{him as one of}} those innocent, childlike monsters of iniquity who are simply unaware of the existence of right and wrong. And he had genius--the real Italian genius for engineering, for dominating and exploiting nature. A true son of the Roman aqueduct builders he was, and a brother of the electrical engineers. Only Kuno--that was his name--didn't work in water; he worked in women. He knew how to harness the natural energy of passion; he made devotion drive his mills. The commercial exploitation of love-power, that was his specialty. I sometimes wonder," [...] Miss Penny added in a different tone, [...] "whether I shall ever be exploited, when <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more middle-aged and celibate, by one of these young engineers of the passions.

Add to all this, visitors interrupting me from 4-5, correspondence, accounts, trustee business, sermons, nursing sick boys, and all the many daily unexpected little troubles that must be smoothed down, and questions inquired into, and boys' conduct investigated, and what becomes of linguistics?

Father lost three steamers in succession by remaining in Paris to argue with me. You know he’s like the schoolmaster in Goldsmith’s Deserted Village—“e’en though vanquished” he always argues still. He and mother went to look at some seventeen families—they had got the addresses somewhere—while I retired to my sofa and would {{have nothing to do with}} it.

6000|$|Especially, {{when one}} {{considers}} the perfunctory way in which {{some of the most}} exalted tasks are already executed by those who are understood to be educated for them, there rises a fearful vision of the human race evolving machinery which will by-and-by throw itself fatally out of work. When, in the Bank of England, I see a wondrously delicate machine for testing sovereigns, a shrewd implacable little steel Rhadamanthus that, once the coins are delivered up to it, lifts and balances each in turn for the fraction of an instant, finds it wanting or sufficient, and dismisses it to right or left with rigorous justice; when I am told of micrometers and thermopiles and tasimeters which deal physically with the invisible, the impalpable, and the unimaginable; of cunning wires and wheels and pointing needles which will register your and my quickness so as to exclude flattering opinion; of a machine for drawing the right conclusion, which will doubtless by-and-by be improved into an automaton for finding true premises; of a microphone which detects the cadence of the fly's foot on the ceiling, and may be expected presently to discriminate the noises of our various follies as they soliloquise or converse in our brains--my mind seeming too small for these things, <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> out of it, like an unfortunate savage too suddenly brought face to face with civilisation, and I exclaim-- ...|$|E
