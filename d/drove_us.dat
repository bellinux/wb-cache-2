500|$|During the {{post-production}} of the film, Bakshi {{found that}} the cost of the optical effect required to complete live-action scenes with animated characters was larger than the film's budget. In order to complete these scenes cost effectively, Bakshi and his camera man Ted C. Bemiller purchased a 35 mm camera to project the footage onto the glass under the animation camera, which was reflected onto where the animation was shot. The same technique was used for the rotoscoped scenes in The Lord of the Rings. According to Bakshi, [...] "The illusion I attempted to create was that of a completely live-action film. Making it work almost <b>drove</b> <b>us</b> crazy." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{production}} concluded on Harlem Nights, Bakshi {{wanted to}} distinguish himself artistically by producing a film in which live action and animated characters would interact. Bakshi said, [...] "The illusion I attempted to create {{was that of}} a completely live-action film. Making it work almost <b>drove</b> <b>us</b> crazy." [...] |page=112 }} Hey Good Lookin' is set in Brooklyn during the 1950s; its lead characters are Vinnie, the leader of a gang named [...] "The Stompers", his friend Crazy Shapiro and their girlfriends, Roz and Eva. Vinnie and Crazy Shapiro were based on Bakshi's high school friends Norman Darrer and Allen Schechterman. |isbn=0-7893-1684-6 }} Warner Bros. optioned the screenplay and greenlit the film in 1973.|$|E
500|$|Hastings {{was born}} on 17 March 1880 in London to Alfred Gardiner Hastings and Kate Comyns Carr, a painter and the sister of J. Comyns Carr. Having been born on Saint Patrick's Day Hastings was named after the saint. His father was a {{solicitor}} with [...] "somewhat seedy clients", and the family were repeatedly bankrupted. Despite financial difficulties, there was enough money in the family to send Hastings to a private preparatory school in 1890 and to Charterhouse School in 1894. Hastings disliked school, saying [...] "I hated the bell which <b>drove</b> <b>us</b> up in the morning, I hated the masters; above all I hated the work, which never interested me in the slightest degree". He was bullied at both the preparatory school and at Charterhouse, and did not excel at either sports or his studies.|$|E
60|$|We were {{separated}} by two men carrying a ladder who <b>drove</b> between <b>us</b> unawares.|$|R
60|$|The {{direction}} in which we <b>drove</b> took <b>us</b> (as well as I could judge) toward the great northern suburb of London.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, {{fears about the}} safety of wooden {{aircraft}} structures <b>drove</b> the <b>US</b> aviation industry to develop all-metal airliners. United Airlines had exclusive right to the all metal twin-engine Boeing 247; rival TWA issued a specification for an all-metal trimotor.|$|R
500|$|Maroon 5 {{began writing}} {{material}} for their third studio album, Hands All Over, {{after completion of}} a world tour that was launched in support of their 2007 studio album It Won't Be Soon Before Long. Months later, the band {{received a phone call}} from Robert John [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange, who had heard that the band were beginning to write a new album, and expressed an interest in producing it. In a press release on their official website, the album is described as [...] "a killer hybrid of rock, pop, funk and R." [...] The band's frontman Adam Levine described Mutt as one of the most successful producers who have ever lived. Jesse Carmichael, the band’s keyboardist, said, [...] "Mutt really helped us play to the best of our ability. And it <b>drove</b> <b>us</b> to be bigger and better than ever." [...] Hands All Over was released on September 21, 2010 in the United States. It received generally favorable reviews from music critics and debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200.|$|E
2500|$|The ship moved {{then into}} the Uruguay river. The pillage of Gualeguaychú was even worse than in Colonia, {{to the point that}} Bustamante wrote to Rivera worried about Garibaldi, fearing that his actions would {{discredit}} the whole operation. Garibaldi described that [...] "The city of Gualeguaychú <b>drove</b> <b>us</b> to conquest by being a real emporium of wealth, capable to dress our ragged soldiers and supply us with harnesses. We acquired many and very good horses in Gualeguaychú, the clothes needed to dress all the people, the harnesses of cavalry and some money distributed among our poor soldiers and sailors, who suffered so much time of misery and privations". Garibaldi's plundering was valued in nearly 30,000 pound sterlings.|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{last the}} three schooners {{grew tired of}} chasing us back and forth. So they went, the three of them, to Nihi, in the northeast. And then they <b>drove</b> <b>us</b> {{steadily}} to the west. Their nine boats were in the water as well. They beat up every island as they moved along. They <b>drove</b> <b>us,</b> <b>drove</b> <b>us,</b> <b>drove</b> <b>us</b> day by day. And every night the three schooners and the nine boats made a chain of watchfulness that stretched across the lagoon from rim to rim, {{so that we could}} not escape back.|$|E
5000|$|Yes, {{the three}} of <b>us</b> <b>drove</b> out to Moon Lake Casino, very drunk and {{laughing}} all the way. Blanche DuBois ...|$|R
60|$|She laughed deliciously, and a snow-squall <b>drove</b> upon <b>us</b> and cut our cheeks, and the Elsinore flung {{over and}} down as if she would never rise again, while we held on and swept through the air in a dizzying arc. Margaret {{released}} a hand, still laughing, and pressed aside my ear-flap.|$|R
5000|$|According to one scholar, Noah Feldman: [...] "The {{vocabulary}} of martyrdom and sacrifice, the formal videotaped preconfession of faith, the technological tinkering to increase deadliness—all are now instantly recognizable to every Muslim." [...] Feldman sees a worrying {{trend in the}} steady expansion of the targets of Istishhad since its debut in 1983 when successful bombing of barracks and embassy buildings <b>drove</b> the <b>U.S.</b> military out of Lebanon.|$|R
60|$|And so we held on, gliding {{with the}} stream. It <b>drove</b> <b>us</b> to this bank, and it <b>drove</b> <b>us</b> to that bank, {{and it turned}} us, and whirled us; but yet it carried us on. Sometimes much too slowly; {{sometimes}} much too fast, but yet it carried us on.|$|E
60|$|It {{was this}} callous act that turned all David's mirth to woe, and <b>drove</b> <b>us</b> weeping to our growler.|$|E
60|$|Thus I romanced to {{my patient}} child, {{snatching}} an inspiration from every mile that <b>drove</b> <b>us</b> {{into the far}} country.|$|E
5000|$|... "At {{the speed}} {{they were going}} {{when they came out}} of the loop, I just thought, [...] "That's the end of that for them fellows,'" [...] said W. G.

It looked like all of them hit at the same time." ...|$|R
60|$|BLOOM: Yes. And Molly was {{laughing}} because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock {{as we passed}} a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, <b>drove</b> past <b>us</b> in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across...|$|R
60|$|We <b>drove</b> with <b>us</b> six {{or seven}} cows for food; but our negroes knew nothing of curing the flesh by salting and drying it till we showed them the way, {{and then they were}} mighty willing to do so as long as we had any salt to do it with, and to carry salt a great way too, after we found we should have no more.|$|R

60|$|And his horse-boys lashed us {{with their}} whips and <b>drove</b> <b>us</b> out into the storm. But {{there was to be}} another meeting, after long years, as you shall see.|$|E
6000|$|... 'The Captain {{was going}} to dine at Bowstead's,' said Fulbert, 'so he <b>drove</b> <b>us</b> in his dog-cart. If the frost holds, we are {{to go out and}} skate on Monday.' ...|$|E
50|$|In 2003, after {{performing}} {{a concert in}} Mexico City, Pruneda boarded a plane and flew to Monterrey, Mexico. He boarded a cab and <b>drove</b> to the <b>US</b> border crossing at Brownsville, Texas where he asked for asylum.|$|R
50|$|Rice's {{professional}} career began in 1996, when he <b>drove</b> in one <b>U.S.</b> F2000 event; he finished eighth after starting second. He also drove in the Dodge Shelby Pro Series, winning from the pole at Las Vegas, Nevada.|$|R
50|$|In October 2011, {{the band}} {{relocated}} to San Francisco. They took one car, one trailer, and their Great Dane and <b>drove</b> across the <b>U.S.</b> They met Aguirre in San Francisco {{and he joined}} the band in February 2012.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was indeed, sir. At {{one time}} they fairly <b>drove</b> <b>us</b> back, but I {{think that we}} should have beaten them even if you had not brought help to us." ...|$|E
60|$|BURGOYNE. They {{add that}} they are sending the man who raised Springtown last night and <b>drove</b> <b>us</b> out; {{so that we may}} know that we are dealing with an officer of importance.|$|E

5000|$|While suicide martyrdom {{did not win}} the Iran-Iraq War for Iran, it did {{spread to}} Lebanon, where it won {{victories}} for the Iraqi Islamic Da'wa party, Shia 'allies' of the Islamic Revolution there. The 1983 bombings against U.S. and French peacekeeping troops by Hizballah killed over 300 and <b>drove</b> the <b>US</b> and French from Lebanon. Another longer bombing campaign did likewise to the Israeli army. Khomeini is credited by some with inspiring these [...] "suicide bombers".|$|R
60|$|And {{then the}} wind came, smack {{out of the}} blackness, with the abruptness of thunder and {{accompanied}} by the most diabolical thunder. And with the rain and thunder came the blackness. It was tangible. It <b>drove</b> past <b>us</b> in the bellowing wind like so much stuff that one could feel. Blackness as well as wind impacted on us. There {{is no other way}} to describe it than by the old, ancient old, way of saying one could not see his hand before his face.|$|R
5000|$|... "We've already solved {{most of the}} {{pollution}} problems in the West.

60|$|Oh! that blessed hailstorm that <b>drove</b> <b>us</b> in! I drew Harold into a seat by the door, keeping {{between him}} and that, {{that he might not}} escape. But I need not have feared.|$|E
60|$|Wednesday, 27th.--Set {{out early}} this morning, and {{travelled}} till noon, {{when the wind}} again <b>drove</b> <b>us</b> ashore, where we remained, in no very happy humour, all day. Mr Bain and I played the flute for pastime.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Joseph Harrison <b>drove</b> <b>us</b> {{down to the}} station, and we {{were soon}} {{whirling}} up in a Portsmouth train. Holmes was sunk in profound thought, and hardly opened his mouth until we had passed Clapham Junction.|$|E
5000|$|The men {{continued}} beating Howard while questioning him. The beating concluded after 10 or 15 {{minutes with}} no resistance from Howard, as he feared {{he would be}} killed. When the Verners stopped, Howard got to his car and <b>drove</b> home. <b>U.S.</b> Attorney John P. Cowart arrested the Verner brothers and charged them with [...] "unlawfully injuring Golden Lamar Howard because of his having testified before a federal grand jury" [...] and [...] "conspiring to injure" [...] him. The Verners' $10,000 bonds were signed by H.L. Peters of Walton County, who put up 316 acre of land as security.|$|R
25|$|In February 2014, Sigma Nu {{suspended}} all chapter {{events at}} University of North Carolina Wilmington after a fight broke {{out at a}} party they hosted. An East Carolina University student attending their party <b>drove</b> with a <b>US</b> Marine on his hood and hit a tree, killing the Marine. He was arrested for DWI and felony death by vehicle.|$|R
60|$|Our {{proceedings}} {{of that first}} morning did little to advance the investigation. It was marked, however, at the outset by an incident which left the most sinister impression upon my mind. The approach to the spot at which the tragedy occurred is down a narrow, winding, country lane. While {{we made our way}} along it we heard the rattle of a carriage coming towards us and stood aside to let it pass. As it <b>drove</b> by <b>us</b> I caught a glimpse through the closed window of a horribly contorted, grinning face glaring out at us. Those staring eyes and gnashing teeth flashed past us like a dreadful vision.|$|R
