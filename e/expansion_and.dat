New damping concept calls for application of suitably timed and shaped thermal-gradient waveforms to generate <b>expansions</b> <b>and</b> contractions counteracting vibrations. Responding to processed signal from accelerometer, thermoelectric heat pumps apply thermal gradients producing <b>expansions</b> <b>and</b> contractions in {{upper and lower}} caps of cantilever beam. These <b>expansions</b> <b>and</b> contractions partly counteract vibrations sensed by accelerometer, thus contributing to damping...|$|R
