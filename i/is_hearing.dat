25|$|The Court {{operates}} in two divisions, where either three or five justices sit {{to hear a}} case before the Court. For especially important cases, the President of the Court may decide that the bench be constituted by seven justices. When a case is heard by five or seven justices, these shall usually be the most senior justices on the Court. The main rule is that cases are presented orally before the Supreme Court, and the court sessions are generally open to the public. The President of the Supreme Court presides over the session or, in his absence, the Vice-President. If neither of them <b>is</b> <b>hearing</b> the case, the most senior justice in session will preside.|$|E

Long ago, one child from each tribe, chosen to bear the curse of Thorn, must sacrifice its next of kin {{on the night of}} Samhain, or Halloween. Tommy believes that Steven will be Michael's final sacrifice. While Tommy goes out to look for Loomis, Mrs. Blankenship reveals to Kara that she was babysitting Michael the night he killed his sister, and that Danny <b>is</b> <b>hearing</b> a voice telling him to kill just like Michael did, indicating Danny also possesses the power of Thorn. Meanwhile, Michael kills John, Tim, Tim's girlfriend Beth, and Barry Simms. After Tommy returns home with Loomis, the Man in Black reveals himself to be Wynn. The cult take Kara, Danny, Steven, and Michael to Smith's Grove. There, Loomis confronts Wynn, who reveals he wants to control and study the power of Thorn. Wynn wants Loomis to join in on his conspiracy, and reveals that Jamie's baby represents a new cycle of Michael's evil that he kept secret from most of the cult who were focused on inflicting the curse onto a new child (Danny) to carry out a new trend of family sacrifices. Loomis calls Wynn out on his scheme and is knocked unconscious.|$|E

500|$|Just before Roy Anderson (David Denman) {{talks to}} the captain, Michael asks Jim who he would save on a sinking ship. Jim covers up in saying that he would save the customer, but makes it clear {{afterwards}} that he would save the receptionist. He approaches Pam to perhaps tell her his feelings {{at the same time}} that Roy <b>is</b> <b>hearing</b> a war story from the captain. A drunken Roy is inspired to announce a date for his wedding with Pam, just before Jim can reach her. Jim is crushed and breaks up with Katy, realizing that he does not want to be with her. He confesses to Michael his feelings for Pam, which surprises Michael, who claims he has a [...] "radar for stuff like that". As Jim is seemingly ready to give up on Pam, Michael, in an uncharacteristically serious moment, encourages him to pursue her. Afterwards, Michael finally informs Dwight the wheel he has been steering is not real.|$|E

Except for {{using some of the}} songs and characters, the story is unrelated to the Rodgers and Hammerstein version. [...] Geared towards children, the adaptation includes cuddly animals, including a dragon. [...] Voices were provided by Miranda Richardson as Anna (speaking), Christiane Noll as Anna (singing), Martin Vidnovic as the King, Ian Richardson as the Kralahome and Adam Wylie as Louis. [...] Hischak dislikes the film but praises the vocals, adding that one compensation of the film <b>is</b> <b>hearing</b> Barbra Streisand sing a medley of [...] "I Have Dreamed", [...] "We Kiss in a Shadow" [...] and [...] "Something Wonderful", which is borrowed from Streisand's 1985 The Broadway Album and played under the film's closing credits.

2500|$|The {{term for}} the first time was used at the time of Muhammad. At present, the word refers to the Muslims who believe that the {{leadership}} of the community after Muhammad belongs to Ali and his successors. Nawbakhti states that the term Shia refers to a group of Muslims {{that at the time of}} Muhammad and after him regarded Ali as the Imam and Caliph. Al-Shahrastani expresses that the term Shia refers to those who believe that Ali is designated as the Heir, Imam and caliph by Muhammad and also Ali's authority never goes out of his descendants. For the Shia, this conviction is implicit in the Quran and history of Islam. Shia scholars emphasize that the notion of authority is linked to the family of the prophets as the verses 3:33,34 shows: [...] "Indeed, Allah chose Adam and Noah and the family of Abraham and the family of 'Imran over the worlds - (33) Descendants, some of them from others. And Allah <b>is</b> <b>Hearing</b> and Knowing. (34)" [...] Shia search for the true meaning of the revelation to get the purpose of the life blood and the human destiny.|$|E

2500|$|Entity FX {{also had}} to create the first {{instance}} of Clark’s super hearing, an ability he acquires in the episode [...] "Whisper". As Beck describes the task: [...] "When you talk about someone flying, it’s something we all know, but this is super hearing {{and we need to}} see a visual for the hearing." [...] For the effect of showing Clark using his super hearing, Mat Beck and Entity FX decided that they wanted to travel into Clark’s ear and see all the different parts of his eardrum working together to create the sound he <b>is</b> <b>hearing.</b> The task proved difficult to achieve, and Beck asserts that changes will be made to perfect the look of Clark using his super hearing. Clark’s super hearing was originally to be revealed early in the season, but when The WB informed the Smallville team that Tarzan, the main character in the studio’s update of the classic legend, also had super hearing the team decided to delay the introduction so that the ability could be used in a manner that surpassed what was shown on Tarzan. Luckily for Smallville, The WB’s Tarzan was canceled before [...] "Whisper" [...] aired, allowing Smallville to be the only show on the network with a character who has superhuman hearing.|$|E
2500|$|Looking at the {{language}} of the play in a more general sense has also produced a range of critical theories. For example, Jacques Berthoud argues that the rhetoric of the play is explicitly bound up with its theme; [...] "the entire dramatic script, soliloquies included, functions as a network of responses and reactions. [...] primary and consistent function is interlocutory." [...] An entirely different interpretation is that of Jack Reese, who argues that Shakespeare's use of language functions to remove the audience from the effects and implications of violence; it has an almost Brechtian verfremdungseffekt. Using the example of Marcus' speech, Reese argues that the audience is disconnected from the violence through the seemingly incongruent descriptions of that violence. Such language serves to [...] "further emphasise the artificiality of the play; in a sense, they suggest to the audience that it <b>is</b> <b>hearing</b> a poem read rather than seeing the events of that poem put into dramatic form." [...] Gillian Kendall, however, reaches the opposite conclusion, arguing that rhetorical devices such as metaphor augment the violent imagery, not diminish it, because the figurative use of certain words complements their literal counterparts. This, however, [...] "disrupts the way the audience perceives imagery." [...] An example of this is seen in the body politic/dead body imagery early in the play, as the two images soon become interchangeable. Another theory is provided by Peter M. Sacks, who argues that {{the language}} of the play is marked by [...] "an artificial and heavily emblematic style, and above all a revoltingly grotesque series of horrors which seem to have little function but to ironise man's inadequate expressions of pain and loss".|$|E
