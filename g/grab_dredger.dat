50|$|INS Khadan is a <b>grab</b> <b>dredger</b> {{built by}} Goa Shipyard Limited (then {{a part of}} Mazagon Dock Limited) for the Indian Navy. It was {{commissioned}} on 30 April 1975. Its yard number is 1055.|$|E

50|$|A {{bucket dredger}} is {{equipped}} with a bucket dredge, which is a device that picks up sediment by mechanical means, often with many circulating buckets attached to a wheel or chain. Some bucket <b>dredgers</b> and <b>grab</b> <b>dredgers</b> are powerful enough to rip out coral to make a shipping channel through coral reefs.|$|R
50|$|The deepest {{section of}} the Fehmarn Belt Trench is 35 metres and the tunnel {{sections}} will be about 10 metres high, thus the dredging barges {{will need to be}} capable of reaching depths of over 45 metres. Dredging will produce a trench some 40-50 m wide and 12-15 m deep. These parameters give a total of some 20 million cubic metres of soils to be dredged. Conventional dredging equipment can only reach to a depth of about 25 m. To excavate the middle portion of the Fehmarn trench - deeper than 25 m below the water's surface - will likely require <b>grab</b> <b>dredgers</b> and trailing suction hopper dredgers.|$|R
50|$|A <b>grab</b> <b>dredger</b> {{picks up}} seabed {{material}} with a clam shell bucket, which hangs from an onboard crane or a crane barge, or is carried by a hydraulic arm, or is mounted like on a dragline. This technique {{is often used}} in excavation of bay mud. Most of these dredges are crane barges with spuds.|$|E
50|$|The River Tees {{entrance}} created between South Gare, and the North Gare to {{the west}} is 2400 ft wide.The water depth {{at the mouth of}} the Tees at low tide has altered over the years.In 1863 it was 3 ft 6 inches but today stands at 50 ft.Two suction dredgers and occasionally a <b>grab</b> <b>dredger</b> are used to keep the shipping channel clear.|$|E

Transferred to N.E.R in 1922 and renamed [...] "N.E.R Grab No. 4" [...] {{and to the}} L.N.E.R. in 1923. Renamed [...] "H. & B.R. Dredger No. 4" [...] in 1938 and {{ownership}} changed again in 1948 to the Docks and Inland Waterways Executive and then to B.T. Docks Board. Eventually sold to Italian interests and broken up in 1963.|$|E
5000|$|... 8 {{cubic meter}} class dredger in PLAN service was {{originally}} designated {{by a combination}} of two Chinese characters followed by three-digit number. The first Chinese character is Jiao (交), short for Jiao-Tong (交通, meaning traffic in Chinese). The second Chinese character is Zhua (抓), short for Zhua-Dou-Shi (抓斗, meaning grab in Chinese, because the ship is a <b>grab</b> <b>dredger).</b> However, the pennant numbers may have changed due to the change of Chinese naval ships naming convention.|$|E
5000|$|... 8 {{cubic meter}} class dredger is {{a class of}} naval {{auxiliary}} ship currently in service with the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN). The complete name of the class is 8 cubic meter <b>grab</b> <b>dredger,</b> and {{it can also be}} used as a crane ship, capable of lifting a maximum of a hundred ton for each single lift. In 1984, PLAN Equipment and Technology department signed a contract with East Sea Shipyard to build 8 cubic meter class dredger / crane ship designed to meet requirements of Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (ClassNK). The general designers were Mr. Xun Zhi-Liang (荀志亮) and Mr. Zhang Lin-Sheng (张林生). Construction began in December 1984, and after completion, the ship sailed to Qingdao in June 1985 for further sea trials, which were completed successfully. The following month, the ship was handed over to PLAN.|$|E

40|$|Key words: sensor; drift angle; safety {{monitoring}} Abstract: Depending on {{instruments and}} operator’s experiences, {{the operation of}} steel cable <b>grab</b> <b>dredger</b> is influenced by construction environment, weather conditions, monitoring accuracy and human factors. Misjudgment may be made, which will cause safety problems. To achieve data safety monitoring, this paper converted the traditional artificial judgment on potential safety risks caused by crab bucket’s drift into a computational process...|$|E
40|$|The World Organisation of Dredging Associations (WODA) has {{identified}} underwater sound {{as an environmental}} issue that needs further consideration. A WODA Expert Group on Underwater Sound (WEGUS) was established to provide a guidance paper on dredging sound, impact on aquatic biota and advice on underwater sound monitoring procedures. The paper recommends following a risk based process as this {{would result in a}} more systematic approach to sound impact studies. A critical need is standardization of acoustic terminology and methods and the paper provides suggestions. It is further noted that underwater acoustic models, in combination with measurements provide a pragmatic approach for the assessment of sound distribution. Dredging sounds can be associated with dredging excavation, dredging vessels during transport, and dredged material placement. One or more of four types of dredgers are used: Cutter Suction Dredger, Trailing Suction Hopper Dredger, <b>Grab</b> <b>Dredger,</b> and Backhoe Dredger. Existing data indicate that source levels associated with most dredging processes are generally comparable with those of merchant ships, with the exception of elevated levels of noise generated by gravel extraction. Some cetaceans have been observed avoiding areas of dredging activity on a temporal basis. No information exists about effects of dredging-induced sound on seals or fish. While it is clear that dredging sound has the potential to affect the behavior of aquatic life in some cases, there appears to be minimal risk of injury. Yet, information on impacts are necessary to further identify risks and support informed decisions about the necessity of sound mitigation measures...|$|E
