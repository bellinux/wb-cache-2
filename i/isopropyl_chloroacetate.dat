40|$|<b>Isopropyl</b> <b>chloroacetate</b> {{has been}} {{synthesized}} by esterification of chloroacetic acid and isopropanol, using lanthanum dodecyl sulfate (LDDS) as the catalyst. Various factors that affected the esterification have been investigated, such as reaction time, different water-carrying agent {{and the amount}} of catalyst. Under the condition of 1. 2 / 1 molar ratio of isopropanol to chloroacetic acid, 1. 0 % catalyst (molar percent of chloroacetic acid), 2. 5 h reaction time, 5 mL cyclohexane as water-carrying agent and reflux temperature, the esterification conversion of <b>isopropyl</b> <b>chloroacetate</b> reaches 98. 3 %. The catalytic activity of LDDS is almost equal to that of a BrÃ˜nsted acid. LDDS, as one kind of water-tolerant Lewis acid, is an excellent catalyst compared to the traditional Lewis acid...|$|E
