40|$|Past {{research}} on temporal self-appraisal theory {{has revealed that}} individuals are able to maintain a positive sense of self by subjectively moving favourable past events forward and unfavourable past events backward in time. The current study extends past work by examining whether individuals alter subjective distance from historical <b>injustices</b> to protect their collective identity. Men, {{as members of a}} perpetrator group, may perceive past <b>injustices</b> against women as a threat to their collective identity. As such, men may be motivated to subjectively move past <b>injustices</b> backward in time. On the other hand, women, as members of a victim group, may perceive past <b>injustices</b> against women as a crucial aspect of their collective identity. As such, women may be motivated to subjectively move past <b>injustices</b> forward in time. Study 1 examined subjective distance from past <b>injustices</b> and its relation to collective guilt and support for compensation. When the threat posed by past <b>injustices</b> had not been mitigated by the 2 ̆ 2 advances made in women 2 ̆ 7 s rights 2 ̆ 2, men distanced past <b>injustices</b> more than women. Furthermore, men who distanced <b>injustices</b> furthest in the past reported less collective guilt and less support for compensation; whereas women who perceived <b>injustices</b> to be closer to the present reported greater support for compensation. Study 2 examined the causal role of subjective distance in determining collective guilt and support for compensation. Further support was provided for the role of subjective distance in men 2 ̆ 7 s acceptance of collective guilt and willingness to compensate women. However, results suggest that subjective distance may not have played as large a role for women 2 ̆ 7 s assignment of collective blame. We discuss the powerful role of time perception in forging, or severing, connections between history and current experience...|$|R
40|$|Slavery in Ancient Greece, Absolutist Monarchy in pre-modern Europe, and the European {{conquest of}} the New World strike us, from our {{contemporary}} perspective, as <b>injustices</b> on a massive scale. But given {{the impact of these}} large-scale historical activities on the particular course taken by Western history, they almost undeniably {{played an important role in}} the evolution of modern liberalism. Bernard Williams suggests a startling claim—that liberal universalists cannot condemn past <b>injustices,</b> because those <b>injustices</b> were necessary conditions of the development of the modern liberalism that they affirm. This paper examines this possible objection to liberal universalists who greatly value their liberal way of life, paying particular attention to the lamentable necessities thesis, the claim that modern liberalism would not have come into existence but for the occurrence of past <b>injustices.</b> It defends the lamentable necessities thesis, and argues that those who accept it, and greatly value modern liberalism, are precluded from regretting all-things-considered certain past <b>injustices.</b> Finally, it makes the case that liberal universalists who greatly value modern liberalism may condemn past <b>injustices</b> necessary to its emergence, even if they are unable to regret them in the relevant sens...|$|R

5|$|The Joker {{possesses}} no superhuman abilities, instead {{using his}} expertise in chemical engineering to develop poisonous or lethal concoctions, and thematic weaponry, including razor-tipped playing cards, deadly joy buzzers, and acid-spraying lapel flowers. The Joker sometimes works with other Gotham City supervillains {{such as the}} Penguin and Two-Face, and groups like the <b>Injustice</b> Gang and <b>Injustice</b> League, but these relationships often collapse due to the Joker's desire for unbridled chaos. The 1990s introduced a romantic interest for the Joker in his former psychiatrist, Harley Quinn, who becomes his villainous sidekick. Although his primary obsession is Batman, the Joker has also fought other heroes including Superman and Wonder Woman.|$|E

40|$|About the book: The book {{demonstrates}} how awareness of environmental hazards, <b>injustices</b> and {{new forms of}} risk is only effective when it generates strategies for political change. It examines how environmental movements have become increasingly involved in governance processes at the national, regional and intergovernmental levels, in contexts such as the EU, UN and LA 21 initiatives. The authors argue that while 'rights-discourse' has highlighted the status of specific identities, taking account of obligation prompts a consideration of social, cultural, political, economic and environmental <b>injustices.</b> Tackling these <b>injustices</b> demands a concern with both entitlements and obligations of all relevant parties and constituencies...|$|R
