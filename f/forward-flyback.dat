40|$|Due to the flybacks' {{indirect}} {{characteristic of}} energy transfer, the transformer size increases for high power levels. Providing an additional direct energy transfer path can decrease its size. Parallel <b>forward-flyback</b> converters offer such functionality and outperform forward converters {{with regard to}} PFC functionality. A balanced <b>forward-flyback</b> converter is a variation {{on this kind of}} parallel converter. The forward and flyback sub-converters share a transformer winding and an additional balancing capacitor enables even better AC line voltage utilization. This paper starts with an in-depth analysis of the balanced <b>forward-flyback</b> converter, and introduces ten operating modes in which this converter can operate. A boundary-conduction mode (BCM) controller for the magnetization current is developed and presented, and through simulations the PFC performance of the converter is tested with a constant switch on-time controller. Moreover, a prototype is designed and built with both a dissipative R-C-D snubber and two-switch clamp configuration. Experimental results from the 100 W/ 120 – 373 V AC/DC prototype were obtained to prove the converter operation and BCM controller concept. The balanced <b>forward-flyback</b> converter in BCM offers good PFC performance and manages a THD of input current between 1. 69 % and 4. 38 %...|$|E

40|$|International audienceNormally-on Silicon Carbide (SiC) JFETs are {{considered}} promising switching semiconductor devices for solid state DC breaker {{due to their}} small on-resistance and robustness with short-circuit. In the self-power DC solid-state circuit breaker using normally-on SiC JFET, a very fast and reliable protection driver is required to generate a sufficient negative voltage to turn and hold off the SiC JFET. This paper proposes a <b>forward-flyback</b> converter topology for the protection driver. The converter will be activated whenever circuit breaker detects short-circuit faults by sensing the drain-source voltage of JFET and create a negative voltage applies to the gate of JFET. To avoid gate failure by over voltage at the gate of JFET, the output voltage of the <b>forward-flyback</b> converter is regulated using Primary Side Sensing technique. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed protection driver can provide sufficient negative output voltage to turn off JFET and maintain this voltage in the permitted range...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Global energy {{consumption}} tends to grow continuously. To satisfy {{the demand for}} electric power {{against a background of}} the depletion of conventional, fossil resources the renewable energy sources are becoming more popular. According to the researches despite its fluctuating nature and weather dependency the capacity of renewable resources can satisfy overall global demand for energy. High gain DC/DC converters are the key part of renewable energy systems. The designing of high gain DC/DC converters is imposed by severe demands. The power conditioning systems for the photovoltaic power sources needs high step-up voltage gain due to the low output of the generating sources. This paper presents a high step-up topology employing a Series-connected <b>Forward-FlyBack</b> converter, which has a series-connected output for high boosting voltage-transfer gain. Series-connected <b>Forward-FlyBack</b> converter is a hybrid type of forward and flyback converter. By stacking the outputs of them extremely high voltage gain can be obtained with small volume and high efficiency with a galvanic isolation. The separated secondary windings reduce the voltage stress of the secondary rectifiers and results in high efficiency.

30|$|Isolated {{bidirectional}} DC-DC converters with high-frequency transformer, {{such as the}} Flyback-based [6, 7], <b>Forward-Flyback</b> based [8], boost integrated Flyback rectifier/energy (BIFRED) based [9], dual half-bridge based [10, 11], {{dual active}} bridge (DAB) based converters [12, 13, 14, 15] and their counterparts [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22], can easily achieve high step-up/step-down conversion because the turns ratio of the transformer provides another control freedom for the voltage regulation. However, the conduction losses and transformer losses are a little high because the whole delivered energy will flow through the power switches and windings of primary and secondary sides.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an interleaved active-clamping zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) <b>forward-flyback</b> converter without an output choke. The presented topology has two active-clamping circuits with two separated transformers. Because of the interleaved {{operation of the}} converter, the output current ripple will be reduced. The proposed converter can approximately share the total load current between the two secondaries. Therefore, the transformer copper loss and the rectifier diodes conduction loss can be decreased. The output capacitor is made of two series capacitors which reduces the peak reverse voltage of the rectifier diodes. The circuit has no output inductor and few semiconductor elements, such that the adopted circuit has a simpler structure, a lower cost and is suitable for high power density applications. A detailed analysis and the design of this new converter are described. A prototype converter has been implemented and experimental results have been recorded with an ac input voltage of 85 - 135 Vrms, an output voltage of 12 V and an output current of 16 A...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe use of {{normally}} on Silicon Carbide (SiC) JFET devices {{poses the}} question of safety and reliability in Voltage Fed Inverter (VFI) applications. Indeed, when a JFET is not driven with a sufficient negative voltage, the JFET is conducting and the VFI may be short-circuited. Therefore, it is needed to generate a negative voltage to turn-off the JFET to protect the VFI in case of gate driver failure. The settling time of this negative voltage must be inferior to the power system constant time to reduce the rise time of the short-circuit current. In this paper, a solution to protect the JFET and the system is proposed. A circuit description of an innovative topology using a <b>Forward-Flyback</b> topology with Primary Side Sensing (PSS) technique and an Output Voltage Estimation based on the Time Constant Matching (OVETCM) is presented. Moreover, the converter protects the VFI for an input range from 3 V to 610 V and up to 150 °C. Experimental results are provided and validate {{the design of the}} safety system...|$|E
