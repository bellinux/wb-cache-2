By introducing the link frustration, the evolutionary process is implemented by rewiring the links with probability proportional to their frustration, {{until the final}} network displaying a unique non-frustrated dynamical state is reached. Resulting networks are bipartite and with zero clustering. In addition, the designed non-frustrated anti-phase <b>synchronised</b> <b>networks</b> display a clear topological scale.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) produces long-lasting alterations in synaptic efficacy. We now demonstrate that activation of mGluRs can also induce long-term alterations in <b>synchronised</b> <b>network</b> activity that are both induced and expressed {{in the absence of}} chemical synaptic transmission. Specifically, in hippocampal slices in which synaptic transmission was eliminated by perfusing with a Ca 2 +-free medium, the selective group I mGluR agonist 3, 5 -dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) induced a persistent (> 3 h) enhancement (> 2 -fold) of the frequency of synchronised bursting activity. The underlying biochemical mechanism responsible for the induction of this form of plasticity was similar to that for DHPG-induced long-term depression (LTD) in that it required the activation of tyrosine phosphatases. Also, like DHPG-induced LTD, this form of neuronal plasticity could be reversed by application of the mGluR antagonist α-methyl- 4 -carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG). This unusual form of plasticity, which presumably also occurs when synaptic transmission is intact, could contribute to long-term alterations in synchronised activity in hippocampal neuronal networks. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, such studies often ignore dendritic morphology and focus only on somato-somatic gap junctions. In the case of dendro-dendritic coupling, simulations of multi-compartmental models reveal that network dynamics can be tuned by {{the location of the}} gap junction on the dendritic tree [13, 14]. Here, we develop a more mathematical approach using the continuum cable description of a dendritic tree (either passive or resonant) that can compactly represent the response of an entire dendro-dendritic gap junction coupled neural network to injected current using a response function. This response function, often referred as a Green’s function, describes the voltage dynamics along a network structure in response to a delta-Dirac pulse applied at a given discrete location. Our work is based on the method for constructing the Green’s function of a single branched passive dendritic tree as originally proposed by Abbott et al. [15, 16] and generalised by Coombes et al.

40|$|P 19 is a mouse-derived {{embryonal}} carcinoma cell line capable of differentiation toward ectodermal, mesodermal and endodermal lineages and could thus be differentiated into neurons. Different culture conditions were tested to optimise {{and increase the}} efficiency of neuronal differentiation since the population of P 19 -derived neurons {{was reported to be}} heterogeneous with respect to the morphology and neurotransmitters they synthesise. P 19 -derived neurons were cultured on microelectrode arrays as cell aggregates and as dissociated cells. Improved neuronal maturation was shown by the presence of microtubule associated protein 2, neurofilament and synaptophysin formation when initiation of neuronal differentiation was prolonged. High initial cell density cultures and coating of surfaces with polyethylenimine-laminin further improved neuronal maturation of differentiated P 19 cells. Increased spontaneous activities of the P 19 -derived neurons were correspondingly recorded. Two to three hours recordings were performed between 17 and 25 days when extracellular signals were stabilised.

40|$|Astrocytes spontaneously release {{glutamate}} as a gliotransmitter (GT) {{resulting in}} the generation of extrasynaptic NMDA-R mediated slow inward currents (SICs) in neighbouring neurons, which can increase local neuronal excitability. However, there is a deficit in {{our knowledge of the}} factors that control spontaneous astrocyte GT release, and the extent of its influence. We found that in rat brain slices, increasing the supply of the physiological transmitter glutamate increased the frequency and signalling charge of SICs over an extended period. This phenomenon was replicated by exogenous pre-exposure to the amino acid D-Aspartate. Using D-Aspartate as a “False” GT we determined the extent of local neuron excitation by GT release in VB thalamus, CA 1 hippocampus and somatosensory cortex. By analysing synchronised neuronal NMDA-R mediated excitation we found that the properties of the excitation were conserved in different brain areas. In the three areas, astrocyte derived GT release synchronised groups of neurons at distances of over 200 μm. Individual neurons participated in more than one synchronised population, indicating that individual neurons can be excited by more than one astrocyte, and that individual astrocytes may determine a neuron's <b>synchronised</b> <b>network.</b> The results confirm that astrocytes can act as excitatory nodes that can influence neurons over a significant range in a number of brain regions. Our findings further suggest that chronic elevation of ambient glutamate levels can lead to increased gliotransmitter glutamate release, which may be relevant in some pathological states...|$|R

In its journey to its current form, the Internet has evolved from a network research project initiated by US researchers at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to a global network of interconnected computers. Many services which {{we take for granted}} today, such as e-mail and the World Wide Web (WWW), rely on the underlying Internet networking technologies to provide the pervasive Internet services modern society has come to expect. The objective of this thesis is to investigate the development of mathematical models suitable for the analysis and design of TCP congestion control. While there are a multitude of protocols in use in the Internet, the most prevalent is the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). We review current models for TCP congestion control and compare the NS packet level model (the de-facto standard for simulation studies) against real TCP implementations on a testbed network. A recently proposed simplified hybrid model with drop-tail queuing is assessed against NS and a number of modifications studied. Based on the insights gained, a simplified mathematical model of TCP congestion avoidance dynamics in <b>synchronised</b> <b>networks</b> is validated. i Dedication To the memory of my father Sean kilduff. ii Acknowledgements This thesis is the culmination of a body of work performed while working with a research group in the Hamilton Institute.

40|$|The thesis {{introduces}} receiver algorithms {{improving the}} performance of TDMA mobile radio systems. Particularly, we consider receivers utilising side information, which {{can be obtained from}} the error control coding or by having a priori knowledge of interference sources. Iterative methods can be applied in the former case and interference suppression techniques in the latter. Convolutional coding adds redundant information into the signal and thereby protects messages transmitted over a radio channel. In the coded systems the receiver is usually comprised of separate channel estimation, detection and channel decoding tasks due to complexity restrictions. This suboptimal solution suffers from performance degradation compared to the optimal solution achieved by optimising the joint probability of information bits, transmitted symbols and channel impulse response. Conventional receiver utilises estimated channel state information in the detection and detected symbols in the channel decoding to finally obtain information bits. However, the channel decoder provides also extrinsic information on the bit probabilities, which is independent of the received information at the equaliser input. Therefore it is beneficial to re-perform channel estimation and detection using this new extrinsic information together with the original input signal. We apply iterative receiver techniques mainly to Enhanced General Packet Radio System (EGPRS) using GMSK modulation for iterative channel estimation and 8 -PSK modulation for iterative detection scheme. Typical gain for iterative detection is around 2  dB and for iterative channel estimation around 1  dB. Furthermore, we suggest two iteration rounds as a reasonable complexity/performance trade-off. To obtain further complexity reduction we introduce the soft trellis decoding technique that reduces the decoder complexity significantly in the iterative schemes. Cochannel interference (CCI) originates from the nearby cells that are reusing the same transmission frequency. In this thesis we consider CCI suppression by joint detection (JD) technique, which detects simultaneously desired and interfering signals. Because of the complexity limitations we only consider JD for two binary modulated signals. Therefore it is important to find the dominant interfering signal (DI) to achieve the best performance. In the presence of one strong DI, the JD provides major improvement in the receiver performance. The JD requires joint channel estimation (JCE) for the two signals. However, the JCE makes the implementation of the JD more difficult, since it requires <b>synchronised</b> <b>network</b> and unique training sequences with low cross-correlation for the two signals. reviewe...|$|R

40|$|A key {{aspect of}} nervous system development, {{including}} that of the cerebral cortex, is the formation of higher-order neural networks. Developing neural networks undergo several phases with distinct activity patterns in vivo, which are thought to prune and fine-tune network connectivity. We report here that human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) -derived cerebral cortex neurons form large-scale networks that reflect {{those found in the}} developing cerebral cortex in vivo. <b>Synchronised</b> oscillatory <b>networks</b> develop in a highly stereotyped pattern over several weeks in culture. An initial phase of increasing frequency of oscillations is followed by a phase of decreasing frequency, before giving rise to non-synchronous, ordered activity patterns. hPSC-derived cortical neural networks are excitatory, driven by activation of AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamate receptors, and can undergo NMDA-receptor-mediated plasticity. Investigating single neuron connectivity within PSC-derived cultures, using rabies-based trans-synaptic tracing, we found two broad classes of neuronal connectivity: most neurons have small numbers (40). These data demonstrate that the formation of hPSC-derived cortical networks mimics in vivo cortical network development and function, demonstrating the utility of in vitro systems for mechanistic studies of human forebrain neural network biology.

40|$|Complex {{networks}} are studied across many fields of science. Much {{progress has been}} made on static and statistical features of networks, such as small world and scale-free networks. However, general studies of network dynamics are comparatively rare. Synchrony is one commonly observed dynamical behaviour in complex networks. Synchrony breaking is where a fully <b>synchronised</b> <b>network</b> loses coherence, and breaks up into multiple clusters of self-synchronised sub-networks. Mathematically this can be described as a bifurcation from a fully synchronous state, and in this thesis we investigate the effect of network topology on synchrony-breaking bifurcations. Coupled cell networks represent a collection of individual dynamical systems (termed cells) that interact with each other. Each cell is described by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) or a system of ODEs. Schematically, the architecture of a coupled cell network can be represented by a directed graph with a node for each cell, and edges indicating cell couplings. Regular homogeneous {{networks are}} a special case where all the nodes/cells and edges are of the same type, and every node has the same number of input edges, which we call the valency of the network. Classes of homogeneous regular networks can be counted using an existing group theoretic enumeration formula, and this formula is extended here to enumerate networks with more generalised structures. However, this does not generate the networks themselves. We therefore develop a computer algorithm to display all connected regular homogeneous networks with less than six cells and analysed synchrony-breaking bifurcations for four-cell regular homogeneous networks. Robust patterns of synchrony (invariant synchronised subspaces under all admissible vector fields) describe how cells are divided into multiple synchronised clusters, and their existence is solely determined by the network topology. These robust patterns of synchrony have a hierarchical relationship, and can be treated as a partially ordered set, and expressed as a lattice. For each robust pattern of synchrony (or lattice point) we can reduce the original network to a smaller network, called a quotient network, by representing each cluster as a single combined node. Therefore, the lattice for a given regular homogeneous network provides robust patterns of synchrony and corresponding quotient networks. Some lattice structures allow a synchrony breaking bifurcation analysis based solely on the dynamics of the quotient networks, which are lifted to the original network using the robust patterns of synchrony. However, in other cases the lattice structure also tells us of the existence and location of additional synchrony-breaking bifurcating branches not seen in the quotient networks. In conclusion the work undertaken here shows that the invariant synchronised subspaces that arise from a network topology facilitate the classification of synchrony-breaking bifurcations of networks.

40|$|Pulse code {{modulation}} {{is being}} introduced into telephone networks {{to increase the}} capacity of existing multi-pair cables. It is possible to use a switched digital communications network for data {{as well as for}} p. c. m. telephone traffic if all the clock oscillators in the network operate in phase at all times. Various control systems have been proposed to achieve the required clock synchronisation without the use of a central reference. These control systems are based on the application of phase locking to a large number of interconnected oscillators. Some proposals are for non-linear systems, but this Thesis is largely restricted to the discussion of linear systems. Two main types of linear system have been proposed. The first, known as the single-ended system, minimises the amount of buffer storage needed at the inputs to the exchanges. These stores allow for the variation of line delay with temperature, as well as accommodating small phase errors. The resulting network operating frequency is substantially dependent on the line delays. The alternative is the double-ended system. This eliminates the interdependence of frequency and line delay, but involves a rather more complicated stability condition. Filters, which are {{an essential part of the}} system hardware, affect the stability of both systems. Their effects are examined in the Thesis. The system equations derived in this Thesis include the line delays, the effects of hnnped filters and the starting conditions. They are obtained for both the single-and double-ended systems. A continuous model is assumed, but the systems are in fact sampled at a high rate c·. 'An alternative 'set of equations has been derived to allow the 'effects of the sampling rate to be investigated. The behaviour of the systems is examined' by means of the mathematics of multivariable control systems. This has allowed many important results to be deduced without exact knowledge of the connections between the exchanges, or even the number of exchanges. The stability criteria in this Thesis are all sufficient, but, not generally necessary. As a result, it has been possible to give the criteria in forms which may be checked at each exchange independently of the rest of the network. It is possible to add to the network without disturbing remote exchanges. The criteria are given in terms of the basic system parameters, such as gains and filter time constants. This Thesis includes a full treatment of the double-ended system, including some of the effects Q£ unbalanced gains in the error paths. The results are more comprehensive than any others published to date. and include the effects of sampling on both classes of system. The factors determining the final frequency of the <b>synchronised</b> <b>network</b> are examined. The double-ended system is treated in a general manner, which yields a formula for unbalanced systems as well as the more usual balanced system. An extreme case of this is the single-ended system. This general formula is expressed in terms of the basic system parameters, which are easily measured. It is shown that the frequency depends upon the variations of the line delays from integer multiples of one frame period, and not their absolute values. The phase comparators used in the locked oscillators are by nature periodic; a piecewise-linear form is considered to be most suitable. The periodicity causes a number of stable states to exist with different phase differences. Some of these differences may cause the buffer store capacities to be insufficient. A new set of system equations, in terms of principle phase differences, is evolved. This leads to a phase-space representation of the system state, Which has links with the method used to examine transient behaviour. Although it is not possible to give a general method for finding all the possible modes for a given network, a necessary condition for a 'wrong mode', with some large phase differences, can be found. This has suggested a technique tor the detection of such modes and their release to the desired mode with substantially zero phase dlfferences. The investigation of transients and the effects of noise is not complete. There is as yet no quantitative analysis of the noise spectrum at the lower frequencies which will affect the control system, Some indlcations of the crltical frequencies are given, to allow such measurements to be made. The investigation of transients shows that in most networks some phase differences will be increased before the network relaxes. Liapunov estimate isused, but this is limited to systems without filters or line delays. The results reported in this Thesis allow the system designer to determine the values of the controllable parameters, Some recommendations are given, and suggestions are made for the design of equipment to automatically set the network in the requlred mode of synchronised operation. A field trial of these systems is required, and proposals being studied by the British Post Office are based on results given in this Thesis. Such a trial should take place over lines carrying signals of the same statistical form as live telephone traffic. This will allow the deduction of further results concerning the transient response of the systems...|$|R
40|$|Recently a new {{recipe for}} {{developing}} and deploying real-time systems {{has become increasingly}} adopted in the JET tokamak. Powered by the advent of x 86 multi-core technology and {{the reliability of the}} JET’s well established Real-Time Data Network (RTDN) to handle all real-time I/O, an official Linux vanilla kernel has been demonstrated to be able to provide realtime performance to user-space applications that are required to meet stringent timing constraints. In particular, a careful rearrangement of the Interrupt ReQuests’ (IRQs) affinities together with the kernel’s CPU isolation mechanism allows to obtain either soft or hard real-time behavior depending on the synchronization mechanism adopted. Finally, the Multithreaded Application Real-Time executor (MARTe) framework is used for building applications particularly optimised for exploring multicore architectures. In the past year, four new systems based on this philosophy have been installed and are now part of the JET’s routine operation. The focus of the present work is on the configuration and interconnection of the ingredients that enable these new systems’ real-time capability and on the impact that JET’s distributed real-time architecture has on system engineering requirements, such as algorithm testing and plant commissioning. Details are given about the common real-time configuration and development path of these systems, followed by a brief description of each system together with results regarding their real-time performance. A cycle time jitter analysis of a user-space MARTe based application <b>synchronising</b> over a <b>network</b> is also presented. The goal is to compare its deterministic performance while running on a vanilla and on a Messaging Real time Grid (MRG) Linux kernel...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{is to improve the}} {{understanding}} of the performance of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers that use assistance data provided by cellular networks. A typical example of such a receiver is a mobile phone including a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. Using assistance data such as an accurate estimate of the GPS system time is known to improve the availability and the time-tofirst- fix performance of a GNSS receiver. However, the performance depends on the architecture of the cellular network and may vary significantly across networks. This thesis presents three new contributions to the performance analysis of assisted-GNSS receivers in cellular networks. I first introduce a mathematical framework {{that can be used to}} calculate a theoretical lower bound of the time-to-first-fix (TTFF) in an assisted-GNSS receiver. Existing methods, for example the flow-graph method, generally focus on calculating the theoretical mean acquisition time of a pseudo-noise signal for one satellite only. I extend these methods to calculate the full probability distribution of the joint acquisition of several satellites, as well as the sequential acquisition of satellites, which is commonly performed in assisted receivers. The method is applied to real measurements made in a multipath fading channel. I next consider time assistance in unsynchronised cellular networks. It is often argued that unsynchronised networks can not provide fine-time aiding since they do not have a common clock, although few experimental results have been reported in the existing literature. I carried out experiments on a GSM network, a second-generation cellular network, in Cambridge, UK, in order to measure the time stability of the synchronisation signals. The results showed a large variability in the time stabilities across different base stations and I evaluated the performance of an ensemble filter that combines the measurements into a single, more accurate, estimate of the universal time. The main contribution is to show that the performance of such a filter is adequate to provide fine-time assistance to a satellite navigation receiver. Finally, I address the positioning performance of an assisted receiver in <b>synchronised</b> cellular <b>networks.</b> Cellular positioning has been often investigated in the literature, but few results on real networks have been presented. Many positioning methods are proprietary and little information about their performance in real networks haven been published publicly. A CDMA 2000 cellular network in Calgary, Canada, was used to collect experimental data. The time stability and the synchronisation of the CDMA 2000 pilot signals were excellent and were used to evaluate the performance of CDMA 2000 -based cellular positioning system. I then developed a method to combine the pseudo-range measurements from the GPS signals and the CDMA 2000 base stations. I evaluated the performance of positioning in both outdoor and indoor environments, and I analysed the effects and the possible mitigation of non-line-of-sight signals. The main contribution is to show that additional satellite navigation signals can improve the accuracy of cellular positioning beyond what is theoretically expected from the improvement in the geometry.
