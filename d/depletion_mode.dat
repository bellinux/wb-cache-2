30|$|The {{advantage}} of NW as a semiconducting channel in FeFET memory devices is the sensitive changes in conductance and the inherently small scale of each device, {{leading to a}} high memory device density. Single-crystalline nanowires and nanotubes often feature greater mobility and lower swing, allowing FET devices to operate at higher speed and lower power consumption. Because NW FETs function in accumulation and <b>depletion</b> <b>modes,</b> they allow lower operation voltage than thin-film FETs operating in inversion mode. Lower operation voltage in FeFETs can reduce the depolarization field in the ferroelectric layer and the charge trapping induced at the semiconducting/ferroelectric interface, leading to a longer memory state retention time [1, 2]. Furthermore, to form an omega-shaped-gate FeFET structure [20], the Si NW was coated with P(VDF-TrFE). Without a gate dielectric layer, the polarization of the ferroelectric layer will affect directly {{on the surface of}} the NW. This provides a more effective electric field with respect to the NW FET than the omega-shaped-gate and planar-gate FETs. FeFET devices are also expected to exhibit a lower operation voltage, higher field effect mobility, higher transconductance, and higher ION/IOFF ratio than the other devices [20].|$|R

Potential applications such as SRAM, lower power logic and RF IC have been demonstrated by major semiconductor companies. In this thesis, many remaining issues ranging from device physics to circuit modeling have been addressed. The impacts of silicon film thickness and channel width scaling on Re-oxidized MESA isolation were studied. The subthreshold characteristics and narrow width effect are explained through the geometry of device edge resulted from the sidewall reoxidation. Several major issues of floating body SOI MOSFET's are addressed in this thesis. The frequency dispersion of output resistance (Rout) in partially depleted device was studied. The effect is explained by the floating body potential fluctuation under the combined influence of hole accumulation in the neutral body and capacitive coupling. Next, capacitive coupling effect was studied theoretically and experimentally. The body charge model for bulk MOSFET was evaluated for its accuracy in predicting the coupling effect. A simple technique was also proposed to characterize the gate coupling factor.

This limits the temporal intensity contrast, the signal to noise of the primary pulse intensity in time. This thesis presents a detailed investigation into the noise sources that degrade the contrast of high-power laser pulses created for laser-matter interaction experiments. To achieve this, a high-contrast multi-terawatt peak-power laser system, named Cerberus, has been developed to deliver up to 5 J, 500 fs pulses (10 TW) using an optical parametric chirped pulse amplification (OPCPA) front-end and Nd:Glass laser rod power amplifiers. To compliment this study, > 10 ^ 10 dynamic range diagnostics have been developed that measure these noise sources {{in the presence of the}} intense primary pulse. Parametric fluorescence noise from parametric amplifiers was measured with a diagnostic able to observe the real-time seeded OPCPA fluorescence noise emission and determined the fluorescence emission to be directly linked to the level of pump-depletion, with a 500 times contrast enhancement from the undepleted to maximum pump <b>depletion</b> <b>modes</b> of operation. A combination of picosecond-pumped OPCPA and nanosecond-pumped OPCPA amplifiers effectively suppresses the longer timescale parametric fluorescence to > 10 ^ 8 - 10 ^ 10 contrast.

Polymeric beads and Alexa Fluor 594 -phalloidin labeled cellular actin structures of cultured cells were imaged below the diffraction limit using stimulated emission depletion to resolve structures to about 40 nm. Lifetime imaging revealed a 2. 0 Â± 0. 1 ns lifetime for fluorescently-labeled beads in confocal and <b>depletion</b> imaging <b>modes.</b> <b>Depletion</b> imaging was also able to display a change of 2. 2 to 2. 9 ns for {{different regions of the}} cellular actin network of cultured cells with a possible difference in lifetime caused by tryptophan quenching of the dye. Subdiffraction imaging with a resolution of around 40 nm was also accomplished using luminescence depletion of photostable giant CdSe/ 14 CdS nanocrystal quantum dots in air. Nanocrystal quantum dots, typically not prone to depletion, exhibited this phenomenon when excited with an energy of 50 pJ and 2 nJ of depletion energy. Luminescence depletion required half the energy compared to stimulated emission depletion to achieve the same resolution limit. The luminescence was depleted by as much as about 92 % with no observable photobleaching. Raman measurements of polymer films were performed with 532 -nm laser illumination using scanning angle and conventional 180 Â° backscattering modes to determine chemical information. The scanning angle mode achieved an angle resolution of 0. 09 Â° and was used to probe a thin layer of polystyrene as well as a diblock copolymer of polystyrene and poly(3 -hexylthiophene- 2, 5 -diyl). Enhancements to the Raman signals at selected angles lower than the critical angle for total internal reflection, characteristic of waveguides, were measured. An additional enhancement in the Raman signal results from resonant conditions for the diblock copolymer. The epi-collection geometry was used to gain spectroscopic information regarding to the stability of heterojunction solar cells with the aid of resonance Raman spectroscopy.

The novel heterostructure consisting of a thin strained GaN layer grown on an AlN template exhibits a hole gas density close to the interface polarization charge (∼ 5 × 1013 /cm 2). Both enhancement- and depletion-mode (E/D) p-channel heterostructure field effect transistor (HFETs) are demonstrated. Driven by the high hole density, a 2. 4 -µm-long D-mode HFET with alloyed ohmic contacts shows improvement of drain current from 150 mA/mm (VGS = 12 V, VDS = 30 V) at 300 K to 270 mA/mm (VGS = 15 V, VDS = 30 V) at 77 K. The extrinsic peak transconductance of the D-mode device increases from 11 mS/mm (VGS = 6 V, VDS = 30 V) at 300 K to 16 mS/mm (VGS = 4 V, VDS = 30 V) at 77 K.
