5|$|In {{contrast}} to Matheson's {{opinion about the}} name Ljótr, the 20th-century historian A. Morrison was {{of the opinion that}} the name may not be as rare as some people have thought. Morrison noted that the 19th century antiquary F.W.L. Thomas considered another saga character to be an eponymous ancestor of the MacLeods—this character was Ljótólfr, who would have lived on Lewis about a century before Leod's time. Morrison considered <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> that Leod's name could have ultimately originated from that of Ljótólfr's; however, while he considered <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> that Ljótólfr could have been an ancestor of Leod, he did not think it could have been in the male-line.|$|E

Sterile insect technique is a genetic control method whereby large numbers of sterile male mosquitoes are reared and released. Mating with wild females reduces the wild population in the subsequent generation; repeated releases eventually eliminate the target population.|$|E

These notions are, according to Fodor, our best explanation of mental processes.|$|E
