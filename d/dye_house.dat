2500|$|Under Charney, American Apparel {{implemented}} [...] "team manufacturing" [...] {{as opposed}} to the progressive bundle system of apparel manufacturing. After its implementation, garment production tripled and required a less than 20% staff increase. He formed the company as a domestic vertically-integrated manufacturer, making him the largest manufacturer still producing garments in America. Because of its vertically integrated and domestic manufacturing model, American Apparel's gross margins are actually significantly higher than other basic apparel brands. By utilizing a vertically integrated business model (based on speed-to market), Charney was able to focus merchandise for year round styles, minimizing risk and providing consistent operating results. According to the company, its blended margins are roughly 70% (while GAP averages about 30% and luxury brands like Prada are between 65 and 70%). American Apparel controlled {{a significant portion of the}} value chain to ensure quality, speed to market, and a consistent brand positioning. In December 2007 the company purchased an additional <b>dye</b> <b>house</b> to add to production capacity.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to explore the local textile tradition, {{primarily}} natural dyes and dyeing techniques used in farmhouses of Hälsingland between 1750 - 1870. Issues addressed; why and how were certain organic natural dyestuffs used, which substances were used to create certain colours, and who carried out the dyeing. In the search for knowledge about dyeing, two activities were identified: professional dyeing and home dyeing. To explore these two branches, several historical sources were applied, i. e. literature about dye plants written by scientists, handwritten dyeing manuals for the home, as well as printed manuals for professional/home dyeing. The specific context of farmhouses in Hälsingland created unique socioeconomical preconditions necessary {{for the development of}} the dyeing culture. Before 1820, the local professional <b>dye</b> <b>houses</b> were few, up until this time dyeing was mostly carried out at home. Between 1820 - 1850 several <b>dye</b> <b>houses</b> was established. A correlated assumption from this can be drawn to the decreasing tradition of home dyeing. Results indicate that independently of the context of the dyeing, the origin of the dyestuff was mostly imported and not locally obtained, with a few exceptions. The accessibility and origin of dyestuffs seems to have had an effect on turnout as well. The study show that in the more professionalized settings of the <b>dye</b> <b>houses</b> work was carried out by men, whereas in the domain of the home the work was conducted by women. This in turn could have contributed to the explanation of why that the status of the different methods was regarded differently. The aim is to provide a base for further research.

40|$|The textile {{industry}} {{is one of}} the biggest industrial consumers of water especially <b>dye</b> <b>houses</b> which utilize synthetic dyes and other chemicals. Natural dyes are generally environmental friendly and have many advantages over synthetic dyes with respect to production and application. In recent years, there has been an interest in the application of these dyes due to their bio-degradability and higher compatibility with the environment. A review of previous work in the field of applying dyestuffs of natural source as possible textile dyes is given. From an ecological viewpoint, the substitution of chemical dyes by 'natural products' in textile dyeing may be feasible and may represent not only a strategy to reduce risks and pollutants, but also an opportunity for new markets and new businesses which can develop from the inclusion of ecology in trade policy...|$|R

30|$|More than 0.7 {{million tons}} of organic dyes are {{produced}} each year globally. It is noted that there are over 10, 000 commercially accessible dyes that are classified by their utilization fields, namely acid, reactive, disperse, vat, metal complex, mordant, direct, basic and sulfur dyes. Reactive dyes {{have been identified as}} the most environmentally problematic compounds in textile dye effluents for several reasons. First, reactive dyes are intensively used due to their preferable performance and their increasing market share. Second, they are very soluble and approximately 10 – 15 % of the weight of applied reactive dyes is discharged from the <b>dye</b> <b>houses.</b> Third, conventional wastewater treatment units, which reliance on sorption and aerobic biodegradation, have a low removal output for reactive and other anionic soluble dyes. Consequently, they cause to be colored water channels and public complaints, and the pollutants are being transferred to another phase and not being eliminated (Dojcinovic et al. 2012).|$|R

In the present study, an attempt has been made to investigate the possibility of wool dyeing with Adhatoda vasica extract as a natural dye. A beautiful color palette of shades of varied hue and tone were obtained by using different mordants. The effect of various metal salts (ferrous sulphate, alum and stannous chloride) and natural tannin extracts (gallnut, pomegranate peel and babool bark) as mordants on color and fastness properties of dyed wool samples was comparatively evaluated. Dyeing experiments were performed with and without mordants, using pre-mordanting technique. The color of dyed woolen yarn was investigated in terms of CIELab (L*, a* and b*) and K/S values; and fastness properties were determined as per ISO and AATCC standard test methods. As confirmed by exhaustion studies, a substantial portion of metal salts remained in residual mordant baths. The results of using biomordants for wool dyeing were comparable with that of the metallic mordants in terms of color strength and fastness characterisctics. Biomordants produced quite different color gamuts as expected from a mordant and thus offer full potential to replace metal salts in wool dyeing...|$|R
