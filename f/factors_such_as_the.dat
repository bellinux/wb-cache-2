5|$|Chess {{strategy}} {{is concerned with}} evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and long-term {{plans for the future}} play. During the evaluation, players must take into account numerous <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> value of the pieces on the board, control of the center and centralization, the pawn structure, king safety, and the control of key squares or groups of squares (for example, diagonals, open files, and dark or light squares).|$|E
5|$|Termites can {{distinguish}} nestmates and non-nestmates through chemical communication and gut symbionts: chemicals consisting of hydrocarbons {{released from the}} cuticle allow the recognition of alien termite species. Each colony has its own distinct odour. This odour {{is a result of}} genetic and environmental <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> termites' diet and the composition of the bacteria within the termites' intestines.|$|E
5|$|The Poor Law system {{fell into}} decline at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century owing to <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> introduction of the Liberal welfare reforms and the availability of other sources of assistance from friendly societies and trade unions, as well as piecemeal reforms which bypassed the Poor Law system. The Poor Law system was not formally abolished until the National Assistance Act 1948, with parts of the law remaining on the books until 1967.|$|E

5|$|The {{ships of}} this era had no {{permanent}} battery of guns; guns were completely portable and were often exchanged between ships as situations warranted. Each commanding officer modified his vessel's armaments to his liking while {{taking into consideration}} <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> overall tonnage of cargo, complement of personnel aboard, and planned routes to be sailed. Consequently, a vessel's armament would change often during its career; records of the changes were not generally kept.|$|E
5|$|When {{it is in}} an aqueous solution, {{neptunium}} {{can exist}} in any of its five possible oxidation states (+3 to +7) and each of these show a characteristic color. The stability of each oxidation state {{is strongly dependent on}} various <b>factors,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> presence of oxidizing or reducing agents, pH of the solution, presence of coordination complex-forming ligands, and even the concentration of neptunium in the solution.|$|E
5|$|A {{habitat is}} made up of {{physical}} factors such as soil, moisture, range of temperature, and light intensity as well as biotic <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> availability of food and {{the presence or absence of}} predators. Every organism has certain habitat needs for the conditions in which it will thrive, but some are tolerant of wide variations while others are very specific in their requirements. A habitat is not necessarily a geographical area, it can be the interior of a stem, a rotten log, a rock or a clump of moss, and for a parasitic organism it is the body of its host, part of the host's body such as the digestive tract, or a single cell within the host's body.|$|E
50|$|An {{environmental}} analysis extends beyond just the operating efficiency and emissions. A life-cycle {{assessment of a}} vehicle involves production and post-use considerations. A cradle-to-cradle design {{is more important than}} a focus on a single <b>factor</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> type of fuel.|$|R
50|$|Following several {{accidents}} and incidents where language was a contributory <b>factor</b> (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Tenerife airport disaster: Communication misunderstandings), the International Civil Aviation Organization now requires all civil pilots and Air traffic controllers (working in an international environment) to have a minimum level of English.|$|R

5|$|Cremello or Blue-eyed cream horses have rosy pink skin, {{pale blue}} eyes and cream-colored coats, {{indicating}} that pigment cells and pigment {{are present in the}} skin, eyes, and coat, but at lower levels. Dominant white horses do not have pigment cells, and thus no pigment, in the skin or coat. In addition, dominant white horses seldom have blue eyes. Other genetic factors, or combinations of genetic <b>factors,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> pearl gene or champagne gene, can also produce cremello-like coats. These coat colors may be distinguishable from dominant white by their unusually colored eyes.|$|E
5|$|Dominican {{folk music}} is an oral tradition, learned informally through {{watching}} others perform. As of 1987, most performers of traditional music were either over 50 {{years old or}} under 35, which indicates an ongoing revival of previously declining traditions. Music is evaluated based on both characteristics of the music, such as complex syncopated rhythms, {{as well as social}} <b>factors,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> ability of the performers to improvise and respond to their surroundings and to keep the audience excited and participating in the music.|$|E
5|$|General praise went to {{the variety}} of choice in its {{narrative}} and gameplay, despite the former being seen as lacking in places and the latter being held back by other <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> limitations of the Biomod upgrade system and its limited environment sizes. Poor AI behavior was also a recurring criticism. The Xbox version was praised for its performance and graphics despite several reviewers noting distracting drops in frame rate and other technical issues. The PC version was frequently criticized as having similar frame rate issues in addition to problems with the controls, the necessity for a powerful computer to run the game properly, {{and the fact that}} the game was scaled down to run on the Xbox.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{video game}} {{developer}} and publisher Square Enix (formally two companies called Square and Enix prior to 2003) has been translating its games for North America {{since the late}} 1980s, and the PAL region and Asia since the late 1990s. It has not always released all of its games in all major regions, and continues to selectively release games even today depending on multiple <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> viability of platforms or {{the condition of the}} game itself. The process of localization has changed during that time from having a one-person team with a short time and tight memory capacities to having a team of translators preparing simultaneous launches in multiple languages.|$|E
5|$|The {{expected}} {{number of}} generations for fixation to occur {{is proportional to}} the population size, such that fixation is predicted to occur much more rapidly in smaller populations. Normally the effective population size, which is smaller than the total population, is used to determine these probabilities. The effective population (N'e) takes into account <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> level of inbreeding, the stage of the lifecycle in which the population is the smallest, and the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection. The effective population size may not be the same for every gene in the same population.|$|E
5|$|The {{price and}} value of a Zimbabwean {{banknote}} depend on various factors: the rarity, based on <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> name of capital city, how long it was printed, or the type of watermark; its condition, and the national situation at time of issue, such as shortages or hyperinflation. Common designs and variants such as the $100 note of 1995 (Pick no. 9) are usually valued at about $1 apiece, while rare varieties such as the $10 Salisbury error note (Pick no. 3b) and the Standard Chartered issues are valued at around $100 or more. Zimbabwean banknotes are usually sold by banknote dealers over the counter or on the internet, although the most valued types theoretically qualify for inclusion in auction.|$|E

30|$|Thermi and Chloroflexi were {{negatively}} correlated with phosphorous (p <  0.01). The correlation analysis showed that few dominant bacterial phyla were positively correlated with particular geochemical <b>factor</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Firmicutes with temperature, Ca, Cl, dissolved SiO 2; Thermi and Chloroflexi with pH, Si and elemental S; Proteobacteria specifically correlates with total sulphide (Additional file 1 : Table S 3; Fig.  5). Desulfomicrobiaceae and Desulfobacteraceae. Thermi and Chloroflexi were {{negatively correlated}} with phosphorous (p <  0.01). The correlation analysis showed that few dominant bacterial phyla were positively correlated with particular geochemical <b>factor</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Firmicutes with temperature, Ca, Cl, dissolved SiO 2; Thermi and Chloroflexi with pH, Si and elemental S; Proteobacteria specifically correlates with total sulphide (Additional file 1 : Table S 3; Fig.  5).

5|$|The {{time for}} a neutral allele to become fixed by genetic drift depends on {{population}} size, with fixation occurring more rapidly in smaller populations. The number of individuals in a population is not critical, but instead a measure known as the effective population size. The effective population is usually smaller than the total population since it takes into account <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> level of inbreeding and {{the stage of the}} lifecycle in which the population is the smallest. The effective population size may not be the same for every gene in the same population.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the stages, {{the player}} may enter doors to access seven {{different}} types of chambers. Stores and black markets offer items in exchange for hearts, which are left behind by defeated monsters. Treasure chambers contain items, enemy nests give the player an opportunity to earn extra hearts, and hot springs restore Pit's health. In the god's chamber, the strength of Pit's bow and arrow may be increased depending on several <b>factors,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> number of enemies defeated {{and the amount of}} damage taken in battle. In the training chamber, Pit will be awarded with one of the three power items if he passes a test of endurance.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{ships are}} removed from the fleet by going through {{a process known as}} ship {{breaking}} or scrapping. Ship-owners and buyers negotiate scrap prices based on <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> ship's empty weight (called light ton displacement or LDT) and prices in the scrap metal market. In 1998, almost 700ships were scrapped in places like Alang, India and Chittagong, Bangladesh. This is often done by 'beaching' the ship on open sand, then cutting it apart by hand with gas torches, a dangerous operation that results in injuries and fatalities, as well as exposure to toxic materials such as asbestos, lead, and various chemicals. Half a million deadweight tons worth of bulk carriers were scrapped in 2004, accounting for 4.7% of the year's scrapping. That year, bulkers fetched particularly high scrap prices, between $340 and $350 per LDT.|$|E

50|$|A {{loop gain}} greater than {{one has a}} down side. In theory, the {{oscillator}} amplitude will increase without limit. In practice, the amplitude will increase until the output runs into some limiting <b>factor</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> power supply voltage (the amplifier output runs into the supply rails) or the amplifier output current limits. The limiting reduces the effective gain of the amplifier (the effect is called gain compression). In a stable oscillator, the average loop gain will be one.|$|R
5|$|Historically, {{extractive}} {{industries have}} contributed strongly to New Zealand's economy, focussing {{at different times}} on sealing, whaling, flax, gold, kauri gum, and native timber. With the development of refrigerated shipping in the 1880s meat and dairy products were exported to Britain, a trade which {{provided the basis for}} strong economic growth in New Zealand. High demand for agricultural products from the United Kingdom and the United States helped New Zealanders achieve higher living standards than both Australia and Western Europe in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1973, New Zealand's export market was reduced when the United Kingdom joined the European Community and other compounding <b>factors,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 1973 oil and 1979 energy crisis, led to a severe economic depression. Living standards in New Zealand fell behind those of Australia and Western Europe, and by 1982 New Zealand had the lowest per-capita income of all the developed nations surveyed by the World Bank. In the mid-1980s New Zealand deregulated its agricultural sector by phasing out subsidies over a three-year period. Since 1984, successive governments engaged in major macroeconomic restructuring (known first as Rogernomics and then Ruthanasia), rapidly transforming New Zealand from a protected and highly regulated economy to a liberalised free trade economy.|$|E
5|$|John's {{position}} in France was considerably {{strengthened by the}} victory at Mirebeau, but John's treatment of his new prisoners and of his ally, William de Roches, quickly undermined these gains. De Roches was a powerful Anjou noble, but John largely ignored him, causing considerable offence, whilst the king kept the rebel leaders in such bad conditions that twenty-two of them died. At this time most of the regional nobility were closely linked through kinship, and this behaviour towards their relatives was regarded as unacceptable. William de Roches and other of John's regional allies in Anjou and Brittany deserted him in favour of Philip, and Brittany rose in fresh revolt. John's financial situation was tenuous: once <b>factors</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> comparative military costs of materiel and soldiers were taken into account, Philip enjoyed a considerable, although not overwhelming, advantage of resources over John.|$|E
5|$|The {{diet and}} {{physiology}} of Edmontosaurus have been probed by using stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen as recorded in tooth enamel. When feeding, drinking, and breathing, animals take in carbon and oxygen, which become incorporated into bone. The isotopes {{of these two}} elements are determined by various internal and external <b>factors,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> type of plants being eaten, the physiology of the animal, salinity, and climate. If isotope ratios in fossils are not altered by fossilization and later changes, they can be studied {{for information about the}} original factors; warmblooded animals will have certain isotopic compositions compared to their surroundings, animals that eat certain types of plants or use certain digestive processes will have distinct isotopic compositions, and so on. Enamel is typically used because the structure of the mineral that forms enamel makes it the most resistant material to chemical change in the skeleton.|$|E
50|$|Personal inclinations {{were also}} a decisive <b>factor,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> long-standing {{personal}} aspiration of Pope John-Paul II and Cardinal Ratzinger, {{who had participated in}} the Special Committee of the Holy See that reviewed and authorized the establishment of full relations between Israel and the Vatican. After the decision was made, Ratzinger reportedly called his Jerusalem acquaintance, Professor Zwi Werblowsky to express his joy over the development, describing it <b>as</b> <b>the</b> fruit of the work of the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council.|$|R
50|$|Various chronic {{diseases}} are kept under control by homeostatic compensation, which masks a problem by compensating for it (making up for it) in another way. However, the compensating mechanisms eventually wear out or are disrupted {{by a new}} complicating <b>factor</b> (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> advent of a concurrent acute viral infection), which sends the body reeling through a new cascade of events. Such decompensation unmasks the underlying disease, worsening its symptoms. Common examples include decompensated heart failure, kidney failure, and liver failure.|$|R
5000|$|The {{stationary}} phase is often {{due to a}} growth-limiting <b>factor</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> depletion of an essential nutrient, and/or {{the formation of an}} inhibitory product <b>such</b> <b>as</b> an organic acid. Stationary phase results from a situation in which growth rate and death rate are equal. The number of new cells created is limited by the growth factor and <b>as</b> a result <b>the</b> rate of cell growth matches the rate of cell death. The result is a “smooth,” horizontal linear part of the curve during the {{stationary phase}}.|$|R
