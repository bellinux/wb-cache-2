50|$|Double (two-trailer) {{road train}} {{combinations}} are allowed on some roads {{in most states}} of Australia, including specified approaches to the ports and industrial areas of Adelaide, South Australia and Perth, Western Australia. A <b>double</b> <b>road</b> <b>train</b> {{should not be confused}} with a B-double, which is allowed access to most of the country and in all major cities.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, a B-double would weigh 62.5 t (6 t + 16.5 t + 20 t + 20 t). A <b>double</b> <b>road</b> <b>train</b> {{would have}} an {{operational}} weight (without concessions) of 79 t (6 t + 16.5 t + 20 t + 16.5 t + 20 t). A triple is 79 t + 36.5 t (16.5 t + 20 t), giving an all up weight of 115.5 t. Quads weigh in at 135.5 t. Concessional weight additions (0.5 - 2.5 t per group) can see a quad end up weighing 149 t. If a tri-drive prime mover is utilised, along with tri-axle dollies, weights can reach nearly 170 t.|$|E
50|$|Triple (three-trailer) <b>road</b> <b>trains</b> {{operate in}} western New South Wales, western Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory, {{with the last}} three states also {{allowing}} AB-quads (B double with two additional trailers coupled behind). In South Australia, <b>road</b> <b>trains</b> up to 53.5 m are only permitted on the Stuart Highway and Olympic Dam Highway in the Far North. Darwin is the only capital {{city in the world}} where triples and quads are allowed to within 1 km of the central business district (CBD). Tasmania and Victoria do not allow the operation of <b>road</b> <b>trains</b> on any of their roads. Victoria had previously allowed <b>double</b> <b>road</b> <b>trains</b> to operate around Mildura for the vintage grape harvest.|$|R
50|$|Same as a B-double {{but with}} an {{additional}} lead trailer behind the prime mover. These are run in most states of Australia where <b>double</b> <b>road</b> <b>trains</b> are allowed. There is one exception to that rule: B-triples are operated in Victoria, but by one operator, under a strict permit and on a dedicated route, between the Ford plants at Geelong and Campbellfield. Australia's National Transport Commission proposed a national framework for B-triple operations that includes basic vehicle specifications and operating conditions that the commission anticipates will replace the current state-by-state approach, which largely discourages the use of B-triples for interstate operation.|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} passing {{ability of the}} <b>double</b> {{semitrailer}} <b>road</b> <b>train</b> (B-Train) on highways, we have built the B-Train model and the highway model using TruckSim. Based on an optimal driver preview control model, we analyzed the speed influence on the passing ability of the B-Train when running from a straight road to a curve. The result shows the B-Train's speed range when passing the highway curve with a limited safe turning radius. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThree {{different}} type of double road trains are selected as simulation model, which is commonly used in developed countries and regions {{in order to improve}} the efficiency of road transport and the development of China's logistics industry. The passing ability simulation model of <b>double</b> <b>road</b> <b>train</b> is established based on Auto Turn, and China's current longest tractor-semitrailer is used as a comparison. Simulation models of highway ramp, first class highway and second class highway are established according to the requirement of JTG D 20 - 2006 ‘Design Specification for Highway Alignment’. Adaptability of <b>double</b> <b>road</b> <b>train</b> and highway structure parameter is researched by analyzing {{different type}}s of <b>double</b> <b>road</b> <b>train</b> turn left, turn right and turn around on the road. The type of <b>double</b> <b>road</b> <b>train</b> which can meet China's standards is recommended. The result can promote the application of <b>double</b> <b>road</b> <b>train</b> and give some advice for improving passing ability...|$|E
40|$|To {{analyze the}} {{influence}} of trailer length on the passing ability of a <b>double</b> semi-trailer <b>road</b> <b>train</b> (B-Train), we built a B-Train model by using TruckSim, and confirmed the limit of the steering wheel angle when all wheels of the B-Train moved forward and the turning radius was minimum simultaneously by choosing dry pavement. Then, the turning process was simulated to analyze {{the relationship between the}} trailer length and the turning channel width at low speed. The results showed that increasing trailer length leads to the increase of the turning channel width of B-Train; the turning channel width is larger when the length of the first trailer is increased independently than that when the length of the second trailer is increased independently. In addition, according to the simulation results, we built the relation model between trailer length variation and turning channel width using the least-square theory. No Full Tex...|$|R

50|$|A <b>road</b> <b>train</b> or land {{train is}} a {{trucking}} vehicle {{of a type}} used in rural and remote areas of Australia, Canada, Mexico and the United States, to move freight efficiently. The term <b>road</b> <b>train</b> is mainly used in Australia.

A <b>road</b> <b>train</b> has a relatively normal tractor unit, but instead of towing one trailer or semi-trailer, it pulls {{two or more of}} them.|$|R
