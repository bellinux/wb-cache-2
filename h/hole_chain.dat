40|$|In {{contemporary}} linguistics {{the definition}} of those entities which {{are referred to as}} multiword expressions (MWEs) remains controversial. It is intuitively clear that some words, when appearing together, have some “special bond” in terms of meaning (e. g. black <b>hole,</b> mountain <b>chain),</b> or lexical choice (e. g strong tea, to fill a form), contrary to free combinations. Nevertheless, the great variety of features and anomalous behaviours that these expressions exhibit makes it difficult to organize them into categories and gave rise to a great amount of different and sometimes overlapping terminology. So far, most approaches in corpus linguistics have focused on trying to automatically extract MWEs from corpora by using statistical association measures, while theoretical aspects related to their definition, typology and behaviours arising from quantitative corpus-based studies have not been widely explored, especially for languages with a rich morphology and relatively free word order, such as Italian. I show that a systematic analysis of the empirical behaviour of Italian MWEs in large corpora, with respect to several parameters, such as syntactic and semantic variations, is useful to outline a subcategorization of the expressions in homogeneous sets which approximately correspond to what is intuitively known as multiword units (“polirematiche” in the Italian lexicographic tradition) and lexical collocations.

40|$|Three-dimensional {{electron}} phase space {{holes are}} {{shown to be}} positive charges on the plasma background which produce a radial electric field and force the trapped electron component into an azimuthal drift. In this way electron holes generate magnetic fields in the hole. We solve the cylindrical hole model exactly for the hole charge, electric potential and magnetic field. In electron holes, the magnetic field is amplified on the flux tube of the hole; equivalently, in ion holes the field would be decreased. The flux tube adjacent to the electron hole is magnetically depleted by the external hole dipole field. This causes magnetic filamentation. It is also shown that holes are massive objects, each carrying a finite magnetic moment. Binary magnetic dipole interaction of these moments will cause alignment of the <b>holes</b> into <b>chains</b> along the magnetic field or, in the three-dimensional case, produce a magnetic fabric in the volume of hole formation. Since holes, {{in addition to being}} carriers of charges and magnetic moments, also have finite masses, they behave like quasi-particles, performing ExB, magnetic field, and diamagnetic drifts. In an inhomogeneous magnetic field, their magnetic moments experience torque which causes nutation of the hole around the direction of the magnetic field presumably giving rise to low frequency magnetic modulations like pulsations. A gas of many such holes may allow for a kinetic description in which holes undergo binary dipole interactions. This resembles the polymeric behaviour. Both magnetic field generation and magnetic structure formation is of interest in auroral, solar coronal and shock physics, in particular in the problem of magnetic field filamentation in relativistic foreshocks and cosmic ray acceleration.

The doping-dependent behaviour in these systems is radically different to that in conventional 2 D cuprate networks formed from corner sharing CuO_ 4 plaquettes, and follows from the strongly suppressed inter-plaquette hybridisation resulting from the 90 degree Cu-O-Cu interaction pathway in the chain systems. Spectroscopically, this results in (a) a classical mixed-valent scenario whereby the different final states in the Cu-L_ 3 spectra can be used directly to 'read-off' the Cu valency and (b) a drastic reduction in the dynamic spectral weight transfer from the upper Hubbard band to the low energy scale in the O-K spectra.

The underdoped materials are insulators with hopping transport along the chains, which behave as a one-dimensional disordered system.

40|$|A {{model of}} charge {{transfer}} mechanism from CuO chains to CuO 2 planes {{has been proposed}} to account for doping of the planes, assuming that only chains containing more than three oxygen atoms can contribute to <b>hole</b> transfer. Only <b>chains</b> with length l greater than 4 are assumed to have transferred a certain fraction, approximately 40 %, of the holes created by oxygen atoms added to the chain beyond the first three oxygen atoms. Using the so obtained x dependence of doping, p(x), at constant (room) temperature and utilizing empirical parabolic phase relation Tc(p) (Tc(p) =Tc,max[1 - 82. 6 (p(x) - 0. 16) 2], the Tc versus x dependence is obtained to have two clearly distinguished plateaus at 60 K and 90 K, remarkably fitting to experimental Tc(x). The effect of statistics of CuO chain fragmentation has been included by applying cluster variation method to two dimensional asymmetric next nearest neighbor Ising model that is employed to describe oxygen-chain ordering in basal planes.

The dynamical process of polaron in a polymer chain with impurities is simulated within a non-adiabatic evolution method, in which the electron wave function is described by the time-dependent Schrödinger equation while the polymer lattice is treated classically by a Newtonian equation of motion. We have considered two kinds of dynamical processes, one is the field-induced depinning of a charged polaron, which is initially bound by an attractive impurity; and the other is the scattering of a polaron from an impurity. In the former process, the charged polaron will depart from the attractive impurity only for the applied field with strength over a threshold, otherwise, the polaron will oscillate around the impurity. In the latter process, the charged polaron moves through the impurity in the presence of an electric field while it will be bounced back for a repulsive impurity or trapped to oscillate around an attractive impurity in the case that the applied electric field is weak and just be present for the polaron acceleration.

We furthermore prove M is a reversible and ergodic Markov chain, which leads to our main result: for all λ> 2 +√(2), there is a constant α> 1 such that at stationarity the particles are α-compressed, meaning the perimeter of the particle configuration is at most α times the minimum perimeter for those particles. We additionally show λ> 1 is not enough to guarantee compression: for all 0 <λ< 2. 17, there is a constant β< 1 such that the perimeter is at least a β fraction of the maximum perimeter...|$|R
40|$|The present paper studies, using ab-initio calculations, the {{influence}} of the incommensurate structural modulations on the low energy physics of the Sr 14 −xCaxCu 24 O 41 oxides. On-site, nearest-neighbor and next-nearestneighbor effective parameters were computed within a t − J + V model based on the copper oxide layers. The structural modulations appear to be the key degree of freedom, responsible for the low energy properties such as the electron localization, the formation of dimers in the x = 0 compound or the anti-ferromagnetic order in the x = 13. 6 compound. Key words: Charge order, incommensurate systems, spin chains, ab-initio electronic structure calculations. The Sr 14 −xCaxCu 24 O 41 compounds are composed of alternate layers of weakly-coupled spin ladders and spin chains [1]. The two sub-systems have incommensurate translation vectors in the longitudinal chains and ladders direction with a pseudo-periodicity is of 10 chain units for 7 ladder units. The misfit of the twosubsystems induces a structural modulation of each of them with the periodicity of the other. The low energy properties of the Sr 14 −xCaxCu 24 O 41 compounds are different both from those of uniform ladders and of uniform chains. In addition their electronic structure is strongly dependent on the substitution of the strontium by the isovalent calcium counter-ion. Formal-charge analysis shows that these systems are intrinsically doped with six holes per formula unit (f. u.). Similar to high-Tc superconductors, the spins are supported by 3 d orbitals of the Cu 2 + ions while the holes are expected to be mainly supported by the oxygen 2 p orbitals and to form Zhang-Rice singlets [2] (ZRS). The hole repartition between the chain and ladder subsystems is still under debate. For the undoped compound, Madelung potential calculations [3] suggest a localization of the 6 <b>holes</b> on the <b>chains...</b>|$|R
