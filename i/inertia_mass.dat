40|$|Authors have {{proposed}} {{a new type of}} vibration suppression device that utilizes variable <b>inertia</b> <b>mass</b> by fluid which acts as a series <b>inertia</b> <b>mass.</b> The series <b>inertia</b> <b>mass</b> is proportional to not only square of a ratio between a diameter of a piston cylinder and a by-pass pipe, and also a density of the fluid. The resisting force characteristics in case of water or turbine oil were measured. To confirm the proposed theory and investigate effects of vibration control, vibration tests of frequency response and seismic response of one-degree-of-freedom system with the test device were carried out. The experimental results were compared with the calculated results, and the effects of vibration suppression are confirmed experimentally and theoretically. In this paper, in order to derive the effect of a variable <b>inertia</b> <b>mass</b> by using a magnet-rheological fluid, resisting force characteristics of the test device are measured in several cases of magnetic field. The orifice of the by-pass pipe can be changed in virtual, since some rare-earth magnets are installed around the by-pass pipe. It can be seen from experimental results that the inertia force is increasing as stronger magnetic fields. It is pointed out that the variable <b>inertia</b> <b>mass</b> can be derived since clustered magnetic particles in the by-pass pipe act as a virtual orifice under strong magnetic field.

3000|$|This control {{approach}} can {{be treated as a}} Variable Admittance Control Algorithm (VACA) because the <b>inertia</b> <b>mass</b> (m 1) varies with time. The algorithm is novel in the senses that (1) unlike the state-of-the-art practice [13], only the <b>inertia</b> <b>mass</b> (m 1) varies instead of the gravity mass (m 2), which can help change (reduce) the PLF and peak acceleration without changing haptic perceptions (such changes may adversely affect the HRI), and (2) optimum m 1 and m 2 values are used. The proposed control is practical as the exponential decay is triggered by a position threshold instead of an instantaneous time threshold. The exponential decay of m 1 needs to start when/before the peak load force is the maximum. We know from the literature that the peak load force is the maximum when the subject just starts lifting at the very initial phase of lifting [18]. The position threshold can successfully indicate such initial phase and can be very general. In contrast, if we use a time-based threshold, e.g., if the control strategy arranges an exponential decay of m 1 starting at a particular time, then generalization of this particular time is difficult. The proposed position-based threshold approach is an empirical ad hoc approach that may also require additional effort to tune {{in the case of a}} different target pose. But, in all lifting trials, the object must cross/pass the initial phase of lifting along its trajectory (here, 0.01  m for lightweight object). The position-based condition [...] x > x_th as Fig.  9 shows can cover a wide range of target poses. Even though the position/displacement-based thresholds may need to be adjusted if the targeted manipulation trajectory length increases/decreases significantly, it is easy to adjust such situations.|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{adiabatic}} {{picture for}} heavy-ion reactions, {{in which the}} neck formation in the one-body system is taken into account, we propose a two-step model for fusion cross sections at deep subbarrier energies. This model consists of the capture process in the two-body potential pocket, which {{is followed by the}} penetration of the adiabatic one-body potential to reach a compound state after the touching configuration. We describe the former process with the coupled-channels framework, while the latter with the WKB approximation by taking into account the coordinate dependent <b>inertia</b> <b>mass.</b> The effect of the one-body barrier is important at incident energies below the potential energy at the touching configuration. We show that this model well accounts for the steep fall-off phenomenon of fusion cross sections at deep subbarrier energies for the $^{ 64 }$Ni+$^{ 64 }$Ni and $^{ 58 }$Ni+$^{ 58 }$Ni reactions.

A electro-mechanical analogy is drawn where the dynamics of hyperplanes is determined by interaction forces between hyperplanes and the particles which represent the patterns. Relaxation of the system is determined by increasing hyperplane <b>inertia</b> (<b>mass).</b> This picture is used to clarify the dynamics of learning, and to go some way to explaining learning deadlocks and escaping from certain local minima.
