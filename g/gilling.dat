5|$|After Wilfrid's {{return to}} Northumbria in about 658, Cenwalh, King of Wessex, {{recommended}} Wilfrid to Alhfrith, Oswiu's son, as a cleric well-versed in Roman customs and liturgy. Alhfrith was a sub-king of Deiria under his father's rule, {{and the most}} likely heir to his father's throne as his half-brothers were still young. Shortly before 664 Alhfrith gave Wilfrid a monastery he had recently founded at Ripon, formed around a group of monks from Melrose Abbey, followers of the Irish monastic customs. Wilfrid ejected the abbot, Eata, because he would not follow the Roman customs; Cuthbert, later a saint, was another of the monks expelled. Wilfrid introduced the Rule of Saint Benedict into Ripon, claiming {{that he was the}} first person in England to make a monastery follow it, but this claim rests on the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi and does not say where Wilfrid became knowledgeable about the Rule, nor exactly what form of the Rule was being referred to. Shortly afterwards Wilfrid was ordained a priest by Agilbert, Bishop of Dorchester in the kingdom of the Gewisse, part of Wessex. Wilfrid was a protégé of Agilbert, who later helped in Wilfrid's consecration as a bishop. The monk Ceolfrith was attracted to Ripon from <b>Gilling</b> Abbey, which had recently been depopulated {{as a result of the}} plague. Ceolfrith later became Abbot of Wearmouth-Jarrow during the time the medieval chronicler and writer Bede was a monk there. Bede hardly mentions the relationship between Ceolfrith and Wilfrid, but it was Wilfrid who consecrated Ceolfrith a priest and who gave permission for him to transfer to Wearmouth-Jarrow.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} expiate {{the killing of}} Oswine, who was later {{reckoned}} a saint, Oswiu established <b>Gilling</b> Abbey at <b>Gilling,</b> where prayers were said for Oswine and for Oswiu. Oswine was followed as king of the Deirans by Oswald's son Œthelwald.|$|E

25|$|During {{his visit}} Ranjitsinhji resumed his {{first-class}} cricket {{career in the}} 1908 season, and also visited the Borrisow family in <b>Gilling</b> East. At the time, he was contemplating marriage and locals believed {{he was in love}} with Edith Borrisow. While he may have pursued the matter, objections from her father and the potential scandal in both British and Rajput circles at a mixed-race marriage prevented anything coming of it. In August 1908, Ranjitsinhji became involved in fund raising to restore the bell-tower of <b>Gilling</b> East parish church and to furnish it with a clock; he organised a cricket match involving famous cricketers playing against a local team and raised money through the sale of a photograph.|$|E

25|$|Pickering {{was flooded}} after Pickering Beck overflowed its banks. On 18 July, streams overflowed and roads were blocked in Barton, <b>Gilling</b> West, Melsonby, Hartforth, Scotch Corner, Middleton Tyas and Kirby Hill after a freak rainstorm, and on 18 July 2007 a cloud burst left parts of Filey under 3feet(1m) of water, just {{caused by the}} rain, rather than by a river {{bursting}} its banks. Pensioners were stranded in the town's swimming pool and rescued by lifeboat.|$|E
25|$|Ranjitsinhji {{managed to}} raise enough money, {{probably}} through a loan, {{to head off}} the threat of bankruptcy. After spending time with Pratap Singh who was in London for the coronation of Edward VII, Ranjitsinhji went to <b>Gilling</b> East in Yorkshire, where the Reverend Borrisow now lived. He spent the winter there, adding to the speculation surrounding him. He became very close to Borrisow's eldest daughter, Edith, and the pair may have become engaged around this time.|$|E
25|$|Oswiu was {{a devoted}} Christian, {{promoting}} the faith among his subjects {{and establishing a}} number of monasteries, including <b>Gilling</b> Abbey and Whitby Abbey. He {{was raised in the}} Celtic Christian tradition of much of the Irish world, rather than the Roman tradition practiced by the southern Anglo-Saxon kingdoms as well as some members of the Deiran nobility, including Oswiu's queen Eanflæd. In 664, Oswiu presided over the Synod of Whitby, where clerics debated over the two traditions, and helped resolve tension between the parties by decreeing that Northumbria would follow the Roman style. Oswiu died in 670 and was succeeded by his son, Ecgfrith.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gill</b> slits are {{individual}} openings to <b>gills,</b> i.e., multiple <b>gill</b> arches, which lack {{a single}} outer cover. Such <b>gills</b> {{are characteristic of}} cartilaginous fish such as sharks, and rays, as well as primitive fish such as lampreys. In contrast, bony fishes have a single outer bony <b>gill</b> covering called an operculum.|$|R
25|$|When Ranjitsinhji {{returned}} to India in 1915, Edith Borrisow remained in England. Her {{father died in}} 1917 {{and she and her}} sister moved away from <b>Gilling,</b> eventually settling in Staines (where Ranjitsinhji had a house). According to cricket writer E. H. D. Sewell, to whom Ranjitsinhji told the story, Ranjitsinhji asked Edith to marry him following her father's death. However, she refused as she {{had fallen in love with}} someone else, and the engagement ended after 18 years. Sewell also claimed that her father had come to approve of the proposed marriage. However, the story may not be reliable and Simon Wilde speculates that Borrisow had simply tired of waiting and broke off the engagement. It is likely the pair remained friends, but Ranjitsinhji was deeply affected by the end of the relationship.|$|E
25|$|Also part of {{the medical}} village are Eden Court Medical Practice and Castle Vale Primary Care Centre. Castle Vale Primary Care Centre was officially opened on 21 February 2005 by then-Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, {{although}} it had opened to patients on 13 December 2004 having been completed seven weeks ahead of schedule. Building work was undertaken by Costain Group and the building was designed by <b>Gilling</b> Dod. It is managed by Eastern Birmingham Primary Care Trust. It was constructed to replace a previous centre and is {{twice the size of}} its predecessor, allowing minor surgical operations to be performed at the centre. The building cost £4 million, £1 million of which was given by the Castle Vale Housing Action Trust with the rest funded by the NHS. Eden Court is further along Tangmere Drive and is a GP surgery operated by the NHS. The building was opened in 2001 and features a courtyard in the centre. As well as serving the needs of the local area, the building is also used by medical students.|$|E

A later testimonial described them as [...] "peaceable and first-class sailors."

During breaks in filming, the singer accepted an offer from Paul Christie (Mondo Rock) and Kevin Borich to join their part-time band The Party Boys with Harvey James from Sherbet and Graham Bidstrup from The Angels. The group played a short run of shows around Sydney venues and played covers exclusively. The resultant album, Live at Several 21sts, peaked at No. 9 on the national chart.|$|E

The <b>gills</b> of vertebrates typically develop in the walls of the pharynx, along a series of <b>gill</b> slits opening to the exterior.

500|$|When {{he arrived}} at St Ippolyts Lax had trees planted in the vicarage grounds {{in the form of}} his {{initials}} [...] "W L". That same year he created a park opposite to the vicarage similar to The Backs of Cambridge, built a replica of Trinity College Bridge, dammed the stream and opened springs to form a lake which was used for ice skating in the winter. In September 1801 he married Margaret Cradock (11 June 1776 – 20 January 1854) at the church in <b>Gilling</b> West in the North Riding of Yorkshire. Margaret was the eldest daughter of Sheldon Cradock of Hartforth who was the lord of the manor of Lax's home village of Ravensworth. Lax was a proposer of Robert Woodhouse, Henry Coddington, Herbert Marsh and John Bell for Royal Society fellowship, the latter being one of Lax's closest friends, and he was a keen supporter of George Biddell Airy throughout Airy's career. Lax was a chief supporter of the Whig John Romilly, 1st Baron Romilly's parliamentary bid. In 1824 Lax purchased a coat of arms for himself.|$|E
