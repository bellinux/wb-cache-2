50|$|Dazzlers emit {{infrared}} or invisible light against various electronic sensors, {{and visible}} light against humans, {{when they are}} intended to cause no long-term damage to eyes. The emitters are usually lasers, making what is termed a laser dazzler. Most of the contemporary systems are man-portable, and operate in either the red (a laser diode) or green (a <b>diode-pumped</b> <b>solid-state</b> <b>laser,</b> DPSS) areas of the electromagnetic spectrum. The green laser is chosen for its unique ability to react with the human eye. The green laser is less harmful to human eyes.|$|E

50|$|In 2012, Nichia and OSRAM {{developed}} and manufactured commercial high-power green laser diodes (515/520 nm), which compete with traditional <b>diode-pumped</b> <b>solid-state</b> <b>lasers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Diode-pumped</b> <b>solid-state</b> <b>lasers</b> (DPSSLs) [...] are <b>solid-state</b> <b>lasers</b> made by pumping a solid gain medium, for example, a ruby or a neodymium-doped YAG crystal, with a laser diode.|$|R
50|$|A Dazzler is a directed-energy weapon {{intended}} to temporarily blind or disorient its target with intense directed radiation. Targets can include sensors or human vision. Dazzlers emit infrared or invisible light against various electronic sensors, and visible light against humans, {{when they are}} {{intended to}} cause no long-term damage to eyes. The emitters are usually lasers, making what is termed a laser dazzler. Most of the contemporary systems are man-portable, and operate in either the red (a laser diode) or green (a <b>diode-pumped</b> <b>solid-state</b> <b>laser,</b> DPSS) areas of the electromagnetic spectrum.|$|E
5000|$|The {{low-cost}} {{availability of}} infrared (IR) diode laser modules {{of up to}} 1000 mW (1 watt) output has created a generation of IR-pumped, frequency doubled, green, blue, and violet <b>diode-pumped</b> <b>solid-state</b> <b>laser</b> pointers with visible power up to 300 mW. Because the invisible IR component in the beams of these visible lasers is difficult to filter out, and also because filtering it contributes extra heat which is difficult to dissipate in a small pocket [...] "laser pointer" [...] package, it is often left as a beam component in cheaper high-power pointers. This invisible IR component causes a degree of extra potential hazard in these devices when pointed at nearby objects and people.|$|E
50|$|The module {{constructed}} by Lee et al. implemented a tilted mirror plate that was positioned underneath the sample substrate. This conductive mirror was tilted at 45° and successfully reflected the illuminating laser to a focused spot directly underneath the conductive tip. The steering mirror was {{employed as a}} means of controlling the trajectory of the laser source, with this addition the position of the reflected beam on the sample could be easily adjusted for placement underneath the AFM tip. The illumination laser source was a <b>diode-pumped</b> <b>solid-state</b> <b>laser</b> system that produced a wavelength of 532 nm and a spot of 1 mm in the sample.The addition of the mirror and laser underneath the sample substrate results in a higher scanning level due to raising the sample substrate. This configuration has no effect on any other instrument component and does not affect AFM performance. This result was confirmed by identical topographical images that were taken with and without the placement of the mirror and laser. This particular set-up required the separation of the x, y and z piezo-scanners The separation of piezo-tubes accounts for the elimination of x-z cross-coupling and scanning-size errors, which is common in traditional AFM.|$|E

UV diode lasers have been demonstrated using Ce:LiSAF crystals (cerium-doped lithium strontium aluminum fluoride), a process developed in the 1990s at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

40|$|Scaling single-frequency {{and visible}} intracavity-frequency-doubled <b>diode-pumped</b> <b>solid-state</b> <b>lasers</b> to multi-watt power levels {{is an area}} in which has {{attracted}} a great deal of interest due to the many potential applications of such sources. Ideally this should be achieved with the high overall efficiencies that have been such a notable feature of many lower power <b>diode-pumped</b> <b>solid-state</b> <b>lasers.</b> However, power scaling of the diode array pump lasers has led to output beams which are characteristically very asymmetric with M 2 beam quality factors for orthogonal planes which typically differ by a factor of more than a 1000. This has rendered these devices very difficult to focus to small spot sizes and to use efficiently in end-pumped configuration...|$|R

40|$|Rare earth-doped fibres are a <b>diode-pumped,</b> <b>solid-state</b> <b>laser</b> {{architecture}} {{that is highly}} scalable in average power. The performance of pulsed fibre laser systems is restricted due to nonlinear effects. Hence, fibre designs that allow for very large mode areas at high average powers with diffraction-limited beam quality are of enormous interest. Ytterbium-doped, rod-type, large-pitch fibres (LPF) enable extreme fibre dimensions, i. e., effective single-mode fibres with mode sizes exceeding 100 times the wavelength of the guided radiation, by exploiting the novel concept of delocalisation of higher-order transverse modes. The non-resonant nature of the operating principle makes LPF suitable for high power extraction. This design allows for an unparalleled level of performance in pulsed fibre lasers...|$|E
