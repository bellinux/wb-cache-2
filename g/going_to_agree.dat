2500|$|In June, IAEA {{director}} Mohammad ElBaradei {{suggested that}} Iran {{should be allowed}} limited uranium enrichment under strict supervision of the IAEA. His remarks were formally criticised by Nicholas Burns, the US Under-Secretary of State, who said: [...] "We are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> to accept limited enrichment." [...] ElBaradei later criticized the US position and said, [...] "I have seen the Iranians ready to accept putting a cap on their enrichment [...] in terms of tens of centrifuges, and then in terms of hundreds of centrifuges. But nobody even tried to engage them on these offers. Now Iran has 5,000 centrifuges. The line was, 'Iran will buckle under pressure.' But this issue has become so ingrained in the Iranian soul {{as a matter of}} national pride." ...|$|E
2500|$|Earnhardt is a {{longtime}} opponent of the modern display of the Confederate flag at NASCAR events. He wrote in his 2001 autobiography Driver #8 about his experience being asked about the flag in a Q at Richmond International Raceway the previous year. [...] "I think it means something different to me {{than it does to}} y'all..." [...] he responded. He has distanced himself from race fans who display the flag, telling Mike Wallace in 2004 [...] "It never really was me." [...] In 2006, Earnhardt told Dan Wetzel of Yahoo! Sports: [...] "We live in a country where you can speak freely and do as you may. I don't know (if) what that flag stands for is the same for me as it is the guy who might have it flying out there. I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> with everything everybody does all my life. So I don't have any control over it." [...] Following the Charleston church shooting in 2015, Earnhardt told reporters: [...] "I think it's offensive to an entire race. It does nothing for anybody to be there flying, so I don't see any reason. It belongs in the history books and that's about it." ...|$|E
50|$|On July 31, the Ottawa Senators and Antoine Vermette avoided <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{arbitration}} by <b>agreeing</b> <b>to</b> {{terms on}} a new two-year contract worth US$5.525 million. Vermette would make $2.525 million for the 2008-09 season, and $3 million in the 2009-10 season.|$|R
50|$|Poverty was perpetuated in Dublin by {{the lack}} of work for unskilled workers, who lacked any form of {{representation}} before trade unions were founded. These unskilled workers often had to compete with one another for work every day, the job generally <b>going</b> <b>to</b> whoever <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> work for the lowest wages. The hiring was done in pubs, resulting in alcoholism - if you didn't take drink with the foreman, and buy him drink, you would not be hired.|$|R

5000|$|In August 2008 the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights {{filed suit}} against the Madera Unified School District on behalf of three Latino residents. The plaintiffs pointed out that while 82 percent of {{students}} in Madera were Latino, {{only one out of}} seven board members was Latino. [...] The city, instead of <b>going</b> <b>to</b> trial, <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> draw district lines. The district spokesman, Jake Bragonier, said the decision to avoid trial was a [...] "business decision"(referring to the possibility of having to pay attorney's fees).|$|R
5000|$|On June 26, 2013, Paul told ABC News {{that the}} ruling in United States v. Windsor by the US Supreme Court was {{appropriate}} {{and the issue}} {{should be left to}} the states.

The party is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> disagree on some of these issues." [...] He praised and agreed with Justice Anthony Kennedy for preventing a [...] "culture war", whom he called [...] "someone who doesn't just want to be in front of opinion but wants government to keep up with opinion." [...] He said Kennedy [...] "tried to strike a balance." [...] Also that same day, while talking with Glenn Beck, Paul responded to Glenn Beck by asking whether or not the United States v. Windsor has to apply only to humans, but later clarified his remarks on Fox News by saying [...] "I don't think it will be with multiple humans and I think it will be human and human." ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{many years}} as an {{attorney}} and {{as head of the}} ADL, Livingston retired, and he died on June 13, 1946 in Highland Park, Illinois, at the age of 73. He was survived by his wife Hilda and a son Richard. In appreciation for his many years of service, B'nai B'rith established ten fellowships in his memory. The original awards were $2000, with the money <b>going</b> <b>to</b> students who <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> do research into prejudice and study [...] "racial and cultural relations" [...] ("Livingston Awards" [...] 63).|$|R
60|$|The {{words came}} {{from him in}} a strangled bleat. His whole being was paralysed by a clammy horror. This was beyond the uttermost limit of his fears. And, to {{complete}} the terror of the moment, he knew, even while he rebelled against the insane lawlessness of her scheme, that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> to it, and--worst of all--that deep, deep down in him {{there was a feeling}} toward it which did not dare to come to the surface but which he knew to be approval.|$|E

"Don't you men {{sometimes}} realize," [...] {{she continued}} earnestly, [...] "the many, many guises in which temptation {{may come to}} a woman, especially to the young girl so far from home? She may be very lonely, and she may care; and if she cares, it {{is so hard to}} refuse the man she loves. The very sweetness, the very generosity of a woman's nature prompts her to give, give, give all the time. There are other women, similarly circumstanced, who think only of themselves, of their own safety and happiness, and they escape the danger; but are they to be praised and respected, while she that yields is condemned and cast out? I feel that you are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> with me, and I do not wish to argue with you; but what I so passionately object to is the sweeping judgment you make--the sheep {{on one side and the}} goats on the other. That is how man judges; God looks further. Every case is different. The law by which one should be judged may be poor justice for another." ...|$|E
5000|$|At the hearing, Dear also said: [...] "You're not my lawyer" [...] and [...] "I {{will not}} {{meet with him}} again" [...] and said [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> to mental health {{evaluations}} so they can't put me on psychotropic drugs so I can't talk like the Batman guy"—a reference to Holmes.|$|E

It is her [...] "name day" [...] {{at the beginning}} of the play and though she insists she is grown-up she is still enchanted by things such as a spinning top brought to her by Fedotik. Her only desire is to go back to Moscow, which they left eleven years before the play begins. She believes she will find her true love in Moscow, but when it becomes clear that they are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Moscow, she <b>agrees</b> <b>to</b> marry the Baron Tuzenbach, whom she admires but does not love. She gets her teaching degree and plans to leave with the Baron, but he is shot by Solyony in a pointless duel. She decides to leave anyway and dedicate her life to work and service.|$|R
6000|$|The gracious Duncan, finding matters {{were at a}} stand {{among the}} workmen, summoned before him the delinquents, and {{impressed}} all who heard him {{with a sense of}} his authority, by the penalties with which he threatened them for their delay. Mulcting them in half their charge, he assured them, would be the least of it; for, if they were to neglect his pleasure and the Duke's, [...] "he would be tamn'd if he paid them the t'other half either, and they might seek law for it where they could get it." [...] The work-people humbled themselves before the offended dignitary, and spake him soft and fair; and at length, upon Mr. Butler recalling to his mind that it was the ordination-day, and that the workmen were probably thinking of <b>going</b> <b>to</b> church, Knockdunder <b>agreed</b> <b>to</b> forgive them, out of respect to their new minister.|$|R
5000|$|Writing in {{response}} to an article by Howard Jacobson which sought to place Seven Jewish Children and other criticism of Israel {{in the context of a}} rise in anti-Semitism, Churchill defended herself: “Howard Jacobson writes as if there’s something new about describing critics of Israel as anti-Semitic. But it’s the usual tactic. We are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> about politics … But we should be able to disagree without accusations of anti-Semitism." [...] The play was about the difficulties of explaining violence to children. Its length meant favourable and unfavourable information about Israel had been omitted, she said.|$|E

Vanessa suggests that she could carry one of Zoe's frozen embryos, and Zoe readily agrees. They learn that since the embryos are Max's children too, Max must agree for Zoe and Vanessa to try to use the embryos. Zoe asks Max if he will agree, and Max, confused and stricken, tells her he will think about it. Zoe and Vanessa, thinking that Max is surely <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree,</b> begin thinking of names and furnishing the baby's room. Meanwhile, Zoe is working with a rebellious teenage girl named Lucy, who is hostile and angry.|$|E

Now a camera operator follows him everywhere, filming his life, work and friends, and the only requirement for Kolyan is to live honestly. In such a simple way, the authors of [...] "Swell Guys" [...] involved the whole city in the production of the series: most of the characters (and in the series there are more than 150), - are non-professional actors, ordinary urban residents, often acting under their own names. Sitkom had no fixed scenario, but was shot on the basis of an episode-after-episode plan, the dialogues were invented by the actors, the director and the producers: ...|$|R

5000|$|Bryce {{describes}} himself as an agnostic about global warming and climate change.

In chapter 15 of 'Power Hungry: The Myths of [...] "Green" [...] Energy and the Real Fuels of the Future, Bryce writes:"There’s no question that carbon dioxide plays a significant role in the atmosphere. Just how significant, we don’t know...For me, in many ways, the science no longer matters because discussions about the science have become so vituperative and politicized. Thus, my position about the science of global climate change is one of resolute agnosticism. When it comes to climate change, the key issues are no longer about forcings, albedo, or the ideal concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Instead, the key question is about policy, namely: if we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> that carbon dioxide is bad, what are we supposed to do? And that question—as the Duke of Bilgewater memorably put it in Huckleberry Finn—'is the bare bodkin.” ...|$|E

40|$|Habib and Taylor's {{response}} to our arguments in favour of COSATU remaining within the Tripartite Alliance was more eloquent than enlightening. But if our exchange with them has served to stake out the positions in what is probably <b>going</b> <b>to</b> become an enduring debate, then it will have served some useful purpose. For the moment, {{it would seem that}} we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>agree</b> <b>to</b> disagree. None the less, in what will be our parting shot (for the moment, at least), we want to offer some final observations which follow from Habib and Taylor's alarming failure to refer to the burgeoning comparative literature on trade unions and politics. Let us {{look at some of the}} specific issues they raise from this wider perspective. Firstly, there is the question as to the benefits of the tripartite alliance. The contemporary literature on trade union growth and decline is voluminous, but one of the central arguments is whether the pressures unions have to contend with in the late 1990 s are primarily the result of state policies or global economic forces. Our reading is that there seems to be something of a consensus building around the greater weight of the latter (see, for instance, Godard 1997, Kelly 1997). In brutal sum, it would seem that the pressures associated with globalization can be ameliorated, but not eliminated by national institutions. Delinking from the world economy (Amin 1990) is simply not a serious option in the late 1990 s. Given the interconnected nature of the world system- and the overwhelming predominance of the Western powers- individual national governments have little choice but to follow certain broad macroeconomic strategies, certainly in the short and medium terms (Gill and Law 1988 : 68). However, the outlook is not as depressing as may first seem. As noted earlier, national institutions may ameliorate or exacerbate the pressure...|$|R
