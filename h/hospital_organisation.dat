In {{his retirement in}} northern England (Northumbria), at the family home at Rock, he became a respected local archaeologist, but published little of his great store of knowledge on the nature and date of Roman imports north of the frontiers in Britain, Holland, Germany and Denmark. In retirement, he had written to his son Charles in 1927: ‘That the attraction of this place and its tradition is strong, is proved by the curious way in which, for three generations, we have given up very different occupations in order to settle here; but I think that R.W.B. the parson, C.B. P.B. the social reformer and R.C.B. the archaeologist, would have done better work here if they had spent more {{of their lives in}} the North, and had a business training into the bargain …’,. [...] His later obituaries - he died in 1935 - focus chiefly on his character and on his pre- and post-Liverpool activities.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Explore the {{feasibility}} of integrating a dedicated pain centre information system {{as part of a}} quality management network with a number of different Hospital Information Systems. MATERIAL & METHODS: A systematic approach integrating and implementing the system in 15 selected <b>hospital</b> <b>organisations</b> (a nationwide 15 % non-random sample). RESULTS: Hospitals have widely varying policies on integration and implementation of additional clinically required 3 rd party software. Financial and organisational constraints are considerable. Partial data integration could be realised in one third of the <b>hospital</b> <b>organisations</b> within the project timeframe. Linking with various types of Hospital Information Systems from the same or different vendors caused no technical difficulties. The total effort required, however, varies considerably; different versions of a HIS of the same vendor require substantial additional effort. IT departments hardly use standard rules to accept this type of systems, causing substantial increases in completion time for installation. CONCLUSIONs: Although it is feasible to integrate a local departmental system as required (download of general patient, provider and referrer data basically, and also upload of certain data) the workload of scaling to the national level is considered far beyond what is reasonable for a national quality management network for pain. Alternatives for recording and capturing data (which comply with the requirements of the national system) are currently being explore...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} {{internal}} stratification in medicine suggest that non-White foreign-trained physicians fill the bottom {{level of the}} specialist hierarchy. However, {{in this study we}} use administrative registers for majority and non-Western physicians in Norway and find that non-Western physicians acquire spe-cialisation in the same volume as majority colleagues, are equally likely to enter several of the high prestige specialties and are not delayed in their careers. The equal distribution is discussed as a consequence of strong professional closure, bureaucratisation of hiring procedures and <b>hospital</b> <b>organisation</b> and governmental influence. Identified patterns, however, are not unequivocal. First, immigrant phys-icians have a significantly higher chance of becoming specialists compared to majority physicians. Second, foreign-educated non-Western physicians have a significantly lower likelihood of specialising in surgery fields. The exception from the overall equality may result from exclusionary practices previously identified in surgery, but it could also result from differences in motivation. </p...|$|E
40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{promoting}} the informed choice of pregnant women, staff and pregnant women at two urban hospitals were offered leaflets summarising the best available evidence {{about the effectiveness of}} routine ultrasonography in early pregnancy. Ultrasonographers doubted the credibility of the evidence and were concerned that the leaflets would raise women's anxiety, reduce uptake of scans, disrupt <b>hospital</b> <b>organisation,</b> and reinforce media messages about the poor safety record of ultrasonography. Midwives thought that the leaflets would inform women, help them to talk about their care with health professionals, and help them to get better care. Women were shocked at some of the contents but thought that it was appropriate to include both advantages and disadvantages of routine scanning in the leaflet. This case study highlights the resistance of some health professionals to evidence based health care; underlying conflicts with the principle of professional autonomy; concern that informed choice may create anxiety; and professional and organisational barriers to allowing informed choice...|$|E

An alert administrator will know that as a public service institution with limited resources at its disposal and where accountability and delegated responsibility come into play, a hospital has to be run like a business. Yet hospitals are vastly more complex than a typical business. Techniques and strategies that work in manufacturing and retailing, for example, may well prove inadequate in the hospital sector...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the {{success and failure}} of voluntary <b>hospital</b> <b>organisations</b> in Ireland during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The study draws on (and extends) Salamon’s theory of voluntary failure by examining the activities of religious organisations responsible for the ownership, management and delivery of acute hospital care. This theoretical perspective identifies a number of dimensions of organisational life for voluntary organisations, which precipitated the demise of organisations as voluntary sector entities, particularly issues of resource-dependency. This study shows that in the Irish hospital context many religiously owned voluntary hospitals have followed the predictable route to failure – culminating either in closure or transfer to public sector ownership, although some others have withstood the difficulties commonly encountered by voluntary organisations (VOs) as outlined by Salamon...|$|R

However, as more business processes become Internet based and high connection bandwidth becomes available at reasonable prices, systems such as ours will be present in day to day operation amongst a large number of the disparate operations of the UK National Health Service (NHS) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{aim of this}} {{exploratory}} research is to understand further how organisations can evaluate their activities, which generate knowledge creation, to meet changing stakeholder expectations. A Scale of Knowledge (SoK) Framework is proposed which links knowledge management and organisational activities to changing stakeholder expectations. The framework was informed by the knowledge management literature, as well as empirical work conducted via a single case study of a multi-site <b>hospital</b> <b>organisation</b> in Saudi Arabia. Eight in-depth semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} managers from across the organisation regarding current and future stakeholder expectations, organisational strategy/activities and knowledge management. Data were analysed using thematic analysis and a hierarchical value map technique to identify activities that can produce further knowledge and consequently impact on how stakeholder expectations are met. The SoK Framework developed may be useful to practitioners as an analytical aid to determine if current organisational activities produce organisational knowledge which helps them meet (increasingly higher levels of) stakeholder expectations. The limitations of the research and avenues for future development of the proposed framework are discussed.

40|$|Background: <b>Hospital</b> <b>organisations</b> {{based on}} the level of care inten-sity have clearly {{revealed}} a concept, that of care complexity, which has been widely used for decades in the healthcare field. Despite its wide use, this concept is still poorly defined and it is often confused with and replaced by similar concepts such as care intensity or workload. This study aims to describe the meaning of care complexity as per-ceived by nurses in their day-to-day experience of hospital clinical care, rehabilitation, home care, and organisation. Design and methods: Fifteen interviews were conducted with nurses belonging to clinical-care areas and to heterogeneous organisational areas. The interview was of an unstructured type. The participants were selected using a propositional methodology. Colaizzi’s descriptive phenomenological method was chosen for the analysis of the inter-views...|$|R
