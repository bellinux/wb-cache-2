5|$|The {{chronology}} {{of the tomb}} monument's completion is not precisely known, but portions can be determined from various sources. According to the passing reference of a <b>Florentine</b> notary, in 1424 (by the <b>Florentine</b> calendar) part of the tomb was installed. Michelozzo's Catasto from July 1427 indicates that Michelozzo had been Donatello's partner {{for about two years}} ("due anni o incircha") and that three-fourths of the 800florin budget had been spent. To harmonize these accounts, one must conclude either that Michelozzo's chronology was imprecise, that Donatello received the commission before the partnership was formed, or that the 1424 date in the <b>Florentine</b> calendar falls in 1425 in the modern calendar.|$|E

5|$|According to Avery, Donatello's Ascension of Christ and the Giving of the Keys to St. Peter {{may have}} been {{intended}} to share {{the front of the}} sarcophagus, further strengthening the papal associations, which were created by dating Cossa's death using the ancient Roman Calends of January, which was uncommon on <b>Florentine</b> tombs, but was used in papal ones.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the late 1380s and early 1390s, Isabeau {{demonstrated}} that she possessed diplomatic influence when the <b>Florentine</b> delegation requested her political intervention in the Gian Galeazzo Visconti affair. Orléans and the Duke of Burgundy were in the pro-Visconti faction while the anti-Visconti faction included Isabeau, her brother, Louis VII, Duke of Bavaria, and John III, Count of Armagnac. At that time Isabeau lacked the political power to effect change. Some years later, however, at the 1396 wedding of her seven-year-old daughter, Isabella, to Richard II of England (an event at which Charles attacked a herald for wearing Galeazzo's livery), Isabeau successfully negotiated an alliance between France and Florence with <b>Florentine</b> ambassador Buonaccorso Pitti.|$|E

The <b>Florentines</b> started to work in the Sistine Chapel in the Spring of 1481.|$|R

5|$|In his Cronica, Villani {{writes that}} the Guelph defeat by the Ghibellines at Montaperti in 1260 was a major setback to the {{historical}} progress of the Republic of Florence. In this civil war, the Guelphs were a faction united with the papacy in Rome, while the Ghibellines were allied with the descendants of Emperor Frederick II of the Holy Roman Empire and supported by Siena. According to Villani, the <b>Florentine</b> Guelphs' last stand was in defending the Carroccio, a chariot which symbolized {{the independence of the}} Commune of Florence. Villani estimated that 2,500 <b>Florentine</b> troops were killed and 1,500 captured during the battle, which Roberta J.M. Olson states are conservative numbers in regards to subsequent historians writing of the battle's casualties.|$|E
5|$|Lisa's <b>Florentine</b> {{family was}} old and aristocratic but over time had lost their influence.

5|$|On {{top of the}} sarcophagus, the bier of the effigy is {{supported}} by lions whose shape mimics Trecento consoles. The lions may {{be based on the}} <b>Florentine</b> , as if to mark John XXIII {{in the same manner as}} a conquered city-state. As Donatello's Marzocco for the papal apartment in Santa Maria Novella conveyed Florence's ambivalence towards Martin V (as both a source of prestige by visiting, and a potential adversary of the Republic), the lions supporting the bier contextualize the tomb monument's support for John XXIII's claim to the papacy by cementing it as a <b>Florentine</b> claim. Yet, any iconographical interpretation of the lions must be taken with a grain of salt as lions are symbolically promiscuous, and are also seen as supports on earlier tombs, such as that of Lapo de' Bardi (d.1342) in the Bargello.|$|E

5|$|Villani's Cronica was {{considered}} an important work at the time, valuable enough for his brother and nephew to continue it. Little is known of Villani's brother, Matteo, save that he was twice married, that he died of the plague in 1363, and that he continued work on the Cronica until his death. Filippo Villani, Matteo's son, flourished {{in the latter half}} of the 14th century and ended the Cronica at 1364; his portion includes details of the lives of many <b>Florentine</b> artists and musicians, including Giotto di Bondone and Francesco Landini. Filippo's chronicles were approved by the Chancellor of Florence, Coluccio Salutati, who made corrections to the work and added commentary. The 15th-century <b>Florentine</b> historian Domenico di Leonardo Buoninsegni also featured in the first two chapters of his Istoria Fiorentina a summary of Villani's Cronica.|$|E

According to Sigismondo de' Conti, papal secretary and chronicler, the vote was unanimous on the fourth ballot, taken early in the morning on 11 August although Borja had only 15 votes prior to the accessus; other accounts say Borja received all the votes except for his own, which he gave to Carafa.|$|E
5|$|Born out {{of wedlock}} to a notary, Piero da Vinci, and a peasant woman, Caterina, in Vinci {{in the region of}} Florence, Leonardo was educated in the studio of the renowned <b>Florentine</b> painter Andrea del Verrocchio.

He later worked in Rome, Bologna and Venice, and he spent his last years in France at the home awarded to him by Francis I of France.|$|E

After Alfonsina's death in 1520, Catherine joined her cousins and was raised by her aunt, Clarice Strozzi. The death of Pope Leo in 1521 briefly interrupted Medici power until Cardinal Giulio de' Medici was elected Pope Clement VII in 1523. Clement housed Catherine in the Palazzo Medici Riccardi in Florence, where she lived in state. The <b>Florentine</b> people called her duchessina ("the little duchess"), in deference to her unrecognised claim to the Duchy of Urbino.|$|E
40|$|The {{foreword}} is {{a literary}} comment to Brendan Kennelly's two novels {{contained in the}} volume: The Crooked Cross (1963) and The <b>Florentines</b> (1967). Kennelly draws extensively from classic and Irish epic and Joyce himself enters his work. In The Crooked Cross {{we can hear the}} echo of the classic Odyssey {{on the one hand and}} detect the prevailing mode of the tale of traditional Irish epic on the other. Emigration is an underlying theme in both novels though in The <b>Florentines</b> it is just temporarily experienced by the protagonist while coming of age. The <b>Florentines,</b> which represents an early and very original example of the campus novel tradition, belongs to the bildungsroman genre and its central theme is encounter: with England, English university life, English language...|$|R

5|$|In 1669, {{fears of}} an Ottoman attack rose {{after the fall}} of Candia, and the {{following}} year Grand Master Nicolas Cotoner invited Antonio Maurizio Valperga, the military engineer of the House of Savoy, to improve Malta's fortifications.

The <b>Florentine</b> knight Fra Giovanni Francesco Ricasoli donated 20,000 scudi to construct the fort, and it was named in his honour.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo Bruni was {{the first}} to use {{tripartite}} periodization in his History of the <b>Florentine</b> People (1442).
