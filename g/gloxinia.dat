2500|$|Lophospermum erubescens, {{known as}} Mexican twist or {{creeping}} <b>gloxinia,</b> is a climbing or sprawling herbaceous perennial, {{native to the}} Sierra Madre Oriental mountains of Mexico, where it is found along forest margins or canyon walls. It climbs by means of twining leaf stalks. Wild plants have [...] pink and white tubular flowers, although other colours are found in cultivation. It has been cultivated as an ornamental plant since at least 1830. Although not frost-hardy, it will survive if its base and roots are protected from freezing in the winter. It has escaped from cultivation and become naturalized in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, including Hawaii and eastern Australia.|$|E

I've to rout the gardeners out of the greenhouse, or I should never have a strawberry or a pink, but only nasty <b>gloxinias</b> and glaring fuchsias, and I've been giving lessons to dozens of people and writing charming sermons in the [...] "Bible of Amiens"; but I get so sleepy in the afternoon I can't pull myself over it.|$|R

Wright's {{painting}} is pleasant to look upon. I stand in a corner of my room, at father's old mahogany desk. Her picture and his, the large framed photographs from Richmond's drawing, and a good photograph of the Bishop are just above. I wish you could see my room. I write now on December 3, a bright summer day, but my room with its deep verandah is cool and shady. It is true that I refuse carpet and curtains. They only hold dust and make the room fusty. But the whole room is filled with books, and those pictures, and the Lionardo da Vinci over the fireplace, and Mr. Boxall's photograph over it, and his drawing vis-a-vis to it {{at the other end of}} the room, and by my window a splendid <b>gloxinia</b> with fine full flowers out in a very pretty porcelain pot, both Mr. Codrington's gift. On another glass stand (also his present) a Mota flower imported here, a brilliant scarlet hibiscus, and blossoms of my creepers and bignonia, most beautiful. So fresh and pretty. The steps of the verandah are a mass of honeysuckle. The stephanotis, with the beautiful scented white flowers and glossy leaves, covers one of the posts. How pleasant it is. Everyone is kind, all are well, all are going on well just now. Such are missionary comforts. Where the hardships are I have not yet discovered. Your chain, dear Joan, is round my neck, and the locket (Mamma's) in which you, Fan, put the hair of you five, hangs on it.|$|E
6000|$|In the peloric form of Antirrhinum majus, {{appropriately}} called the" [...] Wonder," [...] the tubular and elongated flowers differ wonderfully {{from those}} of the common snapdragon; the calyx and the mouth of the corolla consist of six equal lobes, and include six equal instead of four unequal stamens. One of the two additional stamens is manifestly formed by the development of a microscopically minute papilla, which may be found {{at the base of the}} upper lip of the flower of the common snapdragons in the nineteen plants examined by me. That this papilla is a rudiment of a stamen was well shown by its various degrees of development in crossed plants between the common and the peloric Antirrhinum. Again, a peloric Galeobdolon luteum, growing in my garden, had five equal petals, all striped like the ordinary lower lip, and included five equal instead of four unequal stamens; but Mr. R. Keeley, who sent me this plant, informs me that the flowers vary greatly, having from four to six lobes to the corolla, and from three to six stamens. (13/71. For other cases of six divisions in peloric flowers of the Labiatae and Scrophulariaceae see Moquin- Tandon 'Teratologie' page 192.) Now, as the members of the two great families to which the Antirrhinum and Galeobdolon belong are properly pentamerous, with some of the parts confluent and others suppressed, we ought not to look at the sixth stamen and the sixth lobe to the corolla in either case as due to reversion, any more than the additional petals in double flowers in these same two families. But the case is different with the fifth stamen in the peloric Antirrhinum, which is produced by the redevelopment of a rudiment always present, and which probably reveals to us the state of the flower, as far as the stamens are concerned, at some ancient epoch. It is also difficult to believe that the other four stamens and the petals, after an arrest of development at a very early embryonic age, would have come to full perfection in colour, structure, and function, unless these organs had at some former period normally passed through a similar course of growth. Hence it appears to me probable that the progenitor of the genus Antirrhinum must at some remote epoch have included five stamens and borne flowers in some degree resembling those now produced by the peloric form. The conclusion that peloria is not a mere monstrosity, irrespective of any former state of the species, is supported by the fact that this structure is often strongly inherited, as in the case of the peloric Antirrhinum and <b>Gloxinia</b> and sometimes in that of the peloric Corydalis solida. (13/72. Godron reprinted from the 'Memoires de l'Acad. de Stanislas' 1868.) ...|$|E
60|$|Great {{deviations}} of structure, {{even when the}} reproductive organs themselves are not seriously affected, sometimes cause plants to become sterile. But in other cases plants may become monstrous to an extreme degree and yet retain their full fertility. Gallesio, who certainly had great experience (18/90. 'Teoria della Riproduzione' 1816 page 84; 'Traite du Citrus' 1811 page 67.), often attributes sterility to this cause; {{but it may be}} suspected that in some of his cases sterility was the cause, and not the result, of the monstrous growths. The curious St. Valery apple, although it bears fruit, rarely produces seed. The wonderfully anomalous flowers of Begonia frigida, formerly described, though they appear fit for fructification, are sterile. (18/91. Mr. C.W. Crocker in 'Gardener's Chronicle' 1861 page 1092.) Species of Primula in which the calyx is brightly coloured are said (18/92. Verlot 'Des Varietes' 1865 page 80.) to be often sterile, though I have known them to be fertile. On the other hand, Verlot gives several cases of proliferous flowers which can be propagated by seed. This was the case with a poppy, which had become monopetalous by the union of its petals. (18/93. Verlot ibid page 88.) Another extraordinary poppy, with the stamens replaced by numerous small supplementary capsules, likewise reproduces itself by seed. This has also occurred with a plant of Saxifraga geum, in which a series of adventitious carpels, bearing ovules on their margins, had been developed between the stamens and the normal carpels (18/94. Prof. Allman, Brit. Assoc., quoted in the 'Phytologist' volume 2 page 483. Prof. Harvey, on the authority of Mr. Andrews, who discovered the plant, informed me that this monstrosity could be propagated by seed. With respect to the poppy see Prof. Goeppert as quoted in 'Journal of Horticulture' July 1, 1863 page 171.) Lastly, with respect to peloric flowers, which depart wonderfully from the natural structure,--those of Linaria vulgaris seem generally to be more or less sterile, whilst those before described of Antirrhinum majus, when artificially fertilised with their own pollen, are perfectly fertile, though sterile when left to themselves, for bees are unable to crawl into the narrow tubular flower. The peloric flowers of Corydalis solida, according to Godron (18/95. 'Comptes Rendus' December 19, 1864 page 1039.), are sometimes barren and sometimes fertile; whilst those of <b>Gloxinia</b> are well known to yield plenty of seed. In our greenhouse Pelargoniums, the central flower of the truss is often peloric, and Mr. Masters informs me that he tried in vain during several years to get seed from these flowers. I likewise made many vain attempts, but sometimes succeeded in fertilising them with pollen from a normal flower of another variety; and conversely I several times fertilised ordinary flowers with peloric pollen. Only once I succeeded in raising a plant from a peloric flower fertilised by pollen from a peloric flower borne by another variety; but the plant, it may be added, presented nothing particular in its structure. Hence we may conclude that no general rule can be laid down; but any great deviation from the normal structure, even when the reproductive organs themselves are not seriously affected, certainly often leads to sexual impotence.|$|E
50|$|Sinningia speciosa, {{commonly}} {{known in the}} horticultural trade as <b>Gloxinia,</b> is a tuberous member of the flowering plant family Gesneriaceae. The common name has persisted since its original introduction to cultivation from Brazil in 1817 as <b>Gloxinia</b> speciosa. The name florist's <b>gloxinia</b> is sometimes used to distinguish it from the rhizomatous species now included in the genus <b>Gloxinia.</b> Another common name is Brazilian <b>gloxinia.</b> The plants produce large, velvety, brightly colored flowers and are popular houseplants. Cultural requirements {{are similar to those}} of African violets except that S. speciosa generally requires more light and often has a dormant period, when the tuber should be kept cool and dry until it resprouts.|$|E
50|$|Seemannia {{was created}} in 1855 by Regel for the species Seemannia ternifolia (now {{considered}} a synonym of S. sylvatica). In 1976 Seemannia was synonymized under the genus <b>Gloxinia</b> by gesneriad specialist Hans Wiehler but has more recently been revived following phylogenetic and morphological research on relationships of <b>Gloxinia</b> and related genera, which suggested that Wiehler's generic concept of <b>Gloxinia</b> was overly broad and polyphyletic. Although now recognized as a separate genus, Seemannia {{is closely related to}} <b>Gloxinia</b> and hybrids between the two genera are fertile although the two genera are very distinct morphologically.|$|E
5000|$|Benjamin Peter Gloxin (1765-1794) was a German {{physician}} and botanical writer {{who lived in}} Colmar. He is commemorated by the Brazilian genus <b>Gloxinia</b> and Sinningia speciosa, which is commonly called <b>Gloxinia</b> in the horticulture trade.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gloxinia</b> perennis is the {{original}} (type) species of the genus and for much of its history the genus consisted of only G. perennis and {{a very small number}} of other species. However, most recent references on <b>Gloxinia</b> reflect the 1976 classification of Hans Wiehler, who took a broad view of the genus. A recent analysis of <b>Gloxinia</b> and related genera based on molecular and morphological work has determined that Wiehler's circumscription of the genus was unnatural, both phylogenetically and morphologically. The analyses demonstrated that the genera Anodiscus and Koellikeria, each with a single species, were more closely related to <b>Gloxinia</b> perennis than were any of the other species included in <b>Gloxinia</b> by Wiehler, several of which proved to be more closely related to other genera (particularly Diastema, Monopyle, and Phinaea). As a result of this work, most of the species have been transferred to other genera while Koellikeria erinoides and Anodiscus xanthophyllus have been transferred into a much more narrowly defined <b>Gloxinia</b> consisting of only three species, all of them characterized by having a raceme-like flowering stem. The other species have been transferred to the existing genus Monopyle, the resurrected genera Mandirola and Seemannia, and the new genera Gloxinella, Gloxiniopsis, Nomopyle, and Sphaerorrhiza. <b>Gloxinia</b> perennis forms fertile hybrids with species of Seemannia, which was the primary reason for uniting the two genera.|$|E
