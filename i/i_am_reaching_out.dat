5000|$|Tonight <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>out</b> {{to every}} single South African, black and white, from the very depths of my being. A white man, full of {{prejudice}} and hate, came to our country and committed a deed so foul that our whole nation now teeters {{on the brink of}} disaster. A white woman, of Afrikaner origin, risked her life so that we may know, and bring to justice, this assassin. The cold-blooded murder of Chris Hani has sent shock waves throughout the country and the world. ... Now is the time for all South Africans to stand together against those who, from any quarter, wish to destroy what Chris Hani gave his life for - the freedom of all of us.|$|E

40|$|Two years ago, I {{came to the}} States for MFA {{program in}} UCSD. At first, I started making {{instructions}} for performance to communicate with people in my clumsy English, but it soon became my general process of working. In this show, I present a room surrounded by five video projections and drawings. They are documentation of performances concerning the balance of relationship. I performed two with Josh Aaron, other two with Josh Tonies, and one by myself. The performance done by myself reveals the psychology underlying the other collaborative performances. By projecting it on the center wall, I wanted to turn the gallery into a psychological space. Also, this year, l worked with only two people who I had personal affection for. I expected the intimacy would push the work further {{to the realm of}} truth, even though it would still end up fiction. The invitation to the performance was the offering and the demanding at the same time. The more I work with the person, the easier to perform due to familiarity, but the harder to ask more commitment. Therefore, through my work and working, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> constantly <b>reaching</b> <b>out</b> to the other, measuring the fitness of my desire for the other...|$|R

500|$|Jay-Z {{opened his}} set at Glastonbury 2008 {{with a cover}} of Oasis' song [...] "Wonderwall". When Gallagher {{was asked about the}} {{incident}} he replied, [...] "The way it's played itself out <b>is</b> that <b>I</b> said Jay-Z had no right to play Glastonbury, which is a crock of horseshit. I got off a plane and someone asked me about the fact that Glastonbury hadn't sold {{out for the first time}} in years, and if it was because of Jay-Z. From there it grew into this crap that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> standing on an orange crate at Speakers' Corner saying, 'Gather round, brothers and sisters. Have you heard what's happening at Glastonbury this year?' I have a certain turn of phrase. So if I say, [...] "Chicken sandwiches in McDonald's are just plain fucking wrong," [...] it doesn't mean I'm attacking all chickens or all sandwiches. I've hung out with Jay-Z in Tokyo. I've seen his show. It's not my bag, but it's all right. We have a mutual friend in Chris Martin. So <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a guy who doesn't like hip-hop—shock, horror. I don't dislike rappers or hip-hop or people who like it. I went to the Def Jam tour in Manchester in the '80s when rap was inspirational. Public Enemy were awesome. But it's all about status and bling now, and it doesn't say anything to me." [...] When Jay-Z was asked about Gallagher's comments he said [...] "I haven't spoken to him , <b>I</b> heard he <b>was</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>out.</b> <b>I</b> don't bear any grudge, it's all good. I just believe in good music and bad music, I've always said that. You look at any interview from the beginning of time, I've always stated that I don't believe in the lines and classifications that people put music in so they can easily define it". When asked who he would be interested in collaborating with in the future, the rapper said, [...] "Anyone. Oasis as well – it doesn't matter to me." ...|$|R
