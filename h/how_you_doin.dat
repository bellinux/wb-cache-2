40|$|International audienceSHOULD {{can have}} two {{seemingly}} opposite epistemic values, {{depending on whether}} it occurs in a conditional clause or in a main clause: Labour should win the election. If Labour should win the election, what would <b>you</b> <b>do?In</b> the first example, SHOULD expresses both likelihood and the positive expectation of a Labour victory; conversely, in the second example SHOULD carries both a sense of unlikelihood and the negative apprehension of a Labour victory. I propose to account for this semantic alternation by a two-pronged approach: on the one hand, SHOULD will be analyzed as a marker that expresses the speaker’s point of view by qualifying the event as epistemically (un) expected and/or subjectively (un) desirable. On the other hand, IF-conditional clauses will be analyzed as suspending the speaker’s endorsement. The {{combination of the two}} results in the primary value of SHOULD being reversed...|$|R
