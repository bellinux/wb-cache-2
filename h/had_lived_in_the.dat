5|$|According to the Council of Trent, every Catholic {{church is}} {{required}} to have a residing pastor. Before {{the building of the}} rectory began in 1944, the three priests and their housekeeper <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Leslie Mansion (the mansion on the property). The mansion was over a hundred years old, was a frame building, had very few rooms, provided poor living conditions, and had a water pump at the main entrance.|$|E
5|$|Although Clinch {{believed}} that the evidence pointed to the twins having genuinely existed but that they <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 16th century, rather than the early 12th century as generally claimed, they are not mentioned in any journals or books from the period. This points against their having lived in the 16th century; the case of Lazarus and Joannes Baptista Colloredo (1617– after1646) had prompted great interest in conjoined twins, and conjoined sisters surviving to adulthood in south east England would have been widely noted.|$|E

5|$|During {{the reign}} of Stephen II of Hungary, Ladislaus's shrine in the cathedral of Várad became a {{preferred}} venue for trials by ordeal. However, it cannot be determined whether Ladislaus became subject to veneration soon after his death, or if his cult emerged after he was canonized by Béla III of Hungary on 27 June 1192. Béla <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine court, where Ladislaus's daughter, Irene, was venerated as a saint.|$|E
5|$|First {{elected to}} Congress in 1936, Voorhis had {{defeated}} lackluster Republican opposition {{four times in}} the then-rural Los Angeles County district to win re-election. For the 1946 election, Republicans sought a candidate who could unite the party and run a strong race against Voorhis in the Republican-leaning district. After failing to secure the candidacy of General George Patton, in November 1945 they settled on Lieutenant Commander Richard Nixon, who <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> district prior to his World War II service.|$|E

5|$|Longyearbyen {{experiences}} {{a very high}} turnover; in 2008, 427 people (23 percent) {{moved away from the}} town. The average person lived in Longyearbyen for 6.3 years, although it is 6.6 years for Norwegians and 4.3 years for foreigners. In 2009, {{about a quarter of the}} population <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town since before 2000, and can thus be regarded as permanent population. The longest residing people tend to work in the mining industry, followed by local government employees. The shortest tenures are held by students and employees in higher education, tourism and the state.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all {{structures}} {{within an}} 800-metre (half-mile) radius, including {{the entire community}} of Richmond, were obliterated. A pressure wave snapped trees, bent iron rails, demolished buildings, grounded vessels, and scattered fragments of Mont-Blanc for kilometres. Hardly a window in the city proper survived the blast. Across the harbour, in Dartmouth, there was also widespread damage. A tsunami created by the blast wiped out the community of Mi'kmaq First Nations people who <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tufts Cove area for generations.|$|E
5|$|The {{death in}} 1986 of {{her younger sister}} Felicité, who <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> top floor of her house for thirty years, was a severe blow to David.

After a torrid time over a three-month stay in hospital, where the drugs she was prescribed had side-effects that affected her clarity of thinking, her friend, the wine importer and writer Gerald Asher, arranged for her to stay with him in California to recuperate.|$|E

5|$|Bojić's matrilineal line traces {{its origins}} {{to the town}} of Tetovo, in what is now {{northern}} Macedonia. His mother's family had fled the town in 1690 as part of the Great Serb Migration and settled in Bečkerek (modern Zrenjanin). Bojić's maternal grandfather, Jovan, <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> border town of Pančevo since he was a child, married and started a family there. Much like Bojić's father, he was a successful shoemaker, and in 1890 he offered to marry his only daughter to him. After initial disagreement over the price of the dowry, Bogojević gave the marriage his blessing and Bojić's parents were soon married.|$|E
5|$|By 1876 Gilbert had {{qualified}} {{to play for}} Gloucestershire, as he <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> county {{for the length of}} time required by the rules. In his first season for the club he finished fifth in the first-class batting averages, scoring 907 runs at an average of 36.28. His highest score was 205 not out for an England XI against Cambridge University, the third-highest score of the season after W. G. Grace's two triple centuries. His innings lasted about seven hours, and he batted on each of the three days of the match. This was his maiden first-class century; he scored another hundred later in the season when he made 143 runs for a combined Kent and Gloucestershire side against a team representing England. In the same season he took 28 wickets at an average of 19.64, including seven wickets for 65 runs in the match between the United South of England XI and the United North of England XI.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{disbanding}} of the camps, {{the defeated}} {{forces of the}} former regime continued a cross-border insurgency campaign into Rwanda from North Kivu. The insurgents maintained a presence in Rwanda's north western provinces and were supported by the predominantly Hutu population, many of whom <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> refugee camps before they were attacked. In addition to supporting the wars in the Congo, Kagame began a propaganda campaign to bring the Hutu to his side. He integrated former soldiers of the deposed genocidal regime's military into the RPF-dominated national army and appointed senior Hutu to key local government positions in the areas hit by insurgency. These tactics were eventually successful; by 1999, {{the population in the}} north west had stopped supporting the insurgency and the insurgents were mostly defeated.|$|E

5|$|Ferb was {{originally}} {{going to be}} voiced by actor Mitchel Musso. However, when Phineas and Ferb was picked up as a full series, Povenmire and Marsh chose to make Ferb British and cast Thomas Sangster as his voice. However, they enjoyed Musso to a level that they recast him {{as the voice of}} the character Jeremy Johnson; although Musso no longer voices a title character, his new role allows him more lines. Sangster himself is a British actor and was among several cast members hired that hailed from England. Marsh himself <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country for seven years and developed a fondness for the culture and people.|$|E
5|$|John Williamson was {{released}} early, in 1955, and deported to England, although he <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States {{since the age}} of ten. Irving Potash moved to Poland after his release from prison, then re-entered the United States illegally in 1957, and was arrested and sentenced to two years for violating immigration laws. Robert G. Thompson skipped bail, was captured in 1953, and sentenced to an additional four years. He died in 1965 and U.S. Army officials refused him burial in Arlington National Cemetery. His wife challenged that decision, first losing in U.S. District Court and then winning in the Court of Appeals. Defense attorney George W. Crockett Jr. later became a Democratic congressman from Michigan.|$|E
5|$|Kubrick {{married his}} high-school {{sweetheart}} Toba Metz, a keen caricaturist, on May 29, 1948, {{when he was}} nineteen years of age. They had attended Taft High School together and <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same apartment block on Shakespeare Avenue. The couple lived together in Greenwich Village and divorced three years later in 1951. He met his second wife, the Austrian-born dancer and theatrical designer Ruth Sobotka, in 1952. They lived together in New York's East Village beginning in 1952, got married in January 1955 and moved to Hollywood in July 1955, where she played a brief part as a ballet dancer in Kubrick's film, Killer's Kiss (1955). The following year she was art director for his film, The Killing (1956). They divorced in 1957. Kubrick lived with dancer and actress Valda Setterfield after the marriage broke down.|$|E

5|$|Montacute House {{was built}} in about 1598 by Sir Edward Phelips, whose family <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Montacute area since at least 1460, first as yeomen farmers before rising in status. The site was bought from the Cluniac Montacute Priory by Thomas Phelips and passed to his grandson, also called Thomas, who started {{planning}} the house, but died before it was built and left {{the completion of the}} work to his son Edward. Edward Phelips was a lawyer who had been in Parliament since 1584. He was knighted in 1603 and a year later became Speaker of the House. James I appointed him Master of the Rolls and Chancellor to his son and heir Henry, Prince of Wales. Phelips remained at the hub of English political life, and his legal skills were employed when he became opening prosecutor during the trial of the Gunpowder Plotters.|$|E
5|$|On 18 June 2005, to {{celebrate}} the 750th anniversary of Kaliningrad, {{a monument to the}} Baron was unveiled as a gift from Bodenwerder, portraying the Baron's cannonball ride. Bodenwerder sports a Munchausen monument in front of its Town Hall, as well a Munchausen museum including a large collection of illustrated editions of the stories. Another Munchausen Museum (Minhauzena Muzejs) exists in Duntes Muiža, Latvia, home of the real Baron's first wife; the couple <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town for six years, before moving back to the baronial estate in Hanover. In 2005, to mark the real-life Baron's 285th birthday, the National Bank of Latvia issued a commemorative silver coin.|$|E
5|$|Savage {{was born}} in Utica, New York, the son of Jane Moorhead Ewart and Richard Savage (1817–1903), a lawyer and {{manufacturer}} whose family <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Utica area for years. The 1848 finding of gold in California, prompted Savage's father to join the California Gold Rush in 1850. Savage {{and the rest of}} his family left New York in 1851 to join his father. They arrived in San Francisco in February 1852. Savage was among the first boys to attend public school in the new city, along with future poet Charles Warren Stoddard and the brothers Gus, Charles and Harry de Young who would found the San Francisco Chronicle. While the younger Savage was in school, his father helped discover the rich silver deposits of the Comstock Lode.|$|E
