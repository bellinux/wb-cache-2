40|$|Abstract—Temperature-dependent {{minority}} electron mo-bilities in p-type SiGe {{have been}} measured {{for the first}} time. Measurements were made on test npn SiGe/Si heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBT’s) with pseudomorphic p-type Si 1 Ge (0 2 0 4) base layers. Magnetotransport measurements were performed on the fabricated HBT’s to obtain the minority <b>electron</b> <b>mobilities</b> in the heavily B-doped base layers for temper-atures ranging from 5 to 300 K. The measured minority <b>electron</b> <b>mobilities</b> exhibited sharp increase with decreasing temperature, and also showed enhancement with decreasing base Ge com-position. The cut-off frequency technique was also employed to estimate the room temperature minority <b>electron</b> <b>mobilities</b> of the alloys and the results confirmed the trend in mobilities with Ge composition {{as determined by the}} magnetotransport technique.

25|$|The {{distinction}} between semiconductors and insulators {{is a matter}} of convention. One approach is to think of semiconductors as a type of insulator with a narrow band gap. Insulators with a larger band gap, usually greater than 4 eV, are not considered semiconductors and generally do not exhibit semiconductive behaviour under practical conditions. <b>Electron</b> <b>mobility</b> also plays a role in determining a material's informal classification.|$|E
25|$|A polaron is a {{quasiparticle}} used in {{condensed matter physics}} {{to understand}} the interactions between electrons and atoms in a solid material. The polaron concept was first proposed by Lev Landau in 1933 to describe an electron moving in a dielectric crystal where the atoms move from their equilibrium positions to effectively screen the charge of an electron, known as a phonon cloud. This lowers the <b>electron</b> <b>mobility</b> and increases the electron's effective mass.|$|E
25|$|Lower {{transconductance}}: The transconductance of the MOSFET decides its {{gain and}} {{is proportional to}} hole or <b>electron</b> <b>mobility</b> (depending on device type), at least for low drain voltages. As MOSFET size is reduced, the fields in the channel increase and the dopant impurity levels increase. Both changes reduce the carrier mobility, and hence the transconductance. As channel lengths are reduced without proportional reduction in drain voltage, raising the electric field in the channel, the result is velocity saturation of the carriers, limiting the current and the transconductance.|$|E

25|$|Alternatively, {{carbon-based}} compounds like graphene {{have also}} been proposed. First identified in the nineteenth century, an easy method of producing graphene was not available until 2004. Being a particular form of carbon, graphene typically exists in its stable form of graphite, a widely used material in many applications – the lead in a mechanical pencil being an example. When a single monolayer of carbon atoms is extracted from nonconductive bulk graphite, electrical properties are observed contributing to semiconductor behavior, making it a viable substitute for silicon. More research {{will need to be}} performed, however, on sub 50nm graphene layers, as its resistivity value increases and thus <b>electron</b> <b>mobility</b> decreases.|$|E

CdTe can operate at room temperature allowing the construction of compact detectors {{for a wide variety of}} applications in nuclear spectroscopy. The properties that make CdTe superior for the realization of high performance gamma- and x-ray detectors are high atomic number, large bandgap and high <b>electron</b> <b>mobility</b> ~1100cm2/V·s, which result in high intrinsic μτ (mobility-lifetime) product and therefore high degree of charge collection and excellent spectral resolution. Due to the poor charge transport properties of holes, ~100cm2/V·s, single-carrier-sensing detector geometries are used to produce high resolution spectroscopy; these include coplanar grids, frish-collar detectors and small pixel detectors.|$|E

It is a natural, three-dimensional counterpart to graphene with similar <b>electron</b> <b>mobility</b> and velocity. Graphene and topological insulators (such as those in 3DTDS) are both crystalline materials that are electrically insulating inside but conducting on the surface, allowing them to function as transistors and other electronic devices.

500|$|The {{properties}} of synthetic diamond {{depend on the}} details of the manufacturing processes; however, some synthetic diamonds (whether formed by HPHT or CVD) have properties such as hardness, thermal conductivity and <b>electron</b> <b>mobility</b> that are superior to those of most naturally formed diamonds. Synthetic diamond is widely used in abrasives, in cutting and polishing tools and in heat sinks. Electronic applications of synthetic diamond are being developed, including high-power switches at power stations, high-frequency field-effect transistors and light-emitting diodes. Synthetic diamond detectors of ultraviolet (UV) light or high-energy particles are used at high-energy research facilities and are available commercially. Because of its unique combination of thermal and chemical stability, low thermal expansion and high optical transparency in a wide spectral range, synthetic diamond is becoming the most popular material for optical windows in high-power CO2 lasers and gyrotrons. [...] It is estimated that 98% of industrial grade diamond demand is supplied with synthetic diamonds.|$|E

An exception is in radio-frequency engineering, particularly at VHF and higher frequencies where silver plating improves electrical conductivity because those currents tend to flow on the surface of conductors rather than through the interior. During World War II in the US, [...] tons of silver were used in electromagnets for enriching uranium, mainly because of the wartime shortage of copper. Pure silver has the highest thermal conductivity of any metal, although the conductivity of carbon (in the diamond allotrope) and superfluid helium-4 are even higher. Silver also has the lowest contact resistance of any metal.|$|E

[...] From the earliest research on radioactivity, radiation had been measured in terms of Ionisation, but existing Ionisation chambers were slow to respond to changes. [...] To address this problem, Rossi and Staub carried out a careful analysis of the pulses that result when individual charged particles create ions within an ionisation chamber. [...] They realised that the high mobility of free electrons removed from ionised atoms means that the pulses produced by single particles can be very brief. [...] With James S. Allen, Rossi found gas mixtures of high <b>electron</b> <b>mobility</b> and low electron attachment. [...] On the basis of these investigations, Allen and Rossi invented the [...] "fast ionisation chamber", which they patented after the war.

40|$|Poly(p-phenylene vinylene) {{derivatives}} (PPVs) {{are one of}} {{the most}} widely investigated p-type polymers in organic electronics. PPVs generally exhibit <b>electron</b> <b>mobilities</b> lower than 10 - 4 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1, thus hindering their applications in high-performance polymer field-effect transistors and organic photovoltaics.

This new PPV derivative displays high <b>electron</b> <b>mobilities</b> up to 1. 1 cm 2 V- 1 s- 1 under ambient conditions (4 orders of magnitude higher than those of other PPVs), because it overcomes common defects in PPVs, such as conformational disorder, weak interchain interaction, and a high LUMO level.

In the case of Al{sub x}Ga{sub 1 -x}N alloys, the reduction in the electron concentration due to the upward shift of the conduction band relative to the native defect level can account for the experimentally measured mobilities.

The electron phonon interaction that forms Cooper pairs in low-Tc superconductors [...] (type-I superconductors) can also be modeled as a polaron, and two opposite spin electrons may form a bipolaron sharing a phonon cloud.

2500|$|NPN {{is one of}} the {{two types}} of bipolar transistors, {{consisting}} of a layer of P-doped semiconductor (the [...] "base") between two N-doped layers. A small current entering the base is amplified to produce a large collector and emitter current.

In this [...] "on" [...] state, current flows from the collector to the emitter of the transistor. Most of the current is carried by electrons moving from emitter to collector as minority carriers in the P-type base region.
