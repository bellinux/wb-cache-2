500|$|Mutual {{also began}} {{building}} {{a reputation as}} a strong news service, rivaling the industry leaders in quality if not budget. The broadcasts of WOR reporter Gabriel Heatter from the Lindbergh kidnapping [...] "trial of the century" [...] in 1935, heard over Mutual, were highly regarded; Heatter soon had his own regularly scheduled newscast, aired nationally five nights a week. In 1936, also via WOR, Mutual began broadcasting the reports of news commentator Raymond Gram Swing, who became one of the country's leading voices on foreign affairs. In November 1937, conservative commentator Fulton Lewis Jr., heard five nights weekly from Mutual affiliate WOL, became the first national news personality to broadcast out of Washington, D.C.; he would remain with the network until his death almost three decades later. In 1938, Mutual started rebroadcasting news reports from the BBC and English-language newscasts from the <b>European</b> <b>mainland.</b> The <b>network</b> also began employing its own reporters in Europe as the continent headed toward crisis, including John Steele, Waverly Root, Arthur Mann, and Victor Lusinchi. Among these was Sigrid Schultz, the first accomplished female foreign correspondent to appear on American news radio.|$|R
40|$|The Interconnector {{pipeline}} {{links the}} UK and <b>mainland</b> <b>European</b> gas <b>networks.</b> This paper studies {{the history of}} the Interconnector from initial conception through to present day operation and contrasts the impact of the pipeline with expectations. The speculative nature and multi-partner approach of the project led to unique financial, project management and political challenges. The original investors in the Interconnector link had quite different ambitions and a corresponding variety of expectations. Operational experience has demonstrated Interconnector flows to be lower and more variable than expected by most stakeholders, reflecting the pipeline’s primary role as a trading line rather than a bulk transportation facility. This paper was originally written during early 2005 and reflects knowledge at that point in time...|$|R
