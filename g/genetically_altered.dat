5|$|Grizzly Rage {{breaks the}} {{standard}} mold for many Syfy natural horror films {{in that the}} bear featured is a normal grizzly bear rather than a mutant or <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> animal. However, the bear and actors never appear {{together in the same}} frame, rather a man in a bear suit takes over the role when the actors must interact with the bear. Critics heavily panned the film, feeling its plot, script, characters, and special effects were substandard.|$|E
5|$|Maneater {{is one of}} the few {{films in}} the series to break the {{standard}} formula of Syfy natural horror films with its use of a normal, living tiger rather than a CG animal or excusing its behavior by having it be a mutant or <b>genetically</b> <b>altered.</b> Critics heavily panned the film citing substandard acting, heavy use of stereotypical characters, a hole-filled plot, unused subplots, and the use of a live tiger resulting in almost all attacks being implied rather than seen.|$|E
5|$|While Osborn {{lies in the}} morgue, it is {{revealed}} that the goblin formula gave him a previously-unknown healing factor which restores him to life; {{in the process of}} sneaking out, he kills someone with a similar physique to himself to feign his death. No longer suffering from bouts of amnesia, Norman escapes to Europe, where he can move freely and unnoticed. During this time abroad, believed dead by the general public, he orchestrates several plots, including replacing Aunt May with a <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> actress, and faking his own son's death.|$|E

50|$|By {{being able}} to <b>genetically</b> <b>alter</b> plants to create {{specific}} antibodies, {{it is easier to}} produce antibodies that will fight diseases not only for humans but for plants as well. For that reason, plantibody applications will move more towards the medicinal field.|$|R
5|$|Animaniacs {{had a large}} cast of characters, {{separated}} into individual segments, with each pair or set of characters acting in its own plot. The Warners, Yakko, Wakko, and Dot, were three cartoon stars from the 1930s that were locked away in the Warner Bros. water tower until the 1990s, when they escaped. After their escape, they often interacted with Warner Bros. studio workers, including Ralph the Security Guard; Dr. Otto Scratchansniff, the studio psychiatrist, and his assistant Hello Nurse. Pinky and the Brain are two <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> laboratory mice who continuously plot and attempt {{to take over the}} world. Slappy Squirrel is an octogenarian cartoon star who can easily outwit antagonists and uses her wiles to educate her nephew, Skippy Squirrel, about cartoon techniques. Additional principal characters included Rita and Runt, Buttons and Mindy, Chicken Boo, Flavio and Marita (The Hip Hippos), Katie Ka-Boom, and a trio of pigeons known as The Goodfeathers.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass {{decides to}} use Roney's optic-encephalogram, {{a device that}} records {{impressions}} from the optical centres of the brain, and see the visions for himself. Roney's assistant, Barbara Judd, is most sensitive; placing the device on her, they record a violent purge of the Martian hive to root out unwanted mutations. Quatermass concludes that in its most primitive phase mankind was visited by this race of Martians. Some apes and primitive pre-humans were taken away and <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> to give them abilities such as telepathy, telekinesis and other psychic powers. They were then returned to Earth, and the buried artefact {{is one of the}} ships that had crashed {{at the end of its}} journey. With their home world dying, the aliens had tried to change humanity's ancestors to have minds and abilities similar to their own, but with a bodily form adapted to life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|The Amazing Spider-Man is a 2012 American superhero film {{based on}} the Marvel Comics {{character}} Spider-Man, and sharing {{the title of the}} character's longest-running comic book. It is the fourth theatrical Spider-Man film produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Entertainment, and a reboot of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2002-2007 trilogy preceding it. The film was directed by Marc Webb. It was written by James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves and it stars Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, Rhys Ifans as Dr. Curtis Connors, Denis Leary as NYPD Captain George Stacy, along with Martin Sheen and Sally Field as the uncle and aunt of Peter Parker, Ben Parker and May Parker. The film tells the story of Peter Parker, a teenager from New York who becomes Spider-Man after being bitten by a <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> spider. Parker must stop Dr. Curt Connors as a mutated lizard, from spreading a mutation serum to the city's human population.|$|E
50|$|Marcus Chalfen is a Jewish genetic {{engineer}} and husband of Joyce Chalfen.

Marcus loses interest in mentoring Irie when he begins corresponding with Magid.|$|R
50|$|Various {{animal and}} insect {{models have been}} used to explore sexual {{orientation}} and brain characteristics. One experiment involved <b>genetically</b> <b>altering</b> male Drosophila causing them to have feminized brain structures involved in processing sexually dimorphic contact pheromones. Transformed males showed increase homosexual courtship behaviors to wild-type male flies, and there a correlation was found between the courtship behavior and the expression of the altered gene in the sexually related brain regions.|$|R
50|$|Martha is remanded to a {{psychiatric}} hospital, where she discovers that experiments are being secretly performed on children to <b>genetically</b> <b>alter</b> their minds, effectively {{turning them into}} human computers. National budget cuts eventually cause the hospital to shut down, leaving Martha homeless. Medical workers dispatched to round up the patients try to subdue Martha, but she kills one and takes his wallet. She is able to steal money from an ATM using his account card.|$|R

50|$|In the institution, she {{discovers that}} {{experiments}} are being secretly performed on children to <b>genetically</b> <b>alter</b> their minds, effectively {{turning them into}} human computers. Their heads are covered with wires plugged into their brains. Martha believes one of them resembles the Raggedy Ann doll she played with as a child. This institution is closed due to national budget cuts, and Martha is left homeless. She later joins the PAX Peace Force, where her heroic tale begins. She fights in many battles during the second American Civil War.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the battle}} with the House of M, the Scarlet Witch changed back reality, <b>genetically</b> <b>altering</b> over {{ninety percent of the}} world's mutant {{population}} and only leaving a few hundred with their powers as a result, Toad among them. After rescuing Lorelei from anti-mutant thugs in Mutant Town, Toad escorted her to the Xavier Institute, where the X-Men had set up a camp for refugee mutants. Once he arrived at the institute he was paired with Fever Pitch as his tent mate, and made his disgust of the Sentinels [...] "watching" [...] them well known.|$|R
50|$|Another {{facet of}} abductee testimonial, which {{provides}} motive for alien visitation, {{is the use}} of experimentation. In nearly all alien supposed abductee experiences, the abductee recalls being examined upon. Reportedly, the examinations are generally centered around the human sex organs, while focus is also put on the cranium and skin. This experimentation process leads some to believe that the motive for extraterrestrial visitation is to use human body functions to either: 1) save their own race 2) help our race to survive or 3) <b>genetically</b> <b>alter</b> the human gene pool in order to serve their own purposes.|$|R
25|$|Cancer occurs after {{cells are}} <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> to proliferate rapidly and indefinitely. This {{uncontrolled}} proliferation by mitosis produces a primary heterogeneic tumour. The cells which constitute the tumor eventually undergo metaplasia, followed by anaplasia then dysplasia, {{resulting in a}} malignant phenotype. This malignancy allows for invasion into the circulation, followed by invasion to a second site for tumorigenesis.|$|E
25|$|Radiation Pathology is {{study of}} the {{interaction}} between human tissues and radiation, as long as the problems and diseases that can arise from the use of radiation. When human tissue is exposed to radiation, it can be <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> and deformed; in turn, this could lead to a variety of illnesses that could be minor or deadly.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of biopesticides - {{biochemical}} and microbial. Biochemical pesticides are similar to naturally occurring chemicals and are nontoxic, such as insect pheromones used to locate mates, while microbial biopesticides like Green Muscle come from bacteria, fungi, algae or viruses that either occur naturally or are <b>genetically</b> <b>altered.</b> Entomopathogenic fungi generally suppress pests by mycosis: causing a disease that is specific to the insect.|$|E

40|$|The recent {{generation}} of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from adult {{human somatic cells}} has intensified interest in cellular therapies for treating human disease. This issue's Molecular Medicine Select highlights progress in overcoming barriers {{to the use of}} transplanted cells. These achievements include the treatment of sickle cell anemia in mice using genetically repaired iPS cells, the creation of iPS cells that are less prone to cause cancer, and the transplantation of genetically modified skeletal muscle cells to prevent arrhythmia following heart attack in mice.

50|$|Aside {{from the}} action-ridden plot of Carson and DeVaca, the novel {{highlights}} political and scientific {{battle between the}} CEO of GeneDyne, Brent Scopes, and his former best friend, Charles Levine, over the ethics of genetic modification. Scopes argues that genetic modification, such as that involved {{in the creation of}} PurBlood, will one day lead to a healthier human race. Levine counters that the extent of the dangers of genetically modified products is unknown, and that humans should proceed with caution in <b>genetically</b> <b>altering</b> or engineering products that could change the biological make-up of humanity. In the end, Scopes and Levine are exposed to the mutated influenza virus X-FLU and resolve their differences before dying.|$|R
25|$|In 2006, an unsanctioned McDonald's Videogame was {{released}} online. It is {{parody of the}} business practices of the corporate giant, taking {{the guise of a}} tycoon style business simulation game. In the game, the player plays the role of a McDonald's CEO, choosing whether or not to use controversial practices like <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> cow feed, plowing over rainforests, and corrupting public officials. McDonald's issued a statement distancing itself from the game.|$|E
25|$|From this knowledge, ES cell {{contributions}} to chimeras have been developed. ES cells {{can be used}} in combination with eight-cell-and two-cell-stage embryos to make chimeras and exclusively give rise to the embryo proper. Embryos that are to be used in chimeras can further be <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> in order to specifically contribute to only one part of chimera. An example is the chimera built off of ES cells and tetraploid embryos, tetraploid embryos which are artificially made by electrofusion of two two-cell diploid embryos. The tetraploid embryo will exclusively give rise to the trophectoderm and primitive endoderm in the chimera.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{method of}} obtaining new deoxyribozymes is through in vitro {{evolution}}. Though this term is often used interchangeably with in vitro selection, in vitro evolution more appropriately refers to a slightly different procedure in which the initial oligonucleotide pool is <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> over subsequent rounds through genetic recombination or through point mutations. For point mutations, the pool can be amplified using error-prone PCR to produce many different strands of various random, single mutations. As with in vitro selection, the evolved strands with increased activity will tend to dominate the pool after multiple selection steps, and once a sufficient catalytic activity is reached, the pool can be sequenced to identify the most active strands.|$|E

25|$|The US and Western Europe have strict {{codes of}} ethics and {{regulations}} in place that expressly forbid certain subsets of experimentation using human cells, {{though there is a}} vast difference in the regulatory framework. Through the creation of human-chimera comes the question: where does society now draw the line of humanity? This question poses serious legal and moral issues, along with creating controversy. Chimpanzees, for example, are not offered any legal standing, and are put down if they pose a threat to humans. If a chimpanzee is <b>genetically</b> <b>altered</b> to be more similar to a human, it may blur the ethical line between animal and man. Legal debate would be {{the next step in the}} process to determine whether certain chimera should be granted legal rights. Along with issues regarding the rights of chimera, individuals have expressed concern whether or not creating human-chimera diminishes the dignity of being human.|$|E
25|$|The {{parallel}} storyline involves Akyta Dryad and {{an ensemble}} of surviving Enkie resistance fighters unleashing {{a series of}} guerrilla attacks on the empire, bent on stopping the Project. Most of the locations are visited after Ronotra Koss' exploits, featuring a much more ruined look and stronger resistance by Empire forces. Resistance fighters fall one after another, either captured or killed in action, dealing a series of crippling blows to the Layil who, however, seemingly recover from each with minimal actual consequences save for structure damage. Infiltrating Siriad, the Empire's floating fortress-city, Akyta, then the sole survivor, reaches the main chamber housing the Project apparatus; there, she is horrified to find two million Enkie survivors connected to machinery, heavily drugged and <b>genetically</b> <b>altered,</b> their natural time manipulating capabilities being channeled to fuel the Empire's temporal gravitation weapons.

40|$|Biogenic amines, such as {{serotonin}} and dopamine, can {{be important}} in reinforcing associative learning. This function is evident as changes in memory performance with manipulation of either of these signals. In the insects, evidence begins to argue for a common role of dopamine in negatively reinforced memory. In contrast, {{the role of the}} serotonergic system in reinforcing insect associative learning is either unclear or controversial. We investigated the role of both of these signals in operant place learning in Drosophila. By <b>genetically</b> <b>altering</b> serotonin and dopamine levels, manipulating the neurons that make serotonin and dopamine, and pharmacological treatments we provide clear evidence that serotonin, but not dopamine, is necessary for place memory. Thus, serotonin can be critical for memory formation in an insect, and dopamine is not a universal negatively reinforcing signal...|$|R
