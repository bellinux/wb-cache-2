50|$|In <b>digital</b> <b>signal</b> processing, a <b>digital</b> <b>signal</b> is a {{representation}} of a physical signal that is a sampled and quantified. A <b>digital</b> <b>signal</b> is an abstraction which is discrete in time and amplitude. The signal's value only exists at regular time intervals, since only {{the values of the}} corresponding physical signal at those sampled moments are significant for further digital processing. The <b>digital</b> <b>signal</b> is a sequence of codes drawn from a finite set of values. The <b>digital</b> <b>signal</b> may be stored, processed or transmitted physically as a pulse code modulation (PCM) signal.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, since FPD-Link mainly uses {{electrical}} <b>digital</b> <b>signaling</b> between zero volts (the ground level) and 1.2 volts {{based on}} its standard, it became a significant constraint of designing higher density LSIs. Under such circumstances, many substitutable interfaces such as DVI, HDMI, DisplayPort, and V-by-One HS are offered and adopted widely.|$|E
5000|$|After 2G was launched, the {{previous}} mobile telephone systems were retroactively dubbed 1G. While radio signals on 1G networks are analog, radio signals on 2G networks are digital.

50|$|V-by-One HS is an {{electrical}} <b>digital</b> <b>signaling</b> standard that can run at faster speeds over inexpensive twisted-pair copper cables than Low-voltage differential signaling, or LVDS.

50|$|Although {{both systems}} use <b>digital</b> <b>signaling</b> {{to connect the}} radio towers (which listen to the handsets) {{to the rest of}} the {{telephone}} system, the voice itself during a call is encoded to digital signals in 2G whereas 1G is only modulated to higher frequency, typically 150 MHz and up. The inherent advantages of digital technology over that of analog meant that 2G networks eventually replaced them almost everywhere.|$|E
50|$|LCDs, {{different}} from {{cathode ray tube}} (CRT) displays, have to use <b>digital</b> <b>signaling</b> to show each pixel. While notebook PCs started replacing CRT displays to LCDs, pixel data were transmitted as parallel data, interface systems found the problem that more than 20 cables were required to transmit data with 18 bits color depth for each 6-bit RGB color as well as lack of space for cables and difficulty of adjusting skews.|$|E

50|$|A <b>digital</b> <b>signal</b> is {{a signal}} that is {{constructed}} from a discrete set of waveforms of a physical quantity so as to represent a sequence of discrete values.

This includes specifications for DTE/DCE physical interface elements, alignment of call control characters and error checking, elements of the call control phase for circuit switching services, and test loops.|$|E
50|$|Digital Signal 0 (DS0) {{is a basic}} <b>digital</b> <b>signaling</b> rate of 64 kilobits {{per second}} (kbit/s), {{corresponding}} to the capacity of one analog voice-frequency-equivalent channel. The DS0 rate, and its equivalents E0 and T0, {{form the basis for}} the digital multiplex transmission hierarchy in telecommunications systems used in North America, Europe, Japan, {{and the rest of the}} world, for both the early plesiochronous systems such as T-carrier and for modern synchronous systems such as SDH/SONET.|$|E
50|$|Provided {{that the}} source and {{receiver}} impedances in the differential signaling circuit are equal, external electromagnetic interference tends to affect both conductors identically. Since the receiving circuit only detects {{the difference between the}} wires, the technique resists electromagnetic noise compared to one conductor with an un-paired reference (ground). The technique works for both analog signaling, as in balanced audio—and <b>digital</b> <b>signaling,</b> as in RS-422, RS-485, Ethernet over twisted pair, PCI Express, DisplayPort, HDMI, and USB.|$|E

50|$|Into the 21st century, the {{distinction}} between key systems and PBX systems has become increasingly blurred. Early electronic key systems used dedicated handsets which displayed and allowed access to all connected PSTN lines and stations. The modern key system now supports SIP, ISDN, analog handsets (in addition to its own proprietary handsets - usually digital) {{as well as a}} raft of features more traditionally found on larger PBX systems. Their support for both analog and <b>digital</b> <b>signaling,</b> and of some PBX functionality gives rise to the hybrid designation.|$|E
50|$|RS-422, {{also known}} as TIA/EIA-422, is a {{technical}} standard originated by the Electronic Industries Alliance that specifies electrical characteristics of a <b>digital</b> <b>signaling</b> circuit. Differential signaling can transmit data at rates as high as 10 Mbit/s, or may be sent on cables as long as 1500 meters. Some systems directly interconnect using RS-422 signals, or RS-422 converters {{may be used to}} extend the range of RS-232 connections. The standard only defines signal levels; other properties of a serial interface, such as electrical connectors and pin wiring, are set by other standards.|$|E
