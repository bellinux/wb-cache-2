5|$|A varsity {{baseball}} team is an established part {{of physical education}} departments at most high schools and colleges in the United States. In 2008, {{nearly half a million}} <b>high</b> <b>schoolers</b> and over 35,000 collegians played on their schools' {{baseball team}}s. The number of Americans participating in baseball has declined since the late 1980s, falling well behind the number of soccer participants. By early in the 20th century, intercollegiate baseball was Japan's leading sport. Today, high school baseball in particular is immensely popular there. The final rounds of the two annual tournaments—the National High School Baseball Invitational Tournament in the spring, and the even more important National High School Baseball Championship in the summer—are broadcast around the country. The tournaments are known, respectively, as Spring Koshien and Summer Koshien after the 55,000-capacity stadium where they are played. In Cuba, baseball is a mandatory part of the state system of physical education, which begins at age six. Talented children as young as seven are sent to special district schools for more intensive training—the first step on a ladder whose acme is the national baseball team.|$|E
5|$|While the {{selection}} process is need-blind and race-blind, most of the best high schools and preparatory schools in Brazil are private and very expensive, and represent a majority of admissions in Brazilian public universities, leading to increased inequality in the country. To remedy this, Unicamp introduced in 2004 the Social Inclusion and Affirmative Action Program (PAAIS, in Portuguese Programa de Ação Afirmativa e Inclusão Social) that allows <b>high</b> <b>schoolers</b> coming from public schools to receive a bonus score in their overall vestibular score. While not focused on racial and ethnical factors, over the years, the PAAIS initiative has {{increased the number of}} admission of minorities from public high school, especially black and native-Brazilians, historically the most economical and social fragile groups in Brazil.

The most commercially successful neo-noir of this period has been Sin City (2005), directed by Robert Rodriguez in extravagantly stylized black and white with the odd bit of color. The film is based on a series of comic books created by Frank Miller (credited as the film's codirector), which are in turn openly indebted to the works of Spillane and other pulp mystery authors. Another comic book adaptation with similar style and elements is The Spirit (2008). This film is adapted from the comic book of the same name originally created by cartoonist Will Eisner. Similarly, graphic novels provide the basis for Road to Perdition (2002), directed by Sam Mendes, and A History of Violence (2005), directed by David Cronenberg; the latter was voted best film {{of the year in the}} annual Village Voice poll. Writer-director Rian Johnson's Brick (2005), featuring present-day <b>high</b> <b>schoolers</b> speaking a version of 1930s hardboiled argot, won the Special Jury Prize for Originality of Vision at the Sundance Film Festival.

Having grown up in a rural setting, many elements of the manga are drawn from Arakawa's experiences in her youth. For instance, characters such as the piggery teacher Ichiko Fuji and members of the Holstein fanclub are based on individuals she knew in her high school. Though the story contains matters like the protagonist Yuugo Hachiken's ethical dilemma over animal slaughter, Arakawa insists Silver Spoon is not a [...] "green" [...] manga.

Hartley recalled, I'd developed {{enough of}} a reputation that it wasn't {{difficult to get a}} job at Timely in 1949. Stan Lee knew my work and hired me. When I started working with Stan, he wrote most of my stories, although I later wrote all of my own stories. We did all kinds of genres: war, Westerns, detective, science-fiction — you name it. ... We’d take a theme, and I’d illustrate the story. There were no typed scripts, just a very loose plot line. It was my job to draw the story with as much excitement, surprise, and suspense as I could. Then, Stan would write the dialogue the manner of what would be called the [...] "Marvel Method". It's hard to put a time frame on it, but I'd guess we started working that way in the mid-1950s. As Timely segued into Atlas Comics, Marvel's 1950s predecessor, Hartley made his mark with a more than decade-long run on the Patsy Walker teen-girl titles. With writer-editor Lee, Hartley chronicled the redheaded <b>high</b> <b>schooler's</b> lightly comic adventures in her namesake series (which ran through 1964) and in its spin-offs, Patsy and Hedy (which ran through 1967) and the single-issue A Date with Patsy (Sept. 1957). Well into the Marvel era, Hartley also drew the [...] "Special Queen Size Annual" [...] publication Patsy Walker's Fashion Parade #1 (1966). Walker eventually would be integrated into mainstream Marvel Universe continuity in the 1970s as the supernatural superheroine Hellcat long after Hartley had left the character.Also for Atlas, Hartley co-created Leopard Girl with writer Don Rico in Jungle Action, and drew such features as [...] "The Black Rider" [...] in Wild Western, and [...] "Cliff Mason, White Hunter" [...] in Jungle Tales.

40|$|Abstract: Saudi Arabia (KSA) is {{one among}} the {{countries}} for top energy drink markets. Amid growing controversies globally surrounding the increasing usage of energy drinks by children, it is felt {{important to understand}} how these trends are reflected in KSA. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to explore the trends of energy drink consumption among, and differences between, middle and secondary school children, and the associated socioeconomic and behavioral factors. Randomly selected 1006 male children from secondary and middle schools from Hail region in KSA {{were included in the}} study, using a self-administered validated questionnaire. Results revealed that about 60 % of school children were current energy drink consumers. Secondary school children were significantly (P< 0. 001) <b>higher</b> than middle <b>schoolers</b> in terms of both frequency and quantity. Concomitantly, unhealthy dietary and lifestyle behaviors were reported in significantly higher proportions (P< 0. 001) among secondary school children. Home was the first place for exposure for majority of children while unreliable resources were the major sources of knowledge about energy drink composition and health effects. Poor knowledge concerning energy drink composition was reported. Taste and being energized were the major driving forces for energy drink consumption. Higher disposable income on hand and poor lifestyle behaviors were all significantly associated with energy drink consumption. It can be concluded that high proportion of energy drink consumption was reported among school children in Hail, with higher proportions in secondary than middle schools. This matter raises the significance of mounting awareness of community concerning the ingredient...|$|R
