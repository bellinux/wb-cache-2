25|$|The {{ellipsoidal}} reflector spotlight (ERS), {{also known as}} profile (after its ability to project the silhouette or profile of anything put in the gate) (UK) and Découpe (French), is the most abundant <b>instrument</b> <b>type</b> currently in theatrical use. The flexibility of the ERS allows it to fulfill the bulk of lighting roles in the theater. They are sometimes known as a profile spotlight (in Europe) or by their brand names, especially the Source Four (a popular lantern from ETC) and 2 the Leko (short for Lekolite, from Strand lighting).|$|E
25|$|Many {{regional}} {{variants of}} the Celtic horns are known {{and came in}} different shapes, sizes and diameters, like the Loughnashade Trumpa from Ireland and similar horns from Scandinavia and other regions. Couissin (1927) documented a third Celtic wind <b>instrument</b> <b>type</b> with a bent horn, similar to the Caledonian Caprington Horn or the infamous prehistoric Sussex horn that was however lost and of which only drawings and reproductions survive. It is not known whether the horn mentioned by Couissin was a fragment of another Celtic horn or a simple cow horn of the rural population, a bowed horn-instrument known all across Europe.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that digital {{technology}} has become an inevitable tool in music production and distribution {{during the course of}} the past few decades, live performers of digital musical instruments (DMIs) remain enigmatic to a majority of music audiences. A combination of instrument design issues, limits to the human cognitive system, and cultural constraints may all be contributing factors to these circumstances. This thesis presents a theoretical overview of some challenges in the development of DMIs, weighed against an empirical study based on qualitative research interviews with six DMI performers. Additionally, <b>instrument</b> <b>types</b> are categorized according to the order of separation between action and sound when performing with the instrument (incorporated, direct, mechanical, analog electronic and digital), and a hypothesis regarding the influence of <b>instrument</b> <b>types</b> on the music cognition of performers is tested...|$|R

50|$|The {{main reason}} for using NSE is that by the above means it can reach Fourier times of up to many 100ns, which {{corresponds}} to energyresolutions in the neV range. The closest approach to this resolution by a spectroscopic neutron <b>instrument</b> <b>type,</b> namely the backscattering spectrometer (BSS), is {{in the range of}} 0.5 to 1 &mu;eV. The spin-echo trick allows to use an intense beam of neutrons with a wavelength distribution of 10% or more {{and at the same time}} to besensitive to velocity changes in the range of less than 10−4.|$|E
50|$|Because {{variety of}} tone colour was {{considered}} paramount, the double horn, though easier {{to play and}} more secure, was not adopted by the Viennese orchestras. The Vienna horn is, in essence, the natural horn of the Viennese classical era with double piston valves added by the instrument maker Leopold Uhlmann (1806-1878). The trumpet, instead of having the almost universal Perinet piston valves , is the old German model with rotary valves, while the F tuba is its own <b>instrument</b> <b>type.</b> The trombone in Viennese orchestras is the usual type, although here, too, the preference is for the tonal quality of a narrower bore.|$|E
