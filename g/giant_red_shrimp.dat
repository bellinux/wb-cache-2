Few somatic cells were found around the oocytes, but they never gave place to a continuous epithelial layer around oocytes, thus it is not possible to speak of ovarian follicle. The cytoplasm of these mesodermal-oocyte associated cells (MOAC) was characterized by a typical steroidogenic apparatus. Few resorptive immature oocytes were found inside late vitellogenic oocytes.

In this paper, data on abundance (both number and biomass) of A. antennatus and A. foliacea resulting from the MEDITS surveys from 1994 to 2004, carried out with common protocols in seven Mediterranean FAO GFCM Geographical Sub Areas (GSAs), have been analyzed using standardized methodologies. Both red shrimps species occur almost exclusively on the “meso bathyal” stratum (500 800 m). The distribution pattern appears quite different for the two species, but no significant trends in density and biomass (neither at geographical nor at temporal level) could be detected. Sardinia shows the highest abundance for both species, although with some local negative tendencies along time. A very high interannual variability was detected in all areas. Comparing the present results to those recorded by Cau et al. in 2002, a more or less stable status of the deep sea red shrimps stocks was observed, which is not an encouraging finding when considering the reduction in fishing capacity and the management measures adopted by the EU in recent years...|$|E

The shrimp was mainly found in the shallower zone (< 1000 m) of the eastern Ionian Sea. Few specimens {{were caught in the}} deeper waters of this region, with 1100 m being the lower limit of its distribution. This is the maximum depth reported for the species in the Mediterranean. At the other two locations, the species was scarcely caught and only in the shallowest zone (< 1000 m). In the area and depth zone of high abundance, 5 modal groups for females and 3 for males were distinguished using the Bhattacharya method. The recruitment seems to take place at the shallowest stations (600 m). More than 50 % of adult females were in advanced maturity stages. The striking abundance differences of the species between the western and eastern locations may be explained by the different exploitation level of the deep waters (almost null in the eastern Ionian Sea and extensive more westwards).

Biophysical simulations using the hydrodynamic conditions of the year 2012 were run to track propagules released from known spawning areas during the spawning period (May to September). Passive transport (PT) and vertical migration (VM) scenarios were tested, each with two possible pelagic larval durations (PLDs) of 21 or 42  days. Dispersion of propagules in the PT and VM scenarios differed in terms of travelled distance, export out of the domain (larger for VM), and depth distribution (shallower and bimodal for VM due to the larger variability of encountered currents). Connectivity patterns were investigated among eight release areas, and four predetermined Eco-Regions, and results showed strong connectivity among the North-Western (NW), Western (W), and Southern (S) regions of Sardinia, whereas the Eastern region was more segregated. Differences in connectivity patterns among scenarios were related mainly to the tendency of greater retention of propagules in the release area for the PT scenarios. This finding, together with existing hypotheses of vertical migration likely occurring during first egg-larval phases, suggest that the VM scenarios are the most probable of the two hypotheses tested. Strong connectivity between the W and S sides of Sardinia and the relative isolation of the E side could have significant implications {{for the protection of}} this important resource...|$|E

It also adopts a holistic approach to fisheries management, considering all factors driving fishers' behavior, and ultimately, the long-term maintenance of living resources. The most reliable way to pursue these aims could be represented by {{a change in the}} exploitation pattern, in order to guarantee the sustainability of fisheries without compromising their socioeconomic viability. In this paper, the demersal fisheries of the Ionian Sea [Geographic Sub-area (GSA) 19] were analyzed with respect to their spatial, temporal, economic, and biological characteristics in terms of four key species for fisheries, namely European hake, red mullet, <b>giant</b> <b>red</b> <b>shrimp,</b> and deep-water rose shrimp. Specifically, (1) a quantitative procedure was applied to break down the whole system (including small-scale fleet components) into a series of fishing grounds using input data about fishing efforts; (2) the different fleet segments were defined as a combination of main gear and fishing grounds; (3) the effort and production by fleet segment were derived according to biological samplings of commercial data (Data Collection Framework for the collection and management of fisheries data, DCF), information on localization of nursery and spawning grounds, and expert knowledge; and (4) all this information was used to feed a bioeconomic modeling tool (BEMTOOL), and to explore alternative exploitation patterns. A series of scenarios including the status quo were defined, starting from the actual management approach based on temporal fishing closure. The results showed that significant improvements in the exploitation pattern could be achieved by setting up spatial and/or temporal gear-specific bans of the fishing activity. More specifically, scenarios based on a 3 -month fishing ban for trawlers are expected to provide high rebuilding of the spawning stock biomass (SSB) for all target stocks, and at the same time, result in a remarkable reduction of discards. When combined with a seasonal fishing ban for small-scale fleets equipped with nets and longlines, this approach could lead to a significant improvement in all indicators, but especially the SSB of the exploited species...|$|E

Species Description These shrimp are very small, with males reaching only 8 - 10 mm and females reaching 11 - 16 mm. They have large, stalked eyes and eight pairs of legs.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to identify the potential of new deep-sea fisheries in the Colombian Caribbean Sea determining their biomass and spatial distribution in order to advice management and conservation strategies, based on ecosystem approach to fisheries management. First, I examine morphological characteristics of the shallow water pink shrimp Farfantepenaeus notialis to investigate stock differentiation, presenting biological data such as size at 50 % sexual maturity. The data onF. notialis were obtained from samples collected from June to December 2004, on board of commercial fishing vessels and from a time series of historic landings of catch and effort data. I did not find morphometric variability between the studied regions, which indicates the existence of a single population of F. notialis from a morphometric point of view. This study provides the first complete view, to date, of the stock structure and fishery dynamics of the pink shrimp F. notialis in the Colombian Caribbean Sea. This fishery is a typical case in which high exploitation, combined with non-existent fisheries management, have resulted in the significant depletion of stock. In response to this, I investigate possible new fishing areas, exploring the poorly understood deep sea habitats in the Colombian Caribbean Sea, to determine the potential for a viable deep-sea crustacean fishery. The sampling area extended from 100 m the isobaths to 600 m depth. I found high abundances ofthe <b>giant</b> <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> (Aristaeomorpha foliacea), the royal red shrimp (Pleoticus robustus), the pink speckled deep-sea shrimp (Penaeopsis serrata) and the deep-sea lobster (Metanephrops binghami) obtained in two experimental trawl surveys carried out in November and December 2009, all of which are important commercially. The highest biomassess of these deep-sea crustaceans species were found mainly in the northern zone of the Colombian Caribbean Sea, where the local oceanography is modulated by high productive seasonal upwelling. However, further scientific assessment is necessary to determine population life cycle parameters of these deep-sea crustaceans and associated biodiversity before initiating a new commercial fishery. Studies of deep-sea biodiversity are necessary {{in order to understand the}} degree of stability and vulnerability of deep-sea environments and enable comparison of conditions before and after exploitation of the fishery. This will enable a better understanding of the ecosystem, to advise ecosystem-based conservation and fisheries management strategies. The aim of thislaststudy was to identify deep-sea fish assemblages across a depth range of 200 - 550 m from the Colombian Caribbean Sea and their implications for an ecosystem approach to fisheries management. Classification (Cluster analysis) and ordination (non-parametric multidimensional scaling NMDS) were performed to identify deep-sea fish assemblages. A total of 102 species (13 Chondrichthyes and 89 Teleosteans) and 58 families (9 Chondrichthyes and 49 Teleosteans) of deep-sea fish were sampled. This study reveals the existence of three deep-sea fish assemblages and demostrates that depth plays an important role in ichthyofaunal differentiation. I conclude that, the management of the shallow shrimp fishery and the potential new deep-sea crustacean fishery should be based on an ecosystem approach that considers population dynamics and structure, the optimum allocation of catches and effort, protection of nursery and spawning areas, the development of monitoring strategies and the care of ecosystems...|$|E
