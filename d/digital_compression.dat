25|$|Interactivity can be {{considered}} a central concept in understanding new media, but different media forms possess, or enable different degrees of interactivity, and some forms of digitized and converged media are not in fact interactive at all. Tony Feldman considers digital satellite television {{as an example of a}} new media technology that uses <b>digital</b> <b>compression</b> to dramatically increase the number of television channels that can be delivered, and which changes the nature of what can be offered through the service, but does not transform the experience of television from the user's point of view, and thus lacks a more fully interactive dimension. It remains the case that interactivity is not an inherent characteristic of all new media technologies, unlike digitization and convergence.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{concerns}} <b>digital</b> image <b>compression</b> using adaptive thinning algorithms. Adaptive thinning is a recursive point removal scheme {{which works}} with decremental Delaunay triangulations. When applied to digital images, adaptive thinning returns a scattered set of most significant pixels. This requires efficient and customized methods for coding these pixels (but not their connectivities). To this end, we propose a hierarchical coding scheme, which works with recursive subdivisions of octtree cells, and which {{takes advantage of}} the statistical data correlation. The good performance of the resulting compression scheme is shown in comparison with the well-established wavelet-based method SPIHT. <b>Digital</b> image <b>compression</b> has recently gained enormous popularity in a variety of applications. This is especially due to the rapid development of multimedia technologies. <b>Digital</b> image <b>compression</b> is concerned with th...|$|R
