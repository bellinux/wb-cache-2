5000|$|Strathisla {{distillery}} is {{the oldest}} continuously operating distillery in Scotland. It was founded as the Milltown Distillery by George Taylor and Alexander Milne in 1786 {{as an alternative to}} the waning of <b>flax</b> <b>dressing</b> industry. They leased the land from the Earl of Seafield.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with the}} main Flax Mill, {{a number of other}} {{buildings}} in the group are listed for their architectural and historic value: the apprentice house (Grade II*); the dye house (Grade II*); the <b>flax</b> <b>dressing</b> building (Grade II*); the flax warehouse (Grade II); the stables (Grade II); and the workshops and offices (Grade II). The mill and buildings are on the Heritage at Risk Register.|$|E

50|$|Stratford traded {{first in}} Cheshire cheese and woollen hose from the country, but then {{switched}} to rough flax, linen yarn, wheat, and rye, bought from Baltic merchants {{in exchange for}} English broadcloth. He entered into partnership with John Hopkins, a fellow apprentice, who also married one of Robinson's daughters. When, through a second marriage, Hopkins became a kinsman of one Vickares, a woollen draper, Hopkins took over the broadcloth trade and Stratford concentrated on the flax trade, in partnership with three others, his half-brother Ralph, Thomas Lane, married to a third daughter of Robinson, and Humphrey Thornbury. They prospered and employed many poor in and near London to <b>dress</b> <b>flax,</b> until the Dutch brought in <b>dressed</b> <b>flax</b> and business diminished.|$|R
50|$|In winter 1823 Captain John Rodolphus Kent went to Foveaux Strait, filled 14 large casks with flax, bought 1100 lb of <b>dressed</b> <b>flax,</b> {{and took}} 25 flax plants. That trip was {{by way of}} an {{experiment}} to confirm the value of flax, but he continued trading until 1836 and several other traders followed his example.|$|R
5000|$|In 1830 Fairbanks and Erastus became {{interested}} in the raising and processing of hemp. Fairbanks, being mechanically minded, made and patented a hemp and <b>flax</b> <b>dressing</b> machine at this time. He became the manager of the St. Johnsbury Hemp Company. He also built a set of scales that would measure large loads of hemp accurately, as there were no sure scales at the time that would do this. Upon the success of building these scales his brothers recommended that he make and sell these as town scales. Fairbanks obtained an agent to attempt this and remarked, ...|$|E
50|$|The farm {{may have}} been {{involved}} in <b>flax</b> <b>dressing</b> at one time, a retting pond is known to have existed at Windyhouse Farm and a lint mill was located on the Powgree Burn {{at the far end of}} Kersland Glen near Longbar. A room in Roughwood Farm has an unusual floor with four separately supported sides creating slopes down to a central area. This {{may have been}} the heckling shed where flax was processed and the spent material, called 'tow', was collected for further use in stuffing pilloes, etc or simply for removal as it was highly combustible and fires in heckling shops were common.|$|E
50|$|During {{the years}} 1781-1782, {{at the age}} of 23, Robert Burns (1759-1796) lived in Irvine, North Ayrshire for a period of around 9 months, whilst {{learning}} the craft of flax-dressing from Alexander Peacock, who may have been his mother's half-brother, working at the heckling shop in the Glasgow Vennel. Dr John Cumming of Milgarholm, a provost of Irvine, claimed that he had invited Burns to come to Irvine to learn <b>flax</b> <b>dressing.</b> During this time he made a number of acquaintances, befriended several locals and took regular walks into the Eglinton Woods via the old Irvine to Kilwinning toll road and the Drukken or Drucken (Drunken) Steps over the Red Burn and back via the site of Saint Brides or Bryde's Well at Stanecastle. Burns had several other connections with the Eglinton Estate and other branches of the Montgomerie family. He probably left in March 1782.|$|E
5000|$|Flax or Flaxen is a pale yellowish-gray, {{the color}} of straw or unspun <b>dressed</b> <b>flax.</b> An early use of [...] "flaxen" [...] to {{describe}} hair color appears in David Copperfield, by Charles Dickens: Mr. Omer's granddaughter, Minnie, is described as [...] "a pretty little girl with long, flaxen, curling hair." [...] The first recorded use of flax as a color name in English was in 1915.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, {{it became}} so {{difficult}} to obtain supplies of <b>dressed</b> <b>flax</b> from the Maori that he gave up the ropemaking trade. James {{then went to the}} goldfields in Otago, Ballarat in Australia, and Thames, without luck. While he was away, Elizabeth ran a small shop he had built on the front of their house in Napier St, Freemans Bay. The shop was owned by the family until 1910.|$|R
5000|$|Heckling (or [...] "hackling") is {{the last}} of three steps in <b>dressing</b> <b>flax,</b> or {{preparing}} the fibers to be spun. It splits and straightens the flax fibers, as well as removing the fibrous core and impurities. Heckling is done with heckling combs by pulling the flax through the combs. This parts the locked fibers and makes them straight, clean, and ready to spin. After which the flax is then suitable for weaving into linen.|$|R
25|$|The three set up {{a company}} called the Tongariro Timber Company Limited with the {{intention}} to construct the railway and to have branch lines heading into the bush at various points along the route to harvest the native timber along the way. The railway {{was intended to be}} paid for using some of the large sums of money expected to be earned from the timber to be harvested. It was agreed that the land would remain in Maori ownership and that the Tongariro Timber Company Limited would operate the railway. Once the railway was built the company would carry freight other than timber, such as <b>dressed</b> <b>flax</b> and grain, and passengers at Government rates. The railway would connect with a ferry service on Lake Taupo.|$|R
50|$|Hetet {{was born}} in Oparure, King Country, New Zealand on 24 May 1892, the {{daughter}} of Charles Wilson Hursthouse and Mere Te Rongopamamao Aubrey. Through her father she was a niece of Richmond Hursthouse and Henry Robert Richmond. As her father was generally away for survey work, she grew up amongst Ngati Kinohaku, a hapū (sub-tribe) of Ngati Maniapoto. In 1899, her father instructed for her {{to live with a}} European family at Paemako near Piopio, where she started her schooling. She was unhappy with the arrangements and a year later, she moved to live with an older half-sister in Kāwhia. After breaking her arm aged nine, she returned to live with her mother, and attended Te Kuiti Native School and then Oparure Native School. She was taught the art of weaving korowai (<b>dressed</b> <b>flax</b> cloaks) by her mother.|$|R
5000|$|Responsibility for the {{beginning}} of the musket wars is usually attributed to Ngāpuhi chief Hongi Hika, who in 1818 used newly acquired muskets to launch devastating raids from his Northland base into the Bay of Plenty, where local Māori were still relying on traditional weapons of wood and stone. In the following years he launched equally successful raids on iwi in Auckland, Thames, Waikato and Lake Rotorua, taking large numbers of his enemies as slaves, who were put to work cultivating and <b>dressing</b> <b>flax</b> to trade with Europeans for more muskets. His success prompted other iwi to procure firearms in order to mount effective methods of defence and deterrence and the spiral of violence peaked in 1832 and 1833, by which time it had spread to all parts of the country except the inland area of the North Island later known as the King Country and remote bays and valleys of Fiordland in the South Island. In 1835 the fighting went offshore as Ngāti Mutunga and Ngāti Tama launched devastating raids on the pacifist Moriori in the Chatham Islands.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 There {{is growing}} public {{concern about the}} high {{proportion}} of saturated fatty acids in milk fat; however, feed intake, energy partitioning toward milk synthesis, and milk fat concentrations can decrease when cows are fed high concentrations of unsaturated lipids. The objective {{of this study was}} to identify the optimal rate for feeding OmegaBoostTM (a flaxseed supplement that was processed using a proprietary technique by Double Pass LLC, Tualatin, OR) to dairy cows. The central hypothesis was that supplementation with OmegaBoost will decrease the proportion of saturated fatty acids in milk fat in a dose dependent manner. Using a latin-square design, 10 Holstein cows in mid to late lactation were fed for two-week periods 0, 2, 4, or 6 lbs/d of OmegaBoost or 4 lbs/d ground <b>flax</b> as top <b>dressing</b> to their total mixed ration. Feed intake, body weight, activity and resting time, milk production and milk composition were measured daily. At the end of each two-week period, milk and serum samples were taken and analyzed for fatty acid composition using gas chromatography. In addition, fresh Mozzarella cheese and butter was manufactured and tested to determine the fatty acid composition and the effects of flaxseed supplementation on texture. Feeding OmegaBoost at 2, 4, and 6 lbs/d linearly decreased the proportion of saturated fatty acids in milk by 6, 15, and 18...|$|R
5000|$|Although Joseph Taylor appears {{always to}} have been the senior partner, he is a shadowy figure, with few records {{surviving}} to show how he contributed to the firm’s success. Joshua Wordsworth appears {{to have been}} the engineering part of the partnership. He was granted a string of patents for improvements to machinery for spinning, and for heckling and <b>dressing</b> <b>flax.</b> [...] By 1831, Taylor Wordsworth and Co employed about 100 householders, described as the ‘highest class of mechanics’. [...] They also produced machines to the designs of other inventors: in a court case in January 1836, Joshua Wordsworth noted that Taylor Wordsworth and Co had made ‘a great many of Mr Kay’s machines; I suppose some hundreds’, and they were also known to produce woolcombs in conjunction with Samuel Lister of Manningham, Bradford. [...] The firm had a ready market for their machinery on their doorstep, in the shape of Marshall's Mill, owned by the leading industrialist, John Marshall, who went on to build another big flax mill, Temple Works in Holbeck in 1836. [...] The two firms appear to have become close, to the point where, by August 1844, they organised a joint ‘away weekend’ in Liverpool for their workers, a prospect which caused even the editor of the normally liberal Leeds Mercury some concern: ...|$|R
