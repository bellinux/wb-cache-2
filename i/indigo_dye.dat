5|$|Sundanese or Priangan Batik is {{the term}} for batik from the Priangan region of West Java and Banten. Although Priangan batiks can use {{a wide range of}} colours, a {{preference}} for indigo is seen in some of its variants. Natural <b>indigo</b> <b>dye</b> made from Indigofera is among the oldest known dyes in Java, and its local name tarum has lent its name to the Citarum river and the Tarumanagara kingdom, which suggests that ancient West Java was once a major producer of natural indigo. Noted Priangan batik is produced in Ciamis, Garut, and Tasikmalaya. Other traditions include Batik Kuningan influenced by batik Cirebon, batik Banten that developed quite independently, and an older tradition of batik Baduy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract ― To achieve color {{diversification}} of natural dyeing, color mixture <b>dyeing</b> with <b>Indigo</b> and Japanese pagoda tree {{is applied to}} wool and silk fabrics. After dyeing with Japanese pagoda tree extract solution of 5 ~ 25 %(o. w. f.), the <b>indigo</b> <b>dyeing</b> was carried out up to four times. Alternatively after repeat <b>dyeing</b> with <b>indigo</b> one to seven times, the dyeing with Japanese pagoda tree extract solution was applied in 5 steps(5 ~ 25 %). In color mixture dyeing, the dye uptake of wool fabrics appears {{higher than that of}} silk. The sequence of Japanese pagoda tree extract <b>dyeing</b> after <b>Indigo</b> <b>dyeing</b> was generally higher dye uptake compared with that of <b>Indigo</b> <b>dyeing</b> after Japanese pagoda tree extract dyeing. For wool and silk fabric, the pre-dyeing with Japanese pagoda tree solution was more effective for color diversification but the pre-dyeing with Indigo was more effective for the exhibition of intermediate color shade...|$|R

Colour fastness to washing, rubbing and light were performed. Colour strength of fabrics was calculated from Kubelka–Munk formula. Highest vividness (C∗) values were obtained by Ni mordant. Moderate fastness values were observed.

25|$|In the 17th century, Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, {{was one of}} {{the first}} rulers to give his army blue uniforms. The reasons were economic; the German states were trying to protect their pastel dye {{industry}} against competition from imported <b>indigo</b> <b>dye.</b> When Brandenburg became the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701, the uniform colour was adopted by the Prussian army. Most German soldiers wore dark blue uniforms until the First World War, with the exception of the Bavarians, who wore light blue.|$|E
25|$|Thanks {{in part to}} the {{availability}} of <b>indigo</b> <b>dye,</b> the 18th century saw the widespread use of blue military uniforms. Prior to 1748, British naval officers simply wore upper-class civilian clothing and wigs. In 1748, the British uniform for naval officers was officially established as an embroidered coat of the colour then called marine blue, now known as navy blue. When the Continental Navy of the United States was created in 1775, it largely copied the British uniform and colour.|$|E

The company's mainstay businesses were by then cotton, silk, <b>indigo</b> <b>dye,</b> saltpetre, and tea. The Dutch were aggressive competitors and had meanwhile expanded their monopoly of the spice trade in the Straits of Malacca by ousting the Portuguese in 1640–41. With reduced Portuguese and Spanish influence in the region, the EIC and VOC entered a period of intense competition, resulting in the Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th and 18th centuries.|$|E

One assumption made in the search for an endogenous ligand is that the ligand will be a receptor agonist. However, work by Savouret et al. has shown {{this may not be the}} case since their findings demonstrate that 7-ketocholesterol competitively inhibits Ahr signal transduction.|$|E
25|$|Coastal {{navigation}} and {{the export of}} locally-produced goods (salt, wine and fabrics) dominated the local economy around 1600. During the mid-17th century, the siltation of local salterns and a fall in wine exports compelled Nantes to find other activities. Local shipowners began importing sugar from the French West Indies (Martinique, Guadeloupe and Saint-Domingue) in the 1640s, which became very profitable after protectionist reforms implemented by Jean-Baptiste Colbert prevented the import of sugar from Spanish colonies (which had dominated the market). In 1664 Nantes was France's eighth-largest port, {{and it was the}} largest by 1700. Plantations in the colonies needed labour to produce sugar, rum, tobacco, <b>indigo</b> <b>dye,</b> coffee and cocoa, and Nantes shipowners began trading African slaves in 1706. The port was part of the triangular trade: ships went to West Africa to buy slaves, slaves were sold in the French West Indies, and the ships returned to Nantes with sugar and other exotic goods. From 1707 to 1793, Nantes was responsible for 42 percent of the French slave trade; its merchants sold about 450,000 African slaves in the West Indies.|$|E
