5|$|A {{document}} that purports to be a subversive document {{is presumed to}} be one until the contrary has been proved, {{and if it is}} proved that a person was carrying or had in his or her possession or under his or her control a subversive document, <b>he</b> <b>or</b> she is deemed to have known the contents of the document and their nature.
