The weed component of the forage in addition to {{the time of the first}} harvest affected the forage quality. The CP content of the untreated annual weeds and quackgrass (8 to 15 %) was lower than alfalfa (18 to 20 %). The CP content of the forage increased as the weed component decreased. The ADF content of the first harvest forage varied between the annual <b>grass</b> <b>weeds</b> and alfalfa, however the higher ADF content of quackgrass (40 %) compared to alfalfa (33 to 35 %) will reduce the digestibility of the forage. The higher NDF content of the untreated annual <b>grass</b> <b>weeds</b> (65 to 75 %) compared to alfalfa (48 to 55 %) will reduce the voluntary intake of the forage. Reduced heribicide rates resulted in lower weed control but increased the CP content and decreased the ADF and NDF content of the remaining weed component.

More information on impact of grass weeds on sorghum yield are needed to optimize the application of nicosulfuron. The research objectives were to evaluate the impact of time of <b>grass</b> <b>weed</b> removal on grain sorghum yield when grown in different crop row spacing and seeding rates and to determine the critical duration of <b>grass</b> <b>weed</b> competition. Field studies were conducted in 2014 and 2015 at the KSU Agricultural Research Center at Hays, KS and the KSU Department of Agronomy Research Farm near Manhattan, KS. Four main treatments were grain sorghum row spacing of 25 and 76 cm at Hays or 20 and 76 cm at Manhattan, and two seeding rates of 125, 000 and 150, 000 seed ha⁻¹. Within each main plot, seven treatments were established including: weed-free all season using pre-emergence herbicides, weed-free all season by hand, weedy for 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks after crop emergence in 2014 or weedy for 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after crop emergence in 2015, and weedy all season.
