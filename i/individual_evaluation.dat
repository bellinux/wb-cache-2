40|$|Because of the {{inherently}} cross-functional nature of customer relationship management, {{the use of}} cross-functional teams in CRM project implementations is virtually mandatory to achieve critical marketing and sales objectives. This study examines the effects of functional membership as well as team and <b>individual</b> performance <b>evaluations</b> on project members' perceptions of disruption and cooperation during CRM project implementations. The results show that IS project members {{are more likely to}} perceive internal volatility and manifest interfunctional conflict and less likely to perceive interfunctional cooperation than project members from either sales/marketing or general management. We also find that team performance evaluations are negatively associated with disruption and positively associated with cooperation, while <b>individual</b> <b>evaluations</b> are negatively associated with internal volatility. ...|$|R

Types of analysis that are of interest includes both those on gas-phase reactions, as well as heterogeneous reactions that are relevant to the formation and growth of aerosols. Also of high importance is the study of atmospheric photochemistry which quantifies how the rate in which molecules are split apart by sunlight and what resulting products are.

The second part is the inevitable <b>individual</b> <b>evaluation.</b> Se-jun shocks the group by revealing that this is the final evaluation, after this challenge three trainees will be automatically eliminated and the final line-up will be decided. The rappers Ravi and Byoungjun are chosen by Se-jun as the two team leaders. The two of them however go about choosing the members for the respective teams in a disorganized manner. In the end Ravi's team consists of himself, Leo, HongBin, Yoonchul and Hyuk, while Byoungjun's team consists of Ken, N, Nakhun and himself.|$|E
