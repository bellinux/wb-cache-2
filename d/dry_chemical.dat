5000|$|Fires are {{classified}} by the proper extinguishing agent. While water {{is used to}} fire Class A fires, using water on a class B fire (such as a grease fire) is extremely dangerous. This is because burning grease is hotter that the boiling point of water (212 degrees Fahrenheit or 100 degrees Celsius); when water is placed on grease, it creates steam which expands rapidly and splatters, causing burns and spreading the fire). Because of this, Class A fire extinguishers use water, while Class B fire extinguishers use <b>dry</b> <b>chemicals</b> (foam or powder), such as aqueous film-forming foam, multi-purpose <b>dry</b> <b>chemicals</b> such as ammonium phosphate, and halogenated agents (such as Halon 1301 and Halon 1211).

40|$|There are {{two types}} of mixed-phase systems with two fire {{suppression}} agents of powders and gases. The first type is halocarbon gelled <b>dry</b> <b>chemicals,</b> including monoammonium phosphate (MAP) powder thixotropically gelled with halon 1211 and 1301, sodium bicarbonate (BC) powder gelled with pentafluoropropane (HFC- 125) and hexafluoropropane (HFC- 236 fa). The second type is halocarbon combined with <b>dry</b> <b>chemicals,</b> such as BC in conjunction with heptafluoropapane (FE- 227 ea), ammonia polyphosphate (APP) disseminated by HFC- 236 fa and MAP discharged with halon 2402. These mixed-phase fire suppressants would have better performance in suppressing fire to get shorter burning time with less agent mass but generating smaller amount of toxic products. However, there are technical problems while changing nitrogen to halocarbon. Physical design of the extinguisher has to change for the new mixed agents.

25|$|Condensed aerosol fire {{suppression}} is a particle-based form of fire extinction similar to gaseous {{fire suppression}} or <b>dry</b> <b>chemical</b> fire extinction. As with gaseous fire suppressants, condensed aerosol suppressants use clean agents {{to suppress the}} fire. The agent can be delivered by means of mechanical operation, electric operation, or combined electro-mechanical operation. To the difference of gaseous suppressants, which emit only gas, and <b>dry</b> <b>chemical</b> extinguishers, which release powder-like particles of a large size (25–150µm) condensed aerosols are defined by the National Fire Protection Association as releasing finely divided solid particles (generally <10nbsp&µm), usually in addition to gas.|$|E
25|$|Foam-compatible, {{which is}} a sodium {{bicarbonate}} (BC) based <b>dry</b> <b>chemical,</b> was developed for use with protein foams for fighting class B fires. Most dry chemicals contain metal stearates to waterproof them, but these will tend to destroy the foam blanket created by protein (animal) based foams.

Effectiveness is identical to regular <b>dry</b> <b>chemical,</b> and it is light green in color (some ANSUL brand formulations are blue). This agent is generally no longer used since most modern dry chemicals are considered compatible with synthetic foams such as AFFF.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} types of fire extinguishers: stored-{{pressure}} and cartridge-operated. In stored pressure units, the expellant is stored in the same chamber as the firefighting agent itself. Depending on the agent used, different propellants are used. With <b>dry</b> <b>chemical</b> extinguishers, nitrogen is typically used; water and foam extinguishers typically use air. Stored pressure fire extinguishers {{are the most common}} type. Cartridge-operated extinguishers contain the expellant gas in a separate cartridge that is punctured prior to discharge, exposing the propellant to the extinguishing agent. This type is not as common, used primarily in areas such as industrial facilities, where they receive higher-than-average use. They have the advantage of simple and prompt recharge, allowing an operator to discharge the extinguisher, recharge it, and return to the fire in a reasonable amount of time. Unlike stored pressure types, these extinguishers use compressed carbon dioxide instead of nitrogen, although nitrogen cartridges are used on low temperature (-60 rated) models. Cartridge operated extinguishers are available in <b>dry</b> <b>chemical</b> and dry powder types in the U.S. and in water, wetting agent, foam, <b>dry</b> <b>chemical</b> (classes ABC and B.C.), and dry powder (class D) types {{in the rest of the}} world.|$|E

25|$|In 1928, DuGas (later {{bought by}} ANSUL) {{came out with}} a cartridge-operated <b>dry</b> <b>chemical</b> extinguisher, which used sodium {{bicarbonate}} specially treated with chemicals to render it free-flowing and moisture-resistant. It consisted of a copper cylinder with an internal CO2cartridge. The operator turned a wheel valve on top to puncture the cartridge and squeezed a lever on the valve {{at the end of the}} hose to discharge the chemical. This was the first agent available for large-scale three-dimensional liquid and pressurized gas fires, and was but remained largely a specialty type until the 1950s, when small <b>dry</b> <b>chemical</b> units were marketed for home use. ABC <b>dry</b> <b>chemical</b> came over from Europe in the 1950s, with Super-K being invented in the early 60s and Purple-K being developed by the US Navy in the late 1960s. Manually applied dry agents such as graphite for class D (metal) fires had existed since WWII, but it wasn't until 1949 that Ansul introduced a pressurized extinguisher using an external CO2 cartridge to discharge the agent. Met-L-X (sodium chloride) was the first extinguisher developed in the US, with graphite, copper, and several other types being developed later.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{bicarbonate}} {{can be used}} {{to extinguish}} small grease or electrical fires by being thrown over the fire, as heating of sodium bicarbonate releases carbon dioxide. However, it should not be applied to fires in deep fryers; the sudden release of gas may cause the grease to splatter. Sodium bicarbonate is used in BC <b>dry</b> <b>chemical</b> fire extinguishers {{as an alternative to the}} more corrosive diammonium phosphate in ABC extinguishers. The alkaline nature of sodium bicarbonate makes it the only <b>dry</b> <b>chemical</b> agent, besides Purple-K, that was used in large-scale fire suppression systems installed in commercial kitchens. Because it can act as an alkali, the agent has a mild saponification effect on hot grease, which forms a smothering, soapy foam.|$|E

25|$|This is {{a powder}} based agent that extinguishes by {{separating}} the four {{parts of the}} fire tetrahedron.

25|$|Sodium bicarbonate, {{regular or}} {{ordinary}} used on class B and C fires, {{was the first}} of the <b>dry</b> <b>chemical</b> agents developed. In the heat of a fire, it releases a cloud of carbon dioxide that smothers the fire. That is, the gas drives oxygen away from the fire, thus stopping the chemical reaction. This agent is not generally effective on class A fires because the agent is expended and the cloud of gas dissipates quickly, and if the fuel is still sufficiently hot, the fire starts up again. While liquid and gas fires do not usually store much heat in their fuel source, solid fires do. Sodium bicarbonate was very common in commercial kitchens before the advent of wet chemical agents, but now is falling out of favor, as it is much less effective than wet chemical agents for class K fires, less effective than Purple-K for class B fires, and is ineffective on class A fires.
