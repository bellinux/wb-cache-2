5|$|In {{the last}} year of his life, Milk {{emphasized}} that gay people should be more visible to help to end the discrimination and violence against them. Although Milk had not come out to his mother before her death many years before, in his final statement during his taped prediction of his assassination, he urged others to do so: I cannot prevent anyone from <b>getting</b> <b>angry,</b> or mad, or frustrated. I can only hope that they'll turn that anger and frustration and madness into something positive, so that two, three, four, five hundred will step forward, so the gay doctors will come out, the gay lawyers, the gay judges, gay bankers, gay architects... I hope that every professional gay will say 'enough', come forward and tell everybody, wear a sign, let the world know. Maybe that will help.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, when Elsa {{becomes a}} young adult, she {{is set to}} be crowned queen. The people of Arendelle are joyously {{preparing}} for her coronation day. Anna is flushed with excitement as the castle gates are opened {{for the first time}} since the sisters' childhood. The young princess expresses how cheerful she is when she leaves her lonely life and meets people, as well as her hopes to find romance and a love interest. While exploring the town, Anna bumps into a horse owned by Prince Hans of the Southern Isles. Despite the awkward meeting at first, the pair quickly get acquainted and develop a mutual attraction for each other. Though Elsa fears of her secret being revealed to the public, her coronation goes on without incident. At the reception party, Anna is offered a waltz from Hans and the two have a date around the kingdom. They later find out that they have much in common, and Anna agrees to Hans' marriage proposal. Anna asks for Elsa's blessing to marry Hans, but she refuses and criticizes her for engaging with someone she has just met. This raises an argument between the two with Anna losing her temper, culminating in Elsa <b>getting</b> <b>angry</b> and accidentally exposing her abilities. Upon the guests' (including Anna) horrified reactions, Elsa flees the castle in panic and goes into hiding in the icy mountains. During her retreat, she inadvertently unleashes an eternal winter throughout Arendelle. Far from there, Elsa decides to let go her powers and build an enormous ice palace. Anna, believing it's her fault, determines to find her sister and bring her back, leaving Hans in charge of Arendelle.|$|E
