5|$|After their victory, the Crusaders rested {{for a while}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> {{plain of}} Messenia. Champlitte called a council of war to {{determine}} their future strategy, and sent the fleet, which until then had accompanied them, home. In late 1205 or 1206, the Crusaders went on to capture Arkadia, whose siege lasted for some time, {{as well as the}} fortress of Araklovon, whose resistance was led by the celebrated warrior Doxapatres Voutsaras. By this time, the entire northern and western of the peninsula was under the rule of Champlitte. The northwest belonged to the Duchy of Athens under the suzerainty of Boniface of Montferrat, although Leo Sgouros and his men still held out in their two fortresses; and Laconia and the mountains of the Taygetus and Tsakonia remained still unsubdued. Nevertheless, the first stage of the Frankish conquest was complete, and in a letter to Pope Innocent III on 19 November 1205, Champlitte claimed for himself the title princeps totius Achaiae provincie, establishing a new state, the Principality of Achaea.|$|E
5|$|Subfossil {{deposits}} and midden remains {{suggest that the}} huia was once widespread in both lowland and montane native forest throughout the North Island, extending from the northernmost tip at Cape Reinga to Wellington and the Aorangi Range in the far south. Only a few huia are known from the extensive pitfall deposits in the karst of the Waitomo Caves area and they are also rare or absent in fossil deposits in the central North Island and Hawke's Bay; {{it seems to have}} preferred habitats that are not well sampled by the deposits known at present. Its range appears to have contracted following Māori settlement in the middle 12th century. By the time of European settlement in the 1840s, the bird was found only in the forests of the southern North Island, south of a line from the Raukumara Range in the east, across the Kaimanawa Range, to the Turakina River in the Rangitikei in the west. In the south, its range extended to the Wairarapa and the Rimutaka Range east of Wellington. Reports collected by Walter Buller and a single waiata (Māori song) suggest that the huia was once also found in the Marlborough and Nelson districts of the South Island; however, it has never been identified <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> fossil deposits south of Cook Strait, and there is no other evidence of the species' presence.|$|E
5|$|Zutphen was {{strategically}} {{important to}} Farnese, as it allowed his troops to levy war contributions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> Veluwe region. Therefore, he left some troops blockading Rheinberg and marched {{to relieve the}} town. He personally supplied Zutphen at first, but as the Anglo-Dutch siege continued, he assembled a large convoy whose delivery to the town he entrusted to the Alfonso Félix de Ávalos Aquino y Gonzaga, Marquis del Vasto/Guasto. Leicester learned of this when a courier dispatched by Farnese to Francisco Verdugo, {{the man in charge}} of Zutphen, was intercepted. The English and Dutch prepared an ambush, in which many English knights and noblemen were involved. In the end, the Spanish succeeded in delivering the convoy safely to Zutphen after a hard-fought battle. The Spanish cavalry, composed mainly of Italian and Albanian soldiers, was defeated by the English cavalry under the Earl of Essex. The Spanish infantry, however, held its ground and delivered the convoy to Zutphen. From there, reinforced by Verdugo, the Spanish troops forced the English to retreat.|$|E

40|$|Background High {{fertility}} and wide inequality in wealth distribution are phenomenal problems in sub-Saharan Africa. Modern Contraceptives (MC) {{are useful for}} limiting fertility, but are not always easily accessible in Malawi. This study examines <b>the</b> gap <b>in</b> MC use and fertility between women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>richest</b> and poorest Wealth Quintile (WQ). Methods The study was cross-sectional in design and utilized Malawi DHS dataset, 2010. It focused on women of reproductive age. The dependent variables are ever and current use of MC. Chi-square and multinomial logistic regression {{were used for the}} analysis. Results Mean children ever born by women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> poorest and <b>richest</b> WQs were 3. 94 [*]±[*] 2. 7 and 2. 82 [*]±[*] 2. 3 respectively (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). The adjusted total fertility rate (Adj. TFR) was higher among women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> poorest (Adj. TFR[*]=[*] 7. 60) WQ than <b>the</b> <b>richest</b> (Adj. TFR[*]=[*] 4. 45). The prevalence of ever use of MC was higher among women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>richest</b> WQ (82. 4 %) than the poorest (66. 8 %) (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Similar pattern exists for current use of MC; 58. 5 % and 45. 9 % for women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>richest</b> and poorest WQs respectively (p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>richest</b> WQ were more likely to ever use (OR[*]=[*] 2. 36; C. I[*]=[*] 2. 07 - 2. 69, p[*]<[*] 0. 001) and currently using (OR[*]=[*] 1. 66; C. I[*]=[*] 1. 40 - 1. 97, p[*]<[*] 0. 001) MC than their counterparts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> poorest WQ. Slight reduction in odd-ratio of MC use among women in richest WQ resulted when socio-demographic variables were used as control. Conclusion Fertility was higher and the use of MC was lower among women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> poorest than their counterparts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>richest</b> WQ. Ensuring availability of MC at little or no cost may bridge <b>the</b> gap <b>in</b> contraceptive use between women <b>in</b> <b>the</b> poorest and <b>richest</b> WQ in Malawi. [URL]...|$|R

25|$|As a flightless species <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> biozone of the African savanna, {{the common}} ostrich must face {{a variety of}} {{formidable}} predators throughout its life cycle. Animals that prey on ostriches of all ages may include cheetahs, lions, leopards, African hunting dogs, and spotted hyenas. Common ostriches can often outrun most of their predators in a pursuit, so most predators will try to ambush an unsuspecting bird using obstructing vegetation or other objects. A notable exception is the cheetah, {{which is the most}} prolific predator of adult common ostriches due to its own great running speeds.|$|E

Like their predecessors, they also hunted seals and fished <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> waters. North of the Kongemose people, lived other hunter-gatherers in most of southern Norway and Sweden, called the Nøstvet and Lihult cultures, descendants of the Fosna and Hensbacka cultures.

25|$|Even as America's westward {{expansion}} allowed over 400 {{million acres}} (1,600,000km²) of new land {{to be put}} under cultivation, between 1870 and 1910 the number of Americans involved in farming or farm labor dropped by a third. New farming techniques and agricultural mechanization facilitated both processes. Cyrus McCormick's reaper (invented in 1834) allowed farmers to quadruple their harvesting efficiency by replacing hand labor with a mechanical device. John Deere invented the steel plow in 1837, keeping the soil from sticking to the plow and {{making it easier to}} farm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rich</b> prairies of the Midwest. The harvester, self-binder, and combine allowed even greater efficiencies: wheat farmers in 1866 achieved an average yield of 9.9 bushels per acre but by 1898 yields had increased to 15.3 bushels per acre even as the total area had tripled.|$|E
