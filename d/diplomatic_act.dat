Paranhos, however, had preempted such an outcome. As retaliation for the bloodless conclusion, he was fired from his post. Returning to Brazil, he defended himself in the Senate: [...] "Say [...] whatever you want about the <b>diplomatic</b> <b>act</b> of 20 February; you will not be able to take away from me this grateful conviction: that through that solution I saved the life of 2,000 fellow compatriots, [...] avoided the destruction of an important capital".

6000|$|... (M3) On March 24 Cavour paid Napoleon {{a bitter}} price for his assent to annexation, by acquiescing in the cession to France of Savoy and Nice, provinces that were, {{one of them}} the cradle of the royal race, the other the birthplace of Garibaldi, {{the hero of the}} people. In this {{transaction}} the theory of the plébiscite, or direct popular vote upon a given question, for the first time found a place among the clauses of a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>act.</b> The plébiscite, though stigmatised as a hypocritical farce, and often no better than a formal homage paid by violence or intrigue to public right, was a derivative from the doctrines of nationality and the sovereignty of the people then ruling in Europe. The issue of the operation in Savoy and Nice was what had been anticipated. Italy bore the stroke with wise fortitude, but England when she saw the bargain closed for which she had herself prepared the way, took fierce umbrage at the aggrandisement of France, and heavy clouds floated into the European sky. As we have seen, the first act of the extraordinary drama closed at Villafranca. The curtain fell next at Florence upon the fusion of central with upper Italy. Piedmont, a secondary state, had now grown to be a kingdom with eleven or twelve millions of inhabitants. Greater things were yet to follow. Ten millions still remained in the south under the yoke of Bourbons and the Vatican. The third act, most romantic, most picturesque of all, an incomparable union of heroism with policy at double play with all the shifts of circumstance, opened a few weeks later.|$|E

50|$|Before {{the war in}} Western Armenia in 1877, General Lazarian {{made his}} name in the {{northern}} Caucasus. He was assigned, like many officers, to fight in the Murid War in Dagestan against the Imam Shamil. Lazarian, unlike most officers, took the time to study and learn the Tatar language. It was a language that was known throughout the Caucasus region by the peasants, and hence foot soldiers. With this knowledge {{he was the first to}} enter into negotiations with the Muslim rebels and was the one to set up the plans for the peace processes. In 1840 he was involved in the arrest of Hadji Murad. His crowning achievement in this theater was the talks he held with the defeated Shamil, whom he led to choose peace and surrender to the governing forces in 1859.

40|$|Throughout {{the first}} dynasty, the literati {{at the service}} of the Portuguese Crown played an {{increasingly}} important role in the assertion of royal power. They can be found serving the royal house as officers, representing the Portuguese kings in political and <b>diplomatic</b> <b>acts,</b> and even playing a wide range of other functions in the central administration: legal, medical, economic, administrative, etc. The presence of these elements next to the monarchs was felt since the foundation of the kingdom, but the corollary of this process occurred with the arrival of King Afonso III to the throne of Portugal. Thus, his circle of scholars constitutes an interesting case study to understand the notion of an aulic circle, the light of European values of the thirteenth century. At the same time, illustrates the paradigm of a well-oiled bureaucratic machine in search for a strong political centralization...|$|R

5000|$|The Munich Agreement, a <b>diplomatic</b> <b>act</b> of {{appeasement}} to {{the territorial}} demands of Hitler’s Germany, led Winston Churchill to articulate to the House of Commons how Britain’s display of weakness had upset {{the balance of}} continental power. In an effort to avoid war with Germany, the allies gave the Sudetenland, a large German part of Czechoslovakia, to Hitler’s growing Nazi empire. Churchill described the disastrous {{chain of events that}} would soon arise from the Prime Minister’s choice to acquiesce to Hitler’s demands and gave his recommendation of how to deal with a growingly belligerent German state. Churchill announced that The Munich Agreement had restructured the political landscape and history of Europe, forever altering the continent without a single drop of blood being shed. He went further, saying the fate of Czechoslovakia was the worst possible outcome and that Czech ties to the West and the League of Nations were the main cause of Czechoslovakia’s downfall. Churchill suggested, “Between submission and immediate war there was this third alternative, which gave a hope not only of peace but of justice.” The orator made the observation that the system of alliance that had allowed France to maintain a balance of power was gone. The consequences of The Munich Agreement meant that the smaller nations of Europe had to answer to Germany, which now had access and influence deep into the east. Already, Churchill saw the lands of Poland, Rumania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia as future victims of German conquests. Churchill’s speech was a wake-up call to British parliament, a passive group led by Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. Churchill argued that the Prime Minister’s approval of the Munich Agreement came out of a powerful desire to avoid another worldwide conflagration. Using Wilsonian language, Churchill argues “liberal and democratic” nations must defend the principle of self-determination from being perverted by totalitarian governments. Churchill saw The Munich Agreement as a culmination of five years of retreat from global responsibility and believed that Great Britain and France would pay the price. Churchill believed Germany would soon demand more democratic land and the Allies would need to reverse their strategy of appeasement against Germany. With German rapidly rearming and Russia out of European balance of power, Churchill predicted that Hitler would next turn towards Western Europe in search of land and resources. While Prime Minister Chamberlain believed Czechoslovakia would face the consequences of The Munich Agreement, Churchill argued that Britain and France would be the countries to feel the aftermath. Early in his speech, Churchill declared, “I have always held the view that the maintenance of peace depends upon the accumulation of deterrents against the aggressor…”. [...] Churchill said it was time to claim air superiority and create a system of alliances against Germany while building up the entire British military, suggestions that had been made in vain until after the Munich Crisis. Churchill’s militant-desires are systemic from his disapproval of The Munich Agreement, claiming Britain’s act of appeasement would start an unending desire for more land from Germany.|$|E
40|$|During {{the early}} Middle Ages in Western Europe, charity practice, the pro anima {{donations}} and alms given to churches and monasteries, had {{at its heart}} a complex system of historically defined representations in which the Eucharistic offering stood for {{a model of the}} exchanges between men and God. This system of representation evolved in three discrete periods of time, as we see through an exploration of writings on the doctrine of almsgiving and of epigraphic inscriptions and <b>diplomatic</b> <b>acts</b> from the fourth through the ninth centuries. From the fourth to the sixth century, the doctrine of almsgiving developed {{as a result of the}} creation of the social category of the poor, an evolution that affected the behaviour of the aristocracy. Following this development, in the seventh and eighth centuries, as the amount of alms and gifts made to churches and monasteries increased, the clergy progressively established itself as the mediator in the exchanges between men and God. Finally, the Carolingian shift of the ninth century heralded the expansion of the seigniorial age, when the relation between the earth and heaven began to be seen as a mystery similar to that of the Eucharist...|$|R

5000|$|The Treaty of Sèvres imposed harsh terms upon Turkey {{and placed}} most of Anatolia under Allied and Greek control. Sultan Mehmet VI's {{acceptance}} of the treaty angered Turkish nationalists, who established a rival government at Ankara and reorganized Turkish forces {{with the aim of}} blocking the implementation of the treaty. By the fall of 1922, the Ankara-based government had secured most of Turkey's borders and replaced the fading Ottoman Sultanate as the dominant governing entity in Anatolia. In light of these events, a peace conference was convened at Lausanne, Switzerland in order to draft a new treaty to replace the Treaty of Sèvres. Invitations to participate in the conference were extended to both the Ankara-based government and the Istanbul-based Ottoman government, but the abolition of the Sultanate by the Ankara-based government on 1 November 1922 and the subsequent departure of Sultan Mehmet VI from Turkey left the Ankara-based government as the sole governing entity in Anatolia. The Ankara-based government, led by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, moved swiftly to implement its nationalist programme, which did not allow for the presence of significant non-Turkish minorities in Western Anatolia. In one of his first <b>diplomatic</b> <b>acts</b> as the sole governing representative of Turkey, Atatürk negotiated and signed the [...] "Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations" [...] on 30 January 1923 with Eleftherios Venizelos and the government of Greece.

5000|$|In the United States, the <b>Diplomatic</b> Relations <b>Act</b> of 1978 ( [...] et seq.) {{follows the}} {{principles}} {{introduced by the}} Vienna Conventions.

If the United States were to punish a visiting diplomat without sufficient grounds, U.S. representatives in other countries could receive harsher treatment. If a person with immunity is alleged to have committed a crime or faces a civil lawsuit, the State Department asks the home country to waive immunity of the alleged offender so that the complaint can be moved to the courts. If immunity is not waived, prosecution cannot be undertaken. However, the State Department still has the right to expel the diplomat. In many such cases, the diplomat's visas are canceled, and he and his family may be barred from returning to the United States. Crimes committed by members of a diplomat's family can also result in dismissal.|$|R

50|$|Native American tribes {{consider}} {{the presentation of}} an eagle feather {{to be one of}} their highest marks of respect.

The esteem attached to eagle feathers was so high that in many cases, such as a warrior (e.g. Dog Soldiers of the Cheyenne), only two or three honour feathers might be awarded in their whole lifetime. Historically, the warrior who was the first to touch an enemy in battle and escape unscathed received an eagle feather. When enough feathers were collected, they might be incorporated into a headdress or some other form of worn regalia. Headdresses were usually reserved exclusively for the tribe's chosen political and spiritual leaders.|$|R
