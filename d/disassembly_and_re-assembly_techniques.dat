40|$|Type VI {{secretion}} {{systems are}} bacterial virulence-associated nanomachines composed of proteins that are evolutionarily related to components of bacteriophage tails. Here {{we show that}} protein secretion by the type VI secretion system of Vibrio cholerae requires the action of a dynamic intracellular tubular structure that is structurally and functionally homologous to contractile phage tail sheath. Time-lapse fluorescence light microscopy reveals that sheaths of the type VI secretion system cycle between assembly, quick contraction, <b>disassembly</b> <b>and</b> <b>re-assembly.</b> Whole-cell electron cryotomography further shows that the sheaths appear as long tubular structures in either extended or contracted conformations that {{are connected to the}} inner membrane by a distinct basal structure. These data support a model in which the contraction of the type VI secretion system sheath provides the energy needed to translocate proteins out of effector cells and into adjacent target cells...|$|R
50|$|The Astra 600/43, {{as is true}} {{with the}} vast {{majority}} of handgun designs, continues to be carried to a very limited degree by civilians. Many were imported into the USA and sold to the public, where they still see some use. The design is generally considered ugly and antiquated in its appearance and its method of <b>disassembly</b> <b>and</b> <b>re-assembly</b> for cleaning is often intimidating. Despite this, the weapon is designed well in terms of safety, durability, reliability, accuracy and (surprisingly to many due to its awkward appearance), ergonomics. The cartridge it fires is reasonably powerful and widely available globally, and {{as is the case with}} many early 20th century guns, production costs to manufacture faithful new copies of the design would be prohibitively expensive due to machine time and the use of large amounts of expensive steel.|$|R
40|$|Plants {{have evolved}} highly {{sophisticated}} mechanisms of self-repair to regenerate proteins that become photo-damaged over time. Key to this self-repair {{process is the}} reversible self-assembly of protein complexes, which {{is characterized by the}} molecular recognition of parts, kinetic trapping of meta-stable thermodynamic states, and chemical signaling to switch between states. In this thesis, we mimic such regenerative mechanisms in an effort to develop biological light-harvesting devices with prolonged lifetimes. We demonstrate the first synthetic photoelectrochemical cell capable of mimicking key aspects of the self-repair process. Surfactant addition and removal was used to signal between the <b>disassembly</b> <b>and</b> <b>re-assembly</b> of a photoactive complex demonstrating photo-conversion efficiencies of 40 %. These dynamic complexes consist of lipid bilayer disks housing photoactive reaction centers (RCs) that align along the length of a single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT). Application of a regeneration cycle that reversibly signals between the assembled and disassembled states extends the lifetime of the photoelectrochemical cell indefinitely and increases cell efficiency by over 300 % over 168 hours...|$|R
40|$|International audienceX-ray {{crystallography}} {{studies as}} well as live-cell fluorescent imaging have recently challenged the traditional view of Protein-kinase CK 2. Unbalanced expression of catalytic and regulatory CK 2 subunits has been observed {{in a variety of}} tissues and tumors. Thus, the potential intersubunit flexibility suggested by these studies raises the likely prospect that the CK 2 holoenzyme complex is subject to <b>disassembly</b> <b>and</b> <b>re-assembly.</b> In this study, we show evidence for the reversible multimeric organization of the CK 2 holoenzyme complex in vitro. We used a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, binding experiments and functional assays to show that both in vitro and in vivo, only a small set of primary hydrophobic residues of CK 2 β which contacts {{at the center of the}} CK 2 α/CK 2 β interface dominates affinity. The results indicate that a double mutation in CK 2 β of amino acids - Y 188 and F 190 - which are complementary and fill up a hydrophobic pocket of CK 2 α is the most disruptive to CK 2 α binding both in vitro and in living cells. Further characterization of hot spots in a cluster of hydrophobic amino acids centered around Y 188 -F 190 led us to the structure-based design of small peptide inhibitors. One conformationally constrained 11 -mer peptide (Pc) represents a unique CK 2 β-based small molecule that was particularly efficient 1) to antagonize the interaction between the CK 2 subunits, 2) to inhibit the assembly of the CK 2 holoenzyme complex, 3) to strongly affect its substrate preference...|$|R
40|$|Efficient {{transmissions}} {{systems are}} key to producing competitive motor vehicles that have a smaller environmental impact. Gears are the main components in vehicle transmissions and although they are already highly efficient, there is still room for improvement. In this study, the focus falls on the lubricant used to create separating films between gears and todissipate heat. When driving, the gears churn this lubricant, giving rise to power losses {{that are related to}} the amount and properties of the lubricant. However, any attempt to reduce these losses must not compromise the required lubrication and heat dissipation. Paper A reports on the use of an FZG gear test rig to investigate power losses and heat generation for different gear immersion depths, surface roughness and coatings. The results show that lower gear roughness reduces gear mesh losses and heat generation. A polishing affect was obtained when a non-coated gear ran against a coated gear. The aim of the research reported in paper B was to increase the accuracy of efficiency testing. It investigated how <b>and</b> whether repeated <b>disassembly</b> <b>and</b> <b>re-assembly</b> of the same test equipment, as well as test performance and rig conditions, affect the measured torque loss in an FZG gear test rig. It was shown that the measured torque loss changes between one assembly and another. Repeatability between tests is crucial for accurate conclusions. The aim of the research reported in paper C was to study whether gear efficiency could be increased by a running-in procedure, which would reduce the need for a coolant. A back-to-back gear test rig was used to test two running-in loads. Higher gear mesh efficiency was seen when a higher running-in load was used. QC 20141006 </p...|$|R
40|$|The BH 3 -only protein Bid plays a {{key role}} in the {{induction}} of mitochondrial apoptosis, but its mechanism of action is still not completely understood. Here we studied the two main activation events of Bid: Caspase- 8 cleavage and interaction with the membrane bilayer. We found a striking reversible behaviour of the dissociation-association events between the Bid fragments p 15 and p 7. Caspase- 8 cleavage does not induce per se separation of the two Bid fragments, which remain in a stable complex resembling the full length Bid. Detergents trigger a complete dissociation, which can be fully reversed by detergent removal in a range of protein concentrations from 100 µM down to 500 nM. Incubation of cBid with cardiolipin-containing liposomes leads to partial dissociation of the complex. Only p 15 (tBid) fragments are found at the membrane, while p 7 shows no tendency to interact with the bilayer, but complete removal of p 7 strongly increases the propensity of tBid to become membrane-associated. Despite the striking structural similarities of inactive Bid and Bax, Bid does not form oligomers and reacts differently in the presence of detergents and membranes, highlighting clear differences in the modes of action of the two proteins. The partial dissociation of cBid triggered by the membrane is suggested to depend on the strong and specific interaction between p 15 and p 7. The reversible <b>disassembly</b> <b>and</b> <b>re-assembly</b> of the cBid molecules at the membrane was as well proven by EPR using spin labeled cBid in the presence of isolated mitochondria. The observed dynamic dissociation of the two Bid fragments could allow the assistance to the pore-forming Bax to occur repeatedly and may explain the proposed "hit-and-run" mode of action of Bid at the bilayer...|$|R
40|$|Flow-induced {{changes in}} {{confluent}} human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) monolayers were studied using a parallel-plate flow system. Static-cultured endothelial cells, in monolayers, are polygonal in shape. When exposed to shear stress, HUVEC aligned and elongated {{parallel to the}} direction of flow. We postulated that the interendothelial cell junctions would remodel in response to continuous fluid shear stress. Shear stress-induced morphological reorganization of the F-actin cytoskeleton is synchronized with the remodeling of the adherens junctions. These junctions are comprised of VE-cadherin and associated a -catenin, b -catenin, g -catenin and p 120 -catenin. Under static conditions, the junctional VE-cadherin complexes in HUVEC form intricate, three-dimensional lattice-like structures. Over a time course of exposure to shear stress these intricate structures are remodeled into compact, uniform cell-cell junctions that outline cell contours. Immunoblot analyses of differential detergent extracts prepared from HUVEC monolayers {{were used to determine}} whether the expression and cytoskeletal association of the VE-cadherin complex proteins changed in response to shear stress. The quantities of VE-cadherin and a -catenin increased in the cytoskeletal fractions from sheared HUVEC, suggesting that there was increased cell-cell junctional stability in endothelial cells exposed to continuous fluid shear stress. Shear stress stimulated increased tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin-associated b -catenin, g -catenin and p 120 -catenin, possibly dynamically modulating the <b>disassembly</b> <b>and</b> <b>re-assembly</b> of cadherin complexes during junctional remodeling. Such changes in tyrosine phosphorylation are regulated by the integrated actions of protein tyrosine kinases and phosphatases. In static-cultured HUVEC, SHP 2, an intracellular protein tyrosine phosphatase, co-precipitated with VE-cadherin-associated b -catenin. The association between SHP 2 and VE-cadherin complexes was greatly diminished in extracts from cells exposed to fluid shear stress. Shear-induced increases of tyrosine phosphorylation in the VE-cadherin complex correlated with the loss of SHP 2 from the adherens junctions. This implicates SHP 2 as part of the kinase/phosphatase mechanism that regulates the remodeling of the adherens junctions during endothelial cell adaptation to fluid shear stress. The shear-mediated dissociation of SHP 2 from VE-cadherin complexes also correlated with an increased association of SHP 2 with PECAM- 1. Thus, in endothelial cells fluid shear stress appears to regulate SHP 2 association with its junctional protein partners as HUVEC dramatically remodeled their cell-cell junctions. ...|$|R

In {{addition to this}} net synthesis, oxygenic photoautotrophs must counter the light-dependent photoinactivation of Photosystem II (PSII), using metabolically expensive proteolysis, <b>disassembly,</b> resynthesis <b>and</b> <b>re-assembly</b> of protein subunits. We used growth rates, elemental analyses and protein quantitations to estimate the nitrogen (N) metabolism costs to both accumulate the photosynthetic system and to maintain PSII function in the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana, growing at two pCO 2 levels {{across a range of}} light levels. The photosynthetic system contains c. 15 - 25 % of total cellular N. Under low growth light, N (re) cycling through PSII repair is only c. 1 % of the cellular N assimilation rate. As growth light increases to inhibitory levels, N metabolite cycling through PSII repair increases to c. 14 % of the cellular N assimilation rate. Cells growing under the assumed future 750 ppmv pCO 2 show higher growth rates under optimal light, coinciding with a lowered N metabolic cost to maintain photosynthesis, but then suffer greater photoinhibition of growth under excess light, coincident with rising costs to maintain photosynthesis. We predict this quantitative trait response to light will vary across taxa...|$|R

40|$|Many {{cellular}} proteins exist as homo-oligomers. The {{mechanism of the}} assembly process of such proteins is still poorly understood. We have previously observed that Hsp 16. 3, a protein exhibiting chaperone-like activity, undergoes stepwise <b>disassembly</b> <b>and</b> nonstepwise reassembly. Here, the <b>disassembly</b> <b>and</b> reassembly of a nonchaperone protein RbsD, from Escherichia coli, was studied in vitro.

Disassembly RbsD intermediates including pentamers, tetramers, trimers, dimers, and monomers were detected by using urea-containing pore gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, while only pentamers were detected for its reassembly. The observation of stepwise <b>disassembly</b> <b>and</b> apparent nonstepwise reassembly for both a chaperone protein (Hsp 16. 3) and a nonchaperone protein (RbsD) strongly suggests that such a feature is most likely general for homo-oligomeric proteins...|$|R
