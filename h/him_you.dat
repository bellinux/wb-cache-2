5|$|I fell in {{love with}} him as a ten-year-old boy. I saw him in a play in New York... a very well-staged melodrama which was an {{enormous}} hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies—little things. And I could never forget that performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for <b>him.</b> <b>You</b> play next to him and you just feel the thing that you do with a big actor—this dynamo going on.|$|E
5|$|He {{had been}} hit by a {{marksman}} from the Redoutable, firing at a range of 50feet (15m). The bullet had entered his left shoulder, passed through his spine at the sixth and seventh thoracic vertebrae, and lodged two inches (5cm) below his right shoulder blade in the muscles of his back. Nelson was carried below by sergeant-major of marines Robert Adair and two seamen. As he was being carried down, he asked them to pause while he gave some advice to a midshipman on the handling of the tiller. He then draped a handkerchief over his face to avoid causing alarm amongst the crew. He was taken to the surgeon William Beatty, telling <b>him</b> <b>You</b> can do nothing for me. I have but a short time to live. My back is shot through. Nelson was made comfortable, fanned and brought lemonade and watered wine to drink after he complained of feeling hot and thirsty. He asked several times to see Hardy, who was on deck supervising the battle, and asked Beatty to remember him to Emma, his daughter and his friends.|$|E
5|$|There {{are those}} who will {{consider}} it their duty, as friends of the Negro people, to tell us to revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save ourselves by writing {{him out of the}} history of our turbulent times. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew <b>him</b> <b>you</b> would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.|$|E

25|$|I am {{sent here}} as a peace chief; all here is to be peace, but north of the Arkansas is General Sheridan, the great war chief, and I do not control him; and {{he has all the}} {{soldiers}} who are fighting the Arapahoes and Cheyennes. Therefore, you must go back to your country, and if the soldiers come to fight, you must remember they are not from me, but from that great war chief, and with <b>him</b> <b>you</b> must make peace.|$|E

500|$|Actor Stephen Lang portrayed Pickett in the 1993 film Gettysburg. Billy Campbell portrayed {{him in the}} 2003 prequel Gods and Generals. In a 2003 interview, Lang {{commented that}} [...] "for all of Pickett's flamboyance, there's {{something}} organically sad about him. Have you ever looked {{at any of the}} portraits of <b>him?</b> <b>You</b> can see it in his eyes-the sadness. He could be charming, but it was tinged with sadness." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I don’t {{think that}} I have done enough events {{to win the}} rally just by driving skill, for instance. If I win, {{it will be because}} I {{have a little bit of}} luck and some of the others have trouble. I mean, Hannu Mikkola knows the forests like the back of his hand so there is no use trying to drive to beat <b>him.</b> <b>You</b> have to wait for him to have trouble. Then you are in with a chance." ...|$|E
500|$|The first aria, [...] "" [...] (In <b>Him</b> <b>you</b> can dare all), {{depicts a}} [...] "hunting scene" [...] for bass and strings. Bach {{plays on the}} double meaning of the German word [...] "", which in the text has the sense [...] "achieve by great exertion", but he expresses the word's literal meaning ("to hunt") by an [...] "outrageous hunting call trill" [...] of the bass. This aria and those {{following}} are not da capo arias, but follow the bar form of the poem as bipartite structures.|$|E

500|$|During the {{development}} of Street Fighter III, fans discussed {{the prospect of the}} character's inclusion in the new title. EGM perpetuated the hoax again in 1997 by claiming that Sheng Long was in the game, providing character artwork depicting his appearance and new screenshots. Unlike the first article, they did not finish their explanation of how to reach him, ending the article with [...] "To reach <b>him,</b> <b>you</b> will need at least six perfects and..." [...] Additionally, the words [...] "April Fools" [...] were spelled out in the first letter of the first ten sentences of the article.|$|E
500|$|Almost {{four weeks}} later, Locke {{experiences}} a self-induced hallucination, where a longer-haired Boone appears and pushes Locke {{around in a}} wheelchair in an imaginary Sydney International Airport, where the other survivors are present but acting in different roles. [...] Boone tells Locke someone in the airport was in serious danger. Close {{to the end of}} the hallucination, Locke finds Eko's stick covered in blood and Boone appears bloody and injured. He tells Locke [...] "They've got <b>him.</b> <b>You</b> don't have much time." [...] In the Oceanic Six's cover story, Boone was one of the ones who survived the initial crash, but soon died of internal injuries.|$|E
500|$|Lennon {{stated that}} his {{relationship}} with Harrison was [...] "one of young follower and older guy... was like a disciple of mine when we started." [...] The two later bonded over their LSD experiences, finding common ground as seekers of spirituality. They took radically different paths thereafter, Harrison finding God and Lennon coming {{to the conclusion that}} people are the creators of their own lives. In 1974 Harrison said of his former bandmate: [...] "John Lennon is a saint and he's heavy-duty, and he's great and I love him. But at the same time, he's such a bastard – but that's the great thing about <b>him,</b> <b>you</b> see?" ...|$|E

500|$|Contradicting his {{personality}} {{with that of}} his role in The Hangover Trilogy, director Todd Phillips describes him as [...] "ridiculously different in real life. He is very vulnerable — insecure {{is not the right}} word... And there's a warmth to <b>him</b> <b>you</b> would never know." [...] A writer for International Business Times adds that Cooper, despite being in his 40s, has a [...] "boyish charm and laid-back personality." [...] Cooper believes that {{his personality}} relates to acting: [...] "I enjoy people, that makes this profession a lot easier, and I can sleep anywhere. That's a skill." [...] He cites actor Daniel Day-Lewis, who he thinks is [...] "the world's greatest actor", as an influence.|$|E
500|$|But Eustace Roskill {{cautions}} that [...] "It {{would be wrong}} to judge Stevenson simply by the notoriety of a few cases.... he showed great mercy to those whom he saw to be victims rather than aggressors." [...] In the early 1970s, while conducting training sessions in sentencing for newly appointed recorders, Stevenson summed up his attitude: [...] "You sentence off the top of your head. If the man's a shit, down he goes. If there's {{something to be said for}} <b>him,</b> <b>you</b> do your best not to put him inside." [...] Despite his stern and authoritarian reputation, in the 1970s he sometimes submitted letters to the Court of Appeal supporting the reduction of his sentences.|$|E
500|$|Eric Zumbrunnen and Jeff Buchanan {{served as}} the film's editors. Zumbrunnen stated that there was [...] "rewriting" [...] in a scene between Theodore and Samantha, after Theodore goes on a blind date. He {{explained}} that their goal in the scene was {{to make it clear}} that [...] " [...] was connecting with [...] and feeling for <b>him.</b> <b>You</b> wanted to get the sense that the conversation was drawing them closer". Steven Soderbergh became involved in the film when Jonze's original cut ran over 150 minutes, and Soderbergh cut it down to 90 minutes. This was not the final version of the film, but it assisted Jonze in removing unnecessary sub-plots. Consequently, a supporting character played by Chris Cooper that was the subject of a documentary within the film was removed from the final cut.|$|E

6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] said Mrs. Easterfield. [...] "After {{what you}} told me about <b>him,</b> I {{expected}} <b>you</b> would recognize <b>him</b> the moment <b>you</b> saw <b>him.</b> But <b>you</b> did not know him; you did not do anything I expected you to do; and I was very much disappointed." ...|$|R

500|$|Campbell {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} {{as one of}} the best power running backs in NFL history, and was highly regarded by his peers. [...] "Every time you hit <b>him</b> <b>you</b> lower your own IQ," [...] said Redskins linebacker Pete Wysocki. Cornerback Lester Hayes of the Raiders said [...] "Earl Campbell was put on this earth to play football." [...] Cliff Harris, safety for the Cowboys, recalled Campbell as [...] "the hardest-hitting running back I ever played against. He didn't have the elusiveness of an O. J. Simpson. But when you finished a game against Earl, you had to sit in a tub with Epsom salts." [...] Bum Phillips, when asked if Campbell was in a class by himself, quipped, [...] "I dunno. But if he ain't, it don't take long to call the roll." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2012, Anthony {{takes an}} {{interest}} to Amira Masood (Preeya Kalidas), Amira states in EastEnders to Zainab Masood (Nina Wadia) that Anthony 'brightens up her life by treating {{her like a}} princess'. Speaking {{of his relationship with}} Amira, Lapinskas told Digital Spy, [...] "From the very first time Anthony saw Amira at the pub, he said she was a goddess. Since then, he's been helping her out a bit, and she's warming to <b>him.</b> <b>You</b> never know what could happen– watch this space. It could turn into something beautiful! He added, [...] "I think at first she might have wanted to use him to make Syed (Marc Elliot) jealous, but over a period of time, she might start warming to him. He is genuinely a nice guy and quite charming, so she could fall for him".|$|E
500|$|In 352BC, Athenian troops {{successfully}} opposed Philip at Thermopylae,* E. M. Burke, [...] "The Early Political Speeches of Demosthenes", 184 (note 92). but the Macedonian {{victory over}} the Phocians at the Battle of Crocus Field shook Demosthenes. In 351BC, Demosthenes felt strong enough to express his view concerning the most important foreign policy issue facing Athens at that time: the stance his city should take towards Philip. According to Jacqueline de Romilly, a French philologist {{and member of the}} Académie française, the threat of Philip would give Demosthenes' stances a focus and a raison d'être (reason for existence). Demosthenes saw the king of Macedon as a menace to the autonomy of all Greek cities and yet he presented him as a monster of Athens's own creation; in the First Philippic he reprimanded his fellow citizens as follows: [...] "Even if something happens to <b>him,</b> <b>you</b> will soon raise up a second Philip [...] ".* G. Kennedy, [...] "Oratory", 519–520.|$|E
