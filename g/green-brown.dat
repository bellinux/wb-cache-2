5|$|Hazel: The {{daughter}} of the two lead characters, born in the first issue, who occasionally narrates the series. She has wings like her mother, horns like her father, and <b>green-brown</b> eyes unlike those of either of her parents. She spends most of her childhood {{growing up in the}} organic tree-like rocketship with which she and her parents escape Cleave. She is seen taking her first steps {{at the end of the}} third story arc, and is speaking in simple phrases by the beginning of the fourth. She celebrates her fourth birthday in the sixth story arc, during a part of her life when she and her grandmother are being held in a Landfallian detention center.|$|E
25|$|The {{false scad}} is a blueish green to olive <b>green-brown</b> above fading to silvery white below, {{often with a}} narrow yellow stripe running from the head {{to the base of}} the caudal fin. The fins are hyaline to dusky with the {{exception}} of the caudal fin which is yellow. The second dorsal fin's lobe has a black blotch and narrow pale border at the tip. A black blotch is also present on the operculum.|$|E
25|$|Pumice is {{composed}} of highly microvesicular glass pyroclastic with very thin, translucent bubble walls of extrusive igneous rock. It is commonly, but not exclusively of silicic or felsic to intermediate in composition (e.g., rhyolitic, dacitic, andesite, pantellerite, phonolite, trachyte), but basaltic and other compositions are known. Pumice is commonly pale in color, ranging from white, cream, blue or grey, to <b>green-brown</b> or black. It forms when volcanic gases exsolving from viscous magma form bubbles that remain within the viscous magma as it cools to glass. Pumice is a common product of explosive eruptions (plinian and ignimbrite-forming) and commonly forms zones in upper parts of silicic lavas. Pumice has an average porosity of 90%, and initially floats on water.|$|E
25|$|The {{body is a}} sandy brown to {{olive green}} colour above, while the sides and lower body are a silvery brown to cream-white hue. The head is dark olive brown to greenish above, while the cheeks and opercles are golden-green, with a dark blotch on the opercle of some individuals. The trumpeter whiting is usually easy to {{distinguish}} by its characteristic dark brown irregular blotches present {{on the side of}} the fish, as well as a golden silver longitudinal band. The spinous dorsal fin is whitish, with a mottled olive green and brown texture. The soft dorsal fin has about five rows of brownish green spots. The anal and ventral fins are golden to yellow with cream margins, while the pectoral fins are yellow to pale yellow-green, with a distinct black-blue spot at the base. The caudal fin is olive brown to a darkish <b>green-brown</b> with darker margins.|$|E
25|$|The wels catfish's mouth {{contains}} {{lines of}} numerous small teeth, two long barbels {{on the upper}} jaw and four shorter barbels on the lower jaw. It has a long anal fin that extends to the caudal fin, and a small sharp dorsal fin relatively far forward. It relies largely on hearing and smell for hunting prey, but its eyes have a tapetum lucidum, providing the advantage of night vision, {{contrary to popular belief}} that the wels has poor eyesight. With its sharp pectoral fins, it creates an eddy to disorient its victim, which the predator sucks into its mouth and swallows whole. The skin is very slimy. Skin colour varies with environment. Clear water will give the fish a black color, while muddy water will often tend to produce <b>green-brown</b> specimens. The underside is always pale yellow to white in colour. Albinistic specimens are known to exist and are caught occasionally. The wels swims by undulating its long, muscular tail in a wave-like action, similar to crocodilians. They can also swim backwards.|$|E
500|$|A.latipennis larvae vary in {{size and}} colour during growth, but can be grouped small and large. The small {{caterpillars}} are generally [...] long and an overall milky grey, with a light brown head capsule that is about [...] wide. Large caterpillars may be milky grey or a dark <b>green-brown,</b> [...] long, with a [...] wide brown head capsule.|$|E
500|$|Next below {{these is}} the late Devonian and early Mississippian Huntley Mountain Formation, which is made of grayish-red shale and olive-gray sandstone. This is {{relatively}} hard rock and forms many of the ridges. Below this is the red shale and siltstone of the Catskill Formation, about [...] thick and some 375million years old. This layer is relatively soft and easily eroded, which helped to form the Pine Creek Gorge. Cliffs formed by the Huntley Mountain and Catskill formations are visible north of the park at Barbour Rock. The lowest and oldest layer is the Lock Haven Formation, which is gray to <b>green-brown</b> siltstone and shale over 400million years old. It forms {{the base of the}} gorge, contains marine fossils, and is up to [...] thick.|$|E
500|$|The three re-emerge {{from the}} glacier as {{primitive}} hominids, their clothes ripped away to reveal loincloths. They continue to walk backwards {{with a more}} simian gait, and soon turn into chimpanzees. From there, they are transformed {{into a number of}} different species in quick succession, including flying squirrels, furry mammals, aquatic mammals, fish, flightless birds, small dinosaurs, and burrowing lizard-like creatures. The environment around them changes rapidly as they travel, with cutaways showing millions of years of geological changes occurring in less than a few seconds. Finally, the three become mudskippers around a <b>green-brown</b> puddle. The action briefly moves forward again to show the middle character registering his disgust at the taste of the water with a [...] "Pweugh!" [...] sound. The commercial ends with a transition to a product shot of three pints of Guinness accompanied by the strapline [...] "Good things come to those who wait".|$|E
500|$|Amanita sinicoflava (occurring in North America) looks quite similar, {{but it has}} a sack-like volva, unlike A.ceciliae. A.antillana, of the Antilles islands, is {{somewhat}} the same, but it has ellipsoid spores unlike the spherical ones of A.ceciliae. A.ceciliae is often used as a misnomer for A.borealisorora, which largely occurs in North America. A.borealisorora is a provisional name, and the species has not yet been validly published. The spores of A.ceciliae highly resemble those of A.cinctipes (mainly found in Singapore), though the former has larger spores. The discolouration in the volva of A.colombiana (from Colombia, as its name states) probably shows a relationship between the mushroom and A.ceciliae. A.sorocula is another lookalike. This Colombian and Mesoamerican species is often mistaken for A.ceciliae, as both mushrooms have a volva with a weak structure and greying gills. [...] The notable difference is the strong yellow colour of the cap in immature A.ceciliae mushrooms. A.sorocula is not yet validly published, and currently is a newly accepted name. The Chinese species A.liquii is similar but the yellow-brown, red-brown or <b>green-brown</b> coloured cap of A.ceciliae are much different from the brown-black cap of A.liquii. Also, the volval remnants of A.ceciliae converge at the base to form a ring-like zone, unlike A.liquii. Apart from this, the cellular pigments in the sterile strip around the gills and volval remnants are much darker in colour compared to A.ceciliae.|$|E
60|$|Another member read to {{the club}} an account of his journey to Lochnagar, which was {{afterwards}} published in Chambers's Journal. He was celebrated for his descriptions of scenery, and {{was not the only}} member of the club whose essays got into print. More memorable perhaps was an itinerant match-seller known to Thrums and the surrounding towns as the literary spunk-seller. He was a wizened, shivering old man, often bare-footed, wearing at the best a thin ragged coat that had been black but was <b>green-brown</b> with age, and he made his spunks as well as sold them. He brought Bacon and Adam Smith into Thrums, and he loved to recite long screeds from Spenser, with a running commentary on the versification and the luxuriance of the diction. Of Jamie's death I do not care to write. He went without many a dinner in order to buy a book.|$|E
60|$|The dark storm cloud {{with its}} white, ragged ropes of {{lightning}} and down-streaming gray veils of rain, the purple gulf rolling like a colored sea to the dim mountains, the glorious golden {{light of the}} sun--these had enchanted {{her eyes with her}} beauty of the universe. They had burst the windows of her blindness. When she crawled into the <b>green-brown</b> covert it was to escape too great perception. She needed to be encompassed by close, tangible things. And there her body paid the tribute to the realization of life. Shock, convulsion, pain, relaxation, and then unutterable and insupportable sensing of her environment and the heart! In one way she was a wild animal alone in the woods, forced into the mating that meant reproduction of its kind. In another she was an infinitely higher being shot through and through with the most resistless and mysterious transport that life could give to flesh.|$|E
60|$|Then Hill, {{who was a}} burly, {{powerful}} man, made a strenuous effort, {{and rose}} almost to a standing position. He lifted his arm, indeed, clean out of the water. Hanging to it was a complicated tangle of brown ropes, and the eyes {{of one of the}} brutes that had hold of him, glaring straight and resolute, showed momentarily above the surface. The boat heeled more and more, and the <b>green-brown</b> water came pouring in a cascade over the side. Then Hill slipped and fell with his ribs across the side, and his arm and the mass of tentacles about it splashed back into the water. He rolled over; his boot kicked Mr. Fison's knee as that gentleman rushed forward to seize him, and in another moment fresh tentacles had whipped about his waist and neck, and after a brief, convulsive struggle, in which the boat was nearly capsized, Hill was lugged overboard. The boat righted with a violent jerk that all but sent Mr. Fison over the other side, and hid the struggle in the water from his eyes.|$|E
60|$|January 4th.--A {{drive with}} A. out of Porta San Giovanni and along Via Appia Nuova. More and more {{beautiful}} {{as you get}} {{well away from the}} walls and the great view opens out before you- -the rolling <b>green-brown</b> dells and flats of the Campagna, the long, disjointed arcade of the aqueducts, the deep-shadowed blue of the Alban Hills, touched into pale lights by their scattered towns. We stopped at the ruined basilica of San Stefano, an affair of the fifth century, rather meaningless without a learned companion. But the perfect little sepulchral chambers of the Pancratii, disinterred beneath the church, tell their own tale-- in their hardly dimmed frescoes, their beautiful sculptured coffin and great sepulchral slab. Better still the tomb of the Valerii adjoining it--a single chamber with an arched roof, covered with stucco mouldings perfectly intact, exquisite figures and arabesques as sharp and delicate as if the plasterer's scaffold had just been taken from under them. Strange enough to think of these things--so many of them as there are--surviving their immemorial eclipse in this perfect shape and coming up like long-lost divers on the sea of time.|$|E
6000|$|At 7.30 A.M. on {{the next}} day the loads were placed upon the crew's heads, and we made for the village, where the boat was still drawn up. The [...] "monoxyle" [...] was full of <b>green-brown</b> rain water, the oar-pins were {{represented}} by bits of stick, and all the furniture was wanting. After a time, the owner, duly summoned, stalked down from his hut, and began remarking that there was still a [...] "palaver" [...] on the stocks. I replied by paying him his money, and ordering the craft to be baled and launched. It was a spectacle to see the bushmen lying upon their bellies, kicking their heels in the air, and yep-yep-yeping uproariously when Forteune, their master, begged of them to bear a hand. Dean Presto might have borrowed from them a hint for his Yahoos. The threat to empty the Alugu (rum) upon the sand was efficacious. One by one they rose to work, and in the slowest possible way were produced five oars, of which one was sprung, a ricketty rudder, a huge mast, and a sail composed half of matting and half of holes. At the last moment, the men found that they had no [...] "chop;" [...] a franc produced two bundles of sweet manioc, good travelling food, as it can be eaten raw, but about as nutritious as Norwegian bark. At the last, last moment, Lángobúmo, who was to accompany us, remembered that he had neither fine coat nor umbrella,--indispensable for dignity, and highly necessary for the delicacy of his complexion, which was that of an elderly buffalo. A lad was started to fetch these articles; and he set off at a hand-gallop, making me certain that behind the first corner he would subside into a saunter, and lie down to rest on reaching the huts.|$|E
6000|$|... [p.82] and black. The Badawi of the Hijaz, {{and indeed}} the race generally, has a small eye, round, restless, deep-set, and fiery, {{denoting}} keen inspection with an ardent temperament and an impassioned character. Its colour is dark brown or <b>green-brown,</b> and the pupil is often speckled. The habit of pursing up the skin below the orbits, and half closing the lids to exclude glare, plants the outer angles with premature crows’-feet. Another peculiarity is the sudden {{way in which the}} eye opens, especially under excitement. This, combined with its fixity of glance, forms an expression now of lively fierceness, then of exceeding sternness; whilst the narrow space between the orbits impresses the countenance in repose with an intelligence not destitute of cunning. As a general rule, however, the expression of the Badawi face is rather dignity than that cunning for which the Semitic race is celebrated, and there are lines about the mouth in variance with the stern or the fierce look of the brow. The ears are like those of Arab horses, small, well-cut, “castey,” and elaborate, with many elevations and depressions. The nose is pronounced, generally aquiline, but sometimes straight like those Greek statues which have been treated as prodigious exaggerations of the facial angle. For the most part, it is a well-made feature with delicate nostrils, below which the septum appears: in anger they swell and open like a blood mare’s. I have, however, seen, in not a few instances, pert and offensive “pugs.” Deep furrows descend from the wings of the nose, showing an uncertain temper, now too grave, then too gay. The mouth is irregular. The lips are either bordes, denoting rudeness and want of taste, or they form a mere line. In the latter case there is an appearance of undue development in the upper portion of the countenance, especially when the jaws are ascetically thin, and the chin weakly retreats. The latter [p.83] feature, however, is generally well and strongly made. The teeth, as usual among Orientals, are white, even, short and broad—indications of strength. Some tribes trim their mustaches according to the “Sunnat”; the Shafe’i often shave them, and many allow them to hang Persian-like over the lips. The beard is represented by two tangled tufts upon the chin; where whisker should be, the place is either bare or is thinly covered with straggling pile.|$|E
