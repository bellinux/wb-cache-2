5|$|For {{the first}} few days, the newborn is {{unsteady}} on its feet, and needs the support of <b>its</b> <b>mother.</b> It relies on touch, smell, and hearing, as its eyesight is poor. It has little precise control over its trunk, which wiggles around and may cause it to trip. By its second week of life, the calf can walk more firmly and has more control over its trunk. After its first month, a calf can pick up, hold, and put objects in its mouth, but cannot suck water through the trunk and must drink directly through the mouth. It is still dependent on <b>its</b> <b>mother</b> and keeps close to her.|$|E
5|$|Along the way, {{she finds}} a Metroid egg that hatches in front of her. A Metroid {{hatchling}} floats out of the broken shell and imprints onto Samus, thinking that she is <b>its</b> <b>mother.</b> Unable to commit to her mission of extermination, Samus spares its life. She exits the tunnels while the Metroid helps clear the way. Reaching the planet's surface, Samus and the infant Metroid board the gunship together, setting the plot for Super Metroid.|$|E
5|$|For {{its first}} three months, a calf relies entirely on milk from <b>its</b> <b>mother</b> for nutrition, after which {{it begins to}} forage for {{vegetation}} and can use its trunk to collect water. At the same time, improvements in lip and leg coordination occur. Calves continue to suckle {{at the same rate}} as before until their sixth month, after which they become more independent when feeding. By nine months, mouth, trunk and foot coordination is perfected. After a year, a calf's abilities to groom, drink, and feed itself are fully developed. It still needs <b>its</b> <b>mother</b> for nutrition and protection from predators for at least another year. Suckling bouts tend to last 2–4 min/hr for a calf younger than a year and it continues to suckle until it reaches three years of age or older. Suckling after two years may serve to maintain growth rate, body condition and reproductive ability.|$|E

5|$|Ripley {{is taken}} to the Alien nest, where she finds Gediman, still alive and {{partially}} cocooned. The xenomorph queen, having developed a uterus {{as a result of}} her genetic contamination with Ripley 8, gives birth to a xenomorph with overtly human traits. The hybrid xenomorph recognizes Ripley 8 as <b>its</b> <b>mother,</b> killing the queen and Gediman. Ripley 8 takes advantage of the distraction to escape, and makes her way to the Betty.|$|E
5|$|With the {{introduction}} of Pokémon breeding, Pokémon are assigned {{to one or two}} breeding groups. When a male and female Pokémon that share at least one breeding group are left at a Pokémon Daycare, they may produce an egg, which will hatch into a young Pokémon. The young Pokémon will inherit the species of <b>its</b> <b>mother,</b> and moves from its father. However, legendary Pokémon, among certain other species, cannot breed.|$|E
5|$|Albrecht stated his {{original}} {{aim was to}} draw attention to the law, not to have Knut put down. In December 2006 he had taken legal action against Leipzig Zoo to prevent them from killing a sloth bear cub rejected by <b>its</b> <b>mother.</b> His case was dismissed on the grounds that humans raising the animal would have been against the law of nature. In response to the criticism against him, Albrecht said that he was merely drawing parallels between the two cubs. The publicity from this coverage raised Knut's profile from national to international.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Jonathan Gediman (Brad Dourif) {{is one of}} five {{scientists}} who clone Ripley, extract the Queen embryo and manage the cloned Aliens. After the embryo is extracted, Gediman begs Wren and Perez to allow Number 8 to live. When the Aliens escape, they abduct him while he investigates their disappearance. Gediman, seen cocooned in the lair when Number 8 is brought to the Queen, is overjoyed to see the Queen give birth to a hybrid Newborn through a human reproductive system. After killing <b>its</b> <b>mother,</b> the Newborn bites into Gediman's skull and kills him.|$|E
5|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} {{at the age}} of six to seven years, while males become sexually mature at about 10 years old. The {{gestation}} period is around 15–16 months. The calf, which typically weighs , is weaned after about 15 months and stays with <b>its</b> <b>mother</b> for the first two to three years of its life. In the wild, the birth interval for this species is estimated to be four to five years; its natural offspring-rearing behavior is unstudied.|$|E
5|$|Male orangutans play {{almost no}} role in raising the young. Females {{do most of the}} caring and socializing of the young. A female often has an older {{offspring}} with her to help in socializing the infant. Infant orangutans are completely dependent on their mothers for {{the first two years of}} their lives. The mother will carry the infant during travelling, as well as feed it and sleep with it in the same night nest. For the first four months, the infant is carried on its belly and never relieves physical contact. In the following months, the time an infant spends with <b>its</b> <b>mother</b> decreases.|$|E

5|$|On 7 April 1986, {{a healthy}} hybrid kitten between a male serval {{and a female}} {{domestic}} cat was born; this kitten was larger than a typical domestic kitten and resembled its father in its coat pattern. It appeared to have inherited a few domestic traits, such as tameness, from <b>its</b> <b>mother.</b> The hybrid cat may have a doglike habit of following its owner about, and {{can be a good}} swimmer. Over the years, savannah cats have gained popularity as pets.|$|E
5|$|Steinholt {{started her}} {{political}} {{career as a}} member of Red Youth, and later became a member of <b>its</b> <b>mother</b> party, Red. In 2007 Steinholt was elected as Red Nordland's leading candidate in the local elections of 2007. Steinholt had a very short election campaign, but she managed to make several notable appearances. Steinholt focused on environmental issues during the campaign, and opposed the establishment of a petroleum plant in northern Norway. Under her leadership, Red Norddland received 2,956 votes, 3.0 percent of the votes, an increase of 0.9% from the previous local election in 2003. Red won another seat on the Nordland County Council during the election; Steinholt became the youngest member of the council.|$|E
5|$|The black {{wildebeest}} is a herbivore, {{and almost}} the whole diet consists of grasses. Water {{is an essential}} requirement. There are three distinct social groups: the female herds, the bachelor herds and the territorial bulls. They are fast runners, and communicate {{using a variety of}} visual and vocal communication. The primary breeding season for the black wildebeest is from February to April. A single calf is usually born after a gestational period of about eight and a half months. The calf remains with <b>its</b> <b>mother</b> until her next calf is born a year later. The black wildebeest inhabits open plains, grasslands and Karoo shrublands.|$|E

5|$|The female tammar can {{conceive}} {{shortly after}} giving birth. Tammars undergo embryonic diapause and the blastocyst remains dormant {{for nearly a}} year. For {{the first half of}} the year, the presence of the joey in the pouch prevents the blastocyst from developing and experiments have shown that removing the joey within this first half will stimulate the blastocyst's development. However, after this the blastocyst remains dormant even after the joey has left. It begins to develop by the summer solstice in the end of December and the female gives birth around one month later. After birth the newborn young climbs unaided by <b>its</b> <b>mother</b> from the birth canal to the pouch.|$|E
5|$|The pygmy slow loris mates {{once every}} 12–18 months and has {{one or two}} {{offspring}} after an average gestation period of six months. For the first few days, the young loris clings to the belly of <b>its</b> <b>mother.</b> After six months the baby will be weaned, the females reach sexual maturity by 16 months, while the male reaches maturity by about 18 months. The pygmy slow loris is seasonally fertile during the months of July and August. Chemical signals {{play a role in}} the reproductive behavior of female pygmy slow lorises. Urine scent markings have a strong characteristic odor and are used to communication information about social relationships.|$|E
5|$|A {{dominant}} cub {{emerges in}} most litters, usually a male. This cub is more active than its siblings {{and takes the}} lead in their play, eventually leaving <b>its</b> <b>mother</b> and becoming independent earlier. The cubs open their eyes at six to fourteen days old. By eight weeks, the cubs make short ventures outside the den with their mother, although they do not travel with her as she roams her territory until they are older. The cubs are nursed for three to six months. Around {{the time they are}} weaned, they start to accompany their mother on territorial walks and they are taught how to hunt. The cubs often become capable (and nearly adult size) hunters at eleven months old. The cubs become independent around eighteen months of age, but it is not until they are around two to {{two and a half years}} old that they fully separate from their mother. Females reach sexual maturity at three to four years, whereas males do so at four to five years.|$|E

50|$|An early birth {{removes a}} {{developing}} marsupial from <b>its</b> <b>mother's</b> body much sooner than in placental mammals, thus marsupials have not developed a complex placenta {{to protect the}} embryo from <b>its</b> <b>mother's</b> immune system. Though early birth puts the tiny newborn marsupial at a greater environmental risk, it significantly reduces the dangers associated with long pregnancies, {{as there is no}} need to carry a large fetus to full term in bad seasons. Marsupials are extremely altricial animals, needing to be intensely cared for immediately following birth (cf. precocial).|$|R

5|$|A {{spin-off}} prequel show, First of the Summer Wine, premiered on BBC1 in 1988. The new programme {{was written}} by Roy Clarke and used different actors to follow {{the activities of the}} principal characters from Last of the Summer Wine {{in the months leading up}} to World War II. Unlike <b>its</b> <b>mother</b> show, First of the Summer Wine was not filmed in Holmfirth. Period music was used instead of Ronnie Hazlehurst's score to create a more World War II era atmosphere. New supporting characters were added to those from Last of the Summer Wine. Peter Sallis and Jonathan Linsley were the only actors from the original series to appear in the spin-off: Sallis played the father of his own character from the original show and Linsley appeared during the second series as a different character.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{presence}} of an embryo per se would be equivocal regarding this issue, the conditions in which the embryo were preserved provide strong evidence that Dinocephalosaurus was viviparous. There is no preserved calcified eggshell surrounding the embryo, despite {{the presence}} of delicately-preserved calcified elements from other animals at Luoping. This is consistent with the eggshells surrounding the embryos of viviparous reptiles being non-calcified membranes. Furthermore, the relative proportions of the humerus and the fibula in the embryo, compared with the maternal individual and IVPP V13898 from Panxian, indicate that the embryo is around 12% of the size of <b>its</b> <b>mother.</b> Combined with its ossified bones, this suggests that the embryo was at an advanced developmental stage, whereas crocodilians, birds, turtles, and tuataras lay eggs at very early developmental stages.|$|E
5|$|Hunting large whales {{usually takes}} several hours. Killer whales {{generally}} choose to attack young or weak animals; however, {{a group of}} five or more may attack a healthy adult. When hunting a young whale, a group chases it and <b>its</b> <b>mother</b> until they wear out. Eventually, they separate the pair and surround the calf, preventing it from surfacing to breathe, drowning it. Pods of female sperm whales sometimes protect themselves by forming a protective circle around their calves with their flukes facing outwards, using them to repel the attackers. Rarely, large killer whale pods can overwhelm even adult female sperm whales. Adult bull sperm whales, which are large, powerful and aggressive when threatened, and fully grown adult blue whales, which are possibly too large to overwhelm, are not believed to be prey for killer whales.|$|E
