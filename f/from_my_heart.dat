5|$|So much {{controversy}} has swirled around my career this past decade that very little attention ever gets paid to my music. The songs {{are all but}} forgotten. While I have no regrets regarding the choices I've made artistically, I've learned to appreciate {{the idea of doing}} things in a simpler way. So without a lot of fanfare, without any distractions, I present to you this collection of ballads. Some are old, some are new. All of them are <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart.</b>|$|E

500|$|That {{is one of}} {{my biggest}} records ever, hype-wise, the music itself, I love it to the core. I don’t do songs {{thinking}} this has to be a hit. I do music based on how I feel <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> and that is typically New Guy. New Guy is like a heart fulfilling type of record and to me, I think it actually hit the major impact that I wanted it to hit and people are loving it [...] My fans love it.|$|E

500|$|Her second album, <b>From</b> <b>My</b> <b>Heart,</b> {{was also}} her first under the {{production}} of Allen Reynolds, who {{is best known for}} his work with Crystal Gayle and Garth Brooks. Released in 1985, it produced the chart singles [...] "It's Your Reputation Talkin'", [...] "He Won't Give In", and [...] "Heart of the Country", which peaked at numbers 34, 22, and 46 respectively on Hot Country Songs. It also featured a cover of Elton John's [...] "Ball and Chain", from his 1982 album Jump Up! Ruhlmann found this album superior to its predecessor, stating that Reynolds [...] "seems to have shaped the song selections to the singer's talents and given her the opportunity to sing in a more individual manner." [...] A review of the album in Billboard was also positive, noting the [...] "more focused direction and a simpler, purer sound".|$|E
500|$|Meyerbeer's {{relationship}} with Heine displays the awkwardness and prickliness {{of the social}} personae of both parties. Meyerbeer, apart from any of his personal feelings, needed Heine onside as an influential personality and writer on music. He genuinely admired Heine's verse, and {{made a number of}} settings from it. Heine, living in Paris from 1830, always equivocal about his loyalties between Judaism and Christianity, and always short of money, asked Meyerbeer to intervene with Heine's own family for financial support and frequently took loans and money from Meyerbeer himself. He was not above threatening Meyerbeer with blackmail by writing satirical pieces about him (and indeed Meyerbeer paid Heine's widow to suppress such writings). And yet, at Heine's death in 1856, Meyerbeer wrote in his diary 'Peace be to his ashes. I forgive him <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> for his ingratitude and many wickednesses against me.' ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike {{her first}} studio album, Don't Forget, Lovato did not {{collaborate}} with the Jonas Brothers on Here We Go Again as {{she wanted to}} see what her sound would be like without their input. [...] "They were the only people I'd ever written with. Once I wrote with different people, I wanted to go with that", she told the New York Daily News. She said that her first album was [...] "very Jonas" [...] and that Here We Go Again is [...] "a little bit more like what's coming <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart.</b> It's more me." [...] However, Lovato did work with Nick Jonas on the song [...] "Stop the World". The majority of the album was produced by John Fields, who also handled production on Don't Forget. Other tracks were produced by SuperSpy, Gary Clark, Andy Dodd and Adam Watts. [...] "Catch Me" [...] is the only song on the album for which Lovato received sole writing credit. In an interview with The New York Times, she revealed that she wrote it in her room and that it means more to her {{than the rest of the}} album.|$|E

At first, {{seemingly}} confused, she questions him {{about where he}} has been, which he avoids answering. She then greets him joyfully (Ich preise dieses Wunder aus meines Herzens Tiefe!

500|$|... "Good Enough" [...] {{was written}} by Amy Lee for her long-time friend and husband, Josh Hartzler. It was {{produced}} by Dave Fortman and recorded in Record Plant Studios, Los Angeles. The single was scheduled for release in Germany in a basic and premium format on December 14, 2007, but a release date was never officially announced. While discussing Evanescences then upcoming album, The Open Door, Lee revealed {{that one of the}} tracks would be called [...] "Good Enough". She said, [...] "It's called 'Good Enough,' and it's completely, completely, completely different for me because it sort of [...] happy ending. It's the last song that I wrote for the record, and it's sort of the bravest, I think, for me because I had to tell the truth and the truth is, I feel, good now. The rest of the album is pretty aggressive and dark and everything else, but the last one is like, I got to the good place that I was heading for and I wrote about how good I felt. It turned out amazing, but it's like nothing we've ever done. I just have to write <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> and be genuine, because I think that's what people loved about our music to begin with, and if that changes, then that changes." ...|$|E

[...] The comment inspired {{the creation of the}} Vermin Club by angry Conservatives; they attacked Bevan for years for the metaphor. [...] Labour Party deputy leader Herbert Morrison complained that Bevan's attack had backfired, for his words [...] "did much more to make the Tories work and vote... than Conservative Central Office could have done." ...|$|E

Goodrem described the material as [...] "...a lot lighter" [...] compared to her previous album Mistaken Identity. She has also stated, [...] "As people {{become more aware of}} your life, they can pinpoint what songs are about. On this album, I've tried to remove a lot of that and just write great pop songs, songs that are <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> but there's no baggage with them". The album debuted at number one on the ARIA Albums Chart, making it her third number one album in her home country. and received platinum certification for shipments of 70,000 records, though sales were much lower; only 23,000 copies were sold during the first week. In December the album was certified 2x platinum. It eventually was certified 3x platinum in 2008. In New Zealand, the album debuted at number twelve on the RIANZ Albums Chart.|$|E

My reason tells me that honest & conscientious doubts cannot be a sin, but I feel it would be a painful void between us. I thank you <b>from</b> <b>my</b> <b>heart</b> for your openness with me & I should dread the feeling that you were concealing your opinions from the fear of giving me pain. It is perhaps foolish of me to say this much but my own dear Charley we now do belong to each other & I cannot help being open with you. Will you do me a favour? yes I am sure you will, it is to read our Saviours farewell discourse to his disciples which begins {{at the end of the}} 13th Chap of John.

It is so full of love to them & devotion & every beautiful feeling." [...] In the Farewell Discourse from the Gospel of St. John, Jesus instructs his disciples to [...] "love one another", a central part of Christian doctrine which emphasises the need for belief. For Emma the importance of faith had been reinforced by the death of her sister Fanny in 1832, and her need to meet Fanny again in the afterlife. She clearly felt that Darwin would be able to overcome doubt and believe. John 15 also says [...] "If a man abide not in me...they are burned". Darwin's warm reply reassured her, and she replied that [...] "To see you in earnest on the subject will be my greatest comfort & that I am sure you are. I believe I agree with every word you say, & it pleased me that you shd have felt inclined to enter a little more on the subject." [...] However, this tension would remain.|$|E
