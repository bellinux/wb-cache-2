40|$|Hydrogen is {{expected}} to become an important energy carrier for sustainable energy production, transformation and consumption with reduced impacts on the local and global environment. Development of hydrogen based energy and transport systems needs reliable and inexpensive methods of relatively pure hydrogen production, storage and supply. Iron as a common metal was suggested for hydrogen production by reaction with steam at higher temperatures [1]. The basic principle of the cyclic <b>iron</b> <b>sponge</b> process is to reduce iron oxides with the reducing gases (H 2, CO, CH 4 etc.) utilizing metallurgic knowledge of iron oxides reduction and to oxidize the iron by steam for hydrogen supply. In this process a syngas (e. g. from biomass gasification [2]) or a gas mixture from steam reforming of hydrocarbon fuels can be converted into relatively pure hydrogen [3]. The main disadvantage of iron in the redox cyclic process of hydrogen production is, however, the possibility of soot, Fe 3 C and FeCO 3 formation in the reduction process by CO and CO 2 containing gases. Such carbon precursors lead {{to the production of}} hydrogen with carbon containing impurities in the steam oxidation step. Relatively cheap and common alloying elements Cr, Ni and Mn have been chosen for the basic thermodynamic study with respect to compatibility with iron and lower tendency for carbide and carbonate formation.

Through metallographic inter-pretation and study of the analyzed results, the steel manufacturing and iron smelting using heat processing in the iron artifacts excavated from the central southern region of the ancient Korean peninsula was studied, and {{the analysis of the}} non-metallic inclusions mixed within the metal-lic structures was interpreted as the ternary phase diagram of the oxide to infer the type of iron ores for the iron products and the temperature of the furnace used to smelt them. Most of the ancient forged iron arti-facts showed Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 with high SiO 2 contents and relatively low Al 2 O 3 contents for iron ore, indicating t hat for Al 2 O 3 below 5 %, it is presumed that magnetic iron ores were reduced to bloom <b>iron</b> (<b>sponge</b> iron) with direct-reduction process for production.

40|$|Electric {{generation}} and transmission systems {{may not always}} meet peak demands. However, when the total demand {{is more than the}} generation, overall demand must be lowered, either by turning off service to some devices or cutting back the supply voltage in order to prevent uncontrolled service disruptions such as power outages or equipment damage. Utilities may impose load shedding on service areas via rolling blackouts or by agreements with specific high use industrial consumers to turn off equipment at times of system-wide peak demand. However it is quite different when this is applied on microgrids. Since microgrid is normally isolated from the main transmission line, therefore they have their own generation which is the distributed generation (DGs). DGs resources can include fuels cells, wind, solar or other energy sources. Distributed generation allows collection of energy from many sources and may give lower environmental impacts and improved security of supply. The multiple dispersed generation sources and ability to isolate the microgrid from a larger network would provide highly reliable electric power. Therefore, differential evolution (DE) is applied in a microgrid system in order to optimize the load shedding by reducing the total curtailed load. Direct Reduction (DR) Plant in Perwaja Steel Sdn Bhd. has its own microgrid system which is used to produce direct reduction iron (<b>iron</b> <b>sponge).</b> Load shedding is one of the security measures which are applied in the plant in to maintain the stability of the system. After the load shedding process, more cost is needed to restore the curtailed load. However, cost will be reduced if the total curtailed loads which are needed to be restored are reduced. Therefore DE is applied to reduce the total curtailed load in the DR Plant microgrid system...|$|E

40|$|India is {{emerging}} as the leading producer of <b>sponge</b> <b>iron</b> among developing as well industrially developed nations. <b>Sponge</b> <b>iron</b> is produced by direct reduction of iron ore (DRI process) and is popular because of use of non-coking coal.
