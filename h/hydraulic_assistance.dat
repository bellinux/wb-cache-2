5000|$|... 1955 Citroën DS: Suspension, power steering, {{brakes and}} gearbox/clutch {{assembly}} powered by high pressure <b>hydraulic</b> <b>assistance.</b> A belt driven 7-piston pump, similar {{in size to}} a power steering pump, generates this pressure when the engine is running.|$|E
50|$|To {{reduce the}} {{pressure}} on the turning mechanism, a hydraulic press was installed in the pivot. When water was admitted to the press it took up to half the weight. So successful was this system of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>assistance</b> that Leader Williams retrofitted it to several road swing bridges being built over the Ship Canal including the ones at Stockton Heath and Knutsford Road in Warrington.|$|E
50|$|In {{common with}} other power {{steering}} systems, {{the control valve}} is of the rotary type and consists of a valve rotor and torsion bar. The valve rotor is the input shaft to the steering gear and has six longitudinal grooves machined into its outer surface. When no load {{is applied to the}} steering wheel, these grooves lie between six grooves in the valve sleeve and no <b>hydraulic</b> <b>assistance</b> is applied.|$|E
5000|$|Rack and pinion, a small {{quantity}} of cars also had <b>hydraulic</b> power <b>assistance.</b> Steering wheel diameter 14 in, 1.8 turns lock-to-lock, ...|$|R
5000|$|Standard were 284 mm {{ventilated}} front discs with 276 mm at the rear. The 3.2 V6 has 330 mm ventilated discs at front. [...] The GT included {{anti-lock braking}} system with electronic brakeforce distribution and <b>hydraulic</b> brake <b>assistance.</b>|$|R
50|$|All facelifted BMW 6 Series xDrive models get <b>Hydraulic</b> Steering <b>Assistance,</b> and {{all models}} are {{available}} in xDrive variants which improves the 0-60 times. All (640i/d and 650i) models come with BMW's TwinPower Turbo technology, and all models meet the EU6 Exhaust Emissions standard. The 650i Coupe and Gran Coupé feature 445hp, and can go from 0-60 in only 4.3s.|$|R
50|$|The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>assistance</b> is {{supplied}} by a servo piston {{operating in a}} cylinder integral with the steering box casting. The teeth of a rack projecting from the piston mesh with a sector of a spur gear machined into the sector shaft. A roller in the sector shaft meshes with the helical track on the cam, and the two together are responsible for providing the variable ratio. No external lockstops are provided as they are incorporated into the steering box.|$|E
50|$|The DC-10 {{included}} no cable backup for {{the hydraulic}} powered flight controls {{because it was}} considered nearly impossible for three hydraulic systems to fail during one flight, and the control surfaces are too large to be moved without <b>hydraulic</b> <b>assistance.</b> All three hydraulic systems were in close proximity, directly beneath the tail engine. The #2 engine explosion hurled fragments that ruptured all three lines, resulting in total loss of control to the elevators, ailerons, spoilers, horizontal stabilizer, rudder, flaps and slats.|$|E
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} power steering (HPS) uses hydraulic pressure supplied by an engine-driven pump to assist the motion of turning the steering wheel. Electric power steering (EPS) is more efficient than {{hydraulic power}} steering, since the electric power steering motor only needs to provide assistance when the steering wheel is turned, whereas the hydraulic pump must run constantly. In EPS, the amount of assistance is easily tunable to the vehicle type, road speed, and even driver preference. An added benefit is the elimination of environmental hazard posed by leakage and disposal of {{hydraulic power steering}} fluid. In addition, electrical assistance is not lost when the engine fails or stalls, whereas <b>hydraulic</b> <b>assistance</b> stops working if the engine stops, making the steering doubly heavy as the driver must now turn not only the very heavy steering—without any help—but also the power-assistance system itself.|$|E
50|$|The new 500 {{has seven}} airbags in all models and {{available}} ABS brakes, ESP (electronic stability program), ASR (antislip regulation), HBA (<b>hydraulic</b> brake <b>assistance)</b> and hill holder. The 500 was awarded five stars by EuroNCAP, succeeding the BMW MINI as the shortest car {{to have a}} five-star rating. Fiat {{also said that the}} 500 was engineered so that it would have achieved a six-star rating had EuroNCAP adopted this classification.|$|R
50|$|The {{weight of}} the {{structure}} meant that the design was pushing {{the limits of the}} possible. This became clear when the sixty-four 35.5cm (14 inches) mean diameter hollow cast-iron rollers started to deform. By 1927 the structure had dropped by 8.89cm (3 1/2-inches). In 1928 the iron rollers were replaced with steel and since then the bridge has dropped by only 2.4mm (3/32-inch). Once the iron rollers were replaced the <b>hydraulic</b> press <b>assistance</b> was dispensed with.|$|R
50|$|Based, as they were, on the Fiat Group's Tipo Due (Type Two) platform, the 145 and 146 had a unibody structure, front MacPherson strut {{and rear}} {{trailing}} arm suspensions. A peculiarity of these cars {{is that they}} were designed to be fitted with both longitudinal engines (the older Boxers) and with transverse engines (the diesels and the Twin Spark). The former were mounted in the same configuration as on the 33 or Alfasud, that is longitudinally overhanging the front axle with the gearbox towards the cabin; the latter in the conventional transverse position with the gearbox to the left side. All engines were coupled to 5-speed manual transmissions.Steering was rack and pinion, with standard <b>hydraulic</b> power <b>assistance.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} of flight testing was performed at Zamperini Field in Torrance, California. Flight {{testing and certification}} was performed in the late 1970s by test pilot Joseph John [...] "Tym" [...] Tymczyszyn and the R22 received FAA certification in March 1979.Due to relatively low acquisition and operating costs, the R22 has been popular as a primary rotorcraft trainer {{around the world and}} as a livestock management tool on large ranches in North America and cattle stations in Australia. The R22 has a very low inertia rotor system and the control inputs are operated directly by push rods with no <b>hydraulic</b> <b>assistance.</b> Thus, the flight controls are very sensitive and require a light touch to avoid over correcting. A student that masters an R22 generally does not have a problem transitioning to a heavier helicopter. Due to the issues relating to a low inertia rotor system and a teetering main rotor, operation by any pilot in the United States of the Robinson R22 or Robinson R44 requires a special endorsement by a certified flight instructor. Tip weights were added to increase rotor inertia, but the small rotor limits weight.|$|E
40|$|International audienceRecent {{advances}} towards steer-by-wire {{technology have}} promised {{significant improvements in}} vehicle handling performance and safety. This technology inspired from aeronautics, consists in replacing the traditional mechanical linkages and/or hydraulic power assist with electrical equivalents. This paper describes the adopted approach for {{development of a new}} dynamic model of a Steer-by-wire system with <b>hydraulic</b> <b>assistance</b> in the case of stopped vehicle. The aim is to establish dynamic equations of the forces and torques exchanged between handwheel and the front wheels during steering operations. Some simulation results are provided. The proposed model will be experimented using a prototype equipped with handwheel feedback system...|$|E
40|$|The {{prediction}} of steering wheel torque {{in a truck}} is a challenging subject due to the many components connecting the driver to the front wheels. In order to accurately predict the steering wheel torque a highly detailed model is required. Steering systems in commercial vehicle handling simulation models found in literature are often modeled in a simple way while literature on passenger vehicles suggests {{the necessity of a}} higher model complexity. In this research a highly detailed model with four states, friction, stiffness, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>assistance</b> and the necessary kinematic relations is developed. This model could assist {{in the development of the}} steering system in the early stages of the design. The model is able to accurately predict the steering wheel torque, drag link force and king pin angles. The parameters for this model are estimated by means of dedicated tests and the steering system model is validated outside of the vehicle...|$|E
50|$|This vehicle has an 8-cylinder, 4-stroke, {{water cooled}} MERCEDES OM 402 diesel engine with direct injection, {{installed}} longitudinally under the cab. The vehicle’s transmission includes: friction clutch, 6-gear synchronous mechanical gearbox, two-stage differential transfer case that provides permanent all wheels drive, rigid drive axles with leaf springs, additional rubber springs and hydraulic telescopic shock absorbers. The pneumatic braking system has drum brakes on all wheels. The steering is <b>hydraulic</b> with servo <b>assistance.</b> The frame has two longitudinal and several transversal brackets, while the cab is a trambus type. Both inter-axial {{and all three}} axial differentials can be locked mechanically. The vehicle has a system of central pressure control in tires.|$|R
40|$|Small {{manufacturing}} enterprises {{comprise the}} bulk of manufacturing industry yet little account is taken of such firms {{in the literature on}} design theory and methodology. This paper presents an account of the in-house design style of a small, innovative company that designed and manufactures an award winning range of <b>hydraulic</b> cylinders. With <b>assistance</b> from the University of Queensland this company is adopting more formal design methods as part of a major new product development project over three years. The company 2 ̆ 7 s experience of learning about and adopting quality function deployment (QFD) concepts and procedures is presented as an example of this process. The transition to new methods has been accompanied by changes in personnel and responsibilities. Based on this shared experience, the process of transforming design practice in the company is not characterised by a linear model of technology transfer. Rather it is best described by an action research model of cyclic learning and mutual discovery focused on practice, research and teaching leading to a set of concurrent outcomes for each participant...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a multi-body 44 -DOF tractor {{semi-trailer}} model is coupled to a 4 -DOF steeringsystem 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆ewhich includes friction and hydraulic power-steering. An extended wheel hub geometry {{is used to}} provide the correct feedback torque from the wheels. A tie-rod with stiffness has been included to connect left and right. An instrumented tractor semi-trailer is used to verify the steering-system model predictions during driving. The focus lies on the prediction of the steering-wheel torque and the vehicle velocity and steering-wheel angle are prescribed as an input for the simulation. Two tests are discussed in this paper, a J-turn at 80 km/h and sinusoidal steering-wheel input with a frequency of 0. 4 Hz at 65 km/h. The comparison of the measured signals and the predicted values shows that the steering-system model is accurate. The non-linearities caused by friction and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>assistance</b> system can clearly be seen in both the measurement and the simulation...|$|E
