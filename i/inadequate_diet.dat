Restrictions were imposed on the inclusion of items and the energy contribution of the various food groups. A reduction in average cost of diet was applied at intervals of R$ 0. 15 to the lowest possible cost. We identified an inverse association between energy density and cost of diet (p < 0. 05), and at the lowest possible cost we obtained the maximum value of energy density Restrictions on the diet's cost resulted in the selection of diets with higher energy density, indicating that cost of diet may lead to the adoption of <b>inadequate</b> <b>diets</b> in Brazil...|$|R
40|$|Many {{people living}} in {{developing}} countries depend on diets based on cereal staples. Such diets lack diversity, which may result in micronutrient deficiencies. A complementary food made from cereals is often low in mineral content and contains significant quantities of mineral absorption inhibitors like phytic acid and condensed tannins.

Conversely, dietary protein deficiency has been found to reduce the incidence of spontaneous tumors (12, 13) and increase resistance to transplantable tumors (14). Recent work has suggested that this phenomenon may be due to a preferential suppression of antibody production in animals fed diets containing moderate amounts of protein (15). This failure to produce tumor-specific "blocking " antibody is reflected in what appear to be heightened cell-mediated immune responses against tumor antigens (16).
