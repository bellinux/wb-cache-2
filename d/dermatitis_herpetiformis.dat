25|$|As {{buckwheat}} {{contains no}} gluten, {{it may be}} eaten by people with gluten-related disorders, such as celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity or <b>dermatitis</b> <b>herpetiformis.</b> Nevertheless, buckwheat may have gluten contamination.|$|E
25|$|Some of the viral infections {{mentioned}} above are also classified as vesiculobullous diseases.

25|$|While coeliac {{disease is}} caused by a {{reaction}} to wheat proteins, it {{is not the same as}} a wheat allergy. Other diseases triggered by eating gluten are non-coeliac gluten sensitivity, (estimated to affect 0.5% to 13% of the general population), gluten ataxia and <b>dermatitis</b> <b>herpetiformis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{autoimmune}} disorders {{have been recorded}} with the neurovisceral and cutaneous genetic porphyrias including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, <b>dermatitis</b> <b>herpetiformis,</b> diabetes, systemic and discoid lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, scleroderma, Sjogren's disease and scleritis. Physicians should be on high alert for porphyrias in families with {{autoimmune disorders}} and {{care must be taken}} with the use of potential porphyrinogenic drugs, including sulfasalazine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dermatitis</b> <b>herpetiformis</b> {{symptoms}} include itching, stinging and a burning sensation. Papules and vesicles are commonly present. The small red bumps experienced {{in this type}} of dermatitis are usually about 1cm in size, red in color and may be found symmetrically grouped or distributed on the upper or lower back, buttocks, elbows, knees, neck, shoulders, and scalp. Less frequently, the rash may appear inside the mouth or near the hairline.|$|E
25|$|Initially, Corday {{planned to}} assassinate Marat {{in front of}} the entire National Convention, {{intending}} to make an example out of him, but upon arriving in Paris she discovered that Marat no longer attended meetings because his health was deteriorating due to a skin disorder (perhaps <b>dermatitis</b> <b>herpetiformis).</b> She was then forced to change her plan. She went to Marat's home before noon on 13 July, claiming to have knowledge of a planned Girondist uprising in Caen; she was turned away by Catherine Evrard, the sister of his fiancee Simonne.|$|E
25|$|There {{is reason}} for caution with {{prescribing}} the ingestion of {{high doses of}} potassium iodide and iodate, as their unnecessary use can cause conditions such as the Jod-Basedow phenomena, and the Wolff-Chaikoff effect, trigger and/or worsen hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, and then cause temporary or even permanent thyroid conditions. It can also cause sialadenitis (an inflammation of the salivary gland), gastrointestinal disturbances, allergic reactions and rashes. Potassium iodide is also not recommended {{for those who have}} had an allergic reaction to iodine, and people with <b>dermatitis</b> <b>herpetiformis</b> and hypocomplementemic vasculitis– conditions that are linked to a risk of iodine sensitivity.|$|E

2500|$|In addition, innate {{immunity}} to IRP peptide {{is involved in}} coeliac disease, <b>dermatitis</b> <b>herpetiformis</b> and possibly juvenile diabetes. IRP targets monocytes and increases the production of IL-15 by an HLA-DQ independent pathway, a subsequent study showed that both this region and the [...] "33mer" [...] could create the same response, in cells from both treated coeliacs and non-coeliacs. However, unlike the non-coeliacs, the treated coeliac cells produce the disease marker nitrite. This indicates that another abnormality in people with coeliac disease that allows stimulation to proceed past the normal healthy state. After extensive study, there is no known genetic association for this that appears to stand out at present, and implicates other environmental factors in the defect.|$|E

50|$|Throughout the 1960s, other {{features}} of coeliac disease were elucidated. Its hereditary character was recognised in 1965. In 1966, <b>dermatitis</b> <b>herpetiformis</b> {{was linked to}} gluten sensitivity.|$|E

5000|$|A {{study of}} {{patients}} with <b>dermatitis</b> <b>herpetiformis</b> or coeliac disease revealed significantly moregluten in the blood than controls. [...] This {{increases the risk of}} asthma, anaphylaxis and dermatological conditions.|$|E
50|$|Various {{research}} studies {{have pointed out}} different potential factors that may play a larger or smaller {{role in the development}} of <b>dermatitis</b> <b>herpetiformis.</b> The fact that eTG has been found in precipitates of skin-bound IgA from skin affected by this condition has been used to conclude that <b>dermatitis</b> <b>herpetiformis</b> may be caused by a deposition of both IgA and eTG within the dermis. It is estimated that these deposits may resorb after 10 years of following a gluten-free diet. Moreover, it is suggested that this condition is closely linked to genetics. This theory is based on the arguments that individuals with a family history of gluten sensitivity who still consume foods containing gluten are more likely to develop the condition as a result of the formation of antibodies to gluten. These antibodies cross-react with eTG, and IgA/eTG complexes deposit within the papillary dermis to cause the lesions of <b>dermatitis</b> <b>herpetiformis.</b> These IgA deposits can disappear after long-term (up to 10 years) avoidance of dietary gluten.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dermatitis</b> <b>herpetiformis</b> {{generally}} responds well to {{medication and}} changes in diet. However, it is an autoimmune disease, and patients with DH {{are more likely than}} others to have thyroid problems and intestinal lymphoma.|$|E
50|$|When {{looked at}} under the microscope, the skin {{affected}} by <b>dermatitis</b> <b>herpetiformis</b> presents {{a collection of}} neutrophils. They have an increased prevalence in the areas where the dermis is closest to the epidermis.|$|E

50|$|Immunological studies {{revealed}} {{findings that}} {{are similar to those of}} coeliac disease in terms of autoantigens. The main autoantigen of <b>dermatitis</b> <b>herpetiformis</b> is epidermal transglutaminase (eTG), a cytosolic enzyme involved in cell envelope formation during keratinocyte differentiation.|$|E
50|$|The {{risks of}} {{developing}} complications from <b>dermatitis</b> <b>herpetiformis</b> decrease significantly if the affected individuals follow a gluten-free diet.
