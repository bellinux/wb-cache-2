40|$|A new simple, {{sensitive}} and selective kinetic spectrophotometric method {{was developed for}} the determination of <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> in pharmaceutical products. The method {{is based on the}} enhancing effect of <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> on the sodium periodate-potas-sium bromide-meta cresol purple reaction system in the presence of thiocyanate. The reaction starts after an induction period, which decreased by addition of <b>iron</b> (<b>II).</b> The reciprocal of the reaction induction period is proportional to the <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> concentration. The decolorization of meta cresol purple (MCP) at 525 nm was used to monitor the reaction spectrophotometrically. Under optimum conditions, <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> can be determined in the range of 0. 020 – 4. 0 μg mL– 1 with a 3 σ detection limit of 0. 017 μg mL– 1. The relative standard deviations for five replicate determinations of 0. 030, 0. 20, and 2. 0 μg mL– 1 <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> were 2. 9 %, 2. 7 % and 2. 3 %, respectively. This method was successfully used in the determina-tion of <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> in ferrous sulfate pharmaceutical products...|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} {{scientific}} approaches for {{the determination of}} cellular growth influences of known or novel substances under in vitro conditions, among which colourimetric absorption measurement {{is considered to be}} one of the convenient methods. [3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 5 -(3 -carboxymethoxyphenyl) - 2 - (4 -sulfophenyl) - 2 H-tetrazolium] (MTS) assay is one of the commonly used colourimetric absorption assays based on the ability of dehydrogenase from viable cells to produce the brown soluble formazan detectable at 490 nm. Here we have tested the possible growth influence of <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> sulphate on two human cancer cell lines, the K 562 chronic myelogenous leukaemia and T 47 D breast carcinoma cells, based on the MTS assay. We found that <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> sulphate possessed an inhibitory effect when added at 16 - to 125 -μM concentrations, but <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> sulphate became growth stimulatory when its concentration was further increased to 1000 μM. In addition, a dose-dependent increase in absorbance at the same wavelength was observed when we repeated the experiments without the addition of MTS and phenazine methosulfate. When we further repeated the cell growth determinations using adenosine triphosphate content assay for K 562 and 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay for T 47 D, <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> sulphate showed a consistent dose-dependent growth inhibitory effect. Morphological investigation after methylene blue staining clearly demonstrated that <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> sulphate, at a concentration of 1000 μM, is cytotoxic to T 47 D cells. Interestingly, a consistent increment for the absorbance at 490 nm was further observed with increased <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> sulphate concentration either in the presence or absence of MTS even in a cell-free environment. Thus we conclude that <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> sulphate is actually growth inhibitory and even cytotoxic at high concentrations towards the K 562 and T 47 D cancer cells and the paradoxical proliferative activity of <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> sulphate on these two cancer cell lines using the MTS assay was solely due to the oxidation of initial pale green <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> to brownish <b>iron</b> (III) during incubation in the aqueous condition.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{characterize}} the natural clinoptilolite from Tasajeras deposit, Cuba, modified by hydrothermal ion-exchange with solutions of <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> sulfate and <b>iron</b> (III) nitrate in acid medium. Besides this, its catalytic activity to reduce nitrogen monoxide with carbon monoxide/propene {{in the presence of}} oxygen was evaluated. The characterization was performed by Mössbauer and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopies and adsorption measurements. The obtained results lead to conclude that in exchanged samples, incorporated divalent and trivalent irons are found in octahedral coordination. Both irons should be mainly in cationic extra-framework positions inside clinoptilolite channels as charge compensating cations, and also as iron oxy-hydroxides resulting from limited hydrolysis of these cations. The iron (III) exchanged samples has a larger amount of iron oxy-hydroxides agglomerates. The <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> exchanged samples have additionally <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> sulfate adsorbed.

This redox active system will be incorporated into oligonucleotides to study the electron transfer through the molecular π-stack system of DNA in future studies. This synthesis used a chiral metalation to synthesize α-aminoferrocenenitrile. t-Butylcarbamate as the metalation-directing group gave a low yield of the 1, 2 -disubstituted ferrocene. N,N-diisopropylcarboxamide as the metalation-directing group using a chiral base gave moderate yields of 1, 2 -disubstituted ferrocene derivatives. However, standard hydrolytic methods failed to hydrolyze the diisopropylamide grouping in these 1, 2 -disubstituted ferrocene derivatives. A new method was developed to convert the amide functionality of N,N-diisopropylferrocenecarboxamide to ester functionality using Me₃O⁺BF₄⁻, NaOMe and an acidic workup. Unfortunately, when this condition was applied to iodo-N,N-diisopropylferrocenecarboxamide and amino-N,N-diisopropylferrocenecarboxamide, only starting materials and N',N'-dimethylamino-N,N-diisopropylferrocenecarboxamide were obtained, respectively.

Evidence that a novel ternary complex comprised of one β-CD, one <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> and one toluene exists as an inclusion complex has been compiled via ES-MS and ES-MS/MS experiments {{as well as by}} a computational approach. This evidence strongly suggests that <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> serves to modify the conformation of the β-CD ring, and that toluene inclusion is stabilized by dication interaction with the toluene π-system and by crimping of the β-CD ring leading to stronger van der Waals interactions with toluene.

The {{mechanism by which}} oxidation of <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> occurs in BFR is largely unknown, but previous studies indicated that there is ferroxidase activity associated with a site capable of forming a dinuclear-iron centre within each subunit [Le Brun, Wilson, Andrews, Harrison, Guest, Thomson and Moore (1993) FEBS Lett. 333, 197 - 202]. We now report site-directed mutagenesis experiments based on a putative dinuclear-metal-ion-binding site located within the BFR subunit. The data reveal that this dinuclear-iron centre is located at a site within the four-alpha-helical bundle of each subunit of BFR, thus identified as the ferroxidase centre of BFR.

This study compared the retinal LPO products, after the incubation with nitric oxide or hydroxyl radical, with those of two commonly studied tissues-kidney and liver. Methods: Retina, liver and kidney were obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats. These samples were homogenised and incubated with variously 2, 20 or 200 μM <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> or sodium nitroprusside (SNP) solution for 60 minutes at 37 °C.

Results: After the <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> and SNP treatments, MDA levels were significantly different among the three tissues (p < 0. 0001) in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0. 0001). The retinal MDA level {{was significantly higher than}} those of the kidney (p < 0. 001) and the liver (p < 0. 001). For the <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> -treated homogenates, the differences in MDA were statistically significant in the retina (p = 0. 0001) and the liver (p = 0. 0004). For the SNP-treated homogenates, the differences in MDA were all statistically significant in the retina (p = 0. 002), the liver (p < 0. 0001) and the kidney (p < 0. 0001). There was no statistical difference in retinal MDA concentrations between <b>iron</b> (<b>II)</b> and SNP treatments (p = 0. 41).
