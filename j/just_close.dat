Even the two seconds light speed delay for the Moon is too far away for telepresence exploration from Earth. The L1 and L2 positions permit 400-millisecond round trip delays, which is <b>just</b> <b>close</b> enough for telepresence operation. Telepresence has also been suggested {{as a way to}} repair satellites in Earth orbit from Earth. The Exploration Telerobotics Symposium in 2012 explored this and other topics.|$|E

500|$|Psychologically, the Klondike, as {{historian}} Pierre Berton describes, was [...] "just {{far enough away}} to be romantic and <b>just</b> <b>close</b> enough to be accessible." [...] Furthermore, the Pacific ports closest to the gold strikes were desperate to encourage trade and travel to the region. The mass journalism of the period promoted the event and the human interest stories that lay behind it. A worldwide publicity campaign engineered largely by Erastus Brainerd, a Seattle newspaper man, helped establish the city as the premier supply centre and the departure point for the gold fields.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s Grant became {{troubled by the}} deaths {{of so many of}} his close friends, {{including}} Howard Hughes in 1976, Howard Hawks in 1977, Lord Mountbatten and Barbara Hutton in 1979, Alfred Hitchcock in 1980, Grace Kelly and Ingrid Bergman in 1982, and David Niven in 1983. At the funeral of Mountbatten he was quoted as remarking to a friend: [...] "I'm absolutely pooped, and I'm so goddamned old...I'm going to quit all next year. I'm going to lie in bed...I shall <b>just</b> <b>close</b> all doors, turn off the telephone, and enjoy my life". Kelly's death was the hardest hitting on Grant, as the death was unexpected, and the two remained close friends after filming To Catch a Thief. Grant visited Monaco three or four times each year during his retirement, and showed his support for Kelly by joining the board of the Princess Grace Foundation.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Chad Hillard of Hillydilly wrote that [...] "the host of visuals—while definitely intriguing—prove {{to be quite}} ironic considering her claim that she's away from those drug things". Writing for Idolator, Bradley Stern described the clip as [...] "a strangely trippy, kaleidoscopic affair with lots of weird camera tricks" [...] and {{said that it was}} a [...] "simple, yet effective treatment". However, Mark Savage of Discopop gave the video a negative review, writing, [...] " [...] It's a crying shame that the video for [...] Not on Drugs, is so undercooked. The weird editing, the weirder haircuts, the cheap effects and cheaper locations are a woeful disservice to the song's gutsy declaration of love". He also called it a [...] "disappointment" [...] and stated that [...] "maybe <b>just</b> <b>close</b> your eyes and enjoy the song". As of July 2017, it has received over 35 million views on YouTube.|$|E
500|$|... "Acrobat" [...] {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{personal}} songs on Achtung Baby with Bono acknowledging personal weakness, contradictions, and inadequacy. The Edge noted that the song contained [...] "a bit of venom", likening it to [...] "the bitter, John Lennon tradition of 'Working Class Hero', slightly snarling and cynical." [...] Bono stated [...] "as we moved from the eighties to the nineties, I stopped throwing rocks at the obvious symbols of power and the abuse of it. I started throwing rocks at my own hypocrisy... 'Acrobat' [...] 'Don't believe what you hear, don't believe what you see / If you <b>just</b> <b>close</b> your eyes / You can feel the enemy...' I can't remember it, but the point is: you start to see the world in a different way, and you're part of the problem, not just part of the solution". In 2006, he noted it was [...] "a song about being a hypocrite, and I think we all can be and I certainly have been. And you know, you exact very high standards on people in the world but then you don't live them personally", noting the theme was most evident in the lyric [...] "I must be an acrobat to talk like this and act like that". Hot Press editor Niall Stokes felt The Edge's guitar playing combined elements of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] with [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky". Speaking of its theme he said [...] "at its heart is an awareness of the ravages of time, and what it does to people and to relationships. But beyond that, there is the self-awareness that, itself, comes only with experience... Bono acknowledges his own weakness and inadequacy. He is more conscious now than ever before of the contradictions in his own position." [...] Andy Greene of Rolling Stone believed the [...] "aggressive and venomous" [...] song reflected Bono's thoughts during the album sessions, saying [...] "Nearly every lyric brims with rage... It was a new decade and it was quite possible they were about to be dismissed as a relic of the past." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Shi'a sources, even in {{historical}} works of Al-Shaykh al-Saduq, {{the birth of}} the twelfth Imam was miraculous which must be considered as hagiography. Aside from Shi'i works almost nothing is known about the life of the twelfth Imam. Some even cast doubt on his existence. This is because Abbasids were crushing every revolt of Alids which caused al-Askari to hide the child' birth on 255/868 and <b>just</b> <b>close</b> companions get informed of the birth. However, this belief has long been criticized. Critics say the occultation of the 12th Imam [...] "became subsequent orthodox doctrine" [...] after none of the competing theories that sought to explain the succession to a childless 11th Imam [...] "seemed satisfactory". According to Bernard Lewis with each new leader [...] "who disappeared and did not return", this belief was [...] "enriched" [...] and became more detailed and [...] "essential" [...] as a [...] "feature of Shia Islam." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{increasing}} ocean exploration {{over the}} last two decades has come the realisation that humans have had an extensive impact on the world’s oceans, not <b>just</b> <b>close</b> to our shores, but also reaching down into the deep sea. [...] From destructive fishing practices and exploitation of mineral resources to pollution and litter, evidence of human impact can be found in virtually all deep-sea ecosystems. [...] In response, the international community has set a series of ambitious goals aimed at protecting the marine environment and its resources for future generations. [...] Three of these initiatives, decided on by world leaders during the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (Johannesburg), are to achieve a significant reduction in biodiversity loss by 2010, to introduce an ecosystems approach to marine resource assessment and management by 2010, and to designate a network of marine protected areas by 2012. [...] A crucial requirement for implementing these is the availability of high-quality scientific data and knowledge, as well as effective science-policy interfaces to ensure the policy relevance of research and to enable the rapid translation of scientific information into science policy.|$|E

Just as he was within ten yards of him, the Indian drew his knife, and hurled it at the breast of his enemy with such violence that it hissed in its passage through the air. Dick received it on his shield, where it stood quivering. Plucking it therefrom with a grim smile, he placed {{it in his own}} girdle, and riding up to the Indian, sternly bade him mount in front of him.|$|E
