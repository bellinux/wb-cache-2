50|$|In 2009, the Government {{accepted}} 33 of the 64 recommendations unreservedly, with {{an additional}} 12 agreed to after further discussion. A qualified response was given to 11: for <b>example</b> <b>NZ</b> agreed with the “underlying premise” of recommendation 21 “to continue the public discussion {{on the status of}} the Treaty of Waitangi”, though NZ did “not assume that the current mechanisms in place were inadequate or that entrenchment of the Treaty is the only possible outcome”. Eight were rejected. Three of these related to International Labour Organisation conventions, which NZ believes are inconsistent with NZ’s “unique legal, constitutional and Treaty of Waitangi arrangements.” The HRC formally adopted the outcomes of NZ’s UPR on 24 September 2009.|$|R
50|$|There {{are almost}} 50 small century-old seaside baches on the coastal strip between Hobsons Bay to the north, and Boulder Bay to the south. Some were cave baches, with Whare Moki being {{considered}} the oldest surviving <b>example</b> in <b>NZ.</b> Most of the baches were in 1995 or 2016 recognised as heritage assets by either Heritage NZ {{or by the}} Christchurch City Council under the resource management act.|$|R
5000|$|The Territorial Force (TF), {{the long}} {{established}} reserve {{component of the}} New Zealand Army, has as of 2009-2010 been renamed the Army Reserve, in line with other Commonwealth countries, though the term [...] "Territorial Force" [...] remains the official nomenclature in the Defence Act 1990. It provides individual augmentees and formed bodies for operational deployments. There are Reserve units throughout New Zealand, {{and they have a}} long history. The modern Army Reserve is divided into three regionally-based battalion groups. Each of these is made up of smaller units of different specialities. The terms 'regiment' and 'battalion group' seem to be interchangeably used, which can cause confusion. However, {{it can be argued that}} both are accurate in slightly different senses. In a tactical sense, given that the Reserve units are groupings of all arms, the term 'battalion group' is accurate, though usually used for a much more single-arm heavy grouping, three infantry companies plus one armoured squadron, for <b>example.</b> <b>NZ</b> reserve battalion groups are composed of a large number of small units of different types.|$|R
25|$|The best <b>example</b> of <b>NZ's</b> two star players (R. Hadlee and M. Crowe) {{putting in}} match winning {{performances}} and other players making good contributions is NZ v Australia, 1985 at Brisbane. In Australia's first innings Hadlee took 9–52. In NZ's only turn at bat, M Crowe scored 188 and John F. Reid 108. Edgar, Wright, Coney, Jeff Crowe, V. Brown, and Hadlee scored between 17 and 54*. In Australia's second innings, Hadlee took 6–71 and Chatfield 3–75. NZ won by an innings and 41 runs.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the issues surrounding gender pay gaps {{focusing on the}} Information Communication Technology (ICT) sector of the labour market. Reporting on research conducted in the UK and New Zealand (NZ) we adopted a mixed method approach using comparable qualitative and quantitative research techniques to investigate pay issues amongst women working in ICT in the UK and NZ. Our findings reveal commonalities of experience and some interesting differences. Unlike with the UK sample, for <b>example,</b> in <b>NZ</b> women working in ICT {{do not believe that}} their pay reflects their workload, skills and their position within their own organisation. Our study found that non‐transparent pay and reward systems and salary secrets exacerbate inequality and discrimination in the UK and NZ. The paper concludes by offering some policy directions to encourage a narrowing of the gender pay gap and reflects on the benefits of doing cross‐national research...|$|R
40|$|Since a {{unit vector}} n is a point on the unit sphere, any {{one-dimensional}} liquid crystal configuratior n(z), a ≤ z ≤ b, generates a path on the unit sphere. In order to see what configurations are stable, we map the unit sphere onto a surface G having the property that equilibrium configurations of a nematic liquid crystal map into geodesic lines on the surface (geodesics). The shape of the surface depends on the elastic constant ratios k 1 /k 3 and k 2 /k 3, and is a sphere when all three constants are equal. A picture or model of the surface for a particular material is helpful in visualizing the equilibrium configurations that correspond to prescribed boundary conditions n(a) and n(b), and in studying their energy and stability. For <b>example,</b> a configuration <b>n(z)</b> is in stable equilibrium {{if and only if}} the path on G is a curve of least length among nearby curves having the same end points, and arc length ds on G is proportional to dz. The physical interpretation of the proportionality of ds to dz is that the elastic free energy density of the liquid crystal is a constant, independent of z...|$|R
40|$|In Bavaria, Germany {{and in the}} South Island of New Zealand {{indigenous}} beech forests comprise large landscape units. In Germany {{almost all}} of this forest is under silvicultural management, nature conservation being of only secondary concern. The reverse is true for NZ beech forests. The two attitudes of managing beech, one which attempts to integrate conservational concern into multi-purpose silviculture {{and the other in}} which the two management goals are segregated to different land areas represent different belief systems and paradigms with respect to the valuation of ecosystems. Seen from within forestry, the differences in valuation and belief appear as external and cannot be put to empirical test or consistency constraints. Here I suggest that a more comprehensive classification scheme based on modelling assumptions rather than on utilization goals offers a better way to clarify such valuation conflicts. In one modelling paradigm of ecosystems predictive tasks are selected as focal points and in the other evaluative tasks of management act as focal points. Between these extremes it is possible to map the positions that become publicly expressed about the issues of conservation and timber use. In this classification scheme Bavaria and NZ in the past represented two very different attitudes, but were consistent with their respective environmental and cultural histories. Recently Bavaria seems to follow the <b>NZ</b> <b>example</b> and in a sense is switching between extremes. This change puts the continuation of Bavarian silvicultural culture and competence at risk...|$|R
40|$|In {{connection}} with another investigation concerned with strain variations (Hildebrand ms.) some growth rate studies {{were made of}} several isolates of the fire-blight organism, Erwinia amylovora. For purposes of comparison similar studies were also made {{of a number of}} Phytomonas species and, because of the paucity of such data in phytopathological literature, it was thought worthwhile to report briefly the results. In these studies the period of lag, or the latent period through which a freshly inoculated bacterial culture passes before enter-ing its period of rapid growth, was largely eliminated by making from one to three transfers of the test bacteria at daily intervals before starting the experiment. For the actual measurement, 1 cc. of a 1 : 10, 000 dilution of these young cultures was transferred to 100 cc. of nutrient broth (pH = 6. 6). Nutrient agar (pH = 6. 6) was largely used for the plate counts. In a few instances, indicated later, special media in liquid and solid form were employed (nutrient-glucose, potato-glucose, and potato-mannitol containing 0. 5 per cent glucose or mannitol). Tests were made of 14 different isolates of the fire-blight or-ganism. The culture numbers are abbreviations of the states or countries serving as sources. For <b>example,</b> the symbol <b>NZ</b> 7 represents the seventh of a series of cultures obtained from New Zealand and NZ 7 d represents a culture which is the progeny of the fourth or "d " single cell isolated from the above culture.

50|$|Many science {{festivals and}} other public events running over {{multiple}} days placed particular emphasis {{on the theme of}} light during 2015.  Such large scale visibility brought the important messages of the year to millions. A selection of highlights gives a flavour of the diversity of such events, and illustrates also how the international aspects of IYL 2015 could be sometimes effectively linked with national themes.In New Zealand, for <b>example,</b> the Illuminating <b>NZ</b> celebration began in mid-winter to coincide with the Māori New Year Matariki (heralded by the appearance of the Pleiades on the horizon) and closed with a 9-day celebration of the coming of spring: Te Kōanga. The event programme involved thousands of participants of all ages and included art, music, and science activities. In the Philippines, a two-day public symposium IlumiNASYON from 9-16 March 2015 highlighted optics in the arts, science, and in Philippine history and culture. And in Mozambique, events in Maputo celebrating IYL 2015 were held on 10 November 2015 to coincide with celebrations of the city’s founding.Many large scale events took place in Europe during 2015. An exhibition Discover the Power of Light! organised by the Vrije Universiteit Brussel attracted 270,000 visitors to the iconic Atomium Centre in Brussels. The European Researchers' Night on 25 September 2015 in 24 countries attracted over 1.1 million visitors, and many activities used the theme of light to align with IYL 2015. One notable example is CERN’s activities on light and poetry.  The art festival Nuit Blanche was organized in Bratislava on 10 October 2015, and together with the Festival of Light (10-12 October 2015) attracted 100,000 people to the streets of the Slovak capital. The science festival organised by the German Physical Society (DPG) and the Federal Ministry of Research in Jena, attracted more than 53,000 visitors from 27 September-1 October 2015. The Athens Science Festival celebrated from 17-22 March 2015 chose as its main theme light and its applications, and attracted 33,000 participants, including 8,000 students.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} question for this masters project was {{what are the}} impacts of ICT provision in Miranda as an <b>example</b> of rural <b>NZ?</b> In order {{to answer this question}} firstly the ICT provision in Miranda needed to be assessed. Secondly, it was necessary to examine the issues or problems associated with connecting to the Internet in rural area. Thirdly, evaluation, assessment, and estimation of the potentials of providing broadband in this area were required. The final question was what is required to make broadband available in Miranda? The cost for upgrading telecommunications infrastructure is also required. This study looks at several aspects of urban-rural “digital divide” including broadband, applications and content. Many scholars argue that the term digital divide should include social and economic as well as technological aspects. This research looked at the ICT provision in rural New Zealand, concentrated on Miranda, and surrounding for this qualitative study. Eight randomly selected participants, who lived or worked in this area were interviewed. This study looked at the main four cultural factors affecting ICT provision in rural areas: technological, political, economic, and social. These four factors are also discussed with respect to the New Zealand government’s (including its agencies) contribution, in order to bridge the divide that exists between urban and rural. The research identified three main stakeholders: The New Zealand Government, ISPs, and residents in rural areas. The research has been organised into chapters describing the steps followed in this research project. An interpretative framework and the methodology undertaken in the analysis phase is also described and used to interpret results. What are the impacts of ICT provision in rural New Zealand? Firstly, technical, improvements to the telecommunications infrastructure in rural areas is required. Secondly, politically, the digital divide in rural areas needs to be integrated into the New Zealand fabric as a whole. Thirdly, economic, benefits, for instance in dairy manufacturing sector that forms more that 60 % of New Zealand’s economy, are required. Rural ICT provision should give farmers added value to current farming practices. Fourthly, social, improvement in ICT for rural education, medical and other social services should improve the wellbeing of citizens in rural areas. This research is a single study design based on grounded theory within the Community Informatics research framework. This is characterised by factors that empower democracy, boost social capital, empower individuals, and restore a sense of economic development (O’Neil, 2001). In addition to these characteristics, this study’s results revealed that in fact this research increased and deepened the participants’ knowledge of ICT provision in this area. Gurstein (2006) concluded, “Research is not generally done simply for the research itself. It is usually done in relation to a specific outcome or action in the world of practice and {{what this means is that}} the research use is generally to be built into the research design itself ” (Gurstein, 2006, p. 20) ...|$|R
