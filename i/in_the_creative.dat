5|$|There {{has also}} been a general feeling of a shift <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>creative</b> {{attribution}} of Peking-opera works. The performer has traditionally played a large role in the scripting and staging of Peking-opera works.

Performers have striven to introduce innovation in their work while heeding the call for reform from this new upper level of Peking-opera producers.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{started in}} August 2006 at the Wikimania 2006 conference, and by April 2007 {{the team had}} {{aggregated}} 100 hours of footage.

Hill took a two-person film crew and traveled to China, Indonesia, India, South Africa, Australia and Europe, interviewing editors and contributors. Hill is himself an editor of Wikipedia, starting an article about a graffiti artist. Gibson and Hill required expertise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>creative</b> and funding aspects of film-making and invited Scott Glosserman to join the venture. Glosserman's involvement with the film began during the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. After Glosserman signed on, {{the breadth of the}} endeavor became larger.

Juventus won the Serie B title that season, earning promotion to Serie A the following season.|$|E

Reubens had {{originally}} {{agreed to do}} two more seasons after the third, and when CBS asked Reubens {{about the possibility of}} a sixth season he declined, wanting to take a sabbatical. Reubens had been suffering from burnout from playing Pee-wee full-time and had been warning that Pee-wee was temporary and that he had other ideas he would like to work on. The parties agreed to end the show after five seasons, which included 45 episodes and a Christmas Special.

5|$|Prior to the {{creation}} of Burnout 3: Takedown, UK-based development studio Criterion had been collaborating with publisher Electronic Arts (EA) on a skating video game. However, disagreements over the game's creative direction led to its cancellation and falling out between the two companies. EA later approached Criterion about reuniting and partnering on a game, and so Criterion began developing Burnout 3: Takedown in June 2004 on the condition that EA would not interfere <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>creative</b> process. Over a year later, EA acquired Criterion and the Burnout series; their high expectations for Burnout 3: Takedown was influential in the acquisition. The game launched in September 2004 on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox video game consoles.|$|E

5|$|Carnivàle is an American {{television}} series that aired on HBO between 2003 and 2005. Created by Daniel Knauf, the show traces the disparate storylines {{of a young}} carnival worker named Ben Hawkins (played by Nick Stahl) and a preacher in California named Brother Justin Crowe (Clancy Brown) during the United States Dust Bowl. Although Carnivàle was praised for its production and art style, the unfolding story proved too inaccessible for the general audience {{and led to the}} show's cancellation after two of six planned seasons. The inaugural season of Carnivàle garnered numerous awards and nominations, including five Emmy Awards and two Emmy nominations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>creative</b> arts categories. The second season received eight Emmy nominations. Nominations for two Golden Reel Awards, four Satellite Awards and two Saturn Awards did not result in a win. The only actor of Carnivàles large main cast to win an award was Adrienne Barbeau ("Ruthie") with a WIN Award (Women's Image Network Awards). Overall, Carnivàle has received nine awards from twenty-one nominations.|$|E
5|$|The Eye of Ra or Eye of Re is a {{being in}} ancient Egyptian mythology that {{functions}} as a feminine counterpart to the sun god Ra and a violent force that subdues his enemies. The Eye {{is an extension of}} Ra's power, equated with the disk of the sun, but it also behaves as an independent entity, which can be personified by a wide variety of Egyptian goddesses, including Hathor, Sekhmet, Bastet, Wadjet, and Mut. The Eye goddess acts as mother, sibling, consort, and daughter of the sun god. She is his partner <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>creative</b> cycle in which he begets the renewed form of himself that is born at dawn. The Eye's violent aspect defends Ra against the agents of disorder that threaten his rule. This dangerous aspect of the Eye goddess is often represented by a lioness or by the uraeus, or cobra, a symbol of protection and royal authority. The Eye of Ra is similar to the Eye of Horus, which belongs to a different god, Horus, but represents many of the same concepts. The disastrous effects when the Eye goddess rampages out of control and the efforts of the gods to return her to a benign state are a prominent motif in Egyptian mythology.|$|E
5|$|The {{program was}} {{directed}} by Daniel De Felippo and Rodolfo Antúnez, and produced by César Markus González. Most of the filming occurred {{at the headquarters of}} Pol-ka in the Colegiales neighborhood. The telenovela took several risks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>creative</b> and production fields, which were mostly successful. The choice of Martín Quesada's background as a Formula 1 driver required an area with a large infrastructure to represent realistic races. For realism, plot scenes set outside Buenos Aires were actually filmed outside the city. There was significant press coverage during the location shooting in Germany, which took place during the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Facundo Arana and Natalia Oreiro played their characters in the Veltins-Arena stadium during the Argentina-Serbia and Montenegro match. The result of the matcha 6–0 Argentine victorybenefited the filming, and the episode received 31.5 rating points. Location shooting also occurred in the tourist ski resort Las Leñas in the Andes. A simulated aircraft crash that left the characters in a jungle was filmed at the Pereyra Iraola park and an Argentine Air Force park in Morón.|$|E
