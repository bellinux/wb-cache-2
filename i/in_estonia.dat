5|$|In 2002, about 97% of air {{pollution}}, 86% {{of total}} waste and 23% of water pollution <b>in</b> <b>Estonia</b> {{came from the}} power industry, which uses oil shale as the main resource for its power production.|$|E
5|$|Oil shale {{serves as}} the main fuel for power {{generation}} only <b>in</b> <b>Estonia,</b> where the oil-shale-fired Narva Power Plants accounted for 95% of country's electrical generation in 2005.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two kinds}} of oil shale <b>in</b> <b>Estonia,</b> both of which are {{sedimentary}} rocks laid down during the Ordovician geologic period. Graptolitic argillite is the larger resource, but, because its organic matter content is relatively low, it is not used industrially. The other one is kukersite, which has been mined for almost a hundred years and is expected to last for another 25–30years. By the end of 2012, the total kukersite resource was 4.8billion tonnes, of which up to 650million tonnes was recoverable. Kukersite deposits <b>in</b> <b>Estonia</b> account for 1.1% of global oil shale deposits.|$|E

5|$|As of 2010, major long-standing {{extraction}} {{industries are}} operating <b>in</b> <b>Estonia,</b> Brazil, and China. Its economic viability usually requires {{a lack of}} locally available crude oil. National energy security issues have {{also played a role}} in its development. Critics of shale oil extraction pose questions about environmental management issues, such as waste disposal, extensive water use, waste water management, and air pollution.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II, the {{oil shale}} {{industry}} declined due {{to the discovery of}} large supplies of easily accessible and cheaper crude oil. Oil shale production however, continued to grow <b>in</b> <b>Estonia,</b> Russia and China.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, 70% of {{oil shale}} mined <b>in</b> <b>Estonia</b> {{was used for}} power generation, and about 85% of Estonia's {{electricity}} was generated from oil shale. About 29% of produced electricity was exported to Finland, Latvia, and Lithuania.|$|E

5|$|Oil shale is {{used for}} cement {{production}} by Kunda Nordic Cement <b>in</b> <b>Estonia,</b> by Holcim in Germany, and by Fushun cement factory in China.

However, use of oil shale for production of these products is still very rare and in experimental stages only.|$|E

5|$|The National Development Plan for the Utilisation of Oil Shale 2008–2015 {{describes}} {{oil shale}} {{as a strategic}} energy resource.

5|$|While Soviet {{troops were}} {{advancing}} into Estonia during 1944, about 200Estonian oil shale specialists were evacuated to Schömberg, Germany, {{to work at}} an oil shale industry there, codenamed Operation Desert (Unternehmen Wüste).

5|$|In 1885, a nova-like {{outburst}} {{was observed}} {{in the direction of}} the Andromeda galaxy by Ernst Hartwig <b>in</b> <b>Estonia.</b> S Andromedae increased to 6th magnitude, outshining the entire nucleus of the galaxy, then faded in a manner much like a nova. In 1917, George W. Ritchey measured the distance to the Andromeda Galaxy and discovered it lay much farther than had previously been thought. This meant that S Andromedae, which did not just lie along the line of sight to the galaxy but had actually resided in the nucleus, released a much greater amount of energy than was typical for a nova.|$|E
