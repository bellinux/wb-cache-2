25|$|Because the {{quarter-wave plate}} {{is made of}} a {{birefringent}} material, when in the wave plate, the light travels at different speeds depending on the direction of its electric field. This means that the <b>horizontal</b> <b>component</b> which is along the slow axis of the wave plate will travel at a slower speed than the component that is directed along the vertical fast axis. Initially the two components are in phase, but as the two components travel through the wave plate the <b>horizontal</b> <b>component</b> of the light drifts farther behind that of the vertical. By adjusting {{the thickness of the}} wave plate one can control how much the <b>horizontal</b> <b>component</b> is delayed relative to vertical component before the light leaves the wave plate and they begin again to travel at the same speed. When the light leaves the quarter-wave plate the rightward <b>horizontal</b> <b>component</b> will be exactly one quarter of a wavelength behind the vertical component making the light left-hand circularly polarized when viewed from the receiver.|$|E
25|$|Had it been right-handed, {{clockwise}} {{circularly polarized}} light approaching the circular polarizer from the left, its <b>horizontal</b> <b>component</b> would {{have also been}} retarded, however the resulting linearly polarized light would have been polarized along the absorbing axis of the linear polarizer {{and it would not}} have passed.|$|E
30|$|From {{expression}} (12), {{it follows}} that, if {{there exists a}} depth gradient, then the <b>horizontal</b> <b>components</b> of acceleration are capable of providing an additional contribution to pressure at the ocean bottom. The contribution of <b>horizontal</b> <b>components</b> {{is proportional to the}} inclination of the bottom, which actually rarely exceeds 0.1. Consequently, in spite of <b>horizontal</b> <b>components</b> of acceleration in seismic waves usually being greater than the vertical components (Fig.  2), the contribution of horizontal accelerations to pressure variations is not to be expected to be dominant.|$|R

25|$|The next pair of {{illustrations}} {{is that of}} left-handed, counter-clockwise {{circularly polarized}} light when viewed by the receiver. Because it is left-handed, the rightward (relative to the direction of travel) <b>horizontal</b> <b>component</b> is now lagging the vertical component by one quarter of a wavelength rather than leading it.|$|E
25|$|Now, if we're given a {{vector field}} Y over M (but not the {{principal}} bundle) {{but we also}} have a connection over the principal bundle, we can define a vector field X over the principal bundle such that its <b>horizontal</b> <b>component</b> matches Y and its vertical component agrees with the connection. This is the covariant Lie derivative.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{relatively}} straightforward way to appreciate why a polarizer which creates a given handedness of circularly polarized light also passes that same handedness of polarized light. First, given the dual usefulness of this image, begin by imagining the circularly polarized light displayed at the top as still leaving the quarter-wave plate and traveling toward the left. Observe that had the <b>horizontal</b> <b>component</b> of the linearly polarized light been retarded by a quarter of wavelength twice, which would amount to a full half wavelength, the result would have been linearly polarized light that was at a right angle to the light that entered. If such orthogonally polarized light were rotated on the horizontal plane and directed back through the linear polarizer section of the circular polarizer it would clearly pass through given its orientation. Now imagine the circularly polarized light which has already passed through the quarter-wave plate once, turned around and directed back toward the circular polarizer again. Let the circularly polarized light illustrated at the top now represent that light. Such light is going to travel through the quarter-wave plate a second time before reaching the linear polarizer and in the process, its <b>horizontal</b> <b>component</b> {{is going to be}} retarded a second time by one quarter of a wavelength. Whether that <b>horizontal</b> <b>component</b> is retarded by one quarter of a wavelength in two distinct steps or retarded a full half wavelength all at once, the orientation of the resulting linearly polarized light will be such that it passes through the linear polarizer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The Chi-Chi {{earthquake}} supplied us unprecedented {{information on}} near-fault ground motions {{and made it}} possible to study the randomness of near-fault ground motions in assembly. From the viewpoint of random function, response spec-tra of 30 stations under similar conditions are used as the samples of three random functions. The mean value functions, autocorrelation, and cross-correlation matrixes of response spectra are studied. According to this study, the response spectra of three components are all the nonstationary functions. The spectra characteristics of two <b>horizontal</b> <b>components</b> are similar in statistical meaning, but there are certain differ-ences in randomness. There are considerable differences between randomness of response spectra of vertical <b>component</b> and <b>horizontal</b> <b>components.</b> It can be seen that during the period range from 0. 1 to 4 sec, which is the most commonly inves-tigated period range in engineering practice, the autocorrelation and cross-correlation matrixes of response spectra of two <b>horizontal</b> <b>components</b> have roughly diamond-like shapes; however, it is not the case for the autocorrelation matrixes of vertical component and cross-correlation matrixes of vertical to <b>horizontal</b> <b>components,</b> which are irregular in general. In this article, a primary mathematic model is estab-lished to simulate the autocorrelation matrixes and cross-correlation matrixes of re-sponse spectra of two <b>horizontal</b> <b>components,</b> which paves a way for further study in the randomness of response spectra...|$|R
25|$|There {{are other}} {{components}} of the Coriolis effect. Westward-travelling objects are deflected downwards (feel heavier), while Eastward-travelling objects are deflected upwards (feel lighter). This {{is known as the}} Eötvös effect. This aspect of the Coriolis effect is greatest near the equator. The force produced by this effect is similar to the <b>horizontal</b> <b>component,</b> but the much larger vertical forces due to gravity and pressure mean that it is generally unimportant dynamically.|$|E
25|$|Maclaurin used Newton's {{theory to}} show that a smooth sphere covered by a {{sufficiently}} deep ocean under the tidal force of a single deforming body is a prolate spheroid (essentially a three-dimensional oval) with major axis directed toward the deforming body. Maclaurin was the first to write about the Earth's rotational effects on motion. Euler realized that the tidal force's <b>horizontal</b> <b>component</b> (more than the vertical) drives the tide. In 1744 Jean le Rond d'Alembert studied tidal equations for the atmosphere which did not include rotation.|$|E
25|$|To {{understand}} this process, {{refer to the}} illustration on the right. It is absolutely identical to the earlier illustration even though the circularly polarized light at the top is now considered to be approaching the polarizer from the left. One can observe from the illustration that the leftward horizontal (as observed looking along the direction of travel) component is leading the vertical component and that when the <b>horizontal</b> <b>component</b> is retarded by one quarter of a wavelength it will be transformed into the linearly polarized light illustrated {{at the bottom and}} it will pass through the linear polarizer.|$|E

25|$|As {{the angle}} of bank θ {{approaches}} 90°, the tangent function approaches infinity, allowing larger values for |v|2/r. In words, this equation states that for faster speeds (bigger |v|) the road must be banked more steeply (a larger value for θ), and for sharper turns (smaller r) the road also must be banked more steeply, which accords with intuition. When the angle θ does not satisfy the above condition, the <b>horizontal</b> <b>component</b> of force exerted by the road does not provide the correct centripetal force, and an additional frictional force tangential to the road surface is called upon to provide the difference. If friction cannot do this (that is, the coefficient of friction is exceeded), the ball slides to a different radius where the balance can be realized.|$|E

2500|$|The {{nature of}} {{circular}} polarization {{and its relationship}} to other polarizations is often understood by thinking of the electric field as being divided into two components which are at right angles to each other.

Notice that the rightward (relative to the direction of travel) <b>horizontal</b> <b>component</b> leads the vertical component by one quarter of a wavelength. It is this quadrature phase relationship which creates the helix and causes the points of maximum magnitude of the vertical component to correspond with the points of zero magnitude of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>component,</b> and vice versa.
