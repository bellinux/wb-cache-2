5|$|This {{incident}} {{was used as}} evidence for Boycott's selfish attitude for many years after. His highest score was 142 not out in the second innings of the Fourth Test at Sydney, in a 299-run victory. The Fifth Test was drawn, Boycott making 12 and 76*, and in the Sixth Test he was run out for 58. Boycott initially refused to leave the ground in <b>disbelief,</b> <b>and</b> eventually walked off to jeering from the crowd. He made 119 in the second innings but injured his arm against fast bowler Garth McKenzie in a following one day match and missed the final Test, when England retained the Ashes. He later maintained that the injury permanently affected his wrist, and that he carried a squash ball in a sock in his pocket, which he could squeeze to keep his wrist strong. He ended the series with 657 Test runs at 93.85.|$|E

5|$|In early 1944, Freyberg {{was made}} {{commander}} of the New Zealand Corps, newly formed for the Battle of Monte Cassino, while Kippenberger was promoted to temporary major-general and made {{commander of the}} 2nd Division. This was the pinnacle of his military career. The division had moved into the line around Cassino, replacing the U.S. 36th Infantry Division, which had been attacking the strongly defended German positions. The first attack by the New Zealanders on 17 February was unsuccessful despite {{the bombing of the}} Monte Cassino abbey, which Kippenberger supported. A second attack was planned for 20 February, but it was delayed by bad weather. On 2 March, Kippenberger climbed the slopes of nearby Mount Trocchio to gain an overview of the Cassino battlefield. Near the top of the mountain, he triggered a land mine which exploded and injured both legs to the extent that one foot was severed in the blast. He was evacuated to a medical centre, and the other foot and the lower portions of both legs were amputated. When the news of his injuries spread to the men of the 2nd New Zealand Division, it was met with some <b>disbelief</b> <b>and</b> shock, greatly affecting morale.|$|E
5|$|The strike {{involved}} {{three of}} the province's four major copper mines: the mines at Mufulira, Nkana and Roan Antelope. On the morning of 21 May 1935, police at Mulfulira announced that taxes were raised from 12 to 15 shillings a year. The strike was spontaneous, with morning-shift miners refusing to go underground. It was led by three Zambians from the Northern Province: William Sankata, Ngostino Mwamba and James Mutali at the Mufulira mine. The other African miners refused to report to work, shouted slogans against the authorities and threw stones at them and non-supportive Africans. At the other two mines, the strike was less spontaneous than at Mufulira (where the tax increase was received with <b>disbelief)</b> <b>and</b> police arrested leaders as a precautionary measure. News of the Mufulira strike spread {{to the other two}} mines with the inflow of miners from Mufulira. Beni dancers, who developed the dance form during the colonial era and who mimicked military and colonial administration with music and aesthetic expression, were instrumental in structured communication during the strike. African workers went on strike in Nkana on 27 May, but it failed and ended the following day due to poor leadership. The strike at Roan Antelope, where some tribal leaders participated, turned violent. On 29 May, a large crowd gathered around the compound containing police, officials, clerks and elders; protesters began throwing stones and shouting slogans. The police panicked and fired, leading to the deaths of six protesters and injuring 17 others. Shocked at the shootout, the strikers called off the strike. According to a UNESCO International Scientific Committee report, organized demonstrations were held on 22 May at the Mulfra mine and spread to Nkana on 26 May and the Luansha mines on 28 May. Casualties were reported as 28 killed or injured, with an unspecified number of arrests.|$|E

25|$|While many Jews {{reacted to}} their fate with <b>disbelief</b> <b>and</b> passivity, revolts did take place, {{including}} at the Treblinka and Sobibór camps {{and at a}} number of ghettos. The leftist ŻOB was established in the Warsaw Ghetto in July 1942 and was soon commanded by Mordechai Anielewicz. As the final liquidation of the remaining ghetto population was commenced by the Nazis on 19 April 1943, hundreds of Jewish fighters revolted. The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising lasted until May 16 and resulted in thousands of Jews killed and tens of thousands transported to Treblinka. The Polish underground and some Warsaw residents assisted the ghetto fighters.|$|E
25|$|The {{incident}} was largely met with <b>disbelief</b> <b>and</b> {{laughter from the}} passengers {{and some of the}} flight attendants, as they thought it was an exercise. Passengers described two of the hijackers as calm and with a good comprehension of Swedish, while one was clearly nervous and did not understand Swedish. The hijackers calmly answered questions regarding the action and stated that they intended to have the ambassador's murderer released. They then started making references to the Munich massacre ten days earlier and hinted that a similar situation could arise in the aircraft. Passengers described the hijackers as generally friendly.|$|E

500|$|Russell then {{inquires}} {{into the}} power that reason has over a community, as contrasted with fanaticism. It {{would seem that the}} power of reason is that it is able to increase the odds of success in practical matters by way of technical efficiency. The cost of allowing for reasoned inquiry is the tolerance of intellectual disagreement, which in turn provokes scepticism and dims the power of fanaticism. Conversely, it would seem that a community is stronger and more cohesive if there is widespread agreement within it over certain creeds, and reasoned debate is rare. If these two opposing conditions are both to be fully exploited for short-term gains, then it would demand two things: first, that some creed be held both by the majority opinion (through force and propaganda), and second, that the majority of intellectual class concurs (through reasoned discussion). In the long-term, however, creeds tend to provoke weariness, light scepticism, outright <b>disbelief,</b> <b>and</b> finally, apathy. (Russell 1938:123–125) ...|$|E
500|$|Lichtenstein uses red Ben-Day dots {{to color}} Mickey's face. According to some art critics, {{this gives the}} {{character}} the appearance of blushing.

Another interpretation – supported by the original source in which Mickey says that if Donald can land the fish he can have it for lunch – is that Mickey's face is red due to the exertion necessary to contain his <b>disbelief</b> <b>and</b> laughter while he experiences his amused superiority. Those adhering to the blushing interpretation are bolstered by the uneven blotchiness of the red dots, but others {{are quick to point out}} that Lichtenstein's Ben-Day dot technique was still in a primitive stage.

40|$|Abstract. Inconsistency {{normally}} {{arises when}} using Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) systems. As these systems aim {{to solve problems}} using previously recorded situations, real applications frequently present cases that, even starting from similar premisses, lead to different conclusions. In this work we propose an automatic {{way of dealing with}} the inconsistency problem in CBRs. We employ the Evidential Logic (EL) formalism, a special case of the Paraconsistent Logics, which admit inconsistent but non-trivial theories. In EL belief <b>and</b> <b>disbelief</b> evidential factors are associated to formulas or, in CBRs context, to each case. We automatically calculate these factors by applying the well-known Machine Learning Naïve-Bayes algorithm to the case base. The overall proposal is tested in a CBR platform that employs the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm: the solution of an unseen case is obtained as the “closest ” one in the case base given by k-NN. We test our proposal using six different rules for combining belief <b>and</b> <b>disbelief</b> factors <b>and</b> the distances given by k-NN, in nine databases from the UCI Machine Learning repository. Obtained results indicate the utility of our proposal in practical applications. Keywords: Case-base reasoning, Inconsistency treatment, Paraconsistent Logic...|$|R
