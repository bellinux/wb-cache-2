25|$|One {{well-known}} {{issue is}} contamination deposition on the resist from ambient or outgassed hydrocarbons, which results from EUV- or electron-driven reactions. Also, hydrogen gas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> chambers interacts with tin {{in the light}} source or resist to form SnH4 which reaches the coatings of the EUV optical surfaces, leaving Sn which is subsequently unremovable. Hydrogen also reacts with metal-containing compounds to reduce them to metal, and/or diffuses through to the multilayer, eventually causing blistering. Hydrogen also reacts with resists to etch or decompose them.|$|E

25|$|The {{plunge depth}} {{is defined as}} the depth of the lowest point of the {{shoulder}} {{below the surface of the}} welded plate and has been found to be a critical parameter for ensuring weld quality. Plunging the shoulder below the plate surface increases the pressure below the tool and helps ensure adequate forging of the material at the rear of the tool. Tilting the tool by 2–4 degrees, such that the rear of the tool is lower than the front, has been found to assist this forging process. The plunge depth needs to be correctly set, both to ensure the necessary downward pressure is achieved and to ensure that the tool fully penetrates the weld. Given the high loads required, the welding machine may deflect and so reduce the plunge depth compared to the nominal setting, which may result in flaws in the weld. On the other hand, an excessive plunge depth may result in the pin rubbing on the backing plate surface or a significant undermatch of the weld thickness compared to the base material. Variable load welders have been developed to automatically compensate for changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> displacement while TWI have demonstrated a roller system that maintains the tool position above the weld plate.|$|E

500|$|Cubic {{boron nitride}} (CBN or c-BN) {{is widely used}} as an abrasive. Its {{usefulness}} arises from its insolubility in iron, nickel, and related alloys at high temperatures, whereas diamond is soluble in these metals to give carbides. Polycrystalline c-BN (PCBN) abrasives are therefore used for machining steel, whereas diamond abrasives are preferred for aluminum alloys, ceramics, and stone. When in contact with oxygen at high temperatures, BN forms a passivation layer of boron oxide. Boron nitride binds well with metals, due to formation of interlayers of metal borides or nitrides. Materials with cubic boron nitride crystals are often used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool</b> bits of cutting tools. For grinding applications, softer binders, e.g. resin, porous ceramics, and soft metals, are used. Ceramic binders {{can be used as}} well.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} an improvement to gesture reconstruction with a computer-writing tool {{based on an}} inertial principle. <b>The</b> computer-writing <b>tool</b> is modified with a complete, miniaturized, six degrees-of-freedom inertial measurement unit {{in order to reduce}} <b>the</b> error <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool’s</b> orientation with respect to the reference coordinate system and, consequently, to reduce <b>the</b> error <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tool’s</b> tip position on the paper. The improvement is achieved by calibrating the inertial measurement unit using advanced modeling of the nonlinear voltage output of a triple-axis low-g MEMS accelerometer. The nonlinear accelerometer’s model considers an interacting influence between the measuring axes of the arbitrarily oriented writing tool.

2500|$|The UK {{government}} {{claims that}} a sustained cull, conducted {{over a wide}} area in a co-ordinated and efficient manner, {{over a period of}} nine years, might achieve a 9-16% reduction in disease incidence. However, many scientists and a coalition of animal-welfare groups including the RSPCA, the Wildlife Trusts and the RSPB, argue that a cull could risk local extermination of all badgers, and that a badger cull will not in any way solve the problem of bovine tuberculosis in cattle. The British Veterinary Association say that data collected from research in other countries, suggests that the control of the disease in farms has only been successfully carried out by dealing with both cattle and wild reservoirs of infection. However, in the introduction to the Final Report on the RBCT, the Chair of the Independent Scientific Group, John Bourne, states: [...] "Scientific findings indicate that the rising incidence of disease can be reversed, and geographical spread contained, by the rigid application of cattle-based control measures alone" [...] (2007, Bovine TB: The Scientific Evidence. Final Report of the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB,3-289).
