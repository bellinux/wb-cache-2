40|$|Information and {{communication}} technologies (ICT) {{have been growing}} rapidly in developed countries {{over the last five}} decades. ICT has been revolutionising the way in which people in these countries live and conduct their work. ICT has changed the administration, governance, education, business competitiveness and global operations in them. The developed countries consider ICT as much vaunted technology for increased socio-economic development and depend on the “knowledge economy ” for wealth creation. In contrast to the developed countries that have been steadily capitalising on the rapid pace of ICT, a large number of developing countries, particularly low-income countries have failed in the adaptation of these technologies thus contributing to the “digital-divide ” between the developed and developing countries. This is predominantly so in the rural villages in that modern technology has not reached to the institutions in rural villages. In other words, the majority of people living in rural areas has neither access nor the means to obtain modern ICT because of their low economic position. ICT can be implemented within the institutions in rural villages to <b>improve</b> <b>administrative</b> processes, increase <b>transparency</b> of activities making them accountable to the public, connect villagers to the administration and socio-economic development, increase their knowledge base through greater participation and deliver better services to improve their socio-economic conditions. However, this can be achieved only through the development of social and physical infrastructure within the government institutes and villages.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} cross-border financial externalities on moral hazards of the banking sector, and an international policy coordination mechanism to reduce the moral hazards of the banking sector considering cross-border financial externalities. We demonstrate that the moral hazard of banking, such as reducing the monitoring efforts, is aggravated by cross-border financial externalities, while the introduction of an international policy coordination mechanism might reduce the moral hazard caused by these externalities. Moreover, international policy coordination {{is less likely to}} be sustained when the policy maker is short-sighted and the banking sector has greater political influence. However, when the distortionary cost of a liquidity aids policy is lower with high <b>administrative</b> <b>transparency,</b> and cross-border financial externality is greater, the coordination mechanism {{is more likely to be}} sustained. The results imply that efforts to launch an effective international financial coordination mechanism should start with countries with higher <b>administrative</b> <b>transparency,</b> more political stability, and enhanced financial integration.
