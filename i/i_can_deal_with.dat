40|$|This paper {{presents}} a sum of squares (SOS) {{approach to the}} stability analysis of networked control systems (NCSs) incorporating bounded time-varying delays, bounded time-varying transmission intervals and a shared communication medium. A shared communication medium imposes that per transmission only one node, which consists of several actuators or sensors, can access the network and transmit its corresponding data. Which node obtains access is determined by a network protocol. We will provide mathematical models that describe these NCSs and transform them into suitable hybrid systems formulations. Based on these hybrid systems formulations we construct Lyapunov functions using SOS techniques that can be solved using LMI-based computations. This leads to several beneficial features: (<b>i)</b> we <b>can</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> plants and controllers which are described by nonlinear (piecewise) polynomial differential equations, (ii) we can allow for non-zero lower bounds on the delays and transmission intervals in contrast with various existing approaches, (iii) we allow more flexibility in the Lyapunov functions thereby obtaining less conservative estimates of the maximal allowable transmission intervals (MATI) and maximal allowable delay (MAD), and finally (iv) it provides an automated method to address stability analysis problems in NCS. Several numerical examples illustrate the strengths of our approach...|$|R

60|$|Such {{appear to}} me to be the broad {{outlines}} of the relations which the university, regarded as a place of education, ought to bear to the school, but a number of points of detail require some consideration, however briefly and imperfectly <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> them. In the first place, there is the important question of the limitations which should be fixed to the entrance into the university; or, what qualifications should be required of those who propose {{to take advantage of the}} higher training offered by the university. On the one hand, it is obviously desirable that the time and opportunities of the university should not be wasted in conferring such elementary instruction as can be obtained elsewhere; while, on the other hand, it is no less desirable that the higher instruction of the university should be made accessible to every one who can take advantage of it, although he may not have been able to go through any very extended course of education. My own feeling is distinctly against any absolute and defined preliminary examination, the passing of which shall be an essential condition of admission to the university. I would admit to the university any one who could be reasonably expected to profit by the instruction offered to him; and I should be inclined, on the whole, to test the fitness of the student, not by examination before he enters the university, but at the end of his first term of study. If, on examination in the branches of knowledge to which he has devoted himself, he show himself deficient in industry or in capacity, it will be best for the university and best for himself, to prevent him from pursuing a vocation for which he is obviously unfit. And I hardly know of any other method than this by which his fitness or unfitness can be safely ascertained, though no doubt a good deal may be done, not by formal cut and dried examination, but by judicious questioning, at the outset of his career.|$|E
6000|$|The nearest I {{have come}} to receipt or {{possession}} of the interesting volumes you have so generously in mind is to have had Bernstein's assurance, when I met him here some time since, that he would give himself the delight of sending me the Proust production, which he learned from me that I hadn't seen. I tried to dissuade him from this excess, but nothing would serve--he was too yearningly bent upon it, and we parted with his asseveration that I might absolutely count on this tribute both to poor Proust's charms and to my own.

In writing on such a subject, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> the whole as a whole. During my stay in the country, I did my best to make myself acquainted with the nature of its newspapers, knowing in how great a degree its population depends on them for its daily store of information; for newspapers in the States of America have a much wider, or rather closer circulation, than they do with us. Every man and almost every woman sees a newspaper daily. They are very cheap, and are brought to every man's hand, without trouble to himself, at every turn that he takes in his day's work. It would be much for the advantage of the country that they should be good of their kind; but, if I am able to form any judgment on the matter, they are not good.|$|R
60|$|The first {{answer is}} simply to say that I am a rationalist. I like to have some {{intellectual}} justification for my intuitions.

But I am in this matter yet more definitely a rationalist. I do not propose to turn this book into one of ordinary Christian apologetics; I should be glad to meet at any other time the enemies of Christianity in that more obvious arena. Here I am only giving an account of my own growth in spiritual certainty. But I may pause to remark that the more I saw of the merely abstract arguments against the Christian cosmology the less I thought of them. I mean that having found the moral atmosphere of the Incarnation to be common sense, I then looked at the established intellectual arguments against the Incarnation and found them to be common nonsense. In case the argument should be thought to suffer from the absence of the ordinary apologetic I will here very briefly summarise my own arguments and conclusions on the purely objective or scientific truth of the matter.|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 49 - 50) Many therapists {{express a}} dislike {{to working with}} children, specifically adolescents and teenagers, in a formal therapy setting. Such comments as ???You couldn???t pay me enough to work with kids??? or ???<b>I</b> <b>can</b> barely <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> my own kids, much less someone else???s!??? serve {{as an indication of}} this aversion. The purpose of this project is to provide a handbook for therapists who wish to work with adolescents and teenagers. To this end, a review was done on relevant literature focusing on ???resilient adolescents??? and ???natural mentors??? in an effort to ascertain concrete methods through which a therapist may build a strong, positive therapeutic relationship with a teenage or adolescent client. Much of the information contained herein is sourced from studies focusing on the effect of non-parent adult mentors (???natural mentors???) have in positively changing the life of a resilient adolescent. Personal author experience with children, combined with the literature, provided the foundation to establish a set of suggestive guidelines that a therapist could turn to when working with adolescents and teenagers. The aim of these suggestions is focused primarily on therapists who have not worked with or have specifically avoided this demographic. This handbook can also be used by therapists who are experienced in working with adolescents and are interested in expending their skills...|$|R

In particular, there are two significant features of SER which render it computationally attractive: (<b>i)</b> it <b>can</b> effectively <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> preconditioned large-scale eigenvalue problems, and (ii) its practical implementation does not require any information about the preconditioner used: it can routinely accommodate sophisticated preconditioners designed to meet more exacting requirements (e. g. three-dimensional elasticity problems with small thickness parameters). We endow SER with theoretical convergence estimates allowing for multiple and clusters of eigenvalues and illustrate their usefulness in a numerical example for a discretized partial differential equation exhibiting clusters of eigenvalues. ...|$|R
