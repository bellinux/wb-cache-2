50|$|Hemaris is a genus of sphinx moths in the {{subfamily}} Macroglossinae, {{which is}} native to the Holarctic. Their main host plants are herbs and shrubs of the teasel and <b>honeysuckle</b> <b>families.</b> Moths in genus Hemaris are known collectively as clearwing moths or hummingbird moths in the US and bee hawk-moths in Britain.

Both genera have tails that are provided with an expansile truncated tuft of hairs, but only Hemaris has the disc of the wings transparent, as these scales are dropped soon after eclosion.|$|R

5000|$|Lonicera morrowii, the Morrow's honeysuckle, is a {{deciduous}} <b>honeysuckle</b> in the <b>family</b> Caprifoliaceae, {{native to}} Japan, Korea, and Northeast China. It is a shrub, reaching {{a height of}} 2-2.5 m, with oblong leaves 4-6 cm long.

The flowers are white to pale yellow, and the fruit is a dark red berry 7-8 mm diameter containing numerous seeds. The berries, while eaten frequently by birds, are considered poisonous to humans. It is colloquially called [...] "bush honeysuckle" [...] in the United States, and is considered an invasive species.|$|R
30|$|Symphoricarpos is a genus of the <b>honeysuckle</b> or Caprifoliaceae <b>family,</b> {{consisting}} of about 15 species of clonal deciduous shrubs in North America and 1 species endemic to China (S. sinensis) (Theis et al. [2008]). In North America, Symphoricarpos {{is one of}} the most broadly distributed shrub genera, and S. orbiculatus has been described as the dominant shrub of the tallgrass prairie (Holechek et al. [2001]; USDA Plant Database [2013]; Scasta [2014]). Asexual spread is from rhizomes and rooting of aerial stems (henceforth layering) and sexual spread is from seeds (Pelton [1953]; Hullick and Manske [2006]; Nesmith et al. [2006]). Layering occurs when vertical stems droop horizontally and produce adventitious roots when they come into contact with the soil. While the layering mechanism has been studied from a physical disturbance standpoint, it has been largely neglected in the fire ecology literature (Hartmann and Kester [1975]; Deb and Pogener [2012]). Furthermore, S. orbiculatus has been characterized as a major invader of unburned prairie but the role of fire exclusion and the application of fire with livestock grazing are not well understood for this species (Bragg and Hulbert [1974]; Stubbendieck et al. [2003]). However, because S. orbiculatus is important for a wide range of wildlife species, there are conflicting views on the necessity and desirability of reducing S. orbiculatus (Korschgen [1962]; Guthrey [1980]; Brennan [1991]; Soper et al. [1993]; Harrell et al. [2001]; Stubbendieck et al. [2003]).|$|R
