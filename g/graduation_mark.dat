40|$|The {{statistical}} {{enhancement of}} administrative data sources {{has played a}} pivotal role in the analysis of the labor market in the last decades. They permit us to obtain a clearer picture of the reality than the common surveys. In so doing, they represent a cognitive instrument capable to support the decision-making strategies adequately and timely. This PhD thesis provides two case studies in this direction. Using unique administrative datasets for Italy, we deal with two important labor market issues. In the first part, we investigate the impact of employment protection on the composition of the workforce and worker turnover. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the main existing literature about the effect of EP on labor market. In Chapter 2, using a novel matched employer-employee administrative dataset, we adopt a regression discontinuity design (RDD) that exploits the variation in employment protection provisions in Italy between firms below 15 employees and those above 15 employees. Our newly dataset allows us to better identify the size of firms and most importantly the different typologies of labor contracts. In order to justify the use of the RDD approach we conduct three different tests. First, we show that firm-size density is actually continuous around the threshold, as proposed in McCrary (2008). Second, we follow Schivardi and Torrini (2008) and assess whether firms just below and above the threshold differ in their propensity to grow. Finally, we conduct a series of balancing tests to investigate to what extent firms just above and below the threshold differ in terms of the observable characteristics. Our RDD estimates suggest that EP increases worker reallocation, suggesting that EP tends to reduce rather to increase worker security. This {{can be explained by the}} fact that firms facing more stringent EP make a greater use of workers on fixed-term contracts. Indeed, the incidence of temporary work is 2 - 2. 5 percentage points higher in larger firms. There is also evidence that EP reduces labor productivity. This effect is to an important extent due to the impact of EP on worker reallocation and the incidence of temporary work. In the second part, we investigate the effect of the final <b>graduation</b> <b>mark</b> on the graduatesâ probability to be hired by firms (Chapter 3). The analysis is based on a worker-level administrative dataset. By evaluating employment contracts on the basis of their expected duration, we estimate multilevel logit and multilevel ordered logit models to take into account the clustered structure of the data and the nature of the response variables. Using a random intercept and a random slope specifications, we find the existence of a non-trivial effect of the <b>graduation</b> <b>mark</b> on the probability to be hired, even after controlling for the problem of selection. Specifically, the effect is non-monotonic: it is positive below a certain threshold, and it becomes negative afterwards. In case of permanent contracts, the effect of the <b>graduation</b> <b>mark</b> is not significant, while the major chosen by the student plays a key role...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, the {{internal}} migration flows from Southern Italy {{to the central}} and northern {{regions of the country}} have become more significant. Unlike the past, these flows are characterised by a strong incidence of qualified workers with secondary or tertiary education. Also, even in this restricted set of workers, the most talented (the best and brightest) individuals are the ones showing the highest propensity to migrate. This paper applies a binary segmentation technique to a database of 10701 individuals graduated at Palermo and Naples universities between 2004 and 2007 in order to get groups with mostly differentiated attitudes to migrate. The evidence shows that variables driving segmentation (i. e. the most relevant variables in explaining the propensity to migrate) are the subject of study (who graduates in engineering and scientific disciplines is more mobile), the <b>graduation</b> <b>mark</b> (who gets higher marks is more likely to migrate) and the family social and cultural background.
