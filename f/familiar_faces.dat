25|$|Brokaw, Rather, and Jennings {{became the}} <b>familiar</b> <b>faces</b> of network news {{for more than}} two decades. But changes began in December 2004, when Brian Williams took over from Brokaw as anchor of NBC Nightly News, after Brokaw's well-anticipated retirement, {{announced}} in 2002. Rather also retired from the anchor seat of CBS Evening News in March 2005, albeit quite abruptly, after it was discovered that CBS used documents whose authenticity could not be verified in a report on George W. Bush's Air National Guard record. Jennings stepped away from the network anchor seat as well in April 2005, after he announced that he had lung cancer and would undergo chemotherapy. After the announcement, ABC World News Tonight was hosted by Bob Woodruff and Elizabeth Vargas.|$|E

25|$|After {{that day}} of pleasantry, Gromyko {{for the first}} time in his life wanted to enter higher education, but without warning, Gromyko and his family were moved in 1954 to Moscow, {{settling}} in the northeastern Alexeyevsky District. In 1936, after another three years of studying economics, Gromyko became a researcher and lecturer at the Soviet Academy of Sciences. His area of expertise was the US economy, and he published several books on the subject. Gromyko assumed his new job would be a permanent one, but in 1939 he was called upon by a Central Committee Commission which selected new personnel to work in diplomacy. (The Great Purge of 1938 opened many positions in the diplomatic corps.) Gromyko recognised such <b>familiar</b> <b>faces</b> as Vyacheslav Molotov and Georgy Malenkov. A couple of days later he was transferred from the Academy of Sciences to the diplomatic service.|$|E

25|$|Six {{years after}} the release of the final Republic serial, Dick Tracy headlined four feature films, {{produced}} by RKO Radio Pictures. Dick Tracy (a.k.a. Dick Tracy, Detective) (1945) was followed by Dick Tracy vs. Cueball in 1946, both with Morgan Conway as Tracy. Ralph Byrd returned for the last two features, both released in 1947: Dick Tracy's Dilemma and Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome. Gruesome is probably the best known of the four, with the villain portrayed by Boris Karloff. All four movies had many of the visual features associated with film noir: dramatic, shadowy photographic compositions, with many exterior scenes filmed at night (at the RKO Encino movie ranch). Lyle Latell co-starred in all four films as Pat Patton. Anne Jeffreys played Tess Trueheart in the first two, succeeded by Kay Christopher and finally Anne Gwynne; Ian Keith joined the cast as the actor Vitamin Flintheart for two films; Joseph Crehan played Chief Brandon. RKO stocked the films with <b>familiar</b> <b>faces,</b> creating a veritable rogues' gallery of characters: Mike Mazurki as Splitface, Dick Wessel as Cueball, Esther Howard as Filthy Flora, Jack Lambert as hook-handed villain The Claw; baldheaded, pop-eyed Milton Parsons, mild-mannered Byron Foulger, dangerous Trevor Bardette, pockmarked, gently sinister Skelton Knaggs.|$|E
500|$|On the {{connection}} between Xenogears and Xenosaga, Takahashi has stated:It's probably more suitable {{to say that it}} follows the direction and style of Xenogears.

Though there are <b>familiar</b> <b>faces</b> that serve as important characters in Xenosaga, others are more like self-parodies, so we don't really want Xenogears fans to overreact. Like movies, sometimes you have the director of the movie or friend of the leading actor appearing as cameos, so it's similar to that.|$|E

500|$|Season five {{received}} mixed reviews. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, {{the season}} has an approval rating of 52% based on 21 reviews, {{with an average}} score of 6.61/10. The site's critical consensus reads, [...] "Prison Break recaptures some of its old urgency in its return, but <b>familiar</b> <b>faces</b> and frenetic action aren't enough {{to make up for}} a plot that manages to bore while beggaring belief." [...] On Metacritic, the season has a score of 48 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating [...] "mixed or average reviews".|$|E
500|$|Regarding the {{characters}} that could {{appear in the}} season, Bell said in May 2015 that [...] "The idea of some <b>familiar</b> <b>faces</b> with some new faces is {{something to look forward}} to. I also think finding some new Marvel characters to pull into the universe would be cool. Fans seem to respond when there are characters from the Marvel comics and Marvel Cinematic Universe." [...] He later explained that the series has the opportunity to explore the Inhumans outside of the Royal Family (who are the major focus of the comics, television series and previously planned film). The season mentions the character Eden Fesi as an Inhuman, who is a mutant in the comics. The change was due to 20th Century Fox controlling the film and television rights to the majority of Marvel's X-Men and mutant characters.|$|E
500|$|Despite the film's {{generally}} mixed reception, critics praised Sawa's {{performance as}} Alex.

David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews remarked [...] "Sawa's personable turn as the hero is matched by a uniformly effective supporting cast rife with <b>familiar</b> <b>faces</b> (i.e. Seann William Scott, Brendan Fehr, Tony Todd, etc)...," [...] while Leydon of Variety pointed out that [...] "Sawa is credible as the second-sighted Alexâ€”unlike many other actors cast a teen protagonists, he actually looks like he might still be attending high schoolâ€”but the supporting players are an uneven bunch". LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle praised Sawa and Ali Larter's pairing, saying that [...] "Larter and Sawa, who becomes more scruffy and wild-eyed as the film progresses, make an appealing pair".|$|E

500|$|After getting {{involved}} with the Nazi Party, Schaub lost {{his job at the}} Munich Central Supply Office. Upon hearing the news, Hitler hired him as his personal aide-de-camp. Thereafter, Schaub looked after his confidential papers, carried money for Hitler's use and provided both secretary and security duties. A friendship developed, which was evident by Hitler later appearing as a witness at Schaub's second wedding. Junge states that Schaub considered himself to be an [...] "amazingly important, significant person" [...] to the Nazi cause. The Luftwaffe chief Hermann GÃ¶ring, who gave humorous nicknames to almost all in Hitler's inner circle, dubbed Schaub the [...] "Travel Marshal" [...] as he typically took care of Hitler's traveling arrangements and often accompanied him. As Hitler disliked change in personnel and liked to keep <b>familiar</b> <b>faces</b> around him, Schaub remained in Hitler's staff for 25 years. He later became Hitler's chief aide and adjutant in October 1940.|$|E
500|$|Kevin Aeh of Time Out Chicago {{said the}} episode [...] "had some great lines" [...] but overall it [...] "was a little {{all over the}} place and, as a whole, not super hilarious."

Television columnist Alan Sepinwall from The Star-Ledger was not impressed with Jenna's trip to Iceland, commenting that the show needs to find something new to do with the character or have her quit TGS. Sepinwall wrote that the writing staff have done [...] "better iterations" [...] of Tracy being mad at Liz story angles. The A.V.

500|$|A third {{series was}} {{announced}} on 27 September 2010, commissioned by BBC Learning, {{as part of}} a new BBC strategy to provide learning opportunities for all audiences.

[...] We'll be enlisting the help of the BBC's best talent to maximise the reach of our output," [...] and Sathe commented, [...] "We are thrilled with the success of the first two series and have already started to storyline the third. Be prepared for a few <b>familiar</b> <b>faces,</b> a couple of new ones and a lot of fireworks." [...] It was confirmed that Learning would fund the third series and work with young people to develop storylines [...] "that bring to life subjects in the Personal, Social, Health Education (PSHE) curriculum such as bullying or peer pressure." [...] A regional schools tour was organised to tie in with the launch of the series, with pupils writing short scenes based on scenarios tying in with the PSHE curriculum, which were performed, filmed and edited. Sarah Miller, BBC Learning commissioner and executive producer of series 3, explained: [...] "The schools tour was a terrific opportunity to deliver powerful face-to-face workshops, giving students and teachers the opportunity to develop key media production skills and to get behind the scenes of a top BBC drama." ...|$|E

500|$|Summed up by James Dinh of MTV News, [...] " [...] 'Party' takes viewers {{back to an}} old-school {{backyard}} celebration full {{of colorful}} bikinis, freestyle dancing and a few <b>familiar</b> <b>faces.</b> Throughout the video, [...] lets loose, playing a sort of party host. If she is not lounging in beach chairs, she is dancing among her friends or mowing the lawn." [...] The clip is centered around a trailer park hood and a subsequent soiree. It starts with a dog barking behind a fencing, followed by multiple intercut scenery, which includes two men engaged in a conversation, a woman leaning against a car, a little girl riding a bicycle and a saucepan caught in fire. Then, BeyoncÃ© appears, dressed in bright colored as well as flashy garments, sporting neon-colored oval shaped nails, and bright-colored lipstick. She is cooking in a skillet while one of her neighbors drinks from a hose. As she sings, looking into the camera, she highlights and plays with her hair. The action shifts from the double wide to a sunny summer backyard barbecue, where BeyoncÃ© and her friends dance as Solange is deejaying. This is followed by scenes of BeyoncÃ©, floating in an above ground pool while singing and entertaining her guests. She is wearing a pink one-piece swimsuit, dropping earrings and her hair looks crimped. Other girls bask {{in the sun and}} splash in the pool as Solange works the turntables.|$|E
