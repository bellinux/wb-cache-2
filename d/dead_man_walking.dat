500|$|Bowie was {{inducted}} into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 17 January 1996. Incorporating experiments in British jungle and drum 'n' bass, Earthling (1997) was a critical and commercial success in the UK and the US, and two singles from the album – Little Wonder and <b>Dead</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Walking</b> – became UK Top 40 hits. Bowie's song [...] "I'm Afraid of Americans" [...] from the Paul Verhoeven film Showgirls was re-recorded for the album, and remixed by Trent Reznor for a single release.

The reunion led to other collaborations including a limited-edition single release version of Placebo's track [...] "Without You I'm Nothing", co-produced by Visconti, with Bowie's harmonised vocal added to the original recording.|$|E
