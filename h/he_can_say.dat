500|$|The most {{important}} advice he gives aspiring songwriters {{is to write}} what you know or what you've experienced. [...] "Use reality as the springboard to whatever you're writing about", Paul said. Paul also says that being a successful songwriter is like being a journalist who writes about what he sees and knows, the times people are living in and the things people are facing today. [...] "The journalist {{looks out the window}} and writes about what is really happening." [...] "I make sure it's real. [...] I don't want to fictionalize about things I haven't witnessed." [...] Paul states that over the years he's learned the value of simplicity in writing. He's learned that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> more when he writes more simply and direct. [...] "It's almost as if you can be complex and intricate by adopting a shorter, less complicated structure." [...] "I'm not doing rocket science -- I'm a storyteller", he said. [...] "I hope to inspire people to think and feel and to walk out with more than they came in with." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Jenna, {{worn out}} from working on TGS {{during the day}} and on her {{unlicensed}} Janis Joplin biopic at night, visits Dr. Leo Spaceman (Chris Parnell) for help so she can work on both. He gives Jenna a military-grade experimental drug currently being tested on rats to stay awake. At the same time, Tracy believes that having enough money to pay FCC fines means that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> anything on television, and he says to Liz, [...] "I can even say what Ernest Borgnine whispered to me." [...] As a result, Tracy curses on The Martha Stewart Show, and after learning that the show's advertisers are pulling out, due to his actions, decides to sponsor the show. Meanwhile, Vice President of East Coast Television and Microwave Oven Programming for General Electric, Jack Donaghy, desperately tries to find a name for a pocket microwave oven that is not offensive in any language. With Liz gone, Jack assigns the TGS writing staff, Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell), J. D. Lutz (John Lutz), Josh Girard (Lonny Ross), and Sue LaRoche-Van der Hout (Sue Galloway), to this task. After their unsuccessful attempts, Kenneth suggests [...] "The Funcooker" [...] which Jack decides is the perfect name.|$|E

500|$|The Three-Eyed Raven begins {{transferring}} {{knowledge to}} Bran as {{the army of}} wights arrives. While in a vision of Winterfell, Bran hears the cries of Meera Reed {{who is trying to}} save Bran's body while the Children hold back the wights. The Three-Eyed Raven advises Bran to listen to her, and Bran splits his consciousness by both remaining in the vision of the past and simultaneously warging into Hodor in the present. The Night King enters the cave and kills the Three-Eyed Raven. As Bran, Meera and Hodor make their escape, Leaf and Bran's direwolf, Summer, sacrifice themselves to hold back the wights. Hodor closes the hideout's door behind them, keeping the wights inside while Meera escapes with Bran. Meera repeatedly orders Hodor to [...] "hold the door" [...] shut while they flee, which results in the Wights tearing him apart. In the vision, Bran becomes overwhelmed by the split consciousness and unintentionally wargs into a younger version of Hodor in the vision, then known as Wylis, forging a connection between the past and present. With Bran's consciousness inside his head, Wylis suffers a seizure while hearing the echoes of Meera's orders and he begins to yell the words [...] "hold the door" [...] over and over, until they slur together and [...] "Hodor" [...] is all that's left that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>say.</b>|$|E
500|$|Webb {{described}} {{the film as}} [...] "a story about a kid who grows up looking for his father and finds himself." [...] Both Webb and star Garfield described Parker as an outsider by choice, someone hard to get close to. As in the early comic books, the character [...] "is a science whiz. If you look {{back to the early}} Stan Lee and Steve Ditko comics, he's a nerd with big glasses," [...] said Webb. He explained [...] "the idea of what a nerd is has changed in 40 or 50 years. Nerds are running the world. Andrew Garfield made a movie [...] about it. ... What was important in those early comics was this notion that Peter Parker is an outsider and how we define that in a contemporary context." [...] Garfield compared his Spider-Man façade as a metaphor for internet anonymity, saying, [...] "You feel the power of it, the power of not being seen, the power of the mask. Peter becomes witty when he's got that protective layer. It's like he's on a message board. He's got the anonymity of the Internet within that suit, and <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> whatever the [...] @#!*% [...] he likes, and he can get away with anything." [...] Garfield tried to explore Parker as an orphan, whom he feels [...] "are the strongest human beings on the planet." [...] He said Parker is [...] "a human hero [...] goes through all of the same struggles that we all have gone through, especially the skinny ones [...] want more power than they feel they have." [...] He believes Parker represents [...] "a very inspiring, aspirational character that symbolizes goodness—and {{how difficult it is to}} be good—but how worth it it is." [...] Rhys Ifans compared this film to William Shakespeare's Hamlet on the grounds that Spider-Man can be redone over and over in different ways. He felt that they are similar in that they both represent meaningful archetypal young men grappling with the loss of their father. Critics like Claudia Puig of USA Today felt that Garfield's character as the superhero [...] "embodies the nerdy Parker, the anguished fatherless teen and the cocky super-hero in equal doses". Boyd Hoij of Variety noted that Garfield's character as Spider-Man makes an interesting hero in the film because of how it establishes early on that Peter's growing pains along with his search for an identity are common to any teenager and that [...] "his struggles involve real people—and real lives." ...|$|E
2500|$|Major Gowen, {{played by}} Ballard Berkeley, is a {{slightly}} senile, amiable old soldier {{who is a}} permanent resident of the hotel. [...] He {{is one of the}} few guests whom Basil seems to like. This is because he has the establishment status that Basil craves. He usually wears the Royal Artillery jagged-striped tie, and once mentions to Mrs. Peignoir being in France in 1918. He often is introduced as their [...] "oldest resident" [...] and in the episode [...] "Waldorf Salad" [...] Basil reveals that the Major has lived there for seven years. He enjoys talking about the world outside, especially the cricket scores and workers' strikes (the frequent strikes at British Leyland during the time of the series' original transmission were often mentioned), and is always on the lookout for the newspaper. In the episode [...] "The Germans" [...] he shows he has trouble forgiving the Germans because of the wars. The best <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> is that German women make good card players. In the same episode, he also demonstrates his outdated racial attitudes when he comments about the ethnic difference between [...] "wogs" [...] and [...] "niggers"—but in a manner innocent of malice or bigotry. Despite his good intentions, the Major can cause Basil's plans to go awry, notably in the episode [...] "Communication Problems" [...] in which Basil tries his best to keep the money he won in a bet a secret from Sybil.|$|E

Despite this, Den unveils Queenie as the true prison-snitch and gains respect, rising through the ranks to become [...] "No.1" [...] of his landing. On the outside, the Firm still feel that Den is a liability; fearing that he will tell the police about their dealings and decide that Den has to die.

He contacts Michelle, requesting that they meet by a canal where they have held secret meetings in the past, so <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> goodbye to her and Vicki. Unaware that the Firm is following her, Michelle unwittingly brings them to Den and he is shot {{by a man who}} is hiding a gun in a bunch of daffodils. A splash is heard, indicating that Den has fallen into the canal. The police search for Den's body but don't find anything until Sharon finds Den's signet ring for sale on a market stall in May 1990 and requests that the canal be searched again, unaware that Den was not wearing it when he was shot. This time, a body is found, and Sharon identifies it as Den. The body is buried that year.|$|E
