5|$|Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), {{director}} of New Directions, the McKinley High School glee club, hires Jesse St. James (Jonathan Groff)—an alumnus of championship-winning rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline—as {{a consultant to}} help them develop a strategy to win the upcoming Nationals competition. Jesse convinces Will to use Vocal Adrenaline's methodology, which is to identify the club's best performer and center the <b>entire</b> <b>performance</b> on that person, and Will decides to hold auditions to determine who will be featured. Santana Lopez (Naya Rivera), Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) and Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) all audition, with Jesse and Will as judges. Jesse is {{highly critical of the}} performances by Santana, Kurt and Mercedes, while he praises his former girlfriend Rachel's performance. He tells Will that Rachel is the clear winner, which angers the other three. Ultimately, Will decides to ignore Jesse's advice and instead plans to do for Nationals what brought them victory at the Regionals competition: having the whole group sing original songs.|$|E

25|$|The dalang, {{sometimes}} referred to as Dhalang or Kawi Dalang, is the puppeteer artist behind the <b>entire</b> <b>performance.</b> It is he who sits behind the screen, sings and narrates the dialogues of different characters of the story. With a traditional orchestra in the background to provide a resonant melody and its conventional rhythm, the dalang modulates his voice to create suspense thus heightening the drama. Invariably, the play climaxes with the triumph of good over evil. The dalang is highly respected in Indonesian culture for his knowledge, art and as a spiritual person capable of bringing to life the spiritual stories in the religious epics.|$|E
25|$|William Ball's 1976 American Conservatory Theater production, {{starring}} Fredi Olster and Marc Singer. This celebrated {{production was}} grounded {{very much in}} commedia dell'arte, with acrobats, clowns, pantomime-style violence, over-the-top posturing (Petruchio is depicted shirtless for almost the <b>entire</b> <b>performance),</b> much highly choreographed physicality {{on the part of}} the two leads, and an on-stage audience of clowns who provided on-going sound-effects, such as drums for punches and whistles for people fainting. This production dropped Sly altogether. Katherina's final speech is delivered in an ironic manner, with Olster winking at the audience, before grabbing a confused Petruchio and kissing him passionately. The production was broadcast by PBS in 1976 as part of their Great Performances series, with the TV presentation directed by Kirk Browning.|$|E
25|$|John K. Bradford is {{a retired}} {{educator}} with a background in television broadcasting.

He has also owned a diving store in Brantford and a post-production facility in Ottawa. He was president of the Broadcast Educators' Association of Canada in the early 1990s and has also served on the boards of the Brantford General Hospital and the Rotary Club of Brantford. Bradford {{is a member of the}} Liberal Party of Canada and nominated Jane Stewart for the party's nomination in Brant in the buildup to the 2000 federal election. He was elected to the Brantford City Council in 2006 on a platform that highlighted community planning principles, tackling greyfields, and finishing up the cleanup of brownfields. He was suspended without pay for ninety days in 2009, following harassment complaints by a staff member who had been involved in an interpersonal situation with a member of Bradford's family. Bradford acknowledged that he had created an inappropriate situation, accepted the punishment, and said that the matter was isolated and should not reflect on his <b>entire</b> <b>performance</b> as a councillor. He sought re-election in 2010, highlighting the need to re-develop the downtown. The target of an anonymous smear campaign, he finished fourth in the two-member ward.|$|E

Apatow filmed them performing their routines in front of live audiences, using six cameras to capture their performances and audience reactions. Apatow filmed their <b>entire</b> <b>performances,</b> although only five to ten minutes of stand-up footage appear in the film. Hill admitted his performance was not well-received because he had never done stand-up before. Additionally, Apatow filmed scenes from Sandler's character's fictional filmography, as well as scenes from Schwartzman's character's fictional television show Yo Teach!, for the film to add realism.|$|R
500|$|When hand props {{other than}} fans are used, {{they are usually}} {{introduced}} or retrieved by kuroko who fulfill a similar role to stage crew in contemporary theatre. [...] Like their Western counterparts, stage attendants for Noh traditionally dress in black, but unlike in Western theatre they may appear on stage during a scene, or may remain on stage during an <b>entire</b> <b>performance,</b> in both cases in plain view of the audience.

500|$|The Diva Dance opera {{performance}} used {{music from}} Gaetano Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor: [...] "Il dolce suono", the mad scene of Act III, Scene 2.

Part One (titled [...] "Lucia di Lammermoor") and Part Two (titled [...] "The Diva Dance") of this piece are included as separate tracks on The Fifth Element soundtrack, but are sequenced to create the effect of the <b>entire</b> <b>performance</b> seen in the film. The end of Part One blends into the beginning of Part Two, creating a smooth transition between the two tracks.|$|E
500|$|Wilson {{achieved}} a wider fame for his successful libel {{action against the}} BBC in {{what became known as}} [...] "the case of the intrusive H". In 1933, the BBC had printed in the 14 April edition of its magazine The Radio Times a letter from a retired schoolmaster who, having heard a broadcast of the St Matthew Passion, accused Wilson of the technical fault of aspirating his runs in decorated music: [...] "I am amazed that the BBC could engage anyone quite so incompetent in his breath control. … 'Pilate's wife' became 'Pigh-highlet's wigh-highf'; 'High Priest' was turned into 'High-high Pree-heest'; 'Purple robe' into 'Purple ro-hobe'; 'to' into 'too-hoo', and so on throughout the <b>entire</b> <b>performance.</b> It was simply ghastly." [...] When Wilson complained, the BBC initially offered to publish an apology in The Radio Times, but then took exception when Wilson demanded £5,000 in damages.|$|E

Jackson performed his song [...] "Man in the Mirror", before he and other singers such as Rod Stewart, Al Green, James Brown, Sean Combs and Pink closed the show with [...] "What More Can I Give." [...] Joe D'Angelo of MTV later stated that the <b>entire</b> <b>performance</b> was held together by Jackson and Billy Gilman, who he claimed {{were the only two}} who looked like they knew the lyrics to the song. He concluded that the collective rendition of the song was altogether [...] "choppy and disparate." [...] Jon Pareles also wrote negatively about the performance. He stated that it [...] "became a shambles as [...] stageful of guests missed their cues or couldn't be heard".|$|E

500|$|Filming {{began in}} San Francisco on March 13, 1923, and lasted until late June. Despite the initial {{contract}} between von Stroheim and Goldwyn, Lehr agreed {{to double the}} film's budget to $347,000 three days after shooting began. Von Stroheim had already worked twenty-hour days for over two months of pre-production and collapsed on set {{after a few days}} of filming. He remained in good health {{for the remainder of the}} shoot. This was not the only mishap on set; during scenes shot at San Francisco Bay, Cesare Gravina got double pneumonia, making von Stroheim bitterly ashamed that Gravina's <b>entire</b> <b>performance</b> was later cut from the film, despite the actor's dedication to the role. Hersholt was knocked out by Gowland during the picnic scene in which McTeague and Schouler fight, and Pitts was almost run over by a trolley. In late May, Lehr visited von Stroheim on the set and praised the footage that he had seen, saying that [...] "it has atmosphere, color and realism that could not possibly have been reproduced in the studio." ...|$|E
500|$|Isherwood {{also notes}} that this serves a female audience. [...] "If there are chick flicks and chick lit – {{derogatory}} though some might find those terms to be – Love, Loss, and What I Wore should clearly be classified as chick legit...for the women who can share deeply in the particulars of experience dissected and discussed." [...] The Los Angeles Times notes the light nature of the subject matter: [...] "...isn't out to reclaim female sexuality from centuries of oppression; it wittily celebrates wardrobe malfunctions..." [...] According to Reiner, the show points out that [...] "...if {{there is one thing}} the females of the species have in common, it's a deep and abiding love/hate relationship with their wardrobe...this wonderfully witty show illustrates, what one wears to the party is sometimes more memorable than the party itself." [...] He {{also notes that}} the <b>entire</b> <b>performance</b> has meaning as it is [...] "jam-packed and resonant" [...] throughout. Shaw notes that [...] "The cozy humor strikes many women's funny bones with a mighty whack, perhaps because it reaffirms so perfectly their own preoccupations." ...|$|E
500|$|Ashman {{first met}} American actress and singer Jodi Benson {{while he was}} {{directing}} her in Smile. After the production closed prematurely, Ashman invited Smiles entire female cast to audition for The Little Mermaid using [...] "Part of Your World", {{although he did not}} tell them the name of the project they were auditioning for. Ashman mailed a copy of his demo of [...] "Part of Your World" [...] to Benson, to which she listened in preparation for her audition. Benson then recorded a brief sample of the song on a reel-to-reel tape, which she mailed to Disney. All audition tapes were left unidentified so that the candidates would remain anonymous to Musker and Clements, delighting Ashman when the directors ultimately selected Benson's tape to be the voice of Ariel. Her first voice acting role, for which she had to be carefully trained on properly projecting into the studio microphone, Benson found the process of recording [...] "Part of Your World" [...] somewhat difficult after Ashman instructed her to approach it as though she was reciting a monologue as opposed to singing a song, although she found Ashman telling her exactly how he wanted her to perform its lyrics helpful with benefiting her <b>entire</b> <b>performance.</b> Ashman remained in the recording booth with Benson during the entire recording process, advising her on performing the song with intensity as opposed to belting it and whispering lines to her as she sang them. It was rare for a filmmaker to direct a performer from within the booth, requiring Ashman to move carefully to prevent his gestures from being recorded by the microphone. Initially struggling to capture Ariel's [...] "tomboyish-ness and yearning", Benson requested that the studio's lights be dimmed to simulate the feeling of being underwater. Menken and Ashman deliberately selected segments from Benson's recording session that [...] "are not perfectly sung" [...] to include in the final version, ranging from unsustained, incorrect notes lacking in vibrato to spoken words, because the songwriters wanted her performance to sound as [...] "real" [...] as possible.|$|E
40|$|Music {{performance}} has being studied since {{long time and}} several computational systems were developed for generating expressive music performances.
