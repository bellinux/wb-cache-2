40|$|This {{research}} practically discusses {{and presents}} {{the stages of}} design process in product development. Design process was realized through CATIA. The product developed is an agricultural device called as “disc harrow”. Therefore, agricultural details are presented together with machine design. A <b>roller</b> <b>system</b> is added to disc harrow in this study. Thus; the current system and the additional <b>roller</b> <b>system</b> are discussed {{with the principles of}} methodological construction and design objectives are defined. Both the current system and the additional <b>roller</b> <b>system</b> are designed in parallel with these objectives. Structural stress analysis is performed at different kinetic positions of the disc harrow connection of the <b>roller</b> <b>system.</b> System design is achieved by considering the feedback from such analyses and design objectives. The hereby design is obtained. The additional <b>roller</b> <b>system</b> is mounted and field survey is carried out. Contribution of the roller to disc harrow process, defined design objectives, ratio of the realization of design objectives and results of stress analyses are evaluated...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} study the hot Compact Strip Production (CSP), four-high mill {{vibration}} characteristics, and vibration suppression method, the <b>roller</b> <b>system</b> structure stability was analyzed and calculated at first in the paper. And then, the mill stand gap was measured at field and its influence on roll transverse vibration was analyzed. The drum gear coupling effect on the <b>roller</b> <b>system</b> stability and the automatic balance conditions of the coupling transmission torque were studied; the influence of axial force caused by the roller cross on the system stability was analyzed. Finally, the roller transverse friction chatter vibration mechanics model was established; the simulation analysis was carried out with eliminating mill house-bearing clearance and adding floating support for coupling, respectively. And {{the characteristics of the}} roller “jump vibration” were studied. We applied copper gaskets to eliminate or reduce mill house-bearing clearance for suppressing the rolling mill vibration on the spot; the test results show that the roller transverse vibration was suppressed after eliminating clearance...|$|R
40|$|We are {{studying}} a hydraulic system design and vehicle dynamic modeling for a development of tire <b>roller</b> <b>system,</b> {{because those are}} very important in analysis of tire roller. Generally, tire roller {{is one of the}} useful machines in a road construction field and it technically applied for many other construction fields. Also, we conceptualize of new hydraulic and traction system, and define about to the motion equations for dynamic and hydraulic analysis. First, we design the hydraulic circuit of steering control and traction machine system, which can apply to advance performance of the lateral control and create prototype of construction equipment. Second, we formulate hydraulic steering and traction models through this study combined to the tire <b>roller</b> <b>system</b> development technology.

50|$|Ring {{spinning}} is {{a method}} of spinning fibres, such as cotton, flax or wool, to make a yarn. The ring frame developed from the throstle frame, which in its turn was a descendant of Arkwright's water frame. Ring spinning is a continuous process, unlike mule spinning which uses an intermittent action. In ring spinning, the roving is first attenuated by using <b>drawing</b> <b>rollers,</b> then spun and wound around a rotating spindle which in its turn is contained within an independently rotating ring flyer. Traditionally ring frames could only {{be used for the}} coarser counts, but they could be attended by semi-skilled labour.|$|R
50|$|Samuel Crompton's Spinning Mule, {{introduced}} in 1779, {{was a combination}} of the spinning jenny and the water frame in which the spindles were placed on a carriage, which went through an operational sequence during which the rollers stopped while the carriage moved away from the <b>drawing</b> <b>roller</b> to finish <b>drawing</b> out the fibres as the spindles started rotating. Crompton's mule was able to produce finer thread than hand spinning and at a lower cost. Mule spun thread was of suitable strength to be used as warp, and finally allowed Britain to produce highly competitive cloth in large quantities.|$|R

40|$|The {{software}} package DEFORM {{is used to}} construct a finite-element model to describe the <b>roller</b> <b>drawing</b> of tubes on a long mandrel.

50|$|A mill {{was built}} on West Hemlock Creek {{for the purpose of}} {{producing}} boards and timber. It was the first mill for this purpose in Hemlock Township. However, Barton had built a mill on the northern bank of Hemlock Creek 0.5 mi from its mouth, shortly after arriving in the area. The mill was torn down and rebuilt by Isiah Barton in 1842. It was also renamed the Red Mill at this time. In 1885, Isiah McKelvy bought the mill and added a <b>roller</b> <b>system.</b> The mill was still operating as late as the 1910s.|$|R

A high level of fiber damage caused by the opening rollers occurs at high speeds. The level of damage differs from one sort of material to another.

5000|$|In 2006, Charles C. Cornelius and Shawn P. Lawlor {{received}} a patent for a cage-less recirculating <b>roller</b> screw <b>system.</b> [...] As {{with the traditional}} recirculating <b>roller</b> screw <b>system,</b> <b>rollers</b> disengage from the screw when they come upon an axial groove in {{the wall of the}} nut. The system differs in that the rollers are continually engaged by the nut, and the axial groove of the nut is threaded. Non-helical threads in the axial groove of the nut return the roller to its axial starting position (after completion of an orbit). Non-circular compression rings, or cam rings, at opposite ends of the rollers (roller axles) apply constant pressure between rollers and nut, synchronizing roller rotation and thrusting the rollers into the nut's axial groove. Lacking ring gears and roller cage, cage-less recirculating roller screws can be relatively efficient and, as a result, permit higher dynamic capacities for some screw shaft diameters.|$|R
