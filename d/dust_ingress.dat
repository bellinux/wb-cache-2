50|$|RFID Tags : By far {{the most}} common type of ID token as it is the most {{reliable}} in the sometimes harsh environment where fuelling takes place. Using an RFID tag means there are no openings required in the Fuel Management Terminal and hence best protection from water or <b>dust</b> <b>ingress.</b> RFID tags are low cost and very reliable and the reader requires no ongoing maintenance.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the {{predecessor}} of the Israel Defense Forces, Haganah, developed a close {{copy of the}} Johnson LMG, the Dror, in both [...]303 British and 7.92×57mm Mauser. Israeli forces found the Dror prone to jam from sand and <b>dust</b> <b>ingress,</b> and the weapon was discontinued after {{a brief period of}} service. Ernesto [...] "Che" [...] Guevara notably used a Johnson in the Cuban Revolution.|$|E
30|$|It {{has been}} argued that the {{establishment}} of a healthy and productive vegetation cover can ameliorate most of the detrimental effects of stockpiled coal discard on the environment, including the human component. Cladding of discard dumps with perennial vegetation is assumed to bind and stabilize the substrate thereby reducing <b>dust,</b> reducing the <b>ingress</b> of oxygen and percolation of water to minimize erosion and, both acidic leachate formation and sediment loss (Truter et al. 2009). To this end, discard dumps and opencast spoil are conventionally treated with high levels of lime to negate any acid generating potential of the substrate, covered in a layer of topsoil (usually 50 – 100  cm), and re-vegetated using selected annual and perennial species. This approach brings with it specific problems that include acidification of the cover soil due to capillary rise of acid leachate formed gradually from the underlying discard. As a consequence, re-vegetation is often sporadic, substrate compaction ensues, and the cover vegetation eventually dies. This, coupled with the approach of sourcing and acquiring topsoil from remote locations, results in a rehabilitation strategy that is far from sustainable and outcomes that are less than desirable Cowan et al. (2016).|$|R
40|$|Fission {{products}} {{deposited in}} the coolant circuit outside of the active core play a dominant role in source term estimations for advanced small pebble bed HTRs, particularly in design basis accidents (DBA). The deposited fission products may be released in depressurization accidents because present pebble bed HTR concepts abstain from a gas tight containment. Contamination of the circuit also hinders maintenance work. Experiments, performed from 1972 to 88 on the AVR, an experimental pebble bed HTR, allow for a deeper insight into fission product transport behavior. The activity deposition per coolant pass was lower than expected and was influenced by fission product chemistry and by presence of carbonaceous dust. The latter lead also to inconsistencies between Cs plate out experiments in laboratory and in AVR. The deposition behavior of Ag was in line with present models. Dust as activity carrier is of safety relevance because of its mobility and of its sorption capability for fission products. All metal surfaces in pebble bed reactors were covered by a carbonaceous dust layer. Dust in AVR was produced by abrasion in amounts of about 5 [*]kg/y. Additional dust sources in AVR were ours oil ingress and peeling of fuel element surfaces due to an air <b>ingress.</b> <b>Dust</b> has a size of about 1 [*]m, consists mainly of graphite, is partly remobilized by flow perturbations, and deposits with time constants of 1 to 2 [*]hours. In future reactors, an efficient filtering via a gas tight containment is required because accidents with fast depressurizations induce dust mobilization. Enhanced core temperatures in normal operation as in AVR and broken fuel pebbles have to be considered, as inflammable dust concentrations in the gas phase...|$|R
5000|$|The Israeli FAL {{first saw}} action in {{relatively}} small quantities during the Suez Crisis of 1956, the Six-Day War in June 1967, the War of Attrition of 1967 until 1970, {{it was the}} standard Israeli rifle. During the Yom Kippur War of October 1973 {{it was still in}} front-line service as the standard Israeli rifle, though increasing criticism eventually led to the phasing-out of the weapon. Israeli forces were primarily mechanized in nature; the long, heavy FAL slowed deployment drills, and proved exceedingly difficult to maneuver within the confines of a vehicle. [...] Additionally, Israeli forces experienced repeated jamming of the FAL due to heavy sand and <b>dust</b> <b>ingress</b> endemic to Middle Eastern desert warfare, requiring repeated field-stripping and cleaning of the rifle, sometimes while under fire. During the later stages of the Yom Kippur War, it was noted that some Israeli soldiers had informally exchanged their FALs for the far more reliable Soviet Kalashnikov AK-47 assault rifles taken from dead and captured Arab soldiers. Though the IDF evaluated a few modified FAL rifles with 'sand clearance' slots in the bolt carrier and receiver (which were already part of the Commonwealth L1A1/C1A1 design), malfunction rates did not significantly improve. It {{should be noted that the}} sand cuts for the Israeli FAL models were inferior to the effective Commonwealth L1A1 sand cuts. [...] The Israeli FAL was eventually replaced by the M16 and the Galil (a weapon using the Soviet Kalashnikov operating system, and chambered in either 5.56×45 or 7.62 NATO), though the FAL remained in production in Israel until the 1980s.|$|E
