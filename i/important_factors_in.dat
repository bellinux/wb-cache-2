5|$|As {{a magnet}} school founded to promote school integration, racial and {{economic}} diversity have been <b>important</b> <b>factors</b> <b>in</b> admissions decisions. The student body was 52.1percent black, 41.7percent low income, and 7.7percent disabled in 2009–10. In 2007, {{in response to}} a US Supreme Court decision prohibiting racial criteria for assigning students to public schools, CPS eliminated race and gender as determining factors in magnet school admissions. School officials insist this will have little impact, despite parent concerns that the decision will erode diversity.|$|E
5|$|Media {{coverage}} of the movement has focused on popular leaders, such as Hensley, and the deaths of ministers by snakebite have received particular attention. Practitioners of snake handling continue to view Hensley as a great man. Kimbrough recorded a discussion with an advocate of snake handling who dismissed Hensley's personal failings as slanderous fabrications. His advocacy, leadership, and– in particular– his personal charisma were <b>important</b> <b>factors</b> <b>in</b> the advancement of the movement.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{atmospheric}} circulation bands consist {{of the trade}} winds in the equatorial region below 30° latitude and the westerlies in the mid-latitudes between 30° and 60°.

5|$|Although {{cyclones}} take {{an enormous}} toll in lives and personal property, {{they may be}} <b>important</b> <b>factors</b> <b>in</b> the precipitation regimes of places they affect and bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions. Hurricanes in the eastern north Pacific often supply moisture to the Southwestern United States and parts of Mexico. Japan receives over half of its rainfall from typhoons. Hurricane Camille averted drought conditions and ended water deficits along much of its path, though it also killed 259people and caused $9.14billion (2005 USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|Matsueda {{is noted}} for her jazzy style, which she often {{incorporated}} into the soundtracks she worked on; she also touched on genres like jazz fusion, lounge, and ambient. For the scores that she collaborated on with Eguchi, she was {{responsible for most of}} the jazzy tracks, while Eguchi provided the majority of the electronic music. Matsueda has said that the best qualities of a composer are their curiosity and sensitivity, and that watching many things, listening, touching, and feeling are <b>important</b> <b>factors</b> <b>in</b> composition. When asked why she creates music, Matsueda replied that she feels it is an appropriate way to express herself.|$|E

5|$|Tropical cyclones, {{a source}} of very heavy rainfall, consist of large air masses several hundred miles across with low {{pressure}} at the centre and with winds blowing inward towards the centre in either a clockwise direction (southern hemisphere) or counter clockwise (northern hemisphere). Although cyclones can take an enormous toll in lives and personal property, they may be <b>important</b> <b>factors</b> <b>in</b> the precipitation regimes of places they impact, as they may bring much-needed precipitation to otherwise dry regions. Areas in their path can receive a year's worth of rainfall from a tropical cyclone passage.|$|E
5|$|Mitochondria divide by binary fission, {{similar to}} {{bacterial}} cell division. The regulation of this division differs between eukaryotes. In many single-celled eukaryotes, their growth and division {{is linked to}} the cell cycle. For example, a single mitochondrion may divide synchronously with the nucleus. This division and segregation process must be tightly controlled so that each daughter cell receives at least one mitochondrion. In other eukaryotes (in mammals for example), mitochondria may replicate their DNA and divide mainly in response to the energy needs of the cell, rather than in phase with the cell cycle. When the energy needs of a cell are high, mitochondria grow and divide. When the energy use is low, mitochondria are destroyed or become inactive. In such examples, and in contrast to the situation in many single celled eukaryotes, mitochondria are apparently randomly distributed to the daughter cells during the division of the cytoplasm. Understanding of mitochondrial dynamics, which is described as the balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission, has revealed that functional and structural alterations in mitochondrial morphology are <b>important</b> <b>factors</b> <b>in</b> pathologies associated with several disease conditions.|$|E
5|$|The Homosexual Matrix {{is a book}} by American {{psychologist}} Clarence Arthur Tripp, {{in which}} the author discusses the biological and sociological implications of homosexuality, and also attempts to explain heterosexuality and bisexuality. The book {{was first published in}} 1975 by McGraw-Hill Book Company, and later republished in a revised edition in 1987. Based on his review of the evidence, Tripp argues that people do not become homosexual due to factors such as hormone levels, fear of the opposite sex, or the influence of dominant and close-binding mothers, that the amount of attention fathers give to their sons has no effect on the development of homosexuality, that psychoanalytic theories of the development of homosexuality are untenable and based on false assumptions, and that sexual orientation is not innate and depends on learning. Tripp considers early puberty and early masturbation <b>important</b> <b>factors</b> <b>in</b> the development of male homosexuality, and maintains that a majority of people are heterosexual because their socialization has made them want to be heterosexual. He also argues in favor of social tolerance of homosexuality and non-conformist behavior in general.|$|E
