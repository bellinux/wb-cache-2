5|$|William Friese-Greene <b>experimented</b> <b>with</b> {{celluloid}} {{and motion}} pictures {{in his studio}} in the 1870s, developing {{some of the earliest}} movie camera technology. He is credited as being one of the inventors of cinematography.|$|E
5|$|Barlow also <b>experimented</b> <b>with</b> sound recording.

5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 20th century, a number of inventors <b>experimented</b> <b>with</b> high-mass collectors.

5|$|Chrisye {{chose his}} own costumes {{and at times}} <b>experimented</b> <b>with</b> {{different}} colours and designs.

5|$|Continuing to seek ways to oust Castro {{following}} the Bay of Pigs Invasion, Kennedy {{and his administration}} <b>experimented</b> <b>with</b> various ways of covertly facilitating {{the overthrow of the}} Cuban government. Significant hopes were pinned on a covert program named the Cuban Project, devised under the Kennedy administration in 1961.|$|E
5|$|During {{post-production}} Welles {{and special}} effects artist Linwood G. Dunn <b>experimented</b> <b>with</b> an optical printer to improve certain scenes that Welles found unsatisfactory from the footage. Whereas Welles was often immediately pleased with Wise's work, he would require Dunn and post-production audio engineer James G. Stewart to re-do their work several times {{until he was}} satisfied.|$|E
50|$|Other <b>experiments</b> <b>with</b> alum production, making {{bread from}} potatoes, and paint {{manufacturing}} also proved unprofitable. His <b>experiments</b> <b>with</b> producing soda from table salt proved more successful {{but were not}} enough to reverse his financial misfortunes.|$|R

5|$|Glassmakers {{throughout}} history have <b>experimented</b> <b>with</b> glass fibers, but mass {{manufacture of glass}} fiber was only made possible with the invention of finer machine tooling. In 1893, Edward Drummond Libbey exhibited a dress at the World's Columbian Exposition incorporating glass fibers with the diameter and texture of silk fibers. Glass fibers can also occur naturally, as Pele's hair.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, the Polaroid Corporation {{gave him}} one of their new SX-70 cameras, which he <b>experimented</b> <b>with</b> into the 1980s.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, Noel Lee wanted {{to improve the}} sound quality from his home audio equipment. He didn't have very much money, so Lee <b>experimented</b> <b>with</b> ways to create a better sound by {{improving}} inexpensive cabling. At first he worked out of his family's apartment and later in his in-laws' garage, which they rented from family after moving to the Richmond district in 1978. Lee <b>experimented</b> <b>with</b> different widths, winding methods, and qualities of copper and insulation in audio cables to find {{an alternative to the}} zip cord audio vendors gave out for free. He compared different wire constructs, while listening to Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture.|$|E
5|$|Larwood and Voce practised {{the plan}} over the {{remainder}} of the 1932 season with varying but increasing success and several injuries to batsmen.

5|$|Like Bülow, Bache {{performed}} {{works from}} memory instead of from the printed page, {{at a time}} when doing so was a matter of open debate. Also like Bülow, he began giving recitals devoted entirely to the work of one composer. In 1879, he began giving all-Liszt recitals, and in 1883 he <b>experimented</b> <b>with</b> an all-Beethoven recital.|$|E
5|$|Like the two {{contemporary}} architects Bramante and Antonio da Sangallo the Elder, Leonardo <b>experimented</b> <b>with</b> {{designs for}} centrally planned churches, {{a number of}} which appear in his journals, as both plans and views, although none was ever realised.|$|E
