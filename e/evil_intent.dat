5|$|The role {{of intent}} {{is one of}} the most {{important}} and definitive elements of the karma theory, in all its traditions. In Jainism, intent is important but not an essential precondition of sin or wrong conduct. <b>Evil</b> <b>intent</b> forms only one of the modes of committing sin. Any action committed, knowingly or unknowingly, has karmic repercussions. In certain philosophies, like Buddhism, a person is guilty of violence only if he had an intention to commit violence. On the other hand, according to Jains, if an act produces violence, then the person is guilty of it, whether or not he had an intention to commit it.|$|E
25|$|During {{training}}, conscripts woke {{up between}} 5-6 am and training lasted for 10-12 {{six days of}} the week. Much of the training was done by rote and consisted of instruction. Before 1941 training had lasted for six months, but after the war, training was shorted to a few weeks. After finishing training, all men {{had to take the}} Oath of the Red Army which read: I______, a citizen of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics, entering into the ranks of the Red Army of the Workers and Peasants', take this oath and solemnly promise to be a honest, brave, disciplined, vigilant fighter, staunchly to protect military and state secrets, and unquestioningly to obey all military regulations and orders of commanders and superiors.I promise conscientiously to study military affairs, in every way to protect state secrets and state property, and to my last breath to be faithful to the people, the Soviet Motherland, and the Workers-Peasants' Government.I am always prepared on order of the Workers and Peasants Government to rise to the defense of my Motherland, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; and as a fighting man of the Red Army of Workers and Peasants', I promise to defend it bravely, skillfully, with dignity and honor, sparing neither my blood nor my life itself for the achievement of total victory over our enemies.If by <b>evil</b> <b>intent</b> I should violate this, my solemn oath, then let the severe punishment of Soviet law and the total hatred and contempt of the working classes befall me. Tactics were based on the 1936 training manual and the revised edition of 1942. Small unit movements and how to build defensive positions were laid out in a manner that was easy to understand and memorize. The manuals had the force of law and violations of the manuals were legal offenses. Soviet tactics always had the platoons attacking in the same way with the platoons usually broke into four sections occupying about 100 yards on average. The only complex formation was the diamond formation with one section advancing, two behind and one in the rear. Unlike the Wehrmacht, the Red Army did not engage in leap-frogging of sections with one section providing fire support to the sections that were advancing, and instead all of the sections and platoons attacked en masse. The other only variation was for the sections to “seep” into a position by infiltration.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{sociology}} of the Bhagavata Purana, writes Edwin Bryant, those with malicious and <b>evil</b> <b>intent</b> are first destroyed, but even they are involuntarily liberated because they constantly think of Krishna and devote their life to destroying him.

In several chapters, the text states that the Bhagavata is a means for women to seek spiritual liberation, with some verses suggesting that expressing their sensual desires is one path to such devotion.|$|E

2500|$|When Orthodox Christians {{refer to}} Fallen Nature {{they are not}} saying that human nature has become evil in itself. Human nature is still formed {{in the image of}} God; we are still God's creation, and God has never created {{anything}} evil. But our fallen nature remains open to <b>evil</b> <b>intents</b> and actions. It is sometimes said that we are [...] "inclined to sin"; that is, we find some sinful things attractive. It is the nature of temptation to make sinful things seem the more attractive, and it is the fallen nature of humans that seeks or succumbs to the attraction. Orthodox Christians reject the Augustinian position that the descendants of Adam and Eve are actually guilty of the original sin of their ancestors. But just as any species begets its own kind, so fallen humans beget fallen humans, and from the beginning of our existence we lie open to sinning by our own choice.|$|R

The blessed John the Baptist came before Him [...] "in the spirit and power of Elias."
