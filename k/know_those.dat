500|$|Renewal was {{uncertain}} {{until after the}} finale aired. In April, actor Enrico Colantoni, who plays Keith, stated regarding renewal, Unofficially, everyone at CBS and Warner Bros is saying, [...] "Yeah, no worries!" [...] But you <b>know,</b> <b>those</b> are always famous last words. And then last year they told us two days after we wrapped, and they {{got a lot of}} criticism over that. So I know they're not gonna make that mistake again. They're gonna wait until May. Colantoni also expressed optimism towards the show's future on The CW, believing {{that it would be a}} chance for the show to get more exposure. On May 15, before the official press release was announced, it was believed that The CW had ordered 13 episodes of Veronica Mars. Later, it was revealed that the series had been renewed for a 22-episode season, but that the season could be shortened if ratings were poor.|$|E

The Jordanaires sang harmony, {{as they had}} on The Steve Allen Show; they would work with Presley through the 1960s. A few days later, the singer made an outdoor concert appearance in Memphis at which he announced, [...] "You <b>know,</b> <b>those</b> people in New York are not gonna change me none.

[...] He concluded that the episode is [...] "a definite swing for the fences, and I think it hits its mark completely." [...] The scenes at the video game convention were praised by Anthony Severino of Game Revolution as well. He commented that the writers [...] "nailed it. Everything from the massive displays, long lines, and even the look of the Los Angeles Convention Center was spot on.

500|$|Before {{beginning}} work, {{the development}} team commissioned {{two pieces of}} music that they felt would inspire the right emotional tone for the game to guide their efforts. They created a number of prototypes, including concepts focused on growing flowers and based around human consciousness. The team decided that a prototype centered on petals floating in the wind best captured the emotions they wanted to evoke. They made keeping the player in a peaceful emotional state their design focus, and removed elements that frustrated players such as petal collection requirements to unlock levels and game mechanics that were too traditional and made the players too excited. The team tried to not place any barriers in the levels, allowing the player to go anywhere in an open world, but realized that without a few guidelines, such as the camera focusing on new flowers or segmenting the levels, players became confused and frustrated. Chen described the process as [...] "almost like we wanted to throw away the traditional game design, but we end up picking up all the pieces we threw away and putting them back because we <b>know</b> <b>those</b> are actually needed to deliver a good guided experience". The overall development time was two years, but the team spent three quarters of {{that time in the}} prototyping stage. After deciding on the game elements, Flower was produced in only six months.|$|E

2500|$|Richard Franklin Lennox Thomas Pryor (December 1, 1940– December 10, 2005) was an American {{stand-up}} comedian, actor, {{and social}} critic. Pryor {{was known for}} uncompromising examinations of racism and topical contemporary issues, which employed colorful vulgarities and profanity, as well as racial epithets. He reached a broad audience with his trenchant observations and storytelling style. He {{is widely regarded as}} one of the most important and influential stand-up comedians of all time: Jerry Seinfeld called Pryor [...] "The Picasso of our profession" [...] and Bob Newhart heralded Pryor as [...] "the seminal comedian of the last 50 years". Dave Chappelle said of Pryor, [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>those,</b> like, evolution charts of man? He was the dude walking upright. Richard was the highest evolution of comedy." [...] This legacy can be attributed, in part, to the unusual degree of intimacy Pryor brought to bear on his comedy.

When asked by BBC's Daily Politics presenter Andrew Neil in a December 2015 interview to name the [...] "swathes" [...] of Britain that are no-go areas for non-Muslims, Hopkins replied that she couldn't for [...] "legal reasons".

2500|$|Kant {{named his}} brand of {{epistemology}} [...] "Transcendental Idealism", and he first laid out these views {{in his famous}} work The Critique of Pure Reason. In it he argued that there were fundamental problems with both rationalist and empiricist dogma. To the rationalists he argued, broadly, that pure reason is flawed when it goes beyond its limits and claims to <b>know</b> <b>those</b> things that are necessarily {{beyond the realm of}} all possible experience: the existence of God, free will, and the immortality of the human soul. Kant referred to these objects as [...] "The Thing in Itself" [...] and goes on to argue that their status as objects beyond all possible experience by definition means we cannot know them. To the empiricist he argued that while it is correct that experience is fundamentally necessary for human knowledge, reason is necessary for processing that experience into coherent thought. He therefore concludes that both reason and experience are necessary for human knowledge. In the same way, Kant also argued that it was wrong to regard thought as mere analysis. [...] "In Kant's views, a priori concepts do exist, but if they are to lead to the amplification of knowledge, they must be brought into relation with empirical data".|$|E
2500|$|Reiss {{has contributed}} to {{numerous}} film screenplays. He wrote several jokes for the film Ice Age after The Simpsons colleague David Silverman asked him and Jon Vitti to help out with the film's story issues. He later wrote a number of screenplays including [...] and Horton Hears a Who!. The first live-action film he wrote was 2009's My Life in Ruins, starring Nia Vardalos. Reiss initially wrote the film, {{which was based on}} his experience on holiday bus tours of Mexico and Greece, as a short story. After it was rejected by 37 publishers he rewrote it as a screenplay and sent it to Vardalos who [...] "snatched it right up". The film garnered a negative critical response with Roger Ebert, for example, stating [...] "there is, in short, nothing I liked about My Life in Ruins, except some of the ruins" [...] and calling Reiss' script [...] "lousy". Reiss defended the film: [...] "My Life in Ruins really makes people happy. It's a relentlessly sweet movie about the basic decency of humanity. It's happy ending kicks in around the 30-minute mark and continues for the next hour. I <b>know</b> <b>those</b> [...] were sitting there in that audience.

2500|$|Evans played Shakespeare's Cleopatra for {{the last}} time in 1946–47, in her late fifties. Her {{performance}} divided the critics: opinions varied from [...] "an agonising disaster" [...] to [...] "a joy to watch". Kenneth Tynan said, [...] "Lady Bracknell has been involved in a low Alexandrian scandal". Evans had never been classically good looking, but she was a great enough actress to [...] "convey beauty without being conventionally beautiful". What troubled many, including Agate and Gielgud, about her Cleopatra and other tragic heroines was not her appearance but a sense that tragedy came less naturally to her than comedy. Some of the great Shakespearian tragic roles she constantly refused to play, notably Lady Macbeth. She told Gielgud, [...] "I could never impersonate a woman who had such a peculiar notion of hospitality", which he took to mean that she could not contemplate the character's [...] "explicit admission of evil". Evans once remarked, [...] "I don't think there is anything extraordinary about me except this passion for the truth", a passion revered by Gielgud and others, but one that prevented her from attempting a character whose essence she could not understand. She said to Shaw that she had been asked to play Volumnia in Coriolanus, but [...] "isn't she a bloodthirsty old harridan? I could never play her." [...] This did not mean that she had to like the characters she played, but she had to understand them. When she first read through the role of Lady Bracknell with Gielgud she commented, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>those</b> sort of women. They ring the bell and tell you to put a lump of coal on the fire." ...|$|E
