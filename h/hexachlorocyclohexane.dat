25|$|Lindane, {{also known}} as gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane, (γ-HCCH), gammaxene, Gammallin and {{sometimes}} incorrectly called benzene hexachloride (BHC), is an organochlorine chemical variant of <b>hexachlorocyclohexane</b> {{that has been used}} both as an agricultural insecticide and as a pharmaceutical treatment for lice and scabies.|$|E
25|$|Versteeg et al. also {{concluded}} that, {{contrary to}} Lerchers analysis, the transcription levels of many genes in RIDGEs (for example a cluster on chromosome 9) can vary strongly between different tissues. Lee et al. (2003) analyzed {{the trend of}} gene clustering between different species. They compared Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Homo sapiens, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana and Drosophila melanogaster, and found a degree of clustering, as fraction of genes in loose clusters, of respectively (37%), (50%), (74%), (52%) and (68%). They concluded that pathways of which the genes are clusters across many species are rare. They found seven universally clustered pathways: glycolysis, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, ATP synthase, DNA polymerase, <b>hexachlorocyclohexane</b> degradation, cyanoamino acid metabolism, and photosynthesis (ATP synthesis in non plant species). Not surprisingly these are basic cellular pathways.|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} and agricultural use of lindane {{are the primary}} causes of environmental contamination, and levels of lindane in the environment have been decreasing in the U.S., consistent with decreasing agricultural usage patterns. The production of lindane generates large amounts of waste <b>hexachlorocyclohexane</b> isomers, and [...] "every ton of lindane manufactured produces about 9 tons of toxic waste." [...] Modern manufacturing standards for lindane involve the treatment and conversion of waste isomers to less toxic molecules, {{a process known as}} [...] "cracking".|$|E

40|$|Atmospheric {{concentrations}} of α- and γ-hexachlorocyclohexanes were measured {{once a week}} in Dalian throughout 2008, using a high-volume air sampler, to estimate diurnal, monthly and seasonal variations. Multiple regression {{analysis was used to}} estimate the impact of selected meteorological conditions on atmospheric {{concentrations of}} <b>hexachlorocyclohexanes</b> and to identify the potential source regions. Overall, α- and γ-hexachlorocyclohexanes were mainly associated with the gas phase, with an annual mean gas-phase concentration of 36 ± 30 and 10 ± 9. 8 pgm- 3 respectively. On the other hand, mean particle (PM 10) associated concentrations throughout the year were 1. 9 ± 2. 4 and 0. 46 ± 0. 43 pgm- 3 respectively. Gas-phase concentration of α- and γ-hexachlorocyclohexanes peaked in the autumn season whereas highest concentrations in the particle phase were measured in spring. Ratio of α-/γ-isomer ranged from 3. 7 to 7. 4 in the gas phase which was close to the ratio in technical <b>hexachlorocyclohexanes</b> (5 - 7). In the particle-associated phase this ratio ranged from 1. 2 to 3. 8, with the exception of daytime samples in spring (up to 16) and summer seasons (up to 14) and this exception could be due to the isomerization from γ- to α- in ambient air, at least partly resulted from the impact of sunlight. Regression analysis showed that, at the sampling site, concentrations of α- and γ-hexachlorocyclohexanes in the gas phase were both elevated with increasing temperature and wind speed, whereas in the particle-associated phase their concentrations tended to remain stable...|$|R
2500|$|Lindane is the gamma isomer of <b>hexachlorocyclohexane</b> ("γ-HCH"). In {{addition}} {{to the issue of}} lindane pollution, some concerns are related to the other isomers of HCH, namely alpha-HCH and beta-HCH, which are notably more toxic than lindane, lack its insecticidal properties, and are byproducts of lindane production. In the 1940s and 1950s, lindane producers stockpiled these isomers in open heaps, which led to ground and water contamination. The International HCH and Pesticide Forum has since been established to bring together experts to address the clean-up and containment of these sites. Modern manufacturing standards for lindane involve the treatment and conversion of waste isomers to less toxic industrial chemicals, a process known as [...] "cracking". Today, only a few production plants remain active worldwide to accommodate public-health uses of lindane and declining agricultural needs. Lindane has not been manufactured in the U.S. since the mid-1970s, but continues to be imported.|$|E
2500|$|Based {{primarily}} on evidence from animal studies, most evaluations of lindane {{have concluded that}} it may possibly cause cancer. In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer [...] classified lindane as a known human carcinogen, and in 2001 the EPA concluded there was [...] "suggestive evidence of carcinogenicity, but not sufficient to assess human carcinogenic potential." [...] The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services determined that all isomers of <b>hexachlorocyclohexane,</b> including lindane, [...] "may reasonably be anticipated to cause cancer in humans," [...] and in 1999, the EPA characterized the evidence carcinogenicity for lindane as [...] "suggestive ... of carcinogenicity, but not sufficient to assess human carcinogenic potential." [...] Lindane and its isomers have also been on California's Proposition 65 list of known carcinogens since 1989. In contrast, the World Health Organization concluded in 2004 that [...] "lindane {{is not likely to}} pose a carcinogenic risk to humans."

40|$|Organochlorine {{pesticides}} (OCPs) were, for {{the first}} time, quantified in archived firn cores from East Antarctica representative of 1945 – 1957 and 1958 – 1967 (current era, C. E.). The core sections were melted under high-purity nitrogen atmosphere, and the meltwater was analysed. Methods allowed quantification of <b>hexachlorocyclohexanes,</b> heptachlor, trans-chlordane, dieldrin and endrin. While the core presented evidence of nominal contamination by modern-use chemicals, indicating handling and/or storage contamination, legacy OCP concentrations and deposition rates reported are orders of magnitude lower than those from Arctic regions, lending support for their validity. The study further provides a description of equipment used and suggests methods to overcome logistical challenges associated with trace organic contaminant detection in polar regions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Persistent organic pollutants, suchas {{organochlorine}} insecticides and {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} (PCBs), were measured in several environmental matrices including aerial deposition, seawater, sediment, and biota in two important coastal wetlands of Hong Kong, China.

40|$|Concentrations of {{organochlorine}} pesticides (OCPs; dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), <b>hexachlorocyclohexanes</b> (HCHs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB)) were investigated in 105 soil samples collected in {{vicinity of the}} chemical industrial parks in Tianjin, China. OCP concentrations significantly varied in the study area, high HCH and DDT levels were found close to the chemical industrial parks. The intensity of agricultural activity and distance from the potential OCP emitters have important influences on the OCP residue distributions. Principal component analysis indicates that HCH pollution {{is a mix of}} historical technical HCH and current lindane pollution and DDT pollution input is only due to technical DDT sources. The significant correlations of OCP compounds reveal that HCHs, DDTs and HCB could have some similar sources of origin...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{key feature}} of POPs (Persistent Organic Pollu-tants) is their {{potential}} for long-range atmospheric transport. In order to better understand and predict atmospheric source-receptor relationships of POPs, we have modified an existing Lagrangian transport model (FLEXPART) to include {{some of the key}} processes that control the atmospheric fate of POPs. We also present four years (2004 – 2007) of new atmospheric measurement data for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and <b>hexachlorocyclohexanes</b> (HCHs) obtained at Birkenes, an EMEP (European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme) site in southern Norway.

The concentrations of POPs in muscle samples in finless porpoise were 2 to 10 times higher than those in fin whale. This might {{be the result of}} differences in prey resources. Percentage composition of chlordanes (CHLs), <b>hexachlorocyclohexanes</b> (HCHs), and DDTs were determined in muscle samples.

40|$|A {{large-scale}} test of combined hydraulic/microbial in situ sanitation of {{the first}} aquifer has been conducted on an industrial site contaminated by chlorobenzenes, chlorophenols, <b>hexachlorocyclohexanes</b> and BTX aromatics. Part of the contaminated ground water was treated in an above-ground water treatment plant, in which 99 % degradation of the pollutants was achieved. After addition of nutrients and oxygen, the treated water was recycled into the aquifer. As a result, the pollutant concentration decreases to 0. 1 mg BOD/l. The luminous bacteria test revealed the absence of toxicological effects. Remaining isolated subground centers of trichlorobenzene still caused a permanent recontamination of the aquifer.
