5|$|In {{the next}} scene Harris and Klebold are {{standing}} outside their high school. The player guides {{them to the}} cafeteria to plant their timed propane bombs without being detected by security cameras or hall monitors. After the explosives are set, the two stop <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> a hill outside the school, discussing their alienation and hostility. After the bombs fail to explode as planned, Harris and Klebold decide to enter the school and murder {{as many people as}} they can; the final number killed is up to the player. After roaming around the school shooting innocents, Harris and Klebold commit suicide. A montage of clips showing Harris and Klebold's corpses, students comforting each other, and childhood photos of the gunmen plays.|$|E
500|$|The {{head of the}} {{household}} takes a jug of wine and pours some on the badnjak; in some regions, he may strew wheat grains over the logs. He then proposes a toast: [...] "Grant, O God, that there be health and joy in this home, that our grain and grapevines yield well, that children be born healthy to us, that our property increase in the field, pen, and barn!" [...] or, [...] "Hail, badnjak, veseljak! I give you wheat and wine, and you give me every good thing and peace!" [...] or similar. The name veseljak, literally [...] "jovial one", is used along with badnjak in some areas. The head drinks a draught of wine from the jug, after which it is passed to other members of household. In the clan of Kuči, wine is poured on the [...] "beard" [...] of the badnjak, and then a little girl sits <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> the log—for the well-being of the cattle. Christmas Eve dinner follows, which traditionally includes a round loaf of unleavened bread, beans, fish, walnuts, honey, and red wine. The bread is not cut with a knife, but broken with hands.|$|E
500|$|Three days later, it was {{reported}} that Marvel was looking at Alan Taylor and Daniel Minahan as prospective directors to replace Jenkins, and were also in the midst of hiring a writer to rewrite Don Payne's script, with the shortlist of possible writers consisting of John Collee, Robert Rodat, and Roger Avary. At the end of the month, Alan Taylor, best known for directing episodes of the HBO fantasy series Game of Thrones, was chosen to direct the sequel. Feige mentioned Taylor's work on the series Mad Men, Boardwalk Empire and Game of Thrones as reasons for his hiring, saying [...] "With Alan's direction we got a few more layers of patina, of texture, of reality into our golden realm." [...] By January 10, Marvel Studios had commissioned screenwriter Robert Rodat to rewrite the sequel and Hiddleston stated that filming was expected to begin in London in the summer of 2012. Hemsworth later confirmed that filming was scheduled to begin in August. Hemsworth also revealed that the film would have a more Viking-influenced feel, elaborating [...] "I think the science fiction element to Thor… the danger is it falls a little bit into the world of it's 'tough to throw a light to.' I think of big waterfalls and mountains and a Viking influence, where the Norse mythology kind of grew from. Having that in Asgard {{is going to make it}} all the more special and that's what Alan [...] wants to bring to it." [...] Feige said [...] "while the relationship between Loki and Thor certainly has changed [...] and has progressed, a lot of Thor 2 is picking up where it left off in terms of Jane, who you just saw <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> a computer monitor, and also what's been going on in the nine realms without the Asgardians being able to use the Bifrost." [...] Feige also said that while Loki has a part, [...] "there will be a different villain, another big villain".|$|E
60|$|The smile which <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> dwelt <b>on</b> {{his lips}} was not unkind.|$|R
60|$|Dick {{glanced at}} Torpenhow, whose left eyelid lay <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> dead <b>on</b> his cheek.|$|R
60|$|Dominey nodded, {{and seemed}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> intent <b>on</b> {{watching}} {{the flight of}} a pigeon which kept tantalisingly out of range.|$|R
2500|$|Though often oppressive, Crabbe's poetry had {{remarkable}} popular appeal, which Hazlitt {{attempts to}} explain by isolating two causes: the reading public was tiring of the formal, conventional, empty phrasing of most {{poetry of the}} day; and simultaneously there had been developing a public taste for painting. Something in Crabbe's The Village had caught {{the interest of the}} respected critic Dr. Johnson, but it was a painter, the famous Sir Joshua Reynolds, who in 1783 had brought it to his attention. The time was ripe for this kind of verse: Crabbe essentially paints in words, and his word paintings embody the attention to detail typical of Dutch and Flemish painters of the 17th century, a sharp and welcome relief from the vapid, conventional phraseology of much Augustan poetry. [...] "Painting is essentially an imitative art; it cannot subsist <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> empty generalities ... Mr. Crabbe ... paints in words, instead of colours." ...|$|E
60|$|Duveen nodded, and {{his glance}} rested <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> Lister's forehead.|$|E
60|$|He {{sat down}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> the stone steps and {{analysed}} himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hallo! strangers," [...] cried one, as they halted <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>on</b> observing us. [...] "Queer {{place to}} camp. Fond o' water and dirt, I guess?" ...|$|R
60|$|Aquilar {{took out}} a cross from under his doublet, {{and held it out}} towards Roger, who, after looking at it <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> fell <b>on</b> his knees and kissed it.|$|R
60|$|Spike, who {{had been}} {{standing}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>on</b> his right leg, and seemed at last to {{have come to a}} decision, hastily changed to the left, and grinned feebly.|$|R
60|$|A {{peculiar}} smile played <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> the haggard {{features of}} the thief.|$|E
60|$|Adam Wayne {{laid his}} hand <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> the sword, then dropped it.|$|E
60|$|A shade rested <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> her companion's fair face. She shrugged her shoulders.|$|E
6000|$|He stopped; she bounded to him, and {{throwing}} {{her arms around}} his neck with a light laugh, let herself hang <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> breathless <b>on</b> his breast. Then recovering her speech she said slowly:-- ...|$|R
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> Madeline sat <b>on</b> {{her horse}} with shut eyes. She dreaded the light.|$|R
60|$|Colonel Osborne, when he {{was left}} alone, stood <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>on</b> the spot, {{and then with a}} whistle, a shake of the head, and a little low chuckle of laughter, rejoined the crowd.|$|R
60|$|He {{touched her}} left hand very lightly, lingered <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> her fourth finger.|$|E
60|$|Then Bethune {{came down}} and let his hand rest <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> Jimmy’s shoulder.|$|E
60|$|They {{reached the}} door, opening it softly. She lingered <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> the threshold.|$|E
60|$|While Dick stood {{watching}} them, they had gained, unopposed, the first {{fringe of the}} leafless forest, and, turning a little from their direction, the sun fell <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> full <b>on</b> their array, as it was relieved against the dusky wood.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] Pamela {{answered}} quickly, [...] "I am Mr. Lutchester's guest this evening. If you {{are still}} here, I shall love to come and speak to aunt <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> later <b>on.</b> If not, I will ring up to-morrow morning." ...|$|R
60|$|Her mind dwelt <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>on</b> {{the picture}} of herself losing her youth and ceasing to enjoy--not minding whether she did this or that: but such picturing inevitably brought back {{the image of her}} mother.|$|R
60|$|His eyes dwelt <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> a large can {{within reach}} of an outstretched arm.|$|E
60|$|Lute leaned to {{the side}} and rested her hand <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> Dolly's wet neck.|$|E
60|$|A {{peculiar}} smile lingered <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> Julius's face. He {{threw the}} letter into the waste-paper basket.|$|E
6000|$|Esmond's eyes rested <b>for</b> just <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> Sewell. [...] "Only two {{or three}} of the men talking rather wildly, sir. Somebody has been putting notions into their heads. It {{occurred}} to me I might as well make sure they all had certificates." ...|$|R
60|$|Mistress Lambert's {{attitude}} {{had also}} changed at sight of Editha, who stood <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> undecided <b>on</b> the threshold ere she ventured within. The look of obstinacy died {{out of the}} wrinkled face; the eyes took on a strange expression of sullen wrath.|$|R
60|$|But Leopold Hirsch had {{remained}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> standing <b>on</b> {{the doorstep of}} Ignácz Goldstein's house. He watched horse and rider through that cloud of dust, and along the straight and broad highway, until both had become a mere speck upon the low-lying horizon.|$|R
60|$|He stood <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> the pavement. Then {{he glanced}} at his watch and hailed a cab.|$|E
60|$|The lawyer, who {{had been}} {{standing}} silent all this time, drew the Duke <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> <b>on</b> one side.|$|E

60|$|Her {{flashing}} eyes, uplifted <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> lighted again <b>on</b> Carker, and {{she held}} some letters out in her left hand.|$|R
60|$|When she had {{finished}} this business, Miss Panney stood <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>moments</b> <b>on</b> the broad piazza of the hotel, which was deserted, for almost everybody was on the beach. In spite of her agitation a grim smile came over her face.|$|R
6000|$|Bashville, after <b>a</b> <b>moment's</b> hesitation, seized Cashel, who {{immediately}} became grave and attentive, and remained imperturbably so while Nashville expertly threw him.
