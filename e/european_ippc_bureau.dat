40|$|The EC {{directive}} on integrated {{pollution prevention}} and control (IPPC-directive) addresses {{all aspects of}} environmental protection including emissions into the atmosphere, liquid discharges, waste related issues, efficient use of energy and resources and safety aspects. It aims at achieving a high level protection for the environment as a whole. In order to support the exchange of information on best available techniques (BAT) {{in the frame of}} this directive the German Environmental Protection Agency (Umweltbundesamt) initiated a comprehensive survey of operational experience from large combustion plants in Germany. Based on this survey this report presents techniques used in these installations to combust solid, liquid and gaseous fuels including the operational experience of in total 31 installations. This selection includes both new and retrofitted power plants. The presentation of individual installations includes 18 examples of coal-fired plants, 2 biomass-fired plants, 4 installations for liquid and 8 examples for gaseous fuels. In addition to this, examples for the co-combustion of waste or secondary fuels are given. All examples as well as the presentation of criteria for the selection of BAT were communicated to the <b>European</b> <b>IPPC</b> <b>Bureau</b> In Seville. Many of these examples have already been integrated into the current draft of the BAT reference document. (orig.)
