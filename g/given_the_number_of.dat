5|$|<b>Given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> {{navigation}} algorithms calculating {{simultaneously to}} provide all the information in real time, {{research has been conducted}} to improve the computation time of some numerical methods using field-programmable gate arrays. The research focused on visual perception. The first part was focused on the simultaneous localization and mapping with an extended Kalman filter that estimates the state of a dynamic system from a series of noisy or incomplete measures. The second focused on the location and the detection of obstacles.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Governor Ryan {{placed a}} {{moratorium}} on executions in Illinois after courts exonerated and freed 13 death row inmates who had been wrongfully convicted. Ryan also promised to review the cases of all Illinois death row inmates. <b>Given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> cases of alleged brutality to be investigated, inmates {{who claimed to have}} been abused and gave coerced confessions were offered reduced sentences in exchange for dropping charges. A plea agreement was reached with one convicted victim. Illinois State's Attorney Devine made a broader offer to several inmates. Aaron Patterson rejected the plea deal.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Warelwast's {{background}} or family before 1087. Later in life {{he was involved in}} founding Augustinian houses of canons, which– according to historian – implies that he was an Augustinian canon or spent some of his early years in a house of such canons. Several medieval chroniclers hostile to Warelwast, including Eadmer, claim that he was illiterate, but his career suggests otherwise, as it involved the extensive use of written documents. He must also have been an accomplished speaker, <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> times he was used as a diplomat. He was possibly educated at Laon, where later in life he sent his nephew, Robert Warelwast, to school. Another nephew, William, became the bishop's steward.|$|E

For the authors of the accompanying essays, Hibbs had numerous options <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> regular contributors to The Post.|$|E
5|$|For {{technical}} advice, {{the journalists}} engaged Lieutenant Colonel George Styles GC, a retired British Army {{officer who was}} regarded as an expert in explosives and ballistics. Styles believed {{that it would have}} been obvious to the authorities that Savage's car was unlikely to contain a bomb as the weight would have been obvious on the vehicle's springs; he also expressed his opinion that a remote detonator could not have reached the car park from the scenes of the shootings <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> buildings and other obstacles between the locations. As the government refused to comment on the shootings until the inquest, the documentary concluded by putting its evidence to a leading human rights lawyer, who expressed his belief that a judicial inquiry was necessary to establish the facts surrounding the shootings.|$|E
5|$|In 1883 Gaudí was put {{in charge}} of the {{recently}} initiated project to build a Barcelona church called Basílica i Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Família (Basilica and Expiatory Church of the Holy Family, or Sagrada Família). Gaudí completely changed the initial design and imbued it with his own distinctive style. From 1915 until his death he devoted himself entirely to this project. <b>Given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> commissions he began receiving, he had to rely on his team to work on multiple projects simultaneously. His team consisted of professionals from all fields of construction. Several of the architects who worked under him became prominent in the field later on, such as Josep Maria Jujol, Joan Rubió, Cèsar Martinell, Francesc Folguera and Josep Francesc Ràfols. In 1885, Gaudí moved to rural Sant Feliu de Codines to escape the cholera epidemic that was ravaging Barcelona. He lived in Francesc Ullar's house, for whom he designed a dinner table as a sign of his gratitude.|$|E
25|$|Another, easier {{equation}} {{that can}} be applied to get the correct molecular formula of the CFC/R/Freon class compounds is this to take <b>the</b> <b>numbering</b> and add 90 to it. The resulting value will <b>give</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> carbons as <b>the</b> first numeral, <b>the</b> second numeral <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen atoms, and <b>the</b> third numeral <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> fluorine atoms. <b>The</b> rest of the unaccounted carbon bonds are occupied by chlorine atoms. The value of this equation is always a three figure number. An easy example is that of CFC-12, which gives: 90+12=102 -> 1 carbon, 0 hydrogens, 2 fluorine atoms, and hence 2 chlorine atoms resulting in CCl2F2. The main advantage of this method of deducing the molecular composition in comparison with the method described in the paragraph above is that it <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> carbon atoms of the molecule.|$|R
25|$|The contact graph of an {{arbitrary}} finite packing of unit balls is the graph whose vertices {{correspond to the}} packing elements and whose two vertices are connected by an edge if the corresponding two packing elements touch each other. The cardinality of the edge set of <b>the</b> contact graph <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> touching pairs, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> 3-cycles in <b>the</b> contact graph <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> touching triplets, and <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> tetrahedrons in <b>the</b> contact graph <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> touching quadruples (in general for a contact graph associated with a sphere packing in n dimensions that the cardinality of the set of n-simplices in <b>the</b> contact graph <b>gives</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> touching (n+1)-tuples in the sphere packing). In the case of 3-dimensional Euclidean space, non-trivial upper bounds on <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> touching pairs, triplets, and quadruples were proved by Karoly Bezdek and Samuel Reid at the University of Calgary.|$|R

5|$|In 2005, KKR was one {{of seven}} private equity firms {{involved}} in the buyout of SunGard in a transaction valued at $11.3 billion. KKR's partners in the acquisition were Silver Lake Partners, Bain Capital, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Blackstone Group, Providence Equity Partners, and TPG Capital. This represented the largest leveraged buyout completed since the takeover of RJR Nabisco in 1988. SunGard was the largest buyout of a technology company until the Blackstone-led buyout of Freescale Semiconductor. The SunGard transaction was notable <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> firms involved in the transaction, the largest club deal completed to that point. The involvement of seven firms in the consortium was criticized by investors in private equity who considered cross-holdings among firms to be generally unattractive.|$|E
5|$|The {{cemetery}} {{has been}} in use for many years but, <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> people buried in such a small area, the bodies are no longer decomposing properly. They have begun to overflow and fall into the neighbouring houses as greater excavations take place and basement walls are weakened. The entire area is also permeated with a foul smell, turning fresh produce rotten in far shorter times than natural and tainting the breath of those who live there. Baratte finds that he has both friends and enemies in the area – the cemetery is both loved and hated {{by the people of}} the district. He finds resistance from all sides, notably Ziguette who strikes Baratte during his sleep in opposition to his work. He befriends the church's flamboyant organist named Armand, recruits his old colleague Lecoeur to assist with the excavation, is monitored by the infamous Guillotin and falls in love with Heloïse, widely known in the area as a whore.|$|E
5|$|As {{planning}} for a potential military operation to release the captive soldiers progressed, it became clear that, <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> West Side Boys and their separation between two locations (Gberi Bana {{as well as the}} village of Magbeni; see below), the operation could not be conducted by special forces alone. Thus, the headquarters of 1st Battalion The Parachute Regiment (1 PARA) was ordered to assemble an enhanced company group, which would support special forces if such an operation was launched. The battalion's commanding officer selected A Company, led by Major Matthew Lowe, which had been on exercise in Jamaica {{at the time of the}} initial British deployment to Sierra Leone. Several members of A Company were new recruits who had only completed basic training two weeks prior. Lowe decided that replacing them with more experienced soldiers would risk undermining the cohesion and morale of the company, but several specialist units from elsewhere in 1 PARA were attached to A Company to bring the company group up to the required strength, including a signals group, snipers, heavy machine gun sections, and a mortar section. The additional firepower was included to maximise the options available to the planners, given that the West Side Boys had a numerical advantage and that additional resources would not be immediately available should the operation run into difficulties.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of the Minster fire, the Corporation of York (the body {{responsible}} for local government) was already engaged in a debate {{about the future of the}} city's defensive walls. The walls no longer served any practical purpose and were expensive to maintain, and with the population of the city rising rapidly the city was becoming cramped and dangerous. The city gates ("Bars") had become a public health hazard <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> locals using them as toilets, and theft of stone for other building works had left parts of the walls dangerously unstable. The Bars restricted stagecoaches, meaning York was unable to capitalise on its strategic position halfway along the lucrative London–Edinburgh route. Faced with the need to clear the city's slums, in 1800 the Corporation sought permission from Parliament to demolish the Bars and much of the walls. Owing to opposition from York Minster the scheme was abandoned, but by 1826 the barbicans of four of the gates had been demolished. In the face of this a public campaign to save the walls was launched in 1824, but attention on both sides of the debate was diverted by the Minster fire. In 1828 Etty had written to his mother expressing horror at the demolition proposals, but distracted by the need to complete Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs was unable to take any action himself. By 1831 the Corporation had decided to demolish the barbicans but to retain and restore the walls.|$|E

Despite having just designed a manege in Monaco and a dining hall for the Archduchess of Modena, 35-year-old Quarenghi seems to have felt himself underemployed, <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> architects then working in Italy and the dearth of commissions from the church and nobility.

25|$|Arguably, had Stilwell been <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> American regular {{infantry}} divisions he had continually requested, the American {{experience in}} China and Burma {{would have been}} very different.

Simon Bolivar Buckner, Jr. as commander of Tenth U.S. Army at Okinawa after the latter's death. During the last year of the war, however, the U.S. was strained to meet all its military obligations, and cargo aircraft diverted to supply Stilwell, the 14th Air Force, and the Chinese in the East left air-drop-dependent campaigns in the West, such as Operation Market Garden, woefully short of aircraft.|$|E
25|$|An issue {{likely to}} come into play will be a {{provision}} in the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-134), which places a US$200 million cap on the aggregate of all passengers' damage claims in a railroad accident against a passenger railroad, including punitive damages. Bloomberg News reported that this event would likely be the first legal test of this law, according to a former House rail committee staffer who helped write the law, who predicted that <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> casualties, the cap is almost certainly going to be an issue in pending litigation. An attorney representing two of the victims agreed, saying payouts could range from $5 million to $10 million per death or serious injury.
