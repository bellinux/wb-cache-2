40|$|Over {{the past}} �fteen years, {{the theory of}} choice under {{uncertainty}} has undergone radical change. The pivotal contribution was Machina�s (1982) demonstration that a large class of preferences could be locally approximated by expected-utility functionals and that global preferences inherited properties, such as risk aversion, of the local utility functions. Less progress has been made, however, in developing tools relating to non-local properties of preferences such as the absolute and relative risk premiums used in expected-utility theory. During this same period, however, the literature on choice under certainty made substantial progress in developing new techniques for characterizing preferences and technologies using the concepts of <b>distance</b> (<b>Färe,</b> 1988) and bene�t functions (Luenberger, 1992). In particular, Luenberger (1992, 1994) introduced the bene�t function and demonstrated its usefulness in characterizing preferences and Paretoefficient outcomes. It is natural, therefore, to ask whether these techniques can be informatively applied to problems of choice under uncertainty.

40|$|The bus {{transport}} {{industry in}} Sri Lanka {{has an important}} role to play as public transport. It’s performance affects the economic activity in various ways. Therefore an efficient public transport system is considered a highly required condition for faster economic growth and social progress in the country. However, the public transport sector in Sri Lanka especially the bus transport suffers many deficiencies {{due to the lack of}} effective and consistent policy to guide the sector. Basically bus fare is one of the most important factors regarding profit maximization in the industry as well as providing a quality service to the passengers. If not people are not interested to invest their money and they don’t stay in the industry for long. Therefore it needed a policy regarding bus fare which comes to affect a policy for the fare revisions since 2002. This policy has guided the industry to make fare revisions in scientific way. Anyhow there is a question arises that the rate which decided to revise the bus fare earlier and after introducing the policy is comparatively reasonable with other economic indicators. On the other hand it is important to examine that the rate which decided to revise the fare is reasonably applied to the individual fare stages which consist different segment of distance. Generally the accepted idea is that the short <b>distance</b> <b>fare</b> was overpriced and long distance services were under priced. This situation badly affected to the industry where the quality of the services are not improved comparatively with the increase of bus fare. Before nationalization bus fare was revised few times and available data of that are insufficient to analyze. Therefore this study mainly focused to analyze the existing fare structure which comes from nationalization of the bus transport. The bus fare was revised 25 times since 1958 under the different institutional structure and the analysis further useful to identify the period which mostly affected the collapse the uniformity of the fare structure. Basically qualities of the services depend on its price level. However the fare level in bus transport also needs to examine how fare structure affects the quality of the services. It is evident that the passenger’s views and level of satisfaction on bus transport to be identified by a survey. This study also emphasizes to recognize certain improvements to the existing fare structure which possible to achieve a better service from the bus industry...|$|E

40|$|Kabul is {{the heart}} of political, commercial, cultural, {{educational}} and social life in Afghanistan and the fifth fastest growing city in the world. Minimum income inclined most of Kabul residents to use public transport, especially buses, although there is no proper bus system, beside that there is no proper fare exist in Kabul city Due to wars. From 1992 to 2001 during civil wars, Kabul suffered damage and destruction of its transportation facilities including pavements, sidewalks, traffic circles, drainage systems, traffic signs and signals, trolleybuses and almost all of the public transport system (e. g. Millie bus). This research is mainly focused on Kabul city's transportation system. In this research, the data used have been gathered by Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in 2008 and this data will be used to find demand and fare structure, additionally a survey was done in 2016 to find satisfaction level of Kabul residents for fare structure. Aim of this research is to observe the demand for Large Buses, compare to the actual supply from the government, analyze the current fare structure and compare it with the proposed <b>fare</b> (<b>distance</b> based <b>fare)</b> structure which has already been analyzed.

In this paper a bi-level model is developed to optimize the route structure, frequency setting and fare structure simultaneously. The upper level problem is to maximize the operator’s profit while the lower level problem is an approach-based SUEED transit assignment model. An artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm is proposed to solve determine the route structure and a sensitivity analysis-based algorithm is proposed to find out the optimal frequency and fare settings. Numerical examples with discussions will be presented to investigate the behavior of the model and to examine the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
