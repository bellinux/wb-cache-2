50|$|<b>Holding</b> <b>corporations</b> {{accountable}} for either direct conduct or complicity {{for human rights}} violations has become an increasing area of attention in promoting human rights. Multinational corporations in particular have been singled out as important figures, for better or worse, in the maintenance of human rights given their economic status and international dimension. As it currently stands there is no mechanism {{at the international level}} which can hold corporations legally accountable. Reliance has instead been placed upon a number of soft law instruments the most important one of which is the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. With the potential exception for redress under the Alien Tort Statute corporations are only legally {{accountable for}} human rights violations under the municipal law of the Nation in which the violation is alleged to have occurred or the company is based.|$|E
5000|$|A wave of {{failures}} and consolidations in the 1990s {{has led to}} many cruise lines to be bought by much larger holding companies and to operate as [...] "brands" [...] within larger <b>holding</b> <b>corporations,</b> much as a large automobile company holding several makes of cars. Brands exist partly because of repeat customer loyalty, and also to offer different levels of quality and service. For instance, Carnival Corporation & plc owns both Carnival Cruise Line, whose former image were vessels that {{had a reputation as}} [...] "party ships" [...] for younger travelers, but have become large, modern, yet still profitable, and Holland America Line, whose ships cultivate an image of classic elegance. In 2004, Carnival Corporation had merged Cunard's headquarters with that of Princess Cruises in Santa Clarita, California so that administrative, financial and technology services could be combined, ending Cunard's history where it had operated as a standalone company (subsidiary) regardless of parent ownership.However, Cunard did regain some independence in 2009 when its headquarters were moved to Carnival House in Southampton.|$|E

40|$|This {{legal note}} {{analyzes}} {{the legal issues}} raised when suing corporations in the United States federal courts under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS). Part I discusses the elements needed to bring a claim under ATS and the history behind the statute. Part II describes the U. S. Supreme Court’s 2013 decision in Kiobel and what it represents. This section also covers why <b>holding</b> <b>corporations</b> accountable is important, focusing on globalization, the corporation’s power, and their role; and discusses the importance of seeking remedies for human rights victims. Part III examines whether ATS is still viable for suing corporations for human rights abuses after Kiobel and the possible alternatives available for <b>holding</b> <b>corporations</b> accountable including: regional human rights courts, naming and shaming, or suing in domestic courts where the violations occur...|$|E
40|$|After {{financial}} reform during 1990 s, the performance comparison between members vs. non-member banks of financial <b>holding</b> <b>corporations</b> {{has become a}} hot issue in Taiwan. This study uses Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to measure {{the efficiency of the}} sample banks and uses CAMELS ratings standards to test their performance for the period from 2003 to 2005. Empirical results are as follows: First, the DEA analysis indicates that the operation performances of member banks of financial <b>holding</b> <b>corporations</b> are more efficient than that of non-member banks. In general, the efficiency of all banks in Taiwan becomes better for the period from 2003 to 2005. Second, the member banks of financial <b>holding</b> <b>corporations</b> outperformed than those of the non-member by CAMELS rating standards. Non-members banks' performance has greater variation than that of the member banks of financial <b>holding</b> <b>corporations.</b> Finally, this study also used regression model to evaluate relevant performance drivers which affect DEA efficiency in banking industries. The result showed that variables of CAMELS rating standards can explain bank's DEA efficiency. Among these relevant drivers, non-performing loan (NPL) ratio has a negative effect on efficiency and loan-deposit ratio, pre-tax ROA and liquidity reserves ratio have positive effects on the operational efficiency. 我國自金融改革後，金融控股公司之成立是否能替旗下銀行帶來實質效益便一直是熱門的討論議題。過去文獻使用各種計量模型作為分析工具，以探討銀行投入資源與產出效益間是否具效率。此外，亦有部分文獻使用財務指標評估銀行之績效。本研究同時使用資料包絡分析法(Data Envelopment Analysis, DEA) 評估本國銀行效率，並以CAMELS評等法衡量營運穩健程度。研究結果發現，在 2003 至 2005 期間，金控子銀行在經營效率上平均而言優於獨立銀行，且全體銀行營運效率逐年增加，顯示在此三年中，我國銀行業應在進步中。而在CAMELS評等中，金控子銀行平均亦優於獨立銀行，其中又以 2004 年差異最大，此應與我國這段期間景氣循環有關。此外，獨立銀行標準差高於金控子銀行，顯示部分獨立銀行的表現應優於金控子銀行。最後，本研究以資料包絡分析法所求得各家銀行效率質為應變數，CAMELS評等法中各財務指標為自變數求出一迴歸式，結果顯示，CAMELS評等法各指標對銀行效率具良好的解釋能力，其中逾期放款比率與營運效率呈負向變動；存放比率、稅前資產報酬率與流動準備比率與效率則為正向關係。目錄 第一章 緒論…………………………………………………………… 1 第一節 研究背景與動機……………………………………………… 1 第二節 研究目的與問題……………………………………………… 2 第二章 文獻回顧……………………………………………………… 3 第一節 效率分析模型簡介…………………………………………… 3 第二節 資料包絡分析法……………………………………………… 3 第三節 CAMELS 評等法 ……………………………………………… 6 第四節 金融業績效評估文獻回顧…………………………………… 9 第三章 研究方法與資料說明………………………………………… 12 第一節 研究期間與樣本……………………………………………… 12 第二節 變數定義說明………………………………………………… 13 第三節 研究方法與實証假說………………………………………… 15 第四章 實證結果與分析……………………………………………… 16 第一節 資料包絡分析法實證結果…………………………………… 16 第二節 CAMELS 評等法實證結果 …………………………………… 19 第三節 銀行效率與CAMELS評等之迴歸分析………………………… 32 第五章 結論與建議…………………………………………………… 34 第一節 研究結論……………………………………………………… 34 第二節 後續研究建議………………………………………………… 35 參考文獻………………………………………………………………… 36 圖表目錄 【表 1 】 各年度選取樣本銀行說明 ………………………………… 12 【表 2 】 資料包絡分析法變數說明 ………………………………… 14 【表 3 】 CAMELS評等法變數說明 …………………………………… 14 【表 4 】 迴歸式各解釋變數預期變動方向 ………………………… 15 【表 5 】 樣本銀行投入與產出之敘述統計資料 …………………… 16 【表 6 】 樣本銀行各年度效率值 …………………………………… 17 【表 7 】 樣本銀行各年度平均效率值與平均檢定 ………………… 19 【表 8 】 2003 年樣本銀行CAMELS評等表 …………………………… 22 【表 9 】 2004 年樣本銀行CAMELS評等表 …………………………… 24 【表 10 】 2005 年樣本銀行CAMELS評等表 …………………………… 26 【表 11 】 2003 年金控子銀行與獨立銀行敘述性統計 ……………… 28 【表 12 】 2004 年金控子銀行與獨立銀行敘述性統計 ……………… 28 【表 13 】 2005 年金控子銀行與獨立銀行敘述性統計 ……………… 29 【表 14 】 金控子銀行與獨立銀行平均數檢定 ……………………… 31 【表 15 】 DEA效率值與CAMELS評等之迴歸分析……………………… 32 【圖 1 】 各年度群組銀行效率值…………………………………… 1...|$|E

40|$|There are no {{specific}} historical precedents for <b>holding</b> <b>corporations</b> responsible {{for violations of}} international law and human rights. This brief report, however, outlines some historical precedents which demonstrate that corporations and other business enterprises may be regarded as subjects of international law as opposed to objects. For that reason, it concludes that there are no grounds in international law for any corporation, including Private Military and Security Contractors (PMSCs), to avoid accountability for international law contraventions, in particular violations of human rights and, where applicable, international humanitarian law. Nevertheless, international law has not yet developed to a stage whereby PMSCs can be held responsible for internationally wrongful acts...|$|E
