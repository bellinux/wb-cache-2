30|$|The {{proposed}} {{model of}} <b>leadership</b> <b>for</b> learning seems to hold promise <b>for</b> conceptualizing <b>leadership</b> <b>for</b> {{learning in the}} context of VPE. However, further studies will need to elucidate how each element of <b>leadership</b> <b>for</b> learning might best be enacted to optimize student learning in VPE departments. Such studies will need to consider the organizational and cultural context of the VPE department. Institutes for VPE may invest in leadership development programmes that allow chairs to develop <b>leadership</b> <b>for</b> learning practices. Institutes might also focus on enacting <b>leadership</b> <b>for</b> learning at the faculty and institute level.|$|R

30|$|Hypothesis 4 {{states that}} followers’ power {{distance}} orientation is {{positively related to}} their preference <b>for</b> moral <b>leadership.</b> Because the data <b>for</b> moral <b>leadership</b> preference is skewed to the left {{with most of the}} respondents showing a high preference <b>for</b> moral <b>leadership,</b> an MLR estimator is used which is robust to data non-normality. We find that the opposite of our hypothesis is supported. Power distance orientation is negatively related to followers’ preference <b>for</b> moral <b>leadership</b> (β[*]=[*]−[*] 0.22, p[*]<[*]. 01). Hence, Hypothesis 4 is rejected.|$|R

30|$|In {{relation}} to transformational leadership, no significant relationship is found between power distance orientation and preference <b>for</b> transformational <b>leadership</b> (β[*]=[*]−[*] 0.09, n.s.). As {{to the relationship}} between followers’ CSE and their preferences <b>for</b> four <b>leadership</b> styles, except that followers’ CSE has no significant relationship with their preference <b>for</b> moral <b>leadership</b> (β[*]=[*] 0.08, n.s.), positive relationships are found between followers’ CSE and their preference <b>for</b> authoritarian <b>leadership</b> (β[*]=[*] 0.14, p[*]<[*] 0.01), benevolent leadership (β[*]=[*] 0.23, p[*]<[*] 0. 01) and transformational leadership (β[*]=[*] 0.28, p[*]<[*] 0.01).

5|$|After the {{founding}} of the Law Department in 1870, Healy and his successors hoped to bind the professional schools into a university, and focus on higher education. The School of Medicine added a dental school in 1901 and the undergraduate School of Nursing in 1903. Georgetown Preparatory School relocated from campus in 1919 and fully separated from the university in 1927. The School of Foreign Service (SFS) was founded in 1919 by Edmund A. Walsh, to prepare students <b>for</b> <b>leadership</b> in diplomacy and foreign commerce. The School of Dentistry became independent of the School of Medicine in 1956.

Responding to widespread interest, Dr. Tripp gave a talk in 1963 at the Fifty-third Annual Meeting of the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America on Development of Leadership in Boy Leaders of Boys. In August 1963, a patrol of Scouts from the San Mateo County Council and a few boys from the Circle Ten Council in Dallas attended White Stag summer camp at Camp Pico Blanco. The program was observed and evaluated by Ken Wells (national director of Research) and John Larson (staff researcher). Wells had a long history with Wood Badge, beginning as a participant in the second United States Wood Badge course in 1948. They were impressed by the program.|$|E
5|$|During {{the time}} when African Americans were barred from ordination, women began to receive greater {{opportunities}} <b>for</b> <b>leadership.</b> Women formed {{an important part of}} the Assemblies of God's constituency, many being Sunday School workers and evangelists, most prominent being Aimee Semple McPherson (who would later found the Foursquare Church). This made the issue of women's place in the movement important in the 1930s. It was also recognized that many congregations who could not afford male pastors relied on women preachers. Despite the fact that opposition to female pastors had been regularly affirmed since 1914, the office of pastor was opened to women in 1935.|$|E
30|$|Informed by {{implicit}} leadership theories, {{this study}} investigates contemporary Chinese employees’ preferences <b>for</b> paternalistic <b>leadership</b> (including three components: moral leadership, benevolent leadership and authoritarian leadership) and transformational leadership. It further examines {{the relationship between}} power distance orientation, core self-evaluation (CSE) and leadership preferences. The study finds that contemporary Chinese employees most prefer moral leadership, but are also highly receptive to transformational leadership. They prefer authoritarian leadership least. Moreover, preferences <b>for</b> authoritarian <b>leadership</b> are predicated on followers’ power distance orientation. However, {{the opposite is true}} <b>for</b> moral <b>leadership.</b> CSE is positively related to followers’ preference <b>for</b> authoritarian <b>leadership,</b> benevolent leadership and transformational leadership, but not except <b>for</b> moral <b>leadership.</b> A positive interaction effect is found between power distance orientation and CSE with regard to authoritarian leadership preference. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.|$|R
