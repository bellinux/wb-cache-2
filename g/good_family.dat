5|$|Their fur is {{darker than}} other spaniels {{and they have}} no {{undercoat}} like most of the other field type spaniels. Their coats come mostly in solid colours with some occasional markings on the chest. They can make <b>good</b> <b>family</b> dogs and are patient with children, but can require some sort of purpose, be it hunting or agility work in order to prevent them from becoming bored and destructive.|$|E

Around 1905, Coffin set up her own office at the National Arts Club and began taking commissions, using her family {{connections}} to find work. She was ideally situated; it was the height of the Country Place Era, when wealthy East Coast Americans were eager to develop elaborate European-style gardens for their estates. Coffin was well-connected in such circles, widely traveled, came from a <b>good</b> <b>family,</b> was professionally trained and was known for her good taste.

5|$|The Field Spaniel {{can be a}} <b>good</b> <b>family</b> dog {{while it}} has a job to do. They are {{suitable}} for dog agility and hunting. Without some sort of purpose, the dog can often try to amuse itself and cause mischief. However, they are patient with children and like {{to stay close to}} their family. When socialised, they are good with other dogs. They are generally docile and independent, and are not as excitable as Cocker Spaniels. Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs lists the breed as being above average in working intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Jon Snow {{is first}} {{introduced}} in A Game of Thrones (1996), {{as he and}} his five siblings adopt six orphaned direwolf cubs. As Ned Stark's illegitimate son and with Ned's wife Catelyn despising him, Jon has always felt removed {{from the rest of the}} Stark family. He resolves to join the Night's Watch, as his status as a bastard prevents him from holding lands or marrying into a <b>good</b> <b>family.</b> At The Wall, the other recruits resent Jon's aura of superiority, but he makes amends by helping them master swordplay. He also befriends Samwell Tarly, a cowardly lordling who, despite being helpless with weapons, displays an aptitude for book learning. Jon's independence and his compassion for the recruits invite the ire of the harsh master-at-arms Alliser Thorne, who sees Jon as a threat to his authority. Jon gains the notice of the Lord Commander, Jeor Mormont, who names Jon his personal squire and grooms Jon for command. After learning of his father's execution, Jon resolves to desert the Night's Watch and join his half brother Robb, but the other recruits convince Jon to remain loyal to his Night's Watch vows. The next night, Jon saves Mormont's life by killing an undead wight. Mormont then orders a Great Ranging beyond the Wall to learn more of this new threat.|$|E

25|$|By 1955 it {{was clear}} that the club could not remain at the County Ground and in the {{following}} year it moved to a very small ground next to the Withdean Stadium in Brighton. Here the club enjoyed a <b>good</b> <b>family</b> atmosphere, but the facilities were primitive and the use of the ground as a rugby pitch during the winter, and even as a collecting ring for a horse show, made playing-conditions dangerous. The Club found a temporary refuge at Longhill School in 1969 before moving to Horsdean.|$|E

25|$|Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers {{are known}} to be very intelligent, curious, alert, outgoing, and high-energy dogs.
