Comparison of cumulative interpretation results with actual ground truth data indicates that although there is definite decrease in interpretability as ground resolvable distance increases, some valuable information is gained by using even the poorest aerial photography. Developed is the importance of shape and texture for correct identification of broadleaf or coniferous vegetation types and the relative unimportance of shape and texture for the recognition of <b>grassland,</b> water <b>bodies,</b> and nonvegetated areas.

Moreover, <b>grassland</b> and water <b>bodies</b> are season dependent, so the increase and decrease in these classes highlights the use of images of at least two different seasons as the season always effect agriculture and grass cover.|$|R

We collected hunter-harvest data for 1, 731 white-tailed deer from DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge in eastern Nebraska and western Iowa from 2003 to 2010. We used linear mixed-effects models and information theoretic methods to estimate effects of density of white-tailed deer and proportion of total landcover area converted from cropland to cool- or warm-season <b>grassland</b> on <b>body</b> mass of white-tailed deer. Density of white-tailed deer at DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge ranged from 36. 5 to 50. 6 deer/km 2, {{and the proportion of}} landcover at DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge that remained cropland each year ranged from 14. 9 to 23. 2 %. Body mass was inversely related to population density (21. 4 kg/ 5. 5 deer/km 2) and proportion of cropland (21. 3 kg/ 3. 1 % conversion of total land area from cropland to grassland). We used auxiliary harvest data collected at Boyer Chute National Wildlife Refuge to validate our models and found our models performed well. We estimate densities of white-tailed deer must be reduced by 1. 7 (SE = 0. 6) deer/km 2 for every 1 % change in total landcover from cropland to grassland in order for white-tailed deer to maintain body mass.

During the past two decades, the Land Use/Cover Change has been considered {{as one of the most}} important reasons for the eco-environment degeneration in Loess Plateau. In this paper, land use data in 1990, 1995 and 2000 were got based on the Landsat TM Remote Sensing images, and the 1 km-grid land use change data of 1990 - 1995, 1995 - 2000 and 1990 - 2000 was made using the data management and spatial analysis techniques of ArcGIS 8. 3 software. Furthermore, statistical tabular data of Grain for Green Project on county level in recent years were joined in the administrative regionalism spatial data. Based on all of these data, temporal-spatial characteristics of land use change in Loess Plateau were studied in detail, and its driving forces were discussed either. It turned out that land use change in different periods had very different characteristics. On the whole, from 1990 to 2000, farmland and built-up increased greatly, and forest, <b>grassland,</b> water <b>body</b> and unused land decreased remarkably. On the contrary, conversions from farmland and unused to forest or grassland has become the dominant land use change process since 2000. The regional social-economic development and the national macro-control policy have been the most important driving forces of land use change since 1990.

There were generated digital geographic maps about geology, soils, hydrology, minimum and maximum temperatures, rain, human settlements and roads. The LANDSAT images for 1992 and for the 2000 were used and classified using Chuvieco Mixed Classification Method (1995). Vegetation and land use maps were generated for the year 1990 and 2000 using verification field points and the maps generated were overlaid to produce a change map and variation matrix.

Erdas Imagine 9. 2 and Arc-GIS. 10 were applied. The change patterns were obtained by superposing land cover maps for 1992 and 2010. The field data were collected by the mean of inventories according to the Braun-Blanquet phytosociological relevés methods. Plot sizes were 50 m x 20 m for woody species and  10 m x 10 m for herbaceous species. Six land cover types were identified and mapped: cultivated lands, bared lands, lowlands, which all spatially increased; and shrub-steppes, <b>grasslands</b> and water <b>bodies,</b> which all spatially decreased. The dynamic patterns based on the geomorphological units were non-degraded lowlands, stable sand dunes and degraded glacis.  High plant diversity was found in lowlands, whereas low diversity occurred in glacis.

Understanding land use/cover change {{and its effect}} on groundwater depth would enhance land use and groundwater management for typical desert-oasis transition zones. Reduction of groundwater recharge and increase of groundwater exploitation during 1985 and 2010 led to the decrease of groundwater depth in Linze County. The region with groundwater depth less than 5 m decreased by 187 km 2 from 1985 to 2010 as a result of industrial growth, agricultural and economic development. Land use has undergone significant spatial and temporal changes. Farmland and built up land expanded by 53. 02 % and 30. 91 %, respectively. The expansion of farmland reached a peak between 1996 and 2005 with an increasing rate of 25. 70 %, while areas of <b>grassland,</b> woodland, water <b>body</b> and unused land decreased, and the decreasing rate was 9. 38 %, 58. 35 % and 19. 81 %. From 1985 to 2010, the groundwater depth rose slightly (0 – 1. 2 m) in the edge of desert (24. 21 km 2), which was caused by the surrounding farmland irrigation recharge. The drawdown range of groundwater depth between 0 and 3 m was distributed in the central oasis, which was caused by the expansion of farmland and degradation of natural vegetation. This study aims to provide a basis for the reasonable utilization of water resources, the formation of management strategies, as well as to provide ecosystem stability and sustainable development of oases in the study area...|$|R
30|$|LU/LC {{changes are}} also common {{phenomena}} in Ethiopia. There was a {{rapid expansion of}} cultivated land {{at the expense of}} vegetative land cover types {{in various parts of the}} country. For example, Gete and Hurni (2001) study in Dembecha area of northwestern Ethiopia showed an increase of cultivated land from 39 % in 1957 to 77 % in 1995 while natural forest declined from 27 to 0.3 %. The decline of forest cover from 50.9 to 16.7 % was also observed in Upper Gilgel Abbay catchment of Blue Nile basin between 1973 and 2001 periods, basically due to the expansion of agricultural land (Rientjes et al. 2011). Gessesse and Kleman (2007) study in the South Central Rift Valley Region of Ethiopia also showed the reduction of natural forest cover from 16 % in 1972 to 2.8 % in 2000, which amounts to a total natural forest loss of 40, 324  ha. In the entire area of Blue Nile basin also there had been a shrinking of wooded grassland, wood land, shrubs and bushes, natural forest and afro-alpine vegetation between 1973 and 2000 periods while rain fed cropland, <b>grassland,</b> water <b>body</b> and barren land had increased. The increase of water body is due to the construction of different dams in the basin (Gebremicael et al. 2013). Belay (2002) study in Derekolli catchment of the South Wello Zone also reported the decline of scrubland at the rate of 1.6 and 0.31 % per year between 1957 – 1986 and 1986 – 2000, respectively. In contrast, cropland had increased from 65.1 % in 1957 to 70.6 % in 2000. In Northern Afar rangelands also a rapid reduction in woodland cover (97 %) and grassland cover (88 %) from 1972 to 2007 were reported, and in contrary bush land cover and cultivated land increased more than three and eightfold, respectively (Diress et al. 2010). A decrease in coverage of scrublands, riverine vegetation and forests, and an increase in open areas, settlements, floodplains, and water body were also observed in Kalu District of Southern Wello between 1958 and 1986 periods (Kebrom and Hedlund 2000). While, some studies conducted in the previously degraded parts of northern Ethiopia, revealed improvement of vegetation cover due to community afforestation and land rehabilitation activity (Amare (2007) and Amare et al. (2011) in Eastern Escarpment of Wello, Ethiopia; Muluneh (2003) in west Gurage land and Munro et al. (2008) in Tigray highlands). The increase of forest cover was also reported in Chemoga watershed from 1957 – 1998 periods (Woldeamlak 2002).|$|R

The approach relies on {{the identification of the}} traits that mediatethe linkages between adjacent trophic levels, i. e. ‘trait-matching’. Yet, how trait-matchingexplains the abundance and diversity of animal communities has been barely explored. Thisquestion may be particularly critical in the context of land-use intensification, currently threateningbiodiversity and associated ecosystem services. 2. We collected a large dataset on plant and grasshopper traits from communities living in 204 grasslands, in an intensively managed agricultural landscape. We used a multi-traitapproach to quantify the relative contributions of trait-matching and land-use intensificationacting at both local and landscape scales on grasshopper functional diversity. We consideredtwo key independent functional traits: incisor strength and body size of grasshopperspecies. Incisor strength, a resource-acquisition trait, strongly matches grasshopper feedingniche. Body size correlates with mobility traits, and may determine grasshopper dispersalabilities. 3. Plant functional diversity positively impacted the diversity of grasshopper resource-acquisitiontraits, according to the degree of trait-matching observed between plants and herbivores. However, this positive effect was significantly higher in old grasslands. In addition, the presenceof specific habitats in the landscape (i. e. wood and alfalfa) strongly enhanced grasshopperresource-acquisition trait diversity in the focal <b>grassland.</b> Finally, grasshopper <b>body</b> sizeincreased with landscape simplification, although the response was modulated by local factorssuch as soil depth. 4. Trait-matching between plants and herbivores was an important driver explaining the abundanceand diversity of resource-acquisition traits within grasshopper communities. However,the presence of specific habitats in the surrounding landscape had also a strong influence onherbivore functional diversity in grasslands.

40|$|Daily maximum surface air {{temperature}} (Tamax) {{is a crucial}} factor for understanding complex land surface processes under rapid climate change. Remote detection of Tamax has widely relied on the empirical relationship between {{air temperature}} and land surface temperature (LST), a product derived from remote sensing. However, {{little is known about}} how such a relationship is affected by the high heterogeneity in landscapes and dynamics in seasonality. This study aims to advance our understanding of the roles of land cover and seasonal variation in the estimation of Tamax using the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) LST product. We developed statistical models to link Tamax and LST in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China for five major land-cover types (i. e., forest, shrub, water, impervious surface, cropland, and grassland) and two seasons (i. e., growing season and non-growing season). Results show that the performance of modeling the Tamax-LST relationship was highly dependent on land cover and seasonal variation. Estimating Tamax over <b>grasslands</b> and water <b>bodies</b> achieved superior performance; while uncertainties were high over forested lands that contained extensive heterogeneity in species types, plant structure, and topography. We further found that all the land-cover specific models developed for the plant non-growing season outperformed the corresponding models developed for the growing season. Discrepancies in model performance mainly occurred in the vegetated areas (forest, cropland, and shrub), suggesting an important role of plant phenology in defining the statistical relationship between Tamax and LST. For impervious surfaces, the challenge of capturing the high spatial heterogeneity in urban settings using the low-resolution MODIS data made Tamax estimation a difficult task, which was especially true in the growing season...|$|R
40|$|In a {{comparison}} of grassland, moorland and woodland habitats in north-east England, moorland sites {{were found to be}} the most diverse and species-rich and to support a carabid fauna of larger <b>body</b> size than <b>grassland</b> sites. Within the grassland sites, intensification of management resulted in a reduction both in species richness and in body size. The species composition of intensively managed sites differed from that of the less intensive, with management appearing to favour species associated with drier conditions. Similarly, a study of data from 110 sets of pitfall traps in managed and unmanaged grassland in Scotland found a general reduction in diversity, rarity and body size as management intensified, with silage fields having especially low values of WML. Diversity and rarity fell sharply between the second and third levels of management. Multivariate analysis of the species composition also made a clear distinction between these levels, grouping sites in bands 1 and 2 separately from those in bands 3 to 5. A more detailed examination {{of the effects of the}} different components of management found that body size was dependent mostly on the type and age of the sward, while diversity and rarity responded to nutrient inputs. In a subset of 36 of the 110 Scottish sites, the carabid assemblages of sown wildflower swards, sown grass and clover, and uncultivated <b>grassland</b> were compared. <b>Body</b> size, species richness and diversity were all highest in the unmanaged swards, and species richness and diversity were higher in wildflower swards than in sown grasses.

The employment of any supervised classifier demands exhaustive definition of land cover classes and the representation of all classes in the training stage. This paper reports the process of a data driven class separability analysis and the definition and application of a national land cover classification scheme. All Landsat data recorded over Mexico in the year 2000 with cloud coverage below 10 percent and a national digital elevation model have been used. Automatic wall- 2 -wall image classification has been performed trained by national reference data on land use and vegetation types with 66 classes. Validation has been performed against field plots of the national forest inventory. Groups of non-separable classes have subsequently been discerned by automatic iterative class aggregation. Class aggregations have finally been manually revised and modified towards a proposed national land cover classification scheme at 4 levels with 35 classes {{at the highest level}} including 13 classes for primary temperate and tropical forests, 2 classes for secondary temperate and tropical forest, 1 for induced or cultivated forest, as also 8 different scrubland classes. The remaining 11 classes cover agriculture, <b>grassland,</b> wetland, water <b>bodies,</b> urban and other vegetation land cover classes. The remaining 3 levels provide further hierarchic aggregations with 14, 10, and 8 classes, respectively. Trained by the relabeled training dataset wall- 2 -wall classification towards the 35 classes has been performed. The final national land cover dataset has been validated against more than 200, 000 polygons randomly distributed all over the country with class labels derived by manual interpretation. The agreement for all 35 classes at level 4 was 71 %. Primary forest classes have been identified with accuracies between 60 % and 83 %. Secondary forest classes rated only 50 % finding major confusion with the primary forest classes. Accuracies over the scrubland classes have been calculated between 60 % and 90 %.

40|$|Ecologists and {{conservation}} biologists {{are interested in}} explaining why animal abundance and reproductive success vary among habitats. Initial motivation for this research arose from concerns for Northern Pintail (Anas acuta) populations in North America. Unlike many prairie-nesting dabbling duck populations, pintails failed to increase during periods of excellent wetland conditions, and remained below conservation goals. Low pintail populations {{have been linked to}} degraded landscape conditions on the Canadian prairies. Current habitat management for pintails aims to protect and create larger areas of perennial cover either by encouraging better management of grazing lands, by converting cropland to grassland, or by promoting adoption of fall-seeded crops like winter wheat. The central premise is that larger areas of natural grassland cover will attract breeding pintails to nest earlier in the season in low-predation-risk habitat. I studied pintail nesting ecology near the Milk River Ridge, Alberta, 2004 - 2006, in terms of a life-cycle perspective, from spring arrival and settling on breeding areas, to assess age and quality of nesting females, to determine timing and investment in reproduction, and finally to measure nesting success. A gradient in presumed high (grassland) to low (agriculture) habitat quality provided a landscape template for testing habitat selection models. Pintail breeding pair densities were 1. 5 - 3 times higher in grassland than agricultural landscapes in all three years, regardless of regional population size, with pairs occupying grassland landscapes at higher densities immediately upon arrival in early spring. Northern Shoveler (A. clypeata), gadwall (A. strepera) and blue-wing teal (A. discors) had similar settlement patterns as pintails, but mallard (A. platyrhynchos) pair density was higher in agricultural areas. Relatively more, older female pintails were captured at nests in grassland landscapes whereas yearling females were encountered more often in agricultural areas, a pattern that was not detected in female shovelers. This response suggests that older female pintails may be better able to recognize and settle in higher quality <b>grassland</b> habitats. <b>Body</b> mass of pintail females did not vary among years, decreased seasonally, and was positively related to body size index and incubation stage. Furthermore, pintail body mass did not differ between grassland (650 ± 24 g), ecotone (678 ± 27 g) and agriculture (672 ± 33 g). In female shovelers, body mass varied among years (555 ± 29 g in 2004, 481 ± 18 g in 2005, 508 ± 21 g in 2006), and increased with nesting date. Shoveler body mass did not differ between grassland (519 ± 32 g), ecotone (519 ± 44 g), or agriculture (507 ± 35 g). Nest initiation dates did not vary by landscape for pintail, shoveler or mallard, but all species nested earlier in 2006 versus 2004. In pintail, shoveler and mallard, clutch size was negatively related to nest initiation date. Pintail and shoveler clutch sizes were generally larger in a wet year with abundant wetlands (2006) when compared with a dry year (2004), but no landscape differences were detected. Mallard clutch size did not vary by year or landscape. Female reproductive timing and investment (in terms of clutch size) were unrelated to upland habitat characteristics, counter to a hypothesis that predicts larger pintail clutch sizes in agricultural landscapes. However, pintail and shoveler invested in larger clutches in 2006, a wet year with abundant wetlands, possibly due to greater abundance of aquatic foods. Finally, nest survival rates of duck species, except mallard, tended to be higher in grassland landscapes and lower in agricultural landscapes. Pintail nest survival was consistently higher in grassland than in agricultural landscapes and was highest in 2006 when wetland conditions were excellent. Shoveler and blue-winged teal nest survival rates did not vary strongly with landscape, but were also higher in 2006, whereas mallard and gadwall nest survival estimates did not vary with landscape or year. Overall, pintails settled at higher densities in grassland landscapes where breeding success was higher (indexed by nesting success). This suggests that pintails respond appropriately to cues that enable them to recognize suitable habitat, at least in regions where large contiguous areas of grassland habitat remain. Furthermore, assuming that findings for pintails reflect those of other grassland bird species, large remnant areas of intact natural grassland seem particularly in need of protection or restoration, and management regimes that maintain their habitat integrity. By integrating applied and theoretical aspects of pintail reproductive ecology, I attempted to provide deeper insights into the processes that could shape behavioral decisions by breeding pintails and other duck species. Older pintails may occupy wetlands in higher quality grassland habitat early in spring, forcing subordinate or later-arriving individuals into poorer quality habitat (i. e., where nesting success is lower); however, mechanisms involved in this putative process are unknown. Overall, results suggest that grassland restoration or enhancement (e. g., managing grazing intensity) could improve reproductive success of pintails and possibly other grassland bird species...|$|R
