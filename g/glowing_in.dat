25|$|All three Houses {{fight against}} the Guild in a race against time to destroy the Emperor Worm before it awakens, with a {{different}} ending for each House depicting their units destroying the Worm. One such ending reveals that, from {{the wreckage of the}} Emperor Worm's scaffold, red eyes are <b>glowing</b> <b>in</b> the dark, which perhaps suggests that the Worm survives. Should the player fail to defeat the Emperor Worm, then it becomes crowned as the new leader of the Empire of Man.|$|E
25|$|While <b>glowing</b> <b>in</b> {{praise for}} the helicopter's {{advances}} over piston-engined helicopters, the Army reports from the service tests of the YH-40 {{found it to be}} underpowered with the production T53-L-1A powerplant producing a maximum continuous 770 shaft horsepower (570 kilowatts). The Army indicated the need for improved follow-on models even as the first UH-1As were being delivered. In response, Bell proposed the UH-1B, equipped with the Lycoming T53-L-5 engine producing 960shp (720kW) and a longer cabin that could accommodate either seven passengers or four stretchers and a medical attendant. Army testing of the UH-1B started in November 1960, with the first production aircraft delivered in March 1961.|$|E
25|$|Edmund Roberts {{calls the}} island Crokatoa in his journal. A paraphrased account follows: On 8 September 1832, US sloop-of war Peacock {{anchored}} off the north end, also visiting Long Island, {{in search of}} inhabitants, fresh water, and yams. It was found difficult to effect a landing anywhere, owing to a heavy surf and to the coral having extended itself to a considerable distance from the shore. Hot springs boiling furiously up, through many fathoms of water, {{were found on the}} eastern side of Krakatoa, 150 feet from the shore. Roberts, Captain Geisinger, and marine Lieutenant Fowler visited Forsaken island, having mistaken the singing of locusts for the sound of running water. The boat glided over crystal clear water, over an extensive and highly beautiful submarine garden. Corals of every shape and hue were there; some resembling sunflowers and mushrooms; others, cabbages from an inch to three feet in diameter: while a third bore a striking likeness to the rose. The hillsides were typical of tropical climate; large flocks of parrots, monkeys in great variety, wild-mango and orange groves—a superb scene of plants and flowers of every description, <b>glowing</b> <b>in</b> vivid tints of purple, red, blue, brown, and green—but not the so-much-needed supply of water and provisions.|$|E
50|$|Both blacklight and <b>glow</b> <b>in</b> {{the dark}} inks {{have been used}} for tattooing. <b>Glow</b> <b>in</b> the dark ink absorbs and retains light, and then <b>glows</b> <b>in</b> darkened {{conditions}} by process of phosphorescence. Blacklight ink does not <b>glow</b> <b>in</b> the dark, but reacts to non-visible UV light, producing a visible glow by fluorescence. The resulting glow of both these inks is highly variable.|$|R

2500|$|Following {{the success}} of the Japanese {{pavilion}} at the Venice Biennale in 1993, a dazzling mirrored room filled with small pumpkin sculptures in which she resided in color-coordinated magician's attire, Kusama went on to produce a huge, yellow pumpkin sculpture covered with an optical pattern of black spots. The pumpkin came to represent for her a kind of alter-ego or self-portrait. Kusama's later installation I'm Here, but Nothing (2000–2008) is a simply furnished room consisting of table and chairs, place settings and bottles, armchairs and rugs, however its walls are tattooed with hundreds of fluorescent polka dots <b>glowing</b> <b>in</b> the UV light. The result is an endless infinite space where the self and everything in the room is obliterated.|$|E
2500|$|No {{physical}} description of Jesus {{is contained in}} any of the canonical Gospels. [...] In the Acts of the Apostles, Jesus is said to have manifested as a [...] "light from heaven" [...] that temporarily blinded the Apostle Paul, but no specific form is given. In the Book of Revelation there is a vision the author had of [...] "someone like a Son of Man" [...] in spirit form: [...] "dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest. His head and hair were white like wool, and his eyes were like blazing fire. His feet were like bronze <b>glowing</b> <b>in</b> a furnace (…) His face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance." [...] (Revelation 1:12–16, NIV). Use in art of the Revelation description of Jesus has generally been restricted to illustrations of the book itself, and nothing in the scripture confirms the spiritual form's resemblance to the physical form Jesus took in his life on Earth.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 November at 5:30 P.M., Carnegie left, {{saying to}} his {{geophysicist}} Chris Van Galder {{that he would}} return by 7:00 for supper. His bush pilot Todd Svarckopf warned him to not walk {{in the snow and}} play hockey in the airport's hangar for a substitution, but Carnegie disregarded the warning. He went for a walk in the snow, but did not return to the surveyor camp. At 7:30, a search was mounted. The camp's co-owner Mark Eikel drove out in a truck with Van Galder and Svarckopf searching for him. Carnegie's tracks were followed to the lake shore. On noticing wolf tracks on the shore, the three searchers went back for a rifle before continuing. Carnegie's body was found a little further on, but there were no wolves in sight at that time. Using a flashlight, the body was viewed from about 10m (32ft), many wolf tracks were visible around the body. [...] Later, when the body was being recovered, two sets of eyes were seen <b>glowing</b> <b>in</b> the dark close by. In addition, party searchers heard a wolf pack howling around the camp's vicinity.|$|E
