The bay laurel and the <b>dwarf</b> <b>fan</b> <b>palm</b> are also found {{in parts of the}} maquis. Understory plants include the intermediate periwinkle, Butcher’s broom, Italian arum and Bear's breech. The firebreaks in the maquis are home to plants such as paper-white narcissus, common asphodel, giant Tangier fennel, wild gladiolus, Galactites and mallow bindweed.|$|E
40|$|<b>Dwarf</b> <b>fan</b> <b>palm</b> (Chamaerops humilis) {{plays an}} {{important}} ecological role in the thermo Mediterranean vegetation stage, both in woodlands, xerophitic shrub communities and degraded ecosystems. <b>Dwarf</b> <b>fan</b> <b>palm</b> is typically propagated from seeds. Whereas other palm species show reduced germination after few months of seed storage, no information {{is available on the}} effects of storage time on seed germinability. We examined the germination pattern of dwarf palm seeds aged after a storage of four, six or eight months in comparison to fresh seed (control). A covariance analysis was performed to test the effect of time within seed-storage treatment. The germination patterns were significantly fitted by a S-shaped (sigmoidal) distribution function with the general equation y=β+α/(1 +exp(-(x-μ) /s)). Short-time storage significantly increased both final seed germination and maximum germination rate, and reduced mean germination time in comparison to unstored control. If considering that we did not make any seed treatment before sowing, these results may be due to an increased oxygen diffusion and water permeability through the seed hard coat during time...|$|E

40|$|<b>Dwarf</b> <b>fan</b> <b>palm</b> (Chamaerops humilis L.) is an {{important}} Mediterranean species well known for many uses such as gardening, environmental restoration, and technological uses. <b>Dwarf</b> <b>fan</b> <b>palm</b> is usually propagated from seed, which takes up to 100 days to germinate. The germination pattern of dwarf palm seeds was studied during a 100 -days length period in relation to different pre-sowing treatments (hot water, sulphuric acid, or mechanical scarification) in comparison to untreated control. A covariance analysis was performed to test the effect of time within seed-treatment treatment. All germination patterns were significantly fitted by a S-shaped (sigmoidal) distribution function with the general equation y=β+α/(1 +exp(-(x-μ) /s)). Treatment with sulphuric acid significantly increased the final germination in comparison to untreated control. No differences were observed in % germination among the other seed treatments. Seed treatments increased by three to seven fold the maximum germination rate and reduced by 26 % the mean germination time in comparison to untreated control. The reduction in mean germination time, {{and the increase in}} percentage germination and germination rate may have economical implication in the production of dwarf palm and its involvement in environmental restoration strategies, with no need to use dangerous or expensive acid pre-treatment in order to increase the propagation success...|$|E
40|$|The {{red palm}} weevil Rhynchophorus ferrugineus was {{recently}} introduced into Europe {{where it has}} destroyed many Phoenix canariensis palms. This weevil attacks different species of palms in different countries, mainly cultivated date palms (Phoenix dactylifera) in Egypt and cultivated Canary palms (Phoenix canariensis) in Europe. In Europe, sporadic attacks of the weevil to native <b>dwarf</b> <b>fan</b> <b>palm</b> (Chamaerops humilis) have been reported. The current paper reports attacks of R. ferrugineus on dwarf fan palms in natural environments of Sicily.

40|$|The {{biological}} invasions represent today {{a serious}} ecological problem, {{and is one}} of the main threats to biodiversity, in Italy as in the rest of the world. In the last century several species of palm trees have been introduced in gardens, parks and lanes of great part of Italy, where climate allows their life and growth. Among the others Phoenix canariensis, P. dactylifera, Washingtonia robusta, W. filifera, Jubaea spectabilis and Trachycarpus fortunei. All of these species are exotic, as the only indigenous palm in Italy is the <b>dwarf</b> <b>fan</b> <b>palm</b> (Chamaerops humilis), which occurs along the tirrenian coast from Sicily to Liguria, in Sardinia and most of the smaller islands. Palm trees have become by now part of the Italian landscape, as do pine tree in Rome or cypress in Tuscany. Recently, two different species of exotic insects where recorded for the first time in Italy: the south American moth Paysandisia archon and the chinese beetle Rhynchophorus ferrugineus. Both of them lay their eggs on palm trees, and their larvae feed into the stem and kill the palms. Both arrived in Italy and in other Mediterranean countries as larvae or eggs hidden into the plants imported from the native regions. These insects are rapidly spreading through Italy, following palm plantations, and destroying palms from north to south, with a huge economic damage. Furthermore, they are locally changing probably for ever the Italian landscape. More recently, there is evidence of infestation on <b>dwarf</b> <b>fan</b> <b>palm</b> by both the moth and the beetle. This could cause a local extinction of the palm...|$|E
25|$|In {{the past}} such a toponym, {{indicating}} {{the presence of}} <b>dwarf</b> <b>fan</b> <b>palms</b> on the spot, was recorded in some written documents. The theologian and writer Salvatore Vidal, speaking of the Sinis peninsula in his Clypeus Aureus excellentiae calaritanae (1641), reports the toponym Montigu de Prama. The Franciscan friar Antonio Felice Mattei, who wrote in the 18th century a historiography of Sardinian dioceses and bishops, mentions Montigu Palma {{as one of the}} localities within the Sinis peninsula.|$|R
50|$|The {{beach is}} also {{sometimes}} referred to locally as Praia dos Três Penecos (beach of triple rocks). This because of the location of three large isolated rock formations which dominate {{the line of the}} horizon from the beach. The tops of the formations are dotted with plants resistant to salt spray, such as Wormleaf Saltwort and Rock Samphire, which survive and grow on the rocks because the tops are well above the high tide level. Above the small beach, the cliff tops are populated by pine trees and examples of the <b>Dwarf</b> <b>Fan</b> <b>Palms,</b> the only palm native to Europe.|$|R

30|$|Mexican Washingtonian trees, Washingtonia robusta, are {{a member}} of the family Arecaceae, which is native to Northwestern Mexico. It is one of the most {{regularly}} planted palm trees around the world as an ornamental plant (Broschat 2018). Although considered a desert palm, it is native to regions having permanent surface or subsurface water (Broschat 2018). A disorder resulting in the death of 4 – 5 -year-old W. roubsta palms in a farm north of Al Shehia district, Al Qassim region, Saudi Arabia, was brought to our attention in March 2015. Many fungal species have been reported to cause bud roots in palm trees, including Botryodiplodia, Chalara (Thielaviopsis), Colletotrichum, and Fuasrium. Phytophthora species, oomycetes, also caused various diseases on various palms including seedling blights and damping off, trunk and leaf spots, crown and root rots, blights and petiole rots; nut drop; and apical, bud, or heart rot, followed by plant death (Garofalo and McMillan 1999). About 59 identified species of Phytophthora are known as pathogens causing disease in roots, crowns, stems, leaves, and fruits of a wide range of agricultural plant species (Erwin and Ribeiro 1996). Phytophthora is a soil-borne fungus-like organism from the water mold group (Ho 2018). Phytophthora bud rot is one of the most common diseases detected in palms in wet tropical climates (Garofalo and McMillan 1999). Phytophthora nicotianae (synonym = P. parasitica) has been reported to infect ornamental palms, more than 301 different ornamental plants and vegetable hosts such as onion, Allium cepa; carnation, Dianthus caryophillus; tomato, Lycopersicum esculentum; and poinsettia, uphorbia pulcherrima. It was recently reported to infect <b>dwarf</b> <b>fan</b> <b>palm,</b> Chamaero pshumilis, in Iran and Italy (Faedda et al. 2011 and Nazerian and Mirabolfathi 2013). Several Lysobacter spp. including L. enzymogenes, L. antibioticus, and L. capsici (Hayward et al. 2010) reported to have the potential as one of the biological control agents for plant diseases. 3.1 T 8 and OH 11 strains of L. enzymogenes were very effective in inhibiting the mycelial growth of Phytophthora capsici, Pythium ultimum, Py. aphanidermatum, Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium graminearum, Ralstonia solanacearum, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Christensen & Cook, 1978, Folman et al. 2003, Jiang et al. 2005, and Qian et al. 2009).|$|E
