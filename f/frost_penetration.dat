Nail length, diameter and spacing typically control external and internal stability of the wall. These parameters can be adjusted during design until all external and internal stability requirements are met. After the initial design is completed, final design progresses where the soil nail wall has to be tested for external and internal failure modes, seismic considerations and aesthetic qualities.

40|$|Because of the {{different}} mix design in comparison with traditional concrete {{and the absence of}} vibration, different durability characteristics might be expected for self-compacting concrete (SCC). Indeed, the degradation mechanisms of a cementitious material are greatly influenced by the permeability of the material for potentially aggressive substances. As the pore Structure might be different for SCC in comparison with traditional concrete, some changes in durability behaviour might be noticed. This paper is first giving an overview of hydration, pore structure, air-void system and transport mechanisms of self-compacting concrete. Afterwards, available durability results are studied and summarised keeping in mind the fundamental mechanisms and driving forces. In this way some more general view on durability of Self-Compacting Concrete is obtained.

40|$|The natural risks {{have been}} {{considered}} the most important source of crop damages in the Hungarian agriculture for a long time. In spite of this fact due to the lacking supply of insurance in the last 20 years the farmers could not contract insurance policies to cover the most important crop damage risks as drought, inland waters and spring <b>frost.</b> Moreover the <b>penetration</b> of insurable risks for instance the hailstorm has not covered 40 percent of the arable land in none of {{the years of the}} analyzed period. The NAR (National Crop Damage Compensation System) founded in 2006 has extended the eligible risks to cover farmers’ damages, but the compensation reached only 10 - 20 percent of crop damages in the last two years. The solution could be a new system based on the combination of the risk portfolio of the NAR and of the insurance companies subsidized by the government.

40|$|Rain {{is one of}} {{the main}} causes of {{moisture}} damage to the building envelope, leading to problems such as rain <b>penetration,</b> <b>frost</b> and salt damage, discoloration by leaching, soiling by differential washing, etc. The potential of deterioration due to rain depends on the façade material, the junction of building envelope components, the overall geometry of the building, but also the presence or absence of modulation on the façade. In this paper, Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are used to analyze these effects and illustrated with examples taken in Sicily. It is firstly shown that buildings protect themselves from driving rain due to the wind blocking effect, but that façade openings can lead to increased deposit of driving rain due to occurrence of high wind velocities originating from pressure shortcuts. The importance of façade modulation by cornices or roof overhangs for shelter and deflection of rain is next demonstrated. It is further highlighted that these modulations should include drips to shed rain water running down the façade. Façades without moisture buffering by capillary action of façade materials are found to be very sensitive to staining due to run-off of dirty water from horizontal modulations. Finally, an example illustrates the sensitivity to rain penetration and degradation of face-seal façades...|$|R

They were made in natural soil and water- main {{trenches}} and were done to establish methods of determining depth of <b>frost</b> <b>penetration,</b> paying special attention to the question of depth, of soil cover over water and sewer mains to prevent freezing. Observations were carried out at 21 stations using special probes at different depths to measure temperature and thermal conductivity, both in bare and snow covered areas. Field observations were used to verify calculation methods. A calculation method was used to determine the <b>frost</b> <b>penetration</b> for five different types of soil at varying mean annual temperatures and minimum winter temperatures. Observations showed that the heat insulating capacity of snow is less than could be expected from its thermal conductivity, mostly because the structure of the snow is continually changing. Therefore an equivalent conductivity was used which depends on the mean annual temperature. Special treatment was given to the depth of soil required over water-mains, which allows for the heating effect of the water carried in the pipes. For the frost protection of service pipes to buildings a practical method suggested is to use electrical heating to compensate for heat losses.

40|$|Phase {{change of}} the water in the soil {{skeleton}} under cold climate conditions (also known as frost action in soils) affects soil properties and can be responsible for serious alterations in a soil body; causing damages (due to the volumetric expansion known as frost heave) to structures on or below the ground surface such as foundations, roads, railways, retaining walls and pipelines, etc. In order to improve the current design methods for roads against frost action, the Swedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket) has initiated a research program. The main goals of the program are to revise the existing frost heave estimation methods and improve the frost susceptibility classification system for subgrade soils. Literature was reviewed to gather the details of different freezing test equipment around the world and to identify common trends and practices for laboratory freezing tests. Based on the literature review and the collaboration with the University of Oulu, Finland an experimental apparatus was assembled for studying frost action in the laboratory. A detailed description of the experimental apparatus is given. Top to down freezing of specimens (of 10 cm height and diameter) can be monitored while keeping track of water intake, vertical displacements (heave) and the temperature profile within the sample. Loads can be applied {{at the top of the}} sample to study the effects of overburden. Moreover, the test setup was modified with a camera system to have the option of recording the experiments. Disturbed samples of two different soil types were tested. Experiments with fixed and varying temperature boundary conditions were conducted to assess the validity of the assumptions for the frost heave estimation methods currently in use in Sweden. To this end, a qualitative relationship between frost heave and heat extraction rates based on theoretical equations was established. It was shown that there is a significant difference between the preliminary findings of the experimental work and the current system being used in Sweden to quantify heave. Image analysis techniques were used on two experiments that were recorded by the camera system. Image recording and correlation analyses provided detailed information about <b>frost</b> front <b>penetration</b> and ice lens formation(s) under varying temperature boundary conditions. Thawing has also been regarded in further studies. Results of the image analyses were compared to readings from conventional displacement measurements during the same test. Significant agreement between the results of image analyses and displacement measurements has been found. Image analysis was shown to be a viable method in further understanding of frost heave mechanisms. Shortcomings and disadvantages of utilizing the theoretical equations as well as the image analysis techniques were discussed. Potential remedies for overcoming the drawbacks associated with each approach are suggested. The work is concluded by discussing the potential improvements, planned upgrades (addition of pore pressure transducers) and the future experiments to be conducted...|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} {{a study of}} the road {{environment}} around two motorway-bridges around Göteborg is presented. The study is a completion of an earlier study, made during the autumns of 1998 and 1999, where seven concrete motorway-bridges around Göteborg have been studied regarding moisture conditions, chloride <b>penetration,</b> <b>frost</b> damage and reinforcement corrosion. The results from this study show on large variations, especially in chloride penetration, both between different bridges, but also on one single bridge. The new study has been initiated to confirm and further investigate the results from this earlier study. The study has been carried out by exposing specimens made from mortar on bridgecolumns. The specimens are manufactured at one occasion with the same mortar composition to minimise variations in the results due to the execution and the material composition. The specimens have been exposed on two of the bridges investigated in the earlier study. Two bridges are bridge O 951, which is situated along the motorway E 6 some 20 km south of Göteborg, and bridge O 978, which is situated along the motorway Rv 40 some 15 km east of Göteborg. The exposure, made at different heights over the roadways and orientations towards the traffic, was started in the middle of February 2001, and was finished in the middle of May 2001. After finalising the exposure, the chloride penetration into each specimen has been determined by profile grinding in depth intervals and wet chemical analysis of the powder samples to determine the chloride and calcium content. The chloride penetration is presented as chloride penetration profiles where the quotient between the chloride and calcium content at different depths is presented. The results from the study show that the exposure for chlorides varies a lot depending on the height over the roadway and the orientation towards the traffic. The exposure for chloride was found to be largest for surfaces orientated towards the traffic on the same level as the roadway. Since de-icing salt normally is spread during the night or early in the morning, this means that surfaces that faces towards the morning traffic has the highest exposure to chlorides. This effect can be observed on bridge O 951, with marked commuter traffic to and from Göteborg, where the surface that faces towards the traffic towards Göteborg has significantly higher exposure for chlorides compared to the other surfaces. On bridge O 978, with less commuter traffic, this variation in exposure to chlorides cannot be observed. Furthermore, large chloride penetration was observed up to two meters above the roadway on bridge O 978. A possible explanation for this is a deposition of airborne chlorides at certain wind-directions on the lee-side of the column. This surface is not exposed to rain, that will wash the chlorides away, which means that the chlorides will be accumulated in the concrete. These results confirm the results from the study made during the autumns of 1998 and 1999...|$|R

40|$|After {{the winter}} of 1962 - 1963 the frost damage in the Netherlands to road constructions was enormous. The "Studie Centrum Wegenbouw" made {{inquiries}} on road constructors about this damage. A special commision was brought together to look after these inquiries. It proved that many physical aspects about <b>frost</b> <b>penetration</b> were unknown. One of the activities therefore {{had to be a}} study on <b>frost</b> <b>penetration</b> into soils. For this reason a new freezing model is derived. With this model values for frost depths and heave can be calculated with it. The new model differs from known models because of different assumptions. Two important conditions are the original temperature distribution and the original water distribution. Both are assumed to be linear functions of place. The interpretation of masstransport and frozen fringe differs from Jones and Miller. The transport is in agreement with Darcy's law. However, the quantity of transported mass is not only depending on the waterpotentialgradient itself, but also on the location of this gradient and on time. The importance of the factor time follows from the heatfluxes at the freezingfront. Model values are compared with experimental results. Three different types of setups are used. A closed system (no free water) was used to investigate the influence of watercontent on <b>frost</b> <b>penetration.</b> Moisted silversand was applied. The volumemetric watercontent, changed to 6 %. By the so called T. R. R. L. method an opensystem (free water available) was copied. Moistured morainesand was used.

Several tubes were placed at different locations into the soil. Airtemperatures and frostdepths were measured during winterperiods. The measurements of the winter 1979 are used here. Unfortunately there was no knowledge about several thermal parameters. The missing values were replaced by the numbers of morainesand. A simple numerical program is developed and used to find the calculated values for frostdepths and heaves. ...|$|E

The gravity foundations of wind power plants are often constructed as a reinforced concrete monolite. In the centre of the footing a steel cage is attached for anchoring the wind mill tower.

The roadway crossed ice-covered channels and intervening frozen channel bars. The airborne profiles were intended for ice thickness profiling but also revealed sporadic reflections from a deeper horizon beneath the bars. Later profiling {{from the surface}} recorded these deeper reflecting horizons in detail, and they were found to correspond with the base of seasonal frost, measured in drill holes. The sediments immediately beneath e frozen material were saturated and represented {{the top of a}} seasonally variable groundwater table confined and controlled by <b>frost</b> <b>penetration.</b> The profiles made from the surface also revealed reflections {{from the bottom of the}} ice and the channel bottom. However, no significant reflections were observed beneath the channel bottom; reflections from sloping horizons above and below the base of the frost in the bar may indicate alluvial bedding patterns in these deposits. Eleven holes were drilled along the roadway to determine ice thickness, water depth, frost depth and the depth to the river ice-alluvium contact. Wide-angle reflection and refraction soundings were also made to determine electrical properties of materials and to verify our depth interpretations from echo times.

Moreover, {{thermal stresses}} and strains must be evaluated to define the initial loading conditions for seismic safety analyses. In this study, finite element procedures to model the thermal response of concrete gravity dams are presented. Heat transfer and structural models of a typical dam-foundation-reservoir system are developed.

The rate of convergence of the numerical solution is examined, and a methodology to identify the critical temperature states and to compute the related stresses, considering creep, is presented. Extensive parametric analyses are then performed to determine the relative influence of (i) the geometrical, thermal, and mechanical properties of the dam, (ii) the reservoir, foundation and air temperature distributions, and (iii) the heat supply from solar radiation, on the stress-strain response of the system. Temperature states to define critical stress conditions for structural safety analysis are determined. Significant thermal stresses occur {{in the vicinity of the}} exposed surfaces of the dam.

The shallow annual <b>frost</b> <b>penetration</b> suggests that the site may {{be close to the}} limit of active solifluction in this area. Surface solifluction rates over the period 2002 – 06 ranged from 0. 5 cm yr 1 {{at the rear of the}} lobe tread to 1. 6 cm yr 1 just behind the lobe front, with corresponding soil transport rates of 6 cm 3 cm 1 yr 1 and 46 cm 3 cm 1 yr 1. Pore water pressure measurements indicated seepage of snowmelt beneath seasonally frozen soil in spring with artesian pressures beneath the confining frozen layer. Soil thawing was associated with surface settlement and downslope soil displacements, but following clearance of the frozen ground, later soil surface settlement was accompanied by retrograde movement. Summer rainfall events caused brief increases in pore pressure, but no further soil movement. Surface displacements exceeded maximum potential frost creep values and it is concluded that gelifluction was an important component of slow near-surface mass movements at this site. Temporal and spatial variations in solifluction rates across the area are likely to be considerable and strongly influenced b...|$|E
40|$|Abrtract. -A water-filled {{plastic tube}} buried {{vertically}} {{in the soil}} in a copper casing permitted repeated observation of frost depth without damaging the sampling site. The device is simple and inexpensive and provides data on soil freezing at least as accurate as direct observation by digging through frozen soil. Recent research reports about <b>frost</b> <b>penetration</b> in forest soils have relied on some admittedly unsatisfactory measurement techniques. Patric (I 967) used direct observation: holes dug through frozen to unfrozen soil, a method recognized as accurate but laborious and destructive to the sampl-ing site. Sartz (1967) tested three indirect measurement methods: elec-trical resistance blocks, a penetrometer, {{and a stack of}} buried water bottles. The older literature records yet other devices for indirect frost measure-ment, the most successful of which employed water-filled capillary tubes buried in the soil (Guilleux and Thellier 1947). A method was needed to combine the ease of indirect measurement an...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{managing}} storm water with porous or dense graded asphalt pavement {{has been done}} successfully in Minnesota since 2005, and nationally since the 1970 ’s to provide a solution to storm water runoff and groundwater table recharge. Asphalt pavements {{have been used in}} various climate conditions with the benefits of providing runoff control, aquifer recharge, reduction of drainage structures needed to comply with storm water regulations, and increased skid resistance and safety. The most common locations for use include parking lots and low volume roads, and in high activity recreational areas like basketball and tennis courts or playground lots. Pavement design is also available for heavier load facilities. As shown in Figure 1, a typical pavement section consists of either a porous or a dense graded asphalt pavement layer on top of a choker course layer, a reservoir course (designed for runoff detention <b>frost</b> <b>penetration,</b> and structural capacity), and an non-woven geotextile over the existing soil or subgrade material...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{processes}} involved in and consequences of sub-zero temperatures on the soil parameters relevant to landfill liners. The main points discussed in this paper are examination of published investigations and theories, determination of the changing material properties by in-situ laboratory experiments, experimental determination of temperature loads in-situ and of influences of real boundary conditions in laboratory tests and possible thermal protection methods. In general a structure will be formed in the material which is characteristic of the matrix of the material and the main influence parameters. The results are a rising moisture content in the frozen zone (in case of cryosuction), a lower dry density (loosening by ice lenses) and normally a lower shear capacity. The permeability measured in a triaxcell of the thawed material is raised within the factor of five - in extreme cases within the factor of ten. On the whole the changes measured in-situ are smaller than those measured in the laboratory. The changes are partly reversible by loading, but the structure created by frost will remain latent. One of the essential influences on soil parameters and reversibility {{is represented by the}} mineralogy of the material. <b>Frost</b> <b>penetration</b> in the clay liner below a drain layer of about 40 cm (gavel d = 16 / 32) could not be measured during two winter periods with normal to light weather conditions. Following a <b>frost</b> <b>penetration,</b> landfill liners covered with a plastic sealing strip alone or a plastic sealing strip and a geotextile showed only slight changes in dry density and moisture content. Changes in permeability were even less marked. For uncovered landfill liners alternating cycles of rain, frost and drying resulted in noticeable changes in dry density, moisture content and soil structure. In conclusion {{it can be said that}} this paper discusses some materials with regard to their suitability as a thermal protection for landfill mineral liners. In addition, a flow chart for work on frost-related problems within compacted-clay landfill liners is proposed. (orig.)

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{a description of}} the periglacial environment and features in the vicinity of Tiffindell Ski resort, on the slopes of Ben MacDhui (3001. 2 m.), the highest point of the East Cape Drakensberg, South Africa. Active and inactive periglacial features were located, mapped and described. Of particular interest were periglaciar slope deposits including gelifluction turf-banked lobes and stone lobes, and cryoturbation features including polygons and thufur. Local environmental factors, such as aspect, moisture, topography, soil texture and depth of freezing, appear to act as important controls on the spatial distribution of the periglacial features. Identification and quantification of periglacial processes in the regolith was investigated using temperature and soil moisture sensors coupled to dataloggers. Research was undertaken over a 16 month period from June 1995 to September 1996 so that comparisons between the winter conditions of 1995 and 1996 could be drawn. The Tiffindell area was observed to be characterised in the winter months by 'diurnal freezethaw days', as well as by 'ice days', 1996 experiencing colder temperatures than 1995. With more than 78 % of the days from May to September 1996 being 'ice days', and simultaneously experiencing high soil moisture contents, freezing penetration to a depth of greater than 0. 2 m was observed to occur in the Tiffindell area, causing frost heave and gelifluction. The summer thaw of ice lenses that developed in the cold winter months caused surface movement downslope of gelifluction lobes of up to 39 mm over an 18 month period, although movement declined rapidly with depth and was essentially restricted to the uppermost 130 mm of the regolith. Other features such as sorted and non-sorted polygons and thufur were identified and found to be active under the present climatic conditions and depth of <b>frost</b> <b>penetration</b> at Tiffindell. Stone lobes were identified on the south and southeast-facing slopes at Tiffindell, but are apparently inactive under present climatic conditions. Their existence suggests the presence of severe seasonal frost in the past. The implications of the air and ground surface temperatures, and of seasonal <b>frost</b> <b>penetration</b> for the development of Tiffindell Ski resort were considered, and suggestions regarding their economic significance are presented...|$|E
40|$|A {{perpetual}} {{asphalt concrete}} pavement test section was completed along US- 30 in Wayne County, OH, {{as part of}} the Wooster by-pass, in the fall of 2005. This project represents a collaborative effort between the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) and the asphalt concrete paving industry with the purpose of evaluating the performance of these novel pavements. Perpetual asphalt concrete pavements are designed to last more than 50 years without major structural rehabilitation or reconstruction, and needing only periodic surface renewal to remediate distresses confined to the top pavement layer. Seasonal and load response data collection along the perpetual pavement will be useful in validating design assumptions used to determine the pavement buildups and in calibrating mechanistic/empirical analysis codes. This paper describes the development and installation of a comprehensive instrumentation plan to monitor seasonal (environmental) parameters within the pavement structure, prevalent weather conditions and pavement response when subjected to dynamic loads applied by traffic or during Non-Destructive Testing. The seasonal instrumentation is intended to monitor temperature, volumetric moisture content, <b>frost</b> <b>penetration</b> and ground water level...|$|E
