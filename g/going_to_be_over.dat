25|$|Greece had to {{wait for}} the EuroBasket 2001 in order to make its {{comeback}} to the international scene. The team obviously {{was in the middle of}} a transition period, during which young stars Theo Papaloukas, Antonis Fotsis, and Lazaros Papadopoulos were unable to build a highly competitive team right away. Alvertis, coming off a great year with Panathinaikos, and Giorgos Sigalas, had to show to the young generation the road to success. The first game against Italy, the reigning champion, proved that Alvertis was ready to fulfill his role. A buzzer-beating three pointer gave Greece a very impressive 83–82 win. The team, however, had not reached the level of a medal contender yet. The 105–82 loss against Russia in the next game confirmed that. Consequently, in order to reach the quarter finals, Greece's game against rising power Germany appeared to be a difficult task. After leading the game by 22, the Greek team actually collapsed against superstar Dirk Nowitzki and his teammates, giving Germany an 80–75 win. Alvertis averaged 16 points in the tournament, but Greece ended up in ninth place. It was his last opportunity to reach success with the national team as its leader, especially since Greece had not qualified for the 2002 FIBA World Championship. The transition period for the young generation was soon <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>over.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Alfred Richardson was {{entitled}} to retire in 1918 when he had reached pensionable age within the Police Force. He was persuaded by the Halifax Borough Council Watch Committee {{at this time to}} remain in office. In 1938 he informed the Council that he wished to retire, but again he was persuaded to stay in office, as war seemed inevitable. In 1943, when it became apparent that the Second World War was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>over</b> fairly soon he officially gave notice to the Council {{that he was going to}} retire, giving three months notice dated from 13 September 1943. It was noted in the Halifax Police Force Officers and Constables Book, that Alfred Herbert Richardson, [...] "Joined 8th June 1903. Superannuated 31 October 1943." [...] The Watch Committee resolved that in recognition to the service he had given to the Authority, (40years) it granted he may relinquish the post on 31 October 1943. It immediately resolved that subject to Home Office approval the post would be advertised in the press by advertisement. Alfred Richardson took his last police parade in the courtyard of the Police Station in Harrison Rd. on 30 October 1943. He received much praise from the Halifax Special Constabulary and the Town Council in the various speeches made at this time, and in official meetings held before his day of departure. He had made no secret of the fact that he did not approve of women police and in fact none was appointed during his term of office. After his retirement it was nearly a full year before the first woman police officer was appointed at Halifax.|$|E

6000|$|Shelton {{continued}} {{to travel with}} his college friend, and on Wednesday night, four days after joining company, they reached the village of Dowdenhame. All day long the road had lain through pastureland, with thick green hedges and heavily feathered elms. Once or twice they had broken the monotony by a stretch along the towing-path of a canal, which, choked with water-lily plants and shining weeds, brooded sluggishly beside the fields. Nature, {{in one of her}} ironic moods, had cast a grey and iron-hard cloak over all the country's bland luxuriance. From dawn till darkness fell there had been no movement in the steely distant sky; a cold wind ruffed in the hedge-tops, and sent shivers through the branches of the elms. The cattle, dappled, pied, or bay, or white, continued grazing with an air of grumbling at their birthright. In a meadow close to the canal Shelton saw five magpies, and about five o'clock the rain began, a steady, coldly-sneering rain, which Crocker, looking at the sky, declared was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>over</b> in a minute. But it was not over in a minute; they were soon drenched. Shelton was tired, and it annoyed him very much that his companion, who was also tired, should grow more cheerful. His thoughts kept harping upon Ferrand: [...] "This must be something like what he described to me, tramping on and on when you're dead-beat, until you can cadge up supper and a bed." [...] And sulkily he kept on ploughing through the mud with glances at the exasperating Crocker, who had skinned one heel and was limping horribly. It suddenly came home to him that life for three quarters of the world meant physical exhaustion every day, without a possibility of alternative, and that as soon as, for some cause beyond control, they failed thus to exhaust themselves, they were reduced to beg or starve. [...] "And then we, who don't know {{the meaning of the word}} exhaustion, call them 'idle scamps,'" [...] he said aloud.|$|E

We were also recording in mono audio, so I didn't even have another track to play with like the dramas do these days with split track. Basically I relied on my boom swinger to get my sound. We'd done away with the old sync lead by then, thank God, which meant I wasn't joined up to the camera; the boom mic would be connected to my Nagra mixer and would be recorded separately to picture. The clapperboard really did concentrate the minds in those days because it was quite a costly process if you got it wrong. Because the cast were so good, they would see the boom in the corner of their eye and know when it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>over</b> their head — then they would start speaking."
