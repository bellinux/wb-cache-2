500|$|Rendering lead Jessica McMackin {{spoke about}} the use of ray tracing on the film, saying: [...] "In {{addition}} to creating accurate reflections, we used ray tracing to achieve other effects. We were able to use this approach to create accurate shadows, like when there are multiple light sources and {{you want to get a}} feathering of shadows at the edges. Or occlusion, which is the absence of ambient light between two surfaces, like a crease in a shirt. A fourth use is irradiance. An example of this would be if you had a piece of red paper and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a white wall, the light would be colored by the paper and cast a red glow on the wall." [...] Character supervisor Tim Milliron explained that the film uses a ground–locking system that kept the cars firmly planted on the road, saying: [...] "The ground-locking system is one of the things I’m most proud of on this film. In the past, characters have never known about their environment in any way. A simulation pass was required if you wanted to make something like that happen. On Cars, this system is built into the models themselves, and as you move the car around, the vehicle sticks to the ground. It was one of those things that we do at Pixar where we knew going in that it had to be done, but we had no idea how to do it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Along {{with this}} match, several others saw tributes toward Speed. The only other Premier League match played {{that day was}} between Liverpool and Manchester City. Craig Bellamy of Liverpool was {{withdrawn}} from Liverpool's squad by his manager Kenny Dalglish, as he was too affected by the news to play. Bellamy played with Speed for Newcastle United and Wales, where Speed had also been his manager. Dalglish himself had signed Speed for Newcastle, and expressed his sadness at the news, saying that he thought Speed {{was not only a}} great footballer but also a great person. Another of Speed's former teammates, Hugo Viana, also paid tribute to him. Viana, a Portuguese international played alongside Speed at Newcastle from 2002 to 2004. After his team Braga had lost 3–2 to Porto, Viana displayed a shirt reading [...] "Gary Rest in Peace". Gareth Bale, who played for Speed at Wales, also gave Speed a last tribute. After scoring Tottenham's opening goal in a 3–0 win at home to Bolton, Bale took off his left boot and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> reveal the stitched words [...] "RIP Gary Speed".|$|E

60|$|The Count, at this, glanced {{downward}} to {{the straps}} of his pantaloons, and then taking {{hold of the}} end of one of his coat-tails, <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> close <b>to</b> his eyes for some minutes. Letting it fall, at last, his mouth extended itself very gradually from ear to ear; but I do not remember that he said any thing in the way of reply.|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Bolton {{had ceased}} {{to take part in}} the discussion.

60|$|From a {{distance}} he made out Giselle {{sitting in a}} chair tilted back against the end of the house, under the window of the girl's room. She had her embroidery in her hands, and <b>held</b> <b>it</b> well <b>up</b> <b>to</b> her eyes. The tranquillity of that girlish figure exasperated the feeling of perpetual struggle and strife he carried in his breast. He became angry. It seemed to him that she ought to hear the clanking of his fetters--his silver fetters, from afar. And while ashore that day, he had met the doctor with the evil eye, who had looked at him very hard.|$|R

60|$|The man obeyed, {{feeling at}} {{the mass of}} broken bones and flesh.
