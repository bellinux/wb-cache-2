The clerk signs one authentic copy of the bill and inserts the date (in English) on which the assent was notified to the two houses after the title of the act. When an act is published, the signature of the clerk is omitted, as is the Norman French formula, should the endorsement have been made in writing.

50|$|Most block-books {{before about}} 1480 <b>were</b> <b>printed</b> {{on only one}} side of the paper — if they <b>were</b> <b>printed</b> by rubbing it would <b>be</b> {{difficult}} to <b>print</b> on both sides without damaging the first one to <b>be</b> <b>printed.</b> Many <b>were</b> <b>printed</b> with two pages per sheet, producing a book with opening of two printed pages, followed by openings with two blank pages (as earlier in China). The blank pages were then glued together to produce a book looking like a type-printed one.

5|$|The entire {{second floor}} houses the library. It {{contains}} the scriptures of Gyetengpa, Doduipa, Mamtha, Kangyur, Tengyur and Zungdui, {{which have been}} affected due to insect attacks. The collection in the library consists of two printed books of Tengyur (in 25 volumes), which are commentaries on Buddhist teachings; three sets of Kangyur, the translated version of the canons of Buddhist teachings; and Chanjia Sangbhums in five volumes. Of the three sets of Kangyur, two are handwritten and one <b>is</b> <b>printed.</b> The printed sets are in 101 volumes. One handwritten set has 131 volumes and the other 125 volumes; the letters of these 125 books are washed in gold. The religious text, Gyentongpa, has letters washed in gold in all its pages. At some stage, some of the sacred scriptures were lost and the reason was attributed to the monks of the Tsona monastery who used to visit Tawang during winter time. In the past, these monks had demanded that the gilded image of the Buddha be gifted to them. This was not accepted by the Lamas of the Tawang Monastery and as result the Tsona Lamas refused to part {{with some of the}} sacred texts and records of the Tawang Monastery which were with them. They again took away more books in 1951.|$|E
