5|$|Over 200 {{species of}} bird have been {{recorded}} in the area including black guillemot, <b>eider,</b> peregrine falcon and the golden eagle. In 1981 there were 28 ptarmigan on Arran, but in 2009 {{it was reported that}} extensive surveys had been unable to record any. Similarly, the red-billed chough no longer breeds on the island.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-nine {{species of}} fresh water fish are {{recognized}} on the territory of peninsula, including trout, stickleback, northern pike, and European perch. The rivers are an important habitat for the Atlantic salmon, which return from Greenland and the Faroe Islands to spawn in fresh water. As a result of this, a recreational fishery has been developed, {{with a number of}} remote lodges and camps available to host sport-fishermen. The Kandalaksha Nature Reserve, established in 1932 to protect the population of common <b>eider,</b> is organized in thirteen clusters located in the Kandalaksha Gulf of the Kola Peninsula and along the coasts of the Barents Sea.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} Wijdefjorden {{was first used}} by Russian, and later Norwegian, trappers. The cabin at Krosspynten was erected in 1910, {{and two years later}} the cabin at Purpurdalen was built. Trappers {{considered}} the area to have few polar bears but much fox; they could also supplement the catch with common <b>eider.</b> In 1928, a season of trapping gave about 50 Arctic foxes. In 1932, the area's special vegetation was protected, which was assimilated into the national park when it was created. Since the 1980s, trapping has again been taken up, and the Governor of Svalbard has one cabin at Austfjordnes that can be rented for a season of trapping. Of the larger fjords on Svalbard, Wijdefjorden is the least affected by humans.|$|E

5|$|The {{flora and}} fauna of Stroma {{are similar to those}} of the mainland. The island is treeless; its {{vegetation}} consists primarily of grasses, heather and small flowers. Seals are plentiful along its shores and are sometimes found inland during the breeding season. Both grey seals and harbour seals are present, with around 650 grey seal pups being born each year. Otters may also be present, as in other parts of mainland Caithness. The western cliffs are the site of colonies of terns, guillemots, fulmars and <b>eider</b> ducks. The cliffs are designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest within the North Caithness Cliffs Special Protection Area. The waters off Stroma support a number of cetacean species including minke whale, white-beaked dolphin and harbour porpoise.|$|E
5|$|In {{the western}} Mojave Desert, human {{settlement}} and land development {{have led to}} an estimated 16-fold increase in the common raven population over 25 years. Towns, landfills, sewage treatment plants and artificial ponds create sources {{of food and water}} for scavenging birds. Ravens also find nesting sites in utility poles and ornamental trees, and are attracted to roadkill on highways. The explosion in the common raven population in the Mojave has raised concerns for the desert tortoise, a threatened species. Common ravens prey upon juvenile tortoises, which have soft shells and move slowly. Despite this, and there being no danger of extinction, the US Congress added ravens to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 in 1971. Plans to control the population have included shooting and trapping birds, as well as contacting landfill operators to ask that they reduce the amount of exposed garbage. A hunting bounty as a method of control was historically used in Finland from the mid-18th century until 1923. Culling has taken place to a limited extent in Alaska, where the population increase in common ravens is threatening the vulnerable Steller's <b>eider</b> (Polysticta stelleri).|$|E
5|$|The Firth is an {{important}} area for nature conservation and has a range of habitats including extensive mudflats, shingle shorelines and saltmarsh. The last named, which is well developed on Alloa Inch, is typically dominated by saltmarsh rush, sea club-rush, sea aster and common saltmarsh-grass. The inner Firth is important for nationally and internationally important numbers of wintering wildfowl and wading birds and hosts populations of shelduck, knot, redshank, great crested grebe, teal and goldeneye. The outer islands support significant numbers of nesting seabirds. The Bass Rock has more than 150,000 nesting northern gannets and is the largest single rock gannetry in the world. When viewed from the mainland much of the rock looks white due to {{the sheer number of}} birds (and their droppings, which give off 152 tonnes of ammonia per year). The scientific names for this gannet, Sula bassana and Morus bassanus, are derived from the rock. The bird was traditionally known locally as the solan goose, and its eggs and meat were considered delicacies. It is estimated that in 1850 almost 2000 birds were harvested from the rock. Other bird species on the rock include guillemot, razorbill, cormorant, puffin, <b>eider</b> duck and numerous gulls.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eiders</b> are colonial breeders. They nest on coastal {{islands in}} colonies {{ranging in size}} of less than 100 to upwards of 10,000-15,000 individuals. Female <b>eiders</b> {{frequently}} exhibit {{a high degree of}} natal philopatry, where they return to breed on the same island where they were hatched. This can lead to a high degree of relatedness between individuals nesting on the same island, as well as the development of kin-based female social structures. This relatedness has likely {{played a role in the}} evolution of co-operative breeding behaviours amongst <b>eiders.</b> Examples of these behaviours include laying eggs in the nests of related individuals and cr√®ching, where female <b>eiders</b> team up and share the work of rearing ducklings.|$|R
40|$|The winter diet of Spectacled <b>Eiders</b> {{living in}} marine {{habitats}} is known only from two individuals described by Cottam (1939). Here we examine marine diets from 36 stomachs collected near St. Lawrence Island, Bering Sea, Alaska, during May-June in 1987 and 1992. All Spectacled <b>Eiders</b> ate Mollusca, including Gastropoda (snails; {{frequency of occurrence}} 20. 0 %; sole taxon 0. 0 %) and Bivalvia (bivalves; 80. 0 %; 48. 0 %), and Crustacea (barnacles, amphipods and crabs; 30. 6 %; 0. 0 %). One bird ate a cod. The predominant species group eaten was Macoma Clams (72. 0 %; 36. 0 %). Prey species of Spectacled <b>Eiders</b> occur predominantly in waters 25 - 60 m deep in the Bering Sea. To obtain these prey, especially the bivalves, on the winter area Spectacled <b>Eiders</b> must forage in waters exceeding 40 m. We speculate that Spectacled <b>Eiders</b> regularly forage at depths of 45 - 70 m throughout winte...|$|R

5|$|The Little Ice Age {{may have}} reduced the {{population}} of the great auk by exposing more of their breeding islands to predation by polar bears, but massive exploitation by humans for their down drastically reduced the population. By the mid-sixteenth century, the nesting colonies along the European side of the Atlantic were nearly all eliminated by humans killing this bird for its down, which was used to make pillows. In 1553, the great auk received its first official protection, and in 1794 Great Britain banned the killing of this species for its feathers. In St. John's, those violating a 1775 law banning hunting the great auk for its feathers or eggs were publicly flogged, though hunting for use as fishing bait was still permitted. On the North American side, <b>eider</b> down initially was preferred, but once the eiders were nearly driven to extinction in the 1770s, down collectors switched to the great auk {{at the same time that}} hunting for food, fishing bait, and oil decreased.|$|E
5|$|The tundra is a sub-Arctic zone with long, cold winters and short, warm summers. Precipitation is low. Soil a meter {{below ground}} and deeper is {{permanently}} frozen (permafrost), {{which does not}} allow water to drain easily through the soil, so it collects in shallow pools. Trees and shrubs are stunted since their roots cannot grow into the permafrost. Low shrubs, lichens, mosses, and small herbaceous plants are found instead. The most common mammals on the tundra are the barren-ground caribou, Arctic wolf, Arctic fox, Arctic hare, lemmings, and voles. Occasional sightings of muskoxen have been made near Cape Chidley, Labrador's most northerly point. The polar bear is the dominant carnivore of the tundra, but is an occasional visitor to coastal Newfoundland, especially in the spring. Many birds migrate to Labrador in spring to lay their eggs and raise their young before returning south for the winter, including the common <b>eider,</b> harlequin duck, Common redpoll and American pipit. The Labrador tundra is also permanent home to ptarmigan.|$|E

The capricious change in style from one album to the next remains a Deerhoof hallmark. Cover art was by Fisk. From 1997 to 1999, Deerhoof had toured the U.S. with Sleater-Kinney, Lightning Bolt, Unwound, and Sonic Youth. But in fall 1999, with both albums and various singles selling poorly, Fisk and Goode quit.
