5|$|Aside {{from the}} rare solid-colored horse (usually bay or black), most Lipizzans are gray. Like all gray horses, they have black skin, dark eyes, and as adult horses, a white hair coat. Gray horses, {{including}} Lipizzans, are born darkusually bay or blackand become lighter each {{year as the}} <b>graying</b> process takes place, with the process being complete at between 6 and 10 years of age. Lipizzans are not actually true white horses, {{but this is a}} common misconception. A white horse is born white and has unpigmented skin.|$|E
25|$|Cells {{from people}} with A-T {{demonstrate}} genomic instability, slow growth and premature senescence in culture, shortened telomeres and an ongoing, low-level stress response. These factors {{may contribute to}} the progeric (signs of early aging) changes of skin and hair sometimes observed in people with A-T. For example, DNA damage and genomic instability cause melanocyte stem cell (MSC) differentiation which produces <b>graying.</b> Thus, ATM may be a “stemness checkpoint” protecting against MSC differentiation and premature <b>graying</b> of the hair.|$|E

25|$|A-T {{can cause}} {{features}} of early aging such as premature <b>graying</b> of the hair.

25|$|Low {{levels of}} {{catalase}} {{may play a}} role in the <b>graying</b> process of human hair. Hydrogen peroxide is naturally produced by the body and broken down by catalase.

500|$|Many {{genes that}} create horse coat colors and {{patterns}} have been identified. Current genetic tests can identify at least 13 different alleles influencing coat color, and research continues to discover new genes linked to specific traits. The basic coat colors of chestnut and black {{are determined by}} the gene controlled by the Melanocortin 1 receptor, also known as the [...] "extension gene" [...] or [...] "red factor," [...] as its recessive form is [...] "red" [...] (chestnut) and its dominant form is black. [...] Additional genes control suppression of black color to point coloration that results in a bay, spotting patterns such as pinto or leopard, dilution genes such as palomino or dun, as well as <b>graying,</b> and all the other factors that create the many possible coat colors found in horses.|$|E

[...] In his review for The Wire, Derek Walmsley wrote positively about the album. He said that [...] "Syro feels like a perfected memory of 80s music", adding [...] "its sweeping melodies, with echoes of 1991's Analogue Bubblebath, {{could be seen as}} a return to his roots" [...] but concluded that [...] "Aphex Twin's music seems as new as it ever was." [...] Rolling Stone reviewer Will Hermes gave Syro a four-out-of-five star rating and stated that the record is [...] "thick with Seventies jazz-funk nods" [...] and [...] "answers Daft Punks Random Access Memories with future-shock electronics supplanting nostalgic dazzle … <b>graying</b> snobs once called this 'intelligent dance music.'

500|$|Paul {{arrived in}} North Florida for a {{campaign}} event in early January 1988, with ten months still remaining until the election. The event was chronicled by a journalist for the Ocala Star-Banner, who compared Paul to a kamikaze and remarked that he never gives up even though his [...] "chance of becoming president" [...] was no greater than that for the journalist himself. Paul was described as [...] "slim, attractive, <b>graying,</b> immaculately attired and most articulate," [...] but as a candidate who was dismissed by the media for his political positions such as support of the decriminalization of hard drugs. Paul visited the University of Florida during his trip, and gave a campaign speech in front of 200 students in the auditorium in Turlington Hall. Later in the month, he left Florida and campaigned in Iowa, where he spoke at Drake University and the University of Iowa.

500|$|Ramones was {{released}} on April 23, 1976 by Sire Records and received glowing reviews. In May, John Rockwell of the New York Times published a rave review, saying: [...] "What the Ramones do is deliver a nonstop set of short, brisk, monochromatically intense songs. [...] conventional considerations of pace and variety are thrown calculatedly to the winds. The ingredients are simplicity itself." [...] Rockwell noted: [...] "the effect in the end amounts to an abstraction of rock so pure that other associations get left behind." [...] Nick Kent favourably commented in the NME: [...] "This record poses {{a direct threat to}} any vaguely sensitive woofer and/or tweeter lodged in your hi-fi...". Critic Robert Christgau in The Village Voice gave the album a positive review, specifically writing about the album's themes and sound quality. In July, Paul Nelson of Rolling Stone wrote in 1976 that the album was similar to early rock and roll, and was constructed using rhythm tracks of great intensity. In August, Creem dubbed The Ramones as [...] "The most radical album of the past six years", saying: [...] " [...] is so strikingly different, so brazenly out of touch with prevailing modes as to constitute a bold swipe at the status quo." [...] Reviewer Gene Sculatti saw it as [...] "a rock 'n' roll reactionary's manifesto" [...] "a sharp wedge between the stale ends of a contemporary music scene bloated with <b>graying</b> superstars and overripe for takeover." [...] Critic Joe S. Harrington declared that the album was a huge landmark for music history, proclaiming that [...] " [...] split the history of rock 'n' roll in half." [...] Theunis Bates, a writer for Time, summed the album up with: [...] "Ramones stripped rock back to its basic elements... lyrics are very simple, boiled-down declarations of teen lust and need." [...] Bates also said that it [...] "is the ultimate punk statement." [...] Charles M. Young of Rolling Stone regarded Ramones as [...] "one of the funniest rock records ever made and, if punk continues to gain momentum, a historic turning point." ...|$|E

Genetic testing is now possible to determine whether a horse is homozygous or heterozygous for <b>gray,</b> or if it does not carry the gene at all.
