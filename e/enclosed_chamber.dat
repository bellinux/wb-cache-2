500|$|Fruit bodies first {{appear as}} tiny white knobs {{less than a}} cubic {{millimeter}} in size. In {{a day or two}} the knobs grow into a horizontal pyramidal mass, increasing in height as the hyphae lengthen. This is soon followed by the formation of a minute cap, and lengthening of the stem. The stem is about 1mm long when the cap first begins to form. The hyphae that comprise the stem gradually cease to grow at their ends, and then start to branch, with many of the branches growing in a horizontal direction. This growth, indicated by the flattening and broadening out of the top of the stem, gives rise to the cap. The horizontally aligned hyphae grow vertical branches which remain more or less parallel, ultimately forming the dorsal tissue of the cap. Other similar downward-growing branches form the fertile hymenium, which can be seen when the cap is about 2mm in diameter.The young cap is spherical and its growth is at first , its margin being curved inwards and pressed against the stem. In this way, the hymenium begins its development within a special <b>enclosed</b> <b>chamber.</b> As the hymenial surface increases and keeps pace with the growth of the dorsal tissue of the cap, the latter expands and exposes the gills. The gills are formed by the continual downward growth of some of the hyphae. The gills are exposed before the cap is completely developed, and before the spores are mature. Spores can be produced by fruit bodies as small as [...] broad, and liberation of the spores continues until the fruit body is fully grown—a period of one month to three months, depending on the conditions of temperature and moisture. The mature spores are disseminated by the wind. When the fruit body is nearing maturity, some of the terminal portions of the hyphae of the dorsal surface of the cap separate, and as a consequence, the upper surface of the fruit body becomes granular in appearance.|$|E

Such an incident followed the Trimdon Grange explosion which killed men in the Kelloe mine.|$|R

25|$|Trogons are cavity nesters. Nests are {{dug into}} rotting wood or termite nests, with one species, the violaceous trogon, nesting in wasp nests. Nest {{cavities}} {{can either be}} deep upward slanting tubes that lead to fully <b>enclosed</b> <b>chambers,</b> or much shallower open niches (from which the bird is visible). Nests are dug with the beak, incidentally giving the family its name. Nest digging may be undertaken by the male alone or by both sexes. In the case of nests dug into tree trunks, the wood must be strong enough not to collapse but soft enough to dig out. Trogons have been observed landing on dead tree trunks and slapping the wood with their tails, presumably to test the firmness.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{presents a}} study of cell-based Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS) sensors employed for testing toxicants in real-time. Mammalian cells are exposed to toxicants and information about cell viability are obtained from impedance measurements. The toxicants used are nicotine, phenol, ammonia and aldicarb. Two different adherent mammalian cells lines and cell culturewares were used to optimize the toxicity study. The cell lines {{used in this study}} were: bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) and rat fat pad endothelial cells (RFPEC). The BAECs generated higher impedance values and formed cell monolayers at a faster rate compared to RFPECs. The two cell culturewares used in this study were simple open cell-culture wells and enclosed cell culturewares with microfluidic perfusion barriers. Experimental results indicated that the open wells are not suited for toxicity experiments. The turbulent flow created by pipetting media and toxicants in open cell culture wells disrupts the formation of the cell monolayer. When <b>enclosed</b> culture <b>chambers</b> were used, the flow of the cell culture medium and toxicant solutions were laminar on the cell monolayer. Both finite element simulations and experimental results showed that <b>enclosed</b> perfusion <b>chamber</b> have better performance due to the laminar flow of the solutions. The <b>enclosed</b> perfusion <b>chamber</b> also significantly shortens the response time of the cells when exposed to toxicants compared to the open cell culture wells. The experimental results demonstrated that ECIS biosensors seeded with BAECs inside <b>enclosed</b> cell culture <b>chambers</b> successfully assesses the effect of toxicants on mammalian cells in real-time...|$|R

5000|$|In gauges {{intended}} to sense small pressures or pressure differences, or require that an absolute pressure be measured, the gear train and needle may {{be driven by}} an enclosed and sealed bellows chamber, called an aneroid, which means [...] "without liquid". (Early barometers used a column of liquid such as water or the liquid metal mercury suspended by a vacuum.) This bellows configuration is used in aneroid barometers (barometers with an indicating needle and dial card), altimeters, altitude recording barographs, and the altitude telemetry instruments used in weather balloon radiosondes. These devices use the sealed chamber as a reference pressure and are driven by the external pressure. Other sensitive aircraft instruments such as air speed indicators and rate of climb indicators (variometers) have connections both to the internal part of the aneroid chamber and to an external <b>enclosing</b> <b>chamber.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{altitude}} {{facility is}} much more complex than a sea level facility. The rocket is installed inside an <b>enclosed</b> <b>chamber</b> which is evacuated to a minimum pressure level before rocket firing. A typical chamber operating pressure of 0.16 psia (equivalent to an altitude of 100,000 feet) is established inside the chamber by some form of mechanical pumping. Mechanical pumping is typically provided by steam ejector/diffusers. If the products of combustion from the rocket firing include flammable or explosive materials, the chamber must be inerted, typically with gaseous nitrogen (GN2). The inerting process prevents build-up of potentially explosive materials inside the chamber or exhaust ducting.|$|E

He had been assigned the task of producing a car with both qualities. He realized that the solution must be located in a variable suspension, one that is very flexible at low speed, and stiff at high speed and load.This questioning led to experimentation and the eventual development of hydro-pneumatic suspension system, which combines easily compressible gas in an <b>enclosed</b> <b>chamber,</b> combined with the non-compressible, force multiplication properties of hydraulic machinery.The heavier the load, the higher the gas pressure, so the suspension becomes more rigid.
