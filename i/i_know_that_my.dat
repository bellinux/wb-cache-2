500|$|In the {{conventional}} sense, Cardus {{was not a}} religious man; Dennis Silk, a one-time MCC president, suggests that Cardus's religion was [...] "friendship". In Autobiography Cardus says he found his Kingdom of Heaven in the arts, [...] "the only religion that is real and, once found, omnipresent"—though his rationalism was shaken, he confesses, {{when he came to}} understand the late string quartets of Beethoven. He ends his autobiography by declaring: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> Redeemer liveth it is not on the church's testimony, but because of what Handel affirms".|$|E
500|$|Another {{source of}} {{criticism}} by the Liberals involved PedroI's abolitionist views. The Emperor had indeed conceived a gradual process for eliminating slavery. However, the constitutional power to enact legislation {{was in the}} hands of the Assembly, which was dominated by slave-owning landholders who could thus thwart any attempt at abolition. The Emperor opted to try persuasion by moral example, setting up his estate at Santa Cruz as a model by granting land to his freed slaves there. PedroI also professed other advanced ideas. When he declared his intention to remain in Brazil on 9 January 1822 and the populace sought to accord him the honor of unhitching the horses and pulling his carriage themselves, the then-Prince Regent refused. His reply was a simultaneous denunciation of the divine right of kings, of nobility's supposedly superior blood and of racism: [...] "It grieves me to see my fellow humans giving a man tributes appropriate for the divinity, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> blood is the same color as that of the Negroes." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{realize that}} I shouldn't be {{surprised}} at God's doing things that I can't explain. [...] I shouldn't doubt His existence just because I find that I sometimes can't understand why or how He has made something. [...] <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> nature is weak and limited and that God's is limitless, incomprehensible, and infinite, and, from this, I can infer that He can do innumerable things whose reasons are unknown to me. [...] On this ground alone, I regard the common practice of explaining things {{in terms of their}} purposes to be useless in physics: it would be foolhardy of me to think that I can discover God's purposes.

2500|$|..... I {{was sentenced}} {{for the crime}} of {{collaboration}} with terrorism, and I did collaborate with the MRTA. I have never been a leader, nor a militant.

I was in prison for almost 15 years. I have reflected a great deal over it, and I understand that violence did harm to society; I understand it and I regret that I participated in it.

2500|$|On 3 May 2013 Ecaterina Andronescu, former Minister of Education, professor, {{and member}} of the Social Democratic Party (Romania) {{declared}} in an interview when questioned about legalizing [...] same-sex marriage the following: [...] "You know, to answer this questions it's necessary to give a more extended commentary. On one hand I respect human rights, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> freedoms ends where I am interfering with yours, {{but at the same time}} each of us has a mission on this earth, we must ensure future generations and this occurs naturally by marriage between men and women. If we go further we would understand that at some point humanity will come to an end if same-sex marriage is proliferated too extensively. That's why I, personally don't believe this is a solution, although I do agree that I must respect each individual's answer to the question [...] "What will he do with his life" [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|The funeral {{took place}} on Wednesday 16 October 1940 at [...] in Brunswick Square, Herne Bay, Kent. The Reverend A.W. Parry Williams officiated {{in the church and}} at the committal by the graveside; there was a surpliced choir at the church service, and the organ played <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> Redeemer liveth from Handel's Messiah as the coffin was borne into the church. There were many mourners {{including}} the Sultan at the church and cemetery, and a large number of floral tributes. The Sultan's wreath was [...] "laid in the grave with the coffin". The interment was at Herne Bay Cemetery at Eddington. [...] In plot BBR46 at {{the eastern edge of the}} cemetery is an elaborate, marble monument to her; it is blue and white like her house. It was paid for by the Sultan and adorned with a standing Saxon-style cross, a marble floor with an engraved poem and an iron fence. The inscription says: [...] "In loving memory of Lydia Cecily Hill; born 20th July 1913; died 11th October 1940. [...] This monument has been erected by a devoted friend. Somewhere back of the sunset / Where loveliness never dies / She dwells in the land of glory/ 'Neath the blue and gold of the skies / And we who have lived with and loved her / Whose passing has caused us tears / Will cherish her memory for ever / Down through the passing years." ...|$|E
