40|$|Abstract. From {{anaerobic}} enrichments with 2, 3 -butanediol as sole substrate pure {{cultures of}} new Gram-negative, strictly anaerobic, non-sporeforming bacteria were isolated. Similar isolates were obtained with acetoin as substrate. From marine muds in saltwater medium a short rod (strain <b>Gra</b> <b>Bd</b> 1) was isolated which fermented butanediol, acetoin and ethylene glycol to acetate and ethanol. The DNA base ratio of this strain was 52. 3 mol % guanine plus cytosine. From freshwater sediments and sewage sludge, {{a different type}} of short rod (strain Ott Bd 1) was isolated in freshwater medium, which fermented butanediol, acetoin, ethanol, lac-tate and pyrnvate stoichiometrically to acetate and pro-pionate. Propanol and butanol were oxidized to the respective fatty acids with concomitant reduction of acetate and bicar-bonate to propionate. The DNA base ratio of strain Ott Bd 1 was 57. 4 mo 1 ~ guanine plus cytosine, No other substrates were used by the isolates, and no other products could be detected. In cocultures with Acetobacterium woodii or Methanospirillum hungatei, strain <b>Gra</b> <b>Bd</b> I also grew on ethanol, propanol, and butanol by fermenting these alcohols to the respective fatty acids and molecular hydrogen. Cytochromes could not be detected in any of the new isolates. Since both types of bacteria can not be affiliated to any of the existing genera and species, the new species Pelobacter carbinolicus and Pelobacter propionicus are proposed. The mechanism of butanediol degradation andpropionate for-mation from acetate as well as the ecological importance of both processes are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Cytolytic granule-mediated {{target cell}} killing is {{effected}} {{in part through}} synergistic action of the membrane-acting protein perforin and serine proteases such as granzymes A (<b>GrA)</b> <b>or</b> <b>B</b> (GrB). In the present study we examine GrA cellular entry and nuclear uptake in intact mouse myeloid FDC-P 1 cells exposed to perforin using confocal laser scanning microscopy, as well as reconstitute GrA nuclear uptake in vitro. GrA alone {{was found to be}} able to enter the cytoplasm of intact cells but did not accumulate in nuclei. In the presence of perforin, it specifically accumulated in the cell nuclei, with maximal levels about 2. 5 times those in the cytoplasm after 2. 5 hours. In vitro, GrA accumulated in the nucleus and nucleolus maximally to levels that were four- and sixfold, respectively, those in the cytoplasm. In contrast, the active form of the apoptotic cysteine protease CPP 32 did not accumulate in nuclei in vitro. Nuclear/nucleolar import of GrA in vitro was independent of ATP and not inhibitable by the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog GTPgammaS, but was dependent on exogenously added cytosol. Importantly, GrA was found to be able to accumulate in the nucleus of semi-intact cells {{in the presence of the}} nuclear envelope-permeabilizing detergent CHAPS, implying that the mechanism of nuclear accumulation was through binding to insoluble factors in the nucleus. GrB was found for the first time to be similar in this regard. The results support the contention that GrA and GrB accumulate in the nucleus through a novel nuclear import pathway, and that this is integral to induction of the nuclear changes associated with cytolytic granule-mediated apoptosis.

40|$|Pulmonary {{metastasis}} can {{be present}} in as frequently as 88 % and 80 %, respectively, of patients with sarcoma and germ cell tumour with metastatic disease. In both sarcoma and germ cell tumour, pulmonary metastatectomy {{may be the only}} means of rendering a patient disease-free. Sublobar (wedge or segmentectomy), lobectomy, and, rarely, pneumonectomy can be safely performed to achieve complete resection. Bilateral disease can be resected via staged thoracoscopy/thoracotomy, median sternotomy, <b>or</b> <b>clamshell</b> thoracotomy. Finally, multiple resections and re-resections in select patients have resulted in improved survival. The main principle of pulmonary metastatectomy is complete resection. In the appropriately selected patient 5 -yr survival rates of as high as 35 - 52 % for sarcoma, and 80 % for germ cell tumour can be realized...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{observation}} of three-mode optoacoustic parametric interactions of the type predicted to cause parametric instabilities in a 77 -m-long, high-optical-power cavity that uses suspended sapphire mirrors. Resonant interaction occurs between two distinct optical modes and an acoustic mode of one mirror when the difference in frequency between the two optical cavity modes {{is close to the}} frequency of the acoustic mode. Experimental results validate the theory of parametric instability in high-power optical cavities, and demonstrate tunable parametric gain ∼ 10 − 2 and more than 20 dB amplification of a high-order optical mode power generated by an applied acoustic signalC.

40|$|We {{present a}} case of 16 -year-old male, who was {{referred}} from private centre for dyspnoea, fatigue, and orthopnea. The chest radiograph revealed complete opacification of left chest which was confirmed by computed tomography as a large left mediastinal mass measuring 14 × 15 × 18 [*]cm. The diagnostic needle core biopsy revealed mixed germ cell tumour with possible combination of embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac, and teratoma. After 4 cycles of neoadjuvant BEP regime, there was initial response of tumour markers but not tumour bulk. Instead of classic median sternotomy <b>or</b> <b>clamshell</b> incision, posterolateral approach with piecemeal manner was chosen. Histology confirmed mixed germ cell tumour with residual teratomatous component without yolk sac or embryonal carcinoma component.

40|$|Cancer {{accounts}} {{as one of}} {{the leading}} causes of morbidity and mortality. Recent studies focus on the efficiency of phytochemicals in cancer therapy. Influence of quercetin, a flavonoid on the effect of γδ T cells and Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway in human colon cancer cells (HT 55 and HCT 116) was investigated. Quercetin at 15 - 120 µM was observed to markedly reduce the viability of HT 55 and HCT 116 cells. Quercetin exposure significantly increased γδ T cell proliferation and also raised the expressions of granzyme <b>B</b> (<b>Gra</b> <b>B),</b> perforin (PFP), and interferon- γ (IFN-γ) in γδ T cells. Reduced β-catenin expression with increased expressions of phosphorylated- β-catenin, axin 1 and 2 were observed in HT 55 and HCT 116 cells on exposure to quercetin. However β-actin expression was found to be not much altered. The results suggest that quercetin was able to efficiently potentiate the effect of γδ T cells and modulate Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway...|$|R
