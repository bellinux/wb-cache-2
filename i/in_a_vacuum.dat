5|$|His {{early works}} in dynamics, {{the science of}} motion and {{mechanics}} were his circa 1590 Pisan De Motu (On Motion) and his circa 1600 Paduan Le Meccaniche (Mechanics). The former was based on Aristotelian–Archimedean fluid dynamics and held that the speed of gravitational fall in a fluid medium was proportional to the excess of a body's specific weight over that of the medium, whereby <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum,</b> bodies would fall with speeds in proportion to their specific weights. It also subscribed to the Philoponan impetus dynamics in which impetus is self-dissipating and free-fall <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> would have an essential terminal speed according to specific weight after an initial period of acceleration.|$|E
5|$|Another notable {{feature of}} Tolkien's Elvish {{languages}} was his {{development of a}} complex internal history of characters to speak those tongues in their own fictional universe. He felt that his languages changed and developed over time, as with the historical languages which he studied professionally—not <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum,</b> {{but as a result}} of the migrations and interactions of the peoples who spoke them.|$|E
5|$|In his 1638 Discorsi, Galileo's {{character}} Salviati, {{widely regarded}} as Galileo's spokesman, held that all unequal weights would fall with the same finite speed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum.</b> But this had previously been proposed by Lucretius and Simon Stevin. Cristiano Banti's Salviati also held it could be experimentally demonstrated by the comparison of pendulum motions in air with bobs of lead and of cork which had different weight but which were otherwise similar.|$|E

5|$|Metallic {{plutonium}} {{is produced}} by reacting plutonium tetrafluoride with barium, calcium or lithium at 1200°C. It is attacked by acids, oxygen, and steam but not by alkalis and dissolves easily in concentrated hydrochloric, hydroiodic and perchloric acids. Molten metal must be kept <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> or an inert atmosphere to avoid reaction with air. At 135°C the metal will ignite in air and will explode if placed in carbon tetrachloride.|$|E
5|$|Neon is the second-lightest noble gas, after helium. It glows reddish-orange <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> {{discharge}} tube. Also, neon has {{the narrowest}} liquid range of any element: from 24.55 K to 27.05 K (−248.45°C to −245.95°C, or −415.21°F to −410.71°F). It has over 40 times the refrigerating capacity of liquid helium {{and three times}} that of liquid hydrogen (on a per unit volume basis). In most applications it is a less expensive refrigerant than helium.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium {{reacts with}} {{hydrogen}} {{in a similar}} manner to its neighbor plutonium, forming the hydrides NpH2+x (face-centered cubic) and NpH3 (hexagonal). These are isostructural with the corresponding plutonium hydrides, although unlike PuH2+x, the lattice parameters of NpH2+x become greater as the hydrogen content (x) increases. The hydrides require extreme care in handling as they decompose <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> at 300°C to form finely divided neptunium metal, which is pyrophoric.|$|E

5|$|Three {{neptunium}} arsenide compounds {{have been}} prepared, NpAs, NpAs2, and Np3As4. The first two were first created by heating arsenic and neptunium hydride in a vacuum-sealed tube {{for about a}} week. Later, NpAs was also made by confining neptunium metal and arsenic <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> tube, separating them with a quartz membrane, and heating them to just below neptunium's melting point of 639°C, which is slightly higher than the arsenic's sublimation point of 615°C. Np3As4 is prepared by a similar procedure using iodine as a transporting agent. NpAs2 crystals are brownish gold and Np3As4 is black. The neptunium antimonide compound NpSb was created in 1971 by placing equal quantities of both elements <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> tube, heating them to the melting point of antimony, and then heating it further to 1000°C for sixteen days. This procedure also created trace amounts of an additional antimonide compound Np3Sb4. One neptunium-bismuth compound, NpBi, has also been reported.|$|E
5|$|According to Einstein's {{theory of}} special relativity, as an electron's speed {{approaches}} {{the speed of}} light, from an observer's point of view its relativistic mass increases, thereby making it {{more and more difficult}} to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. The speed of an electron can approach, but never reach, the speed of light <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum,</b> c. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons moving at a speed close to c—are injected into a dielectric medium such as water, where the local speed of light is significantly less than c, the electrons temporarily travel faster than light in the medium. As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint light called Cherenkov radiation.|$|E
5|$|Atmospheric {{passivation}} gives titanium excellent {{resistance to}} corrosion, almost equivalent to platinum. Titanium {{is capable of}} withstanding attack by dilute sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, chloride solutions, and most organic acids. However, titanium is corroded by concentrated acids. As indicated by its negative redox potential, titanium is thermodynamically a very reactive metal that burns in normal atmosphere at lower temperatures than the melting point. Melting is possible only in an inert atmosphere or <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum.</b> At , it combines with chlorine. It also reacts with the other halogens and absorbs hydrogen.|$|E

5|$|Bromine oxides {{are not as}} {{well-characterised}} as {{chlorine oxides}} or iodine oxides, as they are all fairly unstable: it was once thought {{that they could not}} exist at all. Dibromine monoxide is a dark-brown solid which, while reasonably stable at −60°C, decomposes at its melting point of −17.5°C; it is useful in bromination reactions and may be made from the low-temperature decomposition of bromine dioxide <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum.</b> It oxidises iodine to iodine pentoxide and benzene to 1,4-benzoquinone; in alkaline solutions, it gives the hypobromite anion.|$|E
5|$|Its usual {{commercial}} form is a powder, but this element can be consolidated by pressing and sintering <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> or hydrogen atmosphere. This procedure yields a compact solid having a density above 90% of {{the density of}} the metal. When annealed this metal is very ductile and can be bent, coiled, or rolled. Rhenium-molybdenum alloys are superconductive at 10 K; tungsten-rhenium alloys are also superconductive around 4–8 K, depending on the alloy. Rhenium metal superconducts at 1.697 ± 0.006 K.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} a Universe filled with a luminiferous aether {{remained}} in vogue among some scientists until the early 20th century. This form of aether was viewed as the medium through which light could propagate. In 1887, the Michelson–Morley experiment tried to detect the Earth's motion through this medium by looking {{for changes in the}} speed of light depending on the direction of the planet's motion. However, the null result indicated something was wrong with the concept. The idea of the luminiferous aether was then abandoned. It was replaced by Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, which holds that the speed of light <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> is a fixed constant, independent of the observer's motion or frame of reference.|$|E

40|$|The present studies {{tested a}} {{proposed}} model that outlines {{the consequences of}} unconsciously activated behavior on affect and cognition. The model proposes that acting <b>in</b> <b>an</b> explanatory <b>vacuum</b> (i. e. when no explanation can be given for one’s own behavior due to unconscious activation), gives rise to negative affect, which in turn triggers people to confabulate (i. e. making up other plausible, but erroneous, reasons for one’s behavior). Moreover, the model predicts that, for negative affect and confabulation to arise spontaneously, behavior has to be norm-violating. Study 1 was designed to test whether acting <b>in</b> <b>an</b> explanatory <b>vacuum</b> can lead to negative affect and confabulation, when asked to explain one’s behavior. Study 2 was designed to test the entire theoretical model by determining whether, {{as a result of}} acting <b>in</b> <b>an</b> explanatory <b>vacuum,</b> confabulation can arise spontaneously and whether this is mediated by negative affect and/or moderated by norms. The results showed that confabulation can arise <b>in</b> both <b>a</b> provoked and spontaneous manner and that the effect of acting <b>in</b> <b>an</b> explanatory <b>vacuum</b> on confabulation is mediated by negative affect. Confabulation only occurs spontaneously following norm-violating behavior...|$|R
5|$|Beryllium {{was used}} by the Manhattan Project as a neutron reflector, and as a {{component}} of modulated neutron initiators. Only one firm produced it commercially in the United States, Brush Beryllium in Lorain, Ohio. The Ames Project began working on a production process in December 1943, reducing beryllium fluoride in a bomb with metallic magnesium and a sulphur booster. The main difficulty with working with beryllium was its high toxicity. A closed bomb was used to minimize the possibility of producing toxic beryllium dust. The process worked, but the high temperatures and pressures created by the magnesium sulphide meant that it was potentially explosive. An alternative was then developed using beryllium fluoride in a bomb with metallic calcium and a lead chloride booster. The metal was cast <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum.</b> Research was still ongoing when the war ended.|$|E
5|$|Energy {{beam welding}} methods, namely {{laser beam welding}} and {{electron}} beam welding, are relatively new processes that have become quite popular in high production applications. The two processes are quite similar, differing most notably in their source of power. Laser beam welding employs a highly focused laser beam, while electron beam welding is done <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> and uses an electron beam. Both {{have a very high}} energy density, making deep weld penetration possible and minimizing the size of the weld area. Both processes are extremely fast, and are easily automated, making them highly productive. The primary disadvantages are their very high equipment costs (though these are decreasing) and a susceptibility to thermal cracking. Developments in this area include laser-hybrid welding, which uses principles from both laser beam welding and arc welding for even better weld properties, laser cladding, and x-ray welding.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium nitride (NpN) {{was first}} {{prepared}} in 1953 by reacting neptunium hydride and ammonia gas at around 750°C in a quartz capillary tube. Later, it {{was produced by}} reacting different mixtures of nitrogen and hydrogen with neptunium metal at various temperatures. It has also been created by the reduction of neptunium dioxide with diatomic nitrogen gas at 1550°C. NpN is isomorphous with uranium mononitride (UN) and plutonium mononitride (PuN) and has a melting point of 2830°C under a nitrogen pressure of around 1 MPa. Two neptunium phosphide compounds have been reported, NpP and Np3P4. The first has a face centered cubic structure and is prepared by converting neptunium metal to a powder and then reacting it with phosphine gas at 350°C. Np3P4 can be created by reacting neptunium metal with red phosphorus at 740°C <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> and then allowing any extra phosphorus to sublimate away. The compound is non-reactive with water but will react with nitric acid to produce Np(IV) solution.|$|E
40|$|Generic heterotic M-theory compactifications contain five-branes {{wrapping}} non-isolated genus zero {{or higher}} genus curves <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Calabi-Yau threefold. Non-perturbative superpotentials do {{not depend on}} moduli of such five-branes. We show that fluxes and non-perturbative effects can stabilize them <b>in</b> <b>a</b> non-supersymmetric AdS <b>vacuum.</b> We also show that these five-branes can be stabilized <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dS <b>vacuum,</b> if we modify the supergravity potential energy by Fayet-Iliopoulos terms. This allows us to stabilize all heterotic M-theory moduli <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dS <b>vacuum</b> <b>in</b> the most general compactification scenarios. In addition, we demonstrate that, by this modification, one can create an inflationary potential. The inflationary phase is represented by a five-brane approaching the visible brane. We give a qualitative argument how extra states becoming light, when the five-brane comes too close, can terminate inflation. Eventually, the five-brane hits the visible brane and disappears through a small instanton transition. The post-inflationary system of moduli has simpler stability properties. It can be stabilized <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dS <b>vacuum</b> with <b>a</b> small cosmological constant. Comment: 38 pages, 3 figures, minor correction...|$|R

5|$|Beyond the {{slowness}} {{of making}} a new mass standard and the poor reproducibility, there were other intrinsic shortcomings to the ionaccumulation approach {{that proved to be}} formidable obstacles to ion-accumulation-based techniques becoming a practical realization. The apparatus necessarily required that the deposition chamber have an integral balance system to enable the convenient calibration of a reasonable quantity of transfer standards relative to any single internal ion-deposited prototype. Furthermore, the mass prototypes produced by ion deposition techniques would have been nothing like the freestanding platinum-iridium prototypes currently in use; they would have been deposited onto—and become part of—an electrode imbedded into one pan of a special balance integrated into the device. Moreover, the ion-deposited mass wouldn't have had a hard, highly polished surface that can be vigorously cleaned like those of current prototypes. Gold, while dense and a noble metal (resistant to oxidation and the formation of other compounds), is extremely soft so an internal gold prototype would have to be kept well isolated and scrupulously clean to avoid contamination and the potential of wear from having to remove the contamination. Bismuth, which is an inexpensive metal used in low-temperature solders, slowly oxidizes when exposed to room-temperature air and forms other chemical compounds and so would not have produced stable reference masses unless it was continually maintained <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> or inert atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Light that {{travels through}} {{transparent}} matter does so {{at a lower}} speed than c, {{the speed of light}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum.</b> For example, photons engage in so many collisions on the way from the core of the sun that radiant energy can take about a million years to reach the surface; however, once in open space, a photon takes only 8.3 minutes to reach Earth. The factor by which the speed is decreased is called the refractive index of the material. In a classical wave picture, the slowing {{can be explained by the}} light inducing electric polarization in the matter, the polarized matter radiating new light, and that new light interfering with the original light wave to form a delayed wave. In a particle picture, the slowing can instead be described as a blending of the photon with quantum excitations of the matter to produce quasi-particles known as polariton (other quasi-particles are phonons and excitons); this polariton has a nonzero effective mass, which means that it cannot travel at c. Light of different frequencies may travel through matter at different speeds; this is called dispersion (not to be confused with scattering). In some cases, it can result in extremely slow speeds of light in matter. The effects of photon interactions with other quasi-particles may be observed directly in Raman scattering and Brillouin scattering.|$|E
5|$|The recoil {{momentum}} of the produced mendelevium-256 atoms is used to bring them physically {{far away from the}} einsteinium target from which they are produced, bringing them onto a thin foil of metal (usually beryllium, aluminium, platinum, or gold) just behind the target <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum.</b> This eliminates the need for immediate chemical separation, which is both costly and prevents reusing of the expensive einsteinium target. The mendelevium atoms are then trapped in a gas atmosphere (frequently helium), and a gas jet from a small opening in the reaction chamber carries the mendelevium along. Using a long capillary tube, and including potassium chloride aerosols in the helium gas, the mendelevium atoms can be transported over tens of meters to be chemically analyzed and have their quantity determined. The mendelevium can then be separated from the foil material and other fission products by applying acid to the foil and then coprecipitating the mendelevium with lanthanum fluoride, then using a cation-exchange resin column with a 10% ethanol solution saturated with hydrochloric acid, acting as an eluant. However, if the foil is made of gold and thin enough, it is enough to simply dissolve the gold in aqua regia before separating the trivalent actinides from the gold using anion-exchange chromatography, the eluant being 6Mhydrochloric acid.|$|E
