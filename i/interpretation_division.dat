40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} survey of diffuse {{interstellar}} bands (DIBs) in single clouds. High resolution and high S/N observations of DIBs towards lines of sight representing very different environments allow to investigate mutual correlations in a large consistent sample of DIBs. The classification of DIBs into families is reviewed and refined according to these results. We find that the selected 44 DIBs are due to different carriers. Two isolated families of DIBs (λ 5797 et al., λ 4501 et al.) are found, which are mutually slightly anticorrelated. The behaviour of DIBs {{with respect to the}} local UV field is investigated using hydrogen column densities to estimate the strength of the UV field, resulting in the hypothesis that most of the DIB carriers are molecules sensitive to photo-ionization. With this <b>interpretation,</b> the apparent <b>division</b> of interstellar clouds into ζ, σ and Orion types can be understood as a sequence in strength of the UV field. Differences in strength of the UV field between different lines-of-sight are due to the so-called “skin-effect”, the effective shielding of UV radiation by the outer layers of interstellar clouds.

40|$|This is a {{comparative}} study of the epistemology of Suhrawardi and Mulla Sadra Shi razi, two Muslim thinkers of the 6 th/ 12 th and 11 th/ 17 th century. It focuses on two main issues: Illuminative theory of knowledge and, {{in the framework of}} this theory, Mulla Sadra's doctrine of knowledge by presence (al-'ilm al-huduri) studied in the context of his philosophical system (al-hikmah al-muta'ali yah). I have also discussed his methodology which is multidimensional. The aim of this study is not to elaborate on Mulla Sadra's theory of knowledge in general, but rather to present what Mulla Sadra meant by knowledge by presence, al-'ilm al-huduri. However, it is my opinion that his doctrine of knowledge by presence is the corner stone of his epistemological system. In the light of this doctrine, he gives a new definition of knowledge, a novel <b>interpretation</b> of its <b>division</b> into al-'ilm al-huduri and al-'ilm al-husuli, and, finally, a systematic chain of various kinds of knowledge by presence (e. g., self-knowledge, God's knowledge of His Essence and God's knowledge of things).

40|$|African Studies Seminar series. Paper {{presented}} 2 April, 1984 Over {{the last}} twenty years there have been all too many conflicts in Zimbabwean African politics - conflicts between and within African parties and guerrilla movements, divisions amongst voters, strains within the cabinet of the government of independent Zimbabwe. There have also arisen a number of schools of <b>interpretation</b> of such <b>divisions.</b> Some see them in terms of class conflicts; others however see them in terms of ethnicity. They invoke not only the allegedly 'traditional' hostility of 'the Ndebele' and 'the Shona', but also an asserted conflict between Shona sub-ethnicities, the so-called 'Korekore', 'Zeruru', 'Karanga', 'Kalanga' and 'Manyika’…. Analyses such as these raise two main questions in an historian's mind. The first question, to which I shall return briefly {{at the end of this}} chapter, is whether they provide an accurate explanation for recent conflicts. The second question, to which most of this chapter will be devoted, is from where the idea of such entities as the 'Manyika', the 'Zezuru' and the rest has come. These entities certainly do not represent pre-colonial 'historical fact', nor can they in the present be properly described as 'tribes' or 'clans', no matter that both Africans and European commentators employ these terms. Yet they evidently have come to possess a subjective reality in the minds not only of commentators but of participants. How has this come to pass...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{begins with}} questions about the epistemic methods that late-nineteenth and early-twentieth-century American Protestants used to create confidence in new religious ideas, and particularly the role of scientific rhetoric in this confidence making. It concentrates on early Protestant fundamentalists {{and the emergence of}} dispensationalism modernism. Distinct from dispensational premillennialism [...] a set of theological ideas about prophecy belief and the end times [...] dispensational modernism was a constellation of epistemic ideas and methods used to interpret texts and time. Historians have traditionally portrayed fundamentalists and dispensationalists as anti-modern, reactionary foes of modern scientific reasoning. Yet early dispensational thinkers created new, modernist methods for readings texts (particularly the Bible) and structuring time (through elaborate interpretations of prophecy). These ideas emerged amidst popular beliefs about the power of quantification, classification, and scientific analysis to construct firm religious knowledge. While liberal higher critics adopted practices of interpreting texts in light of the times [...] particularly historicism [...] dispensationalists took a contrary approach and interpreted the times in light of the text of the Bible. Seeing time as divinely ordered and classified with distinct divisions, dispensationalists argued that the meaning of time came from without, through supernatural ruptures in the temporal order. Dispensationalism thrived in the interdenominational networks of mainstream and conservative Protestant clergy who sought to retain intellectual authority for biblical interpretation. As knowledge production became increasingly specialized and professionalized [...] the domain of elites [...] dispensational methods provided clergy means to navigate the tension between the need for specialized expertise and popular appeal. These ideas took canonical form in the Scofield Reference Bible, first published in 1909 and still the best-selling reference Bible in American history. The reference notes in Scofield's Bible [...] condensed expert <b>interpretations</b> and taxonomic <b>divisions</b> [...] promised methodological proficiency and theological confidence to anyone who studied it.

40|$|The {{range of}} {{views on the}} nature of {{financial}} control is rather wide. Herewith the researchers focus on the monitoring system of state agencies in exclusively financial and economic activity of economic entities. The analysis of scientists’ opinions presented in the special economic and legal literature suggests that there are several points of view on the concept of state financial control: 1) certain type of government; 2) control functions of the government; 3) the ways and means; 4) the scope of the specially authorized state bodies; 5) activity of the state. Certainly, these views do not fully reflect the essence of the state financial control. For a clear understanding of its essence, to author’s mind, it should be considered comprehensively in a coordinate system: goal → way (means) → result. Concerning the state financial control it is important to mention control not only over the formation, reproduction and use of national heritage, but also its <b>division.</b> <b>Interpretation</b> of the term only as one of the stages of the budget process significantly reduces the understanding of its essence as state financial control includes control over the state budget and the budgets of state non-budgetary funds, the organization of monetary circulation, the use of credit resources as internal and external public debt state property as a source of revenue, state reserves, the provision of financial and tax privileges and preferences. State financial control in its essence is much larger than the budget one, as well as finance – than the budget. In author’s opinion, the state financial control, besides the budget, includes tax, customs, currency control, control of money circulation and state debt, banking and insurance control, control over professional stock market participants, as well as control over the pricing system in the country and economic concentration (antimonopoly control) ...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{composed}} of three chapters. While chapter 1 stands on it’s own, chapters 2 and 3 are related in topic and grew out of two parts of a single paper. Hence, even though they constitute largely independent treatments of separate questions they have a unique introduction and conclusion. Chapter 1 considers a dynamic tournament setting where feedback gives agents the possibility {{to learn about the}} productivity of a technology they are using. If the technology proves unsatisfactory, they have the possibility of switching to a different one. However, it is shown that full feedback does not lead to the efficient technology choice in a tournament setting. Risk neutral agents will behave as risk averse in some cases and risk loving in others. It is shown that the inefficiency can be ameliorated by giving the later period more weight for the allocation of the tournament prize. In a setting with effort. feedback will induce the agents to exert higher effort in the presence of learning. Finally, the efficient technology choice can be achieved using partial feedback. Chapters 2 and 3 investigate the phenomenon of kindness towards strangers. Seemingly altruistic behaviour can follow from purely selfish motives if agents face risk. In a repeated dictator game setting, a charitable equilibrium can be sustained if dictators have a positive probability to change roles, even with anonymous transactions. This also holds if behaviour cannot be monitored perfectly. The main driving factor for charitable behaviour is the desire to sustain the social norm of kindness, from which the charitable agent herself might benefit in the future. This can be interpreted as an informal insurance arrangement in the absence of enforceable contracts. Furthermore, we examine how cooperation is complicated by inequality, in terms of heterogeneous risk exposure. We study how more persistent differences in risk make cooperation increasingly hard to achieve. Moreover, heterogeneity can lead to a fragmentation of society, where cooperation is only possible within subgroups, leading to losses in welfare. The model allows for interesting <b>interpretations</b> of social <b>divisions</b> in societies of varying heterogeneity...|$|R
40|$|Literature {{study shows}} {{a lack of}} Swedish nature {{interpretation}} research. The Swedish Centre for Nature Interpretation (SCNI) was established in 2007 by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency and the Swedish University for Agricultural Sciences. One task of SCNI is to initiate research on nature interpretation. This research overview is intended to provide a jumping-off point. The main purpose was to investigate Swedish research that contributes to development of theory and practice in nature interpretation. In addition, research from other Nordic countries as well as international research was reviewed. A literature search for Swedish scientific publications on nature interpretation, explicitly, revealed a scarcity of such research in Sweden. Of course identifying such studies depends, in part, on how “nature interpretation” and “research” are defined. There are actually a number of Swedish researchers who work with topics {{that are relevant to}} nature interpretation, and to some extent this research is also published in scientific media. However, there is a larger quantity of educational literature. Overall, the main finding of this literature search is that nature interpretation research has not been conducted in Sweden, to date. However, relevant studies were found in such areas as outdoor recreation, nature tourism, education for sustainable development, outdoor education, environmental history, museology and environmental psychology. Various key words have been used in the selected databases, since “nature interpretation” generates no scientific hits. Definitions and pedagogical principles for nature interpretation are described {{in the first part of}} the report. Then international nature interpretation research and some different occurring theories are presented. Emphasis is then put on Swedish and Nordic research that is relevant for developing nature interpretation. The main findings below include conclusions from both the international and the Swedish/Nordic research and indicate some possible directions for development of nature interpretation research, in Sweden and elsewhere. NATURE INTERPRETATION CAN BE BOTH A MEANS OR AN END IN ITSELF There is a need for scientific development of nature interpretation evaluation principles. In Sweden, but also elsewhere, a common goal for publicly financed nature interpretation is to influence people in the direction of sustainable development. Research on interpretation evaluation is needed in order to know whether various activities correspond to our expectations. Also, there is a need to question whether this goal of influencing people is transparent and democratic enough. Internationally, there are both researchers who claim that interpretation can have a positive effect on environmental attitudes and behavior, and those who claim that effective evaluation methodologies for exploring such relationships need further development. Worldwide, interpretive evaluation research has focused heavily on knowledge gain and impacts on attitudes and behaviour, but it has seldom partitioned out the role of the emotional aspects of nature experience, although interpretation instructions stress revelation and provocation for instance. The notion of “participants gaining knowledge” could be widened and include mutual and experiential learning processes. Unlike environmental education, interpretation usually is a rather time limited activity.  That could also be a reason to why long term interpretation effects are difficult to evaluate. If any effects appear, it would still be difficult to distinguish what has generated them. Nature interpretation is sometimes seen as a means for fulfilling a greater objective, but in other cases it is seen as an end in itself. For instance, within outdoor recreation, nature interpretation activities could be considered an end in themselves. Whereas nature interpretation efforts within state run nature conservation could be a means for legitimating and promoting poli-tical nature conservation decisions. NATURE INTERPRETATION AS A COMMUNICATIVE ACT The literature review indicated that the number of Swedish or international publications focusing on the communicative act of nature interpretation from an interactional micro perspective seems to be limited. What is happening within and between the persons during a nature interpretation session? How does the interpretation process really occur? Is the interpreter or the participant the one who makes the interpretation for instance? What kind of learning is taking place? CRITICAL RESEARCH ON NATURE INTERPRETATION COULD DEVELOP THEORY AND PRACTICE When discussing what Swedish nature interpretation research could concentrate on, there is not only a need to discuss the topics, but also different scientific approaches that could facilitate a greater understanding. Much of the Nordic research referred in this report is carried out within a positivistic research tradition doing quantitative studies. When approaching social science there are also some publications within hermeneutic research tradition. Critical research tradition, however, is rare among the studies reviewed. Since nature interpretation is not a natural science phenomenon, but a social one, nature interpretation research based on social constructivism has an obvious importance in further development of Swedish nature interpretation research. The role of nature interpretation in society could be better understood by analyzing what discourses characterize Swedish nature interpretation practice today. What ideas of man and nature are taken for granted which could affect the content and format of nature interpretation? Nature interpretation contributes to constructing our nature experiences, something that is seldom analysed. What values and rationalities holds the Swedish nature interpretation discourses? These questions require a critical dimension of nature <b>interpretation</b> research. Another <b>division</b> to make is research that looks for improving nature interpretation practice (how to do good interpretation), versus research that looks for understanding the phenomenon of nature interpretation (research about interpretation). Both kinds are needed. EXAMPLES ON CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF NATURE INTERPRETATION Some discussions in museology are highly relevant to nature interpretation as well. A quote by Ella Johansson (2001) about open air museums illustrates several of the inherent paradoxes in interpretation that could be interesting to further investigate. “… some contrary – or maybe complementary – aspects are lasting and necessary features in a museum: authenticity versus scene, critical distance versus deep empathy, creating knowledge versus ideology, education versus Sunday pleasure. ” The content and format of nature interpretation is always a mental and social product, where the involved individuals decide what phenomena and objects are paid attention to and what questions and explanations are suggested. Søren Kruse (2002) argues that “the interpreter designs the participants’ nature visits and determines thereby frames for their nature experiences”. He further writes that: “Nature interpretation is in the centre of the normative minefield of pedagogics, where one could ask oneself: With what right can the nature interpreters claim that their design of nature visits is better than the nature contact designed by the participants themselves? My point of departure is that nature interpretation is not an interpretation of nature, but a production and reproduction of socially constructed descriptions of nature and our relations with it. ” THE NEED OF ADVANCING NATURE INTERPRETATION RESEARCH IN SWEDEN Advancement of Swedish research on nature interpretation is needed for several reasons. There are national prerequisites that are unique, such as the Swedish right of public access to nature. Swedish nature interpretation is not yet systematically evaluated from a scientific point of view. There are also a number of educational programmes in Swedish universities within nature guidance and nature interpretation, and connecting these educational efforts to research would strengthen their quality. However, nature interpretation is not a research discipline, but rather a topic that requires research from various perspectives. That interdisciplinary context could be treated by different branches – from public health science, to cultural studies, to forest sciences, if it is combined with communication science, pedagogics or similar fields. Environmental psychology, marketing and media sciences could also provide knowledge about behavioural impacts that nature interpretation often aims for in a general context...|$|R
