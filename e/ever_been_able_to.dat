5|$|The {{supposed}} refusals {{from these}} first three artists to participate {{was seen as}} evidence of self-censorship {{out of fear of}} violence from Islamists, which led to much debate in Denmark. The Danish news paper Politiken stated at February 12, 2006, that they asked Bluitgen to put them in touch with the artists, so the claim that none of them dared to work with him could be proved. The author refused, and nobody has <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> confirm whether the incident is properly described.|$|E
5|$|Zoe {{goes on a}} {{parachute}} jump with Fernando Fernandez (Jeronimo Best), Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson), Gilly and Sarah. Sarah's ex-girlfriend Lydia appears and is jealous of Sarah and Zoe's friendship. Lydia lies to Zoe, telling her that Sarah had attempted suicide after their affair the previous year, and warns her {{to stay away from}} Sarah. That night, Sarah and Zoe get drunk and return to their tent, where Sarah makes a pass at Zoe. Sarah reveals that whilst she had not intended to kiss her, Zoe was the only person she had <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> rely upon. Zoe and Sarah later discover Lydia's lies and Sarah decides to end their relationship for good during a discussion with Zoe. Lydia overhears the conversation and sabotages Zoe's parachute before the jump in an attempt to kill her. When the parachutes are mixed up by accident, Zoe's deploys successfully, but Sarah falls to her death. Upset, Zoe ends up sleeping with a grieving Mike for comfort. Lydia slits her wrists after planting the knife she had sabotaged the parachute with behind Zoe's bed. Zoe is then arrested in front of Mike under suspicion of Sarah's murder and is later charged.|$|E

25|$|The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission {{landed the}} Curiosity rover that is {{currently}} in operation on Mars. It was launched 26 November 2011, and landed at Gale Crater on 6 August 2012. Mission objectives are to help assess Mars' habitability and in doing so, determine whether Mars is or has <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> support life, collect data for a future human mission, study Martian geology, its climate, and further assess the role that water, an essential ingredient for {{life as we know}} it, played in forming minerals on Mars.|$|E
500|$|Michael Stipe {{sings in}} what R.E.M. biographer David Buckley {{described}} as [...] "wailing, keening, arching vocal figures". Stipe often harmonizes with Mills in songs; {{in the chorus}} for [...] "Stand", Mills and Stipe alternate singing lyrics, creating a dialogue. Early articles about the band focused on Stipe's singing style (described as [...] "mumbling" [...] by The Washington Post), which often rendered his lyrics indecipherable. Creem writer John Morthland wrote in his review of Murmur, [...] "I still {{have no idea what}} these songs are about, because neither me nor anyone else I know has <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> discern R.E.M.'s lyrics." [...] Stipe commented in 1984, [...] "It's just the way I sing. If I tried to control it, it would be pretty false." [...] Producer Joe Boyd convinced Stipe to begin singing more clearly during the recording of Fables of the Reconstruction.|$|E

500|$|David {{consciously}} {{followed in}} the path of Hilda Leyel and Dorothy Hartley in researching British ingredients and dishes. [...] Like them, she looked back into regional history to find what she saw as [...] "the traditions of a culture rooted to the soil" [...] before [...] "the ravages of the Industrial Revolution". She did not romanticise Britain's culinary past: [...] "Farm and factory labourers, artisans and clerical workers, still lived on a very restricted diet... their cooking facilities were so primitive and their equipment so scanty that only the most basic forms of cookery could be attempted". But her constant benchmarks were honest ingredients and uncomplicated cooking. She condemned—and explained the alternatives to—the artificial, the ersatz, the [...] "notorious Chorleywood bread", and [...] "all synthetic aids to flavouring... Nobody has <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> find out why the English regard a glass of wine added to a soup or stew as a reckless extravagance {{and at the same time}} spend pounds on bottled sauces, gravy powders, soup cubes, ketchups and artificial flavourings".|$|E
500|$|His wealth {{continued}} to grow significantly (in line with U.S. economic growth) after as the demand for gasoline soared, eventually reaching about $900 million {{on the eve of}} the First World War, including significant interests in banking, shipping, mining, railroads, and other industries. According to the New York Times obituary, [...] "it was estimated after Mr. Rockefeller retired from business that he had accumulated close to $1,500,000,000 out of the earnings of the Standard Oil trust and out of his other investments. This was probably the greatest amount of wealth that any private citizen had <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> accumulate by his own efforts." [...] By the time of his death in 1937, Rockefeller's remaining fortune, largely tied up in permanent family trusts, was estimated at $1.4 billion, while the total national GDP was $92 billion. According to some methods of wealth calculation, Rockefeller's net worth over the last decades of his life would easily place him as the wealthiest known person in recent history. As a percentage of the United States' GDP, no other American fortune — including those of Bill Gates or Sam Walton — would even come close.|$|E
500|$|Moran {{cared for}} Poe at the for-profit Washington College Hospital on Broadway and Fayette Street. He was denied any {{visitors}} and was confined in a prison-like room with barred windows {{in a section}} of the building reserved for drunk people. Poe is said to have repeatedly called out the name [...] "Reynolds" [...] on the night before his death, though no one has <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> identify the person to whom he referred. One possibility is that he was recalling an encounter with Jeremiah N. Reynolds, a newspaper editor and explorer who may have inspired the novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket. Another possibility is Henry R. Reynolds, one of the judges overseeing the Fourth Ward Polls at Ryan's Tavern, who may have met Poe on Election Day. Poe may have instead been calling for [...] "Herring", as the author had an uncle-in-law in Baltimore named Henry Herring. In later testimonies Moran avoided reference to Reynolds but mentioned a visit by a [...] "Misses Herring". He also claimed he attempted to cheer up Poe during {{one of the few times}} Poe was awake. When Moran told his patient that he would soon be enjoying the company of friends, Poe allegedly replied that [...] "the best thing his friend could do would be to blow out his brains with a pistol".|$|E

500|$|During Offenbach's lifetime, {{and in the}} {{obituary}} notices in 1880, fastidious critics (dubbed [...] "Musical Snobs Ltd" [...] by Gammond) showed themselves at odds with public appreciation. In a 1980 article in The Musical Times, George Hauger commented that those critics not only underrated Offenbach, but wrongly supposed that his music would soon be forgotten. Although most critics of the time made that erroneous assumption, a few perceived Offenbach's unusual quality; in The Times, Francis Hueffer wrote, [...] "none of his numerous Parisian imitators has <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> rival Offenbach at his best." [...] Nevertheless, the paper joined in the general prediction: [...] "It is very doubtful whether any of his works will survive." [...] The New York Times shared this view: [...] "That he had the gift of melody in a very extraordinary degree {{is not to be}} denied, but he wrote currente calamo, and the lack of development of his choicest inspirations will, it is to be feared, keep them from reaching even the next generation". After the posthumous production of The Tales of Hoffmann, The Times partially reconsidered its judgment, writing, [...] "Les Contes de Hoffmann [...] confirm the opinion of those who regard him as a great composer {{in every sense of the}} word". It then lapsed into what Gammond calls [...] "Victorian sanctimoniousness" [...] by taking it for granted that the opera [...] "will uphold Offenbach's fame long after his lighter compositions have passed out of memory." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ghost hunting {{has been}} heavily criticized for its {{dismissal}} of the scientific method. No scientific study has <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> confirm the existence of ghosts. The practice is considered a pseudoscience by {{a vast majority of}} educators, academics, science writers, and skeptics. Science historian Brian Regal described ghost hunting as [...] "an unorganized exercise in futility".|$|E
2500|$|Since 2013, Stavans {{has been}} the {{publisher}} of Restless Books, an imprint based in Brooklyn. Producing books of fiction and nonfiction, graphic novels, travel writing, criticism, and visual arts, the company describes itself as [...] "an international publisher for readers and writers in search of new destinations, experiences, and perspectives." [...] James Bridle of The Guardian wrote that Restless [...] "finally delivers {{on the promise of}} electronic books to go wider and deeper into world literature than paper publishing has <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> do." ...|$|E

As Christopher Milne wrote in his autobiography: [...] "Pooh’s forest and Ashdown Forest are identical". For example, the fictional [...] "Hundred Acre Wood" [...] was in reality Five Hundred Acre Wood; Galleon's Leap was inspired by the prominent hilltop of Gill's Lap, while a clump of trees just north of Gill's Lap became Christopher Robin's The Enchanted Place because no-one had <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> count whether there were sixty-three or sixty-four trees in the circle.|$|E
2500|$|On October 5, 1993, Bloomquist {{was arrested}} and charged for {{possessing}} 2.7grams of cocaine.

And she talked me into doing something that no one else has <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> do." [...] Bloomquist was found not guilty of felony sale and distribution and guilty of misdemeanor drug possession and possessing drug paraphernalia. [...] "When they searched the house they found a short straw that had some residue of cocaine in it. The girl had left it there," [...] Bloomquist said. He was sentenced in November 1994 to the maximum penalty, a $5,000 fine and one year in prison. It was his first misdemeanor conviction, and he filed an appeal. His sentence was cut in half to 6 months in jail. He served his time as a work release beginning in 1997.|$|E
2500|$|Jay, {{who served}} as {{vice-president}} (1816–21) and president (1821–27) of the American Bible Society, believed that {{the most effective way}} of ensuring world peace was through propagation of the Christian gospel. In a letter addressed to Pennsylvania House of Representatives member John Murray, dated October 12, 1816, Jay wrote, [...] "Real Christians will abstain from violating the rights of others, and therefore will not provoke war. Almost all nations have peace or war at the will and pleasure of rulers whom they do not elect, and who are not always wise or virtuous. Providence has given to our people the choice of their rulers, and it is the duty, as well as the privilege and interest, of our Christian nation to select and prefer Christians for their rulers." [...] He also expressed a belief that the moral precepts of Christianity were necessary for good government, saying, [...] "No human society has <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> maintain both order and freedom, both cohesiveness and liberty apart from the moral precepts of the Christian Religion. Should our Republic ever forget this fundamental precept of governance, we will then, be surely doomed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Early on Chesterton {{showed a}} great {{interest}} in and talent for art. He had planned to become an artist, and his writing shows a vision that clothed abstract ideas in concrete and memorable images. [...] Even his fiction contained carefully concealed parables. Father Brown is perpetually correcting the incorrect vision of the bewildered folks {{at the scene of the}} crime and wandering off at the end with the criminal to exercise his priestly role of recognition and repentance. For example, in the story [...] "The Flying Stars", Father Brown entreats the character Flambeau to give up his life of crime: [...] "There is still youth and honour and humour in you; don't fancy they will last in that trade. Men may keep a sort of level of good, but no man has <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> keep on one level of evil. That road goes down and down. The kind man drinks and turns cruel; the frank man kills and lies about it. Many a man I've known started like you to be an honest outlaw, a merry robber of the rich, and ended stamped into slime." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1905, Baum {{declared}} {{plans for}} an Oz amusement park. In an interview, he mentioned buying Pedloe Island {{off the coast of}} California to turn it into an Oz park.

[...] Nevertheless, Baum stated to the press that he had discovered a Pedloe Island off the coast of California and that he had purchased it to be [...] "the Marvelous Land of Oz," [...] intending it to be [...] "a fairy paradise for children." [...] Eleven year old Dorothy Talbot of San Francisco was reported to be ascendant to the throne on March 1, 1906, when the Palace of Oz was expected to be completed. Baum planned to live on the island, with administrative duties handled by the princess and her all-child advisers. Plans included statues of the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, Jack Pumpkinhead, and H.M.

2500|$|The Skyscrapers {{quickly became}} {{involved}} in a feud with the Road Warriors, sparked by Teddy Long's actions {{while he was still}} a referee. The two teams were very evenly matched in power and intensity, creating a series of matches that did not favor one team over the other. Spivey and Vicious were disqualified against the Road Warriors at Halloween Havoc. Shortly after Halloween Havoc, the Skyscrapers faced the Steiner Brothers at [...] in a hard hitting match. Sid Vicious suffered a punctured lung due to a broken rib. With Vicious out of action, Teddy Long brought in another tall newcomer in the same mold as Sid Vicious and Dan Spivey and dubbed him [...] "Mean" [...] Mark Callous. The New Skyscrapers immediately picked up the feud with the Road Warriors and kept on having inconclusive matches with them. At [...] the Skyscrapers finally got the better of the Road Warriors, not in the match, but afterwards when they beat the Road Warriors down. At this point in time, no one had <b>ever</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> physically dominate the Road Warriors, something that pointed that big things had been planned for the Skyscrapers. However, {{in the days before the}} scheduled Chicago Street Fight at WrestleWar 1990, Dan Spivey suddenly left WCW, leaving the bookers to scramble for a replacement.
