I’ve never seen anyone who could play drums like that - the talk in the early days was often about Reni - “check out the amazing drummer” hipsters would say and he always delivered. If the Roses ever reformed it would be a buzz just to see him play those drums again - dextrous, fluid and exuberant - he could hit hard like a rock drummer but also had a real swing and that infectious energy.” ...|$|E

40|$|In early[*]September, {{kindergarten}} {{teachers and}} parents noticed that children were very curious about rocks. Pockets and cubbies swelled with personal collections from the playground, the park, and other nearby outdoor places. Rocks and pebbles were exchanged like gifts, and crystals and fossils soon became classroom currency. As they played, the children began to invent and develop a descriptive rock vocabulary to more clearly differentiate and communicate obvious and subtle differences. There were the sparkly ones, the marking ones, the volcanic ones, the ones that look like metal, the fossils, and the crystals. Then there were the kind {{that came from the}} fairies and even the ones from the moon. Children asked each other questions based on their observations: How did you get that to be so sparkly? How do you think this rock was made? Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> one? Thinking together in these ways helps children build deeper understandings and allows them to develop a scaf-fold on which to build more meaningful connections. By listening carefully to children as they ask questions and talk together, teachers can incorporate children’s questions and interests into an inquiry-based curriculum that supports various types of learners. What is inquiry-based learning? Inquiry—investigating to gather information—is a part of human behavior from the moment we are born. Infants use all their senses—seeing, hearing, touching, tasting, and smelling—to explore and to collect information. Babies observe and turn toward faces, grasp at objects to put in their mouths, and follow objects with their eyes, all to gain more information (Thornton 2003). When a toddler repeat-edly drops a ball into a tube and watches it vanish, he exhib-its delight each time the ball disappears and then reappears somewhere else. It is as though he is wondering, "Will it Uchenna Ogu[*]an...|$|E
40|$|For {{nearly twenty}} years, my primary studio {{production}} {{has been in}} the form of mixed media quilts. These quilts draw—both visually and conceptually—on the abandoned houses that color the landscape of my North Carolina mountain home. They are constructed using traditional quilting techniques married with digital processes and acrylic paint—a hybrid product that lands at the intersection of fibers, photography, painting and digital media. Although their conceptual purpose is to investigate the narrative past, present and future of these homes and their values, the questions with which I am most often quizzed at exhibitions focus purely on time and technique: “How did you put the image on the fabric?” “Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> abandoned house?” “What kind of printer do you use?” “How long did that piece take?” “How many stitches are in that?” These questions—which I always happily answer—became the seeds of new questions I began asking myself: What is the actual value of the product of my labors? How many stitches—particularly French knots—really are in this thing? What is the true value of a specific stitch, like the French knot? Can I pay for a cheeseburger with French knots? Or, perhaps more appropriately, a craft beer? Does it matter whether or not my hands make the stitches? How does the value change when stitched by another? Is value contained in the product or in the process? How is the value of an idea quantified? Does the hand really matter? And so, I began tentatively answering these questions through my art. Since 2010, I have employed the French knot as the basic unit of measure for the work of the hand. When I am not making quilts, I am stitching (and counting) French knots. These knots are a meditative undertaking for me. My hands make them automatically, freeing my mind to count repeatedly to ten and wander in between. The knots I make are absolutely, completely, entirely and only themselves and only about themselves. They are freed from the weight of imagery. Their existence is self-referential. I make them as the physical embodiment of my own questions about the value of making itself. Each piece is stretched on a frame and finished with manufactured froo-froo lace. This finishing treatment is both a nod to traditional embroidery presentation as well as mild self-mockery of my own ridiculous process. Each piece is titled and priced solely based on the quantity of knots composing it. Quality of design, variety of colors, compositional success, and level of finishing froo-froo-ness have no bearing on their worth. Interestingly, by preemptively answering the numeric questions of my audience, the conversations that arise when these pieces are on display have been elevated. Instead of pure interrogations about time and technique, we discuss how those variables translate into value and worth. We discuss the historic and ongoing undervaluing of traditional “women’s work”. We discuss the comparable valuing of different materials and processes within the art world: painting vs. quilting, photography vs. fabric, stone vs. stitch. We discuss the very definitions of art, craft, and design, and how these definitions limit or celebrate the perceptions of the work created within their parameters...|$|E
