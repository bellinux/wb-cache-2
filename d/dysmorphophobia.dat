BDD is different from Koro. In Koro, a patient is overcome with the belief that his penis is actively shrinking, and it may be in imminent danger of disappearing.

5000|$|The body dysmorphic {{disorder}} or <b>dysmorphophobia</b> {{characterized by}} {{desire to be a}} eunuch is called skoptic syndrome, named after the Skoptzy sect. However, in the latest issue of the DSM, there are no references to the term, and it is virtually unknown in psychological literature. It is also important to notice that the term, along with gender identity disorder (GID), can and is also used to imply [...] "minority mainstream view/practices" [...] without negatively implying dysfunction or [...] "wrongness", nor is it applicable to all people with a desire for castration, due to the highly diverse nature of reasons for volunteer castration. This particularly in view that castration has a history, up to the modern age, of therapeutic use; according to Victor T. Cheney, in his Castration: Advantages and Disadvantages (Authorhouse, Dec. 2003), castration has been documented to effectively reduce symptoms in people with schizophrenia, psychosis, violent behaviors, paraphilias, mania, overactive libido, baldness, sleep apnea and prostate disorders (all things that are exacerbated by testosterone), as well as reducing the incidence of various sexually transmitted diseases, by means of eliminated or reduced sexual activity. Some men seek relief from physical or psychological problems, while others derive sexual excitement from the idea of being castrated or otherwise having their genitals mutilated, usually by another person (see masochism and paraphilia). This desire is still present in modern populations, as evidenced in the large membership in message boards on the Internet related to the topic. There has been frequent news coverage of incidents of self-castration and underground networks of people without medical licenses performing castrations, because this condition is not medically recognized.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Strabismus is {{a serious}} {{ophthalmological}} and cosmetic disorder which may cause psychological discomfort. An increased incidence of various mental disturbances in patients with squint has been described. Affected children and adolescents experience more difficulties at school and worse results in sport. Squint may cause a disadvantageous social reception and may sometimes {{make it difficult to}} get a satisfying job. It may considerably decrease the quality of life. Objective: This study addressed three questions: 1) Is strabismus linked to psychiatric and psychological disorders? 2) Can it influence social competences? 3) Is it linked to <b>dysmorphophobia</b> (DSM-IV) ? Material and methods: Thirty persons with strabismus at the age of 13 - 17 years were compared with the control group of 30 persons of the same age, without eye problems. To detect psychiatric problems GHQ- 28 scale was used. To assess social competences the Social Competence Questionnaire KKS (Kwestionariusz Kompetencji Społecznych) was used. <b>Dysmorphophobia</b> symptoms were measured using the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Examination (BDDE). Results: There were no statistically significant differences in the incidence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, functioning, social competences or <b>dysmorphophobia</b> in adolescents with strabismus, as compared to the control group. Significantly worse social competences were shown by those adolescents with strabismus who underwent surgical treatment, as compared to other persons with squint (p= 0. 006). Discussion: In literature, we have not found any studies on social competences in young people with strabismus. The prevalence of <b>dysmorphophobia</b> was not confirmed among them. No higher incidence of psychiatric disorders was observed in our study in adolescents with strabismus...|$|E

Empirical studies on the concepts of body schema, body concept and body cathexis are reported. Many of these studies have serious methodological shortcomings. The correlation of disturbances of body experience with other psychopathology is considered. Standardised methods for assessing these disturbances are listed. Effects of body-oriented psychotherapy have been suggested, but not empirically tested. Finally, the possible relevance of further {{research in this field}} is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Trauma repair, deformity, and {{unsightly}} blemishes {{may cause}} social embarrassment and take thousands {{of individuals to}} plastic sur-geons.

40|$|We {{look into}} the {{transformation}} of meanings in psychotherapy and suggest a clinical application for Wittgenstein’s intuitions concerning the role of linguistic practices in generating significance. In post-modern theory, therapy does not necessarily change reality {{as much as it}} does our way of experiencing it by intervening in the linguistic-representational rules responsible for constructing the text which expresses the problem. Since “states of mind assume the truths and forms of the language devices that we use to represent them” (Foucault, 1963, p. 57), therapy may be intended as a narrative path toward a new naming of one’s reified experiences. The clinical problem we consider here, the pervasive feeling of inadequacy due to one’s excessive height (<b>dysmorphophobia),</b> is an excellent example of “language game” by which a “perspicuous representation” (the “therapy” proposed by Wittgenstein in the 1953) may bring out alternatives to linguisticallybuilt “traps”, putting the blocked semiotic mechanism back into motion...|$|E
40|$|Body dysmorphic {{disorder}} (BDD), {{also known}} as <b>dysmorphophobia,</b> is a severe psychiatric disorder that occurs around the world. However, the diagnosis is usually missed in clinical settings. It {{is important to recognize}} and diagnose BDD, because this disorder is relatively common and causes significant distress and impairment in functioning. It is also associated with markedly poor quality of life. Although research on effective treatment is still limited, serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are currently considered the medication treatment of choice. For symptoms to improve, a relatively high SRI dose and at least 12 weeks of treatment is often needed. The psychosocial treatment of choice is cognitive behavioral therapy, consisting of elements such as exposure, response prevention, behavioral experiments, and cognitive restructuring. Although knowledge of BDD is rapidly increasing, further research is needed on all aspects of this disorder, including treatment studies, epidemiology studies, and investigation of its cross-cultural features and pathogenesis...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{case study}} of a 30 -year-old male diastrophic dwarf who complained of hypertrichosis on his back and nose of 3 years duration. He had no {{previous}} psychiatric history, and although the distortion he described on his back was not apparent to others, there was a minimal amount of dark hair growth on his nose. He had unresolved conflicts concerning his disproportionate arms and legs and had sought surgical correction for many years from many orthopedic surgeons to no avail. After a diagnosis of <b>dysmorphophobia</b> was made by a psychiatric consultant, weekly visits with the dermatologist were arranged for supportive psychotherapy combined with electro-epilation of the hair growth on his nose.

Our findings indicate that individual and group cognitive behavioral therapies are superior to waiting list for the treatment of body dysmorphic disorder. While the efficacy of cognitive therapy is supported by one controlled trial, utility of behavioral therapy is suggested by one open study and one controlled relapse prevention follow-up study.
