40|$|Predation on cattle by the {{endangered}} jaguar (Panthera onca) {{can be a}} serious ecological and economic conflict. We investigated habitat characteristics of kill sites of cattle in Sonora, Mexico, from 1999 to 2004 to see whether habitat management or cattle distribution {{could be used as}} effective nonlethal methods to limit predation. Kill-sites were positively associated with oak, semitropical thornscrub, and xeric thornscrub vegetation types, whereas they were negatively associated with upland mesquite. Sites of cattle kills were also positively associated with proximity to permanent water sources and roads. A model including these relationships fi t kill locations well (AUC = 0. 933) and correctly classified 93 % of all kill-site locations. Because kill-sites were associated with specific habitat attributes, management practices that alter cattle distribution, such as placement of permanent water sources in uplands, <b>herding,</b> and <b>fencing</b> riparian areas characterized by frequent depredations, can be used to minimize co-occurrence of jaguars and cattle and, thus, potentially limit predation without illegal killing of jaguars. These practices could also lead to more uniform use of pastures and, consequently, higher stocking rates, resulting in increased profitability to landowners. Managing habitat attributes that predispose cattle to predation may provide a viable alternative for maintaining both livestock enterprises and a large endangered carnivore in areas of conflict...|$|R

Nitrogen (N) being {{one of the most critical}} nutrients for agricultural production, studies were done to assess its management in <b>Herding,</b> Tethering, <b>Fenced,</b> Semi-intensive and Zero grazing dairy systems. Data were collected on transfers of materials to obtain N balances on basis of the farm as an entity (“Farm” balances) and for areas under a specific crop or crop mixture (“Cropping Area” balances). Nitrogen balances were mainly negative with positive “Farm” balances featuring only for Zero grazing (16 – 35 kg ha− 1 season− 1) and Tethering (12 kg ha− 1 season− 1) and positive “Cropping Area” balances only within the Tethering category (1 kg ha− 1 season− 1). Most inefficient utilization of N was within the Zero grazing category where the difference between the “Farm” and “Cropping Area” balances was 55 kg ha− 1 season− 1. Nitrogen input requirements into the “Cropping Areas” to off-set negative N imbalances were in the ranges of 207 – 2143 kg ha− 1 season− 1 of cattle manure equivalent to 6 – 60 kg ha− 1 season− 1 of urea...|$|R

40|$|Setting up {{fences and}} {{fetching}} animals {{is a highly}} time consuming and labour intensive process. The Virtual Fencing allows farmers {{to set up a}} controlled grazing environment. The technology requires animals to wear an Electronic Containment Device which receives the radio signals from the control centre.

Even though the technology is promising, there is limited information on how Virtual Fencing affects the behaviour and welfare of the animal. Augmented Reality devices helps to get feel of an imaginary environment augmented to the real one.

GonaCon Immunocontraceptive Vaccine (the commercial name for a particular gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) -based emulsion) was tested in adult female white-tailed deer in a <b>fenced</b> <b>herd</b> near Silver Spring, Maryland, USA. Observations of udder condition were used to identify does that had become pregnant. Necropsy observations, histopathology and serum concentrations of anti-GnRH antibodies, luteinising hormone and progesterone were used to compare health and reproductive status of treated (n = 28) and control (n = 15) deer. After receiving one injection of GonaCon, 88 % of treated deer did not become pregnant during the first year and 47 % did not become pregnant during the second year after vaccination. No adverse health effects related to vaccination with GonaCon were detected, except for localized injection site reactions in five (29 %) of 17 examined, vaccinated deer. Treatment with GonaCon can be a safe and effective means of inducing temporary infertility in wild white-tailed deer. Ultimately, the management value of GonaCon will be determined by natural-resource professionals who use it as one of many tools to manage deer populations...|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports the}} results of an {{investigation}} into how rural landowners in Shasta County, California, resolve disputes arising from trespass by livestock. The results provide an empirical perspective {{on one of the most}} celebrated hypothetical cases in the law-and-economics literature. In his landmark article, 2 ̆ 2 The Problem of Social Cost, 2 ̆ 2 economist Ronald Coase invoked as his fundamental example a conflict between two neighbors- a rancher running cattle and a farmer raising crops. Coase used the Parable of the Farmer and the Rancher to illustrate what has come to be known as the Coase Theorem. This unintuitive proposition asserts, in its strongest form, that when transaction costs are zero, a change in the rule of liability will have no effect on the allocation of resources. For example, the Theorem predicts that as long as its admittedly heroic assumptions are met, the imposition of liability for cattle trespass would not cause ranchers to reduce the size of their <b>herds,</b> erect more <b>fencing,</b> or keep closer watch on their livestock. The Theorem has become the most fruitful, yet most controversial, proposition in law-and-economics. Coase himself was fully aware that obtaining information, negotiating agreements, and litigating disputes are all potentially costly, and that thus his Parable might not portray accurately how rural landowners would respond to a change in trespass law. Some law-and-economics scholars, however, assume that transaction costs are indeed often trivial when only two parties are in conflict. Therefore, these scholars might assume that Coase 2 ̆ 7 s Parable faithfully depicts how rural landowners resolve cattle-trespass disputes...|$|R
40|$|Little {{information}} {{is available on the}} contribution of macroalgae to the food web of the Ningaloo lagoon and its importance in the diets of fish associated with it. This {{information is}} important for understanding potential trophic flows from macroalgae to juvenile fish and provides the fundamental data for constructing ecosystem models. In my Honours research, I have examined: the significance of macroalgae, its associated epibionts and infauna in the diets of juvenile and subadult fish in the Ningaloo lagoon, focussing on: 1. the significance of macroalgae in the diets of juvenile fish and how this varies between summer (February) and winter (July) (Chapter 3); and 2. the development and use of an Ecopath with Ecosim ecosystem model to assess trophic flows of macroalgae to functional fish groups (Chapter 4). Fish were sampled in macroalgal beds by a variety of techniques (<b>herding</b> into <b>fence</b> nets by SCUBA, hand spear, and rod and line fishing) in February and July, 2015. A total of 181 fish were caught representing 11 species, with six species caught in both months. Stomach contents were identified to the lowest taxonomic resolution possible and the percent volume of items recorded. Multivariate analyses were used to identify guilds (species with similar diets), and to assess differences in diets between February and July. The results showed that: fleshy macroalgae (e. g. Sargassum spp.) were not as important as filamentous algae to the diets of the juveniles of two nominally herbivorous fish species in February, but became more important in July. Macroalgae were not an important component in the diets of juvenile Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae, or Mullidae, though the infauna associated with the macroalgal beds was important in the diets. Analysis of feeding specialisation found that the smaller size classes of fish in February had a narrower trophic width and a more specialised feeding strategy than larger bodied fish of the same species in July. At this time, fish tended to show a generalist feeding strategy and broad niche width, possibly associated with increasing gape size of the larger fish sampled at this time. These studies provided the basis for defining three distinct functional feeding groups for the Ecopath model: herbivores, zoobenthivores, and carnivores (Chapter 4). The Coral Bay Ecopath model was constructed by modifying an Ecopath model for the Ningaloo system and applying it to an area of the macroalgal beds to examine trophic flows from macroalgae to higher trophic levels. The Coral Bay model had 29 functional groups based on the functional fish feeding groups (adults and juveniles of herbivores, zoobenthivores, carnivore, Lethrinus species and Lethrinus nebulosus - 10 groups) and broad dietary categories (13 groups) identified in Chapter 3, a competitor for algal resources (e. g. turtles - 1 group), predators to the fish groups (e. g. reef sharks and dolphins - 2 groups) and extra groups that were included due to having different functional roles (e. g. phytoplankton, squid and octopus - 3 groups). The model was balanced by adjusting biological parameters, with an emphasis on changing those with the fewest data from the region the most.

40|$|Enclosed game {{reserves}} {{are at risk}} of local vegetation over-utilization and homogenization by elephant. Understanding how the elephant spatial distribution is coupled to their seasonal resources use can aid future management given the threat of climate change. A comparison of home ranges and core area sizes across seasons and years was made between an elephant herd outside in an open system, compared to the elephant inside Limpopo Lipadi Game and Wilderness Reserve (LLGWR). Location data, obtained by GPS-GSM technology, was used to determine seasonal home ranges and core areas by local convex hull (LoCoH) methods and to generate seasonal General Estimating Equations (GEE). Remote sensing data was used to determine habitat variables. The home ranges of the elephant herd outside as expected, was twice as large during summers and a third larger during winters than the elephant <b>herd</b> inside the <b>fenced</b> reserve. The influence of seasonal rainfall on home range size was reflected at home range scale for the outside herd and for the core area scale for the herd inside the reserve. Increased rainfall overcomes the ‗magnet effect‘ of artificial waterholes on elephant distribution in the landscape only in the open system. Inside the reserve, contrary to expectation the winter home ranges were non-significantly larger than summer home ranges due to space limitation induced by fencing and permanent artificial waterhole density. Resource use was evaluated by using GEE models at a scale larger than established home ranges and therefore would reflect as home range determinants. The study confirms that elephant do not use resources randomly. A scale in resource selection of elephant cows exists, with distance to drainage lines at small scale preferred during winter, with aspect, slope, elevation, and NDVI at larger scales. Fencing furthermore, affects the scale at which selection occurs by limiting resource availability, especially during resource restrictive periods and limits range expansion during resource abundant periods. Elephant cows prefer gentle terrain, close to permanent water [< 1. 77 km (SD inside the reserve, and < 2. 33 km (outside the reserve], moderately high NDVI, riparian vegetation during late winter and early summer if available. Generally, during lower rainfall periods lower elevations are preferred along the elevation gradient, and during higher rainfall periods, higher elevations. The elephant herd outside the reserve, furthermore prefer aspects in the landscape during hot summers that are cooling and cool winter aspects that are warming to facilitate energy saving and thermoregulation.

40|$|Bovine virus {{diarrhea}} (BVD) is {{a complicated}} disease to discuss as it {{can result in a}} wide variety of disease problems from very mild to very severe. BVD can be one of the most devastating diseases cattle encounter and one of the hardest to get rid of when it attacks a herd. The viruses that cause BVD have been grouped into two genotypes, Type I and Type II. The disease syndrome caused by the two genotypes is basically the same, however disease caused by Type II infection is often more severe. The various disease syndromes noted in cattle infected with BVD virus are mainly attributed to the age of the animal when it became infected and to certain characteristics of the virus involved. Diseases caused by BVD infection Fetal BVD infections (infection of the unborn calf) : The result of a fetal infection with the BVD virus is usually determined by the age of the fetus at the time of infection. The virus is capable of passing from an infected cow to the unborn fetus which is particularly vulnerable to the BVD virus during the first 6 months of pregnancy. Death of the fetus is common if the infection occurs during the first 120 days of pregnancy and the cow will lose the pregnancy. However, if the fetus survives an early infection, it will be born without a detectable antibody titer and be persistently infected (PI) with the BVD virus. During the first 120 days of gestation, the fetus has an underdeveloped immune system and does not recognize the BVD virus as foreign. The fetus does not mount an immune response against the virus, remains infected, and does not have a detectable anti-BVD titer. It is not uncommon for the surviving fetus to be malformed; blindness, skeletal abnormalities and under-developed brains are common defects noted in such calves. A BVD PI calf may appear normal, be weak at birth, grow poorly, be susceptible to respiratory diseases, and die before they can be weaned. They may also grow normally, reach breeding age, and produce more persistently BVD infected calves (The virus is passed from generation to generation). PI carriers can only be created by infection with BVD virus during the first 110 - 120 days of pregnancy. These animals shed billions of virus particles every day in their urine, feces, and saliva, and are a source of infection for other animals in the herd. If the fetus becomes infected after 120 days of pregnancy, there may be an abortion but usually, because this aged fetus has a more developed immune system and can elicit an immune response against the BVD virus, a healthy calf is born that has a good level of BVD antibody titer. Subclinical BVD infections: Most animals that become infected with BVD never show signs of disease caused by the virus; however infection can lower the animal’s resistance to other infections, which could result in illness. For example, in feedlot calves, BVD infection may go unnoticed, but the lungs become susceptible to infection with bacteria such as Mannheimia haemolytica (previously called Pasteurella haemolytica) and other agents that cause “shipping fever”. Some people believe that BVD is one of the most significant disease organisms involved with respiratory disease of cattle. Severe acute BVD infections: This disease syndrome is usually (but not always) associated with Type II BVD virus infection. The affected animals will exhibit high fevers (107 - 110 F), occasional diarrhea, respiratory disease, and they will not eat. Peracute BVD can affect cattle of all ages and often results in death of the animal within 48 hours of disease onset regardless of age. Acute BVD infections: The classic, acute form of BVD is characterized by a fever of 104 - 106 F, discharge from the nose and eyes, erosions of the muzzle and in the mouth, and diarrhea that may contain mucus and blood. Diarrhea is usually present in every herd that has an outbreak of acute BVD, but diarrhea is not present in every animal that has acute BVD. The percentage of the herd exhibiting clinical disease and dying can vary extremely; however, if "secondary infections" are controlled, most animals survive the acute disease. This syndrome usually occurs in cattle 6 to 24 months of age. Acute Mucosal disease: An animal persistently infected with BVD virus is not able to mount any defense against becoming subsequently infected with a different BVD virus. When a BVD infection is superimposed on a PI animal, mucosal disease usually results. Acute mucosal disease is characterized by fever, profuse, watery diarrhea, erosions of the mouth, lack of appetite, discharge from the eyes and nose, and occasionally lameness. Secondary infections, such as pneumonia and mastitis, are common. Cattle with acute mucosal disease usually die within 3 to 10 days. Chronic Mucosal disease: Some cattle that develop mucosal disease do not die as soon as expected but rather become chronically infected. Cattle with chronic mucosal disease are poor doers, and may have persistently loose stools or intermittent diarrhea, chronic bloat, decreased appetite, weight loss, erosions between the claws, or non-healing skin lesions. Discharge from the eyes and nose, bald spots due to loss of hair, and long-term lameness are also common. Cattle with chronic mucosal disease rarely survive beyond 18 months and ultimately die. Treatment and Prevention of BVD infections There is no effective treatment for infection with BVD, but most cases are subclinical and self-limiting. Antibiotics, fluid and supportive therapy may be indicated to control secondary infections. Offering highly palatable feed could tempt sick animals to eat needed nutrients. Vaccination of susceptible cattle has been the principal approach to the prevention and control of BVD. However, preventing the introduction of BVD into your herd and identifying and eliminating PI animals from your herd are important steps to take to control the disease. Vaccinate calves: Calves should be vaccinated twice with a modified live virus (MLV) vaccine before leaving the herd of origin. Ideally, BVD vaccinations should be completed in the calves at least 30 days prior to weaning, but whatever program you initiate needs to fit with your management system. Check with your veterinarian for specific recommendations for your herd. Vaccinate the cow herd: It is difficult to provide blanket recommendations for vaccinating the cow herd, but some general guidelines can be given. Unvaccinated heifers and cows should be properly vaccinated before breeding to ensure protection for the fetus. All bulls should be properly vaccinated before putting them out with the cows or heifers and new additions should be properly vaccinated before adding them to the herd. Modified live virus vaccines can be safely used in open cows (there are new MLV vaccines safe for pregnant cows if the cows have been previously vaccinated with certain products) and provide long-lasting protection. Killed vaccines are safe for all cattle, but usually don’t provide as strong an immune response and may need more frequent booster vaccinations. Again, check with your veterinarian for specific recommendations. Prevent introduction of BVD into your herd: BVD virus is shed from cattle in the feces and in secretions from the nose and mouth. BVD is also readily transmitted by aerosol droplets and direct contact. Avoiding contact with other cattle is therefore an important step to take to prevent infection from entering your <b>herd.</b> “Good <b>fences</b> make good neighbors”. It is especially important to keep pregnant cows less than 120 days pregnant separated from other cattle. New introductions into your herd need to be tested for PI status. Eliminate PI animals from your herd: Until recently, testing cattle for PI infection was prohibitively expensive but now there are tools available making it feasible to test for and eliminate these “typhoid Mary” animals from the herd. There are two types of test available, one using a skin sample and one using a blood sample: Immunohistochemistry – for this test, a small notch of skin is taken from the edge of the ear, easily done using a pig ear-notching tool. The triangular piece of skin removed should be ¼ to ½ inches per side. Depending on the laboratory the sample will be sent to, the removed skin is placed either in a vial containing formalin or an individual plastic bag. All samples must be clearly labeled with the animals’ identification number. PCR – this test requires that a blood sample in a “purple top” tube be taken and submitted. Again, all samples must be clearly labeled with the individual animal ID. Samples can be sent to a number of different laboratories; three are listed below. Be sure to contact the lab and talk to your veterinarian before taking and sending samples – if you take the wrong samples, all your work may be wasted. Be aware that it is possible to have “false positive” results – some animals may test positive when they are not truly persistently infected, and may need to be re-tested. Your veterinarian can help interpret the results of the testing. (Thank you to Dr. John Maas for the following information) 1.
