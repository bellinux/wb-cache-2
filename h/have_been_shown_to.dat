5|$|A {{number of}} species of cacti <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> contain psychoactive agents, {{chemical}} compounds that can cause changes in mood, perception and cognition through their effects on the brain.

Both contain mescaline.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} at least three staging systems for cholangiocarcinoma (e.g. those of Bismuth, Blumgart, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer), none <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> be useful in {{predicting}} survival. The most important staging issue is whether the tumor can be surgically removed, or whether it is too advanced for surgical treatment to be successful. Often, this determination can only be made at the time of surgery.|$|E

5|$|Arranging a sleep {{environment}} that is quiet, very dark, and cool is recommended. Noises, light, and uncomfortable temperatures <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> disrupt continuous sleep. Other recommendations that are frequently made, though less studied, include selecting comfortable mattresses, bedding, and pillows, and eliminating a visible bedroom clock, to prevent focusing on time passing when trying to fall asleep.|$|E
5|$|Atypical {{antipsychotics}} are modestly {{useful in}} reducing aggression and psychosis {{in people with}} Alzheimer's disease, but their advantages are offset by serious adverse effects, such as stroke, movement difficulties or cognitive decline.

5|$|Aviary {{experiments}} {{conducted with}} captive flocks of scaly-breasted munia have tested whether producers and scroungers reach the predicted stable equilibrium frequency (see Evolutionarily stable strategy) when individuals {{are free to}} choose either behavior. The numbers choosing either producers and scrounger strategies <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> converge on stable frequencies while demonstrating that variation in tactics arise through frequency dependent pay-offs from the choice of different feeding strategies.|$|E

5|$|Early SEGRAs were {{synthetic}} steroids. An {{example is}} RU24858, {{one of the}} first compounds of this type to be published. Many newer SEGRAs have a different framework, although the similarity to steroids can still be seen in molecules like the benzopyranoquinoline A276575 or in octahydrophenanthrene-2,7-diol derivatives.

5|$|Established clearfelling {{practices}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> favour the Pindi moth, {{and could}} lead to it being considered a pest due to opportunistic proliferation of the species.

5|$|Extracts of {{the fruit}} body of Ramaria {{botrytis}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> favorably influence the growth and development of HeLa cells grown in tissue culture. The mushroom contains nicotianamine, an ACE inhibitor (angiotensin-converting enzyme). Nicotianamine is a metal-chelating compound essential in iron metabolism and utilization in plants. Several sterols have been isolated from the fruit bodies, 5α,6α-epoxy-3β-hydroxy-(22E)-ergosta-8(14),22-dien-7-one, ergosterol peroxide, cerevisterol, and 9α-hydroxycerevisterol, {{in addition to the}} previously unknown ceramide (2S,2R,3R,4E,8E)-N-2'-hydroxyoctadecanoyl-2-amino-9-methyl-4,8-heptade-cadiene-1,3-diol.|$|E

5|$|In {{laboratory}} experiments, extracts of I. badia fruit bodies <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> {{have significant}} antioxidative properties in vitro. Fruit bodies contain the compound theanine, an amino acid and a glutamic acid analogue found in green tea. Efforts {{have been made}} to establish a protocol for producing theanine by growing the fungus mycelium using submerged fermentation. Several indole compounds have been detected in fruit bodies. Unprocessed mushrooms contain tryptophan (0.68mg per 100g dry weight), tryptamine (0.47), serotonin (0.52), kynurenine sulphate (1.96), and kynurenic acid (1.57). Due to their temperature sensitivity, cooking significantly changes the contents and composition of indole compounds: cooked mushrooms contained tryptophan (1.74mg/100g dw), 5-methyltryptophan (6.55), melatonin (0.71), and indoleacetonitrile (2.07). Fruit body extracts <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> slow the growth of certain tumour cell lines in cell culture.|$|E
