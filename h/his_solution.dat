5|$|The {{request for}} a new bombsight was quickly {{passed on to the}} Royal Aircraft Establishment, where Patrick Blackett of the Aeronautical Research Committee volunteered to lead the effort. <b>His</b> <b>solution</b> to the problem was a {{thorough}} revision of the CSBS concept.|$|E
5|$|Halkett was {{an amateur}} inventor, and during {{his spare time}} whilst serving in the navy he worked on solving {{the problem of how}} to design a boat that would be small and light enough to {{transport}} easily on foot through wilderness, but robust enough to carry people in safety across wide bodies of water. <b>His</b> <b>solution</b> was to design a boat in which all components would double as items of clothing, or accessories that Halkett assumed the user would be carrying in any event.|$|E
5|$|In {{his second}} year, Gates devised an {{algorithm}} for pancake sorting {{as a solution}} to {{one of a series of}} unsolved problems presented in a combinatorics class by Harry Lewis, one of his professors. Gates's solution held the record as the fastest version for over thirty years; its successor is faster by only one percent. <b>His</b> <b>solution</b> was later formalized in a published paper in collaboration with Harvard computer scientist Christos Papadimitriou.|$|E
5000|$|According to Glen Van Brummelen, [...] "The Law of Sines {{is really}} Regiomontanus's {{foundation}} for <b>his</b> <b>solutions</b> of right-angled triangles in Book IV, and these solutions are in turn the bases for <b>his</b> <b>solutions</b> of general triangles." [...] Regiomontanus was a 15th-century German mathematician.|$|R

40|$|Several {{commentators}} {{make the}} claim that Augustine is not a systematic thinker. The purpose of this thesis is to refute that claim in one specific area of Augustine 2 ̆ 7 s thought, the metaphysical foundations underlying <b>his</b> <b>solutions</b> {{to the problem of}} evil. Through an exegetical examination of various works in which Augustine writes on evil, I show that <b>his</b> <b>solutions</b> for both natural and moral evil rely on a coherent metaphysical system, conceived of and expounded upon within a Platonically influenced Christian context...|$|R
5|$|Apollonius' {{problem has}} other applications. In Book 1, Proposition 21 in his Principia, Isaac Newton used <b>his</b> <b>solution</b> of Apollonius' problem to {{construct}} an orbit in celestial mechanics {{from the center of}} attraction and observations of tangent lines to the orbit corresponding to instantaneous velocity. The special case of the problem of Apollonius when all three circles are tangent is used in the Hardy–Littlewood circle method of analytic number theory to construct Hans Rademacher's contour for complex integration, given by the boundaries of an infinite set of Ford circles each of which touches several others. Finally, Apollonius' problem has been applied to some types of packing problems, which arise in disparate fields such as the error-correcting codes used on DVDs and the design of pharmaceuticals that bind in a particular enzyme of a pathogenic bacterium.|$|E
5|$|A foam is {{a mass of}} bubbles; foams of {{different}} materials occur in nature. Foams composed of soap films obey Plateau's laws, which require three soap films to meet at each edge at 120° and four soap edges to meet at each vertex at the tetrahedral angle of about 109.5°. Plateau's laws further require films to be smooth and continuous, {{and to have a}} constant average curvature at every point. For example, a film may remain nearly flat on average by being curved up in one direction (say, left to right) while being curved downwards in another direction (say, front to back). Structures with minimal surfaces can be used as tents. Lord Kelvin identified the problem of {{the most efficient way to}} pack cells of equal volume as a foam in 1887; <b>his</b> <b>solution</b> uses just one solid, the bitruncated cubic honeycomb with very slightly curved faces to meet Plateau's laws. No better solution was found until 1993 when Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan proposed the Weaire–Phelan structure; the Beijing National Aquatics Center adapted the structure for their outer wall in the 2008 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|However, South Vietnamese {{officers}} were often reluctant to absorb heavy casualties. On several occasions, Cao's forces {{were in an}} excellent position to trap and wipe out whole battalions of Viet Cong, but he would fail to close the trap on one pretext or another and allow the enemy to escape. This behavior initially mystified Vann, who was attempting to build Cao into an aggressive commander. Unknown to Vann, Diem would reprimand or demote any officer who lost too many men, no matter how successful the operation. Diem {{was more interested in}} using the military to protect his regime than to take on the Viet Cong. <b>His</b> <b>solution</b> was to fill the ARVN with Catholic political cronies and friends like Cao, Lê Quang Tung, and Tôn Thất Đính, who had little military ability, but were very likely to help stop a coup attempt. After a skirmish on a highway that resulted in a small number of South Vietnamese casualties along with several trucks destroyed, Cao was called to Saigon and reprimanded by Diem. Upon his return, Vann and his group of advisers were forced to end the joint planning sessions that had been so successful earlier, and action essentially wound down in their region. Cao used the excellent military intelligence network they had developed to find areas devoid of the Viet Cong, and planned operations only in those areas. In many other cases, operations were executed on paper only, in order to report an increasing tempo of operations that did not actually exist.|$|E

5|$|Modern DST {{was first}} {{proposed}} by the New Zealand entomologist George Hudson, whose shift work job gave him leisure time to collect insects and led him to value after-hours daylight. In 1895 he presented a paper to the Wellington Philosophical Society proposing a two-hour daylight-saving shift, and after considerable interest was expressed in Christchurch, he followed up in an 1898 paper. Many publications credit DST proposal to the prominent English builder and outdoorsman William Willett, who independently conceived DST in 1905 during a pre-breakfast ride, when he observed with dismay how many Londoners slept through {{a large part of}} a summer day. An avid golfer, he also disliked cutting short his round at dusk. <b>His</b> <b>solution</b> was to advance the clock during the summer months, a proposal he published two years later. The proposal was taken up by the Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) Robert Pearce, who introduced the first Daylight Saving Bill to the House of Commons on February 12, 1908. A select committee was set up to examine the issue, but Pearce's bill did not become law, and several other bills failed in the following years. Willett lobbied for the proposal in the UK until his death in 1915.|$|E

25|$|The quintic {{was almost}} proven {{to have no}} general {{solutions}} by radicals by Paolo Ruffini in 1799, whose key insight was to use permutation groups, not just a single permutation. <b>His</b> <b>solution</b> contained a gap, which Cauchy considered minor, though this was not patched until the work of Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel, who published a proof in 1824, thus establishing the Abel–Ruffini theorem.|$|E

25|$|Albrecht Heeffer {{investigated}} Menzies' {{claim that}} Regiomontanus based <b>his</b> <b>solution</b> to the Chinese remainder theorem on the Chinese work Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections from 1247. He {{arrived at the}} conclusion that the solution method does not depend on this text but on the earlier Sunzi Suanjing as does the treatment of a similar problem by Fibonacci which predates the Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections. Furthermore, Regiomontanus could rely on practices with remainder tables from the abacus tradition.|$|E
25|$|Several {{papers were}} {{inspired}} by a question of M.
