5|$|In the {{northern}} part of the constellation to the northwest of the Pleiades lies the Crystal Ball Nebula, <b>known</b> <b>by</b> <b>its</b> catalogue designation of NGC 1514.

However, Herschel could clearly resolve a star at the center of the nebula that was surrounded by a nebulous cloud of some type. In 1864, English astronomer William Huggins used the spectrum of this nebula to deduce that the nebula is a luminous gas, rather than stars.|$|E

It is dressed in the same manner, and served usually with the same sauces as a turbot, but requires less time to boil it. The fins should be cut off before it is cooked.|$|E
