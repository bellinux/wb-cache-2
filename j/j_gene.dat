5|$|Somatic {{recombination}} of immunoglobulins, {{also known}} as V(D)J recombination, involves the generation of a unique immunoglobulin variable region. The variable region of each immunoglobulin heavy or light chain is encoded in several pieces—known as gene segments (subgenes). These segments are called variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) segments. V, D and J segments are found in Ig heavy chains, but only V and J segments are found in Ig light chains. Multiple copies of the V, D and <b>J</b> <b>gene</b> segments exist, and are tandemly arranged in the genomes of mammals. In the bone marrow, each developing B cell will assemble an immunoglobulin variable region by randomly selecting and combining one V, one D and one <b>J</b> <b>gene</b> segment (or one V and one J segment in the light chain). As there are multiple copies of each type of gene segment, and different combinations of gene segments {{can be used to}} generate each immunoglobulin variable region, this process generates a huge number of antibodies, each with different , and thus different antigen specificities. Interestingly, the rearrangement of several subgenes (i.e. V2 family) for lambda light chain immunoglobulin is coupled with the activation of microRNA miR-650, which further influences biology of B-cells.|$|E

40|$|International audienceLymphocytes of {{the immune}} system ensure the body defense by the {{expression}} of receptors which are specific of targets, termed antigens. Each lymphocyte, deriving from the same original clone, expresses the same unique receptor. To achieve the production of receptors covering the wide variety of antigens, lymphocytes use a specialized genetic mechanism consisting of gene rearrangements. For instance, the genes encoding the receptor of the alpha chain of the T lymphocyte receptor (TRA) spread over a 1500 Kb genetic region which includes around 100 V <b>genes,</b> 60 <b>J</b> <b>genes,</b> and a single C gene. To constitute a functional alpha chain, one of the V and one of the <b>J</b> <b>genes</b> rearrange together to form a single exon. The precise definition of these V-J combinations is essential to understand the repertoire of TRA. We have developed a numerical model simulating all of the V-J combinations of TRA, fitting the available experimental observations obtained from the analysis of TRA in T lymphocytes of the thymus and the blood.

We have addressed this issue by building a model able to account for Va-Ja gene rearrangements during thymus development of mice. So we developed a numerical model on the whole TRA/TRD locus, based on experimental data, to estimate how Va and Ja genes become accessible to rearrangements. The progressive opening of the locus to V-J gene recombinations is modeled through windows of accessibility of different sizes and with different speeds of progression. Furthermore, the possibility of successive secondary V-J rearrangements was included in the modelling. The model points out some unbalanced V-J associations resulting from a preferential access to gene rearrangements and from a non-uniform partition of the accessibility of the <b>J</b> <b>genes,</b> depending on their location in the locus. The model shows that 3 to 4 successive rearrangements are sufficient to explain the use of all the V and <b>J</b> <b>genes</b> of the locus.

Further analyses of the enhancer in the IL- 2 –responsive presecretor BCL 1 cells showed that the enhancer is activated at this stage by an IL- 2 signal that functions by opening the enhancer chromatin and stimulating STAT 5 to bind to a STAT 5 element critical for the enhancer induction.

Although these signal joints are allegedly invariant, created by the head-to-head abuttal of the heptamers, some do exhibit junctional diversity. Recombination signals were initially identified by comparison and alignment of germ-line sequences with the sequence of rearranged genes. However, their overall low level of sequence conservation makes their characterization solely from sequence data difficult. Recently, computational analysis unraveled correlations between nucleotides at several positions scattered within the spacer and recombination activity, so that it is now possible to identify putative recombination signals and determine and predict their recombination efficiency. In this paper, we analyzed the variability introduced in signal joints generated after rearrangement of the TRDD 1 and TRDD 2 genes in murine thymocytes. The recurrent presence of identical nucleotides inserted in these signal joints led us to reconsider the location and sequence of the TRDD 1 recombination signal. By combining molecular characterization and computational analysis, we show that the functional TRDD 1 recombination signal is shifted inside the putative coding sequence of the TRDD 1 gene and, consequently, that this gene is shorter than indicated in the databases...|$|R

50|$|In {{studying}} {{the development of}} the avian immune system, the embryo offers several advantages such as the availability of many embryos at precise stages of development and distinct B and T cell systems. Each population differentiates from a primary lymphoid organ: T cells in the thymus and B cells in the Bursa of Fabricius. Research has found that early feeding of hydrated nutritional supplements in chickens heavily affects the immune system development. This is often measured by weight of the Bursa of Fabricius, improved resistance to disease and earlier appearance of IgA.Unlike other animals, newly hatched chicks are born with an incomplete immune system. Here, the amniotic fluid and yolk of the egg contain the maternal immunity to be passed on to the hatchling. Swallowing of the amniotic fluid during hatching confers immunity to these chicks until their immune system develops fully. In the first six weeks of the bird’s life, continuous gene conversion in the bursa completes the immune system. Upon hatch, birds do not have a library of genetic information for B cells to use for antibody production. Instead, B cells mature in the bursa during the first six weeks and then go on to seed other organs of the immune system. As a result, birds are highly susceptible to pathogens in the first few weeks after hatching. Research found that T cells from mature chickens proliferated extensively and produced high levels of IL-2 and other cytokines. On the other hand, T cells from 24 hour-old chickens failed to proliferate and could not secrete cytokines.Gene conversion within the bursa leads to the development of antibodies that are diverse in their recognition ability. Mammalian V, D and <b>J</b> <b>gene</b> segments allow for many combinations and therefore, yield a vast repertoire of antibodies. However, birds have only a single functional copy of the VL and JL genes for the Ig light chain and a single functional copy of the VH and JH heavy chain genes. This results in a low diversity from gene rearrangements of Ig heavy and light chains. However, clusters of pseudogenes upstream of the heavy and light gene Ig loci take part in somatic gene conversion - a process where pseudogenes replace the VH and VL genes. This diversifies the repertoire of bird antibodies.|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} why somatic mutations are spatially {{restricted to}} a region around the rearranged V(D) J immunoglobulin gene, {{we compared the}} distribution of mutations flanking murine V gene segments that had rearranged next to either proximal or distal <b>J</b> <b>gene</b> segments. 124 nucleotide substitutions, nine deletions, and two insertions were identified in 32, 481 bp of DNA flanking the coding regions from 17 heavy and kappa light chain genes. Most of the mutations occurred within a 2 -kb region centered around the V(D) <b>J</b> <b>gene,</b> regardless of which <b>J</b> <b>gene</b> segment was used, suggesting that the structural information for mutation is located in sequences around and within the V(D) <b>J</b> <b>gene,</b> and not in sequences downstream of the <b>J</b> <b>gene</b> segments. The majority of mutations were found within 300 bp of DNA flanking the 5 ' side of the V(D) <b>J</b> <b>gene</b> and 850 bp flanking the 3 ' side at a frequency of 0. 8 %, which {{was similar to the}} frequency in the coding region. The frequency of flanking mutations decreased as a function of distance from the gene. There was no evidence for hot spots in that every mutation was unique and occurred at a different position. No mutations were found upstream of the promoter region, suggesting that the promoter delimits a 5 ' boundary, which provides strong evidence that transcription is necessary to generate mutation. The 3 ' boundary was approximately 1 kb from the V(D) <b>J</b> <b>gene</b> and was not associated with a DNA sequence motif. Occasional mutations were located in the nuclear matrix association and enhancer regions. The pattern of substitutions suggests that there is discrimination between the two DNA strands during mutation, in that the four bases were mutated with different frequencies on each strand. The high frequency of mutations in the 3 ' flanking region and the uniqueness of each mutation argues against templated gene conversion as a mechanism for generating somatic diversity in murine V(D) J genes. Rather, the data support a model for random point mutations where the mechanism is linked to the transcriptional state of the gene...|$|E

It identifies the closest variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (<b>J)</b> <b>genes</b> and alleles, delimits the framework regions (FR-IMGT) and complementarity determining regions (CDR-IMGT) according to the IMGT unique numbering and localizes the V-GENE mutations in the user sequences. IMGT/V-QUEST includes IMGT/JunctionAnalysis for the analysis of the JUNCTION(s) ...|$|R
40|$|B cells {{rely on a}} broad {{receptor}} repertoire {{to provide}} protection against {{a wide range of}} pathogens. This is in part achieved through V(D) J recombination, which, by assembling various combinations of variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (<b>J)</b> <b>genes,</b> creates different IgV regions. 1 The recombination processes is initiated by recombination-activating gene (RAG) 1 /RAG 2 enzymes and requires a functional nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) machinery. B cells can further diversify their IgV regions through somatic hypermutation (SHM) to improve affinity between the antibody and antigen and switch the isotype of antibody produced by class-switch recombination (CSR) ...|$|R
