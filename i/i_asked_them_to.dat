The British and the Americans were less enthusiastic about Dmowski's National Committee, but likewise recognized it as Poland's government a year later.

2500|$|Upon {{receiving}} orders, General Scott {{traveled all}} the way from his post in Virginia City to Bluff, in order to negotiate an end to the war. Scott was genuinely uninterested in fighting the hostile Utes and Paiutes, so on March 10, 1915 he left Bluff, unarmed, with just a few of his men, to meet Polk and Posey at a place called Mexican Hat, near Navajo Mountain. General Scott described the journey; [...] "We reached Bluff on March 10 and learned that the Indians had gone to the Navajo Mountains, 125 miles southwest of Bluff. We stayed a day in Bluff and then went on to Mexican Hat. Some friendly Navajos met me at Mexican Hat and went ahead of me to tell Poke's [...] band of my coming. Among them was Bzoshe, the old Navajo chief with whom the government had so much trouble with a year ago and who is now our fast friend. I had sent for him to meet me at Bluff. Mr. Jenkins, Indian agent at Navajo Springs, Mr. Creel, Colonel Michie, and my orderly accompanied me to Mexican Hat. None of us had a gun. Jim Boy, a friendly Paiute, was sent out to tell the Paiutes that I wanted to see them. Some of them came near where I was camped, but it wasn't until the third day that anyone dared to come to the camp. Posey and four other Indians then came in. We talked a little through a Navajo interpreter. It was in the evening, and I just asked them how they were. I told them I did not feel very well {{and did not want to}} talk to them until the next day. They helped us kill a beef and we gave them a good meal, the first they'd had in weeks. We also gave them some blankets. Posey and his men didn't have any weapons, but I have reason to suspect that they had hidden them nearby. The next day, Poke and Hatch [...] and about 25 others came to see me. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> tell me their troubles. I said that I didn't think they would like to have their children chased by soldiers and cowboys all over the mountains and killed and that I wanted to help them. I didn't try to push the matter with them, but asked them what they wanted to do. After they had talked among themselves, they said they would do anything I wanted them to do." ...|$|E

Students begin by reading together Kabat-Zinn’s chapter Going Up Stairs (Kabat-Zinn 1994). In this chapter, he describes his own experience of feeling, “frequently pulled by my need to be somewhere else” and challenges this pull by asking, “why does your response time have to be so fast that it pulls you out of the life you were living in the preceding moment” (Kabat-Zinn 1994, 201 - 203). Like Kabat-Zinn, <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> consider if their transition between steps could be more graceful, whether they can pause <b>to</b> look around <b>them,</b> and <b>to</b> notice where their torso is in relation to their head, legs and feet as they step up or down. They then are divided up and asked to watch other students as they ascend and descend the numerous staircases around the building.

30|$|For example, on {{the first}} day of the {{freshman}} seminar each student is asked to sit comfortably supported by their chair. With their eyes closed they are asked to become aware of their feet on the floor, their breath, the sensation of air moving through the room, the rough or smooth fabric of their clothing as they touch the surface of their jeans, or instead to hold the hem of their shirt. Once they have settled into the meditation, <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> attend to their breath more intently. <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> notice the movement in the torso as the breath moves in and out, visualize the diaphragm as it encourages air flow, and consciously take a deep breath noticing how the rhythm of the breath returns to normal. Students are prompted to use their sensory capacities to feel the temperature of the air or observe the nostrils or the mouth as the air passes in and out. At the same time, I introduce the idea of awareness, <b>asking</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> refrain from judgment and distraction. Instead I encourage daydreaming about the breath, wondering about how it sounds or waiting for ideas that might emerge from their imagination. Sven Birkerts in his book, Changing the Subject: Art and Attention in the Age of the Internet (Birkerts 2015), describes distraction as “shearing away from focus” while daydreaming is honored as “the very emblem of the soul’s freedom”. He compares the two by defining distraction as “a lowering of intensity” in contrast to daydreaming where, “the word itself conveys immersed intensity” bringing it “closer to our experience of art” (Birkerts 2015, 248).|$|R

A departure from custom--that settled it; it was a nation capable of committing any crime but that. The servants said they would follow the fashion, a fashion grown sacred through immemorial observance; they would scatter fresh rushes in all the rooms and halls, and then the evidence of the aristocratic visitation would be no longer visible. It was a kind of satire on Nature: it was the scientific method, the geologic method; it deposited the history of the family in a stratified record; and the antiquary could dig through it and tell by the remains of each period what changes of diet the family had introduced successively for a hundred years.|$|E

Questioned why, she gravely said that if you weren't married people called you an old maid, and if you were your husband bossed you; but if you were a widow there'd be no danger of either. The most remarkable wish was Sally Bell's. She wanted a 'honeymoon.'

The more dreary it is and the more fearful the subject, the more {{they think it is}} what it ought to be. They have an idea {{this is the way to}} make New York society intellectual. There's a sumptuary law--isn't that what you call it?--about suppers, and they restrict themselves to a kind of Spartan broth. When it's made by their French cooks it isn't bad. Mrs. Burrage is one of the principal members--one of the founders, I believe; and when her turn has come round, formerly--it comes only once in the winter for each--I am told she has usually had very good music. But that is thought rather a base evasion, a begging of the question; the vulgar set can easily keep up with them on music. So Mrs. Burrage conceived the extraordinary idea"--and it was wonderful to hear how Mrs. Luna pronounced that adjective--"of sending on to Boston for that girl. It was her son, of course, who put it into her head; he has been at Cambridge for some years--that's where Verena lived, you know--and he was as thick with her as you please out there. Now that he is no longer there it suits him very well to have her here. She is coming on a visit to his mother when Olive goes. <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> stay with me, but Olive declined, majestically; she said they wished to be in some place where they would be free to receive 'sympathising friends.' So they are staying at some extraordinary kind of New Jerusalem boarding-house, in Tenth Street; Olive thinks it's her duty to go to such places. I was greatly surprised that she should let Verena be drawn into such a worldly crowd as this; but she told me they had made up their minds not to let any occasion slip, that they could sow the seed of truth in drawing-rooms as well as in workshops, and that if a single person was brought round to their ideas they should have been justified in coming on. That's what they are doing in there--sowing the seed; but you shall not be the one that's brought round, I shall take care of that. Have you seen my delightful sister yet? The way she does arrange herself when she wants to protest against frills! She looks as if she thought it pretty barren ground round here, now she has come to see it. I don't think she thinks you can be saved in a French dress, anyhow. I must say I call it a very base evasion of Mrs. Burrage's, producing Verena Tarrant; it's worse than the meretricious music. Why didn't she honestly send for a ballerina from Niblo's--if she wanted a young woman capering about on a platform? They don't care a fig about poor Olive's ideas; it's only because Verena has strange hair, and shiny eyes, and gets herself up like a prestidigitator's assistant. I have never understood how Olive can reconcile herself to Verena's really low style of dress. I suppose it's only because her clothes are so fearfully made. You look as if you didn't believe me--but I assure you that the cut is revolutionary; and that's a salve to Olive's conscience." ...|$|E
