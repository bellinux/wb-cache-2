50|$|Leporids are {{typically}} polygynandrous, and have highly developed social systems. Their social hierarchies determine which males mate when the females go into estrus, which happens throughout the year. <b>Gestation</b> <b>periods</b> are variable, but in general, higher latitudes correspond to shorter <b>gestation</b> <b>periods.</b> Moreover, the <b>gestation</b> time and litter size correspond to predation rates as well. Species nesting below ground {{tend to have}} lower predation rates and have larger litters.|$|R
5|$|Like other requiem sharks, {{the nervous}} shark is viviparous: once the embryos exhaust their initial supply of yolk, they are {{provisioned}} {{by the mother}} through a placental connection formed from the depleted yolk sac. Adult females have a single functional ovary, on the right, and two functional uteruses. The male bites {{at the sides of}} the female as a prelude to mating. After mating, the female stores the sperm for approximately four weeks prior to fertilization. In Darwin Harbor, mating occurs from January to March and birthing occurs in October and November following a <b>gestation</b> <b>period</b> of eight to nine months. In Shark Bay, mating occurs from late October to early November and birthing occurs around the same time the following year, following a <b>gestation</b> <b>period</b> of 11 months; this slower development likely reflects the cooler temperatures of Shark Bay.|$|E
5|$|Pairs {{separate}} after mating, {{and females}} provide all parenting. The <b>gestation</b> <b>period</b> lasts 93–105 days; females {{give birth to}} up to four cubs, and most commonly to two. The mother will not tolerate the presence of males {{after the birth of}} cubs, given a risk of infanticide; this behavior is also found in the tiger.|$|E
5|$|Relatively {{inactive}} during daytime, the sparsely-spotted stingaree preys {{mainly on}} crustaceans, {{and to a}} much lesser extent on polychaete worms and other small benthic organisms. It is aplacental viviparous, with the mother provisioning her young with histotroph ("uterine milk"). Life history differs between the eastern and western subpopulations: eastern females bear litters of up to six pups with a twelve-month <b>gestation</b> <b>period,</b> while western females bear litters of {{only one or two}} pups with a ten-month <b>gestation</b> <b>period.</b> Also, western rays mature later and live longer than eastern rays. The venomous sting of the sparsely-spotted stingaree is potentially injurious to humans, and it has been reported to react aggressively if disturbed. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it under Least Concern, as there is little fishing activity over the majority of its range.|$|E
50|$|The {{duration}} of gestation in placental mammals varies from 18 days in jumping mice to 23 months in elephants. Generally speaking, fetuses of larger land mammals require longer <b>gestation</b> <b>periods.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{gray whale}} {{has been placed}} {{in a family of}} its own as it is {{sufficiently}} different from the right whales and the rorquals. The gray whale is the only benthic feeding baleen whale, filtering small organisms from the mud of shallow seas. They also have a <b>gestation</b> <b>period</b> of over a year, which is unusual for baleen whales.|$|E
5|$|The {{guinea pig}} {{is able to}} breed year-round, with birth peaks usually coming in the spring; {{as many as five}} litters can be {{produced}} per year. The <b>gestation</b> <b>period</b> lasts from 59–72 days, with an average of 63–68 days. Because of the long <b>gestation</b> <b>period</b> and the large size of the pups, pregnant females may become large and eggplant-shaped, although the change in size and shape varies. Unlike the offspring of most other rodents, which are altricial at birth, newborn pups are well-developed with hair, teeth, claws, and partial eyesight; they are immediately mobile, and begin eating solid food immediately, though they continue to suckle. Litters yield one to six pups, with an average of three; the largest recorded litter size is 17. The guinea pig mother only has two nipples, but she can readily raise the more average-sized litters of 2 to 4 piglets.|$|E
5|$|Active {{during the}} night, Transandinomys talamancae {{lives on the}} ground and eats plants and insects. Males move more and have larger home ranges than females. It breeds {{throughout}} the year, but few individuals survive for more than a year. After a <b>gestation</b> <b>period</b> of about 28 days, two to five young are born, which reach sexual maturity within two months. A variety of parasites occur on this species. Widespread and common, it is of no conservation concern.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gestation</b> <b>periods</b> last around 30 {{days and}} young {{have an average}} body length between 10-11 grams, with litters as small as 1 {{offspring}} and as large as 7. Males are generally absent when raising the altricial young, so the female is responsible for feeding and caring for their young.|$|R
5|$|After mating, sheep have a <b>gestation</b> <b>period</b> {{of about}} five months, and normal labor takes one to three hours. Although some breeds {{regularly}} throw larger litters of lambs, most produce single or twin lambs. During or soon after labor, ewes and lambs may be confined to small lambing jugs, small pens designed to aid both careful observation of ewes and to cement the bond between them and their lambs.|$|E
5|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} {{at the age}} of six to seven years, while males become sexually mature at about 10 years old. The <b>gestation</b> <b>period</b> is around 15–16 months. The calf, which {{typically}} weighs , is weaned after about 15 months and stays with its mother for the first two to three years of its life. In the wild, the birth interval for this species is estimated to be four to five years; its natural offspring-rearing behavior is unstudied.|$|E
5|$|In captivity, females become {{sexually mature}} at {{two months of}} age. The ovarian {{follicle}} forms about 16 days prior {{to the birth of}} the offspring. After mating, female hamsters typically have larger uteri, ovaries, and adrenal glands compared to females which live alone, with other females or those that have not mated. The females and males may fight each other when getting to know their partner. Also, these females have a shorter <b>gestation</b> <b>period,</b> around four to five days.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the dynamic behavior under financial sophistication in a Diamond’s overlapping generations model with money. Financial sophistica-tion {{is referred to}} as development of financial markets that enable illiquid assets tradable. Two technologies of capital production with differing <b>gestation</b> <b>periods</b> are introduced. For the technology with longer <b>gestation</b> <b>periods</b> to be employed, capital in progress needs to be tradable in secondary capital markets from agents’life cycles. Under financial sophistication, that technology can be employed. In the standard Diamond model with money, adjustment behavior toward the uniquely existed steady state where money is positively valued is saddle-stable and monotone under perfect foresight. This paper shows that it is also saddle-stable. But due to financial sophistication,it is oscillatory. Thus,the presence of money itself is not a source of economic oscillation but financial sophistication is...|$|R
40|$|The {{longitudinal}} study assessed {{the psychological and}} educational sequelae of premature birth through the early elementary school years, to determine whether children born prematurely constitute a high risk population in terms of regular school progress.

50|$|Generally, even-toed {{ungulates}} {{tend to have}} long <b>gestation</b> <b>periods,</b> smaller litter sizes, and more highly developed newborns. As with many other mammals, species in temperate or polar regions have a fixed mating season, while those in tropical areas breed year-round. They carry out polygynous mating behavior, meaning a male mates with several females and suppresses all competition.|$|R
5|$|Often found {{lying on}} the bottom buried in sediment, the roughtail {{stingray}} is a generalist predator that feeds {{on a variety of}} benthic invertebrates and bony fishes. It is aplacental viviparous, with the embryos receiving nourishment initially from yolk, and later from histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. In the northwestern Atlantic, females bear an annual litter of 4–6 young in fall and early winter, after a <b>gestation</b> <b>period</b> of 9–11 months. By contrast, in the Mediterranean there is evidence that females bear two litters of 2–6 young per year after a <b>gestation</b> <b>period</b> of only four months. Rays in the northwestern Atlantic are also larger at birth and at sexual maturity than those from the Mediterranean. The venomous tail spine of the roughtail stingray is potentially dangerous to humans. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern overall and in the northwestern Atlantic, where it is not commercially utilized. However, in the Mediterranean and southwestern Atlantic it is subject to heavy fishing pressure and has been assessed as Near Threatened.|$|E
5|$|Pilot whales {{have one}} of the longest birth {{intervals}} of the cetaceans, calving once every three to five years. Most matings and calvings occur during the summer for long-finned pilot whales. For short-finned pilot whales of the Southern Hemisphere, births are at their highest in spring and autumn, while in Northern Hemisphere, the time in which calving peaks can vary by population. For long-finned pilot whales, gestation lasts 12–16 months, and short-finned pilot whales have a 15-month <b>gestation</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E
5|$|The least weasel mates in April–July {{and there}} is a 34- to 37-day <b>gestation</b> <b>period.</b> In the Northern Hemisphere, the average litter size {{consists}} of 6 kits and these reach sexual maturity in 3 to 4 months. Males may mate during their first year of life, though this is usually unsuccessful. They are fecund in February–October, though the early stages of spermatogenesis do occur throughout the winter months. Anestrus in females lasts from September until February.|$|E
50|$|With {{regard to}} the fetal {{presentation}} during human <b>gestation,</b> three <b>periods</b> have been distinguished.|$|R
25|$|<b>Gestation</b> <b>periods</b> {{are about}} 120 days, and young are born precocial. Newborns grow quickly, and reach full adult body weight after about 10–13 weeks, and will usually leave the parental harem after about 16 weeks. All females will reach sexual {{maturity}} {{by the time}} they're one year old, and males will reach sexual maturity within {{the first two years}} of being born.|$|R
50|$|The {{species are}} parthenogenetic, since they consist of mostly females. The females give birth in 3 months, with the period being {{as long as}} 4-5 months. Various <b>{{gestation}}</b> <b>periods</b> are different, and can take maximum from 9-12 months. The gestation can be shortened if the temperature is warm enough. The brood size is from 2-16, {{with an average of}} 8.|$|R
5|$|The {{lineup of}} the live band had a {{tendency}} to change drastically between major tours: aside from Reznor remaining on lead vocals, keyboards and guitar, no member of the live band had remained constant since its inception.

5|$|Very {{little is}} known of the Mediterranean monk seal's reproduction. It is {{suggested}} that they are polygynous, with males being very territorial where they mate with females. Although there is no breeding season since births take place year round, there is a peak in October and November. This is also the time when caves are prone to wash out due to high surf or storm surge, which causes high mortality rates among monk seal pups, especially at the key Cabo Blanco colony. Pups make first contact with the water two weeks after their birth and are weaned at around 18 weeks of age; females caring for pups will go off to feed {{for an average of}} nine hours. Most individuals are believed to reach maturity at four years of age. The <b>gestation</b> <b>period</b> lasts close to a year. However, it is believed to be common among monk seals of the Cabo Blanco colony to have a <b>gestation</b> <b>period</b> lasting slightly longer than a year. Mediterranean monk seals generally live to be 25 to 30 years old.|$|E
5|$|Active-swimming predators, {{groups of}} leopard sharks often follow the tide onto {{intertidal}} mudflats to forage for food, mainly clams, spoon worms, crabs, shrimp, bony fish, and fish eggs. Most leopard sharks tend to remain {{within a particular}} area rather than undertaking long movements elsewhere, {{which has led to}} genetic divergence between populations of sharks living in different regions. This species is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the young hatch inside the uterus and are nourished by yolk. From March to June, the female gives birth to as many as 37 young after a <b>gestation</b> <b>period</b> of 10–12 months. It is relatively slow-growing and takes many years to mature.|$|E
40|$|Disturbance {{to early}} brain {{development}} is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders including autism, schizophrenia, and mental retardation. Epidemiological {{studies have indicated}} that the risk of developing these disorders is enhanced by prenatal maternal infection, presumably as a result of neurodevelopmental defects triggered by cytokine-related inflammatory events. Here, we demonstrate that the effects of maternal immune challenge between middle and late <b>gestation</b> <b>periods</b> in mice are dissociable in terms of fetal brain cytokine responses to maternal inflammation and the pathological consequences in brain and behavior. Specifically, the relative expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the fetal brains in response to maternal immune challenge may be an important determinant among other developmental factors for the precise pathological profile emerging in later life. Thus, the middle and late <b>gestation</b> <b>periods</b> correspond to two windows with differing vulnerability to adult behavioral dysfunction, brain neuropathology in early adolescence, and of the acute cytokine responses in the fetal brain...|$|R
50|$|F1 {{generation}} Savannahs {{are very}} difficult to produce, due to the significant difference in <b>gestation</b> <b>periods</b> between the serval and a domestic cat (75 days for a serval and 65 days for a domestic cat), and sex chromosomes.

50|$|Female shrews {{can have}} up to 10 litters a year; in the tropics, they breed all year round; in {{temperate}} zones, they only stop breeding in the winter. Shrews have <b>gestation</b> <b>periods</b> of 17-32 days. The female often becomes pregnant {{within a day or}} so of giving birth, and lactates during her pregnancy, weaning one litter as the next is born. Shrews live 12 to 30 months.|$|R
