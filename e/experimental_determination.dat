5|$|The <b>experimental</b> <b>determination</b> of pKa {{values is}} {{commonly}} performed {{by means of}} titrations, in a medium of high ionic strength and at constant temperature. A typical procedure would be as follows. A solution of the compound in the medium is acidified with a strong acid {{to the point where}} the compound is fully protonated. The solution is then titrated with a strong base until all the protons have been removed. At each point in the titration pH is measured using a glass electrode and a pH meter. The equilibrium constants are found by fitting calculated pH values to the observed values, using the method of least squares.|$|E

40|$|Although {{reliable}} {{determination of}} the molecular dipole moment from experimental charge density analyses on molecular crystals is a challenging undertaking, these values are becoming increasingly common experimental results. We collate all known <b>experimental</b> <b>determinations</b> and use this database to identify broad trends in the dipole moment enhancements implied by these measurements as well as outliers for which enhancements are pronounced. Compelling evidence emerges that molecular dipole moments from X-ray diffraction data can provide {{a wealth of information}} on the change in the molecular charge distribution that results from crystal formation. Most importantly, these experiments are unrivalled in their potential to provide this information in such detail and deserve to be exploited to a much greater extent. The considerable number of <b>experimental</b> <b>determinations</b> now available has enabled us to pinpoint those studies that merit further attention, either because they point unequivocally to a considerable enhancement in the crystal (of 50 % or more), or because the <b>experimental</b> <b>determinations</b> suggest enhancements of 100 % or more [...] much larger than independent theoretical estimates. In both cases further detailed experimental and theoretical studies are indicated...|$|R
25|$|The {{second part}} of Einstein's theory relates the {{diffusion}} constant to physically measurable quantities, such as the mean squared displacement of a particle in a given time interval. This result enables the <b>experimental</b> <b>determination</b> of Avogadro's number and therefore the size of molecules. Einstein analyzed a dynamic equilibrium being established between opposing forces. The beauty of his argument is that the final result does not depend upon which forces are involved in setting up the dynamic equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|At Los Alamos, it {{was found}} in April 1944 by Emilio Segrè that the {{proposed}} Thin Man Gun assembly type bomb would not work for plutonium because of predetonation problems caused by Pu-240 impurities. So Fat Man, the implosion-type bomb, was given high priority as the only option for plutonium. The Berkeley discussions had generated theoretical estimates of critical mass, but nothing precise. The main wartime job at Los Alamos was the <b>experimental</b> <b>determination</b> of critical mass, which {{had to wait until}} sufficient amounts of fissile material arrived from the production plants: uranium from Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and plutonium from the Hanford site in Washington.|$|E
25|$|The German {{nuclear energy}} project, {{also known as}} the Uranverein (Uranium Club), began in the spring of 1939 {{under the auspices of the}} Reichsforschungsrat (RFR, Reich Research Council) of the Reichserziehungsministerium (REM, Reich Ministry of Education). By 1 September, the Heereswaffenamt (HWA, Army Ordnance Office) {{squeezed}} out the RFR and took over the effort. Under the control of the HWA, the Uranverein had its first meeting on 16 September. The meeting was organized by Kurt Diebner, advisor to the HWA, and held in Berlin. The invitees included Walther Bothe, Siegfried Flügge, Hans Geiger, Otto Hahn, Paul Harteck, Gerhard Hoffmann, Josef Mattauch, and Georg Stetter. A second meeting was held soon thereafter and included Klaus Clusius, Robert Döpel, Werner Heisenberg, and Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker. With Bothe being one of the principals, Wolfgang Gentner, Arnold Flammersfeld, Rudolf Fleischmann, Erwin Fünfer, and Peter Jensen were soon drawn into work for the Uranverein. Their research was published in the Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte (Research Reports in Nuclear Physics); see below the section Internal Reports. For the Uranverein, Bothe, and up to 6 members from his staff by 1942, worked on the <b>experimental</b> <b>determination</b> of atomic constants, the energy distribution of fission fragments, and nuclear cross sections. Bothe's erroneous experimental results on the absorption of neutrons in graphite were central in the German decision to favor heavy water as a neutron moderator.|$|E

2500|$|Van 't Hoff studied {{chemical}} {{dynamics and}} published in 1884 his famous [...] "Etudes de dynamique chimique". In 1901 he was awarded by the first Nobel Prize in Chemistry [...] "in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by {{the discovery of the}} laws of chemical dynamics and osmotic pressure in solutions". After van 't Hoff, chemical kinetics deals with the <b>experimental</b> <b>determination</b> of reaction rates from which rate laws and rate constants are derived. Relatively simple rate laws exist for zero order reactions (for which reaction rates are independent of concentration), first order reactions, and second order reactions, and can be derived for others. Elementary reactions follow the law of mass action, but the rate law of stepwise reactions has to be derived by combining the rate laws of the various elementary steps, and can become rather complex. In consecutive reactions, the rate-determining step often determines the kinetics. In consecutive first order reactions, a steady state approximation can simplify the rate law. The activation energy for a reaction is experimentally determined through the Arrhenius equation and the Eyring equation. The main factors that influence the reaction rate include: the physical state of the reactants, the concentrations of the reactants, the temperature at which the reaction occurs, and whether or not any catalysts are present in the reaction.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>experimental</b> <b>determination</b> {{has been}} made in vacuum. However, the vacuum we know is not the only {{possible}} vacuum which can exist. The vacuum has energy associated with it, called simply the vacuum energy, which could perhaps be altered in certain cases. When vacuum energy is lowered, light itself has been predicted to go faster than the standard value c. This is known as the Scharnhorst effect. Such a vacuum can be produced by bringing two perfectly smooth metal plates together at near atomic diameter spacing. It is called a Casimir vacuum. Calculations imply that light will go faster in such a vacuum by a minuscule amount: a photon traveling between two plates that are 1 micrometer apart would increase the photon's speed by only about one part in 1036. Accordingly, there has as yet been no experimental verification of the prediction. A recent analysis argued that the Scharnhorst effect cannot be used to send information backwards in time with a single set of plates since the plates' rest frame would define a [...] "preferred frame" [...] for FTL signalling. However, with multiple pairs of plates in motion relative to one another the authors noted that they had no arguments that could [...] "guarantee the total absence of causality violations", and invoked Hawking's speculative chronology protection conjecture which suggests that feedback loops of virtual particles would create [...] "uncontrollable singularities in the renormalized quantum stress-energy" [...] on the boundary of any potential time machine, and thus would require a theory of quantum gravity to fully analyze. Other authors argue that Scharnhorst's original analysis, which seemed to show the possibility of faster-than-c signals, involved approximations which may be incorrect, so that {{it is not clear whether}} this effect could actually increase signal speed at all.|$|E
