5|$|Zeus used {{mechanically}} steered radars, {{like the}} Nike SAMs before it, {{limiting the number}} of targets it could attack at once. A study by the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group (WSEG) calculated that the Soviets had a 90 percent chance of successfully hitting a Zeus base by firing only four warheads at it. These did not <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> land close in order to destroy the base; an explosion within several miles would destroy its radars, which were very difficult to harden. If the Soviets did have hundreds of missiles, they could easily afford to use some to attack the Zeus sites.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the nature}} of {{proteolytic}} venom, a viperid bite is often a very painful experience and should always be taken seriously, though it may not necessarily prove fatal. Even with prompt and proper treatment, a bite can still result in a permanent scar, and in the worst cases, the affected limb may <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be amputated. A victim's fate is impossible to predict, as this depends on many factors, including the species and size of the snake involved, how much venom was injected (if any), and the size and condition of the patient before being bitten. Viper bite victims may also be allergic to the venom and/or the antivenom.|$|E
25|$|I {{always had}} the feeling that no one {{understood}} me anyway, that no one knew who I was and what made me do this or that. And you know, when no one understands you, no one can call you to account. Not even the court could call me to account. But the dead can. They understand.

They came every night, whether I wanted them to or not. Before the trial I could still chase them away when they wanted to come.|$|E

The scenery of the White Pass route sounded like a great tourist draw; and the rails of the White Pass & Yukon Route were laid {{right down to the}} docks, even along them, for the former freight and cruise ship traffic. Cruise operators, remembering the attraction of the little mountain climbing trains to their passengers, pushed for a re-opening of the line as a heritage railway. The White Pass was and is perfectly positioned to sell a railroad ride through the mountains to cruise ship tourists; they do not <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> walk far.|$|E
25|$|If {{another team}} signs a {{released}} player {{who had a}} guaranteed contract (as long as the player has cleared waivers), the player's original team is allowed {{to reduce the amount}} of money they still owe the player (and lower their team payroll) by the right of set-off. This is true if the player signs with any professional team—it does not <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be an NBA team. The amount the original team gets to set off is limited to one-half the difference between the player's new salary and a pro-rated share of the minimum salary for a one-year veteran (if the player is a rookie, then the rookie minimum is used instead).|$|E
25|$|The latest {{development}} and preferred method for timing racing pigeons is the Electronic Timing System. The bird's arrival is recorded automatically. When using an electronic system, the pigeon fancier does not <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> {{be at the}} loft to clock the birds as they return. Birds are fitted with a band that has a tiny RFID chip in it which can be read when the bird comes home. At the home loft the electronic scanning records the pigeons arrival. The pad or antenna is placed at the entry point to the loft entrance and as the pigeon crosses it the electronic band is scanned. The clock {{is attached to the}} antennas. The serial number of the transponder ring is recorded along with the time of arrival. This is very similar to transponder timing systems used in human races.|$|E

"Calico Skies", which Paul McCartney {{had written}} when Hurricane Bob had hit while McCartney was staying on Long Island in 1991, and [...] "Great Day", which {{features}} backing vocal {{from his wife}} Linda McCartney, hailed from a 1992 session, recorded even before Off the Ground had come out. Starting from the mid-1990s for four years, McCartney was involved in The Beatles Anthology, a documentary {{on the history of}} The Beatles. The documentary was originally titled The Long and Winding Road, named after the Beatle song of the same name. During 1995, as the Anthology albums were starting to be released over a two-year period, EMI did not want McCartney to release a solo album in the meantime. McCartney said that he [...] "was almost insulted at first" [...] before then realising that [...] "it would be silly to go out against yourself in the form of The Beatles.

GamePro further commented that [...] "you don't <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be a full-fledged Trekker to appreciate the gaming goodness that Elite Force has to offer".

Staff of Idolator spoke favorably of Scherzinger's choreography, stating that it [...] "would make the other Pussycat Dolls blush".

500|$|The idea of {{creating}} a reality series originated in 2006 when Kris Jenner showed an interest in appearing on a television show together with her family. Jenner commented: [...] "Everybody thinks that [...] could create a bunch of drama in their lives, but it's something that I felt I didn't <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> think about. It would be natural." [...] Producer Ryan Seacrest, who had his own production company, decided to develop the idea, having the popular family-based show The Osbournes in mind. He hired a camera man to visit the Kardashian's family home to film them having a Sunday barbeque: [...] "They were all together [...] as crazy and as fun as loving as they are," [...] Seacrest described the family after seeing the tape. He later initiated the series by sharing the tape with E!, an American cable network which features mostly entertainment-related programming, and reality television series; the show was eventually picked up. In August 2007, {{it was announced that}} the Kardashian and Jenner families would star in a yet-to-be-titled reality show on E! described as a [...] "new non-scripted family sitcom", being produced by Ryan Seacrest and Bunim/Murray Productions.

500|$|For the 2002 presidential election, {{opinion polls}} had {{predicted}} a run-off between incumbent President Chirac and PS candidate Lionel Jospin. The shock was thus great when Le Pen unexpectedly beat Jospin (by 0.7%) {{in the first}} round. This resulted in the first presidential run-off since 1969 without a leftist candidate, and the first ever with a candidate of the far-right. To Le Pen's advantage, the election campaign had increasingly focused on law and order issues, helped by media attention {{on a number of}} violent incidents. Jospin had also been weakened due to the competition between an exceptional number of leftist parties. Nevertheless, Chirac did not <b>even</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> campaign in the second round, as widespread anti-Le Pen protests from the media and public opinion culminated on May Day, with an estimated 1.5 million demonstrators across France. Chirac also refused to debate with Le Pen, and the traditional televised debate was cancelled. In the end, Chirac won the presidential run-off with an unprecedented 82.2% of the vote and with 71% of his votes—according to polls—cast simply [...] "to block Le Pen". Following the presidential election, the main centre-right parties merged to form the broad-based Union for a Popular Movement (UMP). The FN failed to hold on to Le Pen's support for the 2002 legislative elections, in which it got 11.3% of the vote. It nevertheless outpolled Mégret's MNR, which won a mere 1.1% support, even though it had fielded the same number of candidates.|$|E
