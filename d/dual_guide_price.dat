40|$|This study examinees the {{relationship}} between <b>guide</b> and sale <b>prices</b> for residential properties in Greater Dublin during the recent housing boom. The results indicate that large degrees of divergence can be present and that auctioned properties tend to sell more frequently at a premium to their <b>guide</b> <b>price</b> and that the average level of premium is also higher. These findings are confirmed by econometric analysis. It is proposed that the two potential causes behind this mispricing are the speculative boom in the Dublin market during the period and the potential that agents build into auction <b>guide</b> <b>prices</b> an element of underpricing {{in order to increase}} interest in the properties on the market.
