25|$|In 1975, Saint Phalle {{wrote the}} {{screenplay}} for Un rêve plus long que la nuit (A Dream Longer Than the Night, later also called Camélia et le Dragon), and she recruited {{many of her}} artist friends to help {{make it into a}} film, a phantasmagorical tale of dragons, monsters, and adolescence. A young girl is held captive by a dragon, manages to escape, and must explore Sept Portes du Mystère ("Seven Doors of Mystery") to find love. Saint Phalle's daughter Laura was the lead character in the film, appearing with Saint Phalle, Jean Tinguely, and other artist friends; Peter Whitehead composed the music. For the filming, she designed several pieces of furniture, which were later displayed on the facade of the Palais des Beaux-Arts (Fine Arts Palace) in Brussels. From 1968-1988, she also worked on Last Night <b>I</b> <b>Had</b> <b>a</b> <b>Dream,</b> a sculptural relief painting that included many elements from her earlier life and dreams.|$|E

500|$|It was {{amid the}} New Woman and burgeoning suffragist {{movements}} that, in 1908, O'Neill began {{to concentrate on}} producing original artwork, and {{it was during this}} period that she created the whimsical Kewpie characters for which she became known. Their name, [...] "Kewpie", derives from Cupid, the Roman god of love. According to O'Neill, she became obsessed with the idea of the cherubic characters, to the point that she had dreams about them: [...] "I thought about the Kewpies so much that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> about them where they were all doing acrobatic pranks on the coverlet of my bed. One sat in my hand." [...] She described them as [...] "a sort of little round fairy whose one idea is to teach people to be merry and kind at the same time". The Kewpie characters made their debut in comic strip form in 1909 in an issue of Ladies' Home Journal. Further publications of the Kewpie comics in Woman's Home Companion and Good Housekeeping helped the cartoon grow in popularity rapidly.|$|E

2500|$|Clarkson {{described}} the fifth song and title track [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] as her most personal {{song on the}} album. It was produced by Kurstin, who co-wrote the song with Clarkson after a conversation she had with her sister about their family life. The sixth song, [...] "Run Run Run", features American recording artist John Legend. Produced by Jason Halbert, {{it was written by}} Tim James, Antonina Armato, Joacim Persson, Ry Cuming, and David Jost. Clarkson and Legend had previously worked together on the short-lived American television program Duets in 2012. Originally deeming it to be a solo record, Clarkson invited Legend to turn the track into a duet after recording her part during the 2013 Honda Civic Tour. Legend responded within ten minutes, saying: [...] "Oh my God, I'd love to do it. Send me the file!" [...] "Run Run Run" [...] was also recorded by the German rock band Tokio Hotel for their fifth studio album Kings of Suburbia (2014), which Clarkson was unfamiliar with until releasing her version of the song. Clarkson co-wrote the seventh track [...] "I Had a Dream" [...] with Kurstin (who also produced it) after lamenting with her friends about the dichotomy that exists between expectations and reality and her disappointment in their generation. Clarkson bemoaned: [...] "I don't understand why we're still struggling with these basic, asinine issues [...] It bothers me. So I ended up writing this whole song about it and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>dream</b> that we were more." [...] The song features a [...] "gospely chorus." ...|$|E
