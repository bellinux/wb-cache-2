[...] The {{first time that}} a {{generator}} invocation is reached in a loop, an iterator object is created that encapsulates the state of the generator routine at its beginning, with arguments bound to the corresponding parameters. The generator's body is then executed in the context of that iterator until a special yield action is encountered; at that time, the value provided with the yield action is used as the value of the invocation expression. The next time the same generator invocation is reached in a subsequent iteration, the execution of the generator's body is resumed after the yield action, until yet another yield action is encountered. In addition to the yield action, execution of the <b>generator</b> <b>body</b> can also be terminated by a finish action, at which time the innermost loop enclosing the generator invocation is terminated. In more complicated situations, a generator may be used manually outside of a loop to create an iterator, which can then be used in various ways.|$|E

A complex flowfield develops where shock and expansion waves from a <b>generator</b> <b>body</b> impinge upon the adjacent receiver body and modify its aerodynamic characteristics {{in comparison to}} the isolated case. The aim of this research is to quantify and understand the multibody interference effects that arise between a finned slender body and a second disturbance <b>generator</b> <b>body.</b> A parametric wind tunnel study was performed in which the effects of the receiver incidence and axial stagger were considered. Computational fluid dynamic simulations showed good agreement with the measurements, and these were used in the interpretation of the experimental results.

40|$|SUMMARY Limited {{information}} is available documenting body surface isopotential distributions during atrial excitation and recovery. To expand the current data base, body surface isopotential maps from 40 nor-mal subjects were examined. Data were acquired at a gain of 10, 000 and isopotential distributions constructed at 2 -msec intervals from {{the onset of the}} P wave to the onset of the QRS complex. During the initial half of the P wave, a left midprecordial maximum dominated the distribution. Negative potentials existed over the upper back. Subsequently, the maximum migrated to the left; negative potentials moved into precordial areas. Near the end of the P wave, the maximum shifted to the left back as a minimum evolved over the midprecordium. This minimum increased in intensity and remained stationary throughout the PR segment. These patterns are consistent with previously reported epicardial records from canine preparations documenting initial right and then left atrial activation, and repolarization beginning before the end of excitation and enveloping much of the posterior atrial epicardium with low-level positive potential. All distributions had but a single maximum and/or minimum, consistent with a single dipole equivalent cardiac <b>generator.</b> <b>BODY</b> SURFACE ISOPOTENTIAL mapping has evolved into a clinically and experimentally valuable tool.

40|$|Abstract. Foaming {{experiments}} {{in order to}} understand the evolution of the foam structure blown in different directions and levels of gravity have been carried out. The key elements of the experiment are the foam <b>generator</b> <b>body</b> (henceforth FG) and the controlled blowing apparatus. The FG was a polymer foam infiltrated with a suspension (distilled water, pure tenside (SDS, 0. 05 m%) and SiO 2 nanoparticles (2 m%)) Foams were blown out at 1. 5, 2, 4, 6, 10 and at 15 g levels in three different directions (0, 90 and 180 o, measured to the direction of the gravity vector). The elevated gravity condition was implemented in a hyper-g centrifuge (ZARM Bremen). Results show that foams can be created even at high gravity levels though the foamability and foam structure alters a lot by varying gravity level and foaming direction. At higher g-levels, under fixed gas flow rate and blowing time less foam could be produced. The average cell size varied with the blowing directions but proved constant on any gravity levels. On base of the gravity direction dependent pressure curves the foaming process was interpreted in detail. It was found that the sedimentation ruled capillary clogging is the main process by causing the gravity direction dependent foaming phenomena. The unexpected observation is that the foam stability does not depend on the gravity level...|$|E
40|$|Significant {{aerodynamic}} interference {{can occur}} between high-speed bodies in close proximity. A complex flowfield develops where shock and expansion waves from a <b>generator</b> <b>body</b> impinge upon the adjacent receiver body. The pressure and flow angularity changes which occur across these disturbances modify the body aerodynamics. The {{aim of this}} research is to quantify the aerodynamic interference effects for multi-body configurations and understand the relevant flow physics. The interference aerodynamics for slender bodies in a supersonic flow were investigated through a parametric wind tunnel study. The receiver bodies were finned and un-finned configurations. The effect of lateral and axial body separations, receiver incidence and the strength of the disturbance field were investigated. Measurements included forces and moments, surface pressures and flow visualisations. Supporting computations using steady-state, viscous predictions provided {{a deeper understanding of the}} underlying aerodynamics and flow mechanisms. Good agreement was found between the measured and predicted interference loads and surface pressures for all configurations. The interference loads are strongly dependent upon the axial impingement location of the primary shockwave. These induced loads change polarity as the impingement location moves aft over the receiver. The magnitude of the interference loads increase when the receiver is at incidence and are amplified by up to a factor of three when rear fins are attached. In general, the interference loads are larger for a stronger disturbance flowfield. The centre of pressure location is substantially affected and the static stability of the finned receiver changes in some configurations. The effect of the aerodynamic interference on the body trajectories was assessed using an unsteady, Euler prediction in combination with a 6 DOF dynamic model. This shows aerodynamic ii interference can cause a collision between the bodies. Moreover, the initial interference loads dominate the subsequent body trajectories and static modelling can be used to evaluate the dynamic trajectories.

The existence of a singular <b>generator</b> on the <b>body</b> surface in the plane of yaw and on the "leeward" side, at which the entropy is many-valued is brought out.

40|$|As {{part of the}} {{research}} on locomotion controller that aims to produce robots whose design is inspired by Nature, this thesis intends to develop a simulator of the salamander locomotion. It investigates, in particular, what type of circuitry can produce and modulate the neural activity for swimming and trotting. In water, the animal moves by propagating a traveling wave of muscular contractions along the body while holding the limbs against it in an undulatory gait. On the ground, instead, the salamander switches into a stepping gait with the body making a S-shaped standing wave coordinated with the movements of the limbs. While the connectivity and properties of the neural circuit that regulate the movement of the salamander have not been decoded so far, the locomotor controller that is used here corresponds to the general organization hypothesis of neurobiologists who believe the controller is made of a lamprey-like Central Pattern <b>Generator</b> <b>body</b> (CPG) and two limbs CPGs. The neural circuit is implemented as a Dynamic Artificial Neural Network whose units, modeled as leaky integrators, try to simulate accurately the properties of similar biological neurons. A three-dimensional mechanical model is developed that also takes into account the realistic forces acting upon it in order to verify whether the locomotor controller is able to reproduce the desired pattern for both swimming and trotting. The neural model controls the mechanical one through the contractions of the muscles. In an incremental approach, a Genetic Algorithm is used to develop the neural circuit capable of reproducing the salamander locomotion in the mechanical simulation of the animal. The connections of the circuit and the properties of the neurons are evolved in three stages. First, the singular segmental oscillator is evolved. Second, the evolution of the intersegmental connections {{in the body of the}} salamander, composed of forty identical segment oscillators, follows. Third, the limb CPG and its coupling with the body CPG is finally developed. The neural controller resulting from these three steps is able to switch from one gait to the other, to modulate the velocity, and to change the direction based on the tonic input received from the brainstem. The locomotor circuit is also capable of replicating in the mechanical body the gaits observed in the real salamander, which, considering the intention of the thesis, is proving the successful simulation of the animal locomotion. </p...|$|E

Booster set 836/2D had been designed by English Electric for use in Class 71 and this was retained in the rebuild, although weight considerations meant that the flywheel assembly, separate auxiliary generator and traction motor blowers were removed (the latter leading to the decision to downrate the traction motors). The compact size of the booster permitted a small diesel engine and <b>generator</b> inside the <b>body</b> shell (only a single booster was used in Classes 71 & 74 unlike the two of Class 70).

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 70 - 71. It {{is currently}} estimated that 600, 000 cardiac pacemakers are implanted per year worldwide. It {{is expected that}} the usage of other stimulators such as deep brain stimulators (DBS) will reach this number in a short period. On the other hand, 2, 000, 000 MRI examinations are carried out each year worldwide and usage of MRI is expected to increase. Unfortunately, people with metallic implants have significant risks in the MRI scanners. It is known that radio frequency and gradient fields of the MRI scanners may induce harmful currents on the implant leads. Radio frequency pulses may cause excessive heating and burns. In addition to this, time-varying gradient magnetic field induced currents on the leads can cause nerve stimulation. In case of cardiac pacemakers, this nerve stimulation may cause cardiac arrest. In this thesis, novel MRI compatible lead designs were proposed. Lead designs are presented to ensure safe magnetic resonance scanning of patients with active metallic implants such as pacemakers, neurostimulators, and implantable cardio defibrillators. Semiconductor components such as transistors and diodes are used to prevent these undesired induced currents on the implant leads. Circuits on the implants are designed such that while the induction of currents is prevented, the desired signal transmission in between the implanted pulse <b>generator</b> and the <b>body</b> part is maintained. The designs were tested by using experiments and computer stimulation. It was seen that the new techniques are effective in making MRI safe implantable devices. Benefits and problems of each design {{will be discussed in}} this text. It is believed that using this or similar techniques, patients with the implants will be able to be examined safely in MRI scanners. Ermeydan, AhmetM. S...|$|R
40|$|Human-powered {{inertial}} {{energy harvesting}} is an emerging technology that can power electronic devices using electrical energy scavenged from human motion. Traditional energy harvesters generate energy {{only from a}} single axis, and are referred to one degree-of-freedom (1 -DOF) energy harvesters. In this thesis, a two degree-of-freedom (2 -DOF) energy harvester consisting of two orthogonal 1 -DOF energy harvesters is studied. This research theoretically and experimentally investigates the effect of orientation, location and activity on the obtainable power from 2 -DOF human-powered inertial energy harvesters. An on-body measurement study has been conducted to collect acceleration data from five key locations on the body during both walking and running. The collected data have been analyzed to evaluate the harvestable power along different orientations of both 1 -DOF and 2 -DOF inertial energy harvesters. The {{results show that the}} orientation of 1 -DOF <b>generators</b> on the <b>body</b> greatly affects the output power. 2 -DOF generators can maintain a more constant power output with rotation, thus are more reliable than 1 -DOF generators. For 1 -DOF generators, and for each location and activity, only 6 % of the tested orientations harvest over 90 % of the maximum power. For 2 -DOF generators, this is increased to 32 %, showing a considerable improvement. To validate the analytical results, 1 -DOF mechanical- and magnetic-spring electromagnetic generators have been designed and prototyped. A novel design has been proposed to linearise magnetic springs for low frequency use. Experimental validation shows that the design exhibits a linearity of 2 % across a ± 25 mm displacement range, presenting a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art. A 2 -DOF inertial generator that consists of two orthogonal 1 -DOF mechanical-spring generators has been tested at three locations around the knee while running. At each location, the 2 -DOF generator has been rotated to four different angles. The results show that 2 -DOF generators can generate over 81 % of the maximum power in all orientations. For 1 -DOF generators, it is only 35 %...|$|R
40|$|Abstract A simple {{solar energy}} powered {{intermittent}} absorption refrigeration system was designed, fabricated and tested. The system uses a generator charged with ammonia and water. The heat source is a solar radiation collector that collects and radiates {{solar thermal energy}} onto a black <b>body</b> <b>generator.</b> The generator drives the refrigerant around the system through a condenser and an evaporator. The system was evaluated by leaving it outside under solar radiation and monitoring temperatures at various points inside the collector, the generator, and the evaporator {{through the use of}} thermocouple sensors. The average highest and lowest temperatures inside the solar collector were 100 °C and 40 °C respectively. The average lowest refrigeration temperature was 4 °C. The coefficient of performance (COP) of the system was estimated at 0. 487.

40|$|In Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, explosions {{accounted}} for 81 % of all injuries; {{this is a}} higher casualty percentage than in any previous wars. Blast wave overpressure has recently been associated with varying levels of traumatic brain injury in soldiers exposed to blast loading. Presently, the injury mechanism behind primary blast brain injury is not well understood due to the complex interactions between the blast wave and the human body. Despite these limitations {{in the understanding of}} head injury thresholds, head kinematics are often used to predict the overall potential for head injury. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate head kinematics, and predict injury from a range of simulated blast loads at varying standoff distances and differing heights of bursts. The validated <b>Generator</b> of <b>body</b> data multi-body human surrogate model allows for numerical kinematic data simulation in explicit finite element method fluid structure interaction blast modeling. Two finite element methods were investigated to simulate blast interaction with humans, an enhanced blast uncoupled method, and an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eularian fully coupled method. The enhanced blast method defines an air blast function through the application of a blast pressure wave, including ground reflections, based on the explosives relative location to a target; the pressures curves are based on the Convention Weapons databases. LBE model is efficient for parametric numerical studies of blast interaction where the target response is the only necessary result. The ALE model, unlike classical Lagrangian methods, has a fixed finite element mesh that allows material to flow through it; this enables simulation of large deformation problems such as blast in an air medium and its subsequent interaction with structures. The ALE model should be used when research into a specific blast scenario is of interest, since this method is more computationally expensive. The ALE method can evaluate a blast scenario in more detail including: explosive detonation, blast wave development and propagation, near-field fireball effects, blast wave reflection, as well as 3 D blast wave interaction, reflection and refraction with a target. Both approaches were validated against experimental blast tests performed by Defense Research and Development Valcartier and ConWep databases for peak pressure, arrival time, impulse, and curve shape. The models were in good agreement with one another and follow the experimental data trend showing an exponential reduction in peak acceleration with increasing standoff distance until the Mach stem effect reached head height. The Mach stem phenomenon is a shock front formed by the merging of the incident and reflected shock waves; it increases the applied peak pressure and duration of a blast wave thus expanding the potential head injury zone surrounding a raised explosive. The enhanced blast model was in good agreement with experimental data in the near-field, and mid-field; however, overestimated the peak acceleration, and head injury criteria values in the far-field due to an over predicted pressure impulse force. The ALE model also over predicted the response based on the head injury criteria at an increased standoff distance due to smearing of the blast wave over several finite elements leading to an increased duration loading. According to the Abbreviated Injury Scale, the models predicted a maximal level 6 injury for all explosive sizes in the near-field, with a rapid acceleration of the head over approximately 1 ms. There is a drastic exponential reduction in the insult force and potential injury received with increasing standoff distance outside of the near-field region of an explosive charge...|$|R
