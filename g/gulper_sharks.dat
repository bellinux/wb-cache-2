5|$|Until recently, Portugal was {{the only}} European country to utilize the Portuguese dogfish. An {{important}} bycatch of the black scabbardfish (Aphanops carbo) longline fishery, between 300 and 900 tons of this shark were landed annually from 1986 to 1999. Its per-weight value has been increasing since 1986, and thus exploitation is likely to continue. Around 1990, French bottom trawlers began to fish for Portuguese dogfish and leafscale <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> (Centrophorus squamosus) west of the British Isles for meat and livers; these two species are together referred to as siki. The siki catch peaked at 3,284 tons in 1996 before declining to 1,939 tons in 1999. The French have since been joined by Norwegian, Irish, and Scottish longliners and trawlers, making the Portuguese dogfish a significant component of deepwater fisheries in the northwest Atlantic. While stocks off Portugal seem to be stable for now, stocks off the British Isles have diminished substantially in recent years; this may reflect the disparity between the less massified Portuguese fishery and the commercial French fishery. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Near Threatened, because of its commercial value and low reproductive productivity.|$|E
25|$|Shark {{have been}} fished for centuries in the Maldives. The main groups of sharks {{caught in the}} Maldives are reef sharks, deep water <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> and ocean sharks. The reef shark fishery generates more revenue for the {{fisheries}} and tourism than the other groups. Shark fisheries continue to be exploited, particularly for export purposes.|$|E
50|$|Male <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> tend to outnumber females 2:1, {{which is}} common for many fish species. The life {{expectancy}}, longevity, of female <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> ranges between 54 and 70 years. Having a long life expectancy but a low net reproduction rate suggests that the population of <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> would be {{at a very high}} risk if too many of them were killed from excessive fishing.|$|E

50|$|Female <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> {{typically}} have between 2 and 10 pups in their lifetime, with generally one pup per pregnancy, this {{is considered to}} be a low fecundity. Once fertilized, females can hold up to 6 mature egg cells, or oocytes, in their body at a time. The length of time these egg cells are kept inside the female’s body is called the gestation period. <b>Gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> have a long gestation period, around two years. <b>Gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> can have long resting periods between pregnancies.|$|E
50|$|Human {{interaction}} with the gulper shark exists mainly {{in the form of}} fishing. Longline fishing is a typical method for fishing at the depth required to catch <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks,</b> and the broad distribution of gulper habitat leads to this method being used to catch gulpers around the world. However, <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> are not always caught intentionally. The deep waters in which the gulper and similar shark species live is difficult to harvest, and longlines are an unspecific form of fishing. Longlines intended for other species can easily catch <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks.</b>|$|E
50|$|On average, male <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> {{are smaller}} than females. The size of an average adult male is 80 to 95 cm. The size of an average adult female is from 90 to 100 cm long. Differences in size between the sexes {{may be due to}} the need for space to support offspring. It has been {{hypothesized}} that <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> display a “depth distribution pattern associated with size” based on random human observation.|$|E

50|$|While {{information}} concerning <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> exists, {{there is no}} place to centrally compile the information so that other researchers may easily obtain it. This leads to repetition in basic data and less depth into the subject matter. Information presented may also be inaccurate as many genus of Centrophorus are morphologically similar. While attempts are being made {{to make it easier to}} identify different genus, such as Daley’s use of 16s mitochondrial DNA listed above, older data listed for <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> could be for ones other than the granulosus, such as the dumb gulper shark. This also means that current populations numbers could account for other dogfish than just the <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks.</b> Lastly, due to the frequency and patterns of migration, the recorded gulper shark populations may be inaccurate.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{frequency}} and patterns of migration the gulper shark population estimates may be inaccurate with some sharks being counted twice, which are exacerbated by inappropriate tagging techniques. There are multiple species of <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks,</b> which has contributed to misidentification in the past. For example, populations of the gulper shark in the Southeast Atlantic Ocean may represent a separate species. Therefore, taxonomic confusion may influence current geographical range. The <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> like deep, murky waters.|$|E
50|$|Lowfin <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> live at depths between 300 and 1,400 m. They are {{ovoviviparous}} {{and give}} birth to up to six pups per litter. They feed on other sharks, bony fish, crabs, and lobsters.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> reach {{maturity}} {{at around}} age 12 to 16 years for females, and age 7 to 8 years for males. The maturity of a gulper shark {{can be determined}} by the seven-stage maturity scale for aplacental and placental viviparous sharks. This scale is good for practical field use, but may not be as accurate as other maturity scales that have more than seven stages. Maturity for <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> is considered when they are at stage 3 or above, which for males is when gonads are enlarged and filled with sperm, and sperm ducts are tightly coiled. For females, stage three is when ovaries are large and well rounded.|$|E
50|$|Other {{areas of}} gulper shark populations have no current regulations. The Northwest Atlantic Ocean {{currently}} has no rules {{in regard to}} the harvesting of <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks,</b> and has already seen a decrease in gulper population of 80-95% since 1990.|$|E
50|$|While {{the fishing}} of <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> and {{utilization}} of squalene from their livers is not inherently {{an activity that}} drives them toward extinction, overexploitation of the species can be a problem. The status of <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> on the ICUN red list is currently only vulnerable rather than endangered. The squalene taken from the gulper liver is in high demand as a possible cancer therapy component among other uses, leading to unchecked harvesting of the species. When the populations are declining due to overexploitation, each viable individual is important. As much as 80% of the gulper population has been depleted in some areas, so any harvesting can have a large effect on {{the decline of the}} species or possible recovery.|$|E

50|$|The broad {{teeth of}} this species differ between {{the upper and lower}} jaws, with the lower teeth being much larger. The teeth also differ between the male and female, with the male having much more erect, upright upper teeth, and upward-curving tips on the lowers.

50|$|A long {{gestation}} period, later maturity, {{and long}} lifespan {{all contribute to}} a K-selected tendency that favors intraspecific competition, or competition with similar species, over survival defenses {{having to do with}} predation. Harvesting is a form of predation that slow, invested reproduction does not easily alleviate. The long gestation, low fecundity, and breaks in individual reproduction lead to slow repopulation ability. Slow reproduction {{is a part of the}} species biology, and cannot be changed in one generation based on sudden predation pressure. A group of <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> that undergoes predation by humans may take fifteen years or longer to recover, if at all, based on their maturation time of twelve to sixteen years. Large populations of <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> must be built over long periods of time.|$|E
50|$|Shark {{have been}} fished for centuries in the Maldives. The main groups of sharks {{caught in the}} Maldives are reef sharks, deep water <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> and ocean sharks. The reef shark fishery generates more revenue for the {{fisheries}} and tourism than the other groups. Shark fisheries continue to be exploited, particularly for export purposes.|$|E
50|$|Gulper life {{strategy}} is {{also consistent with}} their trophic level and place in the deepwater community. They are tertiary consumers with no apparent predators, so their biological gear toward competition is an ecologically sound strategy. The introduction of human interaction with <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> is the introduction of a higher trophic level, and presents a relationship that current gulper biology is not equipped to handle while maintaining steady or growing population size.|$|E

50|$|Fins {{and meat}} are {{generally}} taken from <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks,</b> {{but it is}} of particular interest because of the quantity of liver oil it contains: compared to similar species such as the dogfish shark, the gulper has a larger liver with more oil. Traditionally, shark oil is a folk remedy for a variety of ailments, but also has been shown to contain compounds of contemporary medicinal value, most notable squalene, although the compound can also be extracted from plants. This compound makes the liver of the gulper shark very valuable and is a large part of gulper-specific fishing.|$|E
50|$|The Centrophoridae are {{a family}} of squaliform sharks. The family {{contains}} just two genera and about 15 species. They are sometimes called <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks,</b> but {{this is also the}} name of a specific species in the family, Centrophorus granulosus.These are generally deepwater fish. While some, such as the gulper shark C. granulosus, are found worldwide and fished commercially, others are uncommon and little-known. Their usual prey is other fish; some are known to feed on squid, octopus, and shrimp. Some species live on the bottom (benthic), while others are pelagic. They are ovoviviparous, with the female retaining the egg-cases in her body until they hatch.|$|E
50|$|The key to {{overexploitation}} in <b>gulper</b> <b>sharks</b> is {{that they}} require nearly {{as much time as}} humans to mature and reproduce. Their life strategy indicates that the frame of view for gulper fishing plans needs to be based on longer amounts of time, to allow for the consideration of the next generation of individuals. Gulper shark do not mature much faster than humans, so they need to be exploited based on a schedule that reflects this. However, being harvested by a species with similar growth patterns means that the gulper shark is unlikely to be considered in this way. It is highly susceptible to overexploitation leading to widespread population decline and its status and a species vulnerable to endangerment.|$|E
