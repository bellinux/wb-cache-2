25|$|Catastrophe is {{not only}} about a {{political}} situation and {{the place of the}} artist in it. The victim or “protagonist” is also representative of all actors, having to portray what writers write for them in the way directors tell them to do it (Beckett is not unaware of his own relationship with actors, particularly those who in the past have resisted his stage directions). The director in the play catches two prototypes, that of the political commissar and of the all-powerful personality director like Peter Brook, Vitez, , who bend a performance to their own interpretation, where often the victim is the author himself; there are many “in” theatrical jokes. The director’s assistant coolly carries out her instructions, and <b>it</b> <b>matters</b> little if we are in a concentration camp or a film studio: all humane considerations are ruled out to achieve the ultimate work of art. The two-pronged metaphor is incredibly effective for all its surface simplicity. In time, as with all of Beckett’s work, more strands and allusions will be discovered.|$|E

Likewise, <b>it</b> <b>matters</b> not whether Ms. Welch has ever walked the streets of [...] "the black dust towns of East Tennessee" [...] about which she sings in [...] "Miner's Refrain" [...] because the sense of foreboding that she expresses for the men who once labored in coal mines with futile hopes of a better life comes through loud and clear.|$|E

While several prominent trainers questioned his decision, Baffert {{believed that it was}} more important to keep American Pharoah [...] "happy" [...] on a track he liked, having used a similar strategy with his 2001 Belmont Stakes winner, Point Given. Rival trainers Kiaran McLaughlin and D. Wayne Lukas backed Baffert's strategy, with McLaughlin making the remark, [...] "I don't think <b>it</b> <b>matters</b> for American Pharoah. He could probably run down a street over broken glass." [...] Appearing unperturbed but curious about a small crowd of well-wishers, American Pharoah arrived at Long Island MacArthur Airport on June 2, having traveled from Louisville, Kentucky on a customized Boeing 727 dubbed [...] "Air Horse One".|$|E

[...] An {{example of such a}} recipe is [...] "To à la Daube Pigeons"; a daube is a rich French meat stew from Provence, traditionally made with beef. Her [...] "A Goose à la Mode" [...] is served in a sauce flavoured with red wine, home-made [...] "Catchup", veal sweetbread, truffles, morels, and (more ordinary) mushrooms. She occasionally uses French ingredients; [...] "To make a rich Cake" [...] includes [...] "half a Pint of right French Brandy", as well as the same amount of [...] "Sack" [...] (Spanish sherry).|$|E
500|$|Immediately the two {{incidents}} raised {{rumors of}} a possible Blink-182 reunion. Hoppus was alerted about Barker's accident by a phone call {{in the middle of}} the night and jumped on the next flight to the burn center. DeLonge learned of the crash via the TV news at an airport while waiting to board a flight. He landed and mailed a letter and two photographs to Barker: a photo of Blink aboard a submarine in the Middle East and another of himself and his two kids. [...] "One was 'Do you remember who we were?' and the other was 'This is who I am now,' [...] " [...] DeLonge said DeLonge also commented that, no matter what happened between himself and Barker in the past, [...] "none of <b>it</b> <b>matters</b> when it comes down to somebody getting hurt." [...] Hoppus first spoke on the matter in a blog post in November 2008, writing that he [...] "hadn't had it in him" [...] to post, adding that [...] "these past two months have been the hardest times I can remember." [...] He also revealed that he, DeLonge, and Barker had all spoken in the aftermath. Barker quashed reunion rumors in December, but noted that they had been getting along.|$|E
500|$|Niels Matthijs, {{writing for}} Twitch Film, stated that [...] "It's astounding how van Dormael turns each scene into a unique little {{cinematic}} event. There is hardly filler here, no scenes to drag out the running time or to fill some gaps in between other climaxes. Every scene matters and every scene {{is made to}} look like <b>it</b> <b>matters.</b> The director uses all means to his disposal to keep the viewer engaged and interested {{in the life of the}} main protagonist, Nemo Nobody." [...] Fred Topel, writing for Screen Junkies, praised the film's artistry, saying [...] "All of Nemo's lives are painful. No matter what he chooses, he experiences heartbreak, death of loved ones, his own death, and clinical depression. My future seems brighter, but the film makes the strong point that every experience is worthwhile. The goal isn't to choose the easiest path. It's to live." [...] Chris Holt from Starburst magazine wrote that [...] "Mr. Nobody is a film that is remarkable by its very existence and that in itself is something to be happy about. You may love it you may hate it, but you can bet that you will never forget it." [...] Exclaim!s Robert Bell called the film [...] "a powerful movie about what it means to be alive." ...|$|E

500|$|The lyrics for Wasting Light were {{completed}} {{during the week}} each song was being recorded. Grohl said that the words were [...] "what was on my mind each week", most being [...] "written {{from the perspective of}} who I was then and who I am now", with references to the past, life and death, and [...] "time, but questioning whether <b>it</b> <b>matters</b> at all. There's so much focus on the before that people forget there's an after." [...] The frontman said this was helped by the environment - [...] "a lot of retrospection and introspection and nostalgia going back to the way we used to make records" [...] - and working with Vig again, which [...] "made me think a lot about starting over, and rebirth, and making your way through tragedy and coming out the other side." [...] An example was [...] "I Should Have Known", partially inspired by former Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain - [...] "a song like 'I Should Have Known' is about all the people I've lost, not just Kurt". Grohl still tried to do laid-back songs such as [...] "White Limo", which had its lyrics written in just two minutes, specially after Mendel sent him an e-mail saying, [...] "I really like it when you write songs that are silly and mean nothing, too. You don't have to try to write 'Imagine' every time you sit down with a pen and paper".|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of Jessica Jones, David Priest at net wrote about how the series rescues [...] "Marvel from itself ... Jessica Jones takes big steps forward in terms of theme, craft and diversity. It's a good story first, and a superhero show second. And for the first time, the MCU seems like <b>it</b> <b>matters.</b> Our culture needs stories like this. Here's hoping Marvel keeps them coming." [...] For Paul Tassi and Erik Kain of Forbes, {{watching}} the series made them question the MCU, with Kain feeling that the [...] "morally complex, violent, dark world of Jessica Jones {{has no place in}} the MCU ... right now, the MCU is holding back shows like Jessica Jones and Daredevil, while those shows are contributing absolutely nothing to the MCU." [...] Tassi {{went so far as to}} wonder what [...] "the point of the Marvel Cinematic Universe" [...] is, lamenting the lack of major crossovers in the franchise since the Winter Soldier reveal on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and saying that Jessica Jones is [...] "so far removed from the world of The Avengers, it might as well not be in the same universe at all ... really don't understand the point of [...] if they're going to keep everything within it separated off in these little boxes". Conversely, Eric Francisco of Inverse called Jessica Joness lack of overt connections to the MCU [...] "the show's chief advantage. Besides demonstrating how physically wide open the MCU's scope really is, Jessica Jones also proves the MCU's thematic durability." ...|$|E

Virgin Media listed Mercedes' wedding to Russ amongst their list of [...] "Soap's biggest wedding day disasters" [...] before adding that [...] "McQueen weddings are full of drama, and Russ and Mercedes' big day was no exception". Virgin Media later profiled some of Hollyoaks' [...] "hottest females" [...] in their opinion, and stated about Mercedes, [...] "As one of the hottest ladies in Hollyoaks, with curves to die for, Mercedes has had more men than hot dinners. And now Malachy's met his maker, we're sure it won't be long till Mercedes earns yet another notch on her bedpost". The Liverpool Echo described Mercedes' desire to marry saying, [...] "Mercedes has finally got what she's wanted for so long - a great big gleaming rock on her finger. Not that <b>it</b> <b>matters</b> who gave it to her, of course". Anthony D. Langford from AfterElton praised Mercedes, saying he loved the character and had these affections [...] "Because frankly, she scares the bejeezus out of me.
