25|$|The {{sense of}} {{something}} being missing on Aliens was greater {{for me than}} on The Abyss, where the film just got consistently better as the cut got along. The film must function as a dramatic, organic whole. When I cut the film together, things that read well on paper, on a conceptual level, didn't necessarily translate to the screen as well. I felt <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>losing</b> something by breaking my focus. Breaking the story's focus and coming off the main characters was a far greater detriment to the film than what was gained. The film keeps the same message intact at a thematic level, not at a really overt level, by working in a symbolic way.|$|E
500|$|According to Barry Miles, Lennon resented McCartney's {{direction}} of the band as well as how, aside from [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever", he himself was now supplying [...] "songs to order" [...] rather than [...] "writing from the heart" [...] as he had on Revolver. Everett describes Starr as having been [...] "largely bored" [...] during the sessions, with the drummer later lamenting: [...] "The biggest memory I have of Sgt. Pepper... is I learned to play chess". Speaking in 2000, Harrison said he {{had little interest in}} McCartney's concept of a fictitious group and that, after his experiences in India, [...] "my heart was still out there … <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>losing</b> interest in being 'fab' at that point." [...] Harrison added that, having enjoyed recording Rubber Soul and Revolver, he disliked how the group's approach on Sgt. Pepper became [...] "an assembly process" [...] whereby, [...] "A lot of the time it ended up with just Paul playing the piano and Ringo keeping the tempo, and we weren't allowed to play as a band as much." ...|$|E
500|$|I saw the boy getting {{injured in}} his leg, {{and the father}} asking for help. Then I saw him getting injured in his arm, the father. The father was asking the {{ambulances}} to help him, because {{he could see the}} ambulances. I cannot see the ambulance... I wasn't far away, maybe from them [...] face to face about 15 meters, 17 meters. But the father didn't succeed to get the ambulance by waving to them. He looked at me and he said, [...] "Help me." [...] I said, [...] "I cannot, I can't help you." [...] The shooting till then was really heavy... It was really raining bullets, for more than for 45minutes. Then... I hear something, [...] "boom!" [...] Really is coming with a lot of dust. I looked at the boy, I filmed the boy lying down in the father's lap, and the father really, getting really injured, and he was really dizzy. I said, [...] "Oh my god, the boy's got killed, the boy's got killed," [...] I was screaming, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>losing</b> my mind. While I was filming, the boy got killed... I was very afraid, I was very upset, I was crying, and I was remembering my children.... This was the most terrible thing that has happened to me as a journalist.|$|E
6000|$|... "Can't you?" [...] said Ford, innocently, with {{an attempt}} at joviality: [...] "I wish <b>I</b> <b>was</b> like you. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>losing</b> my memory--age, <b>I</b> suppose; only the other day my mate--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No!" [...] he decided, almost roughly. [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>losing</b> myself, Sophy. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>losing</b> {{something}} of my strength every day. Louise doesn't help as she might. Don't stay with me, please. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{beginning to have}} moods, and when they come on <b>I</b> want to <b>be</b> alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are right," [...] she answered, [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>losing</b> my nerve. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> only {{afraid that}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>losing</b> {{something}} else. <b>I</b> haven't {{an ounce of}} battle left in me. I feel that I should like to {{close my eyes and}} wake up in a new world, and start all over again." ...|$|R
500|$|Recording of {{the tracks}} that were to appear on Echo & the Bunnymen began at Conny Plank's studio in Cologne. Both Echo & the Bunnymen and their label, WEA Records, were unhappy {{with the results of}} the Norton {{sessions}} with Palmer playing drums. Keen to record again with de Freitas, the band decided to scrap the Norton sessions and to start recording a new album with Latham who had previously worked with the band on their 1985 single [...] "Bring on the Dancing Horses". The sessions moved from Cologne to ICP Studios in Brussels before returning to Cologne and finishing off at The Workhouse in London and Amazon Studios in Liverpool. The band hoped that the album would be a collection of simple songs; however, Latham was very specific and exacting, and he would work on one song for as long as a month. Recording was also complicated by the star treatment received by McCulloch. This, along with his heavy drinking, alienated him {{from the rest of the}} band. In a 1995 interview, band guitarist Will Sergeant said of McCulloch's treatment, [...] "We just found it all ridiculous. He had people running around behind him, basically wiping his arse." [...] McCulloch later said in a 1997 interview: [...] "I knew <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>losing</b> it. I was on another planet but then I didn't want to be on the one [...] were on." ...|$|E
2500|$|Houston {{gave her}} first {{interview}} {{in seven years}} in September 2009, appearing on Oprah Winfrey's season premiere. The interview was billed as [...] "the most anticipated music interview of the decade". Whitney admitted on the show to using drugs with former husband Bobby Brown, who [...] "laced marijuana with rock cocaine". She told Oprah that before The Bodyguard her drug use was light, but after the film's success {{and the birth of}} her daughter it got heavier, and by 1996 [...] " [...] was an everyday thing... I wasn't happy by that point in time. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>losing</b> myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{constantly}} explaining {{concepts and}} story outlines to interviewers and fans, Turner chose {{to keep the}} thematic basis of In the Absence of Truth quiet. [...] "Through explaining the last two albums time and time again, I just started to become weary of the topic, and I started to feel like <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>losing</b> my connection to {{the music and the}} lyrics simply from having repeated it so many times [...] I feel there's a lot of emphasis these days placed on explaining everything in such a fashion that there's really nothing left for the listener or reader to explore themselves. It's all spelled out," [...] Turner continues. [...] "So it's interesting to leave some of that stuff open-ended so they have to {{do a little bit of}} legwork themselves." [...] He was similarly reticent about revealing much which went into Wavering Radiant, beyond noting that Carl Jung's theories, and dreams, served as inspiration.|$|E
6000|$|... "A saint and a heroine!" [...] said Claude. [...] "You shall know all; for {{you ought}} to know. But you have no news of Tom; and I have none either. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>losing</b> all hope now." ...|$|R
6000|$|Did I {{tell you}} that the {{severity}} of the weather, and the heat of the intolerable furnaces, dry the hair and break the nails of strangers? There is not a complete nail in the whole British suite, and my hair cracks again when I brush it. (<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>losing</b> my hair with great rapidity, and what <b>I</b> don't <b>lose</b> <b>is</b> getting very grey.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my word, Emily," [...] exclaimed the gratified father, [...] "you become {{each other}} so well, that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>losing</b> a prejudice, and begin to believe even a poor man's {{daughter}} may be justified in using such an ornament." ...|$|R
2500|$|As {{a result}} of her altered looks and weight gain from her {{rheumatoid}} arthritis treatment, The New York Times published this statement in 2005, [...] "Rumors began circulating that she was drinking too much. She later said in interviews that she didn't bother correcting the rumors because people in show business hire drunks all the time, but not people who are sick." [...] Turner has had well-publicized problems with alcohol, which she used as an escape from the pain and symptoms of acute rheumatoid arthritis. Turner has admitted that because of her illness, she was in constant unbearable agony and that as a result, the people she was closest to would suffer from it, as she was constantly drinking to relieve the pain and it made her a very difficult person. A few weeks after leaving the production of the play The Graduate in November 2002, Turner was admitted into the Marworth hospital in Waverly, Pennsylvania, for the treatment of alcoholism. [...] "I have no problem with alcohol when I'm working," [...] she explained. [...] "It's when I'm home alone that I can't control my drinking...I was going toward excess. I mean, really! I think <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>losing</b> my control over it. So it pulled me back." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album {{features}} no printed lyrics, but {{it seems}} likely to connect with Isis's past legacy of concept albums, wherein some of the lyrics (such as [...] "She was his queen" [...] from [...] "Dulcinea") relate to past themes. Turner has confirmed {{the presence of a}} concept: [...] "I won't say what the concept is, but I can give you some clues about what inspired it: Hassan-i-Sabbah, the Islamic mystic cult leader, [...] Don Quixote, [...] House of Leaves, and [...] Labyrinths." [...] However; from repeated explanation of what inspired Oceanic and Panopticon, his stance changed. [...] "Through explaining the last two albums time and time again, I just started to become weary of the topic, and I started to feel like <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>losing</b> my connection to the music and the lyrics simply from having repeated it so many times. And for me, personally, it's really important to maintain that connection as much as possible. I feel there's a lot of emphasis these days placed on explaining everything in such a fashion that there's really nothing left for the listener or reader to explore themselves. It's all spelled out. So it's interesting to leave some of that stuff open-ended so they have do to a little bit of legwork themselves." [...] Drummer Aaron Harris explains this further, saying that the album is based “on personal perception of anything [...] and what's true and what's not true.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's just it," [...] she interrupted, quite fiercely. [...] "It <b>is</b> because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> young that <b>I</b> {{want to do}} something.

6000|$|... "Oh, I {{sleep well}} enough. Indeed, I wish I could sleep all the time, so that I {{could not know}} how the world--at least its pleasures and affections--are passing away from me.

5000|$|Like tense, {{aspect is}} a way that verbs {{represent}} time. However, rather than locating an event or state in time, the way tense does, aspect describes [...] "the internal temporal constituency of a situation", or in other words, aspect {{is a way}} [...] "of conceiving {{the flow of the}} process itself". English aspectual distinctions in the past tense include [...] "I went, I used to go, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going, <b>I</b> had gone"; in the present tense [...] "I <b>lose,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>losing,</b> <b>I</b> have lost, <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>losing,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going to lose"; and with the future modal [...] "I will see, <b>I</b> will <b>be</b> seeing, <b>I</b> will have seen, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going to see". What distinguishes these aspects within each tense is not (necessarily) when the event occurs, but how the time in which it occurs is viewed: as complete, ongoing, consequential, planned, etc.|$|R
