25|$|Chelmsford {{realised}} that {{he would}} need to account to the government and to history for the disaster. He quickly fixed blame on Durnford, claiming Durnford disobeyed his orders to fix a proper defensive camp, although there is no evidence such an order was issued and there would <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> time for Durnford to entrench. Further, it had been Chelmsford's decision not to entrench the camp, as {{it was meant to be}} temporary.|$|E
25|$|It is unclear, though, how John {{might have}} {{had access to the}} works of the Rhineland mystics. These works were only {{translated}} into Latin {{in the second half of}} the sixteenth century. This means that copies would <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> easily available for John. In addition, if it is acknowledged that an influence on John was Francisco de Osuna (who clearly cannot have read the Rhineland mystics since they were not known in Spain in the 1520s), then another problem is raised.|$|E

25|$|Among {{his other}} rewards for loyalty, Censorinus {{was allowed to}} buy Cicero's house on the Palatine, which the orator had exerted such strenuous efforts to restore after its {{confiscation}} in connection to his exile. Its value was reckoned at 3,500,000 sesterces. Although the Palatine house, along with Cicero's other confiscated property following his death, was sold ostensibly at public auction, the symbolism of its possession can <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> left to chance. The house next passed to T. Statilius Taurus, whom Cicero notoriously associated with Calvisius.|$|E
25|$|The {{contrast}} between Mao's top field commanders could <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> more sharp, {{but on the}} Long March they worked well together, Lin specializing in feints, masked strategy, surprises, ambushes, flank attacks, pounces from the rear, and stratagems. Peng met the enemy head-on in frontal assaults and fought with such fury that again and again he wiped them out. Peng did not believe a battle well fought unless he managed to replenish—and more than replenish—any losses by seizure of enemy guns and converting prisoners of war to new and loyal recruits to the Red Army.|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} events which {{led up to}} the peaceful dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905 could <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> attained but for the tact and patience of the king himself. He was dethroned on 7 June 1905 by the Storting and renounced the Norwegian throne on 26 October. He declined, indeed, to permit any prince of his house to become king of Norway, but better {{relations between the two countries}} were restored before his death. Oscar II died in Stockholm on 8 December 1907 at 9:10 am.|$|E

25|$|Timesitheus {{served as}} Praetorian Prefect for some {{three years from}} 241 {{until his death in}} 243. The only {{narrative}} source on his term of office is the SHA and, as already noted, the author of the Vita Tres Gordiani could <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> more fulsome in singing his praises, both as the father-in-law of the young emperor and as the protector of the Empire. This generous assessment is supported by two citations of supposed correspondence between Timesitheus and Gordian (probably invented) and a number of topoi familiarly used in Latin historiography to define a worthy servant of the state - i.e. a crackdown on sale of offices by members of the palatini, care for the defence of the frontiers and exemplary behaviour in his capacity as commander of the Praetorian Guard. The favourable view of Timesitheus's term of office entertained by the SHA is not challenged by modern scholars - although the inadequacy of the data is acknowledged.|$|E
25|$|Under {{the first}} Caliph, Abu Bakr, force {{was used to}} prevent unrest and {{rebellion}} from causing {{the collapse of the}} new Islamic state, and the first raids were carried out into the territory of the Sassanid Empire. But the all out attack on the neighboring empires came with the ascension of the second Caliph, Umar. When the new Caliph began his rule in 634, the international situation in the Middle East could <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> more propitious for a new and ambitious power: the region's two traditional main powers, the Byzantine and the Sassanid Empires, had exhausted each other in a conflict that raged for over 20 years. By the 630s, Sassanid Persia had descended into a state of civil war, while Byzantium, under the aging emperor Heraclius, its manpower and resources depleted in the struggle with its old adversary, was struggling to re-establish its authority in its newly re-conquered eastern provinces. The two states were thus in considerable internal turmoil, and unable to either stop the Muslim expansion or to recover from its first blows. It is unknown whether Umar intended from the outset to conquer both the Sassanid and the Byzantine Empire, or simply allowed raids, and then, perceiving their weakness, followed up with full-scale invasion.|$|E

500|$|Reporting on Calcraft's {{visit to}} Dundee {{to perform an}} {{execution}} in that city in April 1873, The Times newspaper observed that [...] "if their visitor had been a Royal personage, or an eminent statesman he could <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> treated with greater consideration". They further reported that Calcraft arrived with only one piece of hand luggage, a carpet bag containing [...] "a new rope, a white cap, and some pinioning straps".|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to Zuckerman's version, the Primary Chronicle and the later Kiev Chronicle place Oleg's grave in Kiev, {{where it could}} be seen {{at the time of}} the compilation of these documents. Furthermore, scholars have pointed out that if Oleg succeeded Rurik in 879 (as the East Slavic chronicles assert), he could <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> active almost 70 years later, unless he had a life-span otherwise unheard of in medieval annals. To solve these difficulties, it has been proposed that the pagan monarch-priests of Rus' used the hereditary title of helgu, standing for [...] "holy" [...] in the Norse language, and that Igor and others held this title.|$|E
500|$|The Soviet Union was keen {{not to be}} left out. On 23 August 1936, {{it agreed}} to the Non-Intervention Agreement, and this was {{followed}} by a decree from Stalin banning exports of war material to Spain, thereby bringing the USSR into line with the Western Powers. Soviet foreign policy considered collective security against German fascism a priority [...] and the Comintern had agreed a similar approach in 1934. It walked a thin line between pleasing France and not being seen to hinder the World revolution and communist ideals. This was also {{the time of the first}} significant trials of the Old Bolsheviks in Russia. Soviet press and opposition groups were entirely against non-intervention; Soviet actions could <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> further from the goal of spreading the revolution.|$|E

500|$|The {{entrance}} immediately {{leads to}} a [...] long steep stairway and then down on to a corridor which heads west. The corridor ends in a straight vertical shaft, {{at the top of}} which is the so-called upper corridor, an unfinished passage which goes south {{toward the center of the}} pyramid. At the bottom of the shaft is a T-shaped crossway. To the left, this crossway leads south to the lower corridor, half-way of which is a narrow stairway, so narrow that a sarcophagus could <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> passed through it. The lower corridor then finishes in the king's burial chamber. In this area of the stairway, Barsanti drew another gallery leading above the burial chamber, but this gallery is absent in Reisner's and Fisher's notes. To the right of the T-shaped crossway is a U-shaped gallery system. The ground plan of the gallery system resembles that of a comb, comprising rows of chambers, totalling 32, which were possibly destined to be storage rooms for the gravegoods. The gallery proved to be [...] "clean and empty, as if the workmen had only left".|$|E
500|$|The {{timing and}} {{location}} of the launch event– {{in the middle of}} winter, {{on the top of a}} snow- and ice-covered hill– later prompted criticism even from Sinclair executives, who admitted off the record that spring conditions might have been better for a vehicle with so little protection from the British climate. The Financial Times called it [...] "the worst possible timing to launch what was proclaimed to be a serious, road-going vehicle". Sinclair's biographer Rodney Dale describes it as [...] "a calculated (or miscalculated) risk", pointing out that production was already underway, details were beginning to leak out to the press and [...] "the launch could <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> held up until the possibility of a bright spring day". He justified the choice of January as being necessitated by a need to release the C5 [...] "as soon as possible lest the erroneous speculation should have done more harm than good". Rob Gray offers an alternative explanation, that the launch date had been brought forward because Sinclair's development funds were running low.|$|E
500|$|Nancy Mitford's father, David Bertram Ogilvy Freeman-Mitford, was Bertie Mitford's second son, born on 13 March 1878. After {{several years}} as a tea planter in Ceylon he fought in the Boer War of 1899–1902 and was {{severely}} wounded. In 1903 he became engaged to Sydney Bowles, the elder daughter of Thomas Gibson Bowles, known as [...] "Tap", [...] a journalist, editor and magazine proprietor whose publications included Vanity Fair and The Lady. [...] The couple were married on 16 February 1904, after which they rented a house in Graham Street in West London. [...] Bowles provided his son-in-law with a job, as business manager of The Lady magazine. David {{had little interest in}} reading and knew nothing of business; thus, according to Nancy Mitford's biographer Selena Hastings, [...] "a less congenial post... could <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> imagined". He remained in this position for ten years. The couple's first child, a daughter, was born on 28 November 1904; they had intended to call her Ruby, but after she was born they changed their minds and named her Nancy.|$|E

500|$|Newspaper {{accounts}} of the gallant charge had been given wide circulation in England by the time Cardigan's ship berthed {{at the port of}} Folkestone on 13 January 1855 and the town offered him a rapturous welcome. In London he was mobbed by an enthusiastic crowd and on 16 January at Queen Victoria's invitation he was received at Windsor to explain to her and Prince Albert the details of the battle. Victoria noted how [...] "modestly" [...] he presented his story, but this reticence was absent in his public appearances: on 5 February, he gave a highly exaggerated account of his participation in the charge at a banquet held in his honour at the Mansion House, London. On 8 February, at a speech in his home town of Northampton, he went even further, describing how he had shared the privations of his men by living the [...] "whole time in a common tent" [...] and how, after the charge, he had rallied his troops and pursued the fleeing enemy artillerymen as far as the Tchernaya river. As his biographer Saul David points out, [...] "a more misleading account of his own exploits could <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> given".|$|E
500|$|Early in {{the morning}} of 10 January 1914, McKinlay records, [...] "a severe shudder shook the whole ship" [...] as the ice {{attacked}} the hull. Bartlett, still hoping to save his ship, gave orders to lighten her by removing all accumulated snow from the decks. He also ordered all hands to have warm clothing ready. At 6.45 in the evening a loud bang indicated that the hull had been punctured; Bartlett went immediately to the engine room and observed water pouring in through a gash [...] long. There was no possibility that the pumps could deal with the inflow, and the captain gave the order to abandon ship. Weather conditions, says McKinlay, could <b>hardly</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> worse, but the crew and staff worked throughout the night, in pitch darkness and driving snow, to add to the quantities of rations and equipment already stored on the ice. Bartlett remained on board until the last moments, playing loud music on the ship's Victrola. At 3:15 p.m. on 11 January, Bartlett put on Chopin's Funeral March as a final salute to the ship, and stepped off. Karluk sank within minutes, her yardarms snapping off as she disappeared through the narrow hole in the ice. McKinlay took stock of the stranded party: 22 men, one woman, two children, 16 dogs and a cat.|$|E
