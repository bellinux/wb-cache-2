When asked about his {{interpretation}} on the character, McCormack commented that his <b>first</b> <b>instinct</b> was to make Ted Lewis more alien, sounding like Spock. The film was critically and financially unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|These events led {{rapidly to}} Mary's defeat and {{imprisonment}} in Loch Leven Castle. The Scottish lords {{forced her to}} abdicate in favour of her son James, who {{had been born in}} June 1566. James was taken to Stirling Castle to be raised as a Protestant. Mary escaped from Loch Leven in 1568 but after another defeat fled across the border into England, where she had once been assured of support from Elizabeth. Elizabeth's <b>first</b> <b>instinct</b> was to restore her fellow monarch; but she and her council instead chose to play safe. Rather than risk returning Mary to Scotland with an English army or sending her to France and the Catholic enemies of England, they detained her in England, where she was imprisoned for the next nineteen years.|$|E

5000|$|Love in the 4th Dimension is {{the debut}} studio album by British indie rock band The Big Moon, {{released}} on 7 April 2017 by Fiction Records. The album was recorded at Eastcote Studios in London with producer Catherine Marks. The album was recorded across 12 days so the band could go with their <b>first</b> <b>instincts</b> musically. Prior to the album's release the tracks [...] "Cupid", [...] "Silent Movie Susie", [...] "Formidable" [...] and [...] "Sucker" [...] were released as singles, {{the latter of}} which being a re-recording of the band's debut single. The band is set to start a European tour to celebrate the album's release starting on 20 April 2017.|$|R
25|$|Laurents {{decided to}} develop a story with a similar {{character}} at its center, but was unsure what other elements to add. He recalled a creative writing instructor named Robert E. Short, who felt {{he had a good}} ear for dialogue and had encouraged him to write plays. His <b>first</b> <b>instinct</b> was to create a crisis between his leading lady and her college professor, but he decided her passion needed to be politics, not writing. What evolved was a male character who had a way with words but no strong inclination to apply himself to a career using them.|$|E
25|$|Lütjens' <b>first</b> <b>instinct</b> was {{to attempt}} to outrun the British ships, {{scrupulously}} obeying his orders. He became even more reluctant to accept battle once the lead enemy vessel was identified as Hood. Even after Hood began to fire on the two ships and {{it became obvious that}} an engagement was inevitable, Lütjens was reluctant to return fire. He ordered his chief yeoman to signal to Prinz Eugen to open fire on the lead enemy ship, but not Bismarck, much to the exasperation of Captain Lindemann, who had the prospect of suffering another disagreement with the Admiral.|$|E
500|$|Rumors {{circulated}} {{once again}} when Ciara released a viral video [...] "Basic Instinct (U Got Me)" [...] {{to kick off}} promotion for her album of the same name. Ciara addressed claims that remarks in the song were referring to Hilson {{in an interview with}} Rap-Up, stating that the song was dedicated to her haters, gave her a chance to express herself, and was about trusting her <b>first</b> <b>instinct</b> on everything.|$|E
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} and produced in six months. Alex Patterson’s recording of sounds whilst touring the world, straight to Ableton, using his iPhone {{was one of}} main reasons for its speedy completion. While the duo went out on tour, Paterson was collecting field recordings {{during the process of}} making this record. This allowed the duo for [...] "valuable moments of spontaneous creative laptop productivity" [...] while on the road. Patterson describes this album as their [...] "most ambient album yet" [...] and Thomas Fehlmann also comments on how the pair trusted their <b>first</b> <b>instincts</b> and allowed the ideas to flow freely and said that they don't intend to rehash old chill out vibes.|$|R

50|$|Things take a {{dramatic}} {{turn on a}} trip to London. Lizzie, out of fear of Mr Camperdown, keeps her diamonds with her in a conspicuous strongbox. One night, at an inn, the strongbox is stolen and everybody assumes the jewellery is lost. As it turns out, Lizzie had taken the gems out and put them under her pillow, but acting on her <b>first</b> <b>instincts,</b> she perjures herself when she has to report the theft to the magistrate, thinking that she can sell the diamonds and let the robbers take the blame. Suspicion falls on both Lizzie and Lord George, acting either together or separately. In any case, the thieves, aided by Lizzie's disloyal maid, Patience Crabstick, try again and succeed in their second attempt. Lizzie feigns illness and takes to her bed. Lady Glencora Palliser pays Lizzie a visit to offer her sympathy.|$|R
500|$|Other Coward works {{produced}} in the mid-to-late 1920s included the plays Easy Virtue (1926), a drama about a divorcée's clash with her snobbish in-laws; The Queen Was in the Parlour, a Ruritanian romance; This Was a Man (1926), a comedy about adulterous aristocrats; The Marquise (1927), an eighteenth-century costume drama; Home Chat (1927), a comedy about a married woman's fidelity; and the revues On with the Dance (1925) and This Year of Grace (1928). None of these shows has entered the regular repertoire, but the last introduced one of Coward's best-known songs, [...] "A Room with a View". His biggest failure in this period was the play Sirocco (1927), which concerns free love among the wealthy. It starred Ivor Novello, of whom Coward said, [...] "the two most beautiful {{things in the world}} are Ivor's profile and my mind". Theatregoers hated the play, showing violent disapproval at the curtain calls and spitting at Coward as he left the theatre. Coward later said of this flop, [...] "My <b>first</b> <b>instinct</b> was to leave England immediately, but this seemed too craven a move, and also too gratifying to my enemies, whose numbers had by then swollen in our minds to practically the entire population of the British Isles." ...|$|E
500|$|The group {{initially}} invited Feldmann to hear its demos, and {{he suggested}} that the band regroup at his studio {{the next day to}} make a fresh start. The next day, the group wrote three songs, including the lead single [...] "Bored to Death". As the band continued to write and record, the trio chose to shelve their earlier recordings and proceeded to write 28 songs in a period of 3–4 weeks. Half of these songs were chosen to be put on the finalized album, in addition to two joke songs. Barker fought for all 28 songs to be on the album, as he felt fans had waited long enough for more new music. The trio, as well as Feldmann, regularly stayed in the studio for up to 18 hours a day. The band members would arrive at the studio with no plan for what to work on for the day. They would then write several songs in only a few hours, aiming to complete them {{by the end of the}} night. Feldmann asked the members to consider what Blink-182, as a group, are all about, to inspire the songwriting. He would encourage the musicians to write with speed, which Hoppus admitted could be frustrating. [...] "John was like, 'Okay: We've got the song structure. Write lyrics. Go in there and sing it. Go in there and sing it.' Sometimes, I was like, 'I'm not ready to sing!' (and Feldmann would reply) 'No. Go write something great right now!'" [...] Barker was more supportive of this method based on his work with the Transplants, which had a similar speedy approach. [...] "I always feel like your <b>first</b> <b>instinct</b> is your best," [...] Barker remarked.|$|E
500|$|De Boer {{felt that}} the {{producers}} {{did a good job}} with involving Ezri {{over the course of the}} seventh season, but not to the extent that it detracted from the more established members of the main cast. However, there was one part of the season where she was concerned that the fans would suffer from [...] "Ezri overload". But she {{felt that the}} character had a real story arc and character evolution as the season went by. She said that she did not want Ezri to remain the same [...] "young and confused" [...] person that she was in her first appearances, which was something that the writers and producers agreed with. She said that [...] "As time went on, you saw that Ezri was intelligent, that she was endearing and a good person. She became a more complicated character than you might have thought in her first few episodes." [...] She praised specific episodes which evolved the character, such as [...] "The Siege of AR-558" [...] which required Ezri to draw upon Dax's past experiences, as otherwise she would have been completely out of her element. De Boer also enjoyed [...] "" [...] as the episode showed the change in Ezri from before she was joined with the Dax symbiont, and she thought that the events portrayed in [...] "" [...] were [...] "fascinating". As she approached the end of Deep Space Nine, de Boer addressed the rumors of her joining , saying that [...] "My <b>first</b> <b>instinct</b> would be to say no. I would need to feel there was a reason for Ezri to be on Voyager". She was interviewed at the series wrap party after completing filming on the final episode, [...] "What You Leave Behind", and said, [...] "The last episode was very emotional, especially on the last day... I couldn't believe that a season had gone by already. I realized all the people I'd grown close to must be feeling it much more because they'd been doing it 7 years. I cried." ...|$|E
5000|$|Kozelek would {{record the}} album's songs quickly after writing them, noting, [...] "I don't make demos. I don't have the {{interest}} or the energy or the time. Demos are {{something you do}} {{in the early stages of}} your career, but when you get going, you just go in and record the song. With this record, I wanted to give my <b>first</b> <b>instincts</b> a chance without shooting them down immediately, which I sometimes do. Songs like [...] "Song For Richard Collopy" [...] and [...] "Not Much Rhymes With Everything's Awesome All the Time" [...] were very impulsive, even my engineers were looking at me like, [...] "What in the fuck are you doing?" [...] And that's exactly the reaction I wanted. I didn't want to put myself, or anyone else, asleep with another quintessential Mark Kozelek album." ...|$|R
6000|$|The American {{does not}} {{consider}} little matters of descent, though by this time he ought to know all about [...] "damnable heredity." [...] As a general rule he keeps himself very far from the negro, and says things about him that are not pretty. There are six million negroes, more or less, in the States, and they are increasing. The American, once having made them citizens, cannot unmake them. He says, in his newspapers, {{they ought to be}} elevated by education. He is trying this, but {{it is likely to be}} a long job, because black blood is much more adhesive than white, and throws back with annoying persistence. When the negro gets religion he returns directly as a hiving bee to the <b>first</b> <b>instincts</b> of his people. Just now a wave of religion is sweeping over some of the Southern States.|$|R
60|$|Sympathy {{with pain}} there will, of course, always be. It {{is one of}} the <b>first</b> <b>instincts</b> of man. The animals which are individual, the higher animals, that is to say, share it with us. But it must be remembered that while sympathy with joy intensifies the sum of joy in the world, sympathy with pain does not really {{diminish}} the amount of pain. It may make man better able to endure evil, but the evil remains. Sympathy with consumption does not cure consumption; that is what Science does. And when Socialism has solved the problem of poverty, and Science solved the problem of disease, the area of the sentimentalists will be lessened, and the sympathy of man will be large, healthy, and spontaneous. Man will have joy in the contemplation of the joyous life of others.|$|R
2500|$|When suspicious, a Kangal {{will stand}} with its tail and ears erect and give an alarm call, inciting the sheep to gather around it for protection. The Kangal’s <b>first</b> <b>instinct</b> {{is to place}} itself between the {{perceived}} threat and the sheep or master. Once the sheep are safely behind it, the Kangal confronts the intruder. When faced with a wolf, the Kangal sometimes is successful in intimidating the enemy, but it will resort to a physical confrontation if the predator stands its ground. Specialized wolf killers are known as [...] "kurtçul kangal" [...] in their homeland.|$|E
2500|$|Daroff Design, Inc. was {{in charge}} of decorating the interiors. Daroff Design and Loews decided International style would not provide the {{atmosphere}} hotel guests sought and predominantly used the Art Deco style instead. Critics criticized the use of Art Deco, saying Daroff Design did not understand the International style and cheapened the original building. However, one architecture critic said [...] "Daroff's flamboyant approach allows Howe and Lescaze's contribution to have its own identity, and Daroff to have hers." [...] Karen Daroff said, [...] "Our <b>first</b> <b>instinct</b> was to stay with the minimal design of the International style but we did need to soften it. We took almost a cinematic approach, using Hollywood's view of the '20s and '30s, juxtaposed with the abstract geometry." ...|$|E
2500|$|The foureye {{butterflyfish}} {{gets its}} name from a large dark spot on the rear portion of {{each side of the}} body. This spot is surrounded by a brilliant white ring, resembling an eyespot. A black vertical bar on the head runs through the true eye, making it hard to see. This can result in a predator thinking the fish is bigger than it is, and confusing the back end with the front end. The butterflyfish's <b>first</b> <b>instinct</b> when threatened is to flee, putting the false eyespot closer to the predator than the head. [...] Most predators aim for the eyes, and this false eyespot tricks the predator into believing that the fish will flee tail first. When escape is not possible, the butterflyfish will sometimes turn to face its aggressor, head lowered and spines fully erect, like a bull about to charge. [...] This may serve to intimidate the other animal or may remind the predator that the butterflyfish is too spiny to make a comfortable meal.|$|E

2500|$|With {{about two}} {{minutes left in the}} half, the Dolphins finally managed to get a good drive going on their next possession. Marino {{completed}} seven out of nine passes, the last one being a 30-yard pass to tight end Joe Rose, to reach the 49ers' 12-yard line. However, San Francisco's defense tightened up on the next three plays, forcing two incompletions and a completed pass for no gain, and Miami was forced to settle for von Schamann's second field goal of the game to cut their deficit to 28–13 with 12 seconds left in the half. Then Miami caught a break as the 49ers botched the ensuing kickoff. San Francisco lineman Guy McIntyre received von Schamann's short kick and was about to down the ball, but then changed his mind at the last second and decided to return it. This {{turned out to be a}} big mistake; McIntyre fumbled while being leveled by rookie Joe Carter, and Jim Jensen recovered the ball for Miami at the 49ers' 12-yard line. After that, von Schamann kicked his third field goal on the last play of the half, cutting the score to 28–16. [...] "I can laugh about the play now, but it wasn't funny at the time," [...] McIntyre said after the game. [...] "My <b>first</b> <b>instinct</b> when I got the ball was to fall down. Then I heard everyone yelling, 'Get up! Get up!' So I got up, and here comes someone sneaking underneath me, and he hit the ball." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gail Bederman takes a {{different}} view in her Manliness and Civilization: A Cultural History of Gender and Race in the United States, 1880–1917. There she describes how various people of the time either challenged or upheld the idea that [...] "civilization" [...] is predicated on white masculinity. She closes with a chapter on 1912's Tarzan of the Apes because the story's protagonist is, according to her, the ultimate male {{by the standards of}} 1912 white America. Bederman does note that Tarzan, [...] "an instinctivily chivalrous Anglo-Saxon", does not engage in sexual violence, renouncing his [...] "masculine impulse to rape." [...] However, she also notes that not only does Tarzan kill black man Kulonga in revenge for killing his ape mother (a stand-in for his biological white mother) by hanging him, [...] "lyncher Tarzan" [...] actually enjoys killing black people, the cannibalistic Mbongans, for example. Bederman, in fact, reminds readers that when Tarzan first introduces himself to Jane, he does so as [...] "Tarzan, the killer of beasts and many black men." [...] The novel climaxes with Tarzan saving Jane—who in the original novel is not British, but a white woman from Baltimore, Maryland—from a black ape rapist. When he leaves the jungle and sees [...] "civilized" [...] Africans farming, his <b>first</b> <b>instinct</b> is to kill them just for being black. [...] "Like the lynch victims reported in the Northern press, Tarzan's victims—cowards, cannibals, and despoilers of white womanhood—lack all manhood. Tarzan's lynchings thus prove him the superior man." ...|$|E

Not realizing that they shifted in space and time, the siblings split, while looking for directions.
