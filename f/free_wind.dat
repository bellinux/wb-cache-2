Most consonants in human speech (e.g., the sounds of f, v, s, z, both voiced and unvoiced th, Scottish and German ch) are characterised by distinctive noises, and even vowels are not entirely noise <b>free.</b> <b>Wind</b> instruments include the whizzing or hissing sounds of air breaking against {{the edges of the}} mouthpiece, while bowed instruments produce audible rubbing noises that contribute, when the instrument is poor or the player unskilful, to what is perceived as a poor tone.

For 38 severe typhoons attacking the Japanese Islands during the period from 1951 to 1970, the pressure fields are objectively analyzed, fitting to the Schloemer's equation, and the posi-tion of pressure center and the parameters of pressure field are estimated. The results are sum-merized and the new Standard Project Typhoon is synthesized. The method to obtain surfacewind distribution of the Standard Project Typhoon is also proposed and two examples of compari-sons of estimated friction <b>free</b> <b>winds</b> with the observed surface winds are described...|$|R

These binaries are composed of a massive star and a compact object, possibly a young pulsar. The gamma-ray emission would be due to particle acceleration at the collision site between the relativistic pulsar wind and the stellar wind of the massive star. Part of the emission may also originate from inverse Compton scattering of stellar photons on the unshocked (<b>free)</b> pulsar <b>wind.</b> Aims: The purpose of this work is to constrain the bulk Lorentz factor of the pulsar wind and the shock geometry in the compact pulsar wind nebula scenario for LS 5039 and LSI + 61 ° 303 by computing the unshocked wind emission and comparing it to observations. Methods: Anisotropic inverse Compton losses equations are derived and applied to the <b>free</b> pulsar <b>wind</b> in binaries. The unshocked wind spectra seen by the observer are calculated {{taking into account the}} γ-γ absorption and the shock geometry. Results: A pulsar wind composed of monoenergetic pairs produces a typical sharp peak at an energy which depends on the bulk Lorentz factor and whose amplitude depends {{on the size of the}} emitting region. This emission from the <b>free</b> pulsar <b>wind</b> is found to be strong and difficult to avoid in LS 5039 and LSI + 61 ° 303.

60|$|The {{land near}} Cape Horn, however, {{is well worth}} seeing, {{especially}} Staten Land.

On our starboard beam, like a pile of glaciers in Switzerland, lay this Staten Land, gleaming in snow-white barrenness and solitude. Unnumbered white albatross were skimming the sea near by, and clouds of smaller white wings fell through the air like snow-flakes. High, towering in their own turbaned snows, the far-inland pinnacles loomed up, like the border of some other world. Flashing walls and crystal battlements, like the diamond watch-towers along heaven's furthest frontier.|$|E

60|$|The {{departure}} of the boat was excellently timed. Had it left {{the side of the}} ship while the Arabs on the raft were unoccupied, and at a little distance, it would have been exposed to their fire; for at least a dozen of those who boarded had muskets; whereas the boat now glided away to leeward, while they were busy in getting up her side, or were so near the ship as {{not to be able to}} see the launch at all. When Paul Powis, who was looking astern through a crevice, saw the first Arab on the deck of the Montauk, the launch was already near a cable's length from her, running with a fresh and <b>free</b> <b>wind</b> into one of the numerous little channels that intersected the naked banks of sand. The unusual construction of the boat, with its enclosed roof, and the circumstance that no one was visible on board her, had the effect to keep the barbarians passive, until distance put her beyond the reach of danger. A few muskets were discharged, but they were fired at random, and in the bravado of a semi-savage state of feeling.|$|E
60|$|The {{first hour}} after the action ceased, was one of great {{exertion}} and anxiety to our admiral. He called the Chloe alongside by signal, and, attended by Wycherly and his own quarter-masters, Galleygo, who went without orders, and the Bowlderos who were unhurt, he shifted his flag to that frigate. Then he immediately commenced passing from vessel to vessel, in order to ascertain the actual condition of his command. The Achilles detained him some time, and he was near her, or to leeward, when the wind shifted; which was bringing him to windward in the present stale of things. Of this advantage he availed himself, by urging the different ships off as fast as possible; and long before the sun was in the meridian, all the English vessels were making {{the best of their}} way towards the land, with the intention of fetching into Plymouth if possible; if not, into the nearest and best anchorage to leeward.

The proud ship did indeed present a sight to make a seaman melancholy; for to the only regular sail that stood, the foresail, by this time was added a lower studding-sail, imperfectly rigged, and which would not resist a fresh puff, while a very inartificial jury-topmast supported a topgallant-sail, {{that could only be}} carried in a <b>free</b> <b>wind.</b> Aft, preparations were making of a more permanent nature, it is true. The upper part of the mainmast had been cut away, as low as the steerage-deck where an arrangement had been made to step a spare topmast. The spar itself was lying on the deck rigged, and a pair of sheers were in readiness to be hoisted, in order to sway it up; but night approaching, the men had been broken off, to rig the yards, bend the sails, and to fit the other spars it was intended to use, postponing the last act, that of sending all up, until morning.|$|E
