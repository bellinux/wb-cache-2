During the American slavery period, cotton root bark was used in folk remedies as an abortifacient, that is, to induce a miscarriage. <b>Gossypol</b> was one of the many substances found {{in all parts of the}} cotton plant and it was described by the scientists as 'poisonous pigment'. It also appears to inhibit the development of sperm or even restrict the mobility of the sperm.

50|$|For {{some time}} it was {{believed}} that <b>gossypol</b> was merely a waste product produced during the processing of cottonseed products. Extensive studies have shown that <b>gossypol</b> has other functions. Many of the more popular studies on <b>gossypol</b> discuss how it can act as a male contraceptive. <b>Gossypol</b> has also been linked to causing hypokalemic paralysis. Hypokalemic paralysis is a disease characterized by muscle weakness or paralysis with a matching fall in potassium levels in the blood. Hypokalemic paralysis associated with <b>gossypol</b> in-take usually occurs in March, when vegetables are in short supply, and in September, when people are sweating a lot. This side effect of <b>gossypol</b> in-take is very rare however. <b>Gossypol</b> induced hypokalemic paralysis is easily treatable with potassium repletion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gossypol</b> has {{a yellow}} pigment and {{is found in}} cotton plants. It occurs mainly in the root and/or seeds of {{different}} species of cotton plants. <b>Gossypol</b> can have various chemical structures. It can exist in three forms: <b>gossypol,</b> <b>gossypol</b> acetic acid, and <b>gossypol</b> formic acid. All of these forms have very similar biological properties. <b>Gossypol</b> {{is a type of}} aldehyde, meaning that it has a formyl group. The formation of <b>gossypol</b> occurs through an isoprenoid pathway. Isoprenoid pathways are common among secondary metabolites. Gossypol's main function in the cotton plant is to act as an enzyme inhibitor. An example of gossypol's enzyme inhibition is its ability to inhibit nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-linked enzymes of Trypanosoma cruzi. Trypanosoma cruzi is a parasite which causes Chaga's disease.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gossypol</b> is {{a natural}} phenol derived from the cotton plant (genus Gossypium). <b>Gossypol</b> is a {{phenolic}} aldehyde that permeates cells and acts as an inhibitor for several dehydrogenase enzymes. It is a yellow pigment.|$|E
50|$|Among other things, it {{has been}} tested as a male oral {{contraceptive}} in China. In addition to its putative contraceptive properties, <b>gossypol</b> has also long been known to possess antimalarial properties. Other researchers are investigating the anticancer properties of <b>gossypol.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s, the Chinese {{government}} began researching {{the use of}} <b>gossypol</b> as a contraceptive. Their studies involved over 10,000 subjects, and continued for over a decade.

50|$|<b>Gossypol</b> is {{also under}} {{investigation}} {{as a possible}} chemotherapy drug, especially in its R- state. It is currently believed that <b>gossypol</b> in itself will not kill cancerous cells; however, it changes the chemistry within the cancer cell and makes it more susceptible to traditional chemotherapy drugs.

50|$|<b>Gossypol</b> is a toxic, yellow, polyphenolic {{compound}} {{produced by}} cotton {{and other members}} of the order Malvaceae, such as okra. This naturally occurring coloured compound is found in tiny glands in the seed, leaf, stem, tap root bark, and root of the cotton plant. The adaptive function of the compound facilitates natural insect resistance.The three key steps of refining, bleaching, and deodorization in producing finished oil act to eliminate the <b>gossypol</b> level. Ferric chloride is often used to decolorize cotton seed oil.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gossypol</b> is a terpenoid {{aldehyde}} {{which is}} formed metabolically through acetate via the isoprenoid pathway. Sesquiterpene dimer undergoes a radical coupling reaction to form <b>gossypol.</b> The biosynthesis begins when geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP) and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) are combined {{to make the}} sesquiterpene precursor farnesyl diphosphate (FPP). Cadinyl cation (1) is oxidized to 2 by (+)-d-cadinene synthase. The (+)-d-cadinene (2) is involved in making the basic aromatic sesquiterpene unit, homigossypol, by oxidation, which generates the 3 (8-hydroxy-d-cadinene) {{with the help of}} (+)-d-cadinene 8-hyroxylase. Compound 3 goes through various oxidative processes to make 4 (deoxyhemigossypol), which is oxidized by one electron into hemigossypol (5, 6, 7) and then undergoes a phenolic oxidative coupling, ortho to the phenol groups, to form <b>gossypol</b> (8). The coupling is catalyzed by a hydrogen peroxide-dependent peroxidise enzyme, which results in the final product.|$|E

50|$|A 1929 {{investigation}} in Jiangxi showed correlation between low fertility in males {{and use of}} crude cottonseed oil for cooking. The compound causing the contraceptive effect {{was determined to be}} <b>gossypol.</b>|$|E
50|$|However, <b>gossypol</b> {{also had}} serious flaws. The studies also {{discovered}} an abnormally {{high rate of}} hypokalemia among subjects. Hypokalemia — low blood potassium levels — causes symptoms of fatigue, muscle weakness, and at its most extreme, paralysis. In addition, about 7% of subjects reported effects on their digestive systems, and about 12% had increased fatigue. Most subjects recovered after stopping treatment and taking potassium supplements. The same study showed taking potassium supplements during <b>gossypol</b> treatment did not prevent hypokalemia in primates. The potassium deficiency {{may also be a}} result of the Chinese diet or genetic predisposition.|$|E
50|$|Food {{and animal}} {{agricultural}} industries must manage cotton-derivative product levels to avoid toxicity. For example, only ruminant microflora can digest <b>gossypol,</b> {{but only to}} a certain level, and cottonseed oil must be refined.|$|E

50|$|A {{research}} team at Texas A&M University has genetically engineered cotton plants that contain very little <b>gossypol</b> in the seed, but still contain the compound in the stems and leaves. This maintains protection against non-seed pests and diseases, while allowing the seed {{to be used}} for oil and meal for human consumption. The plants are modified by RNA interference, shutting down the genes for <b>gossypol</b> production in the seed, while leaving them unaffected {{in the rest of the}} plant. The resulting gossypol-free cottonseed is then suitable as a high-quality protein source suitable for consumption not only by cattle, but also by humans. Protein makes up 23% of the cottonseed.|$|E

50|$|Gossypieae is a {{tribe of}} the Malvoideae {{subfamily}} of flowering plants. It includes the cotton (Gossypium) and related plants.

50|$|<b>Gossypol</b> has proapoptotic properties, {{probably}} due to the regulation of the Bax and Bcl2 genes. It also reversibly inhibits calcineurin and binds to calmodulin.
