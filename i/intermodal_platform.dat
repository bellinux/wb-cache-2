40|$|The European Union "White {{paper on}} {{transports}} 2010 - 2020 " claims for a modal shift in {{transportation of goods}} from road to railway. To reach this result, Italy needs both an improvement in railway systems {{and the use of}} long freight trains, {{in order to reduce the}} shipping costs. This paper presents an assessment of the railways connecting the ports of Savona and Vado with Piedmont. A renovated interest regards these linkages since the joint-venture (composed by Port Authority and APM Terminals - a division of Maersk Group) which is building a new <b>intermodal</b> <b>platform</b> in Vado, foresees that about 40 % of its freights flows will be transferred inland by train. The aim of the study is therefore to define some operative solutions able to improve the capacity of these lines, providing a sufficient number of available train-paths for ensuring to the railway terminals at the ports of Savona and Vado a steady operation during the 24 hours. Several scenarios are analysed starting from a baseline, evaluating the benefits of innovative solutions like the use of relatively long freight trains (slighter shorter than 600 metres), the improvement of the signalling systems and the setting up of new crossing arrangements between long freight trains and passenger ones. The sum of these solutions gives an improvement in capacity near to 100 %. This study has been carried out making use of the simulation package OpenTrack. Numerical data generated by this tool have been then post-processed with a Microsoft Excel algorithm (internally developed) in order to obtain the trains headways and, then, to produce some feasible timetables. The latter are therefore discussed and commented, thus finally drawing some figures for the capacity of each scenari...|$|E
40|$|Globalization of the world’s economy, containerization, intermodalism and {{specialization}} have reshaped {{transport systems}} and the industries that are considered crucial for the international distribution of goods such as the port industry. Simultaneously, economies of location, economies of scope, economies of scale, optimization of production factors, and clustering of industries have triggered port regionalization and inland integration of port services especially those provided by container terminals. In this integration dry ports have emerged as a vital <b>intermodal</b> <b>platform</b> for the effective and efficient distribution of containerized cargo. Dry ports have enabled port and hinterland expansion increasing the competitiveness of container terminals at seaports. In consequence, container terminals and dry ports are establishing formal and informal relationships to strengthen the competitiveness of their hinterlands and to improve {{their role in the}} physical distribution of goods. This study assesses the characteristics of relationships between container terminals and dry ports. Such assessment is conducted based on a set of relationship characteristics proposed in a relationship assessment model for customer/supplier, in which dry ports are given the role of suppliers of port services to container terminals. In addition, the research assesses the impact of the relationships between container terminals and dry ports on inter-port competition. The main findings of the research led to conclude relationships between container terminals and dry ports are characterized by medium mutuality, low particularity, low co-operation, low conflict, low intensity, low interpersonal inconsistency, high power/dependence and medium trust. Additionally, it was concluded that such relationship characteristics impact inter-port competition in two main ways. In one hand by driving container terminals to maximize the utilization of dry port’s capabilities such as container transport/delivery, container storage, customs clearance, information systems and intermodal connections to industrial clusters. On the other hand, by constructing channels of interaction through which dry port’s benefits for hinterlands such as increase of container terminal capacity, reduction of road congestion, increase of modal shift and hinterland expansion are used as leverage in competition for containerized cargo...|$|E

However, most actions are started by public authorities without {{taking into account the}} impacts of the new organizational schemas in the existing distribution enterprises' organization. This paper sets out to show that urban logistics approaches are currently important with reference to the noise and pollution in city center. To this end, we present the success experience of Cityporto (Padoua) in Italy. Cityporto is a service which makes deliveries in city centre by using GPL and electric lorries. So, the service is considered as less polluting as a conventional approach. In this context, it allows a delivery at any time of the day, also in the Limited Traffic Zone which is closed at certain hours of the day. This is based on the findings from an exploratory qualitative approach. Documentary analysis several interviews have be made. These concern three internal stakeholders of Interporto di Padova (the company which manages the <b>intermodal</b> <b>platform</b> of Padova, in charge of Cityporto) and one member of Padova's Municipality (which promote the project). The results of this case study show that environmental aspect is one of the foundations of the project, but the economic continuity has to be first ensured. Indeed, the preservation of this service on the long term is subjected to its solvency. Moreover, its success is associated to the recognition by employees, and also customers. With regard to the collected information, it is possible to propose a balanced scorecard, where three axes emerged in connexion with economic, environmental and social dimensions. The paper makes a contribution to the evaluation and measurement of city urban logistics using a success story that has been developed from the practitioner perspective. This experience could provide a basis for further practices in Italy and other European countries. In conclusion, the proposed case study is presented for its academic, policy and managerial implications. This experience conceptualises city logistics in relation with the Sustainable Development, setting the main objectives and steps of urban planning for freight distribution and logistics issues.

40|$|The {{transport}} of hazardous substances {{is an economic}} activity essential for goods’ transference chain. However, the risk in transporting hazardous materials {{is related to the}} occur of accidents causing environmental damages and public health dangerous consequences. A quite recent Italian example is the Viareggio accident (2010), which involved a train with tank cars containing liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) which caused more than thirty deaths. This paper describes the safety state in the Varese district (an area of northern Italy with a very high population density and industrial activities), with the aim at comparing the current situation (considering the risks due to the transportation of hazardous materials on the main motorways and main national roads) with a potential scenario that introduces a few mitigating interventions, such as a partial conversion from road haulage to rail transport. This comparison can be accomplished by developing the existing <b>intermodal</b> <b>platforms</b> and implementing new ones in strategic areas...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, the {{relationship}} between Campania (the region of Naples) and the Far East (especially China) are rapidly growing. This region {{is the only one}} in Southern Italy to have three freight villages (<b>Intermodal</b> <b>platforms),</b> localized in three different provinces, two commercial ports and a wide road and rail network. Campania can be considered as the macro-logistic platform of the whole southern Italy on the Mediterranean Sea and it’s a perfect access gateway for the goods on the Asia-Europe route. LOGICA’s (Regional Agency for Logistics and Freight Transport Promotion) main goal is to promote, especially abroad, the whole logistics and transportation regional system moving as a matchmaking subject between the regional, national and international demand and supply of transportation and logistics services. Approximately 15 percent of the world containerized flow of goods transits across the Suez Canal that channels all the traffics, between the Far East and Europe, in a single flow of almost 12, 500, 000 TEUs on the Asia- Europe route and almost 5, 800, 000 TEUs on the Europe- Asia route in the year 2006.

40|$|In {{the last}} years, <b>intermodal</b> {{mobility}} <b>platforms</b> offering combinations of various modal types, like trains, buses, carsharing and ride sharing, have emerged. These platforms often {{also offer a}} smartphone-based door-to-door navigation and a sophisticated travel assistance. Unfortunately, these smartphone-based services cannot {{be used by the}} travelers as soon as they are driving a car themselves, e. g., a carsharing vehicle or their private car, due to road safety regulations. The driver is essentially disconnected from the service. In addition, modern cars have a lot of configuration options a driver might want to set up. This discourages using shared vehicles in an intermodal itinerary. In this work we identify use cases of how an integration of carsharing vehicles into intermodal travel information systems can enhance travel experience, introduce a system architecture to allow the necessary information exchange and present a preliminary prototype to demonstrate its technical feasibility...|$|R

It was investigated how truck drivers use the facilities available in truck sleeper cabins, how they improvise solutions and customize cabin interiors to meet their needs. Main focus was given to activities other than the driving task: rest and sleeping, object storage, feeding, personal care, communication, entertainment. A preliminary field observation {{was carried out in}} an <b>intermodal</b> logistic <b>platform</b> in Cubatão, São Paulo. Three different models of sleeper truck cabins were randomly selected. Participant observation method was used, by applying the following tools: video and photographic registers of cabins’ interiors, objects, improvised solutions and customizations; semi-structured interviews; narratives. The results were submitted to descriptive analysis (identifying patterns in objects, utensils and improvised solutions recorded in images) and theoretical analysis (content analysis and discourse analysis of semi-structured interviews and narratives transcriptions). Results showed that the selected tools for data collection and analysis are adequate for the research, but some adjusts and improvements will be necessary...|$|R
40|$|Cities are {{increasingly}} being challenged by traffic congestion and pollution. Enabling greater use of intermodal travel among inhabitants can be a way for a city to proactively meet these challenges. Currently, however, city planners are faced with an incomplete understanding of 1) what holds inhabitants back from intermodal travelling as well as 2) what could motivate inhabitants to adopt intermodal travel behaviours. Toward answering such questions, this study presents and evaluates research propositions regarding the shifting of city travellers' behaviours to intermodal travel. The extant literature, data from government and industry sources along with extensive qualitative primary data from eight in-depth expert interviews and twelve city traveller interviews are then drawn upon, analysed, and {{discussed in terms of}} policy and implementation considerations. Special attention is given to the role of information as a key contributor to overcoming change resistance and a potential behavioural motivator to engage in intermodal travel. Among the findings is the identified need for collaboration among mobility service providers to reduce perceived mode barriers and provide transparent information. Moreover, policy makers will need to focus on attractive incentives more than coercion mechanisms in order to sustainably motivate intermodal travelling. Tailoring the interventions and communication to different city inhabitant segments will also be the key to policy effectiveness. Overall, the study finds substantial support for the introduction of an online integrated <b>intermodal</b> information <b>platform...</b>|$|R
40|$|Wireless and {{broadband}} {{services are}} increasingly substitutable for and competitive with wireline {{services in the}} markets for basic local telephone service. State commissions are often charged with monitoring competitive conditions in their states and adapting policy to changing conditions. Failure to consider the competitive effect of wireless and broadband services in local telephone markets will bias competitive analyses towards concluding that incumbent wireline providers have more market power than they actually do and lead to more intervention than is necessary to achieve public interest outcomes. Conversely, assuming that the availability of wireless and broadband services automatically makes local telephone markets workably competitive will bias competitive analyses towards concluding that incumbent wireline providers have less market power than they actually do and lead to less intervention than is necessary to achieve public interest outcomes. Assessing competitive conditions in a market and determining whether a firm or group of firms has market power requires defining the market in product and geographic terms, determining which producers and consumers {{are part of the}} market, measuring market shares and/or other indicators of the competitiveness of the market, and making a determination as to whether the market is or is not workably competitive.
