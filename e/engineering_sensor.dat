40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} {{develops a}} concept {{for the design}} and application of intelligent kinetic systems in architecture. Our motivation lies in creating spaces and objects that can physically re-configure themselves to meet changing needs. Intelligent kinetic systems arise from the isomorphic convergence of three key elements: structural <b>engineering,</b> <b>sensor</b> technology and adaptable architecture. At the intersection of these areas exists an unexplored physical architecture tuned to address today’s dynamic, flexible and constantly changing needs.

40|$|Abstract: In {{environmental}} <b>engineering,</b> <b>sensor</b> measurement is {{a process}} undertaken with respect to an environmental domain, i. e. an area of interest, to measure a domain property. Knowledge of a domain, meaning its concepts and relations that hold among them, can be formally represented by means of ontology. Therefore, given an ontology for an environmental domain, {{it seems reasonable to}} suggest that sensor data acquisition can be translated into ontological knowledge acquisition. We demonstrate this translation for the domain of road vehicle classification by measurement of vibration. We show how supervised machine learning is applied to learn a function that maps sensor data to ontological concepts. Hence, we abstract from both the physical sensor layer and the sensor data layer by discarding raw measurement data and retaining the knowledge conveyed by these data. We show how rules can be used to infer new domain knowledge, such as vehicle velocity...|$|E

40|$|The idea of {{building}} the nanoworld from the ‘bottom-up’, as suggested by Richard Feynmann, 1 {{has been a great}} source of inspiration to many scientists. Molecules are excellent building blocks for nanoconstruction due to the rich variety of functionality which can be incorporated by chemical synthesis. By carefully controlling the non-covalent interactions between molecules, nanostructures with interesting and unique architectures can be spontaneously assembled. 2 This combination of chemical synthesis (to yield a molecule) and subsequent self-assembly (to yield a nanofabricated material) is a powerful strategy for the formation of new materials, which are structured at the nanometer length scale, and hence exhibit new forms of behaviour. This talk focuses on the assembly of soft gel-type materials using molecular-scale building blocks. 3 These materials form when molecules assemble into fibre-like ‘solid ’ structures, which can effectively immobilise a liquid phase {{in the form of a}} soft gel.

40|$|We {{describe}} the concept, the fabrication, {{and the most}} relevant properties of a piezoelectric-polymer system: Two fluoroethylenepropylene (FEP) films with good electret properties are laminated around a specifically designed and prepared polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) template at 300 degrees C. After removing the PTFE template, a two-layer FEP film with open tubular channels is obtained. For electric charging, the two-layer FEP system is subjected to a high electric field. The resulting dielectric barrier discharges inside the tubular channels yield a ferroelectret with high piezoelectricity. d(33) coefficients of up to 160 pC/N have already been achieved on the ferroelectret films. After charging at suitable elevated temperatures, the piezoelectricity is stable at temperatures of at least 130 degrees C. Advantages of the transducer films include ease of fabrication at laboratory or industrial scales, {{a wide range of}} possible geometrical and processing parameters, straightforward control of the uniformity of the polymer system, flexibility, and versatility of the soft ferroelectrets, and a large potential for device applications e. g., in the areas of biomedicine, communications, production <b>engineering,</b> <b>sensor</b> systems, environmental monitoring, etc. Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cientifico e Tecnologico (CNPq), Brazil(DAAD) Deutscher Akademischer Austausch Dienst, GermanyUniversity of Potsdam, GermanyDeutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [QI 65 / 1 - 1...|$|E

This dissertation considers beamformer design and direction finding for a broadband source using concentric ring array (CRA) that contains many concentric rings of different radii. The multi-ring structure of a CRA has several advantages including the flexibility in array pattern synthesis and adaptive array design. We first proposed three CRA array pattern synthesis techniques, which can be used to control the side lobe and/or main lobe width of the array pattern of a deterministic broadband beamformer. We then proposed a flexible partially adaptive broadband beamformer design based on element-space approach.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{recognition}} and biofunctionality has attracted increasing {{interest in the}} fields of chemistry and material sciences. Advances in the field of nanotechnology for the synthesis of desired metal oxide nanostructures have provided a solid platform for the integration of nanoelectronic devices. These nanoelectronics-based devices have the ability to recognize molecular species of living organisms, and they have created the possibility for advanced chemical sensing functionalities with low limits of detection in the nanomolar range. In this review, various metal oxides, such as ZnO-, CuO-, and NiO-based nanosensors, are described using different methods (receptors) of functionalization for molecular and ion recognition. These functionalized metal oxide surfaces with a specific receptor involve either a complex formation between the receptor and the analyte or an electrostatic interaction during the chemical sensing of analytes. Metal oxide nanostructures are considered revolutionary nanomaterials that have a specific surface for the immobilization of biomolecules with much needed orientation, good conformation and enhanced biological activity which further improve the sensing properties of nanosensors. Metal oxide nanostructures are associated with certain unique optical, electrical and molecular characteristics in addition to unique functionalities and surface charge features which shows attractive platforms for interfacing biorecognition elements with effective transducing properties for signal amplification.

40|$|This book {{faces the}} {{interdisciplinary}} challenge of formulating performance-assessing design approaches for networked cyber-physical systems (NCPSs). Its novel distributed multilayer cooperative control deals simultaneously with communication-network and control performance {{required for the}} network and application layers of an NCPS respectively. Practically, it distributes the computational burden among different devices, which act cooperatively to achieve NCPS goals. The approach {{can be applied to}} NCPSs based on both wired and wireless technologies and so is suitable for future network infrastructures in which different protocols and technologies coexist. The book reports realistic results from performance evaluation of the new approach, when applied in different operative scenarios. Readers of this book will benefit by: learning a general, technology-independent methodology for the design and implementation of cooperative distributed algorithms for flow control at the network layer of an NCPS that gives algorithm-parameter-tuning guidelines for assessing the desired quality of service performance; learning a general methodology for the design and implementation of consensus-based algorithms at the application layer that allows monitoring and control of distributed physical systems and gives algorithm-parameter-tuning guidelines for assessing the desired control system performance; understanding the main network simulators needed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed multilayer control approach in different realistic network operation scenarios; and practising with a cooperative multilayer control project that assesses acceptable NCPS performance in networked monitoring and robot systems, autonomous and queuing networks, and other critical human relief applications. Researchers, graduate students and practitioners working in automation, <b>engineering,</b> <b>sensor</b> networks, mobile robotics and computer networks will find this book instructive.
