500|$|Due to his non-ideal size as a pitcher, {{some have}} seen issues in Loup's stamina and durability. His pitches can also {{come across as}} [...] "a bit too hittable." [...] He is, however, {{especially}} effective when pitching against left-handed batters. In 2013, Loup was viewed by the Blue Jays' manager John Gibbons as [...] "not necessarily a long guy; he's more a situational, one-inning guy." [...] Despite his shortcomings, Loup has the lowest walk rate among all major league pitchers who have pitched at least seventy innings since 2012, having walked only 2.6% of the batters he has faced.

500|$|Author Brandon Friedman, also {{a combat}} veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, shared a similar view at VetVoice: [...] "The Hurt Locker is a high-tension, well-made, action movie that will {{certainly}} keep most viewers {{on the edges}} of their seats. But if you know anything about the Army, or about operations or life in Iraq, you'll be so distracted by the nonsensical sequences and plot twists that it will ruin the movie for you. It certainly did for me." [...] Friedman criticized the inaccuracy of the film's representation of combat, saying [...] "in real life, EOD techs don't conduct dangerous missions as autonomous three-man teams without communications gear ... Another thing you'll rarely hear in combat is an EOD E-7 suggesting to two or three of his <b>guys</b> <b>that</b> they leave the scene of an explosion in an Iraqi city by saying: 'C'mon, let's split up.

In a subsequent interview with Carrie Fisher, Love said that she was interested in starting a union for recording artists, and also discussed race relations in the music industry, advocating for record companies to [...] "put money back into the black community [...] white people have been stealing from for years."

It refers to that world, and I liked the idea of paralleling the band's experiences {{over the past two years}} with some of the things [...] Ryan [...] is going through in this video." [...] Webb went on to add that the reason Key is sprinting through Los Angeles, once again, is not bad <b>guys</b> <b>that</b> are after him, it is his [...] "own personal demons".

500|$|The two hippies, Seth and Munchie, were {{portrayed by}} comic actors Martin Mull and George Carlin respectively. For a while, the staff {{were not sure}} of who would play Munchie. Although they had decided on Mull to play Seth, the staff were [...] "kind of stuck" [...] on who would play Munchie. Carlin was {{suggested}} by Ron Hauge, one of the Simpsons writers, who [...] "really wanted to meet [...] " [...] but ended up {{not going to the}} recording session. Scully stated that Mull and Carlin were [...] "some of the funniest <b>guys</b> <b>that</b> ever lived", and that recording their lines was [...] "a lot of fun". Although it does not occur with most other guest stars in the series, Mull and Carlin recorded their lines together. While the designs of Seth and Munchie were not modeled after anyone in particular, their hair-styles were slightly based on those of Jerry Greenfield and Ben Cohen, owners of the ice cream company Ben & Jerry's. Comedian Bob Hope was portrayed by series regular cast member Dan Castellaneta, who plays Homer among many other characters in the series. Jill St. John and Phyllis Diller were both voiced by American voice actress Tress MacNeille. The psychedelic version of The Simpsons main theme that plays during the end credits was performed by Yo La Tengo, an American alternative rock band who are friends of Cary's.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} David Robert Jones is {{a reference}} to English musician David Bowie, who was born with that name. [...] "In Which We Meet Mr. Jones" [...] was the first appearance of the character. When actor Jared Harris was first cast for the part, he was told Jones was [...] "possibly a major, important character", {{as indicated by the}} episode's title. Whether his character would make a reappearance later in the season depended on how well received Jones was by the show's audience, Harris' performance, and if the writers felt they had more to tell about the character. [...] Harris later described Jones in a May 2009 interview, [...] "I think you could sense that there was a great bit of ambiguity about the character which was useful. He's a bad guy that might be on the right side. He just might be fighting for the good guys. Those guys are always great parts because you leave the audience guessing about what side he's really on. He's one of those <b>guys</b> <b>that</b> if he's fighting for the right cause, he's a tremendous ally. But if he's fighting on the wrong cause, he's a formidable opponent. He's an anti-hero who is fighting for the just cause". Harris asserted in a February 2009 interview that he did not sign a recurring contract, meaning that the character was not meant to be permanent. He affirmed this by believing the character's personality rendered Jones incapable of joining the regular cast, [...] "You'd have to keep [...] chained like a dog. You couldn't let him loose. You certainly couldn't let him use his hands. You know what the f--k he'd do".|$|E
500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia in April 2009, and lasted for approximately 67 days. Many filming locations were established in Downtown Vancouver and its surroundings. Stage shooting for the film {{took place at the}} Canadian Motion Picture Park studio in Burnaby, an adjacent city that forms part of Metro Vancouver. Kosinski devised and constructed twelve to fifteen of the film's sets, including Kevin Flynn's safe house, a creation he illustrated on a napkin for a visual effects test. [...] "I wanted to build as much as possible. It was important to me that this world feel real, and anytime I could build something I did. So I hired <b>guys</b> <b>that</b> I went to architecture school with to work on the sets for this film, and hopefully people who watch the film feel like there’s a certain physicality to this world that hopefully they appreciate, knowing that real architects actually put this whole thing together." [...] The film was shot in dual camera 3D using Pace Fusion rigs like James Cameron's Avatar, but unlike the Sony F950 cameras on that film, Tron used the F35s. [...] "The benefit of ," [...] according to director Kosinski, [...] "is that it has a full 35mm sensor which gives you that beautiful cinematic shallow depth of field." [...] The film's beginning portions were shot in 2D, while forty minutes of the film were vertically enhanced for IMAX. Digital Domain was contracted to work on the visual effects, while companies such as Prime Focus Group, DD Vancouver, and Mr. X were brought on to collaborate with producer on the post-production junctures of Tron: Legacy.
