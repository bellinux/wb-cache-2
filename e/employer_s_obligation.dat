40|$|The {{obligation}} to provide {{fair and equitable treatment}} to foreign investors and investments has existed {{as a concept}} of international economic law at least since the 1919 Covenant of the League of Nations. The fair and equitable treatment provision is a key protection contained {{in the vast majority of}} modern bilateral investment treaties. Tribunals adjudicating alleged breaches of these fair and equitable treatment provisions have not arrived at a uniform interpretation of the term. As a threshold issue, however each tribunal must address the question of whether a state 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>obligations</b> under a given treaty 2 ̆ 7 s fair and equitable treatment provision will be additive or equal to the state 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> preexisting <b>obligations</b> toward all aliens under the minimum standard required by customary international law. Some tribunals have responded to this question by announcing that the protections afforded under fair and equitable treatment provisions and customary international law have converged such that a state 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>obligations</b> under either standard are coextensive. This Note contends that tribunals adopting the convergence approach overstate the protections afforded to investors under customary international law. By subsuming the {{obligation to}} provide fair and equitable treatment within customary international law, these tribunals also ignore the historical development of fair and equitable treatment as a solely treaty-based obligation that did not bind states as a matter of customary international law...|$|R

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the relationship between}} international and domestic law in deportation proceedings. The argument is made that, generally, Canadian law should be interpreted consistently with Canada 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>obligations</b> at international law, as reflected in conventions and custom. More specifically, the article proposes that Canada 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>obligation</b> at international law to protect {{the family and the}} child be recognized in Canadian law as one of the principles of fundamental justice under section 7 of the Charter. The protection of the family is engaged by the deportation of domiciled aliens because, by definition, these deportees have been in Canada {{for a long period of}} time and have fully assimilated into Canadian society: deportation will, therefore, have an adverse impact on the aliens 2 ̆ 7 family life and their children. Indeed, the adverse effect of deportation on families and children is increasingly recognized, by courts and commentators, as a violation of internationally protected human rights. If the Canadian Charter is interpreted consistently with the growing body of law surrounding these international human rights, a compelling case can be made against the power of the State to deport domiciled aliens from Canada...|$|R

40|$|International {{corruption}} {{law is a}} growing, if understudied, area {{of international}} economic law. This Article examines two aspects of governments 2 ̆ 7 enforcement of the OECD 2 ̆ 7 s Anti-Bribery Convention. The first aspect is the member state 2 ̆ 7 s efforts to enforce its own national legislation prohibiting foreign corruption within its territory and with regards to its nationals doing business abroad. The OECD Treaty 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>obligation</b> concerning member states 2 ̆ 7 enforcement of their own national legislation is somewhat ambiguous. While the obligation to pass particular national legislation is quite clear and specific, the treaty does not specify what resources that a state must dedicate to internally enforcing these laws. As a result, states may have robust anti-corruption {{laws on the books}} but fail to enforce them in a meaningful way. This is more than an abstract concern. As of 2013, {{less than half of the}} states party to the OECD Treaty had successfully prosecuted a private actor for foreign corruption. This Article also discusses a second aspect of enforcement: how these internal enforcement ambiguities hamper state-to-state efforts to enforce the agreement. States cannot easily identify whether other states are breaching the treaty 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>obligations</b> when the internal enforcement obligations are opaque. This complicates international efforts to pressure other states to increase their compliance through retaliation or reciprocity. This Article concludes by discussing enforcement alternatives, namely the continued rigorous American enforcement of anti-corruption policies against private actors, even for activities having minimal territorial ties...|$|R
