40|$|Tokyo) {{has been}} widely used as a dust size {{classifier}} for a low-volume air sampler in Japan. The sampler uses the historical criterion defined by the British Medical Research Council (BMRC). However, a new sampling convention based on the ISO 7708 respirable dust convention was recently introduced into the Japanese standard for work environment measurement. It is necessary to modify the multi-channel static <b>horizontal</b> <b>elutriator</b> to satisfy the ISO 7708 respirable convention. We propose a modification of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>elutriator,</b> involving the shortening of 11 of the 36 plates to meet the ISO 7708 respirable convention. The relationship between aerosol particle size and penetration for the elutriator was measured in calm air. The measured penetrations were compared with the calculated performance of the sampler and with the sampling convention for the ISO respirable dust. The calculated bias of sampledmasses {{with respect to the}} ISO respirable mass was almost zero for the workplace aerosols...|$|E
40|$|Abstractâ€”Correlations between respirable mass by {{both the}} 4 -channel and the 8 -channel MRE <b>horizontal</b> <b>elutriators</b> and respirable surface area by {{diffraction}} size-frequency analyser have been determined. The relationships {{were found to be}} first order over a wide range of dust levels for coal and for mineral dusts of varying free silica content. These correlations facilitate the use of respirable surface area determined by diffraction size-frequency analysis as a direct measure-ment of dust hazard. By using the correlations and any reputable respirable mass formula, a specific maximum respirable surface area for a dust cloud of known free silica can be formulated. The application of surface area measurements to a practical investigation of dust hazards is briefly discussed. TNTRODUCTION FOLLOWING the First Australian Pneumoconiosis Conference in Sydney in 1968, a re-evaluation of the existing departmental dust standards was initiated. This laboratory commenced an examination of the various dust measurement parameters and th...|$|R

The location of deposition of aerosol particles within the respiratory system strongly determines {{the health effects of}} exposure to such aerosols. This phenomenon led people to invent aerosol samplers that select a subset of the aerosol particles that reach certain parts of the respiratory system. Examples of these subsets of the particle-size distribution of an aerosol, important in occupational health, include the inhalable, thoracic, and respirable fractions. The fraction that can enter each part of the respiratory system depends on the deposition of particles in the upper parts of the airway. The inhalable fraction of particles, defined as the proportion of particles originally in the air that can enter the nose or mouth, depends on external wind speed and direction and on the particle-size distribution by aerodynamic diameter. The thoracic fraction is the proportion of the particles in ambient aerosol that can reach the thorax or chest region. The respirable fraction is the proportion of particles in the air that can reach the alveolar region. To measure the respirable fraction of particles in air, a pre-collector is used with a sampling filter. The pre-collector excludes particles as the airways remove particles from inhaled air. The sampling filter collects the particles for measurement. It is common to use cyclonic separation for the pre-collector, but other techniques include impactors, <b>horizontal</b> <b>elutriators,</b> and large pore membrane filters.|$|R
