5|$|After abandoning Kriya yoga, Salinger tried Dianetics (the {{forerunner of}} Scientology), even meeting its founder L.

This was followed by an adherence {{to a number of}} spiritual, medical, and nutritional belief systems including an interest in Christian Science, Edgar Cayce, <b>homeopathy,</b> acupuncture, and macrobiotics.|$|E
5|$|By 1952, Kulikovsky {{had shrunk}} more than 4inches (10cm) from his peak height of 6ft 2inches (188cm). He distrusted {{conventional}} medicine and tried <b>homeopathy</b> instead. By 1958, he was virtually paralyzed, and had difficulty sleeping. At {{the end of}} his life he was sleeping on the sofa in the living room of the couple's Cooksville house, to avoid waking his wife. He died there on the night of 11 August 1958. His estate was valued at 12,123.47Canadian dollars, about 98,000Canadian dollars as of 2012. The Grand Duchess died two years later, and was interred next to her husband in York Cemetery, Toronto.|$|E
5|$|He {{drew from}} his medical {{training}} to discredit popular ideas about {{differences among the}} races. In 1843 he gave a lecture series, Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Races, to demonstrate the failings of phrenology, which was a so-called scientific practice {{of the time that}} was applied in a way to draw racist conclusions and attribute negative characteristics to ethnic Africans. He rejected the practice of <b>homeopathy,</b> an alternative to the scientific medicine being taught in universities. Although he had a successful medical career, he was not admitted to the American Medical Association or local associations because of racial discrimination.|$|E
5|$|The magical {{and mystical}} {{side of the}} herbal also lives on. Herbals often {{explained}} plant lore, displaying a superstitious or spiritual side. There was, for example, the fanciful doctrine of signatures, the belief that there were similarities in {{the appearance of the}} part of the body affected the appearance of the plant {{to be used as a}} remedy. The astrology of Culpeper can be seen in contemporary anthroposophy (biodynamic gardening) and alternative medical approaches like <b>homeopathy,</b> aromatherapy and other new age medicine show connections with herbals and traditional medicine.|$|E
5|$|Hanegraaff {{identified}} the second main healing current in the New Age movement as being holistic health. This {{emerged in the}} 1970s out of the free clinic movement of the 1960s, and has various connections with the Human Potential Movement. It emphasises {{the idea that the}} human individual is a holistic, interdependent relationship between mind, body, and spirit, and that healing is a process in which an individual becomes whole by integrating with the powers of the universe. A very wide array of methods are utilised within the holistic health movement, {{with some of the most}} common including acupuncture, reiki, biofeedback, chiropractic, yoga, kinesiology, <b>homeopathy,</b> aromatherapy iridology, massage and other forms of bodywork, meditation and visualisation, nutritional therapy, psychic healing, herbal medicine, healing using crystals, metals, music, chromotherapy, and reincarnation therapy. The use of crystal healing has become a particularly prominent visual trope within the New Age; this practice was not common in esotericism prior to their adoption in the New Age milieu.|$|E
5|$|Days {{would be}} {{structured}} so that activities would be planned throughout, with occupational therapy carrying on into evenings and at weekends. A typical day would include breakfast then flower arranging until 10:30, {{followed by an}} hour in the occupation room for therapy. After their work, the patients would go for a walk or join in community singing until 2pm. Between 2pm and 8pm there would be more time in the occupation room, a period of rest and time in the garden. At 8 pm there would be community games and country dancing. Casson believed it was important to keep the therapy room separate {{from the rest of the}} department, as it was specialised knowledge. She also insisted that certain activities, such as knitting, were not used as it was not sufficient distraction from the patient's fantasy system. Some concern existed that patients would not accept being put to work, but of her 100 patients in 1931, only six refused the therapy. A member (and later fellow) of the British <b>Homeopathy</b> Society, Casson also included homeopathic treatments in her programme for the patients.|$|E

25|$|The use of <b>homeopathy</b> as a {{preventive}} for serious infectious diseases is especially controversial, {{in the context}} of ill-founded public alarm over the safety of vaccines stoked by the anti-vaccination movement. Promotion of homeopathic alternatives to vaccines has been characterized as dangerous, inappropriate and irresponsible. In December 2014, Australian <b>homeopathy</b> supplier <b>Homeopathy</b> Plus! were found to have acted deceptively in promoting homeopathic alternatives to vaccines.|$|E
25|$|The Indian {{government}} recognizes <b>homeopathy</b> {{as one of}} {{its national}} systems of medicine; it has established AYUSH or the Department of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. The south Indian state of Kerala also has a cabinet-level AYUSH department. The Central Council of Homoeopathy was established in 1973 to monitor higher education in <b>homeopathy,</b> and National Institute of Homoeopathy in 1975. A minimum of a recognized diploma in <b>homeopathy</b> and registration on a state register or the Central Register of Homoeopathy is required to practise <b>homeopathy</b> in India.|$|E
25|$|People who are {{considering}} whether to use <b>homeopathy</b> should first get advice from a registered health practitioner. Those who use <b>homeopathy</b> should tell their health practitioner and should keep taking any prescribed treatments.|$|E
25|$|In June 2016, blogger and sceptic Jithin Mohandas {{launched}} a petition through Change.org asking {{the government of}} Kerala, India, to stop admitting students to <b>homeopathy</b> medical colleges. Mohandas said that government approval of these colleges makes them appear legitimate, leading thousands of talented students to join them and end up with invalid degrees. The petition asks that <b>homeopathy</b> colleges be converted to regular medical colleges and that people with <b>homeopathy</b> degrees be provided with training in scientific medicine.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{reliable}} evidence that <b>homeopathy</b> is effective for treating health conditions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Homeopathy</b> is {{a system}} of {{alternative}} medicine created in 1796 by Samuel Hahnemann, based on his doctrine of like cures like (similia similibus curentur), a claim that a substance that causes the symptoms of a disease in healthy people would cure similar symptoms in sick people. <b>Homeopathy</b> is a pseudoscience – a belief that is incorrectly presented as scientific. Homeopathic preparations are not effective for treating any condition; large-scale studies have found <b>homeopathy</b> {{to be no more}} effective than a placebo, indicating that any positive effects that follow treatment are only due to the placebo effect, normal recovery from illness, or regression toward the mean.|$|E

25|$|Some homeopathic {{treatment}} {{is covered by}} {{the public health service}} of several European countries, including France, the United Kingdom and Luxembourg. In other countries, such as Belgium, <b>homeopathy</b> is not covered. In Austria, the public health service requires scientific proof of effectiveness in order to reimburse medical treatments and <b>homeopathy</b> is listed as not reimbursable, but exceptions can be made; private health insurance policies sometimes include homeopathic treatment. The Swiss government, after a 5-year trial, withdrew coverage of <b>homeopathy</b> and four other complementary treatments in 2005, stating that they did not meet efficacy and cost-effectiveness criteria, but following a referendum in 2009 the five therapies have been reinstated for a further 6-year trial period from 2012.|$|E

25|$|Hahnemann's miasm theory remains disputed and {{controversial}} within <b>homeopathy</b> even in modern times. The theory of miasms {{has been criticized}} as an explanation developed by Hahnemann to preserve the system of <b>homeopathy</b> {{in the face of}} treatment failures, and for being inadequate to cover the many hundreds of sorts of diseases, as well as for failing to explain disease predispositions, as well as genetics, environmental factors, and the unique disease history of each patient.|$|E
25|$|One {{reason for}} the growing {{popularity}} of <b>homeopathy</b> was its apparent success in treating people suffering from infectious disease epidemics.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{who choose}} to use <b>homeopathy</b> rather than {{evidence-based}} medicine risk missing timely diagnosis and effective treatment of serious conditions such as cancer.|$|E
25|$|<b>Homeopathy</b> {{is not a}} {{plausible}} system of treatment, as its dogmas about how drugs, illness, the human body, liquids and solutions operate are contradicted by {{a wide range of}} discoveries across biology, psychology, physics and chemistry made in the two centuries since its invention. Although some clinical trials produce positive results, multiple systematic reviews have indicated that this is because of chance, flawed research methods, and reporting bias. Continued homeopathic practice, despite the evidence that it does not work, has been criticized as unethical because it discourages the use of effective treatments, with the World Health Organization warning against using <b>homeopathy</b> to try to treat severe diseases such as HIV and malaria. The continued practice of <b>homeopathy,</b> despite a lack of evidence of efficacy, has led to it being characterized within the scientific and medical communities as nonsense, quackery, and a sham.|$|E
25|$|Canadian {{clinical}} practice guidelines state {{that there is}} insufficient evidence to recommend in favor of or against using herbal medicine, dietary supplements or <b>homeopathy</b> against obesity.|$|E
25|$|People {{who choose}} <b>homeopathy</b> may put their health at risk if they reject or delay {{treatments}} {{for which there}} is good evidence for safety and effectiveness.|$|E
25|$|<b>Homeopathy</b> {{is fairly}} common in some {{countries}} while being uncommon in others; is highly regulated {{in some countries}} and mostly unregulated in others. It is practised worldwide and professional qualifications and licences are needed in most countries. In some countries, there are no specific legal regulations concerning the use of <b>homeopathy,</b> while in others, licences or degrees in conventional medicine from accredited universities are required. In Germany, to become a homeopathic physician, one must attend a three-year training programme, while France, Austria and Denmark mandate licences to diagnose any illness or dispense of any product whose purpose is to treat any illness.|$|E
25|$|Practitioners of <b>homeopathy</b> {{hold that}} higher dilutions―described as being of higher potency―produce {{stronger}} medicinal effects. This idea is also inconsistent with observed dose-response relationships, where effects {{are dependent on}} the concentration of the active ingredient in the body. This dose-response relationship has been confirmed in myriad experiments on organisms as diverse as nematodes, rats, and humans. Some homeopaths contend that the phenomenon of hormesis may {{support the idea of}} dilution increasing potency, but the dose-response relationship outside the zone of hormesis declines with dilution as normal, and nonlinear pharmacological effects do not provide any credible support for <b>homeopathy.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Homeopathy</b> {{achieved}} {{its greatest}} {{popularity in the}} 19th century. It {{was introduced to the}} United States in 1825 by Hans Birch Gram, a student of Hahnemann. The first homeopathic school in the US opened in 1835, and in 1844, the first US national medical association, the American Institute of <b>Homeopathy,</b> was established. Throughout the 19th century, dozens of homeopathic institutions appeared in Europe and the United States, and by 1900, there were 22 homeopathic colleges and 15,000 practitioners in the United States. Because medical practice of the time relied on ineffective and often dangerous treatments, patients of homeopaths often had better outcomes than those of the doctors of the time. Homeopathic preparations, even if ineffective, would almost surely cause no harm, making the users of homeopathic preparations less likely to be killed by the treatment {{that was supposed to be}} helping them. The relative success of <b>homeopathy</b> in the 19th century may have led to the abandonment of the ineffective and harmful treatments of bloodletting and purging and to have begun the move towards more effective, science-based medicine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Homeopathy</b> is {{singled out}} {{as an example of}} a {{mainstream}} alternative medicine that has public support and taxpayer funding through the National Health Service. Dawkins explains that the rationale behind it is unfounded and demonstrates that the magnitude of dilution required is so great the patient is practically imbibing pure water. This is illustrated by the typical homeopathic dilution of 30C (1:10030, that is thirty steps of dilution by 1% each time), which requires a drop of active ingredient dissolved in a body of water greater than the whole ocean. Dawkins cites a 2005 meta-analysis by The Lancet that concludes that <b>homeopathy</b> has no consistently demonstrable effect on health.|$|E
25|$|Earl Lawrence Mindell is a Canadian-American {{writer and}} {{nutritionist}} {{who is a}} strong advocate of nutrition as preventive medicine and <b>homeopathy.</b> Mindell left his role at FreeLife following a number of inaccurate statements regarding Goji (also known as wolfberry) juice.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposed}} {{mechanisms for}} <b>homeopathy</b> are precluded from having any effect {{by the laws}} of physics and physical chemistry. The extreme dilutions used in homeopathic preparations usually leave not one molecule of the original substance in the final product.|$|E
