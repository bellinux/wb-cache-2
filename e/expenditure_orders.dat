40|$|The large {{deflection}} resistance (to nearly 30 times the elastic limit deflection) of model frames subjected to dynamically applied lateral loads is studied {{as a function}} of deflection and time. Static and dynamic tests were made to provide a basis for the comparison of the dynamic with the static resistance. Theoretical resistance functions were estimated and found to be in good agreement with the resistance functions determined from the observed experimental data.

40|$|Abstract R&D {{treatment}} {{could be}} influenced by earnings management purposes due to the flexibility allowed in the R&D accounting standards. This paper attempts to determine whether discretionary R&D treatments are motivated by financial performance or can be constrained by board independence. The study is conducted on a sample of 410 firm-year French companies investing heavily in R&D in the period 2007 - 2011 and accounting data are collected from the Worldscope database. Using two logistic regression models, {{results show that the}} French companies do not tend to capitalize the R&D <b>expenditures</b> in <b>order</b> to smoothen the results but rather tend to cut the R&D <b>expenditures</b> in <b>order</b> to achieve earnings targets. However, the hypothesis that independent directors reduce R&D manipulation is not supported. Key words Earnings management, R&D capitalization, R&D cut, board independenc...|$|R
25|$|Based upon {{experience}} with the XF5F-1 and the XP-50, Grumman had begun work on a more advanced fighter, designated model G-51. Thus, the USAAC decided to replace the XP-50 with the newer design and recommended procurement of two G-51s, designated XP-65, using the original XP-50 <b>expenditure</b> <b>order</b> to cover the development. Consideration was given to combining the Air Corps and Navy requirements into a common design, but the weight and performance penalties inherent in conflicting requirements were considered great enough that separate designs would be needed. Since the U.S. Navy considered Grumman one of its major production sources and that producing two different model aircraft by Grumman would impede manufacture of aircraft types the U.S. Navy needed, {{it was decided that}} development of the XF7F-1 would continue, and the XP-65 as a parallel development was abandoned.|$|R

50|$|Fiscal {{illusion}} {{has been}} used to explain the flypaper effect often seen when a higher level of government provides a grant to a lower level of government. Here, instead of reducing taxes in order to pass on the benefits of the grant to local taxpayers, the grant-receiving body increases <b>expenditures</b> in <b>order</b> to expand local services in some way. Fiscal illusion is invoked as an explanation because the local taxpayers are not fully aware of the grant as a source of the local government's revenue.|$|R

30|$|In Estonia, liberal market economy, {{relatively}} small public sector, and {{a relatively low}} tax burden result in scarce resources for policy options. Attempts to achieve annually balanced state budget has a pro-cyclical nature, which means that it works well during economic boom, exaggerating growth through growing public expenditures. The opposite took place during recession when government tried to cut <b>expenditures</b> in <b>order</b> to keep budget deficit under control. As taxes were relatively low, government also missed sufficient automatic stabilisers. In general {{we can say that}} government had limited fiscal tools to smooth cyclical fluctuations.|$|R

We mainly results the scale effect using panel data on Japanese municipalities and found that municipalities achieved reductions in their total expenditures with mergers.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between public capital expenditure and public debt in the European Union (EU) on a panel of fifteen countries in 1980 - 2013. We find robust evidence of a negative cointegrating relation, whereby increases in the capital expenditure-GDP ratio cause reductions in the long-run debt-GDP ratio. Our empirical results suggest that current EU fiscal austerity can trigger upward debt spirals if cuts in total expenditure disregard its composition. The findings appear to give support to the view, consistent with the “golden rule of public finance”, that EU fiscal rules should allow for higher levels of capital <b>expenditure</b> in <b>order</b> to foster debt consolidation through growth dividends...|$|R

By highlighting what it costs to ensure longer-term operational capability, NFP organisations will contribute to the discharge of their financial accountability and play a part in educating all stakeholders about the dangers of relying on a single metric. ...|$|R
