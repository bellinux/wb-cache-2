40|$|Reconstruction of 3 D {{structures}} from uncalibrated image sequences has {{a wealthy}} history. Most {{work has been}} focused on rigid objects or static scenes. This paper studies the problem of perspective reconstruction of <b>deformable</b> <b>structures</b> such as dynamic scenes from an uncalibrated image sequence. The task requires decomposing the image measurements into a composition of three factors: 3 D <b>deformable</b> <b>structures,</b> rigid rotations and translations, and intrinsic camera parameters. We develop a factorization algorithm that consists of two steps. In the first step we recover the projective depths iteratively using the sub-space constraints embedded in the image measurements of the <b>deformable</b> <b>structures.</b> In the second step, we scale the image measurements by the reconstructed projective depths. We then extend the linear closed-form solution for weakperspective reconstruction [23] to factorize the scaled measurements and simultaneously reconstruct the deformable shapes and underlying shape model, the rigid motions, and the varying camera parameters such as focal lengths. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed method is demonstrated quantitatively on synthetic data and qualitatively on real image sequences. 1...|$|R

50|$|RT3 has a {{long history}} - a 1979 ground effect Formula Three car which was {{enhanced}} every year until 1984, becoming the dominant car in the formula. Ayrton Senna won the 1983 British Formula Three Championship driving an RT3. RT30 was introduced for the flat-bottom rules coming into effect in 1985. This was notable mainly for being very asymmetric - it had only one sidepod containing a radiator, and a <b>deformable</b> <b>structure</b> panel on the other side. The RT30 was, like many Ralts, developed over several seasons, evolving by the 1985-6 seasons into a highly competitive car, although some teams converted their old RT30s into flat-bottom cars and enjoyed a measure of success with these.|$|E

By transforming this 'slew-driven' elastic dynamics into a bilinear form, an operator spline can be constructed, that gives a low order estimate of the induced disturbance.

40|$|Level-sets provide {{powerful}} {{methods for}} the segmentation of <b>deformable</b> <b>structures.</b> They {{are able to}} handle protrusions and specific topological effects. In this work a particle system formulation of level-sets is introduced. It keeps all {{the advantages of the}} levelset approach for the segmentation of <b>deformable</b> <b>structures,</b> while it overcomes some of its drawbacks. In this approach the level-sets are controlled by particles, which is of particular interest for interactive control.

The use of skeleton techniques provide a reliable intialization of the particles, and it is coherent with simple affine motion.

40|$|International audienceThis work {{presents}} {{image processing}} tools {{that can be}} helpful in the modeling of <b>deformable</b> <b>structures</b> encountered in oceanography. This paper tackles the problem of modeling and tracking <b>deformable</b> <b>structures</b> in remotely sensed image sequences. To take into account deformation (small and large), the authors focus on level-set methods, as they permit the accurate modelling of <b>deformable</b> <b>structures.</b> They can also easily take into account topological changes. The classical level-set formulation is modified by incorporating a particle system aimed at controlling the level-sets. Different kinds of internal energies can be superimposed on the particle system to accurately represent different physical behaviours of the level-set. According to image processing methodology, one tries to derive an external force field coming directly from the image data, mostly from local extrema of the gradient norm. This data is used to provide an external force field acting upon the particle system, and the level set is attracted toward the boundary of a structure. The external energy incorporates a specific "collar" energy used to minimize the number of undesirable features coming from the computation of the gradient's local extrema. A suitable initialization is performed using the skeleton of the distance map. Experimentation shows that such an initialization is stable w. r. t. simple affine motion. One of the advantages of this particle system formulation is that no partial differential equation is solved, and the minimization just requires the use of a classical gradient descent...|$|R
40|$|Single {{crystalline}} silicon {{is often}} used as a base material for micro electromechanical systems (MEMS). A disadvantage from a mechanical {{point of view is}} its anisotropic mechanical behavior. A suspension with <b>deformable</b> <b>structures</b> in different crystallographic orientations therefore leads to an unfavorable anisotropic mechanical behavior of the device. To create an isotropic suspension stiffness, the design is limited to <b>deformable</b> <b>structures</b> in equivalent crystallographic orientations, which limits the design possibilities. This paper presents a method to compensate for the anisotropic mechanical properties of silicon by adjusting the dimensions of the mechanical suspension. The method is investigated by the example of a 3 D tactile sensor, developed at the Eindhoven University of Technology. Using experimental results and Finite Element Analysis it is shown that an isotropic stiffness can be obtained. As a result, the measurement range and uncertainty of the sensor within this range are improved by a factor of 4.

40|$|The {{discrete}} element method (DEM) {{is particularly}} {{suited for the}} numerical simulation of granular soils interacting with various types of <b>deformable</b> <b>structures</b> and inclusions. Numerous studies have been dedicated to the accurate modelling of particle shape, {{yet there is a}} lack of a general framework for modelling <b>deformable</b> <b>structures</b> of arbitrary shapes such as textiles, grids, membranes, tubes and containers. This paper presents a novel generalised approach to this problem in three dimensions. Minkowski sums of polytopes and spheres are used to describe the topology via three simple primitives: spheres, cylinders and thick facets. The cylinders and facets are deformable and can be connected to form grids and other membrane-like structures. A conventional elastic-plastic contact model is adapted to reflect all possible interactions. The implementation is verified by considering spheres moving along a complex membrane structure and a buckling tube. In addition, simulated pull-out tests on a grid and a membrane and bouncing tests of a hollow deformable sphere are reported. The versatility and capabilities of the approach and the potential applications to soil-inclusion problems are demonstrated...|$|R
