5|$|The lens {{features}} a hypersonic zoom motor for its autofocus, {{which is considered}} to be a fast and quiet design. In addition, manual override is allowed in the single-shot autofocus mode. The lens, which focuses internally, has one of the lowest maximum magnification measurements in its class (which includes the Canon 10–18mm and 10–22mm, Sigma 10–20mm f/3.5 and Sigma 10–20mm f/4–5.6 EX DC HSM, Tamron 10–24mm f/3.5–4.5 DI II, Nikon 10–24mm f/3.5–4.5G ED AF-S DX, and Tokina 11–16mm f/2.8 AT-X Pro DX lenses). The lens' autofocus feature is not functional with Pentax ist* series and K100D DSLR cameras that do not support hypersonic zoom mechanics. The lens is capable of focusing from infinity to minimum focusing distance and back in under a second: so micro focusing is rapid. However, because of the narrow <b>focus</b> <b>range</b> (0.13x) the lens is not suitable for macro photography.|$|E
25|$|In optics, {{particularly}} {{as it relates}} to film and photography, depth of field (DOF), also called <b>focus</b> <b>range</b> or effective <b>focus</b> <b>range,</b> is the distance between the nearest and farthest objects in a scene that appear acceptably sharp in an image. Although a lens can precisely focus at only one distance at a time, the decrease in sharpness is gradual {{on each side of the}} focused distance, so that within the DOF, the unsharpness is imperceptible under normal viewing conditions.|$|E

5000|$|Focusing {{distance}} range limiter switch: This switch {{is found}} on most longer focal length lenses, and macro lenses. It {{is used for}} limiting the focusing distance range of the lens when using it in autofocus mode. Most lenses have two settings; these are usually full <b>focus</b> <b>range</b> (from minimum focus distance to infinity), and distant <b>focus</b> <b>range</b> (from halfway point of <b>focus</b> <b>range</b> to infinity). Other lenses have three settings, with the additional setting usually being near <b>focus</b> <b>range</b> (from minimum focus distance to halfway point of <b>focus</b> <b>range).</b> Longer focal length lenses and macro lenses have a relatively long travel distance for the focusing mechanism inside the lens; this feature shortens the autofocus time. When the photographer knows they will not need a certain part of the focus distance range, limiting it will help shorten the autofocus time, and possibly prevent [...] "focus hunting".|$|E

50|$|Compared to a CD's 1.2 mm {{layer of}} polycarbonate, a DVD's laser beam {{only has to}} {{penetrate}} 0.6 mm {{in order to reach}} the recording surface. This allows a DVD drive to focus the beam on a smaller spot size and to read smaller pits. DVD lens supports a different focus for CD or DVD media with same laser. With the newer Blu-ray disc drives, the laser only has to penetrate 0.1 mm of material. Thus the optical assembly would normally have to have an even greater <b>focus</b> <b>range.</b> In practice, the Blu-ray optical system is separate from the DVD/CD system.|$|E
50|$|On {{bodies with}} a flange focal {{distance}} {{greater than that}} of M42, most notably Nikon, three options are available. A simple mechanical adaptor allows the lens to be mounted, but the effect is similar to the introduction of an extension tube, reducing the minimum focus distance at the expense of losing infinity focus. Alternatively, an adaptor with an optical element can be used to retain the original <b>focus</b> <b>range</b> of the lens, at the expense of some image quality. Finally, it is possible to replace the M42 mount on some lenses with the desired camera mount, or to perform the reverse change on a camera body.|$|E

50|$|Due to the {{simplicity}} of the M42 lens mount and the large selection of lenses, M42 adaptors exist for all current and many obsolete lens mounts. The adaptor fits between the camera and the lens, making it possible to mate an M42 lens to a body with a different lens mount. M42 adaptors work best on bodies with a flange depth {{less than or equal to}} the M42's flange depth, which includes the popular Canon EF-mount, the Pentax K-mount, the Minolta/Konica Minolta/Sony A-mount, the Sony E-mount, the Samsung NX-mount, the Fujifilm X-mount and the Four Thirds System including the Micro Four Thirds system. This allows the lens to be physically mounted the correct distance from the film or sensor, retaining the original <b>focus</b> <b>range</b> of the lens without the use of correction optics.|$|E
