30|$|These {{estimates}} {{suggest that}} the low educated who experience early non-employment {{at the start of}} the career are still significantly penalised in terms of hours worked and earnings 6 years after graduation. The results on hours worked are not directly comparable but consistent with the existing literature, which reports persistent effects of early unemployment on later unemployment. However, our results are somewhat larger. For British low educated youth, Gregg (2001) finds that a 3 -months increase in the unemployment duration before age 23 significantly increases the time out of work between age 28 and 33 by 2 months. Schmillen and Umkehrer (2013) obtain larger effects based on new graduates from the German apprenticeship programme: one additional <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> during the first 8 years after graduation increases unemployment in the following 16 years by 0.96 days—almost a one to one change. The larger scar estimated for Belgium may be explained by the Belgian institutional setting, which leads to high labour market rigidities, as argued in Section 2.|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies have}} found that the exit rate from {{unemployment}} increases {{in the vicinity of the}} exhaustion <b>day</b> <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> insurance benefits. The extent to which this "spike" is driven by job search behavior is important for assessing the distortionary effect of unemployment insurance. Card, Chetty and Weber (American Economic Review 2007; 97 : 113 - 118) find a large spike in the exit rate from registered unemployment but only a very small spike in the job finding rate in Austria. We replicate their analysis using matched register data for Finland. We find a large spike also in the job finding rate at the time of benefit exhaustion, even though it is clearly smaller than the spike in the exit rate from unemployment benefits. In addition, we demonstrate difficulties in measuring the time to benefit exhaustion when the benefit entitlement can elapse at a reduced rate during activation measures or part-time working. Unless the remaining benefit entitlement is directly observed in the data, the resulting measurement error can lead to downward biased estimates of the spikes at benefit exhaustion...|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} register-based {{longitudinal}} {{study was to explore}} the relationship between exposure to unemployment and sick leave at a young age and later health and work related outcomes. A comparison was also made between immigrants and native Swedes. The study population consisted of all immigrants, born between 1968 and 1972, and a random sample of native Swedes in the same age range. The follow-up period was 15 years, divided into three 5 -year periods. Unemployment in 1992 was associated with later ≥ 60 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> sickness absence, disability pension and, for all subjects except native Swedish women, also mortality during follow-up. The risk of future sickness absence was about the same in all three follow-up periods. There was an increased risk <b>of</b> ≥ 100 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> in all three follow-up periods, but the risk declined, however, until the last follow-up period. Higher level of education at baseline as well as education attained between 1993 and 1997 decreased the risk <b>of</b> future <b>unemployment.</b> Participating in active labour market programmes was associated with higher risk <b>of</b> future <b>unemployment.</b> The risk <b>of</b> both future <b>unemployment</b> and future sickness absence increased with the length <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> in 1992. Immigrants had a higher risk <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> both at baseline and at follow-up compared with native Swedes, but matched the pattern of native Swedes during follow-up. Exposure to ≥ 60 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> sickness absence in 1993 was associated with increased risk for ≥ 60 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> sickness absence, ≥ 100 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>unemployment,</b> disability pension and mortality during follow-up compared with no sick leave at baseline. The income from work, during the follow-up period, among individuals with spells of sick leave ≥ 60 days in 1993 was around two-thirds of that of individuals not on > 60 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> sick leave. There was a rapid increase in future work absence for the first 1 – 7 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> sick leave claimed. Thereafter there was a lower, but steady increase in <b>days</b> <b>of</b> future work absence for every increase in sick leave.

40|$|This paper evaluates {{a measure}} {{targeted}} at unemployed individuals aged 20 - 24. The {{main purpose of}} the measure is to prevent long-term unemployment by guaranteeing an assignment to some labor market program within 100 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>unemployment.</b> Municipalities voluntarily agree to offer the guarantee. To identify {{the effect of the}} measure, we use three conditions: The guarantee covers individuals aged 24 but not 25, one fifth of the municipalities does not provide the guarantee, and the guarantee existed in 1998 but not in 1997.

40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Great Recession, the Spanish government reduced the replacement rate (RR) from 60 % to 50 % after 180 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> for all spells beginning on July 15, 2012. Using Social Security data and a Differences-in-Differences approach, we find that reducing the RR by 10 percentage points (or 17 %) increases workers' odds of finding a job by at least 41 % relative to similar workers not affected by the reform. To put it differently, the reform reduced the mean expected unemployment duration by 5. 7 weeks (or 14 %), implying an elasticity of 0. 86. We find strong behavioral effects as the reform reduced the expected unemployment duration right from the beginning <b>of</b> the <b>unemployment</b> spell. While the reform had no effect on wages, it did not decrease other measures of post-displacement job-match quality. After 15 months, the reform decreased unemployment insurance expenditures by 16 %, about half of which are explained by job seekers' behavioral changes...|$|R
30|$|Due to {{institutional}} changes {{the introduction of}} the new start-up subsidy was associated with two main concerns: First, the GZ was expected to restrict access to financial support to a smaller range of unemployed individuals than initially supported by the two former programs. Second, to be eligible to GZ individuals have to have at least 90 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> benefit entitlement still available at time of entering the program. As the benefit entitlement is reduced by the days spent in the program, the new eligibility criterion might encourage individuals to exhaust their unemployment benefit entitlement until the required minimum <b>of</b> 90 <b>days</b> is left before entering the program. Such a behavior would decrease the efficiency of the program. This paper aims at determining the empirical relevance of both expectations and showing first evidence on business survival and potential deadweight losses.|$|R

5000|$|Today, the Swedish {{unemployment}} insurance system {{is made up}} of basic insurance and voluntary income-related insurance. The basic insurance is granted to everyone who meet the basic and work requirements: 320 SEK per day are granted to anyone over 20 years who is enrolled at the employment office and is carrying out a job-seeking plan. The voluntary income-related insurance requires the workers to join one of the 36 independent unemployment funds. To become one of the 3.4 million members (2013) <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> funds a worker must have been employed for at least a month. After one year of uninterrupted membership <b>of</b> an <b>unemployment</b> fund and six months of half-time work, the worker is entitled to receive an earning-related daily allowance up to 80% of his or her normal income (with a maximum of 680 SEK per day). The normal income is the average income during the last 12 months, including <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>unemployment.</b> This goes for the first 200 days, after which the rate decreases to 70% until the 300th day, and 70% from day 301-450 (only available for parents to {{children under the age of}} 18).

40|$|It is a known fact that, {{seen in the}} {{short-term}} and medium-term, unemployment is distributed very unevenly among the workers and {{only a minority of}} the workers is affected by it. Around half of the volume <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> in Germany has for some time been concentrated on the 10 % of the unemployed (outflow cohorts) with the longest periods <b>of</b> <b>unemployment.</b> So far, however, it is not known how unemployment is distributed when entire employment histories of age cohorts are examined in the long-term.

In this paper first results are presented from an evaluation, geared to this question, of employment history data from the 'supplementary sample I' of the IAB employment sample. Men born in the period 1925 - 1930 with a virtually uninterrupted employment history in employment subject to social security in the period under observation between 1955 and 1995 were selected as the group of persons to be surveyed.

40|$|Youth {{unemployment}} {{is an increasing}} burden on societies around the world. This prospective, register-based cohort study {{examined the relationship between}} unemployment and sickness absence, disability pension, death and future unemployment among youth in Sweden. A comparison was also made between immigrants and native Swedes. Another aim was to see if Active Labour Market Programs (ALMPs) and attained education moderated the outcomes. The baseline year was 1992, a year of severe economic downturn. The follow-up period was from 1993 to 2007, divided into three 5 -year periods. The study group of 199, 623 individuals comprised all immigrants born between 1968 and 1972 who immigrated before 1990 (25, 607) and a random sample of native Swedes in the same age range (174, 016). Individuals with unemployment benefit in 1990 - 1991, disability pension in 1990 - 1992 or severe disorders leading to hospitalization in 1990 - 1992 were excluded in order to minimize selection bias. Those who were unemployed in 1992 had elevated risk, measured as odds ratios, <b>of</b> ≥ 60 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> sickness absence, disability pension, ≥ 100 <b>days</b> <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> and all, except native Swedish women, had elevated risk of death during follow-up. The risk <b>of</b> future <b>unemployment</b> declined until the last follow-up period, while the elevated risk of future sickness absence was about the same in all three follow-up periods. Higher level of education at baseline decreased the risk <b>of</b> future <b>unemployment.</b> Individuals participating in ALMPs had an increased risk <b>of</b> future <b>unemployment,</b> and immigrant women had an increased risk of sickness absence, compared to non-participating individuals. Attained education between 1993 and 1997 decreased the risk <b>of</b> future <b>unemployment</b> and decreased the risk of sickness absence among immigrants. The risk <b>of</b> both future <b>unemployment</b> and future sickness absence increased with the length <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> in 1992. Immigrants had higher risk <b>of</b> <b>unemployment</b> both at baseline and follow-up compared with native Swedes, but followed the pattern of native Swedes when unemployed. The conclusion are that exposure to unemployment are associated with elevated risk <b>of</b> future <b>unemployment,</b> sickness absence, disability pension and death fifteen years after exposure. To a society this will mean substantial costs in the form of increased welfare payments and loss of productivity and tax income.
