500|$|The Beatles {{achieved}} mainstream {{success in}} the UK early in 1963. Lennon was on tour when his first son, Julian, was born in April. During their Royal Variety Show performance that was attended by the Queen Mother and other British royalty, Lennon poked fun at his audience: [...] "For our next song, I'd like to ask <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>help.</b> For {{the people in the}} cheaper seats, clap your hands... and the rest of you, if you'll just rattle your jewellery." [...] After a year of Beatlemania in the UK, the group's historic February 1964 US debut appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show marked their breakthrough to international stardom. A two-year period of constant touring, moviemaking, and songwriting followed, during which Lennon wrote two books, In His Own Write and A Spaniard in the Works. The Beatles received recognition from the British Establishment when they were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1965 Queen's Birthday Honours.|$|E

2500|$|During the trial, Corby {{wrote to}} the Australian Prime Minister, John Howard, saying [...] "as a father and as a leader, I plead <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>help.</b> I did not do this. I beg for justice. I don't know how much longer I can do this. Please bring me home." [...] Of Corby, Howard said: [...] "I feel for her. I {{understand}} why there's a lot of public sympathy for her; I would simply say that I hope justice is done and it's a fair and true verdict ... I would ask the rhetorical question: My fellow Australians, if a foreigner were to come to Australia and a foreign government were to start telling us how we should handle , we would react very angrily to that." [...] The Australian Labor Party generally supported the government's approach to the case in not wanting to interfere in Indonesia's judicial system, while Australian Greens leader Bob Brown criticised the verdict.|$|E
