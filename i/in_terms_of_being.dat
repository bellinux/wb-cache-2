40|$|The essay studies Aristotle’s {{critique}} of Parmenides (Physics 1. 3) {{in the light}} of the Heideggerian account of Platonic-Aristotelian metaphysics as an approach to <b>being</b> (Sein) <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>beings</b> (das Seiende). Aristotle’s critique focuses on the presuppositions of the Parmenidean thesis of the unity <b>of</b> <b>being.</b> It is argued that a close study of the presuppositions of Aristotle’s own critique reveals an important difference between the Aristotelian metaphysical framework and the Parmenidean “protometaphysical” approach. The Parmenides fragments indicate being as such in the sense of the pure, undifferentiated “is there” (τὸ ἐόν) —as the intelligible accessibility of meaningful reality to thinking, prior to its articulation into determinate beings. For Aristotle, by contrast, “being itself” (αὐτὸ τὸ ὄν) has no other plausible meaning than “being-something-determinate as such” (τὸ ὅπερ ὄν τι), which itself remains equivocal. In this sense, Aristotle can indeed be said to conceive <b>being</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>beings,</b> as the being-ness <b>of</b> determinate <b>beings...</b>|$|R

25|$|In recent years, {{under the}} {{guidance}} of former longtime National Nine News chief Peter Meakin, Seven's news and current affairs division has produced more locally focused content, which has been lifting ratings for key markets such as Sydney and Melbourne. Since February 2005, the ratings of Deal or No Deal, Seven News and Today Tonight have gradually increased. Seven News was the highest-rating news service nationally in both the 2005 and 2006 ratings seasons. A key aspect of Seven's recent ratings dominance in news and current affairs has been attributed to Deal or No Deals (and, since late 2015, The Chase Australia) top rating audience, which provides Seven News with a large lead-in audience. Between 2007 and 2010 inclusive, Seven News completed a clean sweep across the five capital cities <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> the most watched 6pm news bulletin.

He borrowed from the library Segments II (Orchestra Of Two Continents) by pianist Cecil Taylor's band while at high school, but found separating the various elements of the music too difficult. After attending a Last Exit concert (a loud free jazz band of Peter Brötzmann, Bill Laswell, Ronald Shannon Jackson and Sonny Sharrock), he went home {{and listened to the}} Taylor album again: [...] "It was more manageable <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> able to hear detail and listen to content.

500|$|Crispy Gamer {{was created}} by Chris Heldman, head of media {{entertainment}} at Google; John Keefer, editorial director of GameSpy; Chris Hoerenz, chief marketing officer from eMusic; E2open engineer Andre Srinivasan; and Aldis Porietis.

The website announced the same day that it raised $8.25 million in venture capital from J. P. Morgan's Constellation Ventures. In February 2009, Crispy Gamer signed a syndication deal with Tribune Media Services, McClatchy Tribune Information Services, and gamerDNA.|$|E

Several others left the production, and three stuntmen broke their bones, but the Screen Actors Guild decided, following an investigation, that nothing was inherently unsafe about the set. Additionally, DiCaprio {{said there was no}} point when he felt he was in danger during filming. Cameron believed in a passionate work ethic and never apologized for the way he ran his sets, although he acknowledged:I'm demanding, and I'm demanding on my crew. <b>In</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> kind of militaresque, I think there's an element of that in dealing with thousands of extras and big logistics and keeping people safe.

[...] Linda McGee of RTÉ.ie said {{that along with}} In the Zones [...] "Brave New Girl", they were [...] "individually impressive", but disrupted {{the direction of the}} album. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly commented, [...] "With its dainty piano, 'Everytime' plays like a forlorn postmortem on her Justin Timberlake era." [...] Sterling Clover of The Village Voice called it [...] "a weeper in the best 'Time After Time' (1984) tradition." [...] William Shaw of Blender said that while [...] "Everytime" [...] was not her greatest ballad, the lyrics were [...] "certainly heartfelt". A reviewer from the Huddersfield Daily Examiner stated, [...] " [...] breathy ballad [...] got a stage musical feel to it, but Britney's no Elaine Paige".

500|$|On the {{decision}} to downplay Raziel's quest for vengeance against Kain in this sequel, Hennig explained, [...] "he's being pretty simple-minded, he's sort of being very black-and-white in his interpretation of things, and being kind of petulant [...] he's not really as heroic as Kain is, {{and he has a}} lot of stuff to figure out, basically, about what's going on". Soul Reaver 2 was crafted to feature a more cinematic, story-focused experience than its predecessor, which the developers felt had been [...] "patchy" [...] in this regard. It entered production after Blood Omen 2, but shipped almost six months before the latter game. A separate team within Crystal Dynamics, with creative autonomy, developed Blood Omen 2, and contradictions created by its scenario hindered work on Soul Reaver 2. After researching time travel fiction, Hennig devised a subplot concerning temporal paradoxes to resolve the continuity problems between both titles, and established that Blood Omen 2s story is a product of the final paradox created when Kain saves Raziel at the end of Soul Reaver 2. Other themes were inspired by the works of Joseph Campbell, and theology surrounding Gnosticism. Concepts which formulated the crux of the story included the idea [...] "that the only way a hero can ever succeed is by following his own path", and the question, [...] "can you change history or not? And if so, what does it mean to change history - <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> responsible for the repercussions?" ...|$|E

[...] MTV News wrote that [...] "Daddy" [...] {{is different from the}} other relationship songs on Dangerously in Love, and added that it has a powerful message. By contrast, Allison Stewart of The Washington Post and Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times both called [...] "Daddy" [...] a [...] "creepy bonus track". Similarly, Spence D., writing for IGN Music stated that [...] "Daddy" [...] is not really worth uncovering, as it follows suit <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> [...] "a by-the-books contempo R rendition", and he commented that [...] "there is something oddly eerie about an attractive woman such as Beyoncé crooning the words 'I want my husband to be like my Daddy.'" [...] Mike Wass of the website Idolator called the song one of the [...] "duds" [...] on the album and added that it was a [...] "best forgotten ode to the superstar's father complete with stomach-churning lyrics like 'I want my husband to be like my daddy'". In 2014, Louis Virtel of the website HitFix reviewed the song negatively, calling it the worst on Dangerously in Love and describing its lyrics as [...] "seriously simplistic". [...] "Daddy" [...] peaked at number 26 on the Billboard Hot RingMasters charts in the United States in 2014.|$|E
