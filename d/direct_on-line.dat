40|$|A new {{analytical}} technique, gradient chromatofocusing-mass spectrometry (gCF-MS), {{was developed}} employing ion-exchange {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) interfaced to an electrospray-quadrupole mass spectrometer in the determination of proteins. There have been few reports, if any, of a HPLC-MS technique for proteins in which the ion-exchange column is directly interfaced to the mass spectrometer. The employment of a linear pH gradient elution scheme directly interfaced to mass spectrometry is also unique in the present work. The technique was demonstrated by the separation of six proteins (carbonic anhydrase II, enolase, β-lactoglobulin A, lactoglobulin B, soybean trypsin inhibitor, and amyloglucosidase) employing a descending linear pH gradient from pH 9 to 2. 6 on a 50 mm × 2. 1 mm DEAE HPLC column using volatile buffer components.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 66 - 68) An Active Noise Control (ANC) {{system uses}} an adaptive cancellation filter {{to generate a}} secondary noise to cancel the primary noise. The adaptation algorithm used in the ANC system is the filtered-U RLMS algorithm, which requires the estimation filter to identify the error-path correctly. In order to track the dynamic error-path changes, an adaptive on-line modeling technique is necessary. Since there exists a complicated interaction between the cancellation and estimation filters, the on-line modeling technique is difficult to implement in realtime applications. This thesis proposes a new on-line modeling technique based on an automatic <b>direct</b> <b>on-line</b> modeling control algorithm. This will reduce {{the interaction between the}} cancellation and estimation filters such that the on-line modeling technique can be implemented in real-time. This automatic direct online modeling control algorithm uses the cross-correlation estimate ρ(η) between the error signal and the cancellation filter output to control the adaptation of the estimation filter. Since the cross-correlation between the error signal and the cancellation filter output is low after the ANC system has converged, the new algorithm freezes the adaptation of the estimation filter. When the error-path changes, the cross-correlation estimate is increasing due to the reduction of noise attenuation. Therefore the estimation filter updates its coefficients again. The results of the computer simulation and real-time experiment show that the automatic <b>direct</b> <b>on-line</b> modeling control algorithm improves the performance of the <b>direct</b> <b>on-line</b> modeling algorithm. Three other on-line modeling techniques were also evaluated and are as follows: additional random noise on-line modeling, overall system on-line modeling, and robust adaptive on-line modeling algorithms. The acoustic feedback from the cancellation filter output to the input microphone not only causes stability problems for the ANC system, but also makes it difficult for the estimation filter to identify the error-path correctly. Computer simulation results show that neither the additional random noise algorithm nor the overall system on-line modeling algorithm can remove the bias in the estimation filter because of the acoustic feedback. Although the robust adaptive on-line modeling technique shows better performance, the small step-size used in the algorithm makes it difficult to implement in real-time. Therefore, the most important contribution of this thesis is that the proposed new algorithm supports a more robust ANC system to perform on-line modeling in real-time. M. S.

40|$|RATIONALE For Newborn Screening (NBS) {{programs}} {{all over}} the world whole blood dried on filter paper, also referred to as dried blood spots (DBS), has been the standard specimen for decades. In recent years DBS have attracted the attention of pharmaceutical companies, mostly due to the low volume of collected sample and simplified, therefore more cost-efficient, transportation requirements. However, the classical NBS workflow did not totally fulfil the needs of their studies, especially with respect to high-throughput unassisted sample processing for tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analysis. Automated on-line extraction systems for direct analysis have already been tested and proved to be suitable for these pharmaceutical applications. METHODS The suitability of the automated CAMAG DBS-MS 500 interface for simultaneous detection of amino acids and (acyl-) carnitines has been tested together with an Acquity TQD tandem mass spectrometer from Waters and MassChrom stable isotope labelled internal standards from Chromsystems. No chromatographic sample treatment was applied; instead, the extract was directly injected into the MS/MS instrument. The feasibility of the instrumental setting for the routine newborn screening was tested on original samples coming from previously diagnosed patients. RESULTS The performance of the automated extraction technique and its application in preliminary quantitative screening for amino acids and (acyl-) carnitines for NBS showed very promising results. Several samples from patients, each diagnosed with one of four different inborn errors of metabolism (IEM), were tested and the correlation with the conventional punch-and-elute approach was very good.
