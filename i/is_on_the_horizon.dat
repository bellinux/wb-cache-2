Until the early 21st century SKM played an insignificant role in the local transport system and was largely replaced by trains from PKP Intercity. In 2014, however, nearly one-third of the SKM fleet was rebuilt {{in a way which}} has produced almost brand-new cars. An order for new cars <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon,</b> and the SKM is entering a constant phase of modernization and improvement.|$|E
25|$|Freedom at {{last from}} the prison of The Maze would come with Kurelek's later {{conversion}} to Roman Catholicism; this evolution is depicted in the film William Kurelek's The Maze. In 1971, he painted Out of the Maze which he presented {{as a gift to}} Maudsley Hospital. The work depicts Kurelek with his wife and four children saying grace at a picnic near a pond on the prairie. Ostensibly an image of peace, the painting holds reminders of a darker Kurelek vision. In the bottom left corner, a bisected skull reminds the viewer of the artist's troubled past. And in the far upper right, a dark storm <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>horizon.</b>|$|E
