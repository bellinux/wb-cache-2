40|$|<b>Defective</b> <b>works</b> {{are one of}} {{the major}} issue in the Malaysian {{construction}} industry which have been the main concerned by the industry players, especially the employer. Although everyone in the industry is aware of this problem, the <b>defective</b> building <b>works</b> are still unpreventable and cause a lot of claims and litigation in the industry. In the context of construction law, the little known common law right of abatement can provide an employer with the entitlement, by way of defence to a contractor’s claim, to reduce sums otherwise payable to contractors by asserting that the sum claimed has not been earned. A typical example arises in circumstances where an employer asserts that the value of works claimed by a contractor should be reduced on account of defects in those works. To date, abatement has not achieved the same status as the similar and inter-linked defence of set-off. This common law right to abate will provide an alternative to the employer as a defence for claim for <b>defective</b> <b>works.</b> Unlike set-off, abatement is a common law rights which can be used by all the parties in the industry without having to serve any early notice or need to be stated clearly in the conditions of contract. In view of the above, this study has been conducted and the data are collected using Lexis-Nexis database. Subsequently, related cases are gathered and analysed. There are three main principles of abatement and one principle on measure of damages in abatement has been indentified.

40|$|The {{current trends}} in the {{construction}} industry are now moving toward higher quality. Contractors are forced to upgrade the quality of their services. The implementation of total quality management (TQM) becomes necessary {{in the construction industry}}. It is actually the set of activities that are performed by the contractor for the customer satisfaction. The main reason for the introduction of the TQM in the construction industry is the knowledge level of the customer which is increasing gradually regarding to the quality issues. Therefore, this elevation in the knowledge level of the client results demand for the better quality, because in many construction projects clients often find themselves paying high prices for <b>defective</b> <b>works</b> that don’t satisfy their needs. The objectives of this paper are 1) to investigate the awareness of the contractors in Libya with regards to TQM, level of customer satisfaction and the government interventions for quality. This research was a cross sectional survey conducted in the capital of Libya Tripoli. This study found that the Libyan Government is stressing on allocation of high budget for construction, so far no importance is shown regarding to the ISO implementation. This study reflects the situation of Libyan construction industry regarding to the quality practices. The knowledge level among the Libyan construction industry is moderate and the implementation within the organisation is also at a grass root level, this is because of lack of consideration of a quality system in the Libyan construction industry. There is a need of immediate initiative by the government and the ministry of housing building and planning to stress on implementation of TQM and ISO certification within the Libyan construction industry to attain better customer services and quality construction. Libyan government can {{play a vital role in}} this regard by stressing on adopting ISO and TQM practices in Libyan construction industry.

There is speculation that Thomas may have been Robert's disciple. Renaud de Cormont, continued his fathers work on Notre-Dame of Amiens in the 1240s, believed to bring a form of architectural revolution to upper transept and upper choir of Amiens Cathedral through his introduction of a glazed triforium, openwork flyers, and new decorative forms. Renaud altered the eastern wall of the transept and upper levels of the choir into an ornate glass box held by extremely thin flyers. This failed monumentally: the triforium had to be replaced, the tracery panels on the flyers crumbled and the transept roses failed. Of more concern was the fact that the entire eastern half of the building needed to be held up using wooden beams, iron chain, masonry spines and an additional rank of flyers. Because of this, art historians have likened him to an Icarus whose <b>defective</b> <b>work</b> on the upper transept and choir led to a near disaster, likely a play on the fact that the center of Amines Cathedral contains a labyrinth designed on the floor and his father, or Daedalus in this case, had worked on the cathedral before him.|$|E
