5|$|In February 2013, a self-declared Pastafarian {{was denied}} the right to wear a {{spaghetti}} strainer on his head for his driver's license photo by the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission, which stated that a pasta strainer was not on a list of approved religious <b>headwear.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cartman {{is usually}} {{depicted}} wearing winter attire {{which consists of}} a red coat, brown pants, yellow gloves/mittens, and a yellow-brimmed turquoise knit cap tapered with a yellow pom-pom. He has parted brown hair, and he is seen without his hat more often than the other characters with distinctive <b>headwear.</b> As he is overweight, his body is wider, his hands noticeably larger and his head is a more elliptical shape {{in contrast to the}} circular heads of the other children. An additional curved line on his lower face represents a double chin.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} {{employs the}} Scout method, a programme of informal education {{with an emphasis}} on practical outdoor activities, including camping, woodcraft, aquatics, hiking, backpacking, and sports. Another widely recognized movement characteristic is the Scout uniform, by intent hiding all differences of social standing in a country and making for equality, with neckerchief and campaign hat or comparable <b>headwear.</b> Distinctive uniform insignia include the fleur-de-lis and the trefoil, as well as badges and other patches.|$|E
5|$|To this end, {{a crew of}} 12 {{prepared}} a ship that had been seized in Gibraltar. They disguised vertical logs of wood with <b>headwear,</b> to make the Spaniards believe that the vessel was fully crewed. To make it look more heavily armed, additional portholes were cut in the hull and logs placed to resemble cannons. Barrels of powder {{were placed in the}} ship and grappling irons laced into the ships rigging, to catch the ropes and sails of Magdalen and ensure the vessels would become entangled.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Pollack’s career {{led into}} politics. A summer {{internship}} with the American Jewish Congress prompted a one-year role with the AJC. He {{worked as a}} lobbyist on legislation that would permit religious <b>headwear</b> for active military personal in noncombat settings. Pollack then relocated to Los Angeles to work for Winner & Associates, a leading political public relations firm. He was assigned to consult the Major Baseball League during the labor strife in the early-1990s. The inception of Pollack’s career in sports business occurred in 1992 when he realized—while flying from LA to New York—that there was a niche {{to fill in the}} industry.|$|E
5|$|The {{characters}} and objects {{are composed of}} simple geometrical shapes and primary colors. Most child characters are {{the same size and}} shape, and are distinguished by their clothing, hair and skin colors, and <b>headwear.</b> Characters are mostly presented two-dimensionally and from only one angle. Their movements are animated in an intentionally jerky fashion, as they are purposely not offered the same free range of motion associated with hand-drawn characters. Occasionally, some non-fictional characters are depicted with photographic cutouts of their actual head and face in lieu of a face reminiscent of the show's traditional style. Canadians on the show are often portrayed in an even more minimalist fashion; they have simple beady eyes, and the top halves of their heads simply flap up and down when the characters speak.|$|E
25|$|The {{misinterpretation}} of some regulations {{has led to}} {{the confusion}} that certain universities do not prescribe <b>headwear,</b> most notably the Open University where the policy is that academic headgear is not worn at graduation ceremonies, whilst some universities have abandoned <b>headwear</b> for socio-political reasons or because the designer intended it, such as is the case of Vivienne Westwood and her design for King's College London.|$|E
25|$|The {{style of}} cap is also {{often used as}} {{official}} <b>headwear</b> as part of school uniforms for boys from private schools, particularly in the United Kingdom and throughout the Commonwealth of Nations. Although not common in the modern period, the cricket cap {{used to be a}} fashionable form of <b>headwear</b> for people who were casually dressed, and not necessarily worn just for playing the game.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{epaulette}} insignia, MSC grades do {{wear the}} same decoration on their <b>headwear</b> as the equivalent regular rank. S/Insps wear flat caps with a raised black band on the cap (or under the force crest on female hats). ACOs where a raised single row of silver oak leaves on their cap (identical to Commander rank) while the CO wear two raised rows of silver oak leaves (identical to Deputy Assistant Commissioners and above). As well as <b>headwear,</b> senior MSC grades also wear lapel decoration identical to regular senior officers on their tunics.|$|E

25|$|As {{one might}} imagine, a woman's outfit was not {{complete}} without {{some kind of}} <b>headwear.</b> As with today, a medieval woman had many options- from straw hats, to hoods to elaborate headpieces. A woman's activity and occasion would dictate what she wore on her head.|$|E

25|$|This {{incident}} {{had another}} effect: the first helmets appeared on batsmen's heads. Initially, Englishman Dennis Amiss sported a motorcycle helmet when batting in WSC, {{and he was}} quickly followed by many other players. Protective cricket equipment developed rapidly, {{and by the end}} of WSC, virtually all batsmen in WSC and official Test matches were sporting some form of protective <b>headwear.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Ron Magill Show – Zoo Miami's Ron Magill takes {{calls from}} {{listeners}} with their {{questions about the}} animal kingdom, usually concluding with Magill doing a play-by-play commentary of an animal video. Usually this segment is on Tuesdays, {{it is one of}} the few regular segments offering call-ins and is marked by the hosts donning pith helmets (even over their usual <b>headwear).</b> Le Batard maintains it is the most popular segment of the show every week.|$|E
25|$|Fashion Bonnets {{for outdoor}} wear had small brims that {{revealed}} the face. Earlier bonnets {{of the decade}} had lower brims. However, by mid-century Spoon Bonnets, which featured increasingly high brims and more elaborate trimmings, became the vogue. Bonnets were made specifically to accessorize a dress. Other less common variants, such as the Marie Stuart Bonnet, with its heart-shaped brim, and the fanchon bonnet, with its very short brim and back curtain, made appearances {{in the realm of}} fashionable <b>headwear.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{dress of}} the Monpa {{is based on}} the Tibetan Chuba. Both men and women wear <b>headwear</b> made of yak hair, with long tassels.

25|$|A cricket cap {{is a type}} of soft cap, {{often made}} from felt, that is a {{traditional}} form of <b>headwear</b> for players of the game of cricket, regardless of age or gender. It is usually a tight-fitting skullcap, usually made of six or eight sections, with a small crescent shaped brim that points downwards over the brow to provide shade for the eyes. It is often, but not always, elasticised at the rear to hold it in place upon the wearer's head. Sometimes, rather than tight-fitting, the cricket cap comes in a baggy variety, that is always kept in place by elastic.|$|E
25|$|Roddick {{also uses}} Babolat Propulse III tennis shoes, which are his {{signature}} gear. From 2000 to 2005, Roddick wore Reebok apparel. After Reebok {{announced it would}} not renew its contract with Roddick, Roddick signed a five-year, $25 million endorsement deal with Lacoste in April 2005. In November, he signed an agreement to endorse Lacoste eyewear for four years worth between $750,000 and $1 million. In June 2013, Roddick became an investor and brand ambassador to TravisMathew Apparel. Roddick, as well as fellow former American tennis players James Blake and Mardy Fish, wear TravisMathew's TM Red <b>headwear,</b> shirts and shorts during matches.|$|E
25|$|Major {{clothing}} brands {{associated with}} bushwear are the broad brimmed Akubra hats, Driza-Bone coats and R.M. Williams bushmen's outfitters (featuring in particular: moleskin trousers, riding boots and merino woolwear). Blundstone Footwear and Country Road are also linked to this tradition. Made from {{the leaves of}} Livistona australis, the cabbage tree hat was the first uniquely Australian <b>headwear,</b> {{dating back to the}} early 1800s, and was the hat of choice for colonial-born Australians. Traditionally worn by jackaroos and swagmen in the blow-fly infested Australian outback, the cork hat is a type of headgear strongly associated with Australia, and comprises cork strung from the brim, to ward off insects.|$|E
25|$|A crown is a {{traditional}} symbolic form of <b>headwear</b> worn by a monarch or by a deity, for whom the crown traditionally represents power, legitimacy, victory, triumph, honor, and glory, as well as immortality, righteousness, and resurrection. In art, the crown may be shown being offered to those on Earth by angels. Apart from the traditional form, crowns also {{may be in the}} form of a wreath and be made of flowers, oak leaves, or thorns and be worn by others, representing what the coronation part aims to symbolize with the specific crown. In religious art, a crown of stars is used similarly to a halo. Crowns worn by rulers often contain jewels.|$|E
25|$|Revox went {{one step}} further: after much {{hesitation}} {{about whether to}} accept cassettes as a medium capable for meeting their strict standards from reel-to-reel recorders at all, they produced their B710MK I (Dolby B) and MK II (Dolby B) machines. Both cassette units possessed double capstan drives, but with two independent, electronically controlled capstan motors and two separate reel motors. The head assembly moved by actuating a damped solenoid movement, eliminating all belt drives and other wearable parts. These machines rivaled the Nakamichi in frequency and dynamic range. The B710MKII also achieved 20–20,000Hz and dynamics of over 72dB with Dolby C on chrome and slightly less dynamic range, but greater headroom with metal tapes and Dolby C. Revox adjusted the frequency range on delivery with many years of use in mind: when new, the frequency curve went upwards a few dB at 15–20kHz, aiming for flat response after 15 years of use, and <b>headwear</b> to match.|$|E
25|$|The Corps was {{enlarged}} to ten squadrons by {{the start}} of the Seven Years' War. Their depot was in Strasbourg, where it remained for a century. On 13 May 1758, the Corps was renamed Royal carabiniers de monsieur le Comte de Provence. By 1762, the Corps was enlarged to five brigades of thirty squadrons, but was reduced to two regiments in 1788. However, the events of the French Revolution affected all of the French Army and the cavalry Arm in particular, and the carabiniers were reduced to two regiments of four squadrons each, later serving in the Army of the Rhine. The regiments retained their distinctive bearskin <b>headwear</b> until 1810 when it was replaced by even more distinctive helmets with scarlet combs. They were also distinguished by Napoleon with a brass overlay on the iron cuirasses after suffering heavy casualties in the 1809 campaign, but were no longer equipped with carabines. The two Carabiniers regiments, brigaded together and as a part of General of Division Nansouty's 1st Heavy Cavalry Division saw action during the Napoleonic wars, including in the Battle of Austerlitz, Battle of Friedland, Battle of Wagram, Battle of Borodino (commanded by General of Brigade Defrance), Battle of Leipzig, Battle of Laon and Battle of Waterloo. The Carabiniers were restored as a single régiment de Monsieur after the second Bourbon restoration.|$|E
500|$|Costume {{designer}} Ha Nguyen also demonstrates this {{contrast in}} the clothing of the cast. The film {{starts with the}} prisoners having their clothing divided by ethnicity, with African Americans wearing different <b>headwear,</b> Latinos wearing vests and various arm accessories, and the White Americans in cut-off T-shirts. After the arrival of General Irwin, the prisoners start wearing more similar clothing in a [...] "sharp military manner". The uniforms of the prisoners change from the usual chocolate brown color to light grey, because of its muddled look on film and excessive darkness in some scenes. Ha Nguyen also contrasted the non-battlefield ribbons found on Colonel Winter's uniform with the battlefield medals found on General Irwin's uniform (seen only in the opening scene as Irwin is inducted into the prison).|$|E
500|$|In June 2012, Marvel filed eleven {{trademark}} {{applications for}} Guardians of the Galaxy, covering {{a variety of}} consumer products, from video games to cosmetics. Disney Consumer Products partnered with Mad Engine, C-Life, New Era, Hasbro, Disguise, Rubies, Sideshow Collectibles, Lego, KIDdesigns, iHome, Funko, Freeze, Fast Forward, and Innovative Designs to produce merchandise for the film, with releases starting in June 2014. Mad Engine and C-Life were partnered as the core apparel outfitters, producing a line of T-shirts and fleece jackets, while New Era produced <b>headwear</b> and hats. Hasbro produced toys for the film; Disguise and Rubies produced the costumes; and Sideshow Collectibles was given charge of the collectibles. Lego announced three toy sets based on scenes from the film, while iHome created character speakers, Funko made vinyl bobble heads, Freeze crafted 1980s-inspired apparel, and backpacks and stationery were made by Fast Forward and Innovative Designs. Despite first films in a potential new franchise usually being off-limits to licensees, Marvel used Iron Mans success as evidence of unknown characters becoming hits with audiences to attract partnerships. Licensees embraced Rocket as the film's potential breakout character, with Drax and Gamora being used for older demographics; Star-Lord’s obsession with 1980s nostalgia, including his [...] "Awesome Mix Vo. 1" [...] cassette, has {{also served as a}} basis for tie-in products. In August 2014, Funko announced a toy based on [...] "Dancing Groot", while in October 2014, Marvel and KID designs announced a replica of dancing Groot, for release in December 2014.|$|E
500|$|This {{arrangement}} of allowing competitive industry to flourish {{in some regions}} while setting up its opposite of strict government-regulated and monopolized production and trade in others was not exclusive to iron manufacturing. In {{the beginning of the}} Song, the government supported competitive silk mills and brocade workshops in the eastern provinces and in the capital city of Kaifeng. However, {{at the same time the}} government established strict legal prohibition on the merchant trade of privately produced silk in Sichuan province. This prohibition dealt an economic blow to Sichuan that caused a small rebellion (which was subdued), yet Song Sichuan was well known for its independent industries producing timber and cultivated oranges. [...] The reforms of the Chancellor Wang Anshi (10211086) sparked heated debate amongst ministers of court when he nationalised the industries manufacturing, processing, and distributing tea, salt, and wine. [...] The state monopoly on Sichuan tea was the prime source of revenue for the state's purchase of horses in Qinghai for the Song army's cavalry forces. Wang's restrictions on the private manufacture and trade of salt were even criticized in a famous poem by Su Shi, and while the opposing politically charged faction at court gained advantage and lost favor, Wang Anshi's reforms were continually abandoned and reinstated. Despite this political quarrel, the Song Empire's main source of revenue continued to come from state-managed monopolies and indirect taxes. As for private entrepreneurship, great profits could still be pursued by the merchants in the luxury item trades and specialized regional production. For example, the silk producers of Raoyang County, Shenzhou Prefecture, southern Hebei province were especially known for producing silken <b>headwear</b> for the Song emperor and high court officials in the capital.|$|E
500|$|Jardine was {{the centre}} of {{attention}} {{at the start of}} the tour. He began the tour with three consecutive hundreds and was seen as one of the main English threats. In his first hundred, the crowd engaged in some good-natured joking at Jardine's expense, but he was jeered by the crowd in his second hundred for batting too slowly. His third hundred was described by Bradman as one of the finest exhibitions of strokeplay that he had seen; Jardine accelerated after another slow start, during which he was again barracked, to play some excellent shots. The crowds took an increasing dislike to him, partially for his success with the bat, but mainly for his superior attitude and bearing, his awkward fielding, and particularly his choice of <b>headwear.</b> His first public action in South Australia was to take out the members of the South Australian team who had been to Oxford or Cambridge Universities. Then, he wore a Harlequin cap, given to people who played good cricket at Oxford. It was not unusual for Oxford and Cambridge cricketers to wear similar caps while batting, as both Jardine and M.C.C. captain Percy Chapman did so on this tour, although it was slightly unorthodox to wear them while fielding. However, this was neither understood nor acceptable to the Australian crowds. They quickly took exception to the importance he seemed to place on class distinction. Although Jardine may simply have worn the cap out of superstition, it conveyed a negative impression to the spectators, with his general demeanour drawing one comment of [...] "Where's the butler to carry the bat for you?" [...] Jardine's cap became a focus for criticism and mockery from the crowds throughout the tour. Nevertheless, Jack Fingleton later claimed that Jardine could still have brought the crowds onto his side by exchanging jokes or pleasantries with them. It is certain that Jardine by this stage had developed an intense dislike for Australian crowds. During his third century {{at the start of the}} tour, during a period of abuse from the spectators, he observed to a sympathetic Hunter Hendry that [...] "All Australians are uneducated, and an unruly mob". After the innings, when Patsy Hendren said that the Australian crowds did not like Jardine, he replied [...] "It's fucking mutual". Due to the large number of good close fielders in the side, Jardine did not field in the slips, his usual position for Surrey, but next to the crowd on the boundary. There, he was roundly abused and mocked, particularly when chasing the ball: he was not a good fielder on the boundary. In one of the Test matches, he spat towards the crowd while fielding on the boundary as he changed position for the final time.|$|E
