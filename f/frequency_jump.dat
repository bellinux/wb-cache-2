The four-man crew consists of the commander, driver, gunner and loader. The driver's hatch is on the front left of the hull roof. The commander is seated {{on the left side of}} the turret, with the gunner to his front and the loader on the right. The TR-85 has a cramped crew compartment, a characteristic of the T-54/55 series.

The TR-85M1 also has a turret bustle, but this does not alleviate the crew comfort because of the additional equipment of the modernized version. Although there are no height limits for tank recruits in the Romanian Army, the recommended maximum height is 1.68m as in practice anyone taller will have to sit in an uncomfortable position with limited physical movement.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{evolution}} of a trapped atomic cloud subject to a trapping <b>frequency</b> <b>jump</b> for two cases: stationary and moving center of mass. In the first case, the <b>frequency</b> <b>jump</b> initiates oscillations in the cloud's momentum and size. At certain times we find the temperature is significantly reduced. When the oscillation amplitude becomes large enough, local density increases induced by the anharmonicity of the trapping potential are observed. In the second case, the oscillations are coupled to the center of mass motion through the anharmonicity of the potential. This induces oscillations with even larger amplitudes, enhancing the temperature reduction effects and leading to nonisotropic expansion rates while expanding freely.

TC rotors are usually supported on floating ring bearings (FRBs) or semi-floating ring bearings (SFRBs), {{both of which are}} inexpensive to manufacture. However, fluid film bearings are highly nonlinear components of TC units and contribute to the complex behavior (i. e. bifurcations and frequency jumps between a first whirl frequency and a second whirl frequency) of the entire rotor-bearing system (RBS). The <b>frequency</b> <b>jump</b> phenomenon concerns the TC manufacturing industry due to increased levels of noise generation. This thesis presents progress on assessing the effects of some bearing parameters and operating conditions on the RBS dynamic forced performance and the <b>frequency</b> <b>jump</b> phenomenon. A fluid film bearing model is integrated into a finite element rotordynamics computational model for numerical prediction of the TC linear and nonlinear (time transient) forced response. Since automotive TCs operate with variable rotational speed, predictions are conducted with shaft acceleration/deceleration. Over most of its operating speed range, TC rotor nonlinear response predictions display two subsynchronous whirl frequencies w 1 and w 2 representing a conical mode and a cylindrical bending mode, respectively. At low shaft speeds w 1 is present up to a shaft speed (Omega bifurcation), where there is a <b>frequency</b> <b>jump</b> from w 1 to w 2. The second whirl frequency may persist up to the highest shaft speeds (depending on operating conditions). Results show during rotor deceleration the Omega bifurcation may be different from the one during rotor acceleration (hysteresis). Predictions show the following factors delay the Omega bifurcation: increasing oil supply pressure, decreasing oil supply temperature, and increasing shaft acceleration. Also, rotor imbalance distribution greatly affects Omega bifurcation and the shaft amplitude of total motion. Overall, this study shows the sensitivity of bifurcations and <b>frequency</b> <b>jump</b> phenomenon in TC nonlinear response due to various bearing parameters and operating conditions. Further analysis is required to generalize these findings and to assess the effect of other bearing parameters (i. e. clearances, outer film length, ring rotation, etc.) on this phenomenon.

40|$|Although {{much work}} has been done on the physics of vocalizations caused by the {{vibrating}} motion of vocal folds, relatively little {{work has been}} done on the physics of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs). There are two orders of mammals known to make these kind of vocalizations: cetaceans and rodents. Of these two the mechanism behind the rodent calls are better understood. Thus, this thesis investigates the physics of rodent USVs with the hope that findings will help elucidate the mechanisms behind cetacean USVs. Chapter 1 discusses the anatomical background of rodent vocal tracts, evolutionary pressures that shaped the development of USVs, physical modeling of vibrating vocal folds, and experimental work that discounts the possibility of vibrating vocal folds as the mechanism behind rodent USVs. Chapter 2 discusses acoustic and fluid dynamics background as well as a previously proposed physical model, known as the hole tone, for the rodent USV mechanism. Chapter 3 discusses an original data analysis of rodent USVs. This analysis exploits the presence of <b>frequency</b> <b>jumps</b> in the USVs. These <b>frequency</b> <b>jumps</b> are extracted. A machine learning model is then used to fit the <b>frequency</b> <b>jumps</b> to acoustic equations. The results of this analysis show that the hole tone model is incorrect. Chapter 4 discusses original modeling of the rodent vocal production mechanism, in which the rodent vocal tract is treated as a resonator driven by a jet of air emerging from the vocal folds. This representation of the rodent vocal tract is used to derive a set of time domain acoustic oscillator equations, which describe the transient acoustics of rodent USVs. It is found in chapter 4 that an additional driving mechanism is needed in the oscillator equations, or the acoustic oscillations will decay to a fixed point. Chapter 5 discusses several attempts at including this driving mechanism by considering the forcing that results from the formation of vortex rings in the rodent vocal tract. First, a linear frequency domain approach is attempted. However, it is found that this approach is incompatible with the time domain equations of chapter 4. Next, a nonlinear time domain approach is attempted. This approach is compatible with the time domain equations of chapter 4, and solves the decay problem that occurs without the additional driving force. Furthermore, the model is able to reproduce the 22 kHz alarm call made by rats. However, it is unable to produce the higher harmonics or the <b>frequency</b> <b>jumps</b> observed in rodent USVs. It is concluded that the model is successful in producing the fundamental frequency of the rodent vocal tract, but it seems to be neglecting a mechanism which can account for the higher harmonics and the <b>frequency</b> <b>jumps...</b>|$|R

In this work {{we assume that the}} random jumps can be modelled by a compound Poisson process, independent of the other stochastic and deterministic processes affecting the clock stability. Then, we derive the analytical expression of the Allan variance of a jumping clock. We find that the analytical Allan variance does not depend on the actual shape of the jumps amplitude distribution, but only on its first and second moments, and its final form is the same as for a clock with a random walk of frequency and a frequency drift. We conclude that the Allan variance cannot distinguish between a compound Poisson process and a Wiener process, hence it may not be sufficient to correctly identify the fundamental noise processes affecting a clock. The result is general and applicable to any oscillator, whose frequency is affected by a jump process with the described statistics...|$|R
