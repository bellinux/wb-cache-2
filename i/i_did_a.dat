5|$|I {{started doing}} {{different}} charity events where <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> combination of 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero'. We {{made it into}} a medley {{and put them in}} the same key and made it work. People responded really well to it. It's been interesting for me, since the events of September11, the way people have been playing 'Hero' and really even talking to me about 'Never Too Far', 'cause that song is also about loss. I figured that it would be a nice thing to do, to put them both out for Christmas. There's also an unreleased track on the B-side, which is called 'There for Me' which kind of has the same sentiment. The proceeds from 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero' and 'There for Me' are going to go to the Heroes Fund, and it's going to benefit police officers' families, relief workers' families.|$|E
25|$|I made {{a mistake}} going into that fight. I knew Conn was kinda small and I didn't want them {{to say in the}} papers that I beat up on some little guy so the day before the fight <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> little roadwork to break a sweat and drank as little water as {{possible}} so I could weigh in under 200pounds. Chappie was as mad as hell. But Conn was a clever fighter, he was like a mosquito, he'd sting and move.|$|E

500|$|Guest star Ed Lauter had {{previously}} {{worked with the}} episode's director, William A. Graham, on the film [...] On {{his role in the}} episode, Lauter has stated [...] "I don’t really have {{a lot to say about}} that, except I thought <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> nice job, and that it was nice working up there in Vancouver with David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson".|$|E
500|$|... "After I {{showed the}} film to George , at an hour and 55 minutes, {{we looked at each}} other," [...] Spielberg remembered. [...] "The first thing that we said was, 'Too fast'. We needed to {{decelerate}} the action. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> few more matte shots to slow it down. We made it a little bit slower, by putting breathing room back in so there'd be a two-hour oxygen supply for the audience." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} Red Hot Chili Peppers, he {{switched}} to using a Yamaha SG as his primary guitar for his solo work. Frusciante has also noted his increased use of the Roland MC-202 for his electronic music, {{saying that he was}} at the point [...] "where I thought as much like a 202ist as <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> guitarist..." [...] The MC-202 has been his primary melodic instrument in his electronic music.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} year in 1957, Marchant unexpectedly left the sport, {{much to the}} dismay of the cycling community, which believed that he would continue to more success. He switched to playing Australian rules football because that was what his friends did. He felt that fitting in with his friends was more important, saying [...] "I was a funny bloke. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> lot on brilliance rather than hard work. I preferred to do what my mates were doing." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{head coach}} dealt with young players who {{differed}} from the white, East-Coast students {{with whom he had}} previously worked. At the beginning, he used the then-customary coaching methods of rough language and a strict routine. The Native American students were unaccustomed to such an approach, and several key players stopped attending practices. Warner adjusted his technique, saying that he [...] "found I could get better results. I don't think I ever swore at a player from that time. Maybe <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> little cussing, now and then, but never at players." ...|$|E
500|$|Regarding Broadway, MacFarlane told The Hollywood Reporter, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> Broadway musical, I'd {{probably}} {{want to do something}} a little bit more old-fashioned", and went on saying [...] "I wouldn't necessarily do something that was as edgy as what they ] and [...] have done. The challenge to me would be more along the lines of, gosh, can somebody write Oklahoma! for 2011?" [...] He has also said that, [...] "The good thing about Broadway is that you don't have to worry about an airdate. It gets done when it gets done." ...|$|E

500|$|The role of Martha was {{originally}} played by Burcin Kapkin upon her introduction in 1988. In 2005 the character {{returned to the}} show, played by the model Jodi Gordon. Gordon took acting lessons before successfully auditioning for the role. Gordon later revealed that she was initially nervous about auditioning due to her lack of acting experience. However, producers gave her two months prior to filming so she could learn her scripts and gain more acting skills. Gordon said, [...] "I'd never done any acting. So <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> few little acting course things and then I kind of fluked the part".|$|E
500|$|The arrest {{occurred}} {{about two}} weeks before the release of Grant's first major studio film, Nine Months, which he was scheduled to promote on several American television shows. The Tonight Show with Jay Leno had him booked for the same week. In the much-watched interview, Grant was noted for not making excuses for the incident after Leno asked him, [...] "What the hell were you thinking?" [...] Grant answered, [...] "I think you know in life what's {{a good thing to do}} and what's a bad thing, and <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> bad thing. And there you have it." ...|$|E
500|$|Arad later explained, [...] "We {{were working}} on what we called Spider-Man 4 {{and it was the}} same team [...] The problem was we didn't have a story that was strong enough and {{warranted}} ... another movie. And Sam Raimi ... realized we [...] have a good reason to make another one. And between [...] and Tobey and obviously the studio, we all went into it not feeling good about the next story." [...] Tolmach said one reason to restart the series was that the producers felt the core Spider-Man story was that of a boy becoming a man. Screenwriter Steve Kloves did a polish of Sargent's script, saying he had originally declined the opportunity to do so but relented [...] "as a favor" [...] to the filmmakers. [...] "I also really wanted to write for Emma Stone, because I like to write for women and I particularly like Emma," [...] he explained. [...] "So ...I did basically character and dialogue, and that was enjoyable for me. So that was my hand in it. And <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> little plot work, {{but a lot of the}} plot was done." [...] He did [...] "a little bit" [...] of dialog for Peter Parker / Spider-Man. In April 2012, writer-director Paul Feig said that Webb [...] "invited me on set, and <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> little bit of writing for that movie, for one of the high school scenes".|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} published in December 2003, Kevin Moore {{revealed that he}} had started work on a third Chroma Key album, but had put it aside {{to work on the}} first OSI album, Office of Strategic Influence. When Moore stopped working on Chroma Key material, he had already recorded two songs. [...] "The big difference with the new [...] is that there are more real instruments," [...] Moore said. [...] "I've hooked up with a bunch of friends that made hand drums and didgeridoos. And <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> lot of recording with that. This new Chroma Key {{is going to be more}} organic, and less digital." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike in a {{traditional}} film soundtrack, Moore often wrote music [...] "not necessarily to always match the images on the screen, but to sometimes play against it." [...] Moore explained that {{a traditional}} soundtrack needs to convey {{the mood of the}} scene and advance the film's storyline, but {{that he did not have}} to do that with Graveyard Mountain Home [...] "because the director's not around". [...] "I thought, well what would it be like if <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> totally different kind of mood than this scene is trying to convey? When you put that music with that scene what happens there? Sometimes it's kind of interesting what happens," [...] Moore explained.|$|E
500|$|... "I started [...] at {{different}} charity events where <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> combination of 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero'.

It's been interesting for me, since the events of September 11, the way people have been playing 'Hero' and {{talking to me about}} 'Never Too Far,' 'cause that song is also about loss.

500|$|Many {{critics of}} the time and since have {{declared}} it Cagney's best film, drawing parallels between Cohan and Cagney; they both began their careers in vaudeville, struggled for years before reaching the peak of their profession, were surrounded with family and married early, and both had a wife who was happy to sit back while he went on to stardom. The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won three, including Cagney's for Best Actor. In his acceptance speech, Cagney said, [...] "I've always maintained that in this business, you're {{only as good as the}} other fellow thinks you are. It's nice to know that you people thought <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> good job. And don't forget that it was a good part, too." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Digital Spy, Gray said of her character's persona: I never {{wanted her to be}} boring. She was never boring before–she started out kind of boring, but I think that's the kiss of death because people will expect her to be interesting. By interesting, that doesn't mean she's drunk. I had {{to do a lot of}} thinking about what we would do with her. Where would she be now? <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> lot of homework finding out where she would be and what Texas women are like now. What has she gone through in her life? What has she come to grips with? What does she like about herself? What doesn't she like about herself? What kind of impact is she going to make on her life, on John Ross's life, on her future? Who is she? ...|$|E
