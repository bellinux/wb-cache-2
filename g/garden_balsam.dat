500|$|Typhoon Pongsona was {{the last}} typhoon of the 2002 Pacific typhoon season, and was the second costliest United States {{disaster}} in 2002, only behind Hurricane Lili. The name [...] "Pongsona" [...] was contributed by North Korea for the Pacific tropical cyclone list and is the Korean name for the <b>garden</b> <b>balsam.</b> Pongsona developed out of an area of disturbed weather on December 2, and steadily intensified to reach typhoon status on December 5. On December 8 it passed through Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands while near its peak winds of 175km/h (110mph 10-min). It ultimately turned to the northeast, weakened, and became extratropical on December 11.|$|E

50|$|The name Noul {{has been}} used to name three {{tropical}} cyclones in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The name was contributed by North Korea and it means glowing or sunset. This name replaced Pongsona after 2002 Pacific typhoon season and it means for <b>garden</b> <b>balsam.</b>|$|E
50|$|Hong Nan-pa (April 10, 1897 or 98 - August 30, 1941) was a Korean {{composer}}, violinist, conductor, {{music critic}} and educator. He {{is best known}} as the composer of Bongseonhwa (봉선화, literally <b>Garden</b> <b>Balsam)</b> written in 1919. It is generally considered as the first true Korean original song composed in Western style. It was widely sung during the period. Hong also contributed to developing Korean culture during the period with his diverse cultural activities.|$|E

50|$|A {{third of}} the total Songpa area is green zone: 10.98k㎡ or 32.4% of Songpa area is green zone, the highest rate among {{municipal}} districts in Seoul. Songpa District has as many as 140 parks, also the largest number in Seoul.Each park has its own theme like a flower or a plant reflected by residents' opinion. The theme of Geon-neomal Park in Garak-dong is a rose, while Baekto Park is a wild flower park. The theme of Macheon Park is a royal azalea and Jamsil Park's main theme is aquatic plant. In these parks, diverse flower festivals and events including Royal Azalea Festival, Rose Festival, <b>Garden</b> <b>Balsam</b> Dyeing Festival, Eco Culture Class, Wild Plants Operation and Aquatic Plant Exhibition are held every year.|$|E
40|$|Impatiens balsamina L. is {{well known}} as <b>garden</b> <b>balsam</b> that flowers are very usefull. The flowers can be {{arranged}} in coconut leaves for praying or as a decoration in pots. <b>Garden</b> <b>balsam</b> plants are tall. The flowers are easy to decay especially in rainy season. Vigorous plants with bigger flower for potted plant can be produced by using oryzalin through seedlings treatment of <b>garden</b> <b>balsam.</b> Seedlings were treated in oryzalin at concentrations of 0, 0. 01, 0. 02 and 0. 03 % for 0, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours, then grown in the field. As a result, for M 1 generation, interaction between oryzalin concentration and incubation time was significant for plant height, number of branch and flower weight. Plants height decreased about 54 % for treatment of 0. 01 % oryzalin in 48 h incubation. Oryzalin application also increased the weight of flower. In the next generation (M 3), mixoploid plants were obtained from treatment 0. 02 % oryzalin for 12 h incubation. Based on this study, oryzalin {{can be used for}} producing compact potted plant...|$|E
40|$|Several {{parameters}} {{influenced the}} regeneration process {{such as the}} source of explants was investigated in Impatiens balsamina shoot regenerative system. In the plant tissue culture study of <b>Garden</b> <b>Balsam,</b> I. balsamina, cotyledon was used {{as the source of}} explants. Several parameters including the effect of age, section and hormones on shoot and root induction were observed. The cotyledons from in vitro seedling were harvested at different ages of 7, 14 and 21 days with proximal and distal sections. The present study showed that proximal sections from 7 days old seedling in 1 mg/L BAP showed high percentage of shoot production (88 %) compared to 14 (86 %) and 21 (81 %) days old seedlings. The use of distal sections showed formation of callus for all explant ages. Comparison of different hormones concentrations used on shoot induction showed the optimal shoot formation was on MS media with 1 mg/L BAP. For root induction, explants cultured on half strength MS media containing 0. 1 mg/L IAA induced the highest rooting percentage (92 %). The in vitro plantlets were obtained on free-hormone media at a range of 7 to 10 weeks...|$|E
40|$|<b>Garden</b> <b>balsam,</b> Impatiens balsamina, {{is one of}} an {{important}} ornamental plant in Malaysia. An effort to develop a reliable tissue culture system for this Impatiens species was carried out for future genetic manipulation of this plant for useful traits. Parts of cotyledons and hypocotyl derived from different age of seedlings, from surface sterilized seeds, were subjected to shoot induction on MS media containing BAP, TDZ or combination of BAP and NAA in different ratios. Roots were developed from the above shoots on full- or halfstrength MS media containing IAA, IBA or NAA of different concentrations. Finally fully-developed plantlets were produced on hormone free MS media or full- or half-strength MS media containing specific hormones. It was observed that the most efficient shoot induction (93 %) was obtained from proximal part of cotyledon derived from 7 days old seedlings on MS media supplemented with 1 mg/L BAP. Roots were most efficiently produced (92 %), in term of percentage and morphology, on half-strength MS media supplemented with 0. 1 mg/L IAA. Further regeneration of plantlets, approximately 8 - 10 cm in height, was achieved after 3 weeks on hormone-free MS media. Finally, full regeneration system of Impatiens balsamina was developed, using MS media supplemented with 1 mg/L BAP for shoot and 0. 1 mg/L IAA for roots, within 8 weeks in culture...|$|E
