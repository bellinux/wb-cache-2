5|$|The company {{reported}} a A$64 million loss in its 2008 financial year. By 2009, {{the global economic}} downturn, and regulatory uncertainty associated with MIS schemes, was putting the company under financial pressure, and it was seeking to improve its situation both through asset sales and refinancing of debt. Its debt levels had risen significantly: it had extended its debt financing with its banks from A$245million to A$350million in 2007. By September 2008 its total debt had ballooned to A$820million, of which A$376million was owed to its lead bankers, ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, BankWest and Mizuho. Great Southern had also been <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{a rise in the}} price obtained for its woodchips, but was unsuccessful in its 2009 negotiations with Japanese customers.|$|E
5|$|After {{the home}} {{was placed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 1974 (the result of an {{application}} by an Eldon farmer), the owner refurbished the house, installing an indoor bathroom and electricity and restoring the windows and wallpaper. Local politicians believed such work coupled with a new museum and education center could provide a major boost to local tourism—one state senator hoped for as many as 100,000 visitors per year. After the house's owner eventually turned over the property to the State Historical Society of Iowa in 1991, an effort was made to move the house to Living History Farms outside Des Moines, but Eldonians fought to keep it within their city limits. The house was renovated in 1992, with boosters <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the house become a pop-culture tourism attraction, much like the Field of Dreams site in similarly rural Dyersville. Today the American Gothic House Center hosts approximately 15,000 visitors per year, which does not account for additional after-hours visitors.|$|E
5|$|In 1738, Zahir's forces {{captured}} the fortress at Jiddin and the villages in its political orbit, Abu Snan and Tarshiha. Jiddin had been ruled by Ahmad al-Husayn, whose family historically controlled it. The peasants under his rule {{complained that he}} governed oppressively and appealed to Zahir, who was known for treating the peasantry fairly, to relieve them of al-Husayn. Zahir, eager to expand his control toward the Mediterranean, accepted their requests and obtained permission from the governor of Sidon, Ibrahim Pasha al-Azm, to seize the fortress. Likewise, al-Husayn had also approached the governor, who, <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> two powerful local leaders weakened, gave al-Husayn his blessing as well. Zahir assembled a 1,500-strong force and defeated al-Husayn's forces near the fortress. He was then appointed multazim of Jiddin's subdistrict.|$|E

5|$|Kikai {{had started}} his Asakusa series of square, {{monochrome}} portraits {{as early as}} 1973, but after this there was a hiatus until 1985, {{when he realized that}} an ideal backdrop would be the plain red walls of Sensō-ji. At that time, the great majority of his Asakusa portraits adopted further constraints: the single subject stands {{directly in front of the}} camera (originally a Minolta Autocord TLR, later the Hasselblad), looking directly at it, and is shown from around the knees upwards. Kikai may wait at the temple for four or five hours, <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> somebody he wants to photograph, and three or four days may pass without a single photograph; but he may photograph three people in a single day, and he has photographed over six hundred people in this way. He believes that to have a plain backdrop and a direct confrontation with the subject allows the viewer to see the subject as a whole, and as somebody on whom time is marked, without any distracting or limiting specificity.|$|E

25|$|German {{reaction}} to the French Revolution was mixed at first. German intellectuals celebrated the outbreak, <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the triumph of Reason and The Enlightenment. The royal courts in Vienna and Berlin denounced {{the overthrow of the}} king and the threatened spread of notions of liberty, equality, and fraternity. By 1793, the execution of the French king and the onset of the Terror disillusioned the Bildungsbürgertum (educated middle classes). Reformers said the solution was to have faith in the ability of Germans to reform their laws and institutions in peaceful fashion.|$|E

25|$|In April 1917, Lenin {{and other}} communists passed through Stockholm from the exile in Switzerland on their return trip to Russia after the February Revolution. Lenin, who was greeted in Sweden by Otto Grimlund, Ture Nerman, Fredrik Ström and Carl Lindhagen, {{wanted to go}} and visit Höglund in jail. Arrangements were made, but, due other {{meetings}} running over time and the Bolsheviks hurry {{to get back to}} Russia, Lenin's visit to Långholmen had to be cancelled. However, the Bolshevik leader sent a telegram to Höglund wishing him strength and <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him soon again, signed Lenin and Ström.|$|E
25|$|In March 2011, Oz sent imprisoned former Tanzim leader Marwan Barghouti {{a copy of}} {{his book}} A Tale of Love and Darkness in Arabic {{translation}} with his personal dedication in Hebrew: “This story is our story, I hope you read it and understand us as we understand you, <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you outside and in peace, yours, Amos Oz”. The gesture was criticized by members of rightist political parties, among them Likud MK Tzipi Hotovely. Assaf Harofeh Hospital canceled Oz's invitation to give the keynote speech at an awards ceremony for outstanding physicians in the wake of this incident.|$|E
25|$|In 1957, Jelinek paid an {{unexpected}} visit to Prague. He {{had been in}} Vienna and applied for a visa, <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his former acquaintances again. He met with his old friend Miloš Forman, who introduced him to film student Milena Tabolovawhose screenplay had been {{the basis for the}} movie Easy Life (Snadný život). His flight back to the U.S. had a stopover in Munich, during which he called her to propose. Tabolova was considered a dissident and the authorities were not happy with her film. Jelinek asked for help from Jerome Wiesner and Cyrus Eaton, the latter who lobbied Nikita Khrushchev. Following the inauguration of John F. Kennedy, a group of Czech dissidents were allowed to emigrate in January 1961. Thanks to the lobbying, the future Milena Jelinek was one of them.|$|E

25|$|The {{cadre of}} the Army of the Duchy of Warsaw {{was formed by}} the legionnaires of the Polish Legions. In addition, it was filled by older {{soldiers}} from the Army of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, {{who responded to the}} call to arms of Józef Poniatowski, and patriotic youth. In 1808, after the first emergency period was over, and the Duchy felt more secure, those who wished to leave the army were given leave. The army was expanded with large waves of new recruits on the eve of new wars in 1809 and 1812, when the Duchy fought other partitioners, which resulted in an influx of recruits from those territories, <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> their home liberated. The final recruitment phase was that in the fall and winter of 1813, when the Duchy was trying to rally to its own defense in the aftermath of Napoleon's defeat in Russia.|$|E
25|$|Edgartown is {{well known}} as having {{been one of the}} primary ports for the whaling {{industry}} during the 1800s. Ships {{from all over the world}} would dock in its sheltered bay and captains would build grand mansions for their families with ornate top floor rooms called widow's walks, which overlooked the harbor. A myth developed that wives would watch for months from these tiny rooms, <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the sails of ships that would bring their husbands home from the sea. There is little or no evidence that widow's walks were intended or regularly used for this purpose. They were frequently built around the chimney of the residence, thus creating an easy access route to the structure, allowing the residents of the home to pour sand down burning chimneys in the event of a chimney fire in the hopes of preventing the house from burning down.|$|E
25|$|The only Spanish ship in {{the area}} left from the Armada; the 120 ton Bear of Amsterdam had not seen any of her fellow cohorts. Poor {{navigation}} meant that she had missed Milford Haven and landed as far North at Aberdyfi via the Dyfi Estuary on October 26. They landed men ashore but were ambushed by the Merionethshire Militia losing two killed and four captured and retreated back to their ship. The Bear was unable to leave for ten days {{because of a lack}} of wind but at the same time could not be boarded by the militia as there was no suitable boats. An attempt to burn the ship was thwarted by the wind and the Bear of Amsterdam eventually left. She was driven around the Cornish peninsula & swept up the channel by an easterly gale suffering some damage. <b>Hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the Spanish already at Falmouth, the ship was captured not far off from there on November 10 by a waiting English squadron. She was led into Dartmouth with 70 Spaniards taken prisoner, and this being the last ship from the Armada to be captured.|$|E

25|$|They {{settled in}} Timaru, a town just {{along the coast}} from Lyttelton {{populated}} mainly by Cornish immigrants, and James Fitzsimmons established a blacksmith's forge in the town. Once Fitzsimmons had completed his education at the Timaru Main School, he took {{on a range of}} jobs. He wanted to join the crew of the Isabella Ridley, and do some service as a sailor, hoping that it would toughen him up for a career in boxing, but the ship was badly damaged in storms while still docked in Timaru. Instead, he took on a range of jobs; as a butcher's delivery boy, a carriage painter, striker at an iron foundry, and a decorator, before becoming an apprenticeship at his family's blacksmith's forge, with his brother Jarrett. His time working in the blacksmith's forge helped to develop his upper body, particularly his arms and shoulders. During his time working in the blacksmith's forge, there are stories that Fitzsimmons was not averse to fighting quarrelsome, often drunk, customers, and it was suggested that this even boosted business, as customers returned to the forge, <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a fight.|$|E
25|$|An AHL playoff-record {{crowd of}} 20,103 NHL-lockout hockey starved fans filled the seats as the puck dropped that night <b>hoping</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a Philadelphia {{professional}} hockey team win a playoff title on home ice {{for just the}} fifth time in the 78 years since the C-AHL Philadelphia Arrows first played a professional hockey game in the city in 1927. The Phantoms did not disappoint the SRO crowd as they defeated the Wolves handily, 5–2, with center Ben Stafford (who retired after the playoffs {{and is now a}} Lieutenant in US Marine Corps serving in Iraq) collecting the Cup-winning goal. Rookie Jeff Carter's 23 points (12 goals and 11 assists) earned him individual honors as the AHL's top scorer in the playoffs, while Niittymaki won the Jack Butterfield Award as the Calder Cup MVP. After the Phantoms shook hands with the Wolves players at center ice, AHL President Dave Andrews handed the Calder Cup to team captain Boyd Kane, who skated it around the ice. Ironically, exactly seven years earlier to the day, Phantoms Head Coach John Stevens had received the same Cup from the same hands a few hundred yards away at the Spectrum as captain of the 1997–98 Phantoms. The Phantoms' victory was just the fifth time that a professional hockey title in any league had been won in a game taking place in Philadelphia since the sport was first played in the city in 1927.|$|E
