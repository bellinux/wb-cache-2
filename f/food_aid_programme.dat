40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the main determinants of dependency on <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> <b>programmes.</b> <b>Food</b> <b>aid</b> may take the form of a loan, a sale below market price or a current transfer. <b>Food</b> <b>aid</b> <b>programmes</b> across the globe are generally designed to provide short-term assistance to countries. However, many countries have developed a dependence on <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> assistance. Design/methodology/approach – The paper estimates cross-sectional regressions using a database containing 116 developing countries over the period 1970 - 2003. Bayesian averaging of classical estimates is employed to identify the robust determinants of dependency. Findings – The study finds that the top two determinants of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> dependence (both cereals and non-cereals) were food production and the frequency of droughts affecting the country. Food inflation, population density, crop yields, the amount of arable land per capita, the rule of law and the number of armed conflicts were also robustly related to aid dependence. Practical implications – These findings suggest that international donors should focus primarily on offsetting the substitution effect of aid on local production as well as implement systems to partially offset the negative effects of droughts, if they are to break the cycle of dependence on <b>food</b> <b>aid.</b> Originality/value – Previous studies have investigated the effects of a large number of other variables. The findings from these papers were somewhat conflicting due to differences in model specification. To identify the variables that have a robust relationship with <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> dependence, whatever the model specification, the Bayesian averaging of classical estimates approach proposed by Sala-i-Martin et al. is employed.

40|$|The {{formation}} of a Government of National Unity (GNU) in Zimbabwe in 2009 has generally been assessed as a façade, with ZANU-PF retaining real power to serve its own ends. Whilst {{this may have been}} true of the key challenges facing Zimbabwe – ensuring democratic political competition and the rule of law, and (less clearly) economic stabilisation and growth – it was not true in all areas of public policy. With respect to social protection, the partial change of government resulted in significant reform. In the mid- 2000 s, social protection in Zimbabwe was for the most part limited to donor-funded and distributed emergency <b>food</b> <b>aid.</b> Under the GNU, ministers from the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) presided over more programmatic responses involving the state and donors working together, including on the country’s first sustained experiments with cash transfers as well as innovative <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> <b>programmes.</b> The shift in policy was not due so much to clear policy preferences {{on the part of the}} MDC as to the transformed relations between MDC-controlled government ministries and donors and international agencies. The MDC opened the policy reform door to donors and agencies that were enthusiastic about cash transfer and reformed <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> <b>programmes.</b> The shift to cash transfers was also made possible by dollarisation and market liberalisation.

Setting: Consultations to WFP Ethiopia. Results: Food availability was severely restricted due to recurrent disasters such as drought, flood, war and a lack of diversity of food items.

40|$|Ethiopia has {{experienced}} {{more than five}} major droughts {{in the past three}} decades, leading to high dependency on international food aids. Nevertheless, studies indicate that asset depletion has not been prevented; neither did food insecurity diminish. Since 2004 / 5, the Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) has been implemented to improve food security in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia. Critics point out that the implementation of food aid programmes can have negative impacts as well as positive outcomes for local communities. Accordingly, this survey study aimed to analyse the distribution and allocation of food aids in the Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP) in Tigray. Results of 479 interviews revealed that targeting different households in the PSNP has been considerably linked to socio-demographic attributes among which age and size of family were decisive factors to receive food aids. Furthermore, older households with smaller family size received more direct support. Inequality between genders was another major finding of this study. When combined with the marital status, there was also a big difference in the percentage of married or unmarried women receiving food aids. These findings could provide fundamental information for policy intervention to correct food security programmes at household level and reduce hunger.

40|$|Thesis (MA (Public and Development Management)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. Chronic food {{insecurity}} {{continues to be}} a major problem for rural poor households in Lesotho. This condition is caused by a number of factors including poverty, landlessness, and extreme land degradation, reduced remittances due to retrenchments from South African mines, closures of some of textile industries, the effects of HIV/AIDS and a significant decline in farming practices due to erratic weather patterns and conditions. All these factors have led to an increase in vulnerability levels. This is magnified by the rapid erosion of traditional coping mechanisms, a situation that has consequently left communities unable to respond to any form of disaster. The primary aim of this research was to investigate the community vulnerability to {{food insecurity}} in the Southern Lowlands and review the World Food Programme (WFP) <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> <b>programme</b> in the same area. The research addressed the questions such as the causes of food insecurity in the Southern Lowlands; and social protection initiatives that are being implemented by WFP to address food insecurity. The research revealed that WFP has been distributing food aid to the vulnerable households in the Southern Lowlands since 2002. These households belong to categories such as households hosting orphans and vulnerable children, chronically ill persons and physically disabled persons; female-headed households; elderly-headed households; child-headed households; and expectant and nursing mothers. In addition to these categories, WFP implemented food for work activities in which vulnerable households with able-bodied persons worked in to receive food aid. The research found evidence of chronic livelihood failure in the Southern Lowlands. This failure renders it increasingly difficult for households vulnerable to food insecurity to develop and maintain sustainable livelihoods. In particular, the research revealed that, a large proportion of households (53 %) are at risk of food insecurity in the Southern Lowlands; the majority of vulnerable households did not hold any cereal stocks remaining from the immediate post harvest period; chronic illness, unemployment and erratic weather patterns are causes of food insecurity in the Southern Lowlands. As means of coping strategies, most households adopt various strategies such as switching expenditure patterns; reducing number of meals per day; kingship support; selling of livestock; and searching for casual labour opportunities. Food aid has improved the livelihoods and quality of life of the beneficiaries especially the chronically ill people. While some food for work activities such as building of toilets and water taps have been very helpful, others such as tree planting were not embraced by some of the beneficiaries and finally food aid promotes dependency among its beneficiaries and nursing mothers intentionally starve their children in order to stay in the programme. The two significant challenges in the distribution of food aid were found to be food pipeline break and the beneficiary selection criteria. The findings therefore generate the conclusion that although {{there seems to be an}} improvement in food access by households benefiting from the <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> <b>programme,</b> there is no evidence that those households will continue to access food in the absence of food aid. In essence, the absence of social food security foundation, executed in tandem with food aid interventionist measures, does not realistically augur well for the future. This conclusion comes from the finding that food for work activities which are more likely to generate income for the vulnerable households are not sustainable because the discussions further revealed that these activities have been imposed on the beneficiaries, without the coownership corollary that partners the communities with food aid agencies such as WFP. It is therefore recommended that development agents should not determine the developmental projects/programmes within the communities. The process should be interactive and should not be done in isolation but in mutual social learning and capacity building process as both parties (development agents and the beneficiaries) learn from each other and manage to develop a reciprocal relationship and partnership that will eventually reap sustainable outcome. It is therefore concluded that, the food aid programmes failed to offer sustainable social safety nets to the beneficiaries. The research hypothesis that there is no clear exit strategy in the implementation of the food security interventions and that there are no sustainability and continuity measures that were put into place by WFP remains valid...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Globally, {{one-third of}} food {{production}} is lost annually due to negligent authorities. India alone loses some 21 million tonnes of wheat per year even {{while it has}} 200 million food-insecure people in the nation. Disturbingly provocative as it may sound, it is amazing how national and international institutions and governments make use of human hunger for their own survival (Raghib 2013). The global food system is increasingly insecure. Challenges to long-term global food security are encapsulated by resource scarcity, environmental degradation, biodiversity loss, climate change, reductions of farm labour and a growing world population. These issues are caused and aggravated by the spread of corporatised and monopolised food systems, dietary change, and urbanisation. These factors have rapidly brought food insecurity {{under the umbrella of}} unconventional security threats (Heukelom 2011). For some, humanitarian crises associated with food insecurity, or what has been dubbed ‘the silent tsunami’, is a pending peril, notably for the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people. For others, the food production industry is an emerging market with unprecedented profits. Despite this problem of food scarcity we are witnessing extraordinary ‘food wastage’, notably in North America and Europe, on a scale that would reportedly be capable of feeding the world’s hungry six times over (Stuart 2012). As the opening quotation to this chapter suggests, governments and corporations are deeply involved in the contexts, politics, and resources associated with food related issues. As many economically developed and advanced industrial nations are reporting a rise out of recession, announcements are made by the world’s richest countries that they are to cut US 2 billion per year from food aid. The head of the World <b>Food</b> <b>Aid</b> <b>Programme,</b> Rosette Sheeran, warns that such cuts could result in ‘the loss of a generation’ (Walters 2011). The global food crisis has also reinvigorated debates about agricultural development and genetically modified (GM) food; as well as fuelling debates about poverty, debt and security. This chapter provides a discussion of the political economy of global food debates and explores the threats and opportunities surrounding food production and future food security...|$|E
40|$|Background: Nutrition-related disorders, {{including}} vitamin A deficiency (VAD) {{and chronic}} diseases, are serious {{problems in the}} Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). Many suggest that these disorders are new problems related to dietary and lifestyle changes. In the past four decades, imported foods, such as white rice, flour, sugar, refined foods and fatty meats, have increasingly replaced local foods in the diet. Aim: A literature review was conducted to understand underlying issues related to dietary change and obtain insights for nutrition research and interventions. Method: Published and unpublished papers from different disciplines were reviewed and collated for information on food and nutrition in FSM. Topics covered were historical background, local foods, infant and child feeding, dietary assessment, and nutritional status. Particular focus was on information and data relating to VAD, the primary topic {{that led to the}} review of the literature. Conclusions: FSM, a tropical country of abundant agricultural resources, has suffered a great loss in production and consumption of local foods. Inconsistent external and internal government policies and <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> <b>programmes</b> have contributed to the problem. Further research on the nutrient content of local foods and factors affecting production, acquisition and consumption is needed, as well as a broad, well-planned, intersectoral intervention aimed at dietary improvement for all age groups in the population...|$|R

Iron intake was only 50 - 57 % of the RDAforthe 1 - 3 age group, and 35. 6 % and 32. 0 % of all children consumed < 6 0 % of the RDA for iron in 1986 and 1991, respectively. Main sources of protein were dairy products, milk and eggs. The lower nutrient intake in 1991 compared to 1986 was negatively related to social class.

30|$|Wealth {{differences}} in grazing access exist {{at home as}} well. Herders in Tiamamut have greater access to watering places for their stock, meaning their overall travel time to water is shorter, leaving more time for grazing. Increased grazing time means healthier livestock, a higher market value, and more favourable terms of trade in the market {{when they go to}} sell. Herders in Ilmotiok travel longer distances to water, since their only major water point is the river on the western side of the ranch. Herders in Ilmotiok also travel longer herding radii to complete their grazing path, meaning the long treks to water reduce the amount of grazing they can access. Herders must stay out longer and move greater distances to achieve the same level of grazing. This limits poorer households, whose herd sizes are much smaller anyway, to reduced herd growth, lower market value, and decreased terms of trade in the market. This leads poor families to be dependent on social welfare programmes to feed their families, since neither milk production at home nor livestock sales alone can sustain these families. Poor families must access <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> <b>programmes,</b> supplemental feeding programmes, or other social programmes to maintain their families when internal social structures breakdown. While rich families can use cash and smart herd growth to improve their livelihoods after drought, poor families will continue to be dependent on external aid for survival.|$|R
40|$|Background: Tete Province, Mozambique has {{experienced}} chronic food insecurity and a dramatic fall in livestock numbers {{due to the}} cyclic problems characterized by the floods in 2000 and severe droughts in 2002 and 2003. The Province has been a beneficiary of emergency relief programs, which have assisted > 22 % of the population. However, these programs were not based on sound epidemiological data, {{and they have not}} established baseline data against which {{to assess the impact of}} the programs. Objective: The objective of this study was to document mortality rates, causes of death, the prevalence of malnutrition, and the prevalence of lost pregnancies after 2. 5 years of humanitarian response to the crisis. Methods: A two-stage, 30 -cluster household survey was conducted in the Cahora Bassa and Changara districts from 22 October to 08 November 2004. A total of 838 households were surveyed, with a population size of 4, 688 people. Results: Anthropometric data were collected among children 6 - 59 months of age. In addition, crude mortality rates (CMRs), under five mortality rates (U 5 MRs), causes of deaths, and prevalence of lost pregnancies were determined among the sample population. The prevalence of malnutrition was 8. 0 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) = 6. 2 - 9. 8 %) for acute malnutrition, 26. 9 % (95 % CI= 24. 0 - 29. 9 %) for being underweight, and 37. 0 % (95 % CI= 33. 8 - 40. 2 %) for chronic malnutrition. Boys were more likely to be underweight than were girls (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 34; 95 % CI= 1. 00, 1. 82; p< 0. 05) after controlling for age, household size, and food aid beneficiary status. Similarly, children 30 - 59 months of age were significantly less likely to suffer from acute malnutrition (OR= 0. 45; 95 % CI= 0. 26, 0. 79; p< 0. 01) and less likely to be underweight (OR= 0. 37; 95 % CI= 0. 27, 0. 51; p< 0. 01) than children 6 - 29 months of age, after adjusting for the other, aforementioned factors. The proportion of lost pregnancies was estimated at 7. 7 % (95 % CI= 4. 5 - 11. 0 %). A total of 215 deaths were reported during the year preceding the survey. Thirty-nine (18. 1 %) children < 5 years of age died. The CMR was 1. 23 / 10 000 /day (95 % CI= 1. 08 - 1. 38), and an U 5 MR was 1. 03 / 10 000 /day (95 % CI= 0. 71 - 1. 35). Diarrheal diseases, malaria, tuberculosis, and human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) accounted for more than two-thirds of all deaths. Conclusions: The observed CMR in Tete Province, Mozambique is three times higher than the baseline rate for sub-Saharan Africa and 1. 4 times higher than the CMR cut-off point used to define excess mortality in emergencies. The current humanitarian response in Tete Province would benefit from an improved alignment of food aid programming in conjunction with diarrheal disease control, HIV/AIDS, and malaria prevention and treatment programs. The impact of the food programs would be improved if mutually acceptable <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> <b>programme</b> objectives, verifiable indicators relevant to each objective, and beneficiary targets and selection criteria are developed.

Secondly, the results suggest, overall, that project <b>aid</b> flows and <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> (excluding emergency and relief <b>food</b> <b>aid)</b> are associated with a reduction domestic savings. By contrast, financial <b>programme</b> <b>aid</b> and technical assistance grants do not appear to reduce domestic savings...|$|R
40|$|The paper uses an aid {{disaggregation}} {{approach to}} {{examine the impact of}} different aid modalities on the fiscal sector of the aid-recipient country. It uses time-series data on different types of development <b>aid</b> (project <b>aid,</b> <b>programme</b> <b>aid,</b> technical assistance and <b>food</b> <b>aid)</b> for Uganda, an important aid recipient in recent years, to estimate a model of fiscal response in the presence of aid which combines aid heterogeneity and endogenous aid. The empirical findings clearly suggest the importance of the above approach for delving deeper into aid effectiveness issues since different aid categories have different effects on key fiscal variables-an impact that could not be revealed if a single figure for aid were employed. Project and <b>food</b> <b>aids</b> appear to cause a reduction in public investment whereas <b>programme</b> <b>aid</b> and technical assistance are positively related to public investment. The same applies for government consumption. A negligible impact on government tax and non-tax revenues, and a strong displacement of government borrowing are also found.

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} fiscal {{response}} framework {{to investigate the}} extent to which different categories of foreign aid flows, namely project <b>aid,</b> <b>programme</b> <b>aid,</b> technical assistance and <b>food</b> <b>aid,</b> displace public savings and affect the recipient country's dependence on aid, using time series data for Cote d'Ivoire for the period 1975 - 99. The results indicate that, in general, project aid flows tend to reduce public savings and worsen Cote d'Ivoire's dependence on aid more than the other categories of aid flows. This finding therefore suggests that accounting for aid heterogeneity in aid studies as well as aid policies design and implementation could be crucial in improving aid effectiveness to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the empirics of aid and growth by investigating whether aid modality matters in explaining its effectiveness. For this purpose, we include the four main aid modalities (project <b>aid,</b> financial <b>programme</b> <b>aid,</b> technical assistance grants and <b>food</b> <b>aid)</b> as explanatory variables in an endogenous growth model. Using the GMM-SYS approach to dynamic panel estimator we test the three main competing specifications in the aid and growth literature for a sample of aid recipient countries over the 1974 - 2001 period. We find that project aid exerts a positive and significant impact on growth, thus casting doubt on the so-called “micromacro paradox”. Our results also show that financial <b>programme</b> <b>aid</b> generally impacts on growth negatively, while the impact of non-financial aid, technical assistance grants and <b>food</b> <b>aid,</b> is statistically insignificant. We found, however, no {{evidence to suggest that}} policy enhances the growth effect of the aid categories. Our non-linearity tests suggest that only project aid is associated with diminishing returns. Finally, our results confirm the finding that climate related conditions affect the working of aid (project) ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{develops}} {{a model of}} public fiscal behaviour of the aid-recipient government {{in the presence of}} both endogenous and heterogeneous foreign aid. We endogenize aid {{on the grounds that the}} recipient government has some influence over aid disbursements. Regarding aid hetero-geneity, it is argued that each of the main four categories of aid, namely project <b>aid,</b> <b>programme</b> <b>aid,</b> technical assistance and <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> may exert different effects on the recipient economy. Furthermore, in case the preferences of the aid-recipient government are higher for some of these types of aid, neglecting aid heterogeneity would lead to aggregation bias in the results and conclusions. The model adds an important new dimension to the vast aid effectiveness literature and calls for further modelling as well as empirical work in this promising research area so that significant policy impli-cations can be derived...|$|R
40|$|Summary <b>Food</b> <b>aid</b> {{dependency}} among Ethiopian farmers frequently {{is claimed}} with serious policy impacts. This article explores this assertion {{with reference to}} South Wollo, Ethiopia, one of the country's largest recipients of <b>food</b> <b>aid.</b> It uses household economic and ethnographic data from the 1999 - 2000 and 2002 - 03 droughts when <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> imports were very high. By examining patterns of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> distribution and resource allocation among groups of <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> recipients and non-recipients, the article suggests that <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> has not encouraged dependency-like behaviors. It suggests that few farmers would be foolhardy enough to significantly alter their actions, since <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> delivery is too uncertain and poorly timed. ...|$|R

Introduction: More {{than half}} a million {{children}} worldwide die from the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) each year. In Uganda, HIV/AIDS is a major cause of infant and childhood mortality. Although the government of Uganda, through various strategies, has increased access to antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), resulting in national scaling up of accessibility to antiretroviral therapy (ART), initiation of ART in resource-limited areas remains a challenge due to constraints such as the absence of or limited number of CD 4 machines and related laboratory constraints. Further scaling up of ART for children would be greatly strengthened by increased access to laboratory services for CD 4 counts or the introduction of alternative indicators or guidelines for the initiation of ART. Aim: This study therefore set out to investigate, through the analysis of retrospectively collected data, whether anthropometric indices (wasting - weight for height; underweight - weight for age; and stunting - height for age) could provide a useful alternative guide when deciding about initiation of ART in children aged 2 - 12 years in the absence of sophisticated clinical and laboratory support. Methods: The study was conducted at the Mildmay Centre, an HIV/AIDS specialist centre located in Kampala, Uganda. Parameters such as the age at which children had been initiated onto ART, duration on ART, World Health Organisation (WHO) and Centre for Disease Control (CDC) disease stages at time of initiation, anthropometry at time of initiation, CD 4 % staging at time of initiation, support received from <b>food</b> <b>aid</b> <b>programmes,</b> referral to other health centres as a result of malnutrition and care-giver nutrition education/counselling were all determined retrospectively from clinical records. Results: It was found, based on CDC (2000) growth reference charts, that {{of the total number of}} children who took part in this study (N= 125), 98. 4 % were mildly wasted, 52. 8 % mildly underweight and 75. 2 % mildly stunted when they were initiated onto ART. Of the children, who had WHO disease staging documented - 40 % (N= 50), the majority - 86 % (N= 43) were in WHO disease staging II and III during initiation of ART. and 96 % (N= 48) were mildly wasted. However, the relationship between WHO disease staging and wasting, underweight, and stunting at initiation of ART in children at the Mildmay centre was not significant. The relationship between CD 4 % and underweight or stunted children was also not significant. It was established however, that in the absence of CD 4 laboratory parameters (since CD 4 % is vital in the initiation of ART in children) as is the case in resource limited areas, anthropometric indices (moderate to severe wasting, weight for height -W/H) could be used concurrently with CDC and WHO disease staging to initiate ART in children. However, it is important to note that anthropometric indices on their own cannot be used as a guide for initiating ART in children. Conclusion: Anthropometric status alone cannot be used to accurately determine when to initiate ART in children 2 - 12 years...|$|R
