25|$|In 1963, <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> a Jewish {{school in}} Dublin, {{teaching}} French with an Irish accent to kids, primarily Lithuanians. The parents there {{gave me a}} trip to Israel as a present. I had no money, so I went and worked in a kibbutz – plucking chickens, picking oranges. My parents were very nervous; here I was {{going out to the}} Middle East by myself. I wrote to them regularly, telling them about the kibbutz. My father and mother sent my letters to a newspaper, which published them. So I thought, It's not so hard to be a writer. Just write a letter home. After that, I started writing other travel articles.|$|E
500|$|The BBC Foreign Affairs Editor John Simpson {{encountered}} similar difficulties on {{the issue}} of censorship while reporting from Iraq during the Gulf War in 1990–91. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> Baghdad, officials there always used to mention our Sinn Féin ban if you criticised their censorship. I don't like to see this country appearing {{on the same side of}} the dividing line as Saddam Hussein on anything at all." [...] At a conference on the reporting of Northern Ireland-related issues at the University of London in November 1993, chaired by the Irish journalist Mary Holland, several participants claimed it was undermining the practice of investigative reporting.|$|E
500|$|Records {{are unclear}} on exactly when Vázquez {{began to work}} as a luchador or {{professional}} wrestler, but it is known he started out in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua working for local lucha libre promoter Carlos [...] "Gorila" [...] Ramos under the name [...] "El Torbellino Vázquez" [...] ("Whirlwind Vázquez"). In the late 1950s Ramos decided to give Vázquez a new ring character, creating the enmascarado, or masked wrestler, character El Espanto ("the Terror" [...] or [...] "The Horror"). As El Espanto he would wear an all black and white ring gear, including a black mask with a broad, white cross {{on the front of the}} mask. A few months later Cisnero was given the character [...] "Espanto II" [...] (with Vázquez becoming [...] "Espanto I") and thus the team of Los Hermano Espantos ("The Terror brothers") or Los Espantos was created. Ramos recommended Espanto I to the Mexico City promoters of Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre ("Mexican Wrestling Enterprise"; EMLL) where he made his EMLL debut on December 16, 1959 in EMLL's Arena Coliseo. While Espanto <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> Mexico City, Espanto II was gaining more experience locally before being called up to Mexico City as well.|$|E

500|$|When Tisdale was twelve, {{she sang}} for then-President Bill Clinton during an {{event at the}} White House {{as part of a}} troupe. Hoping to expand her career, Tisdale and her family moved to Los Angeles, California. She landed her first role in 1997, guest {{starring}} on an episode of both Smart Guy and 7th Heaven. During this time, she also began doing modeling work for Ford Models. The following year, Tisdale appeared as a voice actor in both An All Dogs Christmas Carol (1998) and A Bug's Life (1998). She guest starred in an episode of Boston Public in 2000, earning a 2000 Young Artist Award nomination for [...] "Best Guest Performance in a TV Drama". Tisdale continued to make guest appearances on television shows and appear in minor film roles throughout the following years, with roles in films such as Donnie Darko (2001) and The Mayor of Oyster Bay (2002). During this time, Tisdale continued to work and attend school, stating [...] "I was always in regular school and <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> clothing stores growing up. I didn't 'make it' until I was 18, so I had already graduated public school. I definitely feel like I had the best of both worlds." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Anderson's account, {{the first}} of the stories that became Winesburg, Ohio ({{probably}} [...] "The Book of the Grotesque") was composed, {{on the spur of the}} moment, in the middle of the night, probably while he was staying on the third floor of a rooming house at [...] in Chicago: [...] "...it was a late fall night and raining...I was there naked in the bed and I sprang up. I went to my typewriter and began to write. It was there, under those circumstances, myself sitting near an open window, the rain occasionally blowing in and wetting my bare back, that I did my first writing...I wrote it, as I wrote them all, complete in the one sitting...The rest of the stories in the book came out of me on succeeding evenings, and sometimes during the day while <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> the advertising office..." [...] Study of his manuscripts shows that, though it is probably true that most of the stories were written within a relatively short span of time in late 1915, like a number of facts in Anderson's retelling of his writing process (for instance, his claim that he had written the Winesburg, Ohio stories after his earlier books were already published), it is inaccurate to say that the final versions of the stories published in 1919 were exactly the same as the ones written whole four years earlier.|$|E

Los Hermanos Espanto made their debut as a team on January 24, 1961, winning [...] a tag team tournament in their debut by defeating Tony López and Kiko Córcega in the finals. As a team they would remain undefeated for 34 weeks in a row on EMLL's regular Tuesday night show. Due to their success and fan reaction Los Espantos soon started working regularly on EMLL's Friday night Super Viernes show, EMLL's main show. During their run as a team they wrestled against Lou Thez, the visiting NWA World Heavyweight Champion, with Thez teaming up with Blue Demon on one occasion and Huracán Ramírez on another.|$|E

2500|$|McLure {{says that}} he was {{inspired}} to write the play by a vision that came to him of a poster advertising a boxing match between Jean Harlow and Billy the Kid. Before he began to write, {{he went to the}} printer that created boxing posters in San Francisco, and had the poster of his vision printed up. Then he says [...] "I put the poster up on fences, windows, and in liquor stores where boxing posters would be, and put one up behind my head in the room <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> at the time, which overlooked the bridge and the ocean. I could feel the presence of Billy the Kid and Jean Harlow broadcasting from the beautiful poster to {{the back of my head}} out towards the ocean. They began enacting the play and I began typing it up. They'd say a few pages, I just typed it. I thought it was a nature poem about mammal sexuality and mammal love.

2500|$|Seventeen-year-old Florence married Cleo Owens, a 23-year-old farmer's {{son from}} Stone County, Missouri, on February 14, 1921. They soon {{had their first}} daughter, Violet, {{followed}} by a second daughter, Viola, and a son, Leroy. [...] The family migrated west with other Owens' relatives to Oroville, California, where they worked in the saw mills and on the farms of the Sacramento Valley. By 1931, Florence was pregnant with her sixth child when her husband Cleo died of tuberculosis. Florence then worked {{in the fields and}} in restaurants to support her six children. In 1933 Florence had another child, returned to Oklahoma for a time, and then was joined by her parents as they migrated to Shafter, California, north of Bakersfield. There Florence met Jim Hill, with whom she had three more children. During the 1930s the family worked as migrant farm workers following the crops in California and at times into Arizona. Florence later recalled periods when she picked 400–500 pounds of cotton from first daylight until after it was too dark to work. She said: [...] "I worked in hospitals. I tended bar. I cooked. <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> the fields. I done {{a little bit of everything}} to make a living for my kids." ...|$|E
