The Mannich-type reactions between N-acyliminium ions generated from N,O-acetals and nucleophiles have been frequently utilized to introduce substituents at the α-position of various amines. 1, 2 We have already exploited some reactions between N,O-acetals prepared by electrochemical oxidation 3 and various nucleophiles to afford some important α-substituted amines. 4 Those reactions were carried out in large volume of organic solvents {{which seemed to be}} environmentally unsuitable and uneconomical. 5 So we examined solvent-free 6 processes for such reactions, and found that the Mannich-type reaction for N,O-acetals (2 a,b) proceeded though acyliminium ions under solvent-free conditions more efficiently than ones in organic solvents (Eq. 1). We report herein the detail of the results and the comparison with the corresponding reactions carried out using organic solvents. ...|$|R

Cyclohexenone 1 was reacted with <b>dimethyl</b> <b>malonate</b> 2 in an asymmetric Michael reaction using AlLibis(binaphthoxide) to form chiral diester 3. Its ketone group was protected as an acetal (2-ethyl-2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane, TsOH) and a carboxyl group was removed (LiCl, DMSO 140 °C) in monoester 4. A C2 fragment was added as Weinreb amide 5 to form PMB ether 6 using LDA. The ketone was then reduced to the alcohol (NaBH3CN, TiCl4) and then water was eliminated (DCC, CuCl) to form alkene 7. After ester reduction (DIBAL) to the alcohol and its TIPS protection (TIPSOTf, triethylamine), the acetal group was removed (catalytic CSA) in ketone 8. Enone 9 was then formed by Saegusa oxidation.
