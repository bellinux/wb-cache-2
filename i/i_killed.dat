500|$|Four years later, the children's father [...] "came to Stamps without warning" [...] and {{returned}} {{them to their}} mother's care in St. Louis. [...] At the age of eight, while living with her mother, Angelou was sexually abused and raped by her mother's boyfriend, a man named Freeman. She told her brother, who told {{the rest of their}} family. Freeman was found guilty but was jailed for only one day. [...] Four days after his release, he was murdered, probably by Angelou's uncles. [...] Angelou became mute for almost five years, believing, as she stated, [...] "I thought, my voice killed him; <b>I</b> <b>killed</b> that man, because I told his name. [...] And then I thought I would never speak again, because my voice would kill anyone..." [...] According to Marcia Ann Gillespie and her colleagues, who wrote a biography about Angelou, it was during this period of silence when Angelou developed her extraordinary memory, her love for books and literature, and her ability to listen and observe the world around her.|$|E

500|$|Within {{twenty minutes}} of Saldívar's surrender, {{she was taken}} to the {{downtown}} police station in Corpus Christi and placed in an interrogation room with investigators Paul and Ray Rivera. Paul Rivera, who had investigated homicides since 1978, informed Saldívar of her right to an attorney, which she waived. When police investigators surrounded Saldívar's truck, she had cried out, [...] "I can't believe <b>I</b> <b>killed</b> my best friend". Within hours, she was saying the shooting was accidental. Saldívar's bail bond was initially set at $100,000, but District Attorney Carlos Valdez persuaded the presiding judge to raise it to $500,000. When bail was announced, fans asked why the death penalty had not been sought. The Nueces County jail was deluged with death threats and there were public calls for vigilante justice. Some gang members in Texas were reported to have taken up collections to raise the bond for Saldívar so they could kill her when she was released. In prison, she faced more death threats from inmates. The Mexican Mafia, a dominant gang in the Texas penal system, reportedly placed a price on her head and spread the word that anyone who committed the crime would be a hero.|$|E
500|$|Welles's biographer Simon Callow has {{compared}} Falstaff to Welles's father Richard Head Welles, {{stating that}} like Falstaff, Welles's father was [...] "a drunkard, a trickster, a braggart, a womanizer, a gentleman and a charmerand he is {{rejected by the}} person he loves the most." [...] Welles's father was an alcoholic and womanizer who would often take a teenage Welles along {{with him when he}} was indulging in his vices. Welles observed his father much like Falstaff is observed by Hal and depends on his young protégé to bail him out of trouble. The love triangle between Prince Hal and his two father figures, Henry IV and Falstaff, is also similar to Welles's relationships with his father and the two men who became surrogate fathers to him: family friend Dr. Maurice Bernstein and Todd School for Boys headmaster Roger Hill. Both of Welles's surrogate fathers disapproved of Richard Welles's lifestyle and negative influence on Welles. When the younger Welles turned fifteen, he took the advice of Roger Hill and told his father that he would not see him again until he cleaned up his act and stopped drinking; Welles's father died shortly afterwards, alone and lonely, and Welles always blamed himself for his father's death, stating, [...] "I always thought <b>I</b> <b>killed</b> him." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's opening track, [...] "Artificial Energy", {{features}} a prominent horn section and as such, {{can be seen}} as a stylistic relative of [...] "Lady Friend" [...] and [...] "So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star", two earlier Byrds' songs that made use of brass. The song deals with the dark side of amphetamine use and it was Chris Hillman who initially suggested that the band should [...] "write a song about speed". The title was suggested by drummer Michael Clarke, and his input in the creation of the song was sufficient to afford him a rare writing credit. Although the song's lyrics initially seem to be extolling the virtues of amphetamines, the tale turns darker in the final verse when it becomes apparent that the drug taker has been imprisoned for murdering a homosexual man, as evidenced by the song's final couplet: [...] "I'm coming down off amphetamine/And I'm in jail 'cause <b>I</b> <b>killed</b> a queen." [...] Although the press had accused the Byrds of writing songs about drugs in the past, specifically with [...] "Eight Miles High" [...] and [...] "5D (Fifth Dimension)", when the band finally did record a song unequivocally dealing with drugs it was largely ignored by journalists.|$|E

500|$|Rodman {{experienced}} a tough loss when coach Chuck Daly, {{whom he had}} admired as a surrogate father, resigned in May; Rodman skipped the preseason camp and was fined $68,000. The following 1992–1993 season was even more tumultuous. Rodman and Annie Bakes, {{the mother of his}} daughter Alexis, were divorcing after a short marriage, an experience which left him traumatized. The Pistons won only 40games and missed the 1993 NBA Playoffs entirely. One night in February 1993, Rodman was found asleep in his car with a loaded rifle. Four years later in his biography As Bad As I Wanna Be, he confessed having thought about suicide and described that night as an epiphany: [...] "I decided that instead [...] I was gonna kill the impostor that was leading Dennis Rodman to a place he didn't want to go... So I just said, 'I'm going to live my life the way I want to live it and be happy doing it.' At that moment I tamed [...] my whole life around. <b>I</b> <b>killed</b> the person I didn't want to be." [...] The book was later adapted for a TV movie Bad As I Wanna Be: The Dennis Rodman Story. Although he had three years and $11.8million remaining on his contract, Rodman demanded a trade. On October 1, 1993, the Pistons dealt him to the San Antonio Spurs.|$|E
500|$|Frazier {{made his}} sophomore debut on November 7, 2010, in an {{exhibition}} game against East Stroudsburg. He added 10 points, 6 assists, and two steals. Frazier also recorded a team-high 4 turnovers. DeChellis commented, [...] "Offensively we were poor tonight and we had too many turnovers... something we've struggled with in practice." [...] On November 12, 2010, Frazier made his second appearance as a sophomore with 6 points, 7 rebounds, 6 assists, and 1 steal. He shot 1-of-5 on field goals, while going a perfect 4-of-4 from the free-throw line. Frazier was named the game's starting shooting guard and was allowed 30 minutes of playing time. He made his first-ever appearance as Penn State's starting point guard on November 19 vs. Fairfield, and contributed 3 points, 4 rebounds, 7 assists, and 1 steal. The team's coach commented on Frazier's powerful defensive performance, [...] "thought Tim Frazier did a very nice job defensively on the point guard for Fairfield who {{is a really good}} player. He bothered him all night." [...] Frazier made his first impression above the 10-points barrier on January 15, 2011 vs. Ohio State, with 11 points, 6 rebounds, and 5 assists. He shot 4-of-4 from the field and made three of four free throws. On March 12, 2011, Frazier scored 22 points against Michigan State, his season-high as a sophomore, helping the team pull off the upset victory in the semifinals of the 2011 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament. He played in his first NCAA Tournament game against Temple, contributing 15 points, 7 assists, 5 rebounds, and 2 steals. He made a late miscue guarding Juan Fernández, allowing the opposing guard to close out the game with under one second remaining in regulation. Frazier recalled the moment, [...] "I closed out high end so he wouldn't be able to shoot over me. (He) made a great move, pivoted {{a couple of times and}} then stepped through." [...] Fernández said, [...] "I was thinking about shooting a jump shot but <b>I</b> <b>killed</b> my dribble and (Tim) Frazier was right there. For some reason he jumped over to my right and that gave me the space to go left." [...] By the end of the season, Frazier averaged 6.3 points, 5.1 assists, 3.9 rebounds, 1.0 steals, and 0.1 blocks per game. He was named to the Academic All-Big Ten following 2010–11.|$|E
