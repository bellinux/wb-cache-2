5|$|Flies tend {{to fly in}} a {{straight}} line then make a rapid change in direction before continuing on a different straight path. The directional changes are called saccades and typically involve an angle of 90°, being achieved in 50 milliseconds. They are initiated by visual stimuli as the fly observes an object, nerves then activate steering muscles in the thorax that cause a small change in wing stroke which generate sufficient torque to turn. Detecting this within four or five wingbeats, the halteres trigger a counter-turn and the fly heads off <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>direction.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gravity Bone is a {{freeware}} first-person adventure {{video game}} developed by Blendo Games, and released on August 28, 2008.

5|$|Las Casas {{worked there}} in adverse {{conditions}} for the following months, being constantly harassed by the Spanish pearl fishers of Cubagua island who traded slaves for alcohol with the natives. Early in 1522 Las Casas left the settlement to complain to the authorities.

He returned to Hispaniola in January 1522, and heard the news of the massacre. The rumours even included him among the dead.

5|$|The sequel, Xenosaga Episode II, was {{developed}} by a new team with Takahashi overseeing the project so the series could be taken <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>direction</b> by younger staff members within Monolith Soft. The scenario, written by Norihiko Yonesaka based on the initial draft by Takahashi and Saga, ended up leaving {{out a lot of}} the originally planned content. Episode II was released in Japan in June 2004, while it was released in North America in February 2005. The sequel was also published in Europe by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe in October of that year. Both Episode I and Episode II were re-imagined for the Nintendo DS as Xenosaga I & II, released in March 2006. Co-developed by Monolith Soft and Tom Create, the scenario was supervised by Takahashi and included material which needed to be cut from the original releases of the first two Xenosaga games. Xenosaga I & II remains exclusive to Japan.|$|E
5|$|During the {{development}} of the first installment in the series, Square's management decided to manufacture 400,000 copies of the game to make a sequel possible. As there were no concrete ideas for Final Fantasy II from the start, it was eventually taken <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>direction</b> and included none of the previous game's characters or locations. Hironobu Sakaguchi, who had previously served as the main planner for Final Fantasy, assumed the role of director to accommodate for the larger development team. Using the experience gained from the first installment, which focused more on fitting story ideas into their new gameplay system and game world, the developers fully crafted the story of Final Fantasy II first. The gameplay was then built around the narrative. The experience system was designed to be a more realistic advancement system than that of the first game. Several members of the original staff from the first game reprised their jobs for Final Fantasy II. Sakaguchi again created the plot for the title, with the actual scenario written by Kenji Terada. Nobuo Uematsu composed the music, as he had for the first game, while Yoshitaka Amano was again the concept artist. As with the original, Final Fantasy II was programmed by Nasir Gebelli. Midway through {{the development}} of the game, Gebelli was forced to return to Sacramento, California from Japan due to an expired work visa. The rest of the development staff followed him to Sacramento with necessary materials and equipment and finished production of the game there. The game was released one day {{less than a year after}} the first game came out.|$|E

25|$|Spybuck told Harrington that he {{preferred}} painting cowboys, livestock, and range scenes, but through Harrington's patronage, Spybuck's style evolved, particularly in {{his choice of}} subjects {{and the way he}} painted them.

His style recalled Plains flatstyle representative art that often identified individuals by depicting details of dress and accoutrement, but he took the representational depiction of the figures and setting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>direction</b> that was uniquely his own.|$|E
