40|$|The authors {{examine the}} effects of {{multiple}} goals on three different tasks (i. e., two creativity tasks and one intervening task) and the discretion to switch back and forth between tasks on creative performance. They propose that individuals ’ focus of attention and cognitive exhaustion may explain the hypothesized effects on incubation and subsequent creativity. Results demonstrate the highest creativity when individuals have goals for all tasks and discretion to switch between them. The results in part are explained by focus of attention and cognitive exhaustion. The authors dis-cuss how multiple tasks ’ and goals ’ effect on creativity can lead to <b>forced</b> <b>incubation...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{observation}} of influenza A M 2 (M 2) incorporated in a dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) supported planar bilayer on mica, formed by use of a modified vesicle fusion method from proteoliposomes and visualized with contact mode atomic <b>force</b> microscopy. <b>Incubation</b> of proteoliposomes in a hyperosmotic solution and increased DPPC/M 2 weight ratios improved supported planar bilayer formation by M 2 /DPPC proteoliposomes. M 2 's extra-bilayer domains were observed as particles estimated to protrude 1 – 1. 5 nm above the bilayer surface and 6 × 10 − 15 cm 2 /s). Protein-protein interactions were also observed directly...|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} a {{reversible}} permeabilization method to facilitate the entry of Giα 1, 2 and 3 G-protein subunit mRNA antisense or mismatch oligonucleotides into intact tissue, to investigate the G-protein α-subunit coupling of α 2 -adrenoceptors, neuropeptide Y (NPY) Y 1, and A 1 adenosine receptors in preparations of the epididymis of the guinea-pig. The α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist, xylazine, elicited concentration dependent contractions from preparations of phenylephrine (3 [*]μM) -stimulated epididymis (pEC 50 value 6. 52 ± 0. 39, maximum response 236 ± 41 [*]mg force). Compared to respective mismatch controls the incubation of preparations with Giα 2, but not with Giα 1 or Giα 3 mRNA antisense oligonucleotides (30 [*]μM) reduced the maximal xylazine-potentiation of phenylephrine (3 [*]μM) -stimulated contractility (to 51 ± 12 % of Giα 2 mismatch control). The oligonucleotide incubations had no effect upon the pEC 50 values of xylazine. The A 1 adenosine receptor agonist, cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) elicited concentration dependent contractions from preparations of phenylephrine (3 [*]μM) -stimulated epididymis (pEC 50 value 7. 66 ± 0. 57, maximum response 208 ± 54 [*]mg <b>force).</b> <b>Incubation</b> of preparations of epididymis with Giα 1, but neither Giα 2 nor Giα 3 antisense oligonucleotides reduced the maximal CPA-potentiation of phenylephrine (3 [*]μM) -stimulated contractions (to 55 ± 17 % of Giα 1 mismatch control), pEC 50 values were not affected. The incubation of preparations with Giα 2 antisense mRNA oligonucleotides reduced the maximal NPY-potentiation of phenylephrine (3 [*]μM) -stimulated contractions (to 62 ± 15 % of Giα mismatch control). Compared with Giα 2 mismatch controls, the incubation of preparations with Giα 1 and Giα 3 oligonucleotides also reduced the NPY-potentiation of phenylephrine (3 [*]μM) -stimulated contractions. These studies indicate that, in the guinea-pig epididymis, α 2 -adrenoceptors and A 1 adenosine receptors preferentially couple to effectors through Giα 2 and Giα 1 subunits respectively. In contrast NPY receptors may elicit effects through either Giα 1, 2 or 3 subunits...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic actin {{reorganization}} involving actin polymerization and depolymerization {{may play}} an important functional role in smooth muscle. This study tested the hypothesis that F-actin stabilization by phalloidin increases tension cost (i. e. ATP hydrolysis rate per unit of isometric force) during Ca 2 +-induced activation of Triton X- 100 -permeabilized canine tracheal smooth muscle. Adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis rate was quantified using an enzyme-coupled NADH fluorometric technique, regulatory myosin light chain (rMLC) phosphorylation was measured by Western blot analysis, and maximum unloaded shortening velocity (Vmax) was estimated by interpolation of the force-velocity relationship to zero load during isotonic loading. Maximal activation with 10 μm free Ca 2 + induced sustained increases in isometric force, stiffness, and rMLC phosphorylation. However, the increase in ATP hydrolysis rate initially reached peak values, but then declined to steady-state levels above that of the unstimulated muscle. Thus, tension cost decreased throughout steady-state isometric <b>force.</b> Following <b>incubation</b> of permeabilized strips with 50 μm phalloidin for 1 h, the increases in isometric force and stiffness were not sustained despite a sustained increase in rMLC phosphorylation. Also, after an initial decline, tension cost increased throughout activation. Phalloidin {{had no effect on}} Vmax during steady-state isometric force or on rMLC phosphorylation. These findings suggest that dynamic reorganization of actin is necessary for optimal energy utilization during contraction of permeabilized airway smooth muscle...|$|R
40|$|The 24 h {{stability}} of bare silicon wafers as such or silanized with CH 3 O-(CH 2 -CH 2 -O) n -C 3 H 6 -trichlorosilane (n = 6 - 9) {{was investigated in}} water, NaCl, phosphate and carbonate solutions, and in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C (close to biological conditions regarding temperature, high ionic strength, and pH). The resulting surfaces were analyzed using ellipsometry, X-ray Reflectometry (XRR), X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), and Atomic <b>Force</b> Microscopy (AFM). <b>Incubation</b> of the silanized wafers in phosphate solution and PBS provokes a detachment of the silane layer. This {{is due to a}} hydrolysis of Si-O bonds which is favored by the action of phosphate, also responsible for a corrosion of non-silanized wafers. The surface alteration (detachment of silane layer and corrosion of the non-silanized wafer) is also important with carbonate solution, due to a higher pH (8. 3). The protection of the silicon oxide layer brought by silane against the action of the salts is noticeable for phosphate but not for carbonate. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{production}} of {{significant amounts of}} extracellular choleragen and vascular permeability factor (PF) by Vibrio cholerae strain VC- 12 (Ogawa) in a basal peptone medium required <b>forced</b> aeration, low <b>incubation</b> temperature, and a low initial pH. Filtrates of alkaline peptone cultures of VC- 12 grown at 37 C contained an ion translocase inhibitory activity but neither choleragen nor PF activity, Sterile filtrates of pH 6. 5 peptone cultures of VC- 12 grown at 29 C contained no ion translocase inhibitory activity but possessed choleragen activity (lethality for the suckling rabbit) and PF activity {{to the extent that}} the intradermal inoculation of 0. 1 ml of a 1 : 12, 288 dilution of such a filtrate gave rise to a vascular permeability reaction (8 by 8 mm in diameter) in the guinea pig. PF excretion occurred during the late logarithmic phase of growth but did not appear to be the consequence of cell lysis. The PF activities of strains VC- 12 and 569 B (Inaba) were neutralized to the same extent by anticholeragen antiserum prepared against crude 569 B choleragen...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} L-arginine [the {{substrate}} {{for the formation}} of nitric oxide (NO) in endothelial cells] on the reactivity of isolated vascular preparations was studied. Rings of rat aorta, with or without endothelium, were suspended in organ chambers for the measurement of isometric <b>force.</b> After various <b>incubation</b> periods in physiological salt solution (37 °C, 95 % O 2 and 5 % CO 2), they were contracted with phenylephrine (10 - 6 M) before the addition of cumulative concentrations of L-arginine. L-Arginine evoked only minor changes in tension in preparations incubated for 0. 5 h. However, when the incubation period was longer than 2 h, the amino acid evoked concentration- and time-dependent relaxations in preparations both with and without endothelium. The relaxations evoked by L-arginine were impaired by nitro-L-arginine and methylene blue. Other basic cationic amino acids (D-arginine, L-homoarginine, L-citrulline, L-lysine, and L-ornithine) evoked only small or no relaxations in both types of preparations. These observations demonstrate that L-arginine stereoselectively and specifically relaxes the rat aorta whether or not it contains the endothelium; this response depends on the duration of the prior incubation of the rings in physiological salt solution. The relaxations are impaired by inhibitors of both the formation and the action of NO, demonstrating that the endothelial cells and the vascular smooth muscle of the rat aorta possess an L-arginine - NO pathway(s) associated with relaxation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
