5|$|Schnaufer {{was taken}} {{prisoner}} of war by the British Army in Schleswig-Holstein in May 1945. According to Schumann, {{he was taken to}} England for interrogation. In this account British authorities were especially <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>knowing</b> whether his achievements had been made under the influence of methamphetamine or other stimulating psychoactive drugs which induce temporary improvements in either mental or physical functions or both. He was released later that year in November following a bout of diphtheria.|$|E

In some cases, crawlers may be accidentally trapped in a crawler trap {{or they may be}} overloading a Web server with requests, and the owner needs to stop the crawler. Identification is also useful for administrators that are <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>knowing</b> when they may expect their Web pages to be indexed by a particular search engine.|$|E

Tibetans, exiled from their homeland for more than three generations, face some of the same assimilation challenges experienced by Jewish diaspora. The Dalai Lama was <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>knowing</b> how the Jews had survived with their culture intact. That journey was chronicled in Rodger Kamenetz' 1994 book The Jew in the Lotus.|$|E

25|$|Continuous {{reporting}} {{is a point}} of constant debate. Some parties, including analysts and investors, are <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>knowing</b> how a company is doing at a given point in time. They argue that near real-time information would provide them with the ability to take advantage of important business moves as they happen. However, opponents are skeptical of how the raw information can be useful and fear information overload, or that there would be too much irrelevant information out there. Additionally, some companies are fearful that continuously reported financial information would give away important strategic moves and undermine competitive advantage.|$|E

While Scully {{does not believe in}} Bruckman's power, the two develop a fast friendship. Scully asks Bruckman if he can see his own end. He replies that he can see their end – that they will end up in bed together, in a very special moment neither of them will ever forget. This reinforces her skepticism. Bruckman asks Scully why she is not <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>knowing</b> how she will die. Scully finally asks him to tell her, to which Bruckman, joyfully, but cryptically, replies, [...] "You don't." ...|$|E

As he was keenly <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>knowing</b> {{the success of}} this co-operative, he stayed {{overnight}} with farmers in a village, and even had dinner with a farmer's family. He discussed his wish with Mr Verghese Kurien, then the General Manager of Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers’ Union Ltd (Amul) to replicate this model {{to other parts of the}} country for improving the socio-economic conditions of farmers. As a result of this visit, the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) was established at Anand in 1965 ...|$|E
2500|$|The Simplex {{algorithm}} and its variants fall in {{the family}} of edge-following algorithms, so named because they solve linear programming problems by moving from vertex to vertex along edges of a polytope. [...] This means that their theoretical performance {{is limited by the}} maximum number of edges between any two vertices on the LP polytope. [...] As a result, we are <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>knowing</b> the maximum graph-theoretical diameter of polytopal graphs. [...] It has been proved that all polytopes have subexponential diameter. The recent disproof of the Hirsch conjecture is the first step to prove whether any polytope has superpolynomial diameter. If any such polytopes exist, then no edge-following variant can run in polynomial time. Questions about polytope diameter are of independent mathematical interest.|$|E
2500|$|Thernstrom's stance {{has been}} sharply criticized by other conservatives, such as federal {{prosecutor}} Andrew C. McCarthy, {{who wrote a}} response to Thernstrom in a later issue of National Review. He points out that a year earlier Thernstrom had been among those criticizing the Obama administration's decision to dismiss the case, {{and that she had}} not explained the reason for her reversal of opinion. McCarthy referred to the comment by Bartle Bull, who witnessed the incident, that it was the most blatant form of voter intimidation he had ever encountered in his life, as well as {{the fact that it was}} highly unusual for the case to be dismissed after a default judgment against the defendants had already been won. In reply to McCarthy, Thernstrom clarified her opinion by stating that [...] "I still have questions about DOJ's conduct, and I remain <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>knowing</b> more about why the department declined to pursue the case." [...] However, she added that as she learned more about the case, she became doubtful it was as severe an example of voter intimidation as it first appeared to be, and was of the opinion that [...] "the incident was not of sufficient importance to be the primary focus of our yearlong project." ...|$|E

5000|$|However, {{even if the}} {{requested}} information or documents are sensitive and exceptions apply, some part of it could be released by public bodies on the ground of two factors. The first is the right of partial access according to which authorities have the duty of removing sensitive information and release {{the rest of the}} document. The second [...] "exception to exceptions" [...] applies when transparency overrides secrecy, thus even if the information is sensitive the public <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>knowing</b> it is stronger. In this particular case public officials have to apply the so-called [...] "public interest test", meaning that they have to scrutinize and ponder both the exceptions for not releasing information and the reasons of public <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>knowing</b> the information required. Many national access to information laws foresees this kind of test.|$|R

But there is also a theoretical <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>knowing</b> how similar the two grammar formalisms are. Since Grammatical Framework is more expressive than Regulus, the resulting Regulus grammars can be overgenerating. We therefore describe a subclass of Grammatical Framework for which the algorithm results in an equivalent Regulus grammar. ...|$|R
