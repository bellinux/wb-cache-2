5|$|An {{important}} pathophysiological {{mechanism of}} leukemogenesis in AML is the epigenetic induction of dedifferentiation by genetic mutations that alter {{the function of}} epigenetic enzymes, such as the DNA demethylase TET2 and the metabolic enzymes IDH1 and IDH2, which lead to the generation of a novel oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate, which inhibits the activity of epigenetic enzymes such as TET2. The hypothesis <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> epigenetic mutations lead to the silencing of tumor suppressor genes and/or the activation of proto-oncogenes.|$|E
5|$|Following Freud's early speculations about infant {{experience}} with the mother, Otto Rank suggested a powerful role in personality development for birth trauma. Rank stressed the traumatic experience of birth as a separation from the mother, rather than birth as an uncomfortable physical event. Not long after Rank's introduction of this idea, Ian Suttie, a British physician whose early death limited his influence, suggested that the child's basic need is for mother-love, and his greatest anxiety <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> love will be lost.|$|E
5|$|The limited {{evidence}} on auxiliary centuriones and decuriones <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> officers could be directly commissioned {{as well as}} promoted from the ranks. Many appear {{to have come from}} provincial aristocracies. Those rising from the ranks could be promotions from the legions {{as well as from the}} regiment's own ranks. In the Julio-Claudian period auxiliary centuriones and decuriones were a roughly equal split between citizens and peregrini, though later citizens became predominant due to the spread of citizenship among military families. Because centuriones and decuriones often rose from the ranks, they have often been compared to warrant officers such as sergeants-major in modern armies. However, centurions' social role was much wider than a modern warrant-officer. In addition to their military duties, centurions performed a wide range of administrative tasks, which was necessary in the absence of an adequate bureaucracy to support provincial governors. They were also relatively wealthy, due to their high salaries (see table above). However, most of the surviving evidence concerns legionary centurions and it is uncertain whether their auxiliary counterparts shared their high status and non-military role.|$|E

25|$|Within Christian traditions, many {{instances}} reported involve images of Jesus or other Christian figures seen in food; in the Muslim world, structures {{in food and}} other natural objects {{may be perceived as}} religious text in Arabic script, particularly the word Allah or verses from the Qur'an.

25|$|The Feminist (history {{as gender}} struggle) view {{of women in}} the Arab world, and {{in other areas of the}} world, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> women have {{throughout}} history experienced discrimination and have been subject to restrictions of their freedoms and rights. Some of these practices are based on religious beliefs, but many of the limitations are cultural and emanate from tradition as well as religion. These main constraints that create an obstacle towards women's rights and liberties are reflected in laws dealing with criminal justice, economy, education and healthcare.|$|E

(See Japanese and South Korean nationality laws.) Of course, they are strictly Japanese/South Korean internal affairs and have to be solved by Japanese/South Korean citizens themselves, according to the laws of their own country. They are not problems of the Dutch state, and all that the Dutch laws say in this respect <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> Dutch subjects with dual nationality are allowed to renounce to their Dutch nationality.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{knowledge}} available about the whole Antarctic ecosystem, large scale experiments involving krill are already being performed to increase carbon sequestration: in vast areas of the Southern Ocean {{there are plenty of}} nutrients, but still, the phytoplankton does not grow much. These areas are termed HNLC (high nutrient, low chlorophyll). The phenomenon is called the Antarctic Paradox, and occurs because iron is missing. Relatively small injections of iron from research vessels trigger very large blooms, covering many miles. The hope <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> large scale exercises will draw down carbon dioxide as compensation for the burning of fossil fuels.|$|E
25|$|Although radial {{velocity}} of the star only gives a planet's minimum mass, if the planet's spectral lines can be distinguished from the star's spectral lines then the {{radial velocity}} of the planet itself can be found, and this gives the inclination of the planet's orbit. This enables measurement of the planet's actual mass. This also rules out false positives, and also provides data about {{the composition of the}} planet. The main issue <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> detection is possible only if the planet orbits around a relatively bright star and if the planet reflects or emits a lot of light.|$|E
25|$|JSL is a romanization {{system based}} on Japanese phonology, {{designed}} using the linguistic principles used by linguists in designing writing systems for languages {{that do not have}} any. It is a purely phonemic system, using exactly one symbol for each phoneme, and marking pitch accent using diacritics. It was created for Eleanor Harz Jorden's system of Japanese language teaching. Its principle <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> a system enables students to better internalize the phonology of Japanese. Since it does not have any of the advantages for non-native speakers that the other systems have, and the Japanese already have a writing system for their language, JSL is not widely used outside the educational environment.|$|E
