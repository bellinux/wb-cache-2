40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{sloshing}} impact induced strain exerted on {{the insulation}} panel of a {{liquefied natural gas}} (LNG) tank was measured in situ by using a fiber-optic Bragg reflector and a wavelength interrogator. To prevent the catastrophic failure of the LNG vessel caused by sloshing impact on the insulation panel, continuous monitoring and dynamic analysis of the induced strain are required. In this study, two different fiber-optic systems are developed based on (1) <b>edge</b> <b>filter</b> <b>type</b> and (2) arrayed waveguide grating type. Bragg reflection sensors were embedded inside the reinforced polyurethane foam insulating panel, which was used to cover the inner surface of the LNG tank. Initially, an <b>edge</b> <b>filter</b> <b>type</b> fiber-optic system is attempted for measuring strain for high speed applications. Another type of fiber-optic system, arrayed waveguide grating, is developed. By incorporating an arrayed waveguide grating device for the interrogation of the reflected wavelength from the Bragg reflector, a dynamic strain of 4000 me occurring within a duration of 10 ms {{was able to be}} measured in real time. The accuracy of the measured data was confirmed by comparing it to the data obtained by means of a high speed camera.

However, different <b>edge</b> <b>types</b> exist in real-world images such as material, shadow and highlight edges.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the head losses in several type metal body disc filters manufactured by domestic companies. In order to meet the objective, three different filter designs (L, LT and Y type), each at four different inlet and outlet pipe diameters, were used to measure the head losses at different flow rates in the laboratory. A total of sixteen filters manufactured by three domestic companies (A, B and C) and two different disc elements (linear and curly) were taken into consideration in this study. A comparison of the different filter designs in terms of measured the head losses indicated that in all cases while the L <b>type</b> <b>filters</b> gave the highest head loss, the other two designs provided less head losses at the same flow rate. Furthermore, the head losses in C−LT <b>type</b> <b>filters</b> with curly groove shape discs were less than B−LT <b>type</b> <b>filters</b> with linear groove shape discs in comparing with the LT <b>type</b> <b>filters</b> produced by two different manufacturers even though the design and the size of the filter body were similar. The differences in the head loss can be clarified with the help of the results obtained from the structural characteristic of filtering elements. As a result, in drip irrigation systems, the use of Y and LT <b>type</b> disc <b>filters</b> with curly groove shaped discs are recommended in order to obtain less head losses and low energy requirements when compared with filters used in this study.

However, {{little is known about}} the role of forest <b>edge</b> <b>type</b> in invasive species patterns. In the Northern Rocky Mountains of the United States, disturbance-caused forest edges are a common feature in the landscape with anthropogenic (e. g. roadside, clearcut) and natural (e. g. burned, windthrown) <b>edge</b> <b>types.</b> In this paper we examine patterns of alien species invasion and native community structure across three forest <b>edge</b> <b>types</b> in Pinus contorta forests including contrasts between undeveloped landscapes in Yellowstone National Park (YNP), and developed (roaded and logged) portions of the adjacent Gallatin National Forest (GNF). Six sets of transects were located in each of five study sites, including clearcut, bum and highway <b>edge</b> <b>types.</b> When bum and highways edges were compared between GNF and YNP, landscape matrix did not have a significant effect on either alien species richness or cover. In both landscapes, highway edges had higher alien species richness and cover than burn edges. For burn and highway edges, alien species richness and cover were significantly related to <b>edge</b> <b>type,</b> distance from <b>edge</b> and the interaction between both variables. In Gallatin NF, alien species were concentrated along highway edges, while burn and clearcut edges are significantly less invaded. Overall, alien species richness was negatively correlated with native species richness in plots with at least one alien species (R- 2 = 0. 30, p < 0. 001). We were able to explain from 23 to 68 % of the variation in alien species richness from simple measures of vegetation structure within each of the <b>edge</b> <b>types.</b> Our study suggests that at least for high elevation conifer ecosystems such as West Yellowstone, alien plant invasion into interior forest is significantly enhanced by disturbance edges only along roadsides. Further studies are needed to determine causal mechanisms that explain the high degree of invisibility of roadside edges. Our results highlight the need for careful planning and management of roads, as they may become a primary conduit of alien plant invasions...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} terminology integration {{characteristics of}} local specialty specific and general vocabularies {{in order to}} facilitate the appropriate inclusion and mapping of these terms into a large-scale terminology. METHODS: We compared the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and positive likelihood ratios for Automated Term Composition to correctly map 9050 local specialty specific (dermatology) terms and 4994 local general terms to UMLS using Metaphrase. Results were systematically combined among exact matches, semantic <b>type</b> <b>filtered</b> matches, and non-filtered matches. For the general set, an analysis of semantic <b>type</b> <b>filtering</b> was performed. RESULTS: Dermatology exact matches defined a sensitivity of 51 % (57 % for general terms) and a specificity of 86 % (92 % general terms). Including semantic <b>type</b> <b>filtered</b> matches increased sensitivity (75 % dermatology; 88 % general); as did inclusion of non-filtered matches (98 % and 99 %). These inclusions correspondingly decreased specificity (filtered: 82 % and 74 %; non-filtered: 52 % and 32 %). Positive predictive values for exact matches (93. 0 % dermatology, 97. 6 % general) were improved by small but significant (p < 0. 001) margins by including filtered matches (95. 1 % dermatology, 98. 4 % general) but decreased with non-filtered matches (89. 2 % dermatology, 87. 8 % general). Adding additional semantic <b>types</b> to the <b>filtering</b> algorithm failed to improve the positive predictive value or the positive likelihood ratio of term mapping, in spite of a 2. 3 % improvement in sensitivity.

40|$|We {{consider}} transmission over a wiretap channel {{where both}} the main channel and the wiretapper's channel are Binary Erasure Channels (BEC). We propose a code construction method using two <b>edge</b> <b>type</b> LDPC codes {{based on the}} coset encoding scheme. Using a standard LDPC ensemble with a given threshold over the BEC, we give a construction for a two <b>edge</b> <b>type</b> LDPC ensemble with the same threshold. If the given standard LDPC ensemble has degree two variable nodes, our construction gives rise to degree one variable nodes in the code used over the main channel. This results in zero threshold over the main channel. In order to circumvent this problem, we numerically optimize the degree distribution of the two <b>edge</b> <b>type</b> LDPC ensemble. We find that the resulting ensembles are able to perform close to the boundary of the rate-equivocation region of the wiretap channel. There are two performance criteria for a coding scheme used over a wiretap channel: reliability and secrecy. The reliability measure corresponds to the probability of decoding error for the intended receiver. This can be easily measured using density evolution recursion. However, it is more challenging to characterize secrecy, corresponding to the equivocation of the message for the wiretapper. Méasson, Montanari, and Urbanke have shown how the equivocation can be measured for {{a broad range of}} standard LDPC ensembles for transmission over the BEC under the point-to-point setup. By generalizing the method of Méasson, Montanari, and Urbanke to two <b>edge</b> <b>type</b> LDPC ensembles, we show how the equivocation for the wiretapper can be computed. We find that relatively simple constructions give very good secrecy performance and are close to the secrecy capacity. However finding explicit sequences of two <b>edge</b> <b>type</b> LDPC ensembles which achieve secrecy capacity is a more difficult problem. We pose it as an interesting open problem.
