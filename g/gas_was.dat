5|$|The Iroquois and Delaware Indians {{were the}} first {{inhabitants}} of the Kettle Creek watershed. The first European settler arrived in 1794 and with more settlers arriving in the following decades. The coal mining industry began in the watershed in 1874 and lasted until the 1970s. The lumbering industry lasted from the mid-1800s to around 1910. Natural <b>gas</b> <b>was</b> also extracted in the watershed in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|After the Gas Boom {{began to}} sweep {{the state in the}} 1880s, Lilly and other Commercial Club members {{advocated}} the creation of a public corporation to pump natural gas from the ground, pipe it to Indianapolis from the Trenton Gas Field, and provide it at low cost to businesses and homes. The project {{led to the creation of}} the Consumer Gas Trust Company, which Lilly named. The gas company provided low-cost heating fuel that made urban living much more desirable. The <b>gas</b> <b>was</b> further used to create electricity to run Indianapolis's first public transportation venture, a streetcar system.|$|E
5|$|Breathing quality gases do not {{normally}} deteriorate during storage in steel or aluminium cylinders. Provided there is insufficient water content to promote internal corrosion, the stored gas will remain unchanged for years if stored at temperatures within the allowed working range for the cylinder, usually below 65°C. If {{there is any}} doubt, a check of oxygen fraction will indicate whether the gas has changed (the other components are inert). Any unusual smells would be {{an indication that the}} cylinder or <b>gas</b> <b>was</b> contaminated at the time of filling. However some authorities recommend releasing most of the contents and storing cylinders with a small positive pressure.|$|E
40|$|Natural <b>gas</b> <b>is</b> a {{naturally}} occurring mixture of hydrocarbon and non-hydrocarbon gases found under the earth's surface. The principal constituent of natural <b>gas</b> <b>is</b> Methane, so natural <b>gas</b> has <b>been</b> widely {{used as a}} clean energy resource. Natural <b>gas</b> <b>is</b> usually liquefied {{for the convenience of}} the transport and storage, because the volume of LNG is about 1 / 600 that of the gas in its vapor state...|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} the war, {{there was}} {{considerable}} debate over the future of the pipelines. The major oil companies, such as Standard Oil, campaigned for the conversion of the pipelines for the transfer of natural gas. Demand for natural <b>gas</b> <b>was</b> rising rapidly, and it was produced in large quantities in the Texas oilfields, but could not be got to market in the north-east and was otherwise burnt off uselessly into the atmosphere. The railroad and coal companies, who saw this as likely to introduce additional competition for coal and coal gas, and therefore lower demand for their goods and services, argued against this move. The smaller oil companies proposed continuing to use the pipelines for oil in order to undermine the transport monopolies of the larger corporations.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine <b>gas</b> <b>was</b> {{also used}} during the Iraq War in Anbar Province in 2007, with insurgents packing truck bombs with mortar shells and {{chlorine}} tanks. The attacks killed two people from the explosives and sickened more than 350. Most of the deaths were caused {{by the force of}} the explosions rather than the effects of chlorine since the toxic gas is readily dispersed and diluted in the atmosphere by the blast. In some bombings, over a hundred civilians were hospitalized due to breathing difficulties. The Iraqi authorities tightened security for elemental chlorine, which is essential for providing safe drinking water to the population.|$|E
5|$|Free oxygen <b>gas</b> <b>was</b> {{almost nonexistent}} in Earth's {{atmosphere}} before photosynthetic archaea and bacteria evolved, probably about 3.5 billion years ago. Free oxygen {{first appeared in}} significant quantities during the Paleoproterozoic eon (between 3.0 and 2.3 billion years ago). For the first billion years, any free oxygen produced by these organisms combined with dissolved iron in the oceans to form banded iron formations. When such oxygen sinks became saturated, free oxygen began to outgas from the oceans 3–2.7billion years ago, reaching 10% of its present level around 1.7billion years ago.|$|E
50|$|Tight <b>gas</b> <b>is</b> natural <b>gas</b> {{produced}} from reservoir rocks with such low permeability that {{massive hydraulic fracturing}} is necessary to produce the well at economic rates. Tight <b>gas</b> reservoirs <b>are</b> generally defined as having less than 0.1 millidarcy (mD) matrix permeability and less than ten percent matrix porosity. Although shales have low permeability and low effective porosity, shale <b>gas</b> <b>is</b> usually considered separate from tight <b>gas,</b> which <b>is</b> contained most commonly in sandstone, but sometimes in limestone. Tight <b>gas</b> <b>is</b> considered an unconventional source of natural gas.|$|R
5000|$|The {{purity of}} a <b>gas</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} {{expressed as a}} grade prefixed with the letter N giving the [...] "number of nines" [...] in the percentage or decimal fraction. An N2.0 <b>gas</b> <b>is</b> 99% pure, and 1% (by volume) impurities. An N6.0 <b>gas</b> <b>is</b> 99.9999% (six nines) pure, with 1 part per million (1 ppm) impurities.|$|R
50|$|A {{breathing}} <b>gas</b> <b>is</b> {{a mixture}} of gaseous chemical elements and compounds used for respiration. The essential component for any breathing <b>gas</b> <b>is</b> a partial pressure of oxygen of between roughly 0.16 and 1.60 bar at the ambient pressure. The oxygen is usually the only metabolically active component unless the <b>gas</b> <b>is</b> an anaesthetic mixture. Some of the oxygen in the breathing <b>gas</b> <b>is</b> consumed by the metabolic processes, and the inert components are unchanged, and serve mainly to dilute the oxygen to an appropriate concentration, and are therefore also known as diluent gases.|$|R
5|$|From the 1950s until 2009 the {{buildings}} were used as a barn for animals and agricultural machinery. It has since been restored and had a biomass boiler installed. During the restoration an unexplained series of unusual pipework was discovered in {{the floor of the}} building. The building now acts as a visitor centre, which includes access to the dynamo room where acetylene <b>gas</b> <b>was</b> produced along with a thermalume generator which produced gas from petrol and air.|$|E
5|$|Keeping the {{cylinder}} slightly pressurized {{at all times}} during storage and transportation reduces the possibility of inadvertently contaminating the inside of {{the cylinder}} with corrosive agents, such as sea water, or toxic material, such as oils, poisonous gases, fungi or bacteria. A normal dive will end with some pressure remaining in the cylinder; if an emergency ascent has been made due to an out-of-gas incident, the cylinder will normally still contain some pressure and unless the cylinder had been submerged deeper than where the last <b>gas</b> <b>was</b> used it is not possible for water to get in during the dive.|$|E
5|$|Ohio River ports {{had been}} stifled by an embargo on the Confederate South and never fully {{recovered}} their economic prominence, leading the south into an economic decline. By contrast, northern Indiana experienced an economic boom when natural <b>gas</b> <b>was</b> {{discovered in the}} 1880s, which directly contributed to {{the rapid growth of}} cities such as Gas City, Hartford City, and Muncie where a glass industry developed to utilize the cheap fuel. The Indiana gas field was then the largest known in the world. The boom lasted until the early 20th century, when the gas supplies ran low. This began northern Indiana's industrialization.|$|E
30|$|Because {{the energy}} inputs {{for oil and}} <b>gas</b> {{extraction}} <b>are</b> combined in China, the EROI of conventional <b>gas</b> cannot <b>be</b> calculated. The EROI for conventional oil and <b>gas</b> <b>is</b> approximately 10 : 1 (Hu et al. 2013), which is slightly {{lower than that of}} CSG. However, the EROI of conventional <b>gas</b> <b>is</b> expected to be higher than that of CSG because <b>gas</b> production <b>is</b> in the initial development stage, which implies a higher EROI than for oil production (Kong et al. 2016 b). Currently, the slow development of conventional <b>gas</b> <b>is</b> due to access restrictions and government pricing, which should be abolished in the future.|$|R
40|$|The {{notion of}} {{fluctuation}} indices, characterizing thermodynamic stability of statistical systems, is advanced. These indices are especially useful for investigating {{the stability of}} nonuniform and trapped atomic assemblies. The fluctuation indices are calculated for several systems with Bose-Einstein condensate.
