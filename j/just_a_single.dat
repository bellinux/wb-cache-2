5|$|Burnside: Spin-off {{from the}} main British series, {{following}} ex-DI Frank Burnside in his transfer and promotion to the National Crime Squad. The programme lasted for <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> series of six episodes, debuting in the UK on 6 July 2000. The series was created and produced by Richard Handford. On 8 October 2008, the series was released on DVD in Australia in a three-disc-set.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the AFC had {{undergone}} remarkable development, and its independence {{as a separate}} national force was unique among the Dominions. Deploying <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> aircraft to German New Guinea in 1914, the first operational flight did not occur until 27 May 1915 however, when the Mesopotamian Half Flight was called upon to assist in protecting British oil interests in Iraq. The AFC was soon expanded and four squadrons later saw action in Egypt, Palestine and on the Western Front, where they performed well.|$|E
5|$|Proteins {{can also}} be natural poisons or antinutrients, such as the trypsin inhibitors (discussed above) that are found in some legumes, {{as shown in the}} figure above. A less common class of toxins are toxic enzymes: these act as {{irreversible}} inhibitors of their target enzymes and work by chemically modifying their substrate enzymes. An example is ricin, an extremely potent protein toxin found in castor oil beans. This enzyme is a glycosidase that inactivates ribosomes. Since ricin is a catalytic irreversible inhibitor, this allows <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> molecule of ricin to kill a cell.|$|E

5|$|The 1879 Navy Midshipmen {{football}} team represented the United States Naval Academy in the 1879 college football season. The team {{was the first}} intercollegiate football squad to represent the United States Naval Academy. The team had no coach, as it was entirely student-operated; however, it was captained by squad member Bill Maxwell. The team played <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> game, which was a scoreless tie with the Baltimore Athletic Club. The team was entirely student operated, and was {{not supported by the}} Naval Academy's faculty. The school would not have another football squad until 1882.|$|E
5|$|The club's record win is 17–0 {{in a cup}} {{match against}} Buvik in 2003; the league record is 10–0 against Brann in 1996 and the Champions League record is 6–0 against Helsingborg in 2000. In the league, the team had a record 87–20 goal {{difference}} in 1997, claimed a record 69 points in 2009 and went undefeated in 2010. Rosenborg was relegated after the 1977 season having won <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> match. The record home attendance is 28,569 spectators at Lerkendal Stadion against Lillestrøm in 1985.|$|E
5|$|Also {{announced}} in November 1896 was {{a bill to}} be presented by the District Railway (DR) for a tube railway to be constructed beneath its existing sub-surface line between Gloucester Road and Mansion House stations. The DR operated a steam railway, running in cut and cover tunnels, and planned to ease congestion along its heavily used route by constructing an express line with <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> intermediate station at Charing Cross (now Embankment). The express line was to surface west of Gloucester Road and connect to the DR's existing line at Earl's Court. Since, like the B, the DR's deep tube line would be operated with electric trains, the DR planned to build a generating station adjacent to its Walham Green station (now Fulham Broadway). The bill received assent on 6 August 1897 as the Metropolitan District Railway Act, 1897.|$|E

5|$|Hadspen {{has grown}} without any area {{set aside for}} small {{commercial}} operations, a fact {{that has led to}} <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> shopping complex. There was another service station, in the main street, but it closed in 2008 after operating for approximately forty years. Rutherglen is a holiday village, conference and event centre, and retirement village on the town's west. It is the only premises in Hadspen with a general liquor licence. Rutherglen, or a similarly named premises at the same location, has been used for accommodation since at least 1923. The town has access to reticulated water and sewerage. The town's sewerage has been, since the mid-1970s, processed at a plant near Carrick that also serves that town. Treated waste-water from there is discharged into a tributary of the Liffey River.|$|E
5|$|In February 1976, Koubek {{contributed a}} third {{high-rise}} office building to Farragut Square, {{this one a}} brick-and-solarized glass structure with a glass-and-aluminum penthouse at 818 Connecticut Avenue NW. His massive, grid-like 400 North Capitol Street, {{one of the few}} office buildings he designed with a plaza between two wings, opened in June. His 12-story International Square building—with its inverted setbacks above the Farragut West Washington Metro station, ninth-floor balcony with non-structural columns, interior atrium, and ground level set-back retail concourse—opened in November. Originally <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> office building on a corner for a city block, it expanded to occupy nearly the entire block with the addition of two almost identical towers in 1979 and 1980. (The atrium was upgraded and a fountain added in 1992.) Two blocks to the west, in April 1977 Koubek also designed a fairly nondescript office building at 1990 K Street NW.|$|E

5|$|NSB assured {{passengers}} {{that the}} trains were more capable than their reputation, {{and that they}} would continue to be used on the Bergen Line. If an alternative was needed, NSB stated {{that they would have to}} use El 18 locomotives in combination with B5 carriages. However, the carriages were at the time being used on regional rush-hour trains around Oslo, were in need of renovation and did not offer the facilities required by intercity travelers. In October, NSB stated that they planned to withdraw Class 73 from service on the Bergen Line, because the use of multiple units was not flexible enough. With locomotive-hauled trains, it was possible for the company to add or remove <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> carriage, but with multiple units, it was necessary to double the capacity if a single unit was insufficient. While originally planned to be introduced in 2008, delays in the upgrades delayed the delivery of the carriages beyond 2010.|$|E
5|$|The 1882 Navy Midshipmen {{football}} team represented the United States Naval Academy in the 1882 college football season. The team {{was the second}} intercollegiate football squad to represent the United States Naval Academy, and the first since 1879. The team was coached by player-coach Vaulx Carter, and was entirely student-operated. It was captained by squad member Alex Jackson. The team played <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> game, an 8 to 0 (8–0) shutout of Johns Hopkins, which was the school's first ever win. The squad was entirely student operated, and was {{not supported by the}} Naval Academy's faculty. The season would mark the beginning of eight season rivalry between the Midshipmen and Johns Hopkins.|$|E
5|$|The 1883 Navy Midshipmen {{football}} team represented the United States Naval Academy in the 1883 college football season. The team {{was the third}} intercollegiate football squad to represent the United States Naval Academy, {{and the first time}} the school participated in consecutive seasons. The squad was captained by member Frank Hill. The team played <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> game, a 2 to 0 (2–0) shutout loss to Johns Hopkins, which was the school's first ever loss. The squad was the first to have the approval of the academy's staff, and is regarded as the first official game played by the Midshipmen. The season continued a seven-season, eight game rivalry between the Naval Academy and Johns Hopkins.|$|E

5|$|The race began {{behind the}} safety car due to rain {{shortly before the}} start. Hamilton was able to convert his pole {{position}} into a third straight victory at the British Grand Prix, leading home Rosberg and Verstappen in changing conditions. Rosberg came {{under investigation by the}} race stewards after he received detailed instructions by his team how to work around a gearbox problem in the closing laps of the race, a practice forbidden under Formula One regulations. He was later handed a ten-second time penalty, demoting him to third place. The result saw Rosberg's championship lead reduced to <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> point over Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|Brodie and Hall {{opened the}} Port Phillip second innings; they added 12 {{in ten minutes}} before Brodie was caught at long off by Tabart and was {{replaced}} by Hamilton. Hall was dismissed leg before wicket from the bowling of McDowall shortly afterwards for six. Lister was caught off the bowling of Field for three and Henty bowled Thomas for a duck. William Phillpot was run out by Tabart for three and Cooper was bowled by Henty for a duck, the fifth man out with the score on 28. Wickets continued to fall, although Hamilton was batting well at the other end. Roger Phillpot, who scored <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>single,</b> was caught by Westbrook off Henty; Marsden was bowled by McDowall for two and Hervey bowled by Henty for one. Meanwhile, Hamilton had batted for an hour to score 35 runs, the highest individual score of the match; he was last man out, leg before wicket to McDowall to end the innings for 57 runs. The innings had lasted 17 overs and taken 80 minutes. The other batsmen had contributed 21 runs (one bye was scored) between them. Henty took five for 26 and McDowall returned figures of three for 21. Van Diemen's Land required 36 runs to win.|$|E
5|$|During {{the spring}} of 1990, Anjali Dutt was hired to replace Moulder, who had left {{to work with the}} bands Shakespears Sister and Ride. Dutt {{assisted}} in the recording of vocals and several guitar tracks. During this period, the band recorded in various studios, often spending <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> day at a studio before deciding that it was unsuitable. In May 1990, My Bloody Valentine settled on Protocol in Holloway as their primary location, and work began in earnest on the album, as well as a second EP, Tremolo. Like Glider, Tremolo contained a song—"To Here Knows When"—that would later appear on Loveless. The band stopped recording during the summer of 1990 in order to tour in support of the release of Glider. When Moulder returned to the project in August, he was surprised by how little work had been completed. By that point Creation Records was concerned at how much the album was costing. Moulder left again in March 1991 to work for the noise pop band The Jesus and Mary Chain.|$|E

5|$|The US Open 2014 saw the Big Four's {{collective}} grip on {{the major}} titles slip still further, however, as Kei Nishikori and Marin Čilić beat Djokovic and Federer in the semi-finals respectively to contest the first Slam final featuring none of the Big Four since the 2005 Australian Open, {{and the first time}} since 2003 that multiple first-time Grand Slam tournament winners have been crowned in a single season. Following the tournament, Murray dropped to 11th in the rankings, his first time outside the top 10 since 2008. The tournament as a whole further signalled the decline of the Big Four's dominance. Towards the end of the year, Andy Murray managed to return to form, winning three titles in Shenzhen, Vienna and Valencia, allowing him to return to the top ten in the rankings and qualify for the Tour Finals, but he bowed out at the group stages following a humiliating defeat by Federer, in which he won <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> game. Indeed, throughout the year Murray failed to register a single victory against another member of the Big Four in nine meetings.|$|E
5|$|The {{quarries}} at Stonesfield, {{which were}} worked until 1911, continued to produce Megalosaurus bucklandii fossils, mostly single bones from the pelvis and hindlimbs. Vertebrae and skull bones are rare. In 2010, Roger Benson counted {{a total of}} 103 specimens from the Stonesfield Slate, from a minimum of seven individuals. It has been contentious whether this material represents <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> taxon. In 2004, Julia Day and Paul Barrett claimed {{that there were two}} morphotypes present, based on small differences in the thighbones. In 2008 Benson favoured this idea, but in 2010 concluded the differences were illusory. A maxilla fragment, specimen OUM J13506, was, in 1869 assigned, by Thomas Huxley, to M. bucklandii. In 1992 Robert Thomas Bakker claimed it represented a member of the Sinraptoridae; in 2007, Darren Naish thought it was a separate species belonging to the Abelisauroidea. In 2010, Benson pointed out that the fragment was basically indistinguishable from other known M. bucklandii maxillae, to which it had in fact not been compared by the other authors.|$|E
5|$|The {{coal mining}} {{industry}} of the Rhondda was artificially buoyed {{throughout the war}} years, though there were expectations {{of a return to}} the pre-1939 industrial collapse {{after the end of the}} Second World War. There was a sense of salvation when the government announced the nationalisation of the British Coalmines in 1947; but the following decades saw a continual reduction in the output from the Rhondda mines. From 15,000 miners in 1947, Rhondda had <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>single</b> pit within the valleys producing coal in 1984, located at Maerdy. The decline in the mining of coal after World War II was a country wide issue, but South Wales and Rhondda were affected to a higher degree than other areas of Britain. Oil had superseded coal as the fuel of choice in many industries and there was political pressure influencing the supply of oil. Of the few industries that were still reliant on coal, the demand was for quality coals, especially coking coal which was required by the steel industry. Fifty percent of Glamorgan coal was now supplied to steelworks, with the second biggest market being domestic heating, which the 'smokeless' coal of the Rhondda became once again fashionable after the publication of the Clean Air Act. These two markets now controlled the fate of the mines in the Rhondda, and as demand fell from both sectors the knock-on effect on the mining industry was further contraction. In addition exports to other areas of Europe, traditionally France, Italy and the Low Countries, experienced a massive decline; from 33 per cent around the start of the 20th century to roughly 5 per cent by 1980.|$|E
