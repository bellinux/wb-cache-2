5|$|Copenhagen's urban {{development}} {{in the first half}} of the 20th century was heavily influenced by industrialisation. After World War II, Copenhagen Municipality adopted Fordism and repurposed its medieval centre to facilitate private automobile <b>infrastructure</b> <b>in</b> response to innovations in transport, trade and communication. Copenhagen’s spacial planning in this time frame was characterised by the separation of land uses: an approach which requires residents to travel by car to access facilities of different uses.|$|E

We {{approach}} the concept of urban discontinuity, ways to produce and read landscapes and new paradigms in terms of urban form. The impact of <b>infrastructures</b> <b>in</b> landscape is based on Lisbon Metropolitan Area recent <b>infrastructures.</b> <b>In</b> order to discuss solutions for the impact of <b>infrastructures</b> <b>in</b> landscape, the relation between accessibilities, urban grid and urban tissue and the production of consolidated, non-consolidated and traced public spaces will be approached. The paper focuses on four nodes on the motorway A 2, the main access to Lisbon by south. To conclude, a model to deal with urban discontinuities will be presented, integrating as a new element the concept of new urban structure...|$|R

5|$|The most {{significant}} current problems in Indonesian aviation are poor development {{and maintenance of}} air transportation infrastructure, especially in remote areas.

5|$|Atlantic storms are {{becoming}} more destructive financially, since five of the ten most expensive storms in United States history have occurred since 1990. According to the World Meteorological Organization, “recent increase in societal impact from tropical cyclones has largely been caused by rising concentrations of population and <b>infrastructure</b> <b>in</b> coastal regions.” Pielke et al. (2008) normalized mainland U.S. hurricane damage from 1900–2005 to 2005 values and found no remaining trend of increasing absolute damage. The 1970s and 1980s were notable because of the extremely low amounts of damage compared to other decades. The decade 1996–2005 has the second most damage among the past 11 decades, with only the decade 1926–1935 surpassing its costs. The most damaging single storm is the 1926 Miami hurricane, with $157billion of normalized damage.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{population}} density of Varanasi and {{the increasing number of}} tourists, the Uttar Pradesh government and international non-governmental organisations and institutions have expressed grave concern for the pollution and pressures on <b>infrastructure</b> <b>in</b> the city, mainly the sewage, sanitation, and drainage components. Pollution of the Ganges is a particular source of worry because of the religious significance of the river, the dependence of people on it as a source of drinking water, and its prominence as a symbol of Varanasi and the city itself. The sewage problem is exacerbated by the role of the Ganges in bathing and in river traffic, which is very difficult to control. Because of the sewage, people using local untreated water have higher risk of contracting a range of water-borne stomach diseases.|$|E
