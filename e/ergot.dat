5|$|Many fungi produce biologically active compounds, {{several of}} which are toxic to animals or plants and are {{therefore}} called mycotoxins. Of particular relevance to humans are mycotoxins produced by molds causing food spoilage, and poisonous mushrooms (see above). Particularly infamous are the lethal amatoxins in some Amanita mushrooms, and <b>ergot</b> alkaloids, which {{have a long history}} of causing serious epidemics of ergotism (St Anthony's Fire) in people consuming rye or related cereals contaminated with sclerotia of the <b>ergot</b> fungus, Claviceps purpurea. Other notable mycotoxins include the aflatoxins, which are insidious liver toxins and highly carcinogenic metabolites produced by certain Aspergillus species often growing in or on grains and nuts consumed by humans, ochratoxins, patulin, and trichothecenes (e.g., T-2 mycotoxin) and fumonisins, which have significant impact on human food supplies or animal livestock.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{returns to}} Washington and is congratulated by Mulder {{for being the}} first person to make a second X-File appearance. Ed was brought to a burn center in Philadelphia where the <b>ergot</b> {{chemicals}} were found in his blood; it was also in Scully's blood, but not enough to cause hallucinations. Mulder wonders if this all happened because of their earlier argument, to which Scully replies that not everything is about him.|$|E
5|$|Eric Pringle, {{a veteran}} of 2D digital animation, was {{employed}} as animation director, providing Jones with much technical assistance. Pringle's colleagues from Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, another Cartoon Network production, comprised a team of around fifteen full-time animators at the network's studio, all working on Apple computers. Greg Miller was hired as supervising director, Martin Cendreda as technical director, and John Pham with Jon Vermilyea as character designers. Miller is the creator of Whatever Happened to... Robot Jones?, another series on the network. Vermilyea worked also as a character designer on the network's series Adventure Time, while Cendreda, Pham, and Jones all contributed to the anthology comic book Kramers <b>Ergot.</b> Michael Yank was employed as a writer for most episodes, with Mirari Films' CEO Eric Kaplan supervising the creation of scripts.|$|E
5|$|Many fungi {{have been}} used as folk {{medicines}} around the world, including in Europe and in India where traditions are well documented. Some have been found to have useful active ingredients, though these do not always correspond with traditional uses of the fungi concerned. <b>Ergot</b> and various cereal smuts, such as Ustilago tritici (wheat grain smut) were used for disorders of pregnancy. Yeasts, made into a boiled paste with wheat flour, were used in India to treat fevers and dysentery. Wounds were treated in Europe with moulds, using for example a slice of mouldy bread or mouldy wheat straw, with active ingredients patulin and other penicillin-like compounds.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>ergot</b> {{alkaloids}} {{are mostly}} nonspecific 5-HT receptor antagonists, a few <b>ergot</b> derivatives such as metergoline bind preferentially {{to members of}} the 5-HT2 receptor family.|$|E

25|$|Loline bioactivities {{show some}} {{unexpected}} variability with variation in their concentration in grass tissues. For example, the tall fescue endophyte, N. coenophialum, {{has been associated}} with enhanced resistance to the migratory root-endoparasitic nematode, Pratylenchus scribneri. Interestingly, at low concentrations, N-formylloline serves as a chemoattractant for P. scribneri, but acts as a repellant at higher concentrations. However, <b>ergot</b> alkaloids also have repellent and immobilizing effects on P. scribneri, and an endophyte of perennial ryegrass lacking lolines, and genetically engineered to produce no <b>ergot</b> alkaloids, exhibits resistance to this nematode. Therefore, the relative importance of the loline and <b>ergot</b> alkaloids to nematode resistance remains unclear.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} of <b>ergot</b> poisoning serving a ritual purpose in the ritual killing of certain bog bodies.|$|E
25|$|Several medications, {{including}} verapamil and nifedipine, {{as well as}} <b>ergot</b> derivatives such as bromocriptine and pergolide, {{have been}} associated with medication-induced erythromelalgia.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{controls}} {{can also}} be used, but are not considered economical especially in commercial operations, and germination of <b>ergot</b> spores can still occur under favorable conditions even {{with the use of}} such controls.|$|E
25|$|A 2010 book by H. P. Albarelli Jr. {{alleged that}} the 1951 Pont-Saint-Esprit mass {{poisoning}} was part of MKDELTA, that Olson was involved in that event, {{and that he was}} eventually murdered by the CIA. However, academic sources attribute the incident to <b>ergot</b> poisoning through a local bakery.|$|E
25|$|Many {{secondary}} metabolites from endophyte-plant interactions {{have also}} been isolated and used in raw or derived forms to produce a variety of drugs treating many conditions. The toxic properties of <b>ergot</b> alkaloids also make them useful {{in the treatment of}} headaches and throughout the process of giving birth by inducing contractions and stemming hemorrhages. Drugs used to treat Parkinson's Disease have been created from isolates of <b>ergot</b> toxins, although health risks may accompany their use. Ergotamine has also been used to synthesize lysergic acid diethylamide because of its chemical similarity to lysergic acid. The generally chemically-based defense properties of endophytic fungi make them a perfect group of organisms to search for new antibiotic compounds within, as other fungi have in the past yielded such useful drugs as penicillin and streptomycin and plants use their antibiotic qualities as a defense against pathogens.|$|E
25|$|Many epichloae endophytes—including N. coenophialum {{symbiotic}} with Lolium arundinaceum (syn. Festuca arundinacea, tall fescue)—also produce <b>ergot</b> alkaloids {{that are}} toxic to mammalian herbivores. The <b>ergot</b> alkaloids occur at relatively low {{concentrations in the}} plant and are often difficult to detect analytically. By contrast, the lolines frequently accumulate to very high levels in grass tissues, and were, therefore, initially associated also with toxicity to mammalian herbivores. Specifically, the lolines {{were thought to be}} responsible for toxic symptoms called fescue toxicosis displayed by livestock grazing on grasses infected by N. coenophialum. However, subsequently it was demonstrated that only the endophyte-produced <b>ergot</b> alkaloids are responsible for the symptoms of fescue toxicosis (or summer syndrome), and not the lolines which, even at high doses, have only very small physiological effects on mammalians feeders. Another group of alkaloids, the senecio-type alkaloids, are produced by various plants and like the lolines, the senecio alkaloids possess a pyrrolizidine ring structure. Unlike the lolines, however, the senecio alkaloids exhibit strong hepatotoxicity, owing to a double bond between C-1 and C-2 in their ring structure. This double bond is absent in the lolines, explaining the lack of hepatotoxicity of this group of compounds. The lolines have been suggested to inhibit seed germination or growth of other plants (allelopathy), and to increase resistance of infected grasses against drought, but such effects have not been substantiated under more natural conditions of cultivation or in habitats.|$|E
25|$|When milled, the <b>ergot</b> {{is reduced}} to a red powder, obvious in lighter grasses but easy to miss in dark rye flour. In less wealthy countries, {{ergotism}} still occurs; an outbreak in Ethiopia occurred in mid-2001 from contaminated barley. Whenever there {{is a combination of}} moist weather, cool temperatures, delayed harvest in lowland crops and rye consumption, an outbreak is possible.|$|E
25|$|Spanos and Gottlieb also {{state that}} <b>ergot</b> {{poisoning}} has additional symptoms {{not associated with}} the events in Salem, and {{that the proportion of}} children afflicted was less than in a typical ergotism epidemic. Anthropologist H. Sidky noted that ergotism had been known for centuries before the Salem witch trials, and argued that its symptoms would have been recognizable {{during the time of the}} Salem witch trials.|$|E
25|$|Many psychoactive {{agents have}} been {{proposed}} as the significant element of kykeon, though without consensus or conclusive evidence. These include the <b>ergot,</b> a fungal parasite of the barley or rye grain, which contains the alkaloids ergotamine, a precursor to LSD, and ergonovine. However, modern attempts to prepare a kykeon using ergot-parasitized barley have yielded inconclusive results, though Alexander Shulgin and Ann Shulgin describe both ergonovine and LSA to be known to produce LSD-like effects.|$|E
25|$|Research on the catecholamines was {{interwoven}} {{with research}} on their receptors. In 1904, Dale became {{head of the}} Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratory in London and started research on <b>ergot</b> extracts. The relevance of his communication in 1906 ″On some physiological actions of ergot″ lies less in {{the effects of the}} extracts given alone than in their interaction with adrenaline: they reversed the normal pressor effect of adrenaline to a depressor effect and the normal contraction effect on the early-pregnant cat’s uterus to relaxation: adrenaline reversal. The pressor and uterine contraction effects of pituitary extracts, in contrast, remained unchanged, as did the effects of adrenaline on the heart and effects of parasympathetic nerve stimulation. Dale clearly saw the specificity of the ″paralytic″ (antagonist) effect of <b>ergot</b> for ″the so-called myoneural junctions connected with the true sympathetic or thoracic-lumbar division of the autonomic nervous system″ – the adrenoceptors. He also saw its specificity for the ″myoneural junctions″ mediating smooth muscle contraction as opposed to those mediating smooth muscle relaxation. But there he stopped. He did not conceive any close relationship between the smooth muscle-inhibitory and the cardiac sites of action of catecholamines.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} proposed for the causes of dancing mania, and it remains unclear {{whether it was a}} real illness or a social phenomenon. One of the most prominent theories is that victims suffered from <b>ergot</b> poisoning, which was known as St. Anthony's fire in the Middle Ages. During floods and damp periods, ergots were able to grow and affect rye and other crops. Ergotism can cause hallucinations and convulsions, but cannot account for the other strange behaviour most commonly identified with dancing mania.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin D2, or {{ergocalciferol}} {{is found}} in fungus (except alfalfa which is a plantae) and created from viosterol, {{which in turn is}} created when ultraviolet light activates ergosterol (which {{is found in}} fungi and named as a sterol from <b>ergot).</b> Any UV-irradiated fungus including yeast form vitamin D2. Human bioavailability of vitamin D2 from vitamin D2-enhanced button mushrooms via UV-B irradiation is effective in improving vitamin D status and not different from a vitamin D2 supplement according to study. For example, Vitamin D2 from UV-irradiated yeast baked into bread is bioavailable.|$|E
25|$|The {{secondary}} chemicals {{produced by}} endophytic fungi when {{associated with their}} host plants can be very harmful to mammals including livestock and humans, causing more than 600 million dollars in losses due to dead livestock every year. For example, the <b>ergot</b> alkaloids produced by Claviceps spp. have been dangerous contaminants of rye crops for centuries. When not lethal, defense chemicals produced by fungal endophytes may lead to lower productivity in cows and other livestock feeding on infected forage. Reduced nutritional quality of infected plant tissue also lowers the performance of farm animals, compounding the effect of reduced feed uptake when provided with infected plant matter. Reduced frequency of pregnancy and birth has also been reported in cattle and horses fed with infected forage. Consequently, the dairy and meat-production industries must endure substantial economic losses.|$|E
25|$|Some {{chemical}} defenses {{once thought}} to be produced by the plant have since been shown to be synthesized by endophytic fungi. The chemical basis of insect resistance in endophyte-plant defense mutualisms has been most extensively studied in the perennial ryegrass and three major classes of secondary metabolites are found: indole diterpenes, <b>ergot</b> alkaloids and peramine. Related compounds are found across the range of endophytic fungal associations with plants. The terpenes and alkaloids are inducible defenses which act similarly to defensive compounds produced by plants and are highly toxic {{to a wide variety of}} phytophagous insects as well as mammalian herbivores. Peramine occurs widely in endophyte-associated grasses and may also act as a signal to invertebrate herbivores of the presence of more dangerous defensive chemicals. Terpenoids and ketones have been linked to protection from specialist and generalist herbivores (both insect and vertebrate) across the higher plants.|$|E
25|$|Catecholamine receptors {{persisted in}} this {{wavering}} state {{for more than}} forty years. Additional blocking agents were found such as tolazoline in Switzerland and phenoxybenzamine in the United States, but like the <b>ergot</b> alkaloids they blocked only the smooth muscle excitatory receptors. Additional agonists also were synthesized. Outstanding among them became isoprenaline, N-isopropyl-noradrenaline, of Boehringer Ingelheim, studied pharmacologically along with adrenaline and other N-substituted noradrenaline derivatives by Richard Rössler (1897–1945) and Heribert Konzett (1912–2004) in Vienna. The Viennese pharmacologists used their own Konzett-Rössler test to examine bronchodilation. Intravenous injection of pilocarpine to induce bronchospasm was followed by intravenous injection of the agonists. “Arrangement of all amines according to their bronchodilator effect yields a series from the most potent, isopropyl-adrenaline, via the approximately equipotent bodies adrenaline, propyl-adrenaline and butyl-adrenaline, to the weakly active isobutyl-adrenaline.” Isoprenaline also exerted marked positive chronotropic and inotropic effects. Boehringer introduced it for use in asthma in 1940. After the war it became available to Germany’s former enemies {{and over the years}} was traded under about 50 names. In addition to this therapeutic success {{it was one of the}} agonists with which Raymond P. Ahlquist solved the ″myoneural junction″ riddle. “By virtue of this property the reputation of the substance spread all over the world and it became a tool for many investigations on different aspects of pharmacology and therapeutics.” The story had a dark side: overdosage caused numerous deaths due to cardiac side effects, an estaimated three thousands in the United Kingdom alone.|$|E
500|$|... (schizophrenia) None of the {{putative}} diagnoses have gained consensus support, and many scholars {{have argued that}} she didn't display any of the objective symptoms that can accompany the mental illnesses which have been suggested, such as schizophrenia. Dr. Philip Mackowiak dismissed the possibility of schizophrenia and several other disorders (Temporal Lobe Epilepsy and <b>ergot</b> poisoning) in a chapter on Joan of Arc in his book Post-Mortem in 2007.|$|E
500|$|Some {{species such}} as the fly agaric and {{psilocybin}} mushrooms are used for the psychoactive drugs that they contain. These {{are the focus of}} academic study and intense debate in the field of ethnomycology. In the 1950s, the American banker Robert Gordon Wasson participated in a Mazatec psilocybin mushroom ritual, and wrote an influential but controversial book claiming that the Soma mentioned in the Rigveda was Amanita muscaria, the fly agaric. The mycologist John Ramsbottom however confirmed one element that Allegro later wove into his theory, stating in 1953 that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil fresco in the Plaincourault Chapel depicted Amanita muscaria. The <b>ergot</b> fungi whose sclerotia appear as [...] "black grain" [...] in rye and other cereals are implicated in the witch trials of 17th century Norway. The hallucinations caused by ergotism, with visions of Satan as a black dog or cat, caused people to be accused of witchcraft. People in other cultures such as the Aztecs brewed drinks with <b>ergot,</b> which contains alkaloids based on lysergic acid.|$|E
500|$|At {{a meeting}} of the American Gynecological Society in 1920, DeLee sparked {{controversy}} when he presented a paper advocating for the use of a systematic approach to childbirth for physicians, including the use of forceps and episiotomy even in women who had no labor complications. DeLee's [...] "prophylactic forceps operation" [...] consisted of several steps: scopolamine injections in the first stage of labor, ether anesthesia in the next stage, then episiotomy and forceps delivery. <b>Ergot</b> was used in the subsequent manual extraction of the placenta. DeLee reasoned that the episiotomy prevented perineal tears which could cause complications like uterine prolapse and vesicovaginal fistula. He said that the early use of forceps would avoid pressure from the pelvic bones against a baby's head, thus preventing complications like epilepsy and cerebral palsy; DeLee said that fatal complications occurred in 4–5% of labors managed with the traditional conservative approach. Though DeLee said that such interventions should only be carried out by a well-equipped physician specialist, John Whitridge Williams and other prominent obstetricians criticized DeLee sharply. They felt that DeLee was being too aggressive by removing a baby before complications occurred; DeLee's colleagues preferred to be conservative and to manage complications as they arose.|$|E
2500|$|Removal of <b>ergot</b> bodies is done {{by placing}} the yield in a brine solution; the <b>ergot</b> bodies float while the healthy grains sink. Infested fields need to be deep plowed; <b>ergot</b> cannot {{germinate}} if buried more than one inch in soil and therefore won't release its spores into the air. Rotating crops using non-susceptible plants helps reduce infestations since <b>ergot</b> spores only live one year. Crop rotation and deep tillage, such as deep moldboard ploughing, are important components in managing <b>ergot,</b> as many cereal crops in the 21st Century are sown with a [...] "no-till" [...] practice (new crops are seeded directly into the stubble from the previous crop to reduce soil erosion). Wild and escaped grasses and pastures can be mowed before they flower to help limit the spread of <b>ergot.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Ergotism (pron. [...] ) is {{the effect}} of {{long-term}} <b>ergot</b> poisoning, traditionally due to the ingestion of the alkaloids produced by the Claviceps purpurea fungus that infects rye and other cereals, and more recently by the action of a number of ergoline-based drugs. It is also known as ergotoxicosis, <b>ergot</b> poisoning and Saint Anthony's Fire. <b>Ergot</b> poisoning is a proposed explanation of bewitchment.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003 it {{was pointed}} out that ergots {{produced}} by different strains of Claviceps purpurea, and those growing in different soils, may produce different <b>ergot</b> alkaloid compositions. [...] This may explain the different manifestations of ergotism in different outbreaks. For example, an alkaloid present in high concentrations in ergots from Europe east of the Rhine may have caused convulsive ergotism, while <b>ergot</b> from the west caused epidemics of gangrenous ergotism.|$|E
2500|$|In The Road to Eleusis, the authors, R. Gordon Wasson, Albert Hofmann, and Carl A.P. Ruck, {{note the}} {{similarity}} in {{preparation of the}} Vedic Soma and Eleusinain Mysteries Kykeon. [...] The book hypothesizes {{that the source of}} both was <b>ergot</b> (Claviceps purpurea).|$|E
2500|$|The blight, named {{cockspur}} due to {{the appearance}} of infected grains, was identified and named by Denis Dodart, who reported the relation between ergotized rye and bread poisoning {{in a letter to}} the French Royal Academy of Sciences in 1676 (John Ray mentioned <b>ergot</b> for the first time in English the next year). [...] "Ergotism", in this modern sense, was first recorded in 1853.|$|E
2500|$|Notable {{epidemics}} of ergotism occurred up {{into the}} 19th century. Fewer outbreaks have occurred since then due to rye being carefully monitored in developed countries. [...] A severe outbreak of something akin to <b>ergot</b> poisoning occurred, however, in the French village of Pont-Saint-Esprit in 1951, resulting in five deaths. The outbreak, and the diagnostic confusion surrounding it, are vividly described in John Grant Fuller's book The Day of St Anthony's Fire.|$|E
2500|$|The convulsive {{symptoms}} from ergot-tainted rye {{may have}} been the source of accusations of bewitchment that spurred the Salem witch trials. This medical explanation for the theory of [...] "bewitchment" [...] was first propounded by Linnda R. Caporael in 1976 in an article in Science. In her article, Caporael argues that the convulsive symptoms, such as crawling sensations in the skin, tingling in the fingers, vertigo, tinnitus aurium, headaches, disturbances in sensation, hallucination, painful muscular contractions, vomiting, and diarrhea, as well as psychological symptoms, such as mania, melancholia, psychosis, and delirium, were all symptoms reported in the Salem witchcraft records. Caporael also states there was an abundance of rye in the region as well as climate conditions that could support the tainting of rye. In 1982, historian Mary Matossian raised Caporael’s theory in an article in American Scientist in which she argued that symptoms of “bewitchment” resemble the ones exhibited in those afflicted with <b>ergot</b> poisoning.|$|E
2500|$|Laudanum {{was used}} in home {{remedies}} and prescriptions, {{as well as a}} single medication. [...] For example, a 1901 medical book published for home health use gave the following two [...] "Simple Remedy Formulas" [...] for [...] "dysenterry" [...] : (1) Thin boiled starch, 2 ounces; Laudanum, 20 drops; [...] "Use as an injection [...] every six to twelve hours"; (2) Tincture rhubarb, 1 ounce; Laudanum 4 drachms; [...] "Dose: One teaspoonful every three hours." [...] In a section entitled [...] "Professional Prescriptions" [...] is a formula for [...] "diarrhoea (acute)": Tincture opium, deodorized, 15 drops; Subnitrate of bismuth, 2 drachms; Simple syrup, 1/2 ounce; Chalk mixture, 1 1/2 ounces, [...] "A teaspoonful every two or three hours to a child one year old." [...] "Diarrhoea (chronic)": Aqueous extract of <b>ergot,</b> 20 grains; Extract of nux vomica, 5 grains; Extract of Opium, 10 grains, [...] "Make 20 pills. [...] Take one pill every three or four hours." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{hypothesis}} that ergotism could explain cases of bewitchment has {{been subject to}} debate and has been criticized by several scholars. Within a year of Caporael's article, historians Spanos and Gottlieb argued against the idea in the same journal. In Spanos and Gottlieb's rebuttal to Caporael's article, they concluded that there are several flaws in the explanation. For example, they argued that, if the food supply was contaminated, the symptoms would have occurred by household, not individual. However, historian Leon Harrier said that even if supplies were properly cooked, residents suffering from stomach ulcers had a risk of absorbing the toxin through the stomach lining, offering a direct route to the bloodstream. Being similar to Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), <b>ergot</b> would not survive in the acidic environment of a typical human's stomach, especially in properly cooked food. [...] But if some but not all residents were malnourished and suffering from bleeding stomach ulcers, only they could be affected by ingesting contaminated grains, leaving the majority unaffected, explaining why ergotism was not previously recognized. [...] Harrier argued that the numbers could have been larger, possibly including the entire town, but due to the trials on bewitchment and heresy, {{and the fear of}} being accused and subsequently executed, few could come forward while suffering from legitimate medical conditions.|$|E
