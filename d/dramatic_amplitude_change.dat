Both intracavitary electrocardiography guided tip location and X-ray positioning were used to verify catheter tip locations in patients undergoing central venous catheter insertion. Intracavitary electrocardiograms from 1119 patients (of a total 1160 subjects) showed specific <b>amplitude</b> <b>changes</b> in the P-wave. As the results show, compared with X-ray positioning, the sensitivity of electrocardiography-guided tip location was 97. 3 %, with false negative rate of 2. 7 %; the specificity was 1, with false positive rate of zero. Univariate analyses indicated that features including age, gender, height, body weight, and heart rate have no statistically significant influence on P-wave <b>amplitude</b> <b>changes</b> (P > 0. 05). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that catheter insertion routes (OR = 2. 280, P = 0. 003) and basal P-wave amplitude (OR = 0. 553, P = 0. 003) have statistically significant impacts on P-wave <b>amplitude</b> <b>changes.</b> As a reliable indicator of tip location, <b>amplitude</b> <b>change</b> in the P-wave has proved of good sensitivity and excellent specificity, and the minor, zero, false positive rate supports the clinical utility of this technique in early recognition of malpositioned tips.

Although this change increased {{with the number of}} diseased coronary arteries, the difference between 1 -vessel and multi- or 3 -vessel disease was not significant.

40|$|AbstractBioluminescence rhythms from {{cellular}} {{reporters have}} become the most common method used to quantify oscillations in circadian gene expression. These experimental systems can reveal phase and <b>amplitude</b> <b>change</b> resulting from circadian disturbances, {{and can be used}} in conjunction with mathematical models to lend further insight into the mechanistic basis of clock amplitude regulation. However, bioluminescence experiments track the mean output from thousands of noisy, uncoupled oscillators, obscuring the direct effect of a given stimulus on the genetic regulatory network. In many cases, it is unclear whether <b>changes</b> in <b>amplitude</b> are due to individual changes in gene expression level or to a change in coherence of the population. Although such systems can be modeled using explicit stochastic simulations, these models are computationally cumbersome and limit analytical insight into the mechanisms of <b>amplitude</b> <b>change.</b> We therefore develop theoretical and computational tools to approximate the mean expression level in large populations of noninteracting oscillators, and further define computationally efficient amplitude response calculations to describe phase-dependent <b>amplitude</b> <b>change.</b> At the single-cell level, a mechanistic nonlinear ordinary differential equation model is used to calculate the transient response of each cell to a perturbation, whereas population-level dynamics are captured by coupling this detailed model to a phase density function. Our analysis reveals that <b>amplitude</b> <b>changes</b> mediated at either the individual-cell or the population level can be distinguished in tissue-level bioluminescence data without the need for single-cell measurements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by modeling experimental bioluminescence profiles of light-sensitive fibroblasts, reconciling the conclusions of two seemingly contradictory studies. This modeling framework allows a direct comparison between in vitro bioluminescence experiments and in silico ordinary differential equation models, and will lead to a better quantitative understanding of the factors that affect clock amplitude...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} electromyography (EMG) <b>amplitude</b> and latency <b>changes</b> during tube dislocation in monitored thyroid surgery, which may be observed without recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. Methods Duroc-Landrace piglets were intubated with the TriVantage EMG tube. We measured EMG changes during both upward and downward tube dislocation (10 - 20 mm) and rotation (45 - 90 °) with continuous neuromonitoring. Results The EMG amplitude varied significantly with induced endotracheal tube rotation and depth changes. However, the EMG latency was relatively unaffected by such tube dislocation, just a transient artifactual latency change was observed in the situation of extreme amplitude variation. Conclusion <b>Amplitude</b> <b>changes</b> without latency changes may be due to changes in tube position alone during surgery, but could still reflect a neurophysiologic event; <b>amplitude</b> <b>changes</b> during neuropraxic injury merit additional investigation.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixteen type 1 Brugada syndrome patients implanted with a St Jude Medical AnalyST(®) ICD were enrolled and underwent ajmaline challenge. Intracardiac electrograms and 12 lead ECG signals were collected over the duration of the study and analysed off-line. The right precordial ECG leads were in both the third and fourth intercostal space by putting V 5 and V 6 in V 1 and V 2 at the third intercostal space. Two patients were excluded from the analysis due to signal noise issues. Of the remaining 14 patients, 12 and 2 patients were adjudicated to have positive and negative ajmaline challenges, respectively, based on standard ECG criteria. In the ajmaline positive patients, the IEGM T wave <b>amplitude</b> <b>changes</b> were more prominent than those of the IEGM ST segment (- 898 ± 463 vs. - 55 ± 381 µV, P 0. 05). Furthermore, all of these T wave <b>amplitude</b> <b>changes</b> were in the negative polarity, whereas the change in polarity of the ST segment was mixed.
