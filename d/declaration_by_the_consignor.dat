It is shown {{that the level of}} differentiation is determined <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>consignor's</b> bargaining power and the ratio of the transport rates between the final product and the subcontracted input. Furthermore, the paper finds that part of the results obtained under horizontal product differentiation are not reproduced in a vertical product context. Copyright (c) 2009 the author(s).
