25|$|Supercritical drying is {{a method}} of {{removing}} solvent without surface tension effects. As a liquid dries, the surface tension <b>drags</b> <b>on</b> small structures within a solid, causing distortion and shrinkage. Under supercritical conditions there is no surface tension, and the supercritical fluid can be removed without distortion. Supercritical drying is used for manufacture of aerogels and drying of delicate materials such as archeological samples and biological samples for electron microscopy. Carbon Dioxide {{is used as a}} supercritical solvent in some dry cleaning processes.|$|E

25|$|They {{find that}} a large party has {{assembled}} at his home and that the champagne is already flowing. Present are Lebedyev, his daughter Vera, Ippolit, Burdovsky, Kolya, General Ivolgin, Ganya, Ptitsyn, Ferdyschenko, Keller, and, to Myshkin's surprise, Yevgeny Pavlovich, who has come to ask for his friendship and advice. The guests greet the Prince warmly and compete for his attention. Stimulated by Lebedyev's eloquence, everyone engages for some time in intelligent and inebriated disputation on lofty subjects, but the good-humoured atmosphere begins to dissipate when Ippolit suddenly produces a large red-sealed envelope and announces that it contains an essay he has written which he now intends to read to them. The essay {{is a series of}} verbose psychological observations on the subject of his own approaching death, written in a defiant, self-conscious style, and culminating in the announcement that, rather than go on living for a few more weeks, he will be shooting himself at sunrise. The reading <b>drags</b> <b>on</b> for over an hour and by its end, the sun has risen. Most of his audience, however, is bored and resentful, apparently not at all concerned that he is about to shoot himself. Only Vera, Kolya, Burdovsky and Keller seek to restrain him. He distracts them by pretending to abandon the plan, then suddenly pulls out a small pistol, puts it to his temple and pulls the trigger. There is a click but no shot: Ippolit faints but is not killed. It turns out, to the great amusement of some, that he had taken out the cap earlier and forgotten to put it back in. Ippolit is devastated and tries desperately to convince everyone that it was an accident. Eventually, he falls asleep and the party disperses.|$|E
500|$|In {{the days}} before the election, Underwood pushes Congress to {{formally}} declare war on ICO, and orders the CIA to kill one of the terrorists and make it look like he had died fleeing capture. Underwood still lags in the polls, however, and on election night it appears he is going to lose to Conway. With help from Stamper and campaign strategist LeAnn Harvey (Neve Campbell), Underwood has NSA contractor Aidan Macallan (Damian Young) stage a cyberattack on several election stations. He also uses the fear of a possible terrorist attack to pressure the governors of Tennessee and Ohio to halt voting. The tactics work; the two states refuse to declare a winner, and the election <b>drags</b> <b>on</b> unresolved for several weeks.|$|E
500|$|In Puzzlejuice, {{the player}} turns falling tetrominos into letters, and those letters into words and points. The player taps and <b>drags</b> <b>on</b> the {{touchscreen}} to rotate and position multicolored tetrominos that {{fall from the}} top of the screen. When the player completes a solid row of tiles, or arranges the fallen blocks such that four or more like-colored tiles touch, the color tiles turn into letters. Players connect these letter tiles with their eight adjacent tiles (in ordinal directions) to make words. Words of sufficient length are cleared from play as well as their adjacent tiles—thus longer words clear more blocks. The iPhone version shows a magnified version of the tile obscured by the player's finger near the finger. The game has been compared to a cross between Boggle, Tetris, and tile-matching.|$|E

500|$|The divine {{struggle}} involves many episodes. [...] "Contendings" [...] {{describes the}} two gods appealing to various other deities to arbitrate the dispute and competing {{in different types}} of contests, such as racing in boats or fighting {{each other in the}} form of hippopotami, to determine a victor. In this account, Horus repeatedly defeats Set and is supported by most of the other deities. Yet the dispute <b>drags</b> <b>on</b> for eighty years, largely because the judge, the creator god, favors Set. In late ritual texts, the conflict is characterized as a great battle involving the two deities' assembled followers. The strife in the divine realm extends beyond the two combatants. At one point Isis attempts to harpoon Set as he is locked in combat with her son, but she strikes Horus instead, who then cuts off her head in a fit of rage. Thoth replaces Isis's head with that of a cow; the story gives a mythical origin for the cow-horn headdress that Isis commonly wears.|$|E
500|$|Ross (David Schwimmer) and Carol (Jane Sibbett) {{inform the}} others that their son Ben (Jack and Charlie Allen) has an {{audition}} for a soup commercial, which Joey (Matt LeBlanc) finds hard to accept. When he learns that the TV commercial also has a part for the father, he volunteers himself for the audition. Both Joey and Ben are chosen for the callback but a lack of similarity in looks makes the director cast them with different individuals, therefore ensuring {{only one of them}} can be chosen for the commercial. Joey is paired up with a famous child actor. He talks to Ross about the callback in an attempt to make Ben back out of the audition which Ross finds unreasonable as it was Ben's audition in the first place, and Joey just invited himself along. Both end up fighting over it, which <b>drags</b> <b>on</b> until the callback is held. Joey messes up his two-word line: [...] "mmm soup", ultimately losing him the part. Ross consoles him, informing him later that Ben also didn't get the part.|$|E

The president of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, Jasper Tsang, said: [...] "the China Central Television (CCTV) report [...] {{did not seem to be}} able to calm the public. As the case <b>drags</b> <b>on,</b> there will be more speculation". Human Rights Watch was quoted as saying: [...] "Given that Gui has been held nearly three months incommunicado, in a secret location, and without a lawyer, his confession on state-controlled TV lacks credibility". The Washington Post said: [...] "The narrative seems messy and incoherent, blending possible fact with what seems like outright fiction. It feels illogical, absurd even". Amnesty International’s China researcher cast doubt on the narrative, asking: [...] "Why would four other employees of a company need to go missing in order to assist with a regular criminal case? How could other missing or otherwise investigated colleagues of Gui Minhai have any connection to the case?" [...] The Guardian drew a connection to Operation Fox Hunt, a Chinese government campaign launched by Xi Jinping in 2014 to repatriate corrupt officials or opponents of the regime who had fled abroad, and which may also have been responsible for the abduction of the other missing booksellers. By mid-June 2016, Gui's family had not yet received official confirmation that he was under detention, according to Gui's daughter.|$|E

500|$|Book Eight, War of the Asuras, {{is set in}} the 20th century, {{during the}} [...] "Long War". The world has become divided into three large alliances, the Chinese Empire and its colonies, the {{fractured}} Muslim world (Dar al-Islam), and the democratic Indian and Hodenosaunee Leagues. At the outbreak of war the Muslim states put aside their differences and unite to flight the larger threat of China (whom they fear will soon achieve global hegemony). The Indian and Hodenosaunee Leagues stay neutral at first, but eventually ally with China, as they see the Muslims as their greater enemy, however the Muslims invade northern India {{all the way down to}} Burma to stop the Indians and Chinese from linking up. The war <b>drags</b> <b>on</b> for decades causing major changes in the societies involved, with rapid industrialisation, mass conscription and mass casualties (both sides are forced to use women in the fighting to make up for manpower losses). Being the first industrial war, new devastating weapons and methods are employed, such as trench warfare, poison gas and aerial bombing. The story follows Chinese officers, Kuo, Bai and Iwa as they desperately fight in the trenches of the Gansu Corridor, where the ground has been blasted down to bedrock by sixty years of bombardments (the latest massive artillery pieces lob shells into space on ballistic trajectories). The new Chinese government, the [...] "Fourth Assemblage of Military Talent" [...] (the Qing Dynasty having been overthrown by a military coup during the war) orders a new offensive against the Muslim lines in Gansu. Kuo, Bai and Iwa are told to use poison gas and then frontally assault the enemy trenches. They do this successfully, but are then beaten back by the second line of Muslim defences, losing tens of thousands of soldiers and gaining nothing. However they are then told that their attack was merely a diversion for the real offensive which is being conducted by the Japanese (who have recently been freed by China in exchange for alliance in the war) through Siberia. The Muslims are in retreat but the Japanese get bogged down at the Ural Mountains. In the meantime, Kuo is killed by a shell which penetrates their bunker, Bai and Iwa are then ordered to move with their company south through Tibet to support their Indian allies. At a pass in the Himalayas they witness the Muslim artillery blasting the top of Mount Everest down so that the tallest mountain in the world will be in Muslim lands. After extreme difficulties they manage to breach the Muslim defences at the pass and the Chinese army pours through to meet up with the Indians, turning the course of the war in their favour. However Bai is plagued by visions of his dead friend Kuo, who tells him that none of this is happening and that he is already dead, killed by the shell earlier. Bai does not know whether he is indeed living real life or is already in the afterlife.|$|E

We were introduced to a set of people in whom it is impossible to take an interest, and were made familiar with transactions that suggested horror. The great master of fiction exhibited all his skill, performed the most wonderful feats of language, loaded his page with wit and many a fine touch peculiar to himself. The agility of his pen was amazing, but still at first we were not much amused." [...] Despite the mixed review, it pleased Dickens so well that he gave Dallas the manuscript.|$|E

2500|$|Teams of {{scientists}} studying studying [...] {{to build the}} Tree of Life assemble large spreadsheets of observations about species (referred to as [...] "matrices"). These teams require simultaneous access by each team member to a single and secure copy of the team's data during a scientific research project. This single copy of the data also changes with great frequency {{during the data collection}} phase. Images that can be very helpful for documenting homology statements must be displayed, labeled and shared as homology statements develop. This cannot be accomplished elegantly with a desktop software package alone because in a desktop environment each collaborator is working on his own private copy of project data. Changes made by one participant cannot automatically propagate to others, preventing collaborators from seeing each other's data edits until they are manually (and due to the effort involved, often only periodically) merged into a single [...] "true" [...] dataset.

2500|$|During {{the third}} week of the dispute, the union and HIT both engaged in war of words in the press. HIT took out full page {{advertisements}} in almost all local newspapers on 20 April, except the anti-government Apple Daily, not merely defending itself but making personal attacks on Lee Cheuk-yan claiming he is using the workers to further his own political ends. HIT's advertisement in the English-language press said union demands for a 20 percent raise would [...] "create an impact across other industries and cause irreparable damage to Hong Kong." [...] Canning Fok, managing director of the Hutchsion Whampoa group, publicly alleged that Lee Cheuk-yan was not genuinely interested in helping the workers and harboured ulterior motives. He criticised Lee for [...] "resort to every means ... hoping that as the strike <b>drags</b> <b>on,</b> he can negotiate with Mr Li so as to boost his own publicity." [...] Fok likened the style of the dispute to the Cultural Revolution, [...] "where people are vilified on banners and posters".

[...] Workers took out advertising space in Ming Pao Daily with a headline suggesting that KS Li did not really understands their situation.|$|E

The two wrestled what was described as a [...] "sensational" [...] match, focusing on the high flying offense of both competitors. In the end Mr. Águila was able to execute his [...] "Destroyer" [...] finishing move (Front flip piledriver) to take the victory in eight minutes and two seconds. In the semi-final match two thirds of the CMLL World Tag Team Champions El Bufete del Amor (Marco Corleone and Maximo) teamed up with Maximo's father Brazo de Oro. Brazo de Oro replaced their regular partner Rush who at the time was in Japan competing in New Japan Pro Wrestling's 2012 World Tag League tournament. The trio took on the rudo team known as Los Hijos del Averno ("The sons of Hell"; Averno, Mephisto and Ephesto). During the match Brazo de Plata showed off the fact that his massive weight loss led him to be more athletic, including performing high speed Arm <b>drags</b> <b>on</b> his opponents. The tecnico team took the third fall when Brazo de Plata dove off the second rope, splashing both Ephesto and Mephisto to get the double pinfall. In the main event former CMLL World Tag Team Champion Atlantis teamed up with La Sombra and Shocker to face the team that defeated Atlantis and Diamante Azul to win the titles El Terrible and Tama Tonga and Terrible's [...] team mate Tiger. During the match the high flying La Sombra and Tiger had several heated exchanges, counters and high flying moves to the enjoyment of the audience. The rudos focused most of their attention on Atlantis, including trying to tear his mask apart, as well as double teaming him throughout the match. The third fall went to Atlantis' team when he forced Tiger to submit while Shocker pinned Tama Tonga at the same time.|$|E
