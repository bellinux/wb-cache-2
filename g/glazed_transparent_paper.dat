40|$|The present work {{focuses on}} the archaeometric {{characterisation}} of 10 th- 11 th-century lead-glazed pottery from Nogara (Verona, north-east Italy), with the main aim of defining the production technology of both glaze and clay body, through a multi-methodological approach. All the <b>glazes,</b> <b>transparent</b> and yellow to green in colour, are 20 to 100 μm thick, texturally homogeneous and variable in composition, with high lead content (PbO: 53 - 76 wt...|$|R
50|$|Coronato {{begins by}} {{texturing}} a board with thick gesso. Multiple layers of acrylic paint are applied, {{and on top}} of the acrylic goes the silk screened line work. Layers of translucent oil paint are slowly built up. Oil can create fine <b>glazes,</b> <b>transparent</b> and slow to dry. As each layer builds up, they create effects of light and texture not possible with other painting techniques. This glazing technique is very {{similar to that of the}} artists of the Italian Renaissance, giving the paint a luminous quality.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Solar cell {{substrates}} require high optical transparency {{but also}} prefer high optical haze {{to increase the}} light scattering and consequently the absorption in the active materials. Unfortunately, there is a trade-off between these optical properties, which is exemplified by common trans-parent paper substrates exhibiting a transparency of about 90 % yet a low optical haze (< 20 %). In this work, we introduce a novel <b>transparent</b> <b>paper</b> made of wood fibers that displays both ultrahigh optical transparency (∼ 96 %) and ultrahigh haze (∼ 60 %), thus delivering an optimal substrate design for solar cell devices. Compared to previously demonstrated nanopaper composed of wood-based cellulose nanofibers, our novel <b>transparent</b> <b>paper</b> has better dual performance in transmittance and haze but also is fabricated {{at a much lower}} cost. This high-performance, low-cost <b>transparent</b> <b>paper</b> is a potentially revolutionary material that may influence a new generation of environmentally friendly printed electronics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{integrated}} collector {{water storage}} (ICWS) systems are simple type {{solar water heaters}} {{that can be used}} for the supply of hot water for domestic purposes, as alternative devices to the well known flat plate thermos phonic units (FPTU). Thermal protection of storage tanks is less effective in ICWS systems compared to FPTU systems and several methods are suggested to keep water temperature at a satisfactory level. Among them, the use of a selective absorber that reduces radiation thermal losses and double <b>glazing,</b> <b>transparent</b> insulation and inverted or evacuated absorber to suppress convection thermal losses, are suggested methods that preserve water storage heat. The use of compound parabolic collector (CPC) sym metric reflectors can result in ICS solar systems with effective water heating by using the non-uniform distribution of solar radiation on the cylindrical absorber surface...|$|R

40|$|Kakiemon-style porcelains {{produced}} at Arita areas (SAGA) in Kyushu Island are famous Japanese porcelains. The porcelain-techniques creating its elegant and bright red-color underglaze and overglaze were found and developed in 1650 's (early Edo period) first by Kakiemon kiln. Red-color overglaze and <b>transparent</b> <b>glaze</b> of the Kakiemon-style porcelains {{have been investigated}} by means of X-ray diffraction using synchrotron radiation. The {{results suggest that the}} red-color brightness is mainly induced by micro-structural correlation between &# 945;-Fe 2 O 3 fine particles, as red-color emission elements, and other oxides of SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, CaO, KNaO, PbO. The stability of the red-overglaze on the porcelain surface is related to interfacial fusion of the glasses existing in the fritted red-overglaze and the <b>transparent</b> <b>glaze</b> on the porcelain body. The ancient porcelain-techniques of the Kakiemon-style porcelains are clearly based on the micro-structural and material properties of the overglazes, the underglazes, and the <b>transparent</b> <b>glazes,</b> though the techniques were experimentally and accidentally found and developed in the Edo period...|$|R

In order to find out secret image, participants print shadow images to <b>transparent</b> <b>papers.</b> Then, a secret image will appear as stacking <b>transparent</b> <b>papers.</b> The secret sharing scheme in this paper distribute secret image into natural grayscale images using multiplexer and data hiding scheme. After then, two participant have two shadow images respectively. The merit of the proposed scheme is that shadow images have small loss in aspect of the quality with steganographic features. Therefore, the proposed secret sharing scheme in this paper is not easily detected by attackers. The experiment result verified that the proposed scheme, obviously outperforms previous S...|$|R
