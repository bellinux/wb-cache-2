5|$|By 1913, {{the revival}} at Azusa Street had lost momentum, {{and most of}} the media {{attention}} and crowds had left by 1915. Seymour remained there with his wife, Jennie, {{for the rest of their}} lives as pastors of the small African American congregation, though he often made short trips to <b>help</b> <b>establish</b> other smaller revivals later in life. After Seymour died of a heart attack on September 28, 1922, Jennie led the church until 1931, when the congregation lost the building.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{symptoms}} of low mood and energy, individuals with depression may {{be likely to}} have behaviors that are counter to good sleep hygiene, such as taking naps during the day, consuming alcohol near bedtime, and consuming large amounts of caffeine during the day. In addition to sleep hygiene education, bright light therapy can be a useful treatment for individuals with depression. Not only can morning bright light therapy <b>help</b> <b>establish</b> a better sleep-wake schedule, {{but it also has}} been shown to be effective for treating depression directly, especially when related to seasonal affective disorder.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} of the Umayyad conquest of Hispania and {{throughout}} the Reconquista, marriage between Spanish and Umayyad royals was not uncommon. Early marriages, such as that of Abd al-Aziz ibn Musa and Egilona {{at the turn of the}} 8th century, was thought to <b>help</b> <b>establish</b> the legitimacy of Muslim rule on the Iberian Peninsula. Later instances of intermarriage were often made to seal trade treaties between Christian kings and Muslim caliphs.|$|E

5|$|Since 1923, Macaulay had run a cricket outfitters in Leeds and Wakefield {{with his}} Yorkshire team-mate Herbert Sutcliffe, {{borrowing}} £250 {{from his mother}} to <b>help</b> <b>establish</b> the business. During the winter of 1924–25, the shop became a limited company and Macaulay one of its directors. According to Sutcliffe's biographer Alan Hill, Macaulay quickly lost interest, and the partnership was dissolved a year later, but Sutcliffe made the lone venture a success. Macaulay received £900 from the outfitters upon his resignation.|$|E
5|$|When Bill Watts {{was ousted}} from his {{position}} in WCW in favor of Eric Bischoff, Eaton was rehired. Once back on the roster, Eaton teamed up with a young Chris Benoit in Benoit's first stint with WCW. Together they were mainly used to <b>help</b> <b>establish</b> rising teams or give established teams opposition. Benoit and Eaton, while gelling in the ring, never showed any signs of being presented as a permanent team; {{they did not have}} matching ring outfits or a team name.|$|E
5|$|After Arthur's {{death in}} January 1943, Ninah Cummer began {{collecting}} art in earnest. During the fifteen years before her death, Ninah expanded her art collection to sixty pieces, {{all of which}} are still in the Museum’s collection today. In 1957, the year before her death, Ninah announced that her gifts would “make only a small beginning toward a large vision” and hoped “that others will share this vision and by their interest and contributions will <b>help</b> <b>establish</b> here a center of beauty and culture worthy of the community.” She created the DeEtte Holden Cummer Museum Foundation, named for the deceased infant daughter of the Cummers, to manage her vision after her death.|$|E

5|$|After {{arriving}} in the Middle East, the 2/2nd Machine Gun Battalion conducted more training in Palestine until April 1941 when it was transported to Mersa Matruh, where the battalion began a year-long period serving in the garrison role. Towards {{the end of this}} period– January 1942– the battalion was reassigned to the 9th Division and moved to Syria where it undertook further garrison duty as part of the Allied occupation force that had been established after the Syria–Lebanon campaign to defend against a possible German attack across the Caucasus Mountains. This came to an end in late June 1942 when the 9th was rushed to El Alamein to <b>help</b> <b>establish</b> a hasty defence line.|$|E
5|$|After the {{departure}} of Bligh's launch, Christian turned Bounty eastward {{in search of a}} remote haven on which he and the mutineers could settle. He had in mind the island of Tubuai, 300miles south of Tahiti, partly mapped by Cook. Christian intended to pick up women, male servants and livestock from Tahiti, to <b>help</b> <b>establish</b> the settlement. As Bounty sailed slowly towards Tubuai, Bligh's launch, overcoming many dangers and hardships, made its way steadily towards civilisation and reached Coupang (now Kupang), on Timor, on 14 June 1789. Here Bligh gave his first report of the mutiny, while awaiting a ship to take him back to England.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{collections}} {{have been}} useful for retrospective studies. Bird collections offer {{the potential for}} current and future researchers to make in-depth morphological and molecular study of past avian diversity. One of the earliest and most famous examples of this {{was the use of}} egg collections from the 19th and early 20th centuries in determining that the pesticide DDT was producing eggshell-thinning in raptors. The ornithologists who collected the eggs could never have known that their work would one day <b>help</b> <b>establish</b> causes for declines and help in making conservation strategies to save bird such as peregrine falcons from possible extinction.|$|E

5|$|Gillard {{worked in}} the {{industrial}} department of the law firm Slater & Gordon from 1988 through to 1995. In the early 1990s, {{she was in a}} relationship with Bruce Wilson, an official of the Australian Workers' Union (AWU). Gillard provided pro-bono legal assistance to <b>help</b> <b>establish</b> the AWU Workplace Reform Association for Wilson and his associate Ralph Blewitt. She was also involved in providing legal services in relation to the purchase of a Fitzroy property by Wilson and Blewitt. Wilson and Blewitt have been accused of creating the association in order to use a slush fund for personal benefit, including diverting funds for the purchase of the house in Fitzroy.|$|E
5|$|In 1918 Whitehead's {{academic}} responsibilities {{began to}} seriously expand as he accepted {{a number of}} high administrative positions within the University of London system, of which Imperial College London was a member at the time. He was elected dean of the Faculty of Science at the University of London in late 1918 (a post he held for four years), {{a member of the}} University of London's Senate in 1919, and chairman of the Senate's Academic (leadership) Council in 1920, a post which he held until he departed for America in 1924. Whitehead was able to exert his newfound influence to successfully lobby for a new history of science department, <b>help</b> <b>establish</b> a Bachelor of Science degree (previously only Bachelor of Arts degrees had been offered), and make the school more accessible to less wealthy students.|$|E
5|$|The Persian polymath Avicenna {{claimed to}} have {{observed}} Venus as {{a spot on the}} Sun. This is possible, as there was a transit on May 24, 1032, but Avicenna did not give the date of his observation, and modern scholars have questioned whether he could have observed the transit from his location at that time; he may have mistaken a sunspot for Venus. He used his transit observation to <b>help</b> <b>establish</b> that Venus was, at least sometimes, below the Sun in Ptolemaic cosmology, i.e. the sphere of Venus comes before the sphere of the Sun when moving out from the Earth in the prevailing geocentric model.|$|E

5|$|As Minton grew older, he was {{frequently}} {{in trouble with}} the people in his neighborhood. In 1904, he was arrested for disregarding a town ordinance forbidding bicyclists to ride on the sidewalk. He was taken before a justice of the peace and fined three dollars, an incident he later credited with changing his outlook on life and sparking his desire to become a lawyer. To accomplish that goal, and continue supporting his family, he traveled with his older brother Herbert to Fort Worth, Texas, to take a job at the Swift and Company meat packing plant. His father and younger siblings soon joined him in Texas after the two brothers' income was able to cover their expenses. After saving enough money to <b>help</b> <b>establish</b> the family in a new home, Minton returned to Indiana to attend high school, leaving his family in Texas.|$|E
5|$|Gascoigne {{was then}} given a {{significant}} opportunity {{that became the}} focus of the remainder of his paid academic career: to <b>help</b> <b>establish</b> one of the world's largest optical telescopes, at Siding Spring. In the early 1960s, the Australian and British governments proposed a partnership to build a joint optical telescope facility, and Gascoigne was among the experts involved. Former Mount Stromlo director and now head of the Greenwich observatory, Richard Woolley, was prominent in supporting the project from the British end. In 1967, the two governments formally agreed to collaborate on the construction of a large telescope, {{to be known as the}} Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT). Given the existing infrastructure of the ANU's Siding Spring Observatory, the site was readily agreed as the location for the AAT. Gascoigne was one of the four members of the Technical Committee established to guide the telescope's development. He provided leadership on the design and optics of the new telescope, and was made the chief commissioning astronomer in 1974.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} year, still seeking a league, the US-based North American Hockey League, which {{was looking to}} expand, was {{approached}} as a possibility. In an April 2009 announcement, they accepted the Dawson Creek franchise, {{which would be the}} only Canadian team in the league and the first since the Fernie Ghostriders left the league in 2004 to become a Junior B team. The ownership group agreed to pay the $400,000 franchise fee with the team entering the league for the 2010–11 season with 31 home games to be played in the Multiplex each season. The local government, the City of Dawson Creek, agreed to contribute $675,000 over 3 years to <b>help</b> <b>establish</b> the team as a reliable tenant for the Multiplex which was operating at a loss {{due to the lack of}} events. The team, now known as the Dawson Creek Rage, selected Scott Robinson, a former BCHL coach of the year, to lead the new team as its general manager and head coach. To recruit and evaluate potential players (aged 15–20), they held Spring 2010 try-out camps in Princeton, Abbotsford and Dawson Creek which attracted about 200 players.|$|E
