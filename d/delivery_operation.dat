40|$|Ongoing {{changes in}} {{business}} objectives increasingly result in implementation of different business strategies striving {{to improve the}} workers’ performance. In that context, variable pay schemes have been utilised to increase employees’ motivation and productivity. Unlike the sales and warehouse sector, {{a number of issues}} emerge with respect to the variable pay schemes in <b>delivery</b> <b>operations.</b> The paper aims to examine issues and challenges associated with the introduction of variable pay schemes in the field of <b>delivery</b> <b>operations.</b> In this paper, we illustrate and analyse a case study from <b>delivery</b> <b>operations</b> of the FMCG sector in the market of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In this sense, the paper addresses the following research questions: What is the intended purpose of variable pay schemes? Which variables affect <b>delivery</b> <b>operations?</b> Why <b>delivery</b> performance should be carefully monitored? Which external factors influence delivery driver productivity? Can variable pay schemes attract, motivate or retain employees? Can variable pay schemes really work in <b>delivery</b> <b>operations?</b> The discussion presented in the paper has important practical implications related to workforce management and may be useful to managers and other subjects involved in designing pay and reward structures...|$|R

500|$|Although {{the music}} video aspect of Yankovic's songs {{had long been}} a part of his success, RCA Records opted not to fund any video {{production}} for Mandatory Fun. Yankovic instead turned to various social media portals including Funny or Die and CollegeHumor which he had worked with in the past; these sites helped to cover the production cost of the videos with Yankovic foregoing any video ad revenue. He chose to distribute the videos to different portals to avoid burdening any single one with all of the costs and work needed to produce them. This release strategy was considered by The Atlantic as a [...] "web-enabled precision video <b>delivery</b> <b>operation,</b> and evidence of some serious digital distributional forethought" [...] as it allows the videos to be seen by different sets of audiences for each site.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} the cost of allowing customers to choose certain delivery time windows, we use the modelling approach of Moons et al. [9]. The authors propose an integrated planning approach for order picking and vehicle routing. Traditionally order picking and delivery decisions are decided in an uncoordinated way. B 2 C e-commerce companies often outsource their <b>delivery</b> <b>operations</b> to a 3 PL service operator. Every day, the 3 PL operator picks up the goods at the DC at a fixed time, mostly in the evening. Based on the pickup time, the e-commerce company determines a cut-off time. All goods ordered before this cut-off time are picked before the 3 PL service provider arrives at the DC. In an integrated approach, the e-commerce company executes the <b>delivery</b> <b>operations</b> itself, or there is coordination between the e-commerce company and the 3 PL service provider. No fixed pickup times are implied anymore. By coordinating the order picking and distribution process and exchanging information, a vehicle can leave the DC whenever {{a sufficient number of}} orders to conduct a delivery route have been picked. As such, the start of the distribution process is more flexible. The picking and <b>delivery</b> <b>operations</b> overlap in time.|$|R
