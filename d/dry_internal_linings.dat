50|$|Although the {{interior}} of the building has been altered, the arrangement of spaces is essentially intact. The spaces in the tower comprise a series of small rooms with brick walls and arched brick openings. The spaces adjoining the tower on the lower two storeys are open plan with posts of various design. Parts of the second level floor have been removed to create new staircases and a void looking towards the new stage area. Much of the internal timber structure remains. This exposed timber structure consists of massive hardwood posts and beams with crude rounded capitals and trussed double gable roofs over the two storey section. Much of the <b>internal</b> <b>linings</b> are likely to be covered by later linings and joinery elements.|$|R

40|$|Gypsum {{plasterboard}} {{that incorporates}} various combinations of polyurethane foam waste and polypropylene fibers in its matrix is studied. The prefabricated material was characterized {{in a series}} of standardized tests: bulk density, maximum breaking load under flexion stress, total water absorption, surface hardness, thermal properties, and reaction to fire performance. Polypropylene fibers were added to the polyurethane gypsum composites to improve the mechanical behavior of the plasterboard under loading. The results indicate that increased quantities of polymer waste led to significant reductions in the weight/surface ratio, the mechanical strength and the surface hardness of the gypsum, as well as improving its thermal resistance. The polypropylene fibers showed good adhesion to the polymer and the gypsum matrix, which enhanced the mechanical performance and the absorption capacity of these compounds.

All other assemblies demonstrated ‘Good’ moisture buffer value. Moisture buffer values of the assemblies, after application of paint on the upper surfaces, were also determined. It was observed that application of synthetic pigment based trade paint could reduce the moisture buffer performance of the assembly consisting of hemp-lime and lime-plaster from ‘Excellent’ to ‘Good’ while between 61 and 69 % reduction of moisture buffer value was observed for the other assemblies. However, the reduced buffer values of the assemblies are still comparable with other moisture buffering building materials.

5000|$|The playshed is a {{symmetrical}} open timber structure, {{which is}} rectangular in plan. It has a gabled roof framed in large timber sections and clad in hand-split hardwood shingles. There is wide overhang {{on all four}} sides, leaving large gablets clad in weatherboard. There are metal ridge and hip cappings. The roof is supported on ten stop-chamferred square posts, about 140mm (6 inch) square, which are bolted to buddy posts of a similar size, all set into the ground. There is triangular strutting to these posts which is also stop-chamferred, but some are replaced and some are missing. There are 120mm. (5") square perimeter roof beams, and 190x70mm. (8"x3") tie-beams. Where the struts are missing, {{the quality of the}} workmanship is evident in the precision of the recessed housings.

40|$|Previous {{experimental}} investigations {{reported in}} the open literature have indicated that applying polyurea external coatings and/or <b>internal</b> <b>linings</b> can substantially improve ballistic penetration resistance and blast survivability of buildings, vehicles, and laboratory/field test-plates, {{as well as the}} blast-mitigation capacity of combat helmets. The protective role of polyurea coatings/linings has been linked to polyurea micro-structure, which consists of discrete hard-domains distributed randomly within a compliant/soft matrix. When this protective role is investigated computationally, the availability of reliable, high-fidelity consti-tutive models for polyurea is vitally important. In the present work, a comprehensive overview and a critical assessment of a polyurea material constitutive model, recently proposed by Shim and Mohr (Int J Plast 27 : 868 - 886, 2011), are carried out. The review revealed that this model can accurately account for the experimentally measured uniaxial-stress versus strain data obtained under monotonic and multistep compressive loading/unloading conditions, as well as under stress relaxation conditions. On the other hand, by combining analytical and finite-element procedures with the material model in order to define the basic shock-Hugoniot relations for this material, {{it was found that the}} computed shock-Hugoniot relations differ significantly from their experimental counterparts. Potential reasons for the disagreement between the computed and experimental shock-Hugoniot relations are identified.

40|$|For water {{injection}} pipelines {{used in the}} offshore industry and for steel and cast iron water supply pipelines in the water supply industry <b>internal</b> <b>linings</b> of polymer materials or cement have been and are being used {{in an attempt to}} reduce the internal corrosion of the pipeline. One common, medium term failure mechanism is the debonding of the liner from the steel or cast iron. The life of liners often {{has been found to be}} lower than expected where the liner was applied after earlier service and some corrosion of the bare pipeline, despite best efforts in surface cleaning and preparation prior to application of the liner. Some reasons based on experience have been given for the debonding process. The present paper proposes a mechanism for the initiation of the debonding process based on corrosion theory for the special case of very low oxygen availability. It shows that even if the liner is in good condition without pinholes or other defects and still is providing a high degree of diffusion protection against aggressive species in the water debonding of the liner in a pipeline can still occur. In particular, the theoretical reasons are given to show that under certain conditions debonding can initiate without the build-up of substantial oxidation products under the liner...|$|R
50|$|The first {{room at the}} westernmost end of the {{building}} {{is used as a}} laundry and the framing of the walls, and the roof as there is no ceiling, is visible here. The wall studs are housed or notched directly into the end rafter and there is a ridge beam and widely spaced battens. Openings have been made into the shared walls to allow Room Numbers 2, 3, 4 and 5 (refer sketch plan drawing below) to operate as a flat for the owner of the barracks building, containing bath, bed, and living rooms as well as a kitchen. The walls and ceilings of all twelve rooms in the barracks are clad in fibrous cement sheeting. Those on the northern and southern sides have timber cover strips. Those shared are single-skin, with exposed timber framing decorated with rounded cover strips, on each face. Any later openings between rooms have been kept within this framing grid, where the single horizontal rail is approximately 1.8 metres from the floor.

5000|$|Ductile {{iron pipe}} is a pipe made of {{ductile cast iron}} {{commonly}} used for potable water transmission and distribution. This type of pipe is a direct development of earlier cast iron pipe, which it has superseded. The ductile iron used to manufacture the pipe {{is characterized by the}} spheroidal or nodular nature of the graphite within the iron. Typically, the pipe is manufactured using centrifugal casting in metal or resin lined moulds. Protective <b>internal</b> <b>linings</b> and external coatings are often applied to ductile iron pipes to inhibit corrosion: the standard internal lining is cement mortar and standard external coatings include bonded zinc, asphalt or water-based paint. In highly corrosive environments loose polyethylene sleeving (LPS) to encase the pipe may also be used. Life expectancy of unprotected ductile iron pipes depends on the corrosiveness of soil present and tends to be shorter where soil is highly corrosive. However, a lifespan in excess of 100 years has been estimated for ductile iron pipelines installed using [...] "evolved laying practices", including use of properly installed LPS (polyethylene encasement). [...] Studies of ductile iron pipe's environmental impact have differing findings regarding emissions and energy consumed. Ductile iron pipe manufactured in the United States has been certified as a sustainable product by the Institute for Market Transformation to Sustainability.|$|R

40|$|Polyurea is an {{elastomeric}} co-polymer {{in which}} the presence of strong hydrogen bonding between chains {{gives rise to the}} formation of a nano-composite like microstructure consisting of discrete hard-domains distributed randomly within a compliant/soft matrix. Several experimental investigations reported in the open literature have indicated that the application of polyurea external coatings and/or <b>internal</b> <b>linings</b> can substantially improve ballistic penetration resistance and blast survivability of buildings, vehicles and laboratory/field test-plates. Recently, it was proposed that transition of polyurea between its rubbery state and its glassy state under high deformation-rate loading conditions is the main mechanism responsible for the improved ballistic-impact resistance of polyurea-coated structures. As far as the shock-mitigation performance of polyurea is concerned, additional/alternative mechanisms such as shock-impedance mis-match, shock-wave dispersion, fracture-mode conversion, and strain delocalization have been suggested (without validation). In this study, an attempt is made to identify the phenomena and processes within polyurea which are most likely responsible for the observed superior shock-mitigation performance of this material. Towards that end, computational methods and tools are used to investigate shockwave generation, propagation, dispersion, and transmission/reflection within polyurea and the adjoining material layers as present {{in the case of a}} blast-loaded assembly consisting of a head covered with a polyurea-augmented helmet. The results obtained show that for effective shock mitigation, the operation of volumetric energy-dissipating/energy-storing processes is required. Candidate processes of this type are identified and presented...|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{modelling}} {{of coastal}} zone dynamics provides basis for solving {{a wide range}} of hydrogeological, engineering and ecological problems. A novel three-dimensional unstructured-mesh model is applied to simulate the dynamics of the density field and turbulence characteristics. The model is based on a finite-volume discretization and works on mixed unstructured meshes composed of triangles and quads. Although triangular meshes are most flexible geometrically, quads are more efficient numerically and do not support spurious inertial modes of triangular cell-vertex discretization. Mixed meshes composed of triangles and quads combine benefits of both. In particular, triangular transitional zones can be used to join quadrilateral meshes of differing resolution.
