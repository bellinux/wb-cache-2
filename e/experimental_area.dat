25|$|One {{problem was}} that the {{experimental}} chamber {{took a long time to}} refit for another shot, longer than the time needed to cool down the lasers. In order to improve utilization of the laser, a second experimental chamber was built behind the original, with optics that combined the ten beamlines into two. Nova had been built up against the older Shiva buildings, with the two experimental chambers back to back and the beamlines extending outward from the center target areas. The Two Beam system was installed by passing the beamguides and related optics through the now unused Shiva <b>experimental</b> <b>area</b> and placing the smaller experimental chamber in Shiva's beam bay.|$|E
500|$|In 1970 the Somerset Wildlife Trust {{bought the}} first part of the last [...] of acid raised bog {{vegetation}} left on the Somerset Moors undamaged by peat digging or agriculture. Since then SWT have bought or been given 100 hectares of former peatworkings. These were sculpted and restored to wetland as the <b>experimental</b> <b>area</b> for the Avalon Marshes. [...] This was the term given in the late 1980s to describe the wetland restored from peat workings in the Brue Valley. The wetland on the clay is dominated by Phragmites reed, catstail and open water. The wetland restoration has been a great success and was declared a National Nature Reserve in 1995. Peat working is now beginning to draw to a close on Westhay Moor and the majority of the remaining peatworkings are now being restored to wetland as they are completed. In 2014 two land owners unsuccessfully appealed against changes in planning permission which removed their rights to dig peat from Westhay Moor.|$|E

5000|$|The HASYLAB (Hamburger Synchrotronstrahlungslabor, [...] "Hamburg Synchrotron {{radiation}} Laboratory") is {{used for}} research with synchrotron radiation at DESY. It was opened in 1980 with 15 <b>experimental</b> <b>areas</b> (today there are 42). The laboratory adjoins to the storage ring DORIS {{in order to be}} able to use the generated synchrotron radiation for its research. While in the beginning DORIS served only one third of the time as a radiation source for HASYLAB, since 1993 all its running time is available for experiments with synchrotron radiation.

30|$|The {{experiment}} was performed at three different locations in Koriyama, Fukushima, Japan. All the <b>experimental</b> <b>areas</b> were asphalt pavements {{that had been}} previously decontaminated. The surface radiation doses were therefore sufficiently {{lower than those of}} un-decontaminated areas. The previous decontaminations had been done by high-pressure washing. As explained earlier, although the radioactive substances had been removed {{from the surface of the}} <b>experimental</b> <b>areas,</b> they were still present in the pores.|$|R

Unlike the uniform, tight rows of {{buildings}} of Gorky Street, Dorogomilovo road {{was lined with}} very different buildings, with wide spaces between them. It was an <b>experimental</b> <b>area</b> for Burov, Rosenfeld and other young architects. These buildings were not as thoroughly engineered as on Tverskaya and wooden ceilings and partitions and wet-stucco exteriors eventually resulted in greater maintenance costs.

2500|$|The foil shells, or hohlraums, are {{generally}} formed as small open-ended cylinders, with the laser arranged to shine {{in the open}} ends at an oblique angle in order to strike the inner surface. In order to support the indirect drive research at Nova, a second <b>experimental</b> <b>area</b> was built [...] "past" [...] the main one, opposite the laser bay. The system was arranged to focus all ten beams into two sets of five each, which passed into this second area and then into {{either end of the}} target chamber, and from there into the hohlraums.|$|E
40|$|We contrasted nest {{success for}} control <b>areas</b> and <b>experimental</b> <b>areas</b> in eastern North Dakota where we {{employed}} professionals to trap mammalian nest predators from late March to late July. In 1995, dabbling ducks averaged 53 % nest success on four treatment blocks of 4, 150 ha each; whereas on four control areas upland nesting ducks averaged 24 % success. Diving duck nest success averaged 57 % on <b>experimental</b> <b>areas</b> and 29 % on control areas. American coot (Fulica americana) nest success also improved on <b>experimental</b> <b>areas,</b> but blackbird nesting and fledging success were {{not affected by}} the treatment. In 1994, nest success of upland cresting ducks was 52 %, which was a striking contrast with upland nest success of 6 % on the control area. In 1994 and 1995, brood counts were much higher on the <b>experimental</b> <b>areas</b> than on the control areas. Track counts revealed lower estimates of predator activity on experimental sites compared to control sites. This study provides the first strong experimental documentation that trapping, {{without the use of}} poisons, can effectively reduce nest predation and substantially improve waterfowl recruitment...|$|R
