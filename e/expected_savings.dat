40|$|In this paper, a {{mathematical}} model is formulated to quantify the social im- pact an individual has on his/her community when he/she performs any energy e ciency project and transmits that information to his/her neighbours. This model is called the <b>expected</b> power <b>savings</b> model; it combines direct and indi- rect <b>expected</b> power <b>savings</b> of the energy e ciency project for each individual within the network. The indirect savings are quanti ed through the social in- teractions people in the network. The example used in this paper illustrates the e ectiveness of the model by identifying the households who should have free solar water heaters installed in their residential houses based on their in uence through interactions in their community.

The access scheme combines {{the idea of}} a nested cellular scheme and variable guard times. The nested cellular scheme solves the hidden station and the near-far problem whereas the variable guard time ensures that the efficiency of this particular access scheme is higher compared to an access scheme with a fixed guard time. The algorithm for calculating the variable guard time is presented and a lower bound for the <b>expected</b> <b>saving</b> of guard time is given.

A Developer Controlled Insurance Program (DCIP) is also similar to an OCIP but might not include WC; instead, a DCIP provides CGL, umbrella and excess mainly for protection against construction defect claims.|$|E
50|$|Table 1 {{provides}} suggested IPMVP {{options for}} different project characteristics. For each project, an M&V approach which balances the uncertainty in achieved savings {{and the cost}} of the M&V plan should be selected. Some plans include only short term verification approaches and others include repeated measurements for an extended period. Because the expense of determining the amount of savings achieved erodes the benefit of the savings themselves, IPMVP suggests not spending more than 10% of the <b>expected</b> <b>savings</b> on M&V. Often M&V approaches are bundled with other monitoring, support, or maintenance services that help achieve or ensure the savings performance. These costs should not be considered M&V expenses and depending on the project and services details, may greatly exceed 10% of the savings.|$|E

50|$|Reductions {{in public}} {{expenditure}} in Northern Ireland {{have often been}} described as not as harsh as those for the UK as a whole. This is primarily {{due to the fact}} that the UK government has not been able to exert direct control over welfare expenditure in Northern Ireland, because welfare policy is a devolved matter for the Northern Ireland Assembly. On a number of occasions the Assembly has not agreed to cuts in public spending, effectively refusing to make them, despite pressure from the UK government. However, the UK government has sought to recoup the <b>expected</b> <b>savings</b> through a fine on Northern Ireland's block grant, which is calculated according to the Barnett formula, and which fell by 8% in real terms between 2010 and 2015. Research by Oxfam Ireland which was published in 2014 indicated said that austerity measures were affecting Northern Ireland disproportionately due to its being one of the UK's most disadvantaged regions with a high dependence on public spending. In 2017 the Conservative-DUP agreement resulted in an additional £1 billion of public sector funding for Northern Ireland over two years, with the money focused on the health, infrastructure and education budgets.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Name-Your-Own-Price" [...] (NYOP) is {{a system}} under which buyers make a {{suggestion}} for a product’s price (unlike the traditional way where sellers quote a certain price) and the transaction occurs only if a seller accepts this quoted price. What happens is that the seller waits for a potential buyer's offer and can then either accept or reject that 'named price' that the user had offered.As the Internet is continuously being developed and the online marketplaces are becoming increasingly more popular, consumers have more choices in terms of product pricing. Popularised by the reverse auction pioneer, Priceline.com, such pricing strategy asks consumers to 'name their own price' for various products and services like air tickets, hotels, rental cars, ... etc.The first bid a consumer places and the subsequent bid increments express the consumer's willingness or unwillingness to haggle.

40|$|We {{consider}} a municipality {{faced with the}} question of how big to make their new wastewater treatment facility to meet the demand of 10 % expected {{growth in the number of}} new connections. Previously, we developed a real options framework for determining optimal plant size and showed that the model takes on the form of an Asian option. Furthermore, it was shown that if the connection rate growths are closely correlated with the market growth, then the penalty costs associated with having insufficient capacity to treat the wastewater can be effectively hedged, significantly reducing overall expected costs. In this study, we introduce an approximate analytical solution and optimize the plant size of a staged / modular expansion. Based on the given construction cost estimates, we show that a staged expansion has a minimal (<b>expected)</b> <b>savings</b> when connection growth rates are closely correlated to the market growth rates. However, as the correlation decreases to zero, or, alternatively, no attempt is made to hedge the penalty costs, a staged expansion has an <b>expected</b> <b>savings</b> of 20 %...|$|E
40|$|People {{systematically}} underestimate exponential growth. This article {{illustrates this}} phenomenon, its implications, and some potential inter-ventions {{in the context}} of saving for retirement, where savings grow exponentially over long periods of time. Experiment 1 shows that a majority of participants <b>expect</b> <b>savings</b> over 40 years to grow linearly rather than exponentially, leading them to grossly underestimate their account balance at retirement. Experiment 2 demonstrates that this mis-understanding leads to underestimates of the cost of waiting to save, which makes putting off saving more attractive than it should be. Finally, Experiments 3 – 5 show that highlighting the exponential growth of sav-ings motivates both college students and employees to save more for retirement. Making clear to employees the exponential growth of savings before they make crucial decisions about how much to save may be a simple and effective means of increasing retirement savings...|$|R
40|$|A {{state-space}} algorithm for computing {{the solution}} of the 2 -block superoptimal distance problem (SODP) is presented. Given a rational and antistable matrix function R(s) = [R 11 (s) R 12 (s) ], find all stable approximations Q(s) that lexicographically minimize the singular values of the error function E(s) = [R 11 (s) R 12 (s) +Q(s) ]. Conditions are given for which the superoptimal approximation is unique. In addition, an a priori upper bound on the MacMillan degree of the approximation is given. The algorithm may be stopped after minimizing a given number of singular values. This premature termination of the algorithm carries with it an <b>expected</b> <b>saving</b> in the computational effort and a predictable reduction in the MacMillan degree of the approximation.

40|$|The {{performance}} of residential geothermal heat pumps (GHPs) {{was assessed by}} comparing heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system and whole house energy use of GHP houses and control houses. Actual energy savings were calculated and compared to <b>expected</b> <b>savings</b> (based on ARI ratings and literature) and predicted savings (based on coefficient of performance - COP - measurements). Differences between GHP and control houses were normalized for heating degree days and floor area or total insulation value. Predicted savings were consistently slightly below <b>expected</b> <b>savings</b> but {{within the range of}} performance cited by the industry. Average rated COP was 3. 4. Average measured COP was 3. 1. Actual savings were inconsistent and sometimes significantly below predicted savings. No correlation was found between actual savings and actual energy use. This suggests that factors such as insulation and occupant behavior probably have greater impact on energy use than type of HVAC equipment. There was also no clear correlation between climate and actual savings or between climate and actual energy use. There was a trend between GHP installation date and savings. Newer units appear to have lower savings than some of the older units which is opposite of what one would expect given the increase in rated efficiencies of GHPs. There are a number of explanations for why actual savings are repeatedly below rated savings or predicted savings. Poor ground loop sizing or installation procedures could be an issue. Given that performance is good compared to ASHPs but poor compared to electric resistance homes, the shortfall in savings could be due to duct leakage. The takeback effect could also be a reason for lower than <b>expected</b> <b>savings.</b> Occupants of heat pump homes are likely to heat more rooms and to use more air-conditioning than occupants of electric resistance homes. 10 refs., 17 figs., 10 tabs...|$|E
