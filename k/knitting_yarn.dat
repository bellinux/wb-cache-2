25|$|The next {{process is}} to draw the slivers out further, and to give the fibres a small twist to {{strengthen}} the resulting slubbing such {{that it can be}} wound onto a bobbin. At Coldharbour Mill, this is demonstrated on a Price Smith and Stells draw box of 1959. The bobbins from this machine are then placed in a further draw box by Prince Smith and Stells, this time an 1898 machine, and the thread from a pair of bobbins is drawn out to a seventh of its diameter, and given a light twist. If this output is to be used for Aran yarn production, it is termed a roving, and is sent on to the spinning frame. However, if the slubbing is for double <b>knitting</b> <b>yarn,</b> the slubbing must go through another reduction on a draw box.|$|E

2500|$|Between 1919 and 1931 Spring Hall was a {{guest house}} for young men, owned by J.H. Whitley. It was put up for sale in 1928–1929, then between 1931 and 1938 the {{building}} was empty. It was purchased in 1938 by the Halifax <b>knitting</b> <b>yarn</b> firm of Patons and Baldwins. Between 1929 and 1940 the sports recreation ground was used for matches by Halifax Rovers Amateur Football Club. The Hall was requisitioned again in World War II. In 1948 Patons and Baldwins moved to Darlington, and Spring Hall was presented to Halifax Corporation. The Corporation used the land as a sports ground for schools, and in 1959 built the Percival N Whitley Memorial Sports Hall there. [...] In 1973 two applications were made by B.A. Waddington, the borough architect, to build a sports pavilion in the grounds. Between 1942 and 1973, cricket matches between Halifax councillors and officials were played in the grounds. In 1977 and 1978, plans were submitted by the Council for a new leisure centre in the grounds. Between 1947 and 1992, the Halifax branch of the National Council of Women Great Britain used the hall for meetings.|$|E

40|$|Knittability can {{be defined}} as the ability of yarns to run on {{knitting}} machines without problems. Knittability can be achieved when less stress is applied on the knitting machine parts by the <b>knitting</b> <b>yarns.</b> This paper presents a novel measuring system for the knitting force needed to perform <b>knitting</b> <b>yarns</b> on flat <b>knitting</b> machine based on data acquisition system (DAS). The proposed system is used to measure the knitting force at different machine settings and different properties of the <b>knitting</b> <b>yarns</b> to determine the optimal production conditions. For this reason, three types of knitted fabric structures (single jersey, Rib 1 × 1, and full cardigan) with three different loop lengths and five different twists of ply yarn were produced. The obtained results showed the optimal yarn ply twist factor (αe) which gave minimum knitting force (less stress on needles or <b>knitting</b> <b>yarns)</b> at different loop lengths for each structure...|$|R
2500|$|In Britain in the 1950s {{when the}} baby boom years {{following}} World War II caused an increased requirement for hand-knitting, I.X. Products produced a brightly coloured and marketable plastic row counter with patent number 424432. This was a barrel-shaped counter which sat in stable fashion on the knitting needle by {{the aid of a}} central metal spring. The assemblage consisted of a double rotating inner barrel and an outer fixed and slotted skin which was pinned to the central spring. [...] The two separately rotating halves of the inner barrel were printed with numbers, and the outer slotted skin rotated over the barrels, revealing a single ten and a single unit at one time. Precise engineering ensured that there was just enough ease of movement for the turning of the barrels, but just enough friction to prevent movement of the barrels while vigorous knitting continued. However the introduction in the late 1950s of double <b>knitting</b> <b>yarn</b> and the consequent popular use of thicker needles tended to damage the springs which were intended for needles of a maximum thickness of 3.25mm. [...] This design and most of the barrel-shaped on-needle counters which followed it had a white or cream central barrel and a decoratively coloured outer skin.|$|E

50|$|The {{simplest}} binding off {{method is}} to pass each knitted loop over the loop next to it.

Both, Thermal comfort properties such as thermal absorptiveness, thermal conductivity, air permeability and utility properties like percent stretch, spirality, bursting strength of core <b>yarn</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics and hollow <b>yarn</b> <b>knitted</b> fabrics were assessed. A new method was proposed and discussed for producing hollow yarns at fabric stage (in this case knitted fabric) which involved the following steps: - a) Production of ring spun yarns, comprising nylon as a core and cotton as a sheath, using Ring Spinning System. b) Production of knitted fabrics of different knit structures viz., single jersey, rib and interlock using above mentioned yarn. c) Dissolution of core element i. e.
