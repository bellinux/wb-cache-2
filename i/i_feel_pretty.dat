Mert from the La Choy commercials and Fred from the Kern's Bakery commercials appear as Amanda's friends where they were performed by Jim Henson and Jerry Juhl (who also voices the narrator) while Frank Oz does the puppeteering.|$|E

In an interview with Stereogum, Gibbard said of the new album, [...] "I do think {{from start to finish}} it's a much better record than Codes And Keys.

500|$|Champion {{held out}} for several hours, {{wounding}} three of the vigilantes, and {{was said to have}} killed four others. Another settler by the name of Jack Flagg passed by Champion's ranch on his wagon together with his stepson and witnessed the siege. The Invaders recognized Jack Flagg as one of the men on the list and they started shooting at him. Flagg then rode away and as the Invaders gave chase, he grabbed his rifle and beat them back. During the siege, Champion kept a poignant journal which contained a number of notes he wrote to friends while taking cover inside the cabin. [...] "Boys, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>pretty</b> lonesome just now. I wish there was someone here with me so we could watch all sides at once," [...] he wrote. The last journal entry read: [...] "Well, they have just got through shelling the house like hail. I heard them splitting wood. I guess they are going to fire the house tonight. I think I will make a break when night comes, if alive. Shooting again. It's not night yet. The house is all fired. Goodbye, boys, if I never see you again." ...|$|E

500|$|... Ratajkowski has {{a variety}} of {{upcoming}} roles. She will play Jessica Weintraub, the female lead opposite Spencer Boldman in the film Cruise, which is written and directed by Robert Siegel. Ratajkowski was hired as part of the cast of the film In Darkness, alongside Natalie Dormer, Ed Skrein, and Stacy Martin. She has a role opposite Aaron Paul in Welcome Home. On June 20, 2017 she announced a role alongside Amy Schumer's in <b>I</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>Pretty.</b> On September 23, Ratajkowski walked the Milan Fashion Week runway for Bottega Veneta. Later that month, she revealed that she was working with a dialogue coach to learn the French and Italian languages for Lying and Stealing. On November 1, Tyga posted an unofficial 60-second video teaser for [...] "Tequilla Kisses", which featured Ratajkowski. As a result, Ratajkowski was noted as the starring performer in Tyga's [...] "Tequilla Kisses" [...] bonus track music video. However, on November 4, Tyga removed the full video from various points of internet access including his own Instagram account, following complaints from Ratajkowski that the video was from a lookbook Ratajkowski did with Phillip Lopez in 2013. On November 9, Harper's Bazaar UK published a story about Ratajkowski's impending release of her own swimwear brand after Emrata Holdings LLC acquired the trademark to Inamorata in August and she left a trail of breadcrumbs on social media. Ratajkowski retweeted the story.|$|E
500|$|In 1936, Feller {{was signed}} by Cy Slapnicka, a scout for the Indians, for one dollar and an autographed baseball. While {{scouting}} Feller, Slapnicka said, [...] "This was a kid pitcher I had to get. I knew he was something special. His fastball was fast and fuzzy; it didn't go in a straight line; it would wiggle and shoot around. I didn't know then that he was smart and had {{the heart of a}} lion, but I knew that I was looking at an arm the likes of which you see only once in a lifetime." [...] Feller was assigned to the Fargo-Moorhead Twins and was to report there after finishing the high school semester. Slapnicka was later named general manager of the Indians and transferred Feller's contract from Fargo-Moorhead to the New Orleans Pelicans. He was planning to add Feller, along with outfielder Tommy Henrich, to the major league roster after a few exhibition and semi-pro games without visiting either farm club. By doing so, the Indians would be in violation of Major League Baseball's rule stating that, at the time, only minor league teams could sign amateur baseball players to contracts. After a three-month investigation, concluding in December 1936, about whether the Indians broke any Major League Baseball rules by signing Feller, Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis disagreed with the argument presented by Slapnicka and Indians president Alva Bradley, but awarded both Feller and Henrich free agency and required the club to pay a $7,500 fine. Landis made the decision partly due to the testimony of Feller and his father, who wanted his son to play for Cleveland and who had also told Landis he would take the issue to court. Feller elected to remain with the Indians but Henrich joined the New York Yankees. Sports columnist Joe Williams wrote, [...] "For $7500 the Cleveland Indians received $500,000 worth of publicity. ... <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>pretty</b> sure Mr. Alva Bradley, president of the Indians, will admit this is the cheapest investment he ever made in publicity." ...|$|E

2500|$|In June 1988, police closed an {{investigation}} into alleged jamming of the Cox campaign's phone lines by supporters of Rosenberg. [...] "For several weeks, about every third call we got {{was one of these}} bogus calls. You would hear a kind of whirring noise like a machine of some kind. ... It got so bad just before the election that we had to move our get-out-the vote operation to another office and use cellular phones in the field," [...] said Cox's campaign manager Bob Schuman. A representative of the police said that charges were not made because though the location of the jamming was traced, it could not be determined specifically which individuals were responsible. [...] "It's incredible to me that someone can do what was done to us and we have an absolute identification" [...] of the location of the jamming, said Schuman. [...] "I can't speak for Chris, but <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>pretty</b> strongly that we don't want to let them get away with it. We don't want to let it end here," [...] he said. Rosenberg denied knowledge about the phone jamming. [...] "I don't know anything about it. I don't want to speculate about who might have done this to Cox's phones, but I certainly don't condone it," [...] said Rosenberg. Rosenberg posited that the Cox campaign was requested police look into the matter as a tactic to discourage him from attempting a write-in-campaign against Cox in the November general election for Congress. According to the Orange County Deputy District Attorney, the phone calls were traced to a residence owned by Rosenberg supporters. The residence belonged to a developer and his wife who had each made donations of $1,000 to Rosenberg's campaign for Congress.|$|E

They are accustomed to victory, and are confident in their own valour and discipline. Our officers are as raw as our men, and we must expect that all sorts of blunders will be made at first. I can tell you that I am very well satisfied that our first battle is going to be fought with the odds greatly on our side.
