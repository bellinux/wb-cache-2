5|$|Angel {{gives up}} {{his share of}} the gold to Pike in return for sending one crate of rifles and {{ammunition}} to a band of rebels opposed to Mapache. The <b>holdup</b> goes largely as planned until Deke's posse turns up on the train the gang has robbed. The posse chases them to the Mexican border, only to be foiled again as the robbers blow up a trestle spanning the Rio Grande, dumping the entire posse into the river. The pursuers temporarily regroup at a riverside camp and then quickly take off again after the Bunch.|$|E
5|$|Frank Stilwell {{had just}} arrived in Bisbee with his livery stable partner, Pete Spence, when the two were arrested by Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp for the <b>holdup.</b> Both were friends of Ike Clanton and the McLaurys. At the {{preliminary}} hearing, Stilwell and Spence were able to provide several witnesses who supported their alibis. Judge Spicer dropped the charges for insufficient evidence {{just as he had}} done for Doc Holliday earlier in the year.|$|E

5|$|Wyatt and Virgil Earp {{rode with}} a sheriff's posse and tracked the Bisbee stage robbers. Virgil had been {{appointed}} Tombstone's town marshal (i.e., chief of police) on June 6, 1881, after Ben Sippy abandoned the job. However, Virgil {{at the same time}} continued to hold his position of deputy U.S. marshal, and it was in this federal capacity that he continued to chase robbers of stage coaches outside Tombstone city limits. At the scene of the <b>holdup,</b> Wyatt discovered an unusual boot print left by someone wearing a custom-repaired boot heel. The Earps checked a shoe repair shop in Bisbee known to provide widened boot heels and were able to link the boot print to Stilwell.|$|E
5|$|The single-player mode lets players control three characters: Michael De Santa, Trevor Philips and Franklin Clinton—criminals whose stories {{interconnect}} as they complete missions. Some {{missions are}} completed {{with only one}} character and others feature two or three. Outside the missions, players may switch between characters at will {{by means of a}} directional compass on the HUD. The game may switch characters automatically during missions to complete certain objectives. A character's compass avatar will flash red if he is in danger and needs help, and flash white if he has a strategic advantage. Though players complete missions as any of the three protagonists, the more difficult heist missions require aid from AI-controlled accomplices with unique skill sets like computer hacking and driving. If an accomplice survives a successful heist, they take a cut from the cash reward and may be available for later missions with improvements to their unique skills. There are multiple options for completing heists; in a <b>holdup</b> mission, players may either stealthily subdue civilians with an incapacitating agent or conspicuously storm the venue with guns drawn.|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the hydrodynamics results of two-phase downflow and upflow through fixed beds with porous particles shows that the flow regimes, two-phase pressure drop and liquid <b>holdups</b> are strongly influenced {{by the presence of}} the non-Newtonian liquids. With highly viscous non-Newtonian liquids the hydrodynamic characteristics (pressure drop, dynamic and total liquid <b>holdups)</b> of two-phase downflow are close to those of two-phase upflow-the axial dispersion appears to be an important cause for the possible effects of the hydrodynamics on the reactor performance.

25|$|In late 1919, the Bolsheviks began {{gaining the}} upper hand in the Russian Civil War. Alexander Kolchak's White Movement and its allies faced an upsurge of {{partisan}} activity, as the Bolsheviks initiated a large scale offensive on the Eastern Front. A coalition of Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and Left SRs formed a united political center in order to coordinate their actions against the Whites. The Red partisans took over Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk on 24 December 1919 and 5 January 1920 respectively. On 4 January, Kolchak resigned, relegating the leadership of the White Movement to Anton Denikin and Grigory Semyonov. On 6 April, the united leftist opposition formed the Far Eastern Republic as a semi autonomous buffer state between the Bolshevik dominated Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic {{and the rest of the}} Russian Far East still controlled by the White Movement and Japanese interventionists. On paper the Far Eastern Republic incorporated the Kamchatka Oblast, Zabaykalsky Krai, Primorsky Krai, Sakhalin Oblast, Amur Oblast and the Chinese Eastern Railway. However the eastern portion of Zabaykalsky Krai was still under the control of forces loyal to ataman Semyonov, forming the so called Chita <b>Holdup.</b> The <b>holdup</b> thus prevented the Reds from connecting the Far East Republic with the Primorsky Krai.|$|E
25|$|During {{the night}} of 7/8 December the 2/19th began the attack on Jerusalem by taking the Deir Yesin position. After a <b>holdup</b> in daylight, the {{battalion}} renewed the attack in the afternoon. The following morning, the Turks had retreated. Sergeants Hurcomb and Sedgewick went out to reconnoitre and met the Mayor of Jerusalem and a party of civilians who offered them the keys of the abandoned city. After the capture of Jerusalem, the 2/19th, reduced to some 300 men, went into billets in the city. On 11 December it provided a guard of honour for General Allenby's ceremonial entry into the city.|$|E
25|$|In modern {{industrial}} uses, a {{packing material}} {{is used in}} the column instead of trays when low pressure drops across the column are required. Other factors that favor packing are: vacuum systems, smaller diameter columns, corrosive systems, systems prone to foaming, systems requiring low liquid <b>holdup,</b> and batch distillation. Conversely, factors that favor plate columns are: presence of solids in feed, high liquid rates, large column diameters, complex columns, columns with wide feed composition variation, columns with a chemical reaction, absorption columns, columns limited by foundation weight tolerance, low liquid rate, large turn-down ratio and those processes subject to process surges.|$|E

25|$|On April 16—one {{day after}} the Braintree robbery-murders—the Federal Immigration Service (FIS) called Chief Stewart to discuss Galleanist and anarchist Coacci, whom Stewart had arrested on their behalf two years earlier. Coacci was slated for {{deportation}} on April 15, 1920, {{the day of the}} Braintree <b>holdup,</b> but telephoned with the excuse that his wife was ill. The FIS asked Stewart to investigate Coacci's excuse for failing to report for deportation on April 15. On April 16, officers discovered Coacci at home and determined that he had given a false alibi for not showing up for deportation. They offered him another week, but Coacci declined and left for Italy on April 18, 1920.|$|E
25|$|Continuous {{distillation}} {{differs from}} batch distillation in the respect that concentrations should not change over time. Continuous distillation can be run {{at a steady}} state for an arbitrary amount of time. For any source material of specific composition, the main variables that affect the purity of products in continuous distillation are the reflux ratio {{and the number of}} theoretical equilibrium stages, in practice determined by the number of trays or the height of packing. Reflux is a flow from the condenser back to the column, which generates a recycle that allows a better separation with a given number of trays. Equilibrium stages are ideal steps where compositions achieve vapor–liquid equilibrium, repeating the separation process and allowing better separation given a reflux ratio. A column with a high reflux ratio may have fewer stages, but it refluxes a large amount of liquid, giving a wide column with a large <b>holdup.</b> Conversely, a column with a low reflux ratio must have a large number of stages, thus requiring a taller column.|$|E
25|$|On 1 October, the FER {{launched}} its third Chita operation. The first column comprising of the 2nd Amur Division, 2nd Cavalry Brigade, partisan units, an armored train and a tank platoon under V. A. Popov assaulted Zubarevo and Razmachino. The 1st Infantry Brigade of I. E. Fadeev targeted the Ust Haramibir and Dzhidinskii {{villages in the}} center. On the left flank the Zabaikalsk Cavalry Division of N. Korotaev struck the Borzia, Haranor, Olovianaia railway stations. The rest of the FER army remained in the reserve. On 15 October, the last Japanese units withdrew from Transbaikal setting the FER Amur Front in motion four days later. On 20 October, the Reds occupied Karymskaya isolating the Chita garrison from the Manchuria railway system. On 22 October, the 8th FER Cavalry Regiment executed a rapid maneuver towards the Verchnechitinsky village. Having defeated its defenders it entered Chita. The left flank of the Whites situated between Adrianovka and Dauria fled to Manchuria. The Chita <b>holdup</b> had been terminated, 4 White divisions stationed at Olovianaia held their ground until 29 October.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Two {{approaches}} to reduce computational requirements for solving reactive distillation {{problems have been}} studied: simplification of the model using physical assumptions and numerical approximation using an orthogonal collocation technique. The results of a full-order model with time dependent stage molar <b>holdups</b> was compared to published steady-state experimental data and {{was found to be}} more accurate than previously published methods. Two example problems concerning reactive distillation columns with different number of stages were investigated in order to find limitations of the order-reduction technique. The steady-state results obtained in both cases were remarkably accurate, even though the reduced-order model contained only 40 percent of the number of equations. However, step and pulse responses indicated that very low order models did not provide good approximations in the dynamic behavior of a column which contained 29 stages. Modeling errors introduced by either physical or numerical approximations were compared for several example problems. The results showed that the reduced-order models with time-dependent <b>holdups</b> provided better steady-state and dynamic results than models using the physical approximation of constant molar <b>holdups</b> in almost every case. The only case in which the reduced-order model failed was when the 40...|$|R

500|$|The prosecution's case rested {{largely on}} the {{testimony}} of two men who had pleaded guilty to participating in the <b>holdup.</b> The prosecution called four witnesses: Avon White and John Rivers (both of whom had already been convicted of the robbery) and the manager and teller of the bank. White and Rivers, although convicted, {{had not yet been}} sentenced for the robbery and were promised that the charges would be dropped in exchange for their testimony. White and Rivers testified that Shakur had guarded one of the doors with a [...]357 magnum pistol and that Sadiki had served as a lookout and drove the getaway truck during the robbery; neither White nor Rivers was cross-examined due to the defense attorney's refusal to participate in the trial. Shakur's aunt and lawyer, Evelyn Williams, was also cited for contempt after walking out of the courtroom after many of her attempted motions were denied. The trial was delayed for a few days after Shakur was diagnosed with pleurisy.|$|E
40|$|Nonlinear low-order {{models are}} {{developed}} for two coupled distillation columns separating a ternary mixture of methanol, ethanol and 1 -propanol.
