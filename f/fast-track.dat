The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Home Affairs met on 27 December to discuss the issue, and Union Home Secretary R. K. Singh and Delhi Police Commissioner Neeraj Kumar were summoned to appear. The Delhi High Court approved the creation of five <b>fast-track</b> courts to try rape and sexual assault cases.

40|$|AbstractFast-Tracking to accelerate, overlap or {{compress}} schedules has {{an impact}} on project predictability in terms of achieving the planned objectives (time, cost, and quality). Predictability {{plays an important role in}} project success. Some studies focused on the <b>fast-tracking</b> impact on each objective; however, no research directly addressed the relationship between <b>fast-tracking</b> and predictability of the project's objectives. This paper investigates the relationship between <b>fast-tracking</b> and predictability with regard to success in meeting the project's planned objectives. A literature review was used. Significant findings in the study are the confirmations of the literature about the impact of <b>fast-tracking</b> on project predictability. This impact is that <b>fast-tracking</b> may lead to less predictability for the project's outcomes. The research results emphasize the need for further investigation of the relationship between <b>fast-tracking</b> technique and the project's predictability indices (cost variance, time variance and quality variance) in order to a achieve better understanding of the relationship and improve predictability...|$|R

It also is checking the possibility of setting up <b>fast-track</b> courts to dispose of pending cases pertaining to crimes against women. The Government of Tamil Nadu also announced a 13-point action plan to ensure safety of women in Tamil Nadu and said that incidents of sexual assault would be treated as a grave crime, and probes would be entrusted to top police officials. The chief minister also said that daily hearings would be conducted in all sexual abuse cases in the state for speedy trials at specially constituted <b>fast-track</b> courts, and women prosecutors would be appointed as government counsels. The Jammu and Kashmir government also announced plans to change the state's laws against sexual offences and gender crimes. The Government of Himachal Pradesh decided to set up state and district-level committees to review progress of all cases of crimes against women.|$|E

5|$|He {{was arrested}} on 10 October 1990 on charges {{relating}} to kidnapping and extortion. The charges alleged an extortion scheme that involved tying a supposed bomb to a British businessman's leg. The Bhutto family considered the indictment politically motivated and fabricated. In the October 1990 elections, {{he was elected to}} the National Assembly while in jail. Bhutto and the PPP staged a walkout from the inaugural session of the National Assembly to protest Zardari's incarceration. He posted $20,000 bail, but his release was blocked by a government ordinance that removed a court's power to release suspects being tried in the terrorist court, which <b>fast-track</b> trials for alleged terrorists. The ordinance was later revoked and a special court acquitted him of bank fraud and conspiracy to murder political opponents. He was freed in February 1993. In March 1994, Zardari was acquitted of bank fraud charges. All other corruption charges relating to Bhutto's first term were dropped or thrown out of the courts.|$|E

40|$|<b>Fast-tracking</b> {{a project}} {{involves}} carrying out sequential activities in parallel, partially overriding their original order of precedence, {{to reduce the}} overall project duration. The current predominant mathematical models of <b>fast-tracking</b> {{are based on the}} concepts of activity sensitivity, evolution, dependency and, sometimes, information exchange uncertainty, and aim to determine optimum activity overlaps. However, these models require some subjective inputs from the scheduler and most of them neglect the merge event bias. In this paper, a stochastic model for schedule <b>fast-tracking</b> is proposed. Relevant findings highlight the existence of a pseudo-physical barrier that suggests that the possibility of shortening a schedule by {{more than a quarter of}} its original duration is highly unlikely. The explicit non-linear relationship between cost and overlap has also been quantified for the first time. Finally, manual calculations using the new model are compared with results from a Genetic Algorithm through a case study...|$|R

40|$|Uncertainties make {{construction}} {{dynamic and}} unstable, mostly by creating non value-adding changeiterations among construction processes.

For this reason,to effectively handle <b>fast-tracking</b> change iterations involved in <b>fast-tracking</b> need to be identified, andthe dynamic behavior of construction resulting from those change iterations {{must be dealt with}} in asystematic manner. As an effort to address some of these challenging issues in fast-trackingconstruction, this research paper identifies different change iteration cycles involved in fast-trackingconstruction and observes the characteristics and behavior patterns of change. All of research findingsare incorporated into a cohesive system dynamics model and the model simulation confirms thatmanagerial decisions on change or rework should be made based on the proper assessment of theirtradeoff. In addition, a case study of highway and bridge construction projects shows the potential ofhow <b>fast-tracking</b> construction can benefit from dynamic change management in real world settings...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of {{natural language processing}} (NLP) components is resource-intensive and therefore justifies exploring ways of reducing development time and effort when building NLP components. This paper addresses the experimental <b>fast-tracking</b> of the {{development of}} finite-state morphological analysers for Xhosa, Swati and (Southern) Ndebele by using an existing prototype of a morphological analyser for Zulu. The research question is whether <b>fast-tracking</b> is feasible across the language boundaries between these closely related varieties. The objective is a thorough assessment of the recognition rates yielded by the Zulu morphological analyser for the three related languages. The strategy is to use <b>fast-tracking</b> techniques that consist of several cycles of the following steps: applying the analyser to corpus data from all languages, identifying (types of) failures, and implementing the respective changes in the analyser. The tests show that the high degree of shared typological properties and formal similarities among the Nguni varieties warrants a modular <b>fast-tracking</b> approach. Those word forms in these languages that were recognized by the Zulu analyser were mostly adequately interpreted. Therefore, the focus lies on providing the necessary adaptations based on an analysis of the failure output for each language. As a result, the development of analysers for Xhosa, Swati and Ndebele is considerably faster than the creation of the Zulu prototype. The paper concludes with comments on the feasibility of the experiment, and the results of the evaluation. 1...|$|R
