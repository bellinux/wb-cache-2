Because {{of the importance of}} solar energy as a renewable energy source, an accurate determination of significant covariates and their relationships with the amount of <b>global</b> solar <b>radiation</b> reaching the Earth is a critical research problem. There are numerous meteorological and terrestrial covariates {{that can be used in}} the analysis of horizontal <b>global</b> solar <b>radiation.</b> Some of these covariates are highly correlated with each other. It is possible to find a large variety of linear or non-linear models to explain the amount of horizontal <b>global</b> solar <b>radiation.</b> However, models that explain the amount of <b>global</b> solar <b>radiation</b> with the smallest set of covariates should be obtained.

It is important when comparing resin UV performanceto ensure that the testing {{has been done on}} a consistent basis. In Figure 1, accelerated weathering data is presented. Generally, 2,000 hours corresponds to 1 year in Florida and 1,400 hours to 1 year in Southern Canada. Often terms like “UV-8” are used. UV-8 means the material can withstand 8,000 hours in a Xenon Ci-65 weatherometer. UV-2 or UV-4 would mean 2,000 or 4,000 hours respectively. Hence, UV-8 corresponds to approximately 4 years of continuous outdoor exposure in Florida. It is important to understand which weatherometer, i.e. Carbon Arc or Xenon, was used, as well as the details of how the weatherometer was run. ASTM D-2565 is the recognized standard. Testing can be performed using actual outdoor weathering exposure, such as Florida and Arizona, to confirm this data. Note Figure 1 uses the industry standard criteria of when the sample has reached less than 50% of its original break elongation to determine the end of the test. In most cases useful life of the part extends beyond this point. All samples in Figure 1 are nonpigmented as supplied by Exxon Chemical. The UV performance test data can be found on our data sheets for each specific grade.Light Stability CharacteristicsUltraviolet (UV) Stabilization Plastics are attacked and deteriorate when exposed to direct sunlight. When plastic tanks absorb the sun’s ultraviolet light, the UV energy excites the polymers’chains, causing them to break. The effects are discoloration, embrittlement and eventual cracking. Elevated temperatures and oxygen tend to accelerate the deterioration. Tanks listed as suitable for outdoor service are protected from UV attack by: coloring or pigmenting and/or adding internal stabilizers which preferentially absorb or dissipate the UV energy. Shading tanks from the sun will also prevent deterioration. Tanks must be free to expand or contract, avoid excessive tension on the tank. For assistance in selecting the appropriate tank for a specific application, see the Tank Resin Selector Guides with reputable resin manufacturers.Resources being published by [...] siting additional references to AVENGENERAL ISOLINES OF <b>GLOBAL</b> <b>RADIATION</b> AND THERE EFFECTS ON POLYMERSYears = 70 x UV Rating (Your Location’s Isoline) (from Figure 3)Example: Natural Part, Molded Properly, Using UV-8 Additive Package For Use in Floridai.e.Florida= 140 Kcal/cm@2/yr.

This study aims to parameterise the Bristow-Campbell model for the daily <b>global</b> solar <b>radiation</b> estimation in the Tibetan Plateau and propose a method to rasterise the daily <b>global</b> solar <b>radiation.</b> Observed daily solar radiation and diurnal temperature data from eleven stations over the Tibetan Plateau during 1971 - 2010 were used to calibrate and validate the Bristow-Campbell radiation model. The extra-terrestrial radiation and clear sky atmospheric transmittance were calculated on a Geographic Information System (GIS) platform. Results show that the Bristow-Campbell model performs well after adjusting the parameters, the average Pearson's correlation coefficients (r), Nash-Sutcliffe equation (NSE), ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data (RSR), and root mean-square error (RMSE) of 11 stations are 0. 85, 2. 81 MJ m(- 2) day(- 1), 0. 3 and 0. 77 respectively. Gridded maximum and minimum average temperature data were obtained using Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) and validated by the Chinese Ecosystem Research Network (CERN) stations' data. The spatial daily <b>global</b> solar <b>radiation</b> distribution pattern was estimated and analysed by combining the solar radiation model (Bristow-Campbell model) and meteorological interpolation model (PRISM). Based on the overall results, it can be concluded that a calibrated Bristow-Campbell performs well for the Tibetan Plateau and can provide reasonably accurate <b>global</b> solar <b>radiation</b> estimates. The Bristow-Campbell radiation model coupled with the PRISM is effective in rasterising <b>global</b> solar <b>radiation.</b> (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
