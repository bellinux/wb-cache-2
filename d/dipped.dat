50|$|Another way of {{representing}} strike and <b>dip</b> is by <b>dip</b> and <b>dip</b> direction. The <b>dip</b> direction is the azimuth {{of the direction}} the <b>dip</b> as projected to the horizontal (like the trend of a linear feature in trend and plunge measurements), which is 90° off the strike angle. For example, a bed <b>dipping</b> 30° to the South, would have an East-West strike (and would be written 090°/30° S using strike and <b>dip),</b> but would be written as 30/180 using the <b>dip</b> and <b>dip</b> direction method.|$|R

40|$|Defective interfering {{particles}} (<b>DIPs)</b> are virus-like {{particles that}} arise during virus growth, fail {{to grow in}} the absence of virus, and replicate at the expense of virus during co-infections. The inhibitory effects of <b>DIPs</b> on virus growth are well established, but little is known about how <b>DIPs</b> influence their own growth. Here vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and its <b>DIPs</b> were used to co-infect BHK cells, and the effect of <b>DIP</b> dose on virus and <b>DIP</b> production was measured using a yield-reduction assay. The resulting dose–response data were used to fit and evaluate mathematical models that employed different assumptions. Our analysis supports a multiple-hit process where <b>DIPs</b> inhibit or promote virus and <b>DIP</b> production, depending on dose. Specifically, three regimes of co-infection were apparent: (i) low <b>DIP</b> – where both virus and <b>DIPs</b> are amplified, (ii) medium <b>DIP</b> – where amplification of both virus and <b>DIPs</b> is inhibited, and (iii) high <b>DIP</b> – with limited recovery of virus production and further inhibition of <b>DIP</b> growth. In addition, serial-passage infections enabled us to estimate the frequency of de novo <b>DIP</b> generation during virus amplification. Our combined experiments and models provide a means to understand better how <b>DIPs</b> quantitatively impact the growth of viruses and the spread of their infections...|$|R

5|$|Attendance {{levels at}} Andover's matches reached a {{peak in the}} late 1960s.

In the years following their promotion to the Southern League, average attendances started to drop until they <b>dipped</b> below the 200 mark during the 1970s. Since then, the average attendance at Andover's matches has remained at approximately 140, although this figure <b>dipped</b> below 100 in the 1999–2000 season following their last relegation from the Southern League.

To investigate <b>Dip</b> 2 a gene expression and function in embryo and adult, a <b>Dip</b> 2 a-LacZ mouse model was generated by insertion of β-Gal cDNA after <b>Dip</b> 2 a promoter using CRISPR/Cas 9 technology. <b>Dip</b> 2 a-LacZ mouse was designed to be a lacZ reporter mouse as well as a <b>Dip</b> 2 a knockout mouse.
