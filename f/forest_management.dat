5|$|In 1902, President Roosevelt first greatly {{expanded}} the reserve and then divided the reserve into four separate units, with Shoshone being the largest. Upon {{the creation of}} the U.S. Forest Service in 1905, the reserve was designated a National Forest, but the current wording and title were formulated forty years later in 1945. A remnant of the earliest years of the <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> is the Wapiti Ranger Station which is located west of Cody, Wyoming. The station was built in 1903 and is the oldest surviving ranger station in any national forest, and is now designated a National Historic Landmark.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, annual {{timber harvest}} revenue on federal forest land {{nationwide}} peaked at $1.5 billion. Following that year, {{the impact of}} overharvesting and increased environmental concerns began to negatively impact timber sales on the O lands. In 1994, the federal Northwest Forest Plan was implemented. Designed to guide <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> of federal lands while protecting old-growth forest habitat for endangered species such as the Northern spotted owl, the plan restricted the land available for timber harvest. By 1998, revenue on federal forest lands fell {{to a third of}} the peak 1989 revenue, with areas in the Northwest particularly hard-hit.|$|E

5|$|Most {{states had}} placed {{restrictions}} on fisher trapping by the 1930s, coincidental {{with the end}} of the logging boom. A combination of forest regrowth in abandoned farmlands and improved <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> practices increased available habitat and allowed remnant populations to recover. Populations have since recovered sufficiently that the species is no longer endangered. Increasing forest cover in eastern North America means that fisher populations will remain sufficiently robust for the near future. Between 1955 and 1985, some states had allowed limited trapping to resume. In areas where fishers were eliminated, porcupine populations subsequently increased. Areas with a high density of porcupines were found to have extensive damage to timber crops. In these cases, fishers were reintroduced by releasing adults relocated from other places into the forest. Once the fisher populations became reestablished, porcupine numbers returned to natural levels. In Washington State, fisher sightings were reported into the 1980s, but an extensive survey in the 1990s did not locate any.|$|E
5|$|The highway turns westward along Wirtz Road {{and past}} the {{southern}} terminus of county road F-97 {{in the northern part}} of Gladwin County. Near a crossing with the Cedar River, M-18 turns north along Bard Road and then west again along Renas Road. The highway returns to its northerly course when it turns to run along Clarwin Road, which runs along the Clare–Gladwin county line. The roadway angles to the northwest briefly, cutting across the extreme northeast corner of Clare County as the highway crosses into Roscommon County. Through the southern portion of the county, the road runs through the Roscommon <b>forest</b> <b>management</b> unit of the Au Sable State Forest as it approaches Prudenville. In that community, M-18 turns northeasterly and runs along M-55 along the eastern shore of Houghton Lake. The two highways separate on the eastern edge of town, and M-18 turns northward, intersecting the northern end of M-157. M-18 continues north, parallel to Interstate 75 (I-75) near Higgins Lake; M-18 crosses I-75 at exit239 south of Roscommon.|$|E

The research finding shows that the participation level of the local government and Pesanggem farmers in the collaborative <b>forest</b> resources <b>management</b> is quite high. The activities of the respondents in the collaborative <b>forest</b> resources <b>management</b> are deciding the planting location, planning, evaluating, monitoring, and preparing the seedbed.

40|$|The {{attributes}} of social ecological systems affect {{the management of}} commons. Strengthening and enhancing social capital and the enforcement of rules and sanctions aid in the collective action of communities in <b>forest</b> fire <b>management.</b> Using a set of variables drawn from previous studies on the management of commons, we conducted a study across 20 community forest user groups in Central Siwalik, Nepal, by dividing the groups into two categories based on the type and level of their <b>forest</b> fire <b>management</b> response. Our study shows that the collective action in <b>forest</b> fire <b>management</b> {{is consistent with the}} collective actions in other community development activities. However, the effectiveness of collective action is primarily dependent on the complex interaction of various variables. We found that strong social capital, strong enforcement of rules and sanctions, and users' participation in crafting the rules were the major variables that strengthen collective action in <b>forest</b> fire <b>management.</b> Conversely, users' dependency on a daily wage and a lack of transparency were the variables that weaken collective action. In fire-prone forests such as the Siwalik, our results indicate that strengthening social capital and forming and enforcing <b>forest</b> fire <b>management</b> rules are important variables that encourage people to engage in collective action in fire management.
