25|$|Later (in 1959) von Braun {{published}} a short booklet, condensed from episodes that had appeared <b>in</b> <b>This</b> <b>Week</b> Magazine before—describing his updated {{concept of the}} first manned lunar landing. The scenario included only a single and relatively small spacecraft—a winged lander with a crew of only two experienced pilots who had already circumnavigated the Moon on an earlier mission. The brute-force direct ascent flight schedule used a rocket design with five sequential stages, loosely based on the Nova designs that were under discussion at this time. After a night launch from a Pacific island, the first three stages would bring the spacecraft (with the two remaining upper stages attached) to terrestrial escape velocity, with each burn creating an acceleration of 8–9 times standard gravity. Residual propellant in the third stage {{would be used for}} the deceleration intended to commence only a few hundred kilometers above the landing site in a crater near the lunar north pole. The fourth stage provided acceleration to lunar escape velocity, while the fifth stage would be responsible for a deceleration during return to the Earth to a residual speed that allows aerocapture of the spacecraft ending in a runway landing, {{much in the way of}} the Space Shuttle. One remarkable feature of this technical tale is that the engineer Wernher von Braun anticipated a medical phenomenon that would become apparent only years later: being a veteran astronaut with no history of serious adverse reactions to weightlessness offers no protection against becoming unexpectedly and violently spacesick.|$|E

[...] Fuller believed that the plot and ending [...] "only raised more questions than answers," [...] believing that the overarching storyline would [...] "require the audience's concentration over many weeks; any casual viewer tuning <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> and I suspect not a few fans, will have been left baffled by the goings-on," [...] but still felt the episode [...] "was interesting and showed just how, when the writers use their imagination, Doctor Who can tell stories in a way little else on television can." ...|$|E

Now there is only one scene in the piece, and that, my tarry lad, is the inside of a lighthouse. Will you come and paint it for us one night, and we'll all turn to and help? It is a mere wall, of course, but Mark and I have sworn that you must do it. If you will say yes, I should like to have the tiny flats made, after you have looked at the place, and not before.

60|$|The whole Persian fleet, {{manned by}} Phœnician sailors, {{and a huge}} army, under the two satraps Datis and Artaphernes, were on the {{opposite}} side of the Ægean Sea, ready to overwhelm little Attica first, and then all Greece. Nobody had yet stood firm against those all-conquering Persians, and as they came from island to island the inhabitants fled or submitted. Attica was so small as to have only 9000 fighting men to meet this host. They sent to ask the aid of the Spartans, but though these would have fought bravely, an old rule forbade them to march during the week before the full moon, and <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>week</b> Athens might be utterly ruined. Nobody did come to their help but 600 men from the very small state of Platæa, and this little army, not numbering 10,000, were encamped around the temple of Hercules, looking down upon the bay of Marathon, where lay the ships which had just landed at least 200,000 men of all the Eastern nations, and among them many of the Greeks of Asia Minor. The hills slant back so as to make a sort of horse-shoe round the bay, with about five miles of clear flat ground between them and the sea, and on this open space lay the Persians.|$|E
