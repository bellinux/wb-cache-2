The increased commissioning of wind power is being accompanied by record low prices for forthcoming renewable electric power.

For light, we can often neglect one dimension if the diffracting object extends in that direction over a distance far greater than the wavelength.

To pass the time, Skinner plays his professed favourite film, a very low-budget, long-running, 1938 holiday film called The Christmas That Almost Wasn't, But Then Was, which Lisa notices has {{very little to do with}} Christmas. By the time the movie is finally over, it <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>the</b> end of the school day, and Skinner lets the kids go home--however, Skinner and the students quickly realize that over the course of the day, the snow has piled up tremendously, leaving them and Groundskeeper Willie trapped inside the school, much to the horror of the kids.|$|E
