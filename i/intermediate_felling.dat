40|$|The project {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the accessibility of forest resources in Northwest (NW) Russia, the impacts of both Scandinavian and current Russian forest management and wood harvesting on ecologically, socially and economically sustainable forestry, and to enhance the development of sustainable forest management and wood harvesting methods for NW Russia. The research group found both positive trends, but also development needs in forest management in Northwest Russia. Since 1993, the area of lands without forest vegetation needing forest regeneration has decreased to a half. On the other hand, in 1999 - 2006 almost every fifth hectare of clear felling was left without active forest regeneration measures. Moreover, the extent of <b>intermediate</b> <b>felling</b> has been insufficient being only about fifth of the annual allowable area and 9 % of the total timber harvesting volume. Wood harvesting has been rather stable last 10 years in NW Russia, {{at the level of}} about 40 million m 3 per year. Less than half of the annual allowable cut is utilised and most of the round wood is produced by large and medium sized logging companies. Traditional full-tree and tree-length harvesting methods and systems are still dominating in most of the regions even though use of cut-to-length method is becoming more common. Several factors hamper development of wood harvesting, including for example weak production infrastructure, weak road network, lack of own turnover means in companies, low quality in harvester and forwarder operator trainging, and increasing variable costs. Scenario analysis indicate that mature and over mature forests in NW Russia are able to secure wood supply at the current levels for the next 50 years, but that intensification of forest management would allow to substantially increase annual fellings. The discrepancy between forest resources and their accessibility has been regarded as one main problem of forest management. Good infrastructure is essential for harvesting operations and thus the economic accessibility of forest resources...|$|E
40|$|Northwest Russia is {{the most}} {{important}} forest industry district producing 34 % of the merchantable wood, 32 % of the sawn wood, and 64 % of the paper in Russia in 2007. The combination of the rich and diverse forest resources, rather developed forest infrastructure, long forest industy history, and geographical location close to Western markets and the major domestic markets of St. Petersburg and Moscow increase its attractiveness both from the economic and ecological point of view. The purpose was therefore to overview the development of forest management and to describe the main tendencies of forest use, regeneration, and nature conservation for Russia in general and the Northwest in particular towards an intensive model of forest management for this area, which would cover the period from just {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union up to the passage of the new Forest Code in 2007. In the Northwest, forest use has been rather extensive during the period 1993 2006, on average, about 40 % of the allowable annual cut, which applies solely to final felling, was utlized. The actual volume of <b>intermediate</b> <b>felling</b> has been insignificant in comparison to what is needed to increase the quality of stands; in 2005 and 2006, it comprised about a tenth of the area and a third of the volume. In the area, during the period 1999 2006, almost every fifth hectare of clear felling was left without active forest regeneration measures. This development threatens the sustainability of forest management by reducing the quality of newly forming stands. The age-class structure is skewed due to this and other past forest management. More than half of the total area of coniferous forests is still composed of mature and overmature stands. These types of coniferous stands prevail in the Komi republic, and the Arkhangelsk and Murmansk regions, this is because of the economically limited accessibility and the significantly low productivity of these forest resources. Although the forests of Northwest Russia are of great economic importance, the issues of nature conservation and biodiversity in these forests are still highly recognised. In 2002, 28 % of the forested area belonged to different forest conservation categories of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} {{investigated}} the heterogeneity of borderline personality disorder (BPD) symptoms {{in a sample of}} 382 inner-city, predominantly African American male substance users through the use of latent class analysis. A 4 -class model was statistically preferred, with 1 class interpreted to be a baseline class, 1 class interpreted to be a high-BPD class, and 2 classes interpreted as intermediate classes. As a secondary goal, we examined the resulting BPD classes with respect to relevant clinical correlates, including temperamental vulnerabilities (affective instability, impulsivity, and interpersonal instability), childhood emotional abuse, drug choice, and co-occurring mood and anxiety disorders. The high-BPD class evidenced {{the highest levels of the}} temperamental vulnerabilities and environmental stressors, the baseline class evidenced the lowest levels, and the 2 <b>intermediate</b> classes <b>fell</b> in between. In addition, the high-BPD class had a higher probability of cocaine and alcohol dependence, as well as mood and anxiety disorders, than did the baseline class.

40|$|The Aerotest sampler (Olympic Medical Corp., Seattle, Wash.) is {{designed}} to detect bacterial contamination of respirator-generated aerosols in a simple one-step process. The sampler was evaluated by controlled contamination of Bennett AP- 5, PR- 2, and MA- 1 respirators with Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter. Bacteria present as viable 1. 4 to 3. 5 -mum particles in each of 77 aerosols were quantitated by using the Andersen viable-particle sampler, {{and the results were}} compared with those of colonies obtained from 10 -s or 15 -cycle Aerotest samples. All aerosols containing counts greater than expected in hospital air were detected by the Aerotest method. Thirteen of 14 aerosols containing less than 20 bacteria/ 0. 028 m 3 showed fewer than 5 colonies, whereas all aerosols containing greater than 1, 000 bacteria/ 0. 028 m 3 showed at least 40 colonies. Aerosols with <b>intermediate</b> counts <b>fell</b> in between. Under the conditions described here, the Aerotest sampler was able to discriminate between the low levels of bacteria commonly found in hospital air and the bacterial contamination associated with nosocomial pneumonia.

40|$|Stand {{treatment}} prescriptions in Lithuania {{are based}} on silvicultural traditions and biometric models, whereas application of economic models still is in its very infancy. The forest yield model of Kuliesis, pine assortment tables, observed timber prices, and costs of silvicultural treatments constitute sufficient information for optimizing silvicultural regimes in pine stands, using economic criteria, namely, forest rent, net present value, and soil expectation value. The dynamic programming approach enables simultaneous optimisation of <b>intermediate</b> and final <b>felling</b> throughout the rotation. Results obtained confirm that rotation ages differ according to site productivity. Optimal rotations range from 80 years in most productive stands to over 130 on the poorest sites, when the forest rent criterion is selected. The choice of thinning regimes is less obvious due to high sensitivity to timber prices, interest rates, and other factors...|$|R
40|$|In {{the decade}} of the 1990 s returns to {{schooling}} in Latin America became convex: the returns to Higher Education increased and the returns to Intermediate Education decreased. The double change in the returns was driven by a significant drop in the mean wage at <b>Intermediate</b> that <b>fell</b> below the level {{at the end of the}} 1980 s. The convexification has important implications for the evolution of wage inequality. Yet, no empirical study has developed a framework within which to study its determinants. This paper provides such a framework. I develop and simulate a dynamic general equilibrium model of savings and educational choices under credit constraints and uninsurable risk, in which ability is an important component of individuals’ earnings. I estimate the parameters of the model using micro data from Mexico. I specify a production function that allows for complementarities between Intermediate and Higher Education. I find that Intermediate Education is more complementary with Higher than with Basic Education. The simulations show that the convexification was not the result of a self-selection process of high ability individuals into Higher Education, but rather came about through changes in the prices of schooling due to changes in its supply. The change of the wage pro…le from linear to convex can be explained by an increase in the relative supply of Intermediate Educatio...|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} found a {{correlation}} between Pinus caribaea pollen morphology and viability. Eighteen different P. caribaea pollen families were screened {{to determine the effect}} of environmental conditions during storage on germination. The results indicated that there was a direct decrease in viability with an increase {{in the age of the}} pollen, temperature at which the pollen was stored, and exposure to high humidity during storage. Scanning electron microscopy was used to investigate the dimensions of the 18 families. Upon statistical analysis of the dimensional data, the families were found to group into three clusters. Pollen families displaying narrow germ furrows clustered with those displaying wide germ furrows, while those pollen families displaying intermediate germ furrows clustered into a second group. When the clusters were compared with the germination data obtained it was found that the pollen families displaying highest germination percentages <b>fell</b> into the <b>intermediate</b> cluster, while the pollen families displaying low to <b>intermediate</b> germination percentages <b>fell</b> into the narrow/wide cluster...|$|R
5000|$|Rogers {{returned}} from his knee injury from the previous season and started in the first game, a 16-7 loss to the New York Giants. [...] On September 21, he started the game vs. the Arizona Cardinals by jumping on an Edgerrin James fumble on the Cardinals 34 yard line {{in the first quarter}} which resulted in a Redskins field goal four plays later. He later made a diving interception against Kurt Warner of the Arizona Cardinals in the fourth quarter. Rogers then got to his feet, avoided a tackle by Larry Fitzgerald, and ran 42 yards to the 15-yard line. Two plays later, Santana Moss caught a short pass from Jason Campbell and scooted in 17 yards for the score, giving the Redskins a 24-17 victory. [...] The following game was at Texas Stadium vs. the Dallas Cowboys. Although Shawn Springs was assigned to cover the Cowboys #1 receiver, Terrell Owens, Springs became injured {{in the middle of the}} third quarter. With a three-point lead and the game on the line, the responsibility of covering T.O. on short to <b>intermediate</b> routes <b>fell</b> to Rogers. From that point forward, Rogers and the Washington defense held T.O. to two receptions on eight pass attempts, including three passes in a row from Tony Romo to T.O. into Rogers's coverage at the beginning of the 4th quarter - all incompletions. Redskins won 26-24 and the game was chosen as the NFL Films Game of the Week. Rogers acquired 7 tackles (6 solo) during the game, which was the high for the team that game and Rogers' high for the entire year. Rogers played in all 16 regular season games for the first time in his career, with 14 starts. He finished the season with 53 tackles (45 individual), two interceptions, 77 interception return yards and one fumble recovery.|$|R
40|$|The ATP-dependent binding of the {{simian virus}} 40 (SV 40) large tumor antigen (T antigen) to the SV 40 origin of {{replication}} (on) results in the structural distortion of two critical elements within flanking regions of on and the untwisting of the DNA helix. We examined the effect of changes in temperature, ATP concentration, and other reaction parameters on the generation of these DNA structural changes. We found that induction of the two localized structural transitions were highly and differentially sensitive to reaction conditions. Significant distortion of the early palindrome element, shown previously to result from DNA melting, required low levels of ATP (10 to 30,uM) but temperatures above 25 °C. Distortion of the AT tract occurred at low temperatures (5 °C) but required relatively high concentrations of ATP (> 300,LM). Thus, T antigen can induce structural changes within one critical element of on without generating significant structural distortion within the second element. The response of ori untwisting to reaction conditions generally increased in parallel with or <b>fell</b> <b>intermediate</b> between the inductions of localized structural transitions. We suggest that on untwisting and localized structural distortions are interdependent consequences of T-antigen binding to oni. These results suggest {{a model for the}} structural events occurring during the initial steps of SV 40 DNA replication. The initiation of DNA replication requires gross changes in the duplex DNA structure comprising the origin of repli...|$|R
40|$|Apolipoprotein E (apoE) {{is known}} to play an {{important}} role in lipoprotein metabolism. We have studied the effect of apoE on the metabolism of plasma cholesterol by injecting apoE intravenously into rabbits deficient in low density lipoprotein receptors [Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits]. Approximately 30 mg of apoE was injected per rabbit; a total of five WHHL rabbits were used. One hour later, plasma cholesterol levels fell 8. 3 % (from 488 +/- 192 to 446 +/- 174 mg/dl). After 3 hr, cholesterol levels had fallen by 19 % (to 392 +/- 152 mg/dl). The reduced levels were maintained for at least 8 hr after injection of apoE. Cholesterol in very low density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and <b>intermediate</b> density lipoproteins <b>fell</b> rapidly during the first 2 hr after injection, followed by a reduction in the low density lipoprotein cholesterol level. Changes in apolipoprotein B levels in each lipoprotein fraction were very similar to those of cholesterol. Plasma apoE levels 3 min after injection were elevated 3 -fold to 22. 8 +/- 6. 3 mg/dl and returned to initial levels 8 hr after injection. The rate of removal of intravenously injected 125 I-labeled VLDL that had been incubated with apoE was 3 -fold higher than that of unmodified VLDL. From these results, we conclude that the injected apoE is incorporated into VLDLs and that VLDL particles carrying more apoE are removed from the blood more rapidly, resulting in reduced formation of low density lipoprotein and lowered cholesterol levels...|$|R
40|$|Sidman's (2000) {{theory of}} {{stimulus}} equivalence predicts {{an interaction between}} the development of analytic units {{and the development of}} equivalence relations. Previous research has documented these interactions (stewart, Barnes-Holmes, Roche, & Smeets, 2002; Vaidya & Brackney, 2014), therefore the current study attempted to replicate the effects seen in Vaidya & Brackney, 2014 (Experiment 2). Baseline conditional discriminations were trained for two sets of three, three-member classes, while participants simply observed stimuli in the third set which was arranged identical to those of Sets 1 and 2. Following equivalence tests where performance met the accuracy criterion of 85 % for Sets 1 and 2, participants then entered a simple successive discrimination training phase where common responses were then trained with an equivalence class (pressing the Q key in the presence of A 1, B 1, or C 1), cross equivalence classes (pressing the R key in the presence of A 4, A 5, or A 6), or for stimuli where the participants had experience with them, but the contingencies were never arranged to facilitate equivalence class formation. Results showed a facilitative effect for common responses drawn from within equivalence classes (Set 1), and a retardation effect for common responses drawn from across equivalence classes (Set 2), for three of the five participants. Results for Set 3 showed an acquisition that <b>fell</b> <b>intermediate</b> to that of Sets 1 and 2, respectively, suggesting an interaction occurring between existing equivalence relations and the development of analytic units...|$|R
40|$|Homeless and {{marginally}} housed individuals {{constitute a}} socially impoverished population characterized by {{high rates of}} multimorbid illness that includes polysubstance use, viral infection, and psychiatric illness. Their extensive exposure to risk factors is associated with numerous poor outcomes, yet {{little is known about}} structural brain integrity and its association with neurocognition in this population. In Study 1, we conducted a cluster analysis to re-construct three previously derived subgroups with distinct neurocognitive profiles in a large sample of socially marginalized persons (N = 299). Cluster 1 (n = 87) was characterized as highest functioning overall, whereas Cluster 3 (n = 103) was the lowest functioning neurocognitively, with a relative strength in decision-making. Cluster 2 (n = 109) <b>fell</b> <b>intermediate</b> to the other subgroups, with a relative weakness in decision-making. Next, we examined the association between complementary fronto-temporal cortical brain measures (gyrification, cortical thickness) and neurocognitive profiles using multinomial logistic regression. Chi-square tests and ANOVAs differentiated subgroups on proxy measures of neurodevelopment and acquired brain insult/risk exposure. We found that greater frontal and temporal gyrification and more proxies of aberrant neurodevelopment were associated with Cluster 3 (lowest functioning subgroup). Further, age moderated the association between orbitofrontal cortical thickness and neurocognition, with positive associations in older adults, and negative associations in younger adults. Finally, greater acquired brain insult/risk exposure was associated with the cluster characterized by selective decision-making impairment (Cluster 2), and the higher functioning cluster (Cluster 1). In Study 2, we examined the association between white matter integrity and neurocognitive profiles using multinomial logistic regression and Tract-based Spatial Statistics. We found significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA), with corresponding increased axial and radial diffusivity (AD, RD) in widespread and bilateral brain regions of Cluster 3. Differences in RD were more prominent compared to AD. Altogether, our findings highlight the unique pathways to neurocognitive impairment in a heterogeneous population and help to clarify the vulnerabilities confronted by different subgroups...|$|R
