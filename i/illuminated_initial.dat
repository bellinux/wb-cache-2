50|$|The Conradin Bible is an {{illuminated}} manuscript likely produced in central or southern Italy around 1265. It is {{usually associated with}} its namesake, Conradin, king of Sicily (1254-68). It was originally a large codex illustrated with 57 miniatures and numerous historiated and <b>illuminated</b> <b>initials</b> in a High Romanesque style with Byzantine influences.

50|$|Over the years, the {{manuscript}} has suffered {{at the hands}} of thieves and collectors. Some nine <b>illuminated</b> <b>initials</b> and at least one full-page illustration have been removed entirely.

Another missing leaf, showing scenes from the lives of Samuel on the recto and of King David on the verso, is now in the Morgan Library and is commonly referred to as the Morgan Leaf. Whether other similar full-page miniatures have been removed is unknown.|$|R
5000|$|The Hereford Gospels (Hereford, Hereford Cathedral Library, MS P.

50|$|The {{two most}} famous {{illuminated}} pages {{are at the}} start of the manuscript and are illustrated here and discussed below.

50|$|The Greek uncial (lettering type) {{is used in}} many manuscripts of the 9th and 10th centuries; and the Latin uncial is also employed, {{especially}} in Gaul, far into the Middle Ages for Gospel and liturgical works. The copying of the Gospels influenced largely the writings of Irish and Anglo-Saxon scribes, and effected the spread of these characters over the European continent {{and the development of}} the Caroline minuscule and the semi-uncial of the school of Tours. The copyists of the Gospels made great use of other helps to beautify their penmanship, {{such as the use of}} purple parchment, liquid gold and silver and various coloured inks. The part played by Evangeliaria in the history of miniature painting until the twelfth and thirteenth centuries is very great. Especially noteworthy are the miniature insets to the Canons of Eusebius, or tables of Gospel concordance. <b>Illuminated</b> <b>initial</b> letters differed according to the various schools of writing; the Irish scribes used artistic knots and loops, the Merovingian and Lombard writers preferred animal forms, especially fish.|$|E
5000|$|The book {{opens with}} an {{illustrated}} calendar, each month {{beginning with the}} historiated letters [...] "KL", an abbreviation for kalenda, i.e. {{the first day of}} the month. Then follow thirteen pages of prefactory full-page miniatures, two scenes to a page, with three pages of Old Testament scenes, six of scenes from the Life of Christ (further pages are perhaps missing), and, unusually for this date, three from the Life of the Virgin, including a Death of the Virgin, with a funeral procession, and an Assumption. These are the earliest English miniatures to have gold leaf backgrounds incised with patterns of lines and dots. After these pages there is an opening with full-page miniatures of David playing his harp and a Beatus initial for the start of Psalm 1 ("Beatus vir"). All the psalms have a large <b>illuminated</b> <b>initial,</b> often historiated, and each verse starts with an enlarged gold initial. The start of the ten traditional divisions of the text have especially large initials, as is usually the case.|$|E

50|$|Beginning in {{the late}} Middle Ages manuscripts began to be {{produced}} on paper. Very early printed books were sometimes produced with spaces left for rubrics and miniatures, or were given <b>illuminated</b> <b>initials,</b> or decorations in the margin, but the introduction of printing rapidly led to the decline of illumination. Illuminated manuscripts continued to be produced in the early 16th century, but in much smaller numbers, mostly for the very wealthy. Manuscripts {{are among the most}} common items to survive from the Middle Ages; many thousands survive. They are also the best surviving specimens of medieval painting, and the best preserved. Indeed, for many areas and time periods, they are the only surviving examples of painting.|$|R
5000|$|Close {{analysis}} of these illuminations reveals a gradual transformation from the conventional and textually unrelated images that were common {{at the time and}} that are found {{at the beginning of the}} manuscript (the famous frontispiece is an exception, having been added later) to largely unique and textually based ones further on. This indicates a change in attitude toward the <b>illuminated</b> <b>initial</b> on the part of the artist only after production had begun, something that was not part of the original conception. More specifically, after initially illuminating this patristic work in a conventional and unexceptional manner in the illuminations in the beginning of the book, the artist gradually began to internalize the exegetical principals laid out by Gregory in the Letter to Leander (that is part of the prefatory matter of the book), in particular, Gregory's demand that one [...] "become" [...] what one reads. In the same way that Gregory found it acceptable to analyze a line or even a word of text out of context, according to modern sensibilities, so the artist was quite willing to do the same, often with reference to the contemporary monastic polemics of reform. The end result was the exegetical spiritualization of the first generation Cistercian experience, the visual expression of Gregory's exegetical method.|$|E
5000|$|An {{example of}} this {{may be found in}} the <b>illuminated</b> <b>initial</b> [...] "I" [...] to Book Twenty-one (Dijon, Bibliothèque municipale, ms 173:41). The initial depicts a tattered monk with his knife in his belt and his {{leggings}} slipping down, chopping away {{at the base of a}} tree that is unusually large for a medieval manuscript and that forms the body of the initial. Meanwhile, above, a layman is also busy cutting, but this time branch by branch. One of the main themes of Book Twenty-one is the importance of the avoidance of temptation. According to Gregory, the senses of the body are the windows of the soul, and it is by thoughtlessly looking out through these windows that a person may fall into the pleasure of sin—especially lust—through desire, even though this was against the person's original intention and even though the person never actually acts upon that desire (Moralia 21:4-5). It is for this reason that such danger should be anticipated and the source of such temptation—in this passage, primarily women—be avoided, even if this only involves the sense of sight and nothing more. As an example of the seriousness of the role of the sense of sight in the process of sin, Gregory points out that [...] "Eve would not have touched the forbidden tree if she had not first thoughtlessly looked at it." [...] And so in the initial to this book, the ragged monk cuts the tree of temptation in accordance with the biblical injunction, [...] "at the root" [...] (Mat. 3:10, Lk. 3:9). That is, he cuts himself off from the sight of all such temptations by fleeing the world and seeking shelter in monastic seclusion. The layman, in conceptual antithesis to the monk, cuts the tree branch by branch while perched precariously in its midst, ignoring his impending doom as implied in the inevitable fall of the tree. In other words, the pious lay person is contented with half measures by continuing to live [...] "in the world" [...] and will inevitably pay the price for that decision.|$|E
40|$|The article explores {{iconography}} of the <b>illuminated</b> <b>initial</b> {{letters in the}} tenth-eleventh-century Italo-Byzantine psalter (Vatican, Barber. gr. 285).

25|$|Three {{examples}} of early English printing were {{donated to the}} Library by Gwendoline and Margaret Davies of Gregynog in 1921. Two of these books were printed by William Caxton: Speculum Vitae Christi of 1488, and the copy of Ranulf Higden's Polychronicon (1482) {{that had previously been}} the property of Higden's Monastery, St. Werburgh's Abbey at Chester. The third is another copy of the Polychronicon, printed by Caxton's successor Wynkyn de Worde in 1495. Nine specimens of early printed books (three German, five Italian and one printed in Ghent) were deposited by Lord Harlech between 1938 and 1941. Other notable incunabula in the Library are the Astronomica by Marcus Manilius (1474) with <b>illuminated</b> <b>initials</b> and borders, and Hartmann Schedel's Liber Chronicarum (1493).|$|R

50|$|The Hamburg Bible is {{a richly}} {{illuminated}} Latin Bible in three very large volumes {{made for the}} Cathedral of Hamburg in 1255. As {{a witness to the}} medieval book culture in Europe, it is a monument in its own right. It {{is the result of a}} small group of highly talented clergy- and craftsmen who not only exercised their skills to an extraordinary perfection, but also allowed themselves - or were allowed - to show their fascination of their own craft. The 89 <b>illuminated</b> <b>initials</b> contained in the three volumes illustrate themes of biblical books, with one illustrating the production of the medieval book, from the manufacturing of parchment at the beginning of the process to the illumination of initial letters when the work approached completion. The images are unique both as expressions of medieval art and as sources to the craft and history of the medieval book.|$|R
