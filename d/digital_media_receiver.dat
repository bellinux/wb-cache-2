40|$|<b>Media</b> extenders or <b>digital</b> <b>media</b> <b>receivers</b> are {{network devices}} {{that are used}} to {{retrieve}} <b>digital</b> <b>media</b> files (such as music, pictures, or video) from a media server and play or show them on a TV or home theater system. A technology that is often associated with these devices is the Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) technology. This technology enables network devices to be used without requiring the user to do network configuration on it. This thesis demonstrates how a device that is normally used for receiving digital television broadcasts can be enhanced to support media extender functionality. The thesis describes the design and implementation of the technologies that are needed to accomplish this functionality. The main topics are centered around on how UPnP awareness and media rendering (decoding) are incorporated into the device...|$|R

5000|$|WMC is a UPnP AV server {{that can}} make media files stored on a {{computer}} available to UPnP AV-compatible <b>digital</b> <b>media</b> <b>receiver</b> clients over a local area network. WMC advertises itself to the clients, {{so there is no}} need to manually configure the client to connect to the WMC server. Multiple WMC instances can run at a time, all will be accessible to a client. Any UPnP AV client can be used to access WMC shared media. The client can query WMC for the list of files shared, the result of the query is formatted using XML. Once it chooses from the list the media to be played, the media file is streamed to the client for playing. Pictures are streamed using HTTP, different protocols are used for music and video. A client supporting the UPnP Media Renderer standard will be able to render the stream.|$|E

40|$|An IPTV Set-top box {{enables the}} {{possibility}} of doing much more than decodingtelevision content. Its Ethernet interface gives it the same possibilities to communicatewith the outside world as any network device. This enables a wide rangeof services from internet radio to acting as a <b>digital</b> <b>media</b> <b>receiver</b> in your homenetwork. These highly interactive services increase the demands for responsiveand visually attractive user interfaces. Due to the cost-sensitive market of IPTV STBs the preferred platform to developthe user interface is the HTML browser as it allows for fast developmenttimes and low costs. As a W 3 C standard it also offers high portability and hardwareabstraction {{making it easy to}} use more than one STB vendor. The cons ofHTML based GUIs are low performance and lacklustre graphics. This thesis aims to find out if SVG can be used to achieve rich, scalable and animatedgraphics with high performance and still keep the attractive characteristicsof HTML. To do this much effort was put into identifying the strenghts and weaknesses ofSVG. The lessons learned resulted in an SVG AJAX framework called TOIXSVGmaking it possible to develop SVG GUIs {{in the same manner as}} modern Rich InternetApplications, enabling component reuse to make sure development time scalespreferably with the scope and complexity of the user interface. Along with theframework several new widgets had to be developed to achieve the targeted functionality. As a proof of concept a mock-up GUI was created with the frameworkand widgets...|$|E
