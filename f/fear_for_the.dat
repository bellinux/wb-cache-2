5|$|The {{novel was}} adapted as the 1993 movie Schindler's List by Steven Spielberg. After {{acquiring}} the rights in 1983, Spielberg {{felt he was}} not ready emotionally or professionally to tackle the project, and he offered the rights to several other directors. After he read a script for the project prepared by Steven Zaillian for Martin Scorsese, he decided to trade him Cape <b>Fear</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to do the Schindler biography. In the film, the character of Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) is a composite of Stern, Bankier, and Pemper. Liam Neeson was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Schindler in the film, which won seven Oscars, including Best Picture.|$|E
5|$|A {{tattoo on}} his arm {{identifies}} Tom Nero, and the rope still around his neck shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown {{to have as much}} feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; his eye is put out just as his horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one {{of its kind in the}} first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the <b>fear</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> audience. Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate.|$|E
5|$|Macrinus' {{predecessor}} Caracalla {{was murdered}} on April 8, 217, {{during a period}} of war with the Parthians, near Carrhae while traveling en-route to visit a temple. His murderer was Justin Martialus, a soldier who was incensed after being declined the rank of centurion. Martialus was himself cut down by Caracalla's German Guards immediately afterwards, a convenient fact for Macrinus, at the time a Praetorian prefect, who was involved in the assassination. One reason for Macrinus to have intrigued against Caracalla was out of <b>fear</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> security of his own life. A story documented by Roman writer Herodian and supported by some later historians details the events leading to Caracalla's death. The story goes that Macrinus, {{in the course of his}} employment, was often tasked with reading dispatches sent to Caracalla for him. One such dispatch detailed a prophecy, perhaps fabricated, from the oracle at Delphi suggesting that Macrinus was destined to kill Caracalla and succeed him as the next emperor.|$|E

25|$|Meles' {{policy of}} ethnic {{federalism}} has {{been attacked by}} two groups of opposition parties. Pan-Ethiopian opposition parties like AEUP, UEDP-medhin and Andenet accused Meles of harming the stability and unity of Ethiopia by dividing the country on language lines. They expressed their <b>fear</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> future unity of the country, pointing out a rise in ethnic conflicts after the ethnic federalism policy introduced, whereas in the past Ethiopia's economic marginalization of groups or ethnicities was a cause of warfare in the country, as experts indicated.|$|E

When Caesar's troops hesitated to leave their ships for fear of the Britons, the aquilifer of the tenth legion threw himself overboard and, carrying the eagle, advanced alone against the enemy. His comrades, fearing disgrace, 'with one accord, leapt down from the ship' and were followed by troops from the other ships.|$|E

The term of five years' imprisonment was reduced to {{three and a half years}} because of the terrifying threats made by a man determined to dominate and control the defendant's life. The threats created a genuine <b>fear</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> safety of herself and more significantly, her daughter, and this caused the defendant to lose control and make the ferocious attack.|$|E
25|$|Butler {{soon had}} to return many of his men to Washington in order to {{reinforce}} the defeated Union force after the First Battle of Bull Run as <b>fear</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> security of the capital ran high. While Butler continued to maintain the camp at Newport News, he had to abandon the camp at Hampton for lack of men. When Magruder discovered this, on August 7, 1861, a Confederate force burned Hampton so it {{could no longer be}} used to shelter runaway slaves. Butler did not attempt to shell the Confederates from the fort for fear he would be blamed, at least in part, for the burning of the town due to cannon fire.|$|E
25|$|On 1 November 1755, {{on the day}} of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, the Royal Family was in Belém, {{and escaped}} the {{destruction}} of Lisbon by the earthquake and tsunami. Perturbed by the events, King Joseph refused to live under a residence of masonry, and took refuge in a wooden shack next to the Palace of the Counts of Óbidos (packed with tapestries from the Quinta de Baixo). As the Royal family continued to <b>fear</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> viability of the Ribeira Palace in Lisbon, the King ordered the construction of a more permanent wooden building in the heights of Alto da Ajuda; the architects Petrónio Mazzoni and Veríssimo Jorge began building an elaborate structure from wood collected from the Vale de Figueira pinery. The Real Barraca (Royal Tent), or Paço de Madeira (Wooden Palace) was completed on 20 September 1761 (and the first baptism was held in its chapel), but, owing to a risk of collapse, the theatre (which was considered a risk by architect João Carlos Bibiena) was reconstructed from 1767 to 1786 by Giacomo Azzolini. The court remained at this site for nearly three decades, in a luxurious atmosphere of the golden age of enlightened despotism, until the King's death in 1777. Since his successor, Queen Maria I of Portugal lived with Peter III in the Palace of Queluz at the time of Joseph's death, the Royal Barraca was vacated.|$|E

25|$|Cooper {{falls in}} love with a new girl in town, Annie Blackburn. When Annie wins the Miss Twin Peaks contest, Earle kidnaps her and takes her to the Black Lodge {{entrance}} in Glastonbury Grove. Cooper realizes that Earle's real reason for being in Twin Peaks is to gain entrance into the Black Lodge and harness its power for himself, and that his chess game has been an elaborate decoy. With clues from Deputy Andy and the Log Lady, Cooper discovers the entrance to the Lodge, which turns out to be the red-curtained room from his dream. He is greeted by the Man From Another Place, the Giant, and the spirit of Laura Palmer, who each give Cooper coded prophecies about his future and demonstrate the properties of the Black Lodge, which defies the laws of time and space. Searching for Annie and Earle, Cooper encounters doppelgängers of various dead people, including Maddy Ferguson and Leland Palmer, who taunt him with strange denials, warnings, and falsehoods. The doppelgängers eventually lead Cooper to Earle, who demands that Cooper give up his soul in exchange for Annie's life. Cooper agrees and Earle stabs him. Seconds later, Killer Bob appears and reverses time in the Lodge. Bob tells Cooper that Earle cannot ask for his soul and then kills Earle and takes his soul. Bob then turns on Cooper, who experiences <b>fear</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time in the Lodge. Cooper flees, pursued by Bob and a doppelgänger of himself.|$|E

500|$|Thomas Bayard's {{return to}} Wilmington in 1858 brought greater {{involvement}} in the political scene.

[...] When the convention deadlocked and the Southern Democrats split from the main party, James Bayard adhered to the regular Democrats, but told Thomas that he thought the nominee, Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, was untrustworthy. [...] The subsequent election of Republican Abraham Lincoln and secession of the seven states of the Deep South led both Bayards to <b>fear</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> future of the Union, and the elder Bayard to propose a convention of all the states to resolve their differences. [...] In the meantime, as four more Southern states seceded, James Bayard encouraged his son to help organize an independent militia unit, the Delaware Guard; Thomas Bayard was commissioned as its First Lieutenant.|$|E
