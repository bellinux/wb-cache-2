5|$|Subtropical Storm One was a {{short-lived}} subtropical cyclone that brought copious amounts of rainfall to central Florida in late June 1974. The storm originated {{in an area}} of convection that detached from a tropical depression over the southwestern Gulf of Mexico on June24. A new area of low pressure developed underneath the convection and the system began to intensify. Later that day, the storm had become sufficiently organized to be classified as a subtropical depression. Early on June25, it made landfall near Clearwater, <b>Florida</b> <b>with</b> winds of 50mph (85km/h) and later attained its peak intensity over eastern <b>Florida</b> <b>with</b> winds of 65mph (100km/h). After reemerging into the Atlantic Ocean, the system began to weaken as it underwent an extratropical transition. The storm ultimately dissipated off the coast of North Carolina early on June26.|$|E
