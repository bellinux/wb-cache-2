5|$|The first {{televised}} {{match was}} between Tatanka and Bam Bam Bigelow. Bigelow tried to attack Tatanka before the bell, but Tatanka moved. The two fought back and forth, and Bigelow gained momentum after Tatanka missed a crossbody {{from the top}} turnbuckle. Bigelow used his weight to keep the advantage, sitting on Tatanka and later using a bear <b>hug</b> <b>to</b> wear him down. After the two hit each other with simultaneous crossbodies, Tatanka began a war dance. Bigelow kicked Tatanka {{in the back of}} the head to regain the advantage but missed a moonsault attempt from the top rope, allowing Tatanka to perform a crossbody from the corner and get the victory.|$|E

The fight was even going into the latter stages of round two when Bernardo landed a right hook which sent <b>Hug</b> <b>to</b> the canvas. He {{was able to make}} it back to his feet but was clearly on wobbly legs and the referee in charge, Genshu Igari, stopped him from taking any more damage than was necessary.|$|E

They would then rematch {{at the same}} stage of the 4th European Kyokushin Championships in Katowice, Poland in May 1987 with the Englishman again coming out on top and forcing <b>Hug</b> <b>to</b> relinquish his title as European champion. Andy Hug returned to the World Open in November 1987 and made history by becoming the first gaijin to reach {{the final of the}} tournament, booking his place with a judges' decision win over Akira Masuda in the semis. There, he again faced Shokei Matsui and lost to his Japanese foe by decision once again.|$|E

25|$|At the K-1 Grand Prix '98 Final Round on December 13, 1998, he TKO'd Ray Sefo in {{the second}} round of their quarter-final match, {{knocking}} the New Zealander down twice with aggressive boxing combinations and forcing referee Nobuaki Kakuda to stop the fight, before securing a majority decision against Sam Greco in the semis, a rematch of their draw a year earlier. There was also some controversy in the fight as both men continued to fight after the bell rung at the end of round two, with Greco knocking <b>Hug</b> <b>to</b> the canvas with a right hand. The tournament final saw Andy Hug draw Peter Aerts once again and in their fourth and final match against one another, Aerts emerged victorious via head kick knockout in the first round.|$|E
2500|$|Kicking off {{the most}} {{successful}} year of his career, Andy Hug demolished an overmatched Bart Vale at the K-1 Grand Prix '96 Opening Battle on March 3, 1996 {{to qualify for the}} K-1 Grand Prix '96 which was held two months later on May 6. After making short work of Duane van der Merwe with a KO inside forty seconds at the tournament's quarter-final stage, awaiting Hug was Ernesto Hoost in the semis and the pair had an epic battle considered {{to be one of the}} greatest matches in K-1's history. A back-and-forth fight in which Hoost delivered punishing low kicks throughout and both fighters traded heavily in the clinch, the judges ruled it a split draw after the regulation three rounds and so it went to an extension round to decide the winner only for it again to be scored a majority draw. Finally, after five grueling rounds, Hug was ruled the victor by split decision. In the final, he went up against Mike Bernardo, the South African power puncher who had knocked him out twice previously. It was not to be three-in-a-row for Bernardo, however, as a combination of fatigue and Hug's low kicks began to wear him down in the second round. Bernardo went down from a roundhouse kick to his left thigh but got back to his feet only for <b>Hug</b> <b>to</b> deliver one of the most spectacular stoppages of the 1990s, landing the [...] "Hug Tornado" [...] on Bernardo's already-injured left leg to put him away and clinch the coveted K-1 World Grand Prix Championship.|$|E

60|$|The long, long {{thoughts}} of boyhood! We elders smile at them. The little world spins round; the little voices {{of an hour}} sink hushed. The crawling generations come and go.

60|$|There {{would be}} no rescue, of course. That was the penalty paid for the high profits which {{unrestrained}} competition could lead to. The Merchant who opened a new planet could have a ten year monopoly of its trade, which he might <b>hug</b> <b>to</b> himself or, more likely, rent out to all comers at a stiff price. It followed that planets were searched for in secrecy and, preferably, away from the usual trade routes.

His hands were free, however, and the savage was compelled to relinquish his <b>hug,</b> <b>to</b> keep his own face above the surface.

What might have been the issue of this severe personal struggle cannot be known, for half a dozen savages came leaping into the water to the aid of their friend, and Deerslayer yielded himself a prisoner, with a dignity that was as remarkable as his self-devotion.|$|E

She looked like an animated package of cheap cotton goods! It made him furious. She had disguised herself so because a man of her race was near! He told her not to do it, and she did not obey. Would his ideas ever change so as to agree with her own notions of what was becoming, proper and respectable? He was really afraid they would, in time. It seemed to him awful. She would never change! This manifestation of her sense of proprieties was another sign of their hopeless diversity; something like another step downwards for him. She was too different from him. He was so civilized! It struck him suddenly that they had nothing in common--not a thought, not a feeling; he could not make clear to her the simplest motive of any act of his [...] . and he could not live without her.|$|E
