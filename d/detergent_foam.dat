5000|$|The famous {{scene in}} which Ann-Margret's {{character}} hallucinates that she is cavorting in <b>detergent</b> <b>foam,</b> baked beans, and chocolate reportedly took three days to shoot. According to Russell, the detergent and baked bean sequences were [...] "revenge" [...] parodies of real-life TV advertisements he had directed early in his career, although the baked bean sequence also references one of the cover photos and a parody radio ad from The Who's 1967 album The Who Sell Out. Russell also recalled that Ann-Margret's husband, Roger Smith, strongly objected to the {{scene in which}} she slithers around in melted chocolate. During the filming, Ann-Margret accidentally struck {{her hand on the}} broken glass of the TV screen, causing a severe laceration, and Russell had to take her to hospital to have the wound stitched, although she was back on set the next day. [...] The film also includes a scene in which Mrs. Walker watches a parodic TV advertisement for the fictional product [...] "Rex Baked Beans"; the costumes in this segment were originally made for the lavish masked ball sequence in Richard Lester's version of The Three Musketeers, and the dress worn by the Queen in the Rex ad is that worn by Geraldine Chaplin in the earlier film.|$|E
40|$|The {{challenges}} for efficient bioprocesses lie {{in developing and}} adapting further current technologies or in creating innovative separation technologies. The thesis {{is based on the}} studies on protein recovery from crude feedstocks by extraction in aqueous two-phase systems and <b>detergent</b> <b>foam,</b> respectively. The separation technologies have been adapted to suit individual proteins by utilizing different forms of molecular interactions and environmental changes in a very simple way. Interaction of the lipolytic enzyme, cutinase with it's substrate, butyrate resulted in sufficient conformational changes to change it's extraction behavior in a polyethylene glycol (PEG) /salt system. The ability of the polymer, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to complex reactive dyes and metal ions was used to set up a selective extraction process for the proteins (porcine Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and His 6 -LDH) binding these entities in a two-phase system employing PVP as one of the phase forming components. Extraction in aqueous two-phase systems was found to be an efficient separation technique for cold-active, highly labile enzyme molecules. Cold-active ß-galactosidase was purified with high yields using extraction as a primary separation sep. In case of cold-active ß-lactamase cloned in a mesophilic host, partial denaturation of the labile enzyme under conditions when the host proteins were still intact, allowed selective extraction in a PEG/salt system. Foam, generated by stirring of a non-ionic detergent Triton X- 114 was used as a separation tool for isolation of cutinase mutants. The mutant with the hydrophobic fusion tag, (Trp-Pro) 4 was recovered with high yields due to the stronger interaction with the detergent. Protein extraction into the foam was made more selective by integration of affinity interactions. The foam prepared from detergent modified with Cibacron blue could selectively extract hydrophilic LDH from muscle extract. The thermoseparating property of Triton X- 114 further helped easy separation of the target enzyme from the bulk detergent...|$|E

40|$|Five {{hundred and}} fifty-five acid workers were {{examined}} between March 1962 and October 1964. One hundred and seventy-six (31 · 7 %) {{were affected by}} industrial dental erosion at the first examinations. In 33 cases (6 · 0 %) the dentine was affected. During {{the period of the}} survey, 66 (20 · 4 %) of 324 workers examined more than once showed evidence that erosion was progressing. The prevalence and incidence of erosion were highest among battery formation workers, lower among picklers, and least among other processes covered by the survey. The age of workers did not appear to influence their susceptibility to erosion. The habit of working with the lips slightly parted had little effect. Erosion superimposed upon attrition predisposed to more severe loss of tooth structure than either operating alone. Little inconvenience or functional disability was suffered by acid workers due to erosion. Twenty-seven (23 · 7 %) of 114 erosions were considered to be disfiguring. Regular dental treatment was sought less by acid workers than by controls, and the oral hygiene of the latter was superior. There was no evidence to show any difference between caries experience among acid workers and controls. Calculus and periodontal disease were more prevalent among acid workers than among controls, but {{it was not possible to}} attribute this to the working environment. Black staining in iron picklers was considered to be due to the working environment. The use of closed acid containers or lip extraction on open acid vats prevented significant atmospheric contamination and diminished the prevalence of erosion.

50|$|In most {{household}} contexts, {{the term}} detergent by itself refers specifically to laundry detergent or dish detergent, {{as opposed to}} hand soap or other types of cleaning agents. Detergents are commonly available as powders or concentrated solutions. Detergents, like soaps, work because they are amphiphilic: partly hydrophilic (polar) and partly hydrophobic (non-polar). Their dual nature facilitates the mixture of hydrophobic compounds (like oil and grease) with water. Because air is not hydrophilic, <b>detergents</b> are also <b>foaming</b> agents to varying degrees.|$|R

40|$|We have {{developed}} a series of sustainable peptide surfactants (Pepfactants) capable of stabilizing foams and emulsions in a stimuli-responsive manner, based on the reversible formation of a mechanically strong interfacial film. Under conditions where the interfacially adsorbed peptide forms a mechanically strong film state, foam or emulsion stabilization occurs {{as a direct result}} of the film strength. Under conditions where the interfacially adsorbed peptide forms a mobile <b>detergent</b> state, <b>foam</b> or emulsion stabilization is either reduced, or does not occur. Preformed foams or emulsions stabilized by Pepfactants undergo rapid phase coalescence when the film state is converted to the detergent state. Switching between film and detergent states is readily and reversibly achieved by a change in the bulk solution composition, such as a change in pH, or the addition or sequestering of metal ions.

30|$|Water use for {{drinking}} and domestic purposes {{will depend on}} hardness (Karanth 1987). Hardness of water could be temporal due {{to the presence of}} carbonate and bicarbonate and permanent, if sulphates and chlorides of calcium and magnesium exist (Fig.  4). The high concentrations of calcium and magnesium are traceable to the siltstones and other calcic and dolomitic components present in the area (Ebong et al. 2014; Haritash et al. 2008). Schroeder (1960) reported that hard water can cause some heart diseases and also requires more <b>detergents</b> to <b>foam.</b> The maximum permissible limit of total hardness {{for drinking}} is 500  mg/l and the WHO desirable limit is 100  mg/l. The TH classification based on Sawyer and McCartly (1967) showed that BH 1, BH 4, and BH 10 which constitute 30  % and BH 5, BH 6, and BH 8 (30  %) of the water are hard and moderately hard, respectively. BH 2, BH 3, BH 7, and BH 9 (i.e., 40  %) are soft (Table  3).|$|R

40|$|N-acyl {{amino acids}} are {{attractive}} anionic surfactant molecules. They {{are made up}} of an amino acid as polar head chemically linked via an amide bond to a linear fatty acid (Bordes et al, 2015). These surfactants, especially glutamate derivates, have been several times proposed in cosmetics as promising <b>detergents</b> and <b>foaming</b> agents. Generally, they are referred as “mild surfactants” because less irritant and commonly considered safer than sulfates, the most used anionic surfactants e. g. sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). Anionic surfactants are also commonly employed in several pharmaceutical formulations and SDS is still the most used anionic surfactant despite its not favorable toxicological profile. N-acyl amino acid surfactants could represent an alternative option to SDS. However, most of the potentialities of such surfactants as pharmaceutical excipients remained unexplored. Several studies have demonstrated the effect of SDS as permeability enhancer for the oral route using Caco- 2 cell monolayer (Deli M. A, 2009; Anderberg E. K., 1993). However, its use has surely been limited by toxicity concerns. The aim of this work was to investigate the cell viability profiles (MTS assay) on Caco- 2 cell of N-acyl surfactants derived from alanine and serine, in comparison to SDS. Moreover, their ability to modulate transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and affect the permeability of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) labeled dextran as model drug across Caco- 2 cell monolayer was evaluated at non-toxic concentrations (100 % of cell viability) as determined by MTS assay...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to assess extemporaneous in vivo binding between 99 m TcO 4 - and two sclerosant <b>detergents</b> in <b>foam</b> sclerotherapy, and {{subsequently}} to control any possible damage in lungs and other organs related to sclerosant foam passage. A prospective comparative pilot study was performed on two male patients (62 and 56 years old) affected by varicose veins; each of them underwent scintigraphy investigations with free radiotracer and a scintigraphy investigation after each of the four sessions of sclerotherapy of varicose tributaries of the lower limbs with labeled sclerosant foam. One of the two patients underwent two further scintigraphic investigations, with free radiotracer and with labeled sclerosant foam, at a later stage. Four mL of 2 % polidocanol (POL) foam, or four mL of 1 % sodiumtetradecylsulfate (STS) foam for session were injected. The sclerosant foam was labeled with the radioactive tracer technetium pertechnetate, 99 m TcO 4 - (120 MBq per exam). Two scintigraphy assessments for free tracer (basal) and five scintigraphy investigations of bound-tosclerosant tracer uptake/transit were obtained. No relevant variations in time/activity curves of the lungs and other organs were documented between the basal and post-sclerotherapy findings, also at the later stage. Free radiotracer mean region-of-interest data were: 336 counts (heart), 208 counts (lungs) and 371 counts (thyroid). Mean values extrapolated from each curve at each step for labeled CO 2 O 2 -based sclerosant foam were respectively: 351 counts (POL) and 328 counts (STS) for heart, 202 counts (POL) and 188 counts (STS) for lungs, 335 (POL) and 263 (STS) for thyroid.

40|$|Most of {{the common}} foams are a {{two-phase}} medium of gas and liquid with a particular structure consisting of gas pockets trapped in a network of thin liquid lms and plateau borders. Some well known foams are bubble baths, dishwater <b>detergents</b> and the <b>foam</b> head on beers. Many oils foam when trapped gas is suddenly released under conditions of an abrupt drop in pressure. In some re ners in which the through- ow of gas at high temperature and pressure is required to crack hydrocarbons, the gas-liquid mixtures will foam strongly. The foam traps gas with gas fractions of 80 % or higher. Clearly in such situations, {{in which it is}} desired that solid catalysts contact liquids, the production of foam is not wanted. In other applications, foams are useful; for example foams which havea high yield stress and {{can be used in a}} uid for carrying particles in applications ranging from the transport of cuttings in drilling and the placement of sands in cracks in oil producing reservoirs to increase the conductivity of reservoirs for secondary oil recovery. Obviously, bubble bath and shampoo companies should like to produce appropriate foams for dish and hair washing. Technologies which are impacted by foams and foaming are widespread. Foams are not well understood and they are very hard to control. A foam cannot be created without the vigorous introduction of gas from a bubbly mixture. Bubble baths and dishwater soap won't foam unless gas is stirred in by a water jet or another mixing mechanism. Foaming oils won't foam unless the drop in pressure is su ciently abrupt. To avoid a head of foam on beer it is necessary to pour the beer very slowly. To understand foaming it is necessary to try to be precise about the critical values of bubble release required to make and maintain a foam. All static foams are unstable, but some are more unstable than others. The stability of foams is another subject in which our understanding is far from complete. Foams collapse by draining and lm rupture. To keep a foa...|$|R
40|$|This {{editorial}} is an annotation on {{the exciting}} research topic ‘Microbiotechnology based surfactants and their applications’ that covers {{a compilation of}} original research articles, reviews and mini-reviews submitted by researchers enthusiastically {{working in the field}} of biosurfactants. Biosurfactants, which for a long time have been confused with bioemulsifiers, derived their name from biologically produced surfactants. The term ‘Surfactants’ was, however coined by Antara products in 1950 – which covered all products having surface activity, including wetting agents, emulsifiers, dispersants, <b>detergents</b> and <b>foaming</b> agents. The terms biosurfactants and bioemulsifiers have been used interchangeably for a long time until a demarcation has been suggested by several researchers including Uzoigwe et al., 2015. They emphasized that although biosurfactants and bioemulsifiers are both amphiphilic in nature and produced by variety of microbes, there are marked differences between them in terms of their physico-chemical properties and physiological roles. Authors strongly presented their opinion that bioemulsifiers are not biosurfactants as only biosurfactants have the surfactant effect of reducing surface tension, although both can emulsify solutions. Debating on the topic of emulsification, another study by Das et al., 2014 from China, showed that emulsification potential and also the antimicrobial activity of rhamnolipid biosurfactants produced by crude oil extracted Pseudomonas sp. IMP 67 is effected by the ratio of monorhamnolipid (MRL) and dirhamnolipid (DRL) congeners. The MRL and DRL congeners were analysed by thin layer chromatography and rhamnose quantification. Rhamnolipids from Pseudomonas sp. IMP 67 also reduced the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of some antibiotics signifying the synergistic role of these rhamnolipids with antibiotics. If there is one major stumbling block in the flourishing of the business of biosurfactants it is their high cost of production. There are many factors that can {{play a significant role in}} order to bring down the expenses and make the process cost-effective. One such factor is the usage of low-cost substrates for the production of biosurfactants. Second to this could be the exploration of new strains or strains and classes which has been less-explored for biosurfactant production. An extensive review by Kugler and co-authors precisely talks about the class Actinobacteria and suggest a lack of structural information on a large proportion of Actinobacterial surfactants. Authors claim that the sheer magnitude of Actinobacterial surfactants that still remains undetermined is evident from this comprehensive review (Kugler et al., 2015). A better understanding of the diversity of the Actinobacterial surfactants would allow to further explore their potential for various novel biotechnological applications just as in case of lipopeptide biosurfactants produced by many microorganisms including Bacillus species. Lipopeptides, a series of chemical structural analogues of many different families, are one of the five major classes of biosurfactants known. Among the different families identified, 26 families covering about 90 lipopeptide compounds have been reported in last two decades (Liu et al., 2015). Not only the less-researched strains and classes but a significant leap is required investigating the carbon sources that would work best for high biosurfactant production. Addressing this area are the original research articles by Antoniou et al., 2015, Gudina et al., 2015, and Ismail et al., 2014, and a review by Banat et al., 2014. Eleftheria Antoniou and co-researchers from Greece, investigated the biosurfactant production yield of marine hydrocarbon degraders isolated from Elefsina Bay (Eastern Mediterranean Sea) in presence of heavy oil fraction of crude oil as substrate. Their data particularly emphasized on Paracoccus marcusii to be an optimal choice for various bioremediation applications. They reported that the isolated pure strains were found to have higher specific production yields (50 ± 20 mg/l) than the complex microbial marine community-consortia (20 mg/l) (Antoniou et al., 2015). Crude oil was the best energy source for these marine hydrocarbon degraders whereas corn steep liquor (CSL) turned out to be an ideal substrate for Bacillus subtilis # 573 (Gudina et al., 2015).
