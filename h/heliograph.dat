5|$|The primary {{types of}} visual {{signalling}} were Semaphore flags, lamps and flags, lamps and lights, and the <b>heliograph.</b> In open warfare, visual signalling (employing signal flags and the <b>heliograph)</b> was the norm. A competent signaller could transmit 12 {{words a minute}} with signal flags (during daylight) and signal lights (at night). Signal lights, which were secured in a wooden case, employed a battery-operated Morse code key. These signalling techniques had certain disadvantages, however. In trench warfare, operators using these methods were forced to expose themselves to enemy fire; while messages sent to the rear by signal lights could not be seen by enemy forces, replies to such messages were readily spotted, and operators were, once again, exposed to enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|A {{squadron}} of the 8th Light Horse Regiment of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, commanded by Major Macpherson, left Nazareth at 05:00 on 25 September. They led the advance towards Tiberias {{along the main}} road, while troopers from the 10th Light Horse Regiment, also of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, were ordered {{to the top of}} Mount Tabor. From this height, they could observe Macpherson's squadron and report on its progress to their brigade commander by <b>heliograph.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades {{first made}} contact with the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade by <b>heliograph,</b> after which Royston, {{commanding}} the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, galloped across to explain the situation. Chaytor then moved the Auckland and Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiments, supported by the Somerset Battery, onto high ground between {{the right of the}} light horse and the Yeomanry, which was shortly afterwards joined by the remainder of the 5th Mounted Brigade under the command of Brigadier General Wiggin. At the most critical period of the day's fighting, when the German and Ottoman force of 2,000 dominated the Romani area from Mount Royston, the five mounted brigades (still less the 5th Light Horse Regiment) began their counterattack at 14:00 from the west towards Mount Royston.|$|E

25|$|The Signal Corps' {{role in the}} Spanish–American War of 1898 and the {{subsequent}} Philippine Insurrection was on a grander scale {{than it had been}} in the Civil War. In addition to visual signaling, including <b>heliograph,</b> the corps supplied telephone and telegraph wire lines and cable communications, fostered the use of telephones in combat, employed combat photography, and renewed the use of balloons. Shortly after the war, the Signal Corps constructed the Washington-Alaska Military Cable and Telegraph System (WAMCATS) also known as the Alaska Communications System (ACS), introducing the first wireless telegraph in the Western Hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|Three other {{survivors}} {{managed to}} board a small liferaft. One was the duty radio officer who had sent the distress message. The others were a badly wounded DEMS gunner, EG Elliot RN, and a passenger called Frank Brothers. After they had drifted for four days they sighted a submarine and used the reflective surface of a tobacco tin as a <b>heliograph</b> to attract her attention. The submarine, {{which may have been}} U-124, came and gave them fresh water. The next day the weather worsened, and in the afternoon the radio officer died.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the {{electrical}} telegraph, ancient civilizations, such as Greece, Egypt, and China, transmitted long-distance information using drumbeats, flame beacons, or light flashes with a <b>heliograph.</b> Later, nearly all information {{was limited to}} traveling {{at the speed of}} a human or animal. The telegraph freed communication from the time constraints of postage and revolutionized the global economy and society. By the end of the 19th century, the telegraph was becoming an increasingly common medium of communication for ordinary people. The telegraph isolated the message (information) from the physical movement of objects or the process.|$|E
500|$|Agreeing to {{meet with}} General Miles, Geronimo's band rode with Gatewood to Lawton's camp in Guadalupe Canyon, the {{entrance}} to the United States. [...] Lawton received Geronimo and agreed to allow the Apaches to retain their weapons for defense against nearby Mexican troops. [...] Lawton left for a <b>heliograph</b> station to send word to Miles, leaving Lieutenant Abiel Smith in command. [...] Smith and Wood wanted to disarm the Apaches because they were prisoners-of-war. Smith told Gatewood that he wanted a meeting with Geronimo's men, but Gatewood refused because he knew Smith wanted to murder Geronimo, rather than bring him to Miles. [...] Smith persisted and Gatewood threatened to [...] "blow the head off the first soldier in line", who was Leonard Wood. Wood left to write a dispatch and Gatewood turned to the next man, Smith, who finally relented.|$|E
500|$|Having re-established {{communication}} on {{the morning}} of 29 July, the British garrison signalled the approaching relief forces via <b>heliograph</b> at 8:00am – [...] "Heavy fighting all night. Expect more tonight. What ammunition are you bringing? When may we expect you?" [...] During the day, the Pashtuns prepared for another night attack while the British destroyed the bazaar and the regions previously defended, and lost, by Subadar Syed Ahmed Shah and the men of the 31st. Trees were also cut down to improve fields of fire, attracting further attention from the Pashtun sharpshooters. Major Stuart Beatsen arrived at 4:00pm on the 29th with the 11th Bengal Lancers who had been summoned from Nowshera two days previous. The 35th Sikhs and 38th Dogras arrived {{at the mouth of the}} pass leading to Malakand South, but after losing between 19 and 21 of their ranks through heat exhaustion, they were forced to halt.|$|E

500|$|The {{fourth stage}} {{involved}} remedying {{the problem of}} communicating between the two towers {{during the time of}} Pope Pius X. His plans were to make the Gregorian Tower into a historical tower and to record and carry out observations at the second tower by linking the two towers along the fortified wall with a [...] iron bridge spanning the gap. At the west end of this bridge, a four-inch equatorial was installed on semicircular bastion. The east end of the bridge, above the barracks of the gendarmes, had a <b>heliograph,</b> with a camera attached, used to photograph the Sun (photoheliograph). A new 16-inch visual telescope, called Torre Pio X, was erected in the second tower. As a result of these modifications, the original library was moved to the Pontifical Academy Lincei, and the old meteorological and seismic instruments were shifted to the Valle di Pompei observatory. The new Astronomical Library was housed in two rooms of the building. The two new Repsold machines were used for recording on the astrographic plates. The recorded observations were published along with explanatory notes together with the last two series of the atlas of stars. Charts were printed on silver bromide paper.|$|E
500|$|The {{conflict}} at Kimberley {{started on}} 14 October 1899. [...] Colonel Baden-Powell, anticipating the inevitable onset of hostilities, encouraged {{all the women}} and children to leave the town. [...] Some civilians left in a special train, escorted as far as Vryburg by an armoured train. [...] On the return journey, the armoured train was captured in the first action of the war between Kimberley and Mafeking at Kraaipan by Boers under the command of fighting general De la Rey, the hero of the western Transvaal. [...] On 12October, the Jacobsdal Commando severed the railway line at the bridge over the Modder River south of Kimberley, whereafter the Boers entrenched themselves in the hills at Spytfontein. [...] Meanwhile, the Boshof Commando severed the railway line [...] north of the town at Riverton Road, then shut off the primary water supply at Riverton on the Vaal River. [...] For the first time, water in the mines became more precious than the diamonds in them. On 14October the Boers cut the telephone line to the Cape. [...] <b>Heliograph</b> and dispatch riders consequently had to make hazardous journeys through Boer lines to the Orange River and then to Cape Town and Port Elizabeth. [...] On 15 October, martial law was declared in the town.|$|E
500|$|French's {{flanking}} manoeuvre took a {{very high}} toll on horses and men in the blazing summer heat, with about 500 horses either dying en route or no longer fit to ride. [...] When Cronjé became aware of French's cavalry on his left flank at Klip Drift, he concluded that the British were trying to draw him eastwards away from his prepared defences. [...] He despatched 900men with guns to stop the British push northwards. [...] French's men set out from Klip Drift at 9:30am on 15February on the last stage of their journey to Kimberley, and were soon engaged by the Boer force sent to block them. [...] Rifle fire came from the river in the east while artillery shells rained from the hills in the north west; the route the Kimberley lay straight ahead through the crossfire, so French ordered a bold cavalry charge down the middle. [...] As waves of horses galloped forward, the Boers poured down fire from the two sides. However, {{the speed of the}} attack, screened by a massive cloud of dust, proved successful and the Boer force was defeated. British casualties during this day's fighting were five dead and ten wounded, with approximately 70 horses lost through exhaustion. However, the route to Kimberley was open; by that evening, General French and his men passed through the recently abandoned Boer lines, and relieved the town of Kimberley after some initial difficulty in convincing the defenders via <b>heliograph</b> that they weren't Boers. [...] The cavalry had covered [...] in four days at the height of summer to reach the town. [...] When French arrived in town, he snubbed Kekewich, the local military authority, by presenting himself to Rhodes instead.|$|E
50|$|In Larry Niven's Ringworld series, the ghouls are a {{race that}} eats the dead of the other races that live on the ringworld.

50|$|Optical communications, {{in various}} forms, {{have been used}} for {{thousands}} of years. The Ancient Greeks used a coded alphabetic system of signalling with torches developed by Cleoxenus, Democleitus and Polybius. In the modern era, semaphores and wireless solar telegraphs called <b>heliographs</b> were developed, using coded signals to communicate with their recipients.|$|R
50|$|Visualization of {{the results}} of {{canonical}} correlation is usually through bar plots of the coefficients of the two sets of variables for the pairs of canonical variates showing significant correlation. Some authors suggest that they are best visualized by plotting them as <b>heliographs,</b> a circular format with ray like bars, with each half representing the two sets of variables.|$|R
2500|$|While on the Yellowstone, he {{developed}} expertise with the <b>heliograph</b> for sending communications signals, establishing a [...] line of heliographs connecting Fort Keogh and Fort Custer, Montana, in 1878.

2500|$|With Pawsey's help, £630,000 {{was raised}} from the Ford Foundation {{to build the}} Culgoora radio-heliograph. Years later he was to admit [...] "When I think back I wonder how I {{had the nerve to}} do it." [...] The <b>heliograph</b> stayed in {{operation}} for 17 years from 1967, providing a huge amount of data and insight into the way the solar corona works and the relationship between solar and terrestrial phenomena. Wild published more than 70 papers in this field. The <b>heliograph</b> also played a leading supporting role in both the Skylab missions of 1973–74 and the solar maximum mission of 1980–81, providing real-time observations of coronal activity. It was de-commissioned in 1984 {{to make way for the}} Australia Telescope and transferred to the Ionospheric Prediction Service, where it is still used today for space weather monitoring of solar activity. Now there are at least 20 ground-based radio-spectrographs operating around the world.|$|E
2500|$|One {{of their}} {{projects}} included {{the construction of}} a [...] steel framed lookout tower on <b>Heliograph</b> Peak to watch for fires in the Pinaleños and nearby mountain ranges including the Galiuros, Dos Cabezas, White Mountains, Gilas, Rincons and Santa Catalinas. The tower still stands as of 2006, however, most fire watching efforts in Arizona are conducted from the ground or by airplane.|$|E
5|$|Early {{means of}} {{communicating}} over a distance included visual signals, such as beacons, smoke signals, semaphore telegraphs, signal flags, and optical <b>heliographs.</b> Other examples of pre-modern long-distance communication included audio messages such as coded drumbeats, lung-blown horns, and loud whistles. 20th and 21st century technologies for long-distance communication usually involve electrical and electromagnetic technologies, such as telegraph, telephone, and teleprinter, networks, radio, microwave transmission, fiber optics, and communications satellites.|$|R
50|$|The {{simple and}} {{effective}} instrument that Mance invented {{was to be}} an important part of military communications for more than 60 years. The usefulness of <b>heliographs</b> was limited to daytimes with strong sunlight, but they were the most powerful type of visual signalling device known. In pre-radio times heliography was often the only means of communication that could span ranges of as much as 100 miles with a lightweight portable instrument.|$|R
