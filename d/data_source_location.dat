50|$|Nirvana {{operation}} {{is controlled by}} three daemons; Metadata, Sync and ILM. The Metadata Daemon can extract metadata automatically from an instrument creating data, from within the file's actual data using predefined and customizable templates and metadata parsing policies, or capturing user input via the GUI or Command Line Interface. The Sync Daemon, running in the background, detects when files are added to, or deleted from, the underlying Storage Resource filesystems. When filesystem changes are observed by the Sync Daemon, the changes are registered and updated in MCAT. The ILM Daemon routinely queries the MCAT and executes actions including migration, replication, or backup on a specified schedule. For example, an administrator can set a policy to free up space on an expensive primary storage system by migrating that data to distributed retention locations based on criteria such as: storage consumption watermarks (percent full), all data associated with a specific project, or data that hasn't been accessed in over one year. The policies are extremely flexible. User-defined metadata attributes (e.g. Project, Principal investigator, <b>Data</b> <b>source,</b> <b>Location,</b> Temperature, etc.) {{can also be used}} to move data. Nirvana ILM policy execution occurs behind the scenes, transparent to end-users or applications.|$|E

Although the computer science community has proposed several machine learning models designed to relate specific POI to mobility traces (this challenge {{is referred to as the}} ‘trajectory semantic problem’) and has applied these models to several business scenarios, even the state-of-the art models [48] are not sufficiently accurate for rigorous social and economic science research.

Objective To provide a review of existing algorithms for the detection or classification of adventitious respiratory sounds. This systematic review provides a complete summary of methods used in the literature to give a baseline for future works. Data sources A systematic review of English articles published between 1938 and 2016, searched using the Scopus (1938 - 2016) and IEEExplore (1984 - 2016) databases. Additional articles were further obtained by references listed in the articles found.

Array element localization (AEL) methods are typically based on inverting acoustic arrival-time measurements from controlled sources at (approxi mately) known positions to the receivers to be localized. This paper presents and illustrates a general approach to AEL inversion and to AEL survey design based on quantifying the posterior receiver-location uncertainty, taking into account uncertainties in the <b>data,</b> <b>source</b> <b>locations,</b> sound speed, and water depth. The inversion {{is based on a}} fast ray-tracing algorithm th a t employs Newton’s method and the method of images to determine eigenrays for direct and reflected arrivals. The efficiency of this approach allows computationally intensive analysis such as Monte-Carlo appraisal and nonlinear optimization for designing optimal source configurations. These algorithms provide a rigorous approach that can be applied to examine all aspects of AEL accuracy and survey design, illustrated here by several examples. It is shown th a t synchronized AEL surveys (in which source transmission times are known) provide only a minor improvement over non-synchronized surveys (often much simpler logistically), and the difference can be made up by using more sources in an optimal configuration or by including add...|$|R
40|$|The Arctic is an {{important}} region {{in the study of}} climate change, but monitoring surface temperatures in this region is challenging, particularly in areas covered by sea ice. Here in situ, satellite and reanalysis data were utilised to investigate whether global warming over recent decades could be better estimated by changing the way the Arctic is treated in calculating global mean temperature. The degree of difference arising from using five different techniques, based on existing temperature anomaly dataset techniques, to estimate Arctic SAT anomalies over land and sea ice were investigated using reanalysis data as a testbed. Techniques which interpolated anomalies were found to result in smaller errors than non-interpolating techniques. Kriging techniques provided the smallest errors in anomaly estimates. Similar accuracies were found for anomalies estimated from in situ meteorological station SAT records using a kriging technique. Whether additional <b>data</b> <b>sources,</b> which are not currently utilised in temperature anomaly datasets, would improve estimates of Arctic surface air temperature anomalies was investigated within the reanalysis testbed and using in situ data. For the reanalysis study, the additional input anomalies were reanalysis data sampled at certain supplementary <b>data</b> <b>source</b> <b>locations</b> over Arctic land and sea ice areas. For the in situ data study, the additional input anomalies over sea ice were surface temperature anomalies derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer satellite instruments. The use of additional <b>data</b> <b>sources,</b> particularly those located in the Arctic Ocean over sea ice or on islands in sparsely observed regions, can lead to substantial improvements in the accuracy of estimated anomalies. Decreases in Root Mean Square Error can be up to 0. 2 K for Arctic-average anomalies and more than 1 K for spatially resolved anomalies.

40|$|Increasing {{interest}} in monitoring the spatial {{variation of temperature}} at the animal level in swine finishing barns {{has led to the}} development of a new wireless data acquisition system. Previous studies used individual commercial data loggers placed in a protective container, then lowered into the animal pens. These traditional systems required significant effort to download each logger individually and to post-process the data into a time-synchronized file with all measurement points. The newly developed wireless system allows all measurement points to be simultaneously collected and logged to a single external data file. The specific project objectives include (1) develop a wireless sensor node capable of meeting the data transfer and sensor interface requirements of a swine finishing barn and (2) evaluate the performance of the wireless node through experimental testing. Each wireless node is preset with a specific ID which is logged with the sensor data to provide a definite indicator for the <b>data’s</b> <b>source</b> <b>location</b> within the barn. The individual nodes use a high accuracy thermistor for temperature sensing and are capable of transmitting one additional analog signal and eight digital signals to the data logger. The digital inputs were commonly used to collect fan activity data for ventilation monitoring. The additional analog channel can be used for other environmental sensing or for monitoring static pressure. When powered from a single 3. 6 volt, 1200 mAhr battery, the wireless nodes have a usable life of 3. 5 years when transmitting at a 5 -minute sampling interval.

More specifically, the robot's performance is characterized in terms of its ability to sense the target locations from a distance, to maneuver quickly, and to perform computations for inference and planning. We also characterize the performance of the robot in terms of the amount and distribution of information that can be acquired at each <b>data</b> <b>source.</b> The following are among our theoretical results: the distribution of the amount of information among the target locations immensely impacts the requirements for sensing targets from a distance; performance increases with increasing maneuvering capability, but with diminishing returns; and the computation requirements increase more rapidly for planning as opposed to inference, with both increasing sensing range and maneuvering ability. We provide computational experiments to validate our theoretical results. Finally, we demonstrate that these results can be utilized in the co-design of sensing, actuation, and computation capabilities of mobile robotic systems for an information-gathering mission. Our proof techniques establish novel connections between the fundamental problems of robotic information-gathering and the last-passage percolation problem of statistical mechanics, which may be of interest on its own right.

The first few minutes of ground motions on local and regional distance waveforms are inverted for point-source centroid moment tensors. Waveforms recorded at regional distances (300 - 1500 km) can be adequately modeled at periods longer than 50 s using the laterally homogeneous PREM model [Dziewonski and Anderson, 1981]; at closer distances (< 300 km) waves with periods as short as 35 s can be analyzed using PREM. Best double-couple focal mechanisms for 18 recent large western U. S. earthquakes compare very well with those obtained by other methods. Our procedure, interfaced with automated <b>data</b> retrieval and <b>source</b> <b>location</b> methods, is a viable tool for reliable deter-mination of seismic moment and fault mechanism within 30 minutes after an earthquake...|$|R
40|$|A {{research}} about the Cellular Robotic System (CRS) behaviour in polluted environments and {{a comparison of}} its performances with respect to single robots is proposed in this paper. Each robotic unit {{is equipped with a}} sensory system with three pairs of ultrasonic sensors, two chemical sensors to detect gas sources and a communication system based on an infrared transmitter and receiver. Useful information has been given by the study of cooperative behaviours. A software simulator coded in C language, based on an earlier version accomplished at LIRA [...] Lab, allows to study cooperation strategies {{in the presence of a}} gradient caused by a gas leak. A simple, but realistic enough, method to simulate a gas expansion and a function that realizes the gas sensor simulation have been introduced. Sensorial <b>data</b> management, gas <b>source</b> <b>location</b> strategies and many techniques to reach a cooperative behaviour are illustrated. Different simulation steps have been obtained varying both working environm [...] ...|$|R
