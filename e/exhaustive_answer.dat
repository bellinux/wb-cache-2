6000|$|It was {{certainly}} true that Miss Stackpole, during her visit to Paris, which had been professionally more remunerative than her English sojourn, had not {{been living in the}} world of dreams. Mr. Bantling, who had now returned to England, was her companion for the first four weeks of her stay; and about Mr. Bantling there was nothing dreamy. Isabel learned from her friend that the two had led a life of great personal intimacy and that this had been a peculiar advantage to Henrietta, owing to the gentleman's remarkable knowledge of Paris. He had explained everything, shown her everything, been her constant guide and interpreter. They had breakfasted together, dined together, gone to the theatre together, supped together, really in a manner quite lived together. He was a true friend, Henrietta more than once assured our heroine; and she had never supposed that she could like any Englishman so well. Isabel could not have told you why, but she found something that ministered to mirth in the alliance the correspondent of the Interviewer had struck with Lady Pensil's brother; her amusement moreover subsisted in face {{of the fact that she}} thought it a credit to each of them. Isabel couldn't rid herself of a suspicion that they were playing somehow at cross-purposes--that the simplicity of each had been entrapped. But this simplicity was on either side none the less honourable. It was as graceful on Henrietta's part to believe that Mr. Bantling took an interest in the diffusion of lively journalism and in consolidating the position of lady-correspondents as it was on the part of his companion to suppose that the cause of the Interviewer--a periodical of which he never formed a very definite conception--was, if subtly analysed (a task to which Mr. Bantling felt himself quite equal), but the cause of Miss Stackpole's need of demonstrative affection. Each of these groping celibates supplied at any rate a want of which the other was impatiently conscious. Mr. Bantling, who was of rather a slow and a discursive habit, relished a prompt, keen, positive woman, who charmed him by the influence of a shining, challenging eye and a kind of bandbox freshness, and who kindled a perception of raciness in a mind to which the usual fare of life seemed unsalted. Henrietta, on the other hand, enjoyed the society of a gentleman who appeared somehow, in his way, made, by expensive, roundabout, almost [...] "quaint" [...] processes, for her use, and whose leisured state, though generally indefensible, was a decided boon to a breathless mate, and who was furnished with an easy, traditional, though by no means <b>exhaustive,</b> <b>answer</b> to almost any social or practical question that could come up. She often found Mr. Bantling's answers very convenient, and in the press of catching the American post would largely and showily address them to publicity. It was to be feared that she was indeed drifting toward those abysses of sophistication as to which Isabel, wishing for a good-humoured retort, had warned her. There might be danger in store for Isabel; but it was scarcely to be hoped that Miss Stackpole, on her side, would find permanent rest in any adoption of the views of a class pledged to all the old abuses. Isabel continued to warn her good-humouredly; Lady Pensil's obliging brother was sometimes, on our heroine's lips, an object of irreverent and facetious allusion. Nothing, however, could exceed Henrietta's amiability on this point; she used to abound in the sense of Isabel's irony and to enumerate with elation the hours she had spent with this perfect man of the world--a term that had ceased to make with her, as previously, for opprobrium. Then, a few moments later, she would forget that they had been talking jocosely and would mention with impulsive earnestness some expedition she had enjoyed in his company. She would say: [...] "Oh, I know all about Versailles; I went there with Mr. Bantling. I was bound to see it thoroughly--I warned him when we went out there that I was thorough: so we spent three days at the hotel and wandered all over the place. It was lovely weather--a kind of Indian summer, only not so good. We just lived in that park. Oh yes; you can't tell me anything about Versailles." [...] Henrietta appeared to have made arrangements to meet her gallant friend during the spring in Italy.|$|E

As far as the issue of such areas development is concerned, the importance of the so- called "soft" socio-cultural development factors (including social and human capital) has been accentuated. The way-out is the belief that with the limited development potential of the peripheral (and rural) areas, activity and activism of local communities (quality of social and human capital) as the important internal (endogenous) development factor become more important.

30|$|This article {{draws on}} {{a strand of}} {{literature}} that investigates the political dynamics of technology by examining the patterns of power and authority it facilitates, and by being attentive to the range of social practices and governance structures that emerge around it [17, 18]. Rather than demarcating science and technology as separate from societal structures, the article attempts to understand how ZEP’s visions and strategies for CCS assume particular paths of co-production [19], where technological development and social life develop dialectically. In this spirit ZEP’s descriptions and depictions of CCS are treated here as expressions of sociotechnical imaginaries [20], founded not only on technical predictions but also on assumptions about social change and stability. This approach responds to recent calls in FS scholarship for heightened awareness of the political pathways and institutional factors that enable or constrain the efforts to realize futures that are envisioned as desirable [21], supplementing it by also addressing the constellations of power that such visions assume. The article is explorative, and adopts an STS-approach to “opening up” assumptions and implicit framings that underlie expert predictions and recommendations about the future [22].

In particular, when the network {{will serve as a}} digital communication infrastructure, each user is identified by a node of the network, and contributes to the build-up process by strategically balancing between her building cost (i. e., the number of links she personally activates in the network) and her usage cost (i. e., some function of the distance in the sought network to the other players). When the corresponding game is analyzed, the generally adopted assumption is that players have a common and complete information about the evolving network topology, which is quite unrealistic though, due to the massive size this may have in practice. In this paper, we thus relax this assumption, by instead letting the players have only a partial knowledge of the network. To this respect, we make use of three popular traceroute-based knowledge models used in network discovering (i. e., the activity of reconstructing the topology of an unknown network through queries at its nodes), namely: (i) distance vector, (ii) shortest-path tree view, and (iii) layered view.

In the case of rectangular representations R=[r^s] we found an evidence that the corresponding differential expansion miraculously factorizes and can be obtained from that for the twist knots.

Yet, thanks to the archaeological discoveries at Tura, one can discern some semblance of the relationship between these two men. Didymus aided Athanasius’ ecclesial, political, and theological agenda by championing a particular strain of pro-Nicene Christian theology in fourth-century Alexandria.

This is significant, particularly given the challenges posed to democracy within the EU institutions and the Member States. Notwithstanding its peculiarities (a symmetrical bicameral system in which both Houses are directly elected, hold the same powers and are linked through a confidence relationship with the government), the Italian Parliament deserves specific attention as a lively active player of the European polity.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies counterfactual conditionals in English. Counterfactual conditionals typically {{come with}} inferences that their antecedent and their consequent {{are not true}} in the actual world (written CF-p and CF-q, respectively). (1) If John had taken the bus, {{he would have been}} on time. 	CF-p: John did not take the bus 	CF-q: John was not on timeFocusing on CF-q, the dissertation answers the question of what contextual conditions must be met for CF-q to arise, by looking at cases in which the inference gets cancelled. I show that CF-q can be cancelled {{in a number of different}} contexts:- in some but not all conditionals that have the words 'also' or 'still' in their consequent;- in a set of conditionals when uttered with a specific intonation contour. Empirically, I show that when 'also' focus-associates with material in the antecedent, it cancels CF-q, but when it associates with material in the consequent it does not. This difference in focus association is reflected in the prosodic properties of the particle 'also' in the conditional. The first step of the analysis is to find a property that unites the different CF-q-cancellation contexts. I argue that what they have in common is their making salient more than one cause for the same consequent (a multiple cause context). In the case of 'also', association with focus determines where focus alternatives are generated, which in turn determines whether a single or multiple causes are made salient. The second step of the analysis is to show that conditional perfection (strengthening conditionals to biconditionals) is a necessary ingredient for the CF-q inference to arise, an idea sketched by Karttunen (1971). The crucial prediction is that in contexts in which no conditional perfection occurs, CF-q is not generated either. Finally, I show that multiple cause contexts do not trigger conditional perfection, which in view of the above-mentioned prediction completes the analysis. Moreover, because conditional perfection has been analyzed in terms of discourse structure and <b>exhaustive</b> <b>answers,</b> we obtain a new set of theoretical tools to study counterfactuality as a discourse phenomenon...|$|R

Headmasters usually have visions for school improvement, but also have a large and complex mission, and are {{constantly}} in a cross pressure between different demands from various stakeholders. In the educational leadership there is a large free space, and diverse school improvement currents to relate to. Headmasters work with school improvement in different ways. The purpose of the study: The overall aim of the study is to explore the headmasters’ perceptions of the educational leadership, within school development. The specific purpose of the study is to find out the headmasters’ perceptions of the school development assignment, how they perform the school improvement work in practice, and what opportunities and obstacles they experience. Furthermore, I intend to explore what school improvement currents have influenced the headmasters’ in their work, and what the control documents’ requirements on a scientific basis mean to the respondents. Method: This study is based on a phenomenographically, qualitative method. To get as <b>exhaustive</b> <b>answers</b> as possible I have done semi-structured interviews, based on main issues. The sample consists of six headmasters from two different municipalities. The informants are between 41 and 58 years old. All of them have a background as a teacher. Result: The results show that the headmasters emphasize the importance of being challenging and confirmatory, and also responsive, present and involved leaders. According to the informants, the school development assignment is comprehensive, {{but at the same time}} it gives the headmasters a chance to effect on the school results. However, time and the complexity of headmasters’ mission are seen as obstacles for school development. Some of the respondents, but not all of them, find a distinct link between the systematic quality work and the daily school development work. The headmasters don’t believe that they have been influenced by different school improvement currents, but you can still see traces of the different alignments in their work.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the intonational {{properties}} {{of a type}} of focus construction that has been understudied, represented by answers to wh-questions in which the constituent that fills the variable does not do so exhaustively, that is, it does not provide an <b>exhaustive</b> <b>answer</b> because the speaker cannot commit to asserting that the other potential alternative candidates to fill the variable are cancelled. This type of narrow focus, Non-Exhaustive Narrow Focus (NENF), is different from Exhaustive Narrow Focus (ENF), in which a constituent fills the variable of the question exhaustively, with a concomitant cancellation {{of the rest of}} the focal alternatives. Our claim is that natural languages have the means to distinguish ENF and NENF unambiguously through prosodic means. In the present study, we show that speakers of (Northern Bizkaian) Basque assign particular intonational features to answers to wh-questions that should be interpreted non-exhaustively. In our experiment, we measured peak scaling of accents in the subject and the verb in ENF and NENF utterances. The results show that NENF is distinguished from ENF in having a pitch accent on the verb with a higher F 0 value, almost as if the verb were focalized. In fact, we compared the intonational patterns of NENF with Verum Focus constructions, in which the polarity of the event expressed by the verb is focalized, and there were no significant differences in the verbal peaks in NENF and VF. There were no significant differences in peak scaling in the subject’s stressed syllable between ENF and NENF, and neither were there any differences between NENF and VF. The paper offers a semantic analysis of the differences between ENF and NENF, by claiming that NENF is a split focus construction, in which both the subject and the polarity (or rather, the pairing between the subject and the polarity) constitute the focus of the utterance...|$|E

A family practitioner can {{play a crucial role in}} the preoperative assessment as he/she knows the patient best. Foremost, he/she can also decide which examinations should the patient undergo before admission to the hospital for the elective surgery. At the hospital, consultants of different specialities are asked to cooperate with the anaesthesiologist according to the nature of the patient disease. The ward doctors are informed about the patient’s special needs after the surgery. The anaesthesiologists play a crucial role in taking care of badly injured and critically ill patients. As the head of the trauma team, the anaesthesiologist has to cooperate with the doctors of different specialities, such as general practitioners, who are in charge of the prehospital care, then with surgeonstraumatologists and other specialists according to the pathology of the patient. Results. Cooperation of doctors of different specialities is valuable in the preoperative assessment of the patient, though it is sometimes time consuming. The lost time can be fatal for the patient. Conclusions. A more personal approach in communication with consultants is needed. Merely writing notes is just not enough. A consultant would so get a clearer picture of the patient and the anaesthesiologist a quicker and <b>exhaustive</b> <b>answer</b> to the questions. A proper and efficient communication is needed between the prehospital doctor and the anaesthesiologist. Hospitals should provide better technical conditions for adequate communication. </p...|$|E
40|$|The paper aims at giving {{suggestions}} for a deterministic approach to earthquake warning based on combined ground and space observations of earthquake precursors and related theoretical modeling. On {{the occasion of}} a destructive earthquake often a strong debate arises between administrators, engineers, specialists in applied geophysics and seismology, technicians of local and civil services, and authorities that need to take adequate measures for assistance and protection {{of the population and}} reconstruction of houses and infrastructures. But on the same occasion also a question about a possible prediction of the event and prevention damage arises in the people and scientists, which of course, can not receive any <b>exhaustive</b> <b>answer.</b> Under the emotional stress of people involved in the disaster, often there are also misleading overlapping proposals and procedures, misdirections and not constructive solutions. A possible contribution to earthquake warning and prediction may be given by observations and physical modeling of earthquake precursors aim at seeing in perspective the phenomenon earthquake within the framework of a unified theory able to explain the causes of its genesis, and the dynamics, rheology, and microphysics of its preparation, occurrence, post-seismic relaxation, and inter-seismic phases. Unfortunately, up to now what is lacking is the demonstration of a causal relationship (with explained physical processes and looking for a correlation) between data gathered simultaneously and continuously by space observations and ground-based measurements. In doing this, modern and/or new methods and technologies have to be adopted to try to solve the problem. Coordinated space and ground-based observations imply available test sites on the Earth surface to correlate ground data, collected by appropriate networks of instruments, with space ones detected on board of Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellites. Moreover, a new strong theoretical scientific effort is necessary to try to understand the physics of earthquake(s). Within this framework a few projects and experiments have been carried out on the subject by our team and accompanied by specific theoretical interpretations. They are reported in the paper. As an introduction and justification to these studies the paper also clarifies some basic concepts, critical and methodological aspects concerning deterministic and statistic approaches, and their use in earthquake prediction and warning.

40|$|Ontologies {{have been}} {{designed}} to capture the semantic knowledge of a domain in a machine understandable form. Current standards for managing ontologies like OWL are lacking in linguistic grounding, and are not able to achieve a clear link with natural language. Bridging this gap, unskilled users could be able to infer the information described in the ontology and it would be possible either producing or parsing utterances about the represented domain automatically. Moreover, {{as in the case of}} enterprises, it could be very useful to extract information from external documental corpora that are related to the same domain. Many attempts have been made with the aim to create a natural language interface to ontology but very few of them use grammars during interaction; such interfaces are focused only on verbalizing information contained in the ontology, while it is often necessary to give <b>exhaustive</b> <b>answers</b> to the users’s queries by retrieving data outside of the knowledge base. The work presented in this thesis has been inspired by theories in the field of Cognitive Linguistics, and in particular by the Construction Grammar, to create a grammar-based tool for ontology verbalization that combines OWL ontologies with Fluid Construction Grammar (FCG). Currently, FCG is the only computational implementation of Construction Grammar that performs both production, and parsing using the same set of constructions. The main idea is to compute both lexical and grammatical constructions (the meaning-form couples) in the FCG from the ontology. To achieve this goal, a suitable set of rules based on linguistic typology have been defined to infer semantics and syntax from the RDF triples inside the OWL structure, while combining them as the poles of constructions in the FCG. To allow verbalization from external documents related to the ontology, synonymous constructions have been defined, which are matched to free text. Computing all possible syntactic forms for the same meaning was achieved using linguistic rules. The information retrieval procedure outlined above allows semantic annotation of the text as a side effect. A system for automatic generation of contents for Semantic MediaWiki from standard Wikipedia pages has been implemented in this respect. The combination of OWL with FCG and the integration of external documents in the ontology are the core of the system whose theoretical background, modeling, design, and evaluation with respect to other contributes in this research field form the main subjects of this thesis...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a dynamic account of topic and focus. A dynamic view on meanings as context change potentials (e. g. Stalnaker, Kamp, Heim, Groenendijk & Stokhof) will {{provide us with}} a substantial account of the dependence of focused answers on the context set up by their preceding questions. Questions pose conditions on the focal structure of their answers (Paul 1880) and can further restrict the domain of subsequent focusing operators like only (e. g. von Stechow 1990; von Fintel 1995; Jäger 1996). As an illustration of these two facts consider the following example: (1) a. Who did John introduce to Sue? b. Which gentlemen did John introduce to Sue? c. John only introduced [Bill]F to Sue. d. # John only introduced Bill to [Sue]F. After question (1 a) or (1 b), only an answer with the focal structure in (1 c) is felicitous or congruent. The focal structure in (1 d) is out. Consider now the meaning of the congruent answer (1 c). After question (1 a), (1 c) means ‘The only person John introduced to Sue is Bill’. After (1 b), it can mean ‘The only gentleman John introduced to Sue is Bill’. Standard analyses of focus define congruence in terms of identity between the question meaning and the focal alternatives of the answer (e. g. von Stechow 1990; Roberts 1996), and identify the domain of focusing operators like only with the set of focal alternatives (e. g. Rooth 1985). In our example, the two distinct questions (1 a) and (1 b) pose the same conditions on the focal structures of their answers but can have different effects on the quantificational domain of subsequent only. These two facts constitute a problem for these standard theories unless they come equipped with a smart analysis of the dynamics of domain restriction which plays a role in these cases. The main goal {{of this article is to}} provide such an analysis. Most existing dynamic analyses of questions have been developed in the tradition of the partition theory of Groenendijk and Stokhof 1984. In the partition theory, the meaning of a question is identified with the set of meanings of all its <b>exhaustive</b> <b>answers.</b> In a dynamic setting, questions partition information 1 states, and answers eliminate blocks of these partitioned contexts (see Groenendij...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} an {{approach}} to the <b>exhaustive</b> interpretation of <b>answers</b> is developed. It builds on a proposal brought forward by Groenendijk & Stokhof (1984). We will use the close connection between their approach and McCarthy’s (1980, 1986) predicate circumscription to describe exhaustive interpretation as an instance of interpretation in minimal models, well-known from work on counterfactuals (see for instance Lewis (1973)). It is shown that by combining this approach with independent developments in semantics/pragmatics one can overcome certain limitations of Groenenedijk & Stokhof’s (1984) proposal. In {{the last part of}} the paper we will provide a Gricean motivation for exhaustive interpretation building on work of van Rooij & Schulz (2004) ...|$|R
