5|$|With this tour, I'm {{going to}} be working on some {{different}} arrangements for some of the older songs, to... give <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> life to them. That's not to say they're going to sound totally different and to freak anybody out... I love re-singing songs to different music. I genuinely want to tour with these new songs, as well as older hits. These new songs mean so much to me, this time of my life has been so wonderful for me, and I want to experience that with my fans.|$|E
500|$|Cohn and Levithan {{had written}} the novel in {{alternating}} chapters: Cohn writing from Norah's perspective and Levithan writing from Nick's perspective. Cera and Dennings recorded voice-over narration to mimic the first-person perspective from which the novel is written, but the voice-overs {{were not included in}} the final cut of the film. Scafaria says that the differences between the novel and the film were [...] "to make <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> cinematic". She said that Nick and Norah's parents were written out of the script [...] "to absorb what it's like to be young, [...] you're not thinking about your parents when you're out all night". In addition to searching for Where's Fluffy?, Sollett felt that the film needed a second MacGuffin to propel the story forwards, so Norah's best friend Caroline got drunk and then lost, giving Nick and Norah an additional objective.|$|E
500|$|Holley auditioned {{to become}} a {{featured}} vocalist on the American reality television show Dancing with the Stars. The audition consisted of him performing seven different sounds, ranging from Frank Sinatra to Sly Stone. He was successful and became a featured singer {{during the first three}} seasons of the series. Holley later noted that the concept of diversity in vocal performance was not a new experience for him. [...] "I've been at sessions where a producer has said he wants me to sound like Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen at the same time. I've had people say can you make <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> green. Huh? It's tricky." [...] He added, [...] "Sometimes they think they want Sheryl Crow, because she has a hit single. But what they really want is magic, and that is whatever you, as an individual, can bring. It's a tough call between being a blank slate and being yourself." ...|$|E
5000|$|Well, <b>it's</b> real. <b>It's</b> <b>a</b> {{recording}} of a performance, {{of a real}} performance between a group of people, an entourage, a band, {{as opposed to a}} facsimile of that, which is frequently what people do with multi-track recording ... I prefer <b>it.</b> <b>It's</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> real. <b>It's</b> got <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> heart.|$|R
6000|$|He smiled ruefully. [...] "I {{begin to}} have new doubts about this ranger business. <b>It's</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> {{vigorous}} than I thought <b>it</b> was. Suppose <b>a</b> fellow breaks a leg {{on one of those}} high trails?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... “I kinda went at it {{with the}} {{approach}} that I am <b>a</b> <b>little</b> hungrier, and took a more personal approach,” Winkler told Alternative Addiction in a 2010 interview. “We went <b>a</b> <b>little</b> darker and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> heavier with this record, <b>it’s</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> real.”.|$|R
500|$|It {{was always}} the same sort of system with us. We would write the nucleus of the song, the melody primary music, and then some of the words were there as we {{finished}} writing it. I started playing some rock 'n' roll piano and started boogie woogie-ing my left hand, and that inspired Mariah {{to come up with the}} melodic [...] 'I don't want a lot for Christmas.' And then we started singing and playing around with this rock 'n' roll boogie song, which immediately came out to be the nucleus of what would end up being 'All I Want For Christmas Is You.' That one went very quickly: It was an easier song to write than some of the other ones. It was very formulaic, not a lot of chord changes. I tried to make <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> unique, putting in some special chords that you really don't hear a lot of, which made it unique and special.|$|E
500|$|The actress {{noted that}} Jo matures during her hiatus between {{the second and}} fifth season. Having found {{out the hard way}} that [...] "banter doesn't always work", she becomes quieter and [...] "not as mouthy". The {{character}} [...] "called the shots" [...] in her final appearance, and was the [...] "bigger person" [...] by forcing everyone to accept the reality of the situation. After years of hunting together, the relationship between Jo and Ellen also develops; Tal came to view them more as equals rather than daughter and mother. Although Jo's feelings for Dean remain the same, Tal liked the fact that she does not easily give in to Dean's advances in [...] "Abandon All Hope...". She believed that Jo resists her urge to [...] "go crazy [...] " [...] due to the dire circumstances, which [...] "gave <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> meaning". When asked about the kiss that Dean gives to Jo when she is dying, Tal explained that she interpreted the kiss as Dean [...] "really seeing [...] and thanking [...] and appreciating [...] For him, at that particular moment, {{there was no other way}} to express it but with a kiss." ...|$|E
500|$|Barker's drum {{track was}} labeled by Drummerworld as [...] "one {{of the most}} {{creative}} beats of his career," [...] and mainly consists of the same basic beat repeated in sections throughout the verses. The first measure begins with the kick drum and splash cymbal playing on the downbeat, followed by a hit on the bell of the ride cymbal on beat two, preceding an open hi-hat that rings out for a full count on beat three. [...] "The kick, snare, and floor tom are all hit simultaneously on beat four, followed by floor tom hits on the last two sixteenth-note triplets of beat four." [...] The snare is hit on beats two and four, respectively. The song [...] "gradually builds to a powerful, piano-laden crescendo," [...] and the song's final chorus and conclusion take a more uplifting view of the world: [...] "Tomorrow holds such better days / Days when I can still feel alive/ When I can't wait to get outside." [...] DeLonge noted that over six guitar parts were recorded for the [...] "gigantic, sad" [...] choruses, but upon mixing, only four were used. [...] "The extra ones didn't really do anything besides make <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> unclear what was going on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It seems," [...] said Ormsgill, [...] "Dom Erminio has his men in hand. <b>It's</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than I {{expected}} from him. Presumably our friend wishes {{to keep him}} occupied while he seizes the canoes. Anyway, his boys will be considerably more dangerous when they've wasted their ammunition." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the original film, the remake's starring cast is mostly black. Actor Michael Ealy said the story could be read independently of race and {{that it did not}} mean the original film would be called [...] "predominantly white". Actor Kevin Hart said, [...] "I feel that what we're doing is making <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit <b>more</b> modern, by incorporating black people. I don't think it's just about us being black, <b>it's</b> just <b>a</b> different take on the relationship feel. Our rants are <b>a</b> <b>little</b> different than <b>a</b> white rant. Our way of arguing is different from a Caucasian couple's fights. <b>It's</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> violent. <b>It</b> gets <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> vulgar. Things are said that you don't expect to be said." [...] The Toronto Sun reported that in addition to the all-black cast, the remake would be closer in tone to the source material.|$|R

500|$|The lyrical {{content of}} Fever chiefly focuses on themes {{of love and}} enjoyment. Thompson {{described}} the album to be [...] "all about dancing, fucking, {{and having a good}} time". In the song [...] "Love at First Sight", Minogue describes how {{she fell in love with}} her partner at [...] "first sight" [...] and how it led to good things happening for her. [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] was termed a [...] "mystery" [...] as the singer never mentions who her object of desire in the song is. Lynskey Dorian from The Guardian suggested that Minogue refers to either [...] "a partner, an evasive one-night stand or someone who doesn't know she exists" [...] as her obsession. The production of [...] "Give It to Me" [...] contrasts with its lyrics: Minogue urges her partner to [...] "slow down," [...] but the beat [...] "goes in the opposite direction and tells your body to push <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> on the dance floor." [...] The lyrics of [...] "Fragile" [...] are simple and aim directly at the [...] " [...] heart". [...] "Come into My World" [...] is a [...] "plea for love" [...] as Minogue invites her partner into her life. On the other hand, [...] "Dancefloor" [...] focuses on issues like dealing with an end of a relationship, with Minogue celebrating a break-up by [...] "lose it in the music".|$|E
2500|$|The {{most notable}} {{of these was}} Neofytos Vamvas, head of the School of Philosophy, and later Dean, of the University of Athens. [...] (Despite his high reputation, he had been {{considered}} too 'radical' for the School of Theology.) [...] Vamvas had been a close friend and follower of Korais in Paris, {{and over the years}} 1831–50 he led a small team of scholars in producing a translation of the Old and New Testaments into the 'Pan-Hellenic' katharevousa of the time — certainly not the spoken language, but close enough to it, it was hoped, to influence everyday speech and make <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> like Ancient Greek.|$|E
60|$|So, after all, {{the day had}} {{not been}} quite without mortification, and Felix felt <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than {{he thought it was}} worth.|$|E
5000|$|Jon Condit of Dread Central rated it 3/5 {{stars and}} wrote {{that it is}} {{modestly}} entertaining. [...] David Johnson of DVD Verdict wrote, [...] "It's an adequate horror flick that maybe thinks <b>it's</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> awesome than <b>it</b> actually is, but {{the sum total of}} the copious bloodletting and fun, old-school creature effects equals 'not a waste of time.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Access Hollywood, Phillips explained more {{about the meaning of}} the song:“"Yeah, <b>it's</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> rock, but uh you know, <b>it's</b> just <b>a</b> song wanting to feel those butterflies, you know you love and you know the first time you kissed that person, in the music video, you know I had this kind of idea {{to be a part of}} a painting.” ...|$|R
60|$|She forgot <b>it</b> even <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more.</b> “Oh if you’re in {{love with}} her too!” she quite wailed, turning away.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you said}} that there was a terrible sequel," [...] {{suggested}} Cecily smilingly: [...] "tell us THAT. Perhaps Mr. Bracy may receive <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> politely." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Somers, pouring {{a cup of}} tea: [...] "That makes <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> difficult. I {{can keep}} from {{offering}} Mrs. Wharton some tea, but I can't stop its snowing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must allow}} me to make <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than that," [...] the patient answered. [...] "Your {{treatment}} was worth it. I feel perfectly recovered already. Good night, sir!" ...|$|E
5000|$|The album {{version of}} the song was the one where you don't even know the singer," [...] 50 told DJ Whoo Kid over the weekend on Sirius XM Radio. [...] "I did the {{reference}} in the studio. <b>It's</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> visual. Ne-Yo lightened <b>it</b> up <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit and made it ready for radio. It works. I gotta sift through and see what I'm gonna put on the album. The Ne-Yo record is a stronger radio version.|$|R
60|$|I saw {{the door}} move, {{and the snow}} drift in. I saw <b>it</b> move <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more,</b> and <b>a</b> hand softly interpose to keep it open.|$|R
6000|$|... "They know," [...] said Madame. [...] "They {{know each}} other's places. <b>It</b> is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than <b>a</b> year since {{we came to}} Knarborough. But they will remember." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} can hold them, Roger. Take <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> easily now. We are all right as far as speed goes. It is simply a {{question}} of bottom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are beloved in {{the village}} and out of it," [...] said Harry, with a knowing emphasis, [...] "and I have flattered you, as you call <b>it,</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> still, farther on." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{eight o'clock}} we put ashore for breakfast--which {{was just a}} {{repetition}} of the supper of the preceding night, with this exception, that we discussed <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> hurriedly--and then proceeded on our way.|$|E
5000|$|Cardle {{wrote the}} song in Los Angeles and it was {{recorded}} at Canvas Studios in London and Studio 217 in Los Angeles. Cardle says the song is about [...] "not {{being able to make}} up my mind whether I want to sleep around or not!" [...] and [...] "To be with that one person that really means something to you." [...] He says it the poppiest track on the album and describes it as [...] "hooky, <b>it's</b> funky, <b>it's</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> colourful".|$|R
6000|$|... "I think <b>it</b> tells <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> {{than the}} truth, mamma. <b>As</b> you say, <b>it</b> is <b>a</b> well-written letter. He always writes well {{when he is}} in earnest. But yet--" ...|$|R
6000|$|The old {{man looked}} puzzled. [...] "Yes; but <b>it</b> seems <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> special than that. Someway {{your face is}} {{associated}} with trouble in my mind. Did we have any disagreement?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But quite seriously," [...] she added, [...] "give <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> thought--the enlisting, I mean. The world isn't {{too rich}} in kind influences. It needs men like you. Come, pull {{yourself}} together and {{show a little}} pluck." [...] She laughed.|$|E
6000|$|I turned, on <b>it,</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> to him, {{and looked}} at him so long that he had at last to look at me; with which, after holding his eyes another moment, I made my point. [...] "Our hands are not clean." ...|$|E
60|$|So Hapley {{turned to}} chess, and found <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> soothing. He soon {{mastered}} the moves {{and the chief}} gambits and commoner closing positions, and began to beat the Vicar. But then the cylindrical contours of the opposite king began to resemble Pawkins standing up and gasping ineffectually against Check-mate, and Hapley decided to give up chess.|$|E
2500|$|In a December 2007 interview, Sebastian Bach claimed Rose {{had planned}} to have the album {{released}} by Christmas 2007: [...] "I know Axl was very serious about putting something out before Christmas. He was {{talking to me about}} it. He was talking about finishing liner notes." [...] Bach also said that Chinese Democracys delay might be because of business problems: [...] "I think there's a lot of business shit that goes on with him. It's just not as easy. <b>It's</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> complicated than people think." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{deserved}} it all," [...] said Aurelia; [...] "and I do hope that I am <b>a</b> <b>little</b> wiser and less foolish for <b>it</b> all; <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> of <b>a</b> woman," [...] she added, blushing.|$|R
5000|$|AllMusic disliked Kowalczyk's lyrics, {{claiming}} they were [...] "Either too literal or bewilderingly obtuse" [...] {{and said that}} the album was, [...] "Still recognizably Live...big, big guitars, sweeping anthemic choruses, earnest ballads, mildly histrionic vocals...but <b>it's</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> subdued and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> serious and quite streamlined...The biggest problem with the record is that the eye is on the big picture...to the extent that the individual moments aren't all that memorable, clearly lacking singles as forceful as those that fueled Throwing Copper." [...] AllMusic concluded by claiming that, [...] "Live is growing up and settling down, turning into a solid thirty-something rock band." ...|$|R
