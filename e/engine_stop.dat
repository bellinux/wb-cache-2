40|$|The cathode-less {{electron}} {{cyclotron resonance}} ion engines, µ 10, have propelled the Hayabusa asteroid explorer for seven years since the launch in May 2003. The spacecraft was focused on demonstrating the technology needed for a sample return from an asteroid, using electric propulsion, optical navigation, material sampling in a zero gravity field, and direct re-entry from a heliocentric orbit. Final stage of the return cruise and subsequent trajectory correction maneuvers have accomplished by using a specially combined operation of neutralizer A and ion source B after exhaust of other neutralizers ' lives by autumn of 2009. Total duration of powered spaceflight was 25590 hours which provided a delta-V of 2. 2 km/s and a total impulse of 1 MN·s, approximately. Degradation trend of the thruster performances has been investigated. It seems {{that the cause of}} the degradation is mainly due to decrease of effective microwave power input to the discharge plasma induced by increase of transmission loss of microwave feed system and is not due to increase of gas leakage through accelerator grid apertures enlarged by erosion. Unintentional <b>engine</b> <b>stop</b> events have been summarized and analyzed. Most of them were due to limit check errors of backward microwave powers. Such errors will be decreased by careful monitoring of the trend change of microwave backward power as a function of xenon flow rate in future missions...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation {{is to find a}} solution to the critical problems such as the increase in friction and wear that may occur to the stand-by diesel engine for phase I units at Dr. Sharief Power Station due to engine rundown with low pressurized lubricating oil caused by the non operation of the pre-priming pump and low speed of engine mechanical oil pump. The study suggests a solution to these problems by allowing the cutting-in of pre-priming pump during engine rundown. Although the manufacturer assured the operation of the pre-priming pump during engine rundown, but it was verified that this pump failed to operate automatically or manually during the engine rundown when it was tested periodically. The relevant data for the pre-priming pump has been collected from the operating and maintenance instruction manuals for the stand-by diesel engine for phase I units at Dr. Sharief Power Station. The collected data on the existing pre-priming pump was analyzed in conformity with the manufacturer's recommendations and it was found that this pump was not following the normal operating procedure for heavy duty and high speed diesel engines. The study found that the solution for this problem is to modify the electrical stop circuit of the engine to provide the ability of automatic operation of the prepriming pump during the engine rundown. SIEMENS PLC software has been used to draw, modify and simulate the <b>engine</b> <b>stop</b> circuit and was applied properl...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 This thesis {{presents}} {{the design process}} used to create and validate a hybrid vehicle supervisory control system for a {{plug-in hybrid electric vehicle}} in the EcoCAR 2 competition. The vehicle utilized a Parallel through the Road hybrid architecture with a B 20 biodiesel engine-powered front axle and electric motor-driven rear axle. The primary goal of this work is to present a selection of the processes used by the controls team throughout the competition to define the control system requirements and platforms, model the components of the vehicle and validate each model, and estimate the effects of various control system strategies and parameters on overall vehicle performance. The advantages of using a version-controlled Simulink model for supervisory controller development are discussed along with an explanation of the software architecture and primary hybrid control modes. The models developed to simulate the primary drivetrain components are detailed in addition to their parameterization and validation testing methods. The final chapter presents an analysis on dynamometer test data used to quantify the effects of various controller parameters and strategies on the results of the Emissions and Energy Consumption (E&EC) event's dynamic drive testing. The electrical energy consumption of the vehicle during charge depleting mode testing is used to select a state of charge value for transitioning to charge sustaining mode. Various implementations of <b>engine</b> <b>stop</b> start are also analyzed, showing the potential for a 3. 8 % improvement in B 20 fuel consumption {{over the course of the}} City/Highway E&EC drive cycle...|$|E
40|$|An engine {{tilting test}} stand {{is still in}} the design process at VTP Roztoky. During this design process, a model has been {{suggested}} that starts with the engine, and ends with a dynamometer. Throughout this thesis, first an analytical, and then a dynamic model has been built in the necessary software to examine and evaluate mass properties of rotating parts of a flexible power transmission between a combustion engine and a dynamometer. The natural resonant frequencies of the system have been assessed, and the behavior of the system during the resonant frequencies have been evaluated. Using the dynamic model, the dynamic torques between the relevant parts have been examined, and in some cases converted to other variables to monitor the safety, and possibly failure, of the relevant parts in question. Transient behavior for engine start and <b>engine</b> <b>stop</b> has also been assessed, and monitored for possible critical conditions, and finally, design suggestions have been made to get the system to create alternative options for the parts in question, and possible make the system more efficient and safe.

The analytical model and the dynamic model show the same natural frequencies, which justifies that the system model was properly built in the software GT-Suite. The dynamic variables have been evaluated and it has been found out that both the dual mass flywheel and the hydro motor are safe to use, as long as the resonant frequencies are passed {{in a short period of}} time without letting the resonant peak torques build up. The critical dynamic torque value for the dual mass flywheel 480 Nm, and the critical pressure value for the hydro elements 360 bars are both not exceeded. In both cases the simulation results show that the values do not even exceed 200. The frequency analysis shows that the critical areas are between 0 - 100 RPM and 800 - 900 RPM, where the resonant frequencies cross with the engine RPM and create high torque and rotational speed amplitudes. Finally, the future steps regarding the project are discussed, where a suggestion has been made to improve the analytical model by adding extra masses and torsional stiffness, while it is stated that its possible and needed to build a full engine model in 1 -D to be able to properly evaluate the transient engine starting and stopping conditions...|$|E
