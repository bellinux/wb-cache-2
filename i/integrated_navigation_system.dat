Today, {{it takes}} a lot of {{knowledge}} to be able to handle these advanced functions that can be found within the ECDIS, conning and radar systems. It is of great use to be able to know what will happen to the specific systems when a system or sensor in the chain around it fails or delivers bad data. The study will be based on the following questions: What is the view by Swedish officers around the user-friendliness of radar, ECDIS and conning systems? What are Swedish officers’ views on the importance of having drills related to <b>integrated</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems?</b> How do Swedish officer’s see their own knowledge and understanding around the topic <b>integrated</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> to be able to monitor and operate these systems with familiarity? The study is supported by a survey where the participants were able to express their experience regarding <b>integrated</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems.</b> Also, the researchers were able to examine how the officers see their own understanding in regards to <b>integrated</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems.</b> After that three semi-structured interviews were conducted. First, with a manufacturer of <b>integrated</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> and then followed by two senior Swedish officers. The interviews were a follow-up on the survey results but also it provided an opportunity to more qualitative data on user-friendliness, drills and the general knowledge by officers. The result shows that education regarding <b>integrated</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> has been deficient. System failures do occur frequently but no clear structure on how to handle the situations that follow has been made.

Compared with the well known extended Kalman filter (EKF), a recurrent neural network is proposed for the solution, which not only improves the location precision, the adaptive ability of resisting disturbances, but also avoids calculating the analytic derivation and Jacobian matrices of the nonlinear system model. In order to test the performances of the recurrent neural network, these two methods are used to estimate {{states of the}} vehicle DR <b>navigation</b> <b>system.</b> Simulation results show the recurrent neural network is superior to the EKF and is a more ideal filtering method for vehicle DR navigation.

40|$|In 1817, F. Bohnenberger {{presented}} an apparatus {{consisting of a}} fast spinning rotor with cardanic suspension. His invention {{formed the basis for}} L. Foucault’s epochal studies on gyroscopic sensors {{in the middle of the}} 19 th century. The development of instruments like the artificial horizon and the directional gyro is a direct result of this work. Later on, gyro technology led also to stabilized platforms forming the early variants of inertial <b>navigation</b> <b>systems.</b> Foucault’s initial intention of using Bohnenberger’s invention as a sensor was the provision of a device offering an inertial direction reference for surveying and navigation. Due to technical limitations, a gyro is, however, suitable for such a task during only a limited period of time. To enable a long-term usage, additional, complementary measurements are required. An artificial horizon therefore includes levelling sensors, and a directional gyro is typically coupled with a magnetic compass. On the other hand, the main feature of <b>integrated</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> is the fusion of data from dis-similar signal sources. Thus, artificial horizons and directional gyros represent elementary forms of such <b>systems.</b> Modern <b>integrated</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> of high performance consist of the combination of inertial strapdown systems (being the successor of stabilized platforms) and GPS receivers. In photogrammetry, they have become an essential tool for direct georeferencing. Nevertheless, their system structure is still traceable to the early gyro instruments mentioned.
