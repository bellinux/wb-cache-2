25|$|Traditional Faroese food {{is mainly}} based on meat, seafood and {{potatoes}} and uses few fresh vegetables. Mutton of the Faroe sheep {{is the basis}} of many meals, {{and one of the most}} popular treats is skerpikjøt, well aged, wind-dried mutton, which is quite chewy. The <b>drying</b> <b>shed,</b> known as a hjallur, is a standard feature in many Faroese homes, particularly in the small towns and villages. Other traditional foods are ræst kjøt (semi-dried mutton) and ræstur fiskur, matured fish. Another Faroese specialty is tvøst og spik, pilot whale meat and blubber. (A parallel meat/fat dish made with offal is garnatálg.) Meat and blubber from a pilot whale means food for a long time. Fresh fish also features strongly in the traditional local diet, as do seabirds, such as Faroese puffins, and their eggs. Dried fish is also commonly eaten.|$|E

50|$|The Driving Creek Railway (DCR) {{was slowly}} {{expanded}} {{over the next}} 25 years {{to become one of}} the very few completely new railway lines in New Zealand in recent years. The project required significant civil engineering works due to the steep and complex terrain that the line traverses. Among these are the famous Double-Deck viaduct, three tunnels, ten bridges (including the Double-Deck Viaduct) and inclines as steep as 1 in 14. There is also a short branchline from the potteries to a firewood <b>drying</b> <b>shed,</b> including a short bridge, bridge NO 1A, just behind the workshops at Driving Creek; this line is not used by passenger trains, although passengers will see the <b>drying</b> <b>shed</b> climbing up from NO 1 bridge towards the Lower Spiral.
