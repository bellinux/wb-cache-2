40|$|The {{starting}} point for risk management and hedging lies in understanding a corporation’s exposure to different risks. Hedging is vital for corporate risk management, involving reducing the exposure of the company to particular risks. Hedge effectiveness testing permits firms to assess if they match {{the timing of the}} gains and losses of <b>hedged</b> <b>items</b> and their hedging derivatives. In principle, a hedge is highly effective if the changes in fair value or cash flow of the hedged item and the hedging derivative offset each other to a significant extent. This article reviews the concepts of accounting and economic hedging, and presents the requirements for testing the hedge effectiveness. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{evaluate}} the pricing performance of market advisory services’ live cattle hedging recommendations over 1995 - 2004. Also, feeder cattle, corn, and soybean meal recommendations were evaluated as input hedges and combined with the live cattle marketing recommendations to approximate the margin that a typical feedlot would face from {{the third quarter of}} 1999 through 2004. Other marketing assumptions were also applied to approximate a real world feedlot in Western Kansas. Several key assumptions are i) the feedlot markets on average 1 ctw of live cattle per quarter, inputs are purchased at rates that will yield on average 1 ctw of live cattle per quarter, or 4 ctw total per year, ii) the marketing widow for live cattle marketings begins six months {{prior to the start of}} the marketing quarter, making the total marketing window nine months long, iii) brokerage costs are subtracted from futures and options markets gains or losses and iv) the purchases of inputs, live cattle marketed per quarter and benchmarks are weighted by quarter to reflect the cyclical nature of live cattle marketing. The net price an advisory service receives for a given quarter is compared to a market benchmark to evaluate the performance of the service. The market benchmarks used in this study are weighted average cash prices per quarter for each of the <b>hedged</b> <b>items.</b> Each market benchmark is calculated to assume the same assumptions and cash marketing schedule applied to each advisory service’s track record. Four performance measures are used to evaluate the pricing performance of the advisory services over 1995 - 2004 for live cattle and 1999 Q 3 - 2004 for margin recommendations. Results show that advisory services as a group do not outperform the benchmark in either live cattle or margin recommendations. Also, no advisory services produced prices that were statistically iii different from the benchmark when averaged over all quarters. When risk was taken into account, advisory services again did not outperform the benchmark as a group; however, two advisory services yielded pricing performance superior to the benchmarks in live cattle and one in margin hedging. Overall, the results show that advisory services do not appear to “beat the market. ” While there were few services that produced results superior to the benchmark, the services as a group did not provide feedlots the opportunity to improve their margin levels relative to the market and a strategy of marketing a portion of your live cattle per month and achieving the market benchmark was the most profitable strategy...|$|E

50|$|To be {{designated}} and qualify for FAS 133 hedge accounting, a commodity (<b>hedged</b> <b>item)</b> and its <b>hedging</b> instrument {{must have a}} correlation ratio between 80% and 125%, and the reporting enterprise must have hedge documentation {{in place at the}} inception of the hedge. If these criteria are not met, hedge accounting cannot be applied. The non-applicability of hedge accounting can lead to significant volatility in corporate earnings. Now, the financial community has had enough experience with FAS 133 that companies and constituents better understand this process and are less critical of the volatile impact on earnings.|$|R
40|$|The European Commission’s recent {{decision}} 1 {{to require the}} use of international accounting standards (IAS 2) for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of listed companies is motivated by the very understandable and justifiable desire to improve the comparability of financial statements and achieve a level playing field. However, it raises a number of issues of principle, and some major practical difficulties. Looking beyond technical implementation issues, central bankers are faced with two crucial questions in terms of the maintenance of financial stability. – Are the standards sufficiently prudent in today’s climate of economic uncertainty and mistrust of the markets, and will they address the shortcomings that have recently been revealed? – Is there not a risk of the standards introducing artificial volatility into financial statements, impairing a proper understanding of the true position of economic agents? This article looks at the main changes proposed by the IASB in the light of these two questions, and in particular at changes which have a very significant impact on financial intermediaries, which oil the wheels of every economy. The changes in accounting for credit risk by credit institutions introduced by the revised IAS 39 3 are undoubtedly an advance in conceptual terms: by requiring the earlier recognition of risk in the accounts, they should reduce the cyclical nature (and hence the volatility) of the financial reporting of credit risk. They are also an advance in terms of regulatory convergence, in that they are closer to the prudential rules included in the new solvency ratio. As regards the determination of corporate risk exposures and the criteria for derecognition – an issue at the heart of recent accounting scandals – the IASB proposes a middle way between two contrasting approaches. On the one hand there is the view that favours form over the economic substance of risks; this has led some standard-setters to allow derecognitions that look excessive given the actual risk exposure. Other standard-setters define the concept of risk in very broad terms, prohibiting any transfer of assets and liabilities off balance sheet or any use of derecognition where the “transferor” retains the risks or rewards (i. e. profits) of a transferred asset. These two extreme positions lead to very different definitions of what should be in a balance sheet. The approach recommended by the IASB is a compromise. Although it undoubtedly needs to be made more effective, it does offer an interesting perspective. However, the concept of fair value, a key element in the IASB framework, and the proposed arrangements regarding risk management and hedging by banks, pose serious problems in terms of financial stability. Fair value accounting involves valuing as many balance and off balance sheet items as possible at market value, or where there is no market value, at a valuation calculated using modelling techniques. This appears to run counter to the principle of prudence, and to create artificial volatility in earnings and equity. Valuing all except held-to-maturity securities at market value, irrespective of liquidity or negotiability or of the intention of the owner, contravenes the principle of prudence in that some of the potential capital gains thus calculated may prove to be wholly illusory. Moreover, this approach will inevitably lead to unjustifiably high volatility in earnings and equity, which might actually aggravate the current confusion in the markets. The IASB proposals on risk hedging have similar negative effects to those on fair value accounting. The IASB requires mark-to-market valuation for all hedging instruments. The logical implication of this approach – if the principle of symmetrical treatment is to be preserved – is that the same valuation method should be used for <b>hedged</b> <b>items</b> as well. This proposal risks extending fair value accounting to intermediation banking (where the hedged item is generally accounted for), with all the attendant consequences in terms of prudence and volatility. Two other IASB proposals could also have significant consequences for the financial statements of companies in general, and not just those of banks: firstly the proposals on business combinations and the treatment of goodwill, and secondly the rules on employee benefits (pension liabilities and stock options). The effect of these two types of proposal on financial stability is not clear. If, as the IASB suggests, a purchase accounting approach is used for business combinations and goodwill is no longer amortised but subject to regular impairment reviews, this would seem to promote greater transparency and in future might even prevent some of the abuses surrounding corporate acquisitions. Similarly, the systematic recognition in the income statement of pension liabilities and of stock option grants would make corporate policies in these areas more transparent. However, a “big bang” application of these new standards would probably put many companies into a difficult position, which in turn might impair financial stability. ...|$|E

40|$|I {{examine the}} {{information}} content of unrealized {{cash flow hedge}} gains/losses for future profitability and stock returns. An unrealized gain on a cash flow hedge suggests {{that the price of}} the underlying <b>hedged</b> <b>item</b> (i. e. commodity price, foreign currency exchange rate or interest rate) moved in a direction that negatively affects the firm. Based on this inverse relation, I find that unrealized cash flow hedge gains/losses are negatively associated with future gross margin. This association is weaker for firms that have the ability to pass input price changes through to customers. Finally, I find that investors do not immediately price the information conveyed by cash flow hedges. Instead, investors appear surprised by future realizations of gross margin, consistent with the view that a lack of transparent disclosure on future hedged transactions leads to a delay in pricing. These results may inform current policy decisions of both the FASB and SEC...|$|R
40|$|Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 133 {{requires}} business entities {{to document}} their anticipation of hedge effectiveness {{in order to}} qualify for hedge accounting treatment of gains and losses from financial derivatives. Meaningful assessment of anticipated hedge effectiveness must consider two distinct aspects of a firm’s hedging strategy: (i) the strength of the hedging relation, which depends on the correlation between price changes in the <b>hedged</b> <b>item</b> and the <b>hedging</b> instru-ment under consideration; and (ii) the position taken in the hedging instrument relative to the optimal position. We propose an operational definition of hedge effectiveness that addresses both aspects of the hedging strategies under con-sideration. We then develop alternative measures of hedge effectiveness that take into consideration both the strength of the hedging relation and the hedge actually employed. This approach enables the user to evaluate the relative mer-its of alternative hedging strategies and thereby support risk management decisions, and to document the anticipation that a selected hedging strategy will be effective for compli-ance with FAS 133...|$|R
40|$|Abstract US GAAP {{as well as}} IAS (IFRS) contain {{specific}} accounting {{regulations for}} hedging activities. Basically the hedge accounting rules ensure that an offsetting gain or loss from a hedging instrument affects earnings {{in the same period}} as the gain or loss from the <b>hedged</b> <b>item.</b> However, due to the way hedge accounting rules are set up, their application turns out to be an option rather than an obligation for firms. Recognizing this fact, the paper analyses corporate incentives for hedge accounting {{in the presence of a}} moral hazard problem. We consider a two-period LEN-type agency model with a risk averse agent and a risk neutral principal. The principal decides upon hedging and motivates effort through an incentive contract based on accounting income. We find that in such a setting the principal strictly prefers hedging as opposed to no hedging. Whether he prefers hedge accounting or not depends on how the firm's overall risk exposure is allocated over periods. If risk exposures differ largely over periods the principal prefers hedge accounting. Otherwise no hedge accounting is preferred. ...|$|R
40|$|Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 133 {{requires}} business entities {{to document}} their anticipation of hedge effectiveness {{in order to}} qualify for hedge accounting treatment of gains and losses from financial derivatives. In the absence of specific guidelines, the accounting industry has espoused the " 80 - 125 " rule for determining hedge effectiveness. But the authors observe that meaningful assessment of anticipated hedge effectiveness must consider two distinct aspects of a firm's hedging strategy: (1) the strength of the hedging relationship, which is determined by the choice of the hedging instrument; and (2) the position taken in the hedging instrument relative to the holdings of the <b>hedged</b> <b>item.</b> They take both aspects of hedging into consideration in developing alternative measures of hedge effectiveness and distinguishing between the "potential" and "attained" effectiveness of a particular hedge. This approach enables the user to evaluate the relative merits of alternative hedging strategies to support risk management decisions, and also to document a selected hedging strategy's anticipated effectiveness for purposes of compliance with FAS 133. While the authors endorse a fairly broad interpretation of hedge effectiveness, their approach can also be used in the narrower context of an " 80 - 125 " rule. 2003 Morgan Stanley. ...|$|R
5000|$|The US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles {{also include}} {{instruction}} on accounting for derivatives. For the most part, {{the rules are}} similar to those given under IFRS. The standards that include these guidelines are SFAS 133 and 138. SFAS 133, written in 1998, stated that a “recognized asset or liability that may give rise to a foreign currency transaction gain or loss under Statement 52 (such as a foreign-currency-denominated receivable or payable) not be the <b>hedged</b> <b>item</b> in a foreign currency fair value or cash flow hedge”. [...] Based on the language used in the statement, this was done because the FASB felt that the assets and liabilities listed on a company’s books should reflect their historic cost value, rather than being adjusted for fair value. The use of a hedge would cause them to be revalued as such. Remember that the value of the hedge is derived from the value of the underlying asset. The amount recorded at payment or reception would differ from the value of the derivative recorded under SFAS 133.As illustrated above in the example, this difference between the hedge value and the asset or liability value can be effectively accounted for by using either a cash flow or a fair value hedge. Thus, two years later FASB issued SFAS 138 which amended SFAS 133 and allowed both cash flow and fair value hedges for foreign exchanges. Citing the reasons given previously, SFAS 138 required the recording of derivative assets at fair value based on the prevailing spot rate.|$|R
40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2010. Includes bibliographical references. This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} empirical analysis of Korean hedges in contemporary spoken discourse. The data analyzed {{was drawn from}} my corpus based on approximately 17 hours of unplanned, naturally occurring conversations. This study classified lexical and syntactic hedges in my corpus and investigated the frequency of individual <b>hedge</b> <b>items.</b> It provided {{an analysis of the}} correlation between hedge use and sociopragmatic factors as well as pragmalinguistic factors. The results of statistical analysis reveal that (i) more hedges are used in two-party conversations than in multiple-party (three or four participants) conversations in Korean spoken discourse, (ii) more hedges are used in conversations with personal topics than with impersonal topics in Korean spoken discourse, and (iii) hedges in Korean spoken discourse are employed as a positive politeness strategy as well as a negative politeness strategy although hedges have been viewed traditionally as a form of negative politeness. There are several theoretical contributions. First, this study shows that previous sociolinguistic views on the correlation between hedge use and a social structural factor such as gender have reflected a tendency for overgeneralization. Second, the analysis of this study proposes the importance of social situational factors such as the number of speakers and the topic of conversation for sociopragmatic analysis. The most influential factors which affect hedge use in Korean spoken discourse are not social structural factors such as gender, age, region, or occupation, but social situational factors. Third, this study elucidates the function of hedges as interactive strategies which may facilitate the success of interactions between interlocutors, enhance interpersonal rapport, and establish solidarity in terms of a positive politeness strategy extending beyond the negative politeness strategy. Fourth, this study demonstrates that an analysis that include both sociopragmatic and pragmalinguistic perspectives is necessary and important when analyzing hedges. According to the empirical analysis of Korean hedges in this study, Korean hedge use is affected by contextual factors as well as strategic factors. Thus, multi-layered approach is meaningful for analyzing and comprehending the complexity of the hedge...|$|R
40|$|IAS 39 {{is going}} to {{significantly}} increase the workload of a corporate treasury. At the very least, all derivatives {{will need to be}} valued regularly and other assets may need to be valued or monitored depending on their classification. Other instruments, such as embedded derivatives and projected transactions that may not have traditionally been within the scope of the corporate treasurer or the treasury system, will also have to be evaluated. Essentially, treasury personnel are going to need far more flexibility in recording and tracking potential and actual exposures than they have in the past. Taking changes in the fair value of derivatives directly to the profit and loss account is highly likely to increase earnings volatility. This is illogical when you consider that these derivatives are hedges that exist primarily to reduce the volatility of actual economic earnings! This {{is one of the reasons}} hedge accounting has been permitted. If a hedge can be assigned to one or more exposures, then the changes in the value of the hedge can be offset against the change in the value of the <b>hedged</b> <b>item</b> and only the residual or ineffective portion will go to profit and loss. However, if a company decides to apply hedge accounting, this may create a whole new burden for the corporate treasury. Initially, testing will have to be done to demonstrate that the hedge is expected to be highly effective. A hedging relationship will also need to be formally designated and documented. The documentation will need to detail the objective and strategy of the hedge, the nature of the hedged risk and the testing method used to demonstrate effectiveness. Testing will have to be done prospectively and retrospectively throughout the life of a hedging relationship. For most corporates, using a system to do the grunt work will naturally be the preferred approach. The first requirement of an IAS 39 compliance system should be to reduce this workload, specifically by automating the tasks o...|$|R
40|$|This article {{uses the}} work of Cook and Semino on {{discourse}} deviation to investigate the schemata – the existing cognitive frameworks – that readers bring to their encounters with texts. It aims to challenge the tendency within some strands of discourse analysis and literary theory to ignore empirical readers and {{to focus on the}} effects of texts on readers while neglecting the role played by readerly agency. The analysis centres on a discussion between Liverpool residents with various levels of involvement in Small Island Read 2007 : a project encouraging residents of the city to read Andrea Levy’s novel Small Island as part of the commemoration of the 200 th anniversary of the passing of the Slave Trade Abolition Bill. In this discussion, <b>hedging</b> around lexical <b>items</b> connected to ethnicity and slavery suggests that these readers came to Small Island with a marked reluctance to discuss these topics. When coupled with corroborating data from online questionnaire responses on the topic of ethnicity, this finding is a significant one for understanding the effect of Small Island on its readers, as it offers a degree of contextualization missing from extant claims that readers have been transformed in some way by the novel, and brings empirical depth to discussions which have so far been predominantly theoretical. As an exploratory study, the analysis also offers a model for other investigations into the effects of reading which, I argue, would be enhanced by considering what readers bring to – as well as take from – their textual encounters...|$|R
