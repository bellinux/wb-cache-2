50|$|In {{audio and}} {{broadcast}} engineering, Audio over Ethernet (sometimes AoE—not {{to be confused}} with ATA over Ethernet) is the use of an Ethernet-based network to distribute real-time digital audio. AoE replaces bulky snake cables or audio-specific installed <b>low-voltage</b> <b>wiring</b> with standard network structured cabling in a facility. AoE provides a reliable backbone for any audio application, such as for large-scale sound reinforcement in stadiums, airports and convention centers, multiple studios or stages.|$|R
50|$|C-Bus {{is used in}} {{the control}} of domotics, or home {{automation}} systems, as well as commercial building lighting control systems.Unlike the more common X10 protocol which uses a signal imposed upon the AC power line, C-Bus uses a <b>dedicated</b> <b>low-voltage</b> cable or two-way wireless network to carry command and control signals. This improves the reliability of command transmission and makes C-Bus far more suitable for large, commercial applications than X10.|$|R

50|$|The {{building}} housed fire {{destroyed the}} main distribution frame, which was significant because the building contained twelve exchanges and five toll switching machines. The events {{relating to the}} fire make it notable {{for a number of}} reasons, including the extent of the disruption, the large scale and speed of the telephone system's recovery efforts (completed in just 23 days), and its starting or speeding the adoption of fire safety rules covering the installation of <b>low-voltage</b> <b>wiring</b> inside buildings, especially in areas that can spread fire or toxic fumes.|$|R
5000|$|For {{electrical}} zone valves, {{the motor}} {{is often a}} small shaded-pole synchronous motor combined with a rotary switch that can disconnect the motor at {{either of the two}} stopping points ("valve open" [...] or [...] "valve closed"). In this way, applying power to the [...] "open valve" [...] terminal causes the motor to run until the valve is open while applying power at the [...] "close valve" [...] terminal causes the motor to run until the valve is closed. The motor is commonly powered from the same 24 volt ac power source that is used {{for the rest of the}} control system. This allows the zone valves to be directly controlled by <b>low-voltage</b> thermostats and <b>wired</b> with <b>low-voltage</b> <b>wiring.</b> This style of valves requires the use of an SPDT thermostat or relay.|$|R
5000|$|In one design, {{the motor}} {{is often a}} small {{shaded-pole}} synchronous motor combined with a rotary switch that can disconnect the motor at {{either of the two}} stopping points ("damper open" [...] or [...] "damper closed"). In this way, applying power to the [...] "open damper" [...] terminal causes the motor to run until the damper is open while applying power at the [...] "close damper" [...] terminal causes the motor to run until the damper is closed. The motor is commonly powered from the same 24 volt AC power source that is used {{for the rest of the}} control system. This allows the zone dampers to be directly controlled by <b>low-voltage</b> thermostats and <b>wired</b> with <b>low-voltage</b> <b>wiring.</b> Because simultaneous closure of all dampers might harm the furnace or air handler, this style of damper is often designed to only obstruct a portion of the air duct, for example, 75%.|$|R
5000|$|Today, the IBEW conducts {{apprenticeship}} {{programs for}} electricians, linemen, and VDV (voice, data, and video) installers (who install <b>low-voltage</b> <b>wiring</b> such as computer networks), {{in conjunction with}} the National Electrical Contractors Association, {{under the auspices of the}} National Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee (NJATC), which allows apprentices to [...] "earn while you learn." [...] In Canadian jurisdictions, the IBEW does not deliver apprenticeship training, but does conduct supplemental training for government trained apprentices and journeypersons, often at little or no cost to its members. The IBEW local 353 Toronto requires all apprentices to be registered with the JAC (Joint Apprenticeship Council) for a number of safety courses, pre-apprenticeship training, pre-trade school courses, supplementary training, and pre-exam courses.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} a {{low-voltage}} and low-power Delta Sigma analog-to-digital (A/D) converter is presented. A third-order single-loop Delta Sigma modulator topology is implemented with the differential modified switched op-amp technique. The modulator topology has been transformed as to accommodate half-delay integrators. <b>Dedicated</b> <b>low-voltage</b> circuit building blocks, such as a class AB operational transconductance amplifier, a common-mode feedback amplifier, and a comparator are treated, as well as low-voltage design techniques. The influence of very low supply voltage on power consumption is discussed. Measurement results of the 900 -mV Delta Sigma A/D converter show a 77 -dB dynamic range in a 16 -kHz bandwidth and a 62 -dB peak signal-to-noise ratio for a 40 -mu W power consumption. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|High-voltage {{electrical}} equipment (generally regarded as being over 50 volts) is {{not permitted to}} be exposed in the plenum space above a drop ceiling. High voltage wiring must be enclosed in conduit or raceways, and must be physically isolated from <b>low-voltage</b> <b>wiring.</b> High voltage electrical devices similarly must be enclosed in a plenum space, inside a metallic container. Similarly, electrical outlets for domestic powered devices are not permitted inside the plenum space, though outlets can be installed on ceiling tiles inside electrical boxes, with the sockets exposed on the exterior bottom face of the drop ceiling. The purpose of these restrictions is to limit flame spread inside the unseen plenum space, {{in the event of}} high voltage equipment or wiring failure. Low voltage cabling is permitted because current flow is typically negligible so the risk of overheating and fire is limited.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the classic and system wiring {{as well as their}} {{implementation}} and visualization environment for its operation. The aim of this work is to implement the project of the existing high-voltage and <b>low-voltage</b> <b>wiring</b> housing units accompanied by a design of the system wiring. This design is then fully implemented. In the beginning of the work is introduction to system wiring as such, added by a brief comparison of current systems. Followed by two chapters dealing with two selected systems for the realization of wiring. These chapters succinctly capture the essence of the system, its characteristics and features offered by each system. The last part deals with project design of wiring for the residential unit and the procedure for its commissioning. The practical part is dedicated to creating drawings with the existing power and low voltage distribution systems, the design of the smart wiring and electrical switchboard, together with possible modifications. The project documentation also discusses technical report. Finally, the selected system is tested and commissioned according to the requirements...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{outlines}} themain {{electromagnetic compatibility}} issues frequently encountered in high-power grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems, and proposes several guidelines that allow {{to obtain an}} effective and highly efficient layout of the plant. At first, with reference to a 1 -MWp PV plant of Sorgenia Solar, Italy, the paper focuses on the peculiar aspects concerning the radio-frequency behavior of a large-size PV plant: the great extent of the direct-current cabling, the capacitance toward earth of the PV source, the common-mode (CM) disturbance generated by inverters, the galvanic isolation ensured by <b>dedicated</b> <b>low-voltage</b> power transformers, {{and the presence of}} resonant circuits for CM leakage currents. The dominant electromagnetic phenomena and coupling mechanisms are pointed out by means of an equivalent circuit and through measurements. In the light of the matured experience, several guidelines are proposed and a new reliable layout is implemented on a second 1 -MWp PV plant. New measurements confirm the validity of the proposed design strategy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we {{simulated}} series arc on electric heaters, {{vacuum cleaners}} and incandescent lamps {{controlled by a}} dimmer to analyze the characteristics of series arc that causes electric fires. A high pass filter (HPF) was designed to detect arc signal only. The HPF consists of 2 -stage coupling capacitors and detection impedance, and its low cut-off frequency of- 3 dB was estimated to 3 kHz. By using the HPF, we could detect high frequency components included in AC voltage and discriminate series arc signals on most types of loads used in <b>low-voltage</b> indoor <b>wiring</b> systems...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{intercom}} systems communicated over {{a set of}} <b>low-voltage</b> signal <b>wires</b> {{installed in}} {{the walls of a}} building. The installation was typically done during the building’s construction, but buildings could be retrofitted with communication wires, at a cost. Non-radio [...] "wireless" [...] intercom designs were developed that used a building's existing electrical wiring to carry communication signals. Such systems work similarly to normal wired intercom designs, with intercom stations using wires to connect to electrical outlets in rooms. This method of intercom connection is most useful in offices and homes served by a single electrical service. Products are available from a variety of manufacturers including Westinghouse and GE.|$|R
2500|$|Travelling notionally {{from east}} to west, an escapee would first reach {{the edge of the}} {{restricted}} zone (...) , a closely controlled strip of land 5 kilometres (3.1mi) wide, running parallel with the border. Evading the patrols and watchful inhabitants of the Sperrzone, the escapee would have reached the first of the border fences. The signal fence (Signalzaun), around [...] from the actual border, was lined with <b>low-voltage</b> electrified barbed <b>wire</b> which activated alarms when touched or cut.|$|R
2500|$|The {{breaking}} capacity is the maximum current that can safely be {{interrupted by the}} fuse. [...] This should be higher than the prospective short-circuit current. Miniature fuses may have an interrupting rating only 10 times their rated current. Some fuses are designated High Rupture Capacity (HRC) and are usually filled with sand or a similar material. Fuses for small, <b>low-voltage,</b> usually residential, <b>wiring</b> systems are commonly rated, in North American practice, to interrupt 10,000 amperes. Fuses for commercial or industrial power systems must have higher interrupting ratings, with some low-voltage current-limiting high interrupting fuses rated for 300,000 amperes. Fuses for high-voltage equipment, up to 115,000 volts, are rated by the total apparent power (megavolt-amperes, MVA) of the fault level on the circuit.|$|R
50|$|In {{the event}} that the dropped ceiling is used as a plenum, <b>low-voltage</b> cables and <b>wiring</b> not {{installed}} inside conduit need to use a special low-smoke and low-toxicity wire insulation which will tend to char and stop burning on its own. This helps to protect building occupants so that they are not poisoned with toxic chemicals sucked through the ventilation system {{in the event of a}} fire, and helps to prevent fires from spreading inside the hidden plenum space. This special low-smoke cable is typically referred to as plenum cable or Low Smoke Zero Halogen (LSZH or LS0H) cable. While twisted pair cable for networking and telephone service is the most common form of plenum cable, coaxial cable also needs to be plenum-rated for safety.|$|R
5000|$|Electricians were {{originally}} people who demonstrated or studied {{the principles of}} electricity, often electrostatic generators of one form or another. In the United States, electricians are divided into two primary categories: linemen, who work on electric utility company distribution systems at higher voltages, and wiremen, who work with the lower voltages utilized inside buildings. Wiremen are generally trained in one of five primary specialties: commercial, residential, light industrial, industrial, and <b>low-voltage</b> <b>wiring,</b> more commonly known as Voice-Data-Video, or VDV. Other sub-specialties such as control wiring and fire-alarm may be performed by specialists trained in the devices being installed, or by inside wiremen. Electricians are trained {{to one of three}} levels: Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master Electrician. In the US and Canada, apprentices work and receive a reduced compensation while learning their trade. They generally take several hundred hours of classroom instruction and are contracted to follow apprenticeship standards for a period of between three and six years, during which time they are paid {{as a percentage of the}} Journeyman's pay. Journeymen are electricians who have completed their Apprenticeship and who have been found by the local, State, or National licensing body to be competent in the electrical trade. Master Electricians have performed well in the trade for a period of time, often seven to ten years, and have passed an exam to demonstrate superior knowledge of the National Electrical Code, or NEC. Service electricians are tasked to respond to requests for isolated repairs and upgrades. They have skills troubleshooting wiring problems, installing wiring in existing buildings, and making repairs. Construction electricians primarily focus on larger projects, such as installing all new electrical system for an entire building, or upgrading an entire floor of an office building as part of a remodeling process. Other specialty areas are marine electricians, research electricians and hospital electricians. [...] "Electrician" [...] is also used as the name of a role in stagecraft, where electricians are tasked primarily with hanging, focusing, and operating stage lighting. In this context, the Master Electrician is the show's chief electrician. Although theater electricians routinely perform electrical work on stage lighting instruments and equipment, they are not part of the electrical trade and have a different set of skills and qualifications from the electricians that work on building wiring. In the film industry and on a television crew the head electrician is referred to as a Gaffer. Electrical contractors are businesses that employ electricians to design, install, and maintain electrical systems. Contractors are responsible for generating bids for new jobs, hiring tradespeople for the job, providing material to electricians in a timely manner, and communicating with architects, electrical and building engineers, and the customer to plan and complete the finished product.|$|R
