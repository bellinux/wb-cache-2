However, a charter of June 1323 states that the child had died <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>month.</b> The second son of Charles and Elisabeth, Ladislaus, was born in 1324. The marriage of Ladislaus and Anne, a daughter of King John of Bohemia, was planned by their parents, but Ladislaus died in 1329.

His younger brothers, Andrew and Stephen, who were born in 1327 and 1332, respectively, also survived Charles.|$|E

25|$|More {{recently}} Dario Sabbatucci {{has given}} a different interpretation {{of the meaning of}} Stator within the frame of his structuralistic and dialectic vision of Roman calendar, identifying oppositions, tensions and equilibria: January is the month of Janus, {{at the beginning of the}} year, in the uncertain time of winter (the most ancient calendar had only ten months, from March to December). <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>month</b> Janus deifies kingship and defies Jupiter. Moreover, January sees also the presence of Veiovis who appears as an anti-Jupiter, of Carmenta who is the goddess of birth and like Janus has two opposed faces, Prorsa and Postvorta (also named Antevorta and Porrima), of Iuturna, who as a gushing spring evokes the process of coming into being from non-being as the god of passage and change does. In this period the preeminence of Janus needs compensating on the Ides through the action of Jupiter Stator, who plays the role of anti-Janus, i.e. of moderator of the action of Janus.|$|E
