NASA managers opted to roll back the vehicle to the VAB on 7 March, and then to OPF for repair. The faulty hinges were replaced with units taken from orbiter Columbia, and reinforced. Discovery was returned to the pad on 1 April, and the launch was rescheduled for 23 April. The mission was again postponed when, during prelaunch external tank loading, a transducer on high-pressure oxidizer turbopump for main engine number three showed readings out of specification. The transducer and its cable harness were replaced and tested. The launch was rescheduled for 28 April. Actual launch occurred at 28 April 1991, 7:33:14 am EDT. Launch weight: 112207 kg.|$|E

40|$|A 5 th order {{polynomial}} {{spline function}} {{is applied to}} the position command generation of the SOFIA cavity <b>door</b> <b>drive</b> system in order to limit jerk. By limiting the door jerk, a smooth acceleration profile is achieved and less current demand is required to provide door actuation. The existing drive system suffers from unanticipated high current demand during tracking mode,specifically over very frequent, short door trajectories. The high current demand is inherent to the aggressive trapezoidal acceleration profile. The 5 th order polynomial spline function is chosen for not only its smooth velocity and acceleration profile, but more importantly, for its manipulation into closed-form expressions for predicting <b>door</b> <b>drive</b> dynamics and motor terminal behavior. It is shown that from the 5 th order polynomial position function, one can derive closedform expressions for velocity, acceleration, and jerk. These expressions are applied to the wellknown electromechanical differential equation and the DC motor voltage equation to develop closed-form current and power expressions that includes the jerk limited track mode behavior and the door dynamics. The performance of the <b>door</b> <b>drive</b> system is then predicted under this jerk limited track mode and verified in the Matlab/Simulink environment. The simulation results of the jerk limited track mode show that while door response slightly decreases, current demand is vastly reduced...|$|E

To model the flexibility of the DDM, a lumped parameter approximation was used to capture the compliance of individual parts within the drive linkage. These stiffness approximations were then validated using FEA and iteratively updated in the model to converge on the actual distributed parameter equivalent stiffnesses. The goal of the analyses is to determine the deflections in the mechanism and whether or not the deflections are in the region of elastic or plastic deformation. Plastic deformation may affect proper closure of the ETD and would impact aero-heating during re-entry...|$|E

40|$|In an {{electro-mechanical}} integration {{system where}} loads {{consist of a}} mechanical system, the electrical system specification and configuration {{will depend on the}} mechanical system. Therefore, inaccurate parameters of the mechanical system will make difficult the selection of electrical system specification and the effective controller design. Of these, the controller design often adopts an experimental method [12] or a method using numerical analysis [13]. With such methods, however, it is difficult to predict the actual system in advance followed by specification selection and controller design. Hence, to perform a faster and more accurate modeling of the system, a collaborative analysis is required for two physically different systems in a virtual space. In the present article, a method of an electro-mechanical collaborative analysis is proposed for an elevator <b>door</b> <b>drive</b> system. From mechanical load modeling using simulation, an electrical requirement specification has been derived. In addition, a C++-based collaboration program has been developed that can connect mutually different physical domains according to the proposed collaborative analysis procedures.

30|$|The {{analysis}} {{model was}} applied to the passenger door unit of a fleet of 38 Class 380 trains operating on Scotlandâs railway network. The data required for the analysis were collected from the literature, the companyâs maintenance management software system called EQUINOX, the UKâs railway performance management software DATASYS BUGLE and the UKâs train movements monitoring system called TRUST. The five whyâs technique was used to identify the potential failure modes of door unit components and their root causes, including the defects in relation to pushbuttons, door control unit (DCU), mechanical failures, light barrier, <b>door</b> <b>drive,</b> guard operating panel (GOP), limit switches, loose plugs, obstructions, door roller and lubrication. The results of the risk evaluation showed that the nine failure modes (12 Â % {{of the total number of}} failure modes identified) are âhigh criticalâ to door system functionality. The results of this study were used not only for assessing the performance of current maintenance practices, but also to plan a cost-effective preventive maintenance (PM) programme for different components of rolling stock. To avoid the recurrence of the failure modes, a new mileage-based preventive maintenance (PM) programme including 14 tasks was proposed.|$|E
40|$|Upon observing an {{abnormal}} {{closure of the}} Space Shuttle s External Tank Doors (ETD), a dynamic model was created in MSC/ADAMS to conduct deflection analyses of the <b>Door</b> <b>Drive</b> Mechanism (DDM). For a similar analysis, the traditional approach would be to construct a full finite element model of the mechanism. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to describe an alternative approach that models the flexibility of the DDM using a lumped parameter approximation to capture the compliance of individual parts within the drive linkage. This approach allows for rapid construction of a dynamic model in a time-critical setting, while still retaining the appropriate equivalent stiffness of each linkage component. As a validation of these equivalent stiffnesses, finite element analysis (FEA) was used to iteratively update the model towards convergence. Following this analysis, deflections recovered from the dynamic model can be used to calculate stress and classify each component s deformation as either elastic or plastic. Based on the modeling assumptions used in this analysis and the maximum input forcing condition, two components in the DDM show a factor of safety less than or equal to 0. 5. However, to accurately evaluate the induced stresses, additional mechanism rigging information would be necessary to characterize the input forcing conditions. This information would also allow for the classification of stresses as either elastic or plastic...|$|E
