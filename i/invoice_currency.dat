This study finds that the euro could play an increasing role as the <b>invoice</b> <b>currency</b> of Chinese firms, although the US dollar will still play a dominant role.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{theoretical}} model {{of international trade}} pricing in which individual exporters and importers bargain over the transaction price and exposure to exchange rate fluctuations.

Our study shows that a party has a higher effective bargaining weight when it is large or more risk tolerant. A higher effective bargaining weight of importers relative to exporters in turn translates into lower import prices and greater exchange rate pass-through into import prices. We show the range of price and invoicing outcomes that arise under alternative market structures.

However, existing studies have mostly ignored an important characteristic of East Asia, i. e., most of its international trade is invoiced in the U. S. dollars. This paper investigates how the preponderance of dollar invoicing affects optimal currency basket regimes for East Asian economies. I develop a three-country center-periphery sticky-price dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model for the analysis. The model is solved numerically by taking second-order approximations to the policy functions with the expected lifetime utility of households chosen as the welfare criterion. Contrary to the conjecture of existing literature, I show that predominance of dollar invoicing implies that the dollar should receive a smaller weight than suggested by bilateral trade shares between emerging markets in East Asia and the United States.

40|$|Although {{currency}} invoicing {{in international}} trade transactions {{is central to the}} transmission of monetary policy, the forces motivating the choice of currency have long been debated. We introduce a model wherein agents involved {{in international trade}} can invoice in the exporter's currency, the importer's currency, or a third-country vehicle currency. The model is designed to contrast the contribution of macroeconomic variability with that of industry-specific features in the selection of an <b>invoice</b> <b>currency.</b> We show that producers in industries with high demand elasticities are more likely than producers in other industries to display herding in their choice of currency. This industry-related force is more influential than local macroeconomic performance in determining producers' choices. Drawing on data on <b>invoice</b> <b>currency</b> use in exports and imports for twenty-four countries, we document that the dollar is the currency of choice for most transactions involving the United States. The dollar is also extensively used as a vehicle currency in international trade flows that do not directly involve the United States. Consistent with the results of our model, this last finding is largely attributable to international trade in reference-priced and organized-exchange traded goods. Although the magnitude of business-cycle volatility matters for invoicing of more differentiated products, it is less central for invoicing nondifferentiated goods. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} why the choice of <b>invoice</b> <b>currency</b> under exchange rate uncertainty depends not only on expectations but also on history. The analysis is motivated by the fact that the U. S. dollar has historically been the dominant vehicle currency in developing countries. The theoretical analysis is based on an open economy model of monopolistic competition. When the market is competitive enough, the exporting firms tend to set their prices not to deviate from those of the competitors. As a result, a coordination failure can lead the third currency to be a less efficient equilibrium <b>invoice</b> <b>currency.</b> The role of expectations is important in selecting the equilibrium in the static framework. However, in the dynamic model with staggered price-setting, the role of history becomes another key determinant of the equilibrium currency pricing. The role of history may dominate the role of expectations when the firms are myopic, particularly in the competitive local market. It also becomes dominant in the staggered price setting when a small fraction of the new price setters are backward-looking. The result suggests the importance of history in explaining why the firm tends to choose the US dollar as vehicle currency. ...|$|E

The export prices are set before exchange rates are known. When the market is competitive enough, the exporting firms tend to set their prices not to deviate from those of the competitors. As a result, when the other exporters set their prices in the third currency, the exporting firm tends to choose the third currency as an equilibrium <b>invoice</b> <b>currency.</b> The tendency becomes conspicuous in the market where the shares of local firms are small. The latter part of the paper empirically investigates the relevancy of the theoretical results by using the export price data in Korea. We find that export prices in Korea are highly stable in terms of the US dollar even in the commodities for which Japan has had dominant shares. We also find that export prices in Korea are more stable against the US dollar in the commodities for which the shares of local firms are small in Japan. The empirical results are consistent with our theoretical model. The result may explain why the firm tends to set prices in the US dollar even if the United States is not a trade partner. ...|$|E

Second, because Canadian firms often use the US dollar as the <b>invoicing</b> <b>currency</b> for both imports and exports, they undertake most of the currency risk.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the firm-level pricing behavior of Japanese exports to present new evidence and determinants of an <b>invoice</b> <b>currency.</b> We interviewed twenty-three major Japanese exporting firms {{to collect information}} on their currency invoicing behavior and also on their explicit policy/strategy for choosing an <b>invoice</b> <b>currency.</b> New findings in the destination breakdown of the share of currency invoicing are presented in four major exporting industries: automobile, electric machinery, general machinery and electronic component industries. We also propose six possible determinants of currency invoicing in Japanese exports: (i) intra- or inter-firm trade; (ii) cost of exchange rate hedging; (iii) the degree of market competition and differentiation of exporting products; (iv) the share of exporting products customarily traded in U. S. dollars; (v) exports from an Asian production base to the U. S. market; (vi) explicit policy of choosing a specific currency for invoicing. By constructing a firm-level dataset obtained from annual securities and financial reports of each sample firm, we conduct both cross-section OLS and probit estimation to empirically examine the determinants of currency invoicing at a firm-level export. Our novel findings are three-fold. First, importers' currency invoicing is prevalent in Japanese exports to developed countries. Since most exports of sample firms are destined for local subsidiaries that face severe competition in the local markets, Japanese parent firms have a strong tendency to take on exchange rate risk by invoicing in the importer's currency, {{which is consistent with}} the pricing-to-market (PTM) behavior discussed in the literature. Second, a large share of exports of electronics products that are customarily invoiced in U. S. dollars promotes U. S. -dollar invoicing even in exports to non-U. S. markets. Third, although Japanese firms have shifted their production bases to Asian countries, exports from these Asian bases tend to be invoiced in U. S. dollars as long as the final destination market is the United States. Given that U. S. -dollar invoicing is prevalent in Asia, both Japanese and Asian firms take exchange rate risks against the U. S. dollar. Establishing a common currency basket in Asia is worth considering to mitigate the exchange rate risk for both Japanese and Asian firms. ...|$|E

This suggests that the current measures for improving Japanese financial markets are, by themselves, likely to have only a limited impact on expanding the use of the yen as a denomination for trade transactions, given the current international competitiveness and market share of Japan’s manufacturing industry and the current exchange rate regimes.

40|$|The U. S. {{dollar is}} the central {{reference}} currency for international trade pricing and the main <b>invoicing</b> <b>currency</b> for primary commodities. This paper links these two observations within a stylized theoretical framework, and shows how to obtain a quantitative estimate of the gain to the U. S. economy when the dollar is a reference <b>currency.</b> With dollar <b>invoicing</b> of primary commodities, U. S. firms bear less exchange rate risk than foreign firms. This asymmetry leads to a dollar standard in international goods pricing. We then derive a simple analytical formula to calculate the gains and find that they are extremely small.
