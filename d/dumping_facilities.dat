50|$|In {{the mid-1990s}} the Madrid {{government}} pursued initiatives {{to eliminate the}} shantytowns surrounding the city. One such shantytown settlement, Los Focos, was the largest in Spain, and also composed predominantly of ethnic Romani (of Spanish nationality). During this time, the municipal government, under the conservative Popular Party, set out to initiate plans for the relocation of Los Focos to Cañada Real Galiana, where 100 single-storey houses were to be constructed in immediate proximity to the Madrid garbage incinerator, a dump, and an illegal pig farm. In the opinion of Gonick,In such physical proximity, relocated bodies and the city's refuse would face certain, constant coexistence. The blatant disregard for {{the health and safety}} of this population betrays the state's racialized vision of their urban futures: like sacks of garbage, these residents represented blight on the city, to be discarded out of sight. Such alliances between bodies and filth are of course ancient tropes in the production of spaces of value and inequality (Douglas 1966; McClintock 1995).Negative publicity led to a cancellation of the relocation program, although by that point, residents were already starting to be relocated to Valdemingómez. Currently, Valdemingómez is a low-income yet highly multi-ethnic shantytown. Located south of Highway E-901 and east of Highway M 50, Valdemingómez is named after the waste processing, incineration, and <b>dumping</b> <b>facilities</b> which it is adjacent to, and is a site of extreme social marginalization. An estimated 4,500 trucks a day pass through the main road of the settlement daily en route to the dump and recycling facilities, raising concerns over safety, particularly for children. There are no sidewalks, traffic lights, or pedestrian crossings along the road, and several children have been killed by trucks.|$|E

40|$|This thesis investigates {{an area of}} {{beyond the}} Standard Model (BSM) {{phenomenology}} associated {{with the presence of}} additional light, “weakly interacting slim particles” (WISPs). Particular attention is given to the hidden photon, the gauge boson associated with an additional U(1) gauge group that mixes kinetically with hypercharge. The theoretical foundation of the interactions studied lies in effective field theory, and {{the first part of the}} thesis investigates a so-far untested aspect of effective theories, namely effective non-locality in particle propagation. There are no observable effects of hidden photons if they are massless. We investigate the impact on experimental signatures in the case that the hidden photon gets its mass during compactification from a higher dimensional theory. WISPs make good dark matter candidates, and are especially compelling in light of the lack of observation of heavy WIMP (“weakly interacting massive particle”) dark matter. Nonetheless, it is shown that if WIMP dark matter is composed of a Dirac fermion that couples to the SM only through a pseudoscalar, indirect detection may be our only experimental window, and that it may already be appearing as a gamma ray excess at the Galactic Centre. There is considerable interest in dark matter searches at beam <b>dump</b> <b>facilities,</b> in particular for light dark matter coupled through a similarly light mediator particle. We investigate this set up in the context of the E 613 beam dump experiment. Owing to the light mediator, the low-Q^ 2 kinematic region of deep inelastic scattering is especially important.

40|$|Purpose – The “environmental justice” {{movement}} {{has suggested that}} demographic inequities characterize the location of hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDFs). While some researchers have found evidence that TSDFs are disproportionately located in minority areas, others attribute TSDF location to non-racial factors such as income and industrial employment. Design/methodology/approach – Both univariate and multivariate techniques were used to analyse the location of TSDFs in Los Angeles County, California; the focus on one county allowed this paper to overcome the problem of “fake” addresses for TSDF sites and to introduce specific land use/zoning variables that are not used in the other studies. Findings – Findings from the univariate results and the multivariate model reveal that: industrial land use and manufacturing employment do matter, as suggested by critics of environmental justice; income has first a positive, then {{a negative effect on}} TSDF location, a pattern that likely reflects the fact that the poorest communities have little economic activity, while wealthier communities have the economic and political power to resist negative environmental externalities; and race and ethnicity are still significantly associated with TSDF location, even when percentage African American and percentage Latino are evaluated as separate groupings. Research limitations/implications – All 82 Los Angeles County TSDFs currently listed by the California State Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) are included in the study. Practical implications – Taken together, the results suggest that communities most affected by TSDFs in the Los Angeles area are working-class and ethnic minorities located near industrial areas.

40|$|Our {{interest}} in the applications of thermoelasticity is mainly due to the research activities {{in the field of}} beam <b>dumping</b> <b>facility</b> design for particle accelerators, in particular for the new LHC at CERN. Interaction between high energy particle beams with targets is responsible for sudden and concentrated heating of the material of the targets, this give rise to stress waves propagating inside their structure, that in some cases may be dangerous for structure stability. Well focused beams with high energy produce more intense stress waves with a smaller characteristic wavelength, the simulation of these phenomena becomes more important but also more challenging for the computational effort involved. We have therefore applied the spectral element technology developed at CRS 4 to this particular class of problems, the resulting tools have already been used, in an early stage, for a case study for the TOF experiment at CERN. Anyway, deformation and stresses due to temperature gradients are common practice in design. While most of the normal application may be solved under the hypothesis of stationarity for the elastic or the thermal part of the problem, there is a class of applications for which this kind of approximation is not admissible and a transient solution of the thermal and elastic problems is required. Apart from the afore mentioned beam dumping problem, examples may be found in almost every branch of engineering, and their study has long been a subject matter of wide spread research activity and interest, mainly in the field of non classical heat transmission models and thermomechanical interaction. In this repost a basic formulation of the general transient thermoelastic problem will be given, then the solution method, using spectral elements, will be described, and finally a simple reference test case will be analyzed...|$|R

Nanmadol, the strongest typhoon to affect the Philippines in 2011, killed two children in a landslide and left two fishermen missing. Later, the NDRRMC started forced evacuations in some areas of the Cagayan province after storm warning signal 4 has been raised. The typhoon's eye passed over the city of Santa Ana with the 24-hour rainfall accumulation over 400 mm. The typhoon also enhanced the Southwest Monsoonal Flow across the Philippines bringing heavy rains and squalls. Another big issue was that the typhoon slowed down after landfall and did not move much in six hours, leaving the northern half of the nation in danger {{for a longer period of}} time. Some thirteen families were evacuated from the Isabela province which was earlier hit by the typhoon as the governed ordered dam officials to release water if conditions worsen at the Magat Dam. Nanmadol's strong winds toppled trees, power and communication lines triggering power outages in the provinces of Cagayan and Isabela.

40|$|The {{western waters}} of Hong Kong {{have long been}} {{subjected}} to pollution from the Pearl River flow, local discharges and contaminated sediment disposal facilities. An increasing number of major coastal development projects including the Hong Kong – Zhuhai – Macao Bridge, has posed a threat and further deteriorated the already poor water quality in the area. The cumulative water quality impact arisen from many concurrent developments is significant and {{beyond the scope of}} project-specific environmental impact assessment (EIA) and environmental monitoring and audit (EM&A). In order to provide a comprehensive picture of how the individual developments combined to affect western waters, this study reviewed the recent and future development studies and identified 18 major development projects which could affect water quality in western waters over a 20 -year period (2005 - 2024). A computer tool making use of Delft 3 D model was developed to input the collected data for assessing the cumulative water quality impact of on-going projects and predicting the impact of those in the pipeline. Three timeframes were chosen for this study: baseline condition (2005 - 2008), recent projects (2009 - 2015) and future projects (2016 - 2024). The baseline water quality before the intensive developments took place in the western waters was analyzed. The characteristics of the western body were found to have high concentrations of suspended solids (SS) and total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) with moderate dissolved oxygen (DO) levels. For the three recent projects under the Hong Kong – Zhuhai – Macao Bridge mega project, large sediment plumes were generated and frequently exceeded SS limits, resulting in a substantial decline in water quality. For future works to be carried out in 2016 - 2024, combined impacts from six reclamation projects and a <b>dumping</b> <b>facility</b> for contaminated mud were determined by the water quality model. During the construction phase, SS and other parameters were projected to be greatly elevated and the extent of sediment plume was immense when all projects are going at the same time. Thus, proper phasing of marine construction works is recommended to minimise the cumulative water quality impact to avoid the adverse impact on human and marine life. During the operation phase of the projects, SS will largely return to normal but TIN will rise further and DO will decrease due to increase in population and activities. A more holistic and strategic planning, reducing pollutants from new projects as well as existing pollution sources, is therefore essential for improving the water quality of western waters. published_or_final_versionEnvironmental ManagementMasterMaster of Science in Environmental Managemen...|$|R

They reached Kalili Harbour on 31 January but after learning that the fighting on New Britain was over and that the Japanese had occupied Rabaul, it was decided to sail for Port Moresby.|$|R

Both campaigns required the support of very large numbers of troops, animals and equipment in hostile environments. They produced a well-developed system of stores <b>dumps</b> and repair <b>facilities</b> along extended lines-of-communication. The two decades before the First World War saw the increasing mechanization of the Army but this was largely undertaken on a piecemeal basis. The ordnance role largely remained confined to artillery with the ASC leading the way with vehicles and the RE with aviation and communications. Much {{of the story of}} the next hundred years of Army logistics is the reorganization and steady rationalization of these and other technical changes.|$|R
