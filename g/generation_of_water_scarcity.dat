Second, <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> is fundamentally a normative, anthropocentric concept and, thus, can and should be distinguished from the related, purely descriptive notion <b>of</b> <b>water</b> deficit. While such an anthropocentric perspective may seem limiting, it has the potential to encompass the vast range of interests that society has in water. Third, our ability to understand and anticipate changes in <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> requires distinguishing between the factors that affect the value or benefits <b>of</b> <b>water</b> from those affecting the costs <b>of</b> transforming <b>water</b> in space, time and form.

40|$|Non-edited document] The {{main goal}} of this {{research}} is flush pointing major economic issues related to the economic impact assessment <b>of</b> <b>water</b> availability in the Zayandeh Rud basin in Iran. It goes without saying that economic assessments would start with considering water as a scarce commodity or a resource and then magnifying the intensity of scarcity along with variables or factors affecting the level of scarcity occurred or predicted to occur, for some determined span of time in the future. Having magnified the intensity <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> the economics tools to deal with <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> is analyzed, such that goals defined i. e. food security and environmental concern along with growth are met. To show the intensity <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> there are three main indices being used in the natural resource economics field namely: unit cost <b>of</b> providing <b>water,</b> market price or its shadow price, and rental value <b>of</b> <b>water</b> rights which include value paid to have access to the use of one cubic meter <b>of</b> <b>water</b> for duration <b>of</b> a year.

40|$|Many {{international}} river basins {{are likely}} to experience increasing <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> over the coming decades. This <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> is not rooted only in the limitation of resources, i. e. the shortage in the availability of freshwater relative to water demand, but also on social factors (e. g. flawed water planning and management approaches, institutional incapability to provide water services, unsustainable economic policies). Therefore, the assessment <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> risks {{is not limited to}} the assessment <b>of</b> physical <b>water</b> supply and demand, but it requires also consideration of several socio-economic factors. In this study, we provide a comprehensive dynamic assessment <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> risks for the Lower Brahmaputra river basin, a region where the hydrological impact of climate change is expected to be particularly strong and population pressure is high. The basin area of Brahmaputra River lies among four different countries: China, India, Bangladesh and Bhutan. For <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> assessment, we propose a novel integration of different approaches: (i) the assessment <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> risk, considering complex social-ecological system; (ii) the analysis of dynamic behaviour of the system; (iii) exploration of participatory approach in which limited number of stakeholders identify the most relevant issues with reference to <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> risks and provide their preferences for the aggregation of risk assessment indicators. Results show that <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> risk is expected to slightly increase and to fluctuate remarkably as a function of the hazard signal.

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{construction}} of the discourse <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> in Jordan. First, it identifies the actors constructing the discourse, their interests, and the elements comprising the discourse. Second, it examines the effects of the deployment of the discourse <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> on policy-options, analysing the solutions opened and closed by the discourse in the national water strategy. Third, it explores the effects of the deployment of the discourse on transboundary water governance, as well as what other factors shape Jordanian-Syrian, Jordanian-Israeli, and Jordanian-Saudi hydropolitical relations. The study is important and makes an original empirical contribution because while the issue <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> in Jordan has been widely researched, it has been done mainly from an engineering perspective, the discourse <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> has been taken for granted, and studies on an in depth discursive analysis of the issue <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> in Jordan are still missing. Moreover, a study on the relation between the deployment of the discourse <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> and transboundary <b>water</b> governance in the case of Jordan is still lacking. Research undertaken in other contexts on this topic shows that discourses are being deployed to sanction and open certain solutions rather than others. It also shows that policies are designed and implemented in line with dominant discourses. The main methods of data collection are documentation - including reports, academic articles, and newspapers - as well as semi-structured interviews with relevant individuals involved in the construction and reproduction of the discourse. Interviews are deployed also to collect data on the transboundary water governance and bilateral relations. The data are analysed through Fairclough’s theoretical framework of critical discourse analysis, which applied to this case study represents a methodological contribution to knowledge. The study finds that there is a single dominant discourse <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>scarcity,</b> which is composed <b>of</b> two narratives: <b>water</b> insufficiency and water mismanagement. The water insufficiency narrative is constructed to emphasise factors external to the responsibility of the Jordanian government as reasons for <b>water</b> <b>scarcity,</b> like nature, refugees, and neighbouring countries. It is mainly constructed by governmental oriented actors and deployed to open solutions on the supply and conservation sides and ultimately {{to maintain the status quo}} <b>of</b> the current <b>water</b> uses. The water mismanagement narrative is constructed to emphasise as reasons for <b>water</b> <b>scarcity</b> factors <b>of</b> mismanagement <b>of</b> <b>water</b> resources, and deployed to increase economic efficiency in the water sector. The actors behind this narrative are mainly donors and international organisations. The water mismanagement narrative is deployed to open mainly vii demand oriented policies and solutions on the conservation side, ultimately challenging the status quo <b>of</b> the current <b>water</b> uses. However, the water mismanagement narrative is not dominant, and therefore does not have a major impact on the policies. The results suggest that the dominant and mainstream narrative is water insufficiency and the most prominent solutions that this narrative opens are on the supply side and particularly of transboundary nature: the Disi and the Red Sea Dead Sea Canal projects. By highlighting how the discourse is constructed and deployed to shape solutions and policies, the study shows the relevance of including a discursive analysis of the national dominant narrative into the analysis <b>of</b> <b>water</b> policies and transboundary water governance.

This approach is applied to agricultural production data for major crops (orchard/vineyard, vegetable, wheat, alfalfa, hay, and pasture) on the West Coast (California, Oregon, and Washington). Crop-specific modeling provides information about the distributional impacts of agricultural policy and climate change.
