40|$|Bachelor thesis "Influence of the {{attitude}} of the public towards the European Union on <b>eurosceptic</b> parties' formation and ideology" deals with the relation between a public opinion on European union and development of <b>eurosceptic</b> parties. The thesis researching whether <b>eurosceptic</b> parties are tend to be populists, so they are adapting their programs according to public opinion on EU, or if they are more standoffish to this surveys. This thesis also tries to find out differences between hard and soft <b>eurosceptic</b> parties in their relation to opinion surveys. These issues are researched on a sample of six <b>eurosceptic</b> parties from different countries of Europe. Political programs are put into context with regular Europe-wide opinion surveys named Eurobarometer. Secondary question is possibility of reverse influence - when <b>eurosceptic</b> party changing level of euroscepticism in its country. Last, but not least, thesis brings insight into the possible transformation from soft to hard <b>eurosceptic</b> and vice versa...|$|R
50|$|In June 2012, the <b>Eurosceptic</b> {{parties in}} Greece that were {{represented}} in the parliament before the Election in January 2015 (ANEL, Golden Dawn, KKE) got 45.8% of the votes and 40.3% of {{the seats in the}} parliament. In the legislative election of January 2015 the pro-European (left and right-wing) parties (ND, PASOK, Potami, KIDISO, EK and Prasinoi-DIMAR) got 43.28% of the votes. The <b>Eurosceptic</b> parties got 54.64%.

The <b>Eurosceptic</b> parties got 194 seats in the new parliament and the pro-EU parties got 106 seats. According to the polls conducted in June and July 2015 (12 polls), the <b>Eurosceptic</b> left would get on average 48.03% (excluding extraparliamentary parties as ANTARSYA-MARS and KKE (m-l)/ML-KKE), the parliamentary pro-EU parties (Potami, New Democracy and PASOK) would get 33.82%, the extra-parliamentary (not {{represented in the}} Hellenic Parliament) pro-EU parties (KIDISO and EK) would get 4.44% and the <b>Eurosceptic</b> right would get 10.2% (excluding extraparliamentary parties, such as LAOS, not displayed on recent opinion polls).

25|$|In {{recent years}} the Conservative Party has shown to have members with a mixed opinion of the EU, with pro-European Conservatives joining the {{affiliate}} Conservative Group for Europe, whilst some <b>Eurosceptics</b> have left the party to join the United Kingdom Independence Party.

25|$|European social-democrats {{strongly}} support Europeanism and supranational integration, {{although there is}} a minority of nationalists and <b>eurosceptics</b> also in the left. Some link this left-wing nationalism to the pressure generated by economic integration with other countries encouraged by free-trade agreements. This view is sometimes used to justify hostility towards supranational organizations. Left-wing nationalism can also refer to any nationalism which emphasises a working-class populist agenda which seeks to overcome perceived exploitation or oppression by other nations. Many Third World anti-colonial movements adopted left-wing and socialist ideas.|$|E
25|$|Repair {{work began}} immediately, {{but it became}} {{apparent}} that it could not be repaired in time for the next sitting. Thus, the session starting on 1 September was moved to the Brussels hemicycle. Parliament was expected to move back to Strasbourg for the session starting on 22 September but had to remain in Brussels for that session as well as safety inspections dragged on. The event was greeted with joy by those who oppose the Parliament's presence in Strasbourg, and mocked by <b>eurosceptics</b> who wore hard hats to the first plenary in Brussels after the incident (if Parliament had been sitting at the time, the collapsing ceiling would have hit members of the eurosceptic parties).|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} whether {{the support for}} <b>Eurosceptic</b> challenger parties influences mainstream party position change on European integration in Western Europe. The key finding is that <b>Eurosceptic</b> challenger support is capable of influencing mainstream position shifts on European integration provided that, on average, EU issues are regarded as important by the <b>Eurosceptic</b> challengers. Moreover, the centre-left is more affected by <b>Eurosceptic</b> contagion since it is influenced by both radical right and radical left <b>Eurosceptic</b> success, whereas the centre-right is only susceptible to radical right success. The empirical analyses are based on panel regression analysis employing expert survey data provided by Chapel Hill Expert Survey. The findings {{presented in this article}} have important implications for the study of party positioning on European integration {{as well as for the}} study of party competition in general...|$|R
40|$|This project {{argues that}} <b>Eurosceptic</b> {{challenger}} parties can affect mainstream parties’ attitudes toward European integration in Western Europe. Defined as anti-European parties without governing experience, <b>Eurosceptic</b> challengers {{have become a}} pervasive electoral phenomenon. On the backdrop of both spatial theory and issue saliency theory of party competition, this project argues that <b>Eurosceptic</b> challenger parties can influence mainstream parties’ positions on as well as emphasis of the European integration issue. After comparative overview of party-based Euroscepticism, a historical and descriptive quantitative analysis of mainstream EU positions and EU issue salience demonstrates that mainstream party attitudes vary significantly over time – an important precondition for <b>Eurosceptic</b> challengers’ programmatic influence.

The Bruges Group is considered to be the common ancestor of the many British <b>Eurosceptic</b> parties and groups that emerged in the 1990s.|$|R
25|$|The {{day after}} the {{government}} was defeated at the 1997 General Election, Heseltine suffered an attack of angina and had a tube inserted into an artery; he declined to stand for the Conservative Party leadership again. However, he was less unpopular with <b>eurosceptics</b> than Clarke, and on the third ballot of the subsequent leadership election Clarke, facing imminent defeat by William Hague, offered to stand aside in Heseltine's favour, but he declined on medical advice. He became active in promoting the benefits for Britain of joining the Single European Currency, appearing on the same stage as Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Robin Cook {{as part of an}} all-party campaign to promote Euro membership. He was also made a Companion of Honour in the 1997 resignation Honours List. In November 1999 Heseltine was invited by Hague to be the Conservative candidate for the new position of Mayor of London (in place of Jeffrey Archer who had had to stand down because of scandal), but he declined.|$|E
25|$|A {{legislative}} {{snap election}} for the National Council in Austria {{was held on}} 28 September 2008. The previous election was held on 1 October 2006. The election (the 24th in Austrian history) {{was caused by the}} withdrawal of Austrian People's Party leader Wilhelm Molterer from the governing grand coalition (led by the Social Democratic Party of Austria) on 7 July 2008. Due to dissatisfaction with the grand coalition and the two main parties, it was widely expected to be a realigning election, with gains for the opposition and up to seven parties expected to be in the National Council after the election. The losses for the government parties (both the SPÖ and the ÖVP had the worst election result in history) resulted in strong gains for the far right, while neither the Liberal Forum nor the Citizens' Forum Austria (both of which were considered to have chances of gaining seats) gained as much as 2% of the vote, defying earlier expectations. The result of the election was seen as strong for the far-right and in support of <b>Eurosceptics.</b>|$|E
500|$|Early {{supporters}} fell largely {{into three}} types: committed <b>Eurosceptics,</b> disaffected Conservatives, and those who—though not necessarily being Eurosceptic—strongly {{believed that the}} British population deserved a referendum on EU membership. At the time the new party was largely seen {{as a threat to}} the governing Conservative Party, which was experiencing high levels of mid-term unpopularity. In September 1995, the party began recruiting candidates to contest the next general election. Goldsmith was also able to obtain celebrity endorsements. Despite Goldsmith's longstanding criticism of the mainstream media—he had previously stated that [...] "reporting in England is a load of filth"—the party used its finances to promote its message in the media. It hired Ian Beaumont, who had formerly been the press officer to Thatcher's government, to work for it. The party paid for many full-page and some double-page advertisement in the UK's national newspapers, as well as two cinema advertisements. This generated criticism from those who accused it of [...] "cheque-book politics" [...] in the manner of Perot in the US. This financial backing and infrastructure contrasted with that of another single-issue Eurosceptic Party, the UK Independence Party (UKIP), which was operating with little finances and a skeleton organisation at the time.|$|E

40|$|Available online 29 April 2016 This paper {{analyses}} how disaffection {{with the}} EU influenced individuals' likelihood of {{turning out to}} vote and of casting a vote for a <b>Eurosceptic</b> party in the 2014 EP elections, and how these relationships were moderated by the <b>Eurosceptic</b> partisan supply of each country. We argue that {{the degree to which}} political parties oppose European integration, as well as the ideological leaning of <b>Eurosceptic</b> parties, should influence both the likelihood of disaffected citizens turning out to vote, and their likelihood of voting for a <b>Eurosceptic</b> party. Our empirical findings show that, {{in the presence of a}} party that is strongly opposed to European integration, disaffected citizens are more likely to turn out to vote and to vote for a <b>Eurosceptic</b> party provided that this party also shares their ideological leaning in the left-right dimension. These results indicate that <b>Eurosceptic</b> parties are important actors for the politicization of the European integration conflict and for the Europeanization of EP elections, but, at the same time, they suggest that opposition to European integration is subordinate to the traditional left-right conflict.

40|$|In {{the wake}} of the harshest {{economic}} crisis since 1929, in several European countries there has been a rise of <b>Eurosceptic</b> parties that oppose EU integration. The 2014 European Parliament elections were a fundamental turning point for these parties. In this article, after a theoretical discussion on the concept of Euroscepticism, we provide an updated classification of <b>Eurosceptic</b> parties after the 2014 European Parliament elections. We show the cross-country variability of such parties' results and present two hypotheses aiming at explaining <b>Eurosceptic</b> parties' results, one related to each country's economic context and one related to each country's political-institutional context. Through a comparative approach and the use of quantitative data, we test the two hypotheses by creating two standardised indices of economic and political-institutional contexts. Three important findings are shown: <b>Eurosceptic</b> parties perform better in either rich, creditor countries or in poor countries; <b>Eurosceptic</b> parties perform better in countries with peculiar political-institutional features, such as high levels of party system instability and a more permissive electoral system; finally, and crucially, favourable political-institutional contexts seem to be more important than favourable economic contexts for <b>Eurosceptic</b> parties' electoral results...|$|R

The reformist subgroup {{was able to}} pursue a reformist agenda via the Parliament. The secessionist subgroup was unable to pursue a secessionist agenda there (it's out of the Parliament's purview) and pursued a right-wing agenda instead. Ironically, this resulted in the secessionist subgroup being less eurosceptic in terms of roll-call votes than other, non-eurosceptic parties. UKIP (the major component of the secessionist subgroup) was criticised for this seeming abandonment of its Eurosceptic core principles.|$|E

[...] Opinion on the prospect of the plan coming to fruition is mixed. British <b>Eurosceptics</b> (those critical of the European Union) have expressed a preference for a relationship [...] "similar in nature and goals to the EU" [...] between the same four countries: the CANZUK Union.—though this possibility has also been characterised as [...] "difficult and in some ways far-fetched".|$|E
