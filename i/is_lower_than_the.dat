40|$|The {{depletion}} {{times of}} the anticoccidial nicarbazin administered individually and of nicarbazin and narasin administered in combination were evaluated by determining the presence and levels of 4, 4 '-dinitrocarbanilide (DNC), the marker residue for nicarbazin, and narasin residues in the muscle tissues of broiler chickens subjected to a pharmacological treatment. A high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method was used. The results showed the presence of all anticoccidial residues; however, the DNC levels were higher when the nicarbazin was administered individually than when it was used in association with narasin throughout the experimental period. After six days of withdrawal, the DNC level following nicarbazin administration alone <b>was</b> <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> maximum residue level (MRL) of 200 μg kg- 1. However, when the nicarbazin was co-administered with narasin, the concentrations of DNC <b>were</b> <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> MRL after four days of withdrawal. These results may be justified because the dosage of nicarbazin, when administrated individually, is greater than when it is used in combination with narasin. The levels of narasin <b>were</b> <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> MRL of 15 μg kg- 1 throughout the evaluation period. It was concluded that nicarbazin is rapidly metabolized from the broiler muscles up to six days of withdrawal since <b>the</b> DNC levels <b>were</b> <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> maximum residue level (MRL) and the concentrations of narasin <b>were</b> <b>lower</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> MRL throughout the evaluation period...|$|R
