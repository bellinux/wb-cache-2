5000|$|I killed. But I didn't {{just kill}} fifty, I didn't kill a hundred. I killed a thousand. I killed TEN thousand! And I {{was good at}} it. And it wasn't for vengeance, it wasn't for greed.

50|$|The Head-on Collision is an {{intervention}} aimed not at any single defense but rather {{aimed at the}} entire defensive structure being deployed by the patient. It is an urgent appeal to the patient to exert maximal effort to overcome the resistance, and it {{takes the form of}} a summary statement to the patient which explains the consequences of continuing to resist:Let's take a look at what's happening here. You have come on your own free will, because you are experiencing a problem which causes you pain. We have set out to get to the root of your difficulties, but every time we attempt to move toward it, you put up this massive wall. The wall keeps me out, and it keeps you from knowing your own true feelings. If you keep me out, you keep me useless. <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>want?</b> Because, as you see, you are certainly capable of keeping me useless to you. My first question is, why would you want me to be useless? You see, the consequences of this would be that I would be unable to help you. I'd like to, but the nature of this work is that I can't help everyone. Sometimes I fail. However, can you afford to fail? How much longer do you want to carry this burden?This complex intervention is simultaneously aimed at the patient's will, is a reminder of the task, and is a wake-up call to the therapeutic alliance to exert maximal effort against the resistance. It is a reminder, in stark terms, that the therapeutic task is in jeopardy and may well fail. Finally, it is a reminder to the patient of the consequences of failure, as well as an implied reminder that success is also possible.|$|E

[...] "I'm {{not at all}} keen about marrying--your son misrepresented me; but there's no knowing what {{an interesting}} woman might do with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Young man," [...] he said, [...] "that sum {{has been}} {{collected}} for your funds by {{the friends of}} your country abroad. Take it {{and use it as}} you think best. All that I ask from <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do, you do quickly. Let me suggest an occasion for you. The Archduke of Austria will be in your capital almost {{as soon as you can}} reach home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"All that I {{have to say}} to <b>you</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> did {{down there}} has never been seen in any other war. Never in any country in the world has such a dastardly act been {{committed}} as the shooting of one who goes to meet the white flag." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Under the streets, in the sewers, in the wires, in the telephones, {{there is}} {{something}} alive; <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean?

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Grace, [...] "I {{thought we}} might take turns to go to Miss Manners's missionary working parties.

6000|$|... "Oh, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> wanted? But why didn't {{you say so}} before? You {{would have}} spared me the trouble of {{knocking}} you down. I thought gentlemen of your profession invariably conducted these affairs with decency, decorum, and a certain grace. Had you done so, you might have saved your breeches." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Murder! Good God, Dorian, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{have come}} to? I shall not inform upon you. It {{is not my}} business.

6000|$|... "And <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{called me}} downstairs for?" [...] cried the {{proprietor}} of the restaurant, in a rage. [...] "Make me throw down a good hand at cards {{just to look at}} a lot of tin knives and forks! You peddlers are getting more bold every day. The police ought to sit down on every one of you!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... ‘Yes, I <b>am</b> certain <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> {{would have}} done. But oh, mother, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> just how Jess would have acted if some poorer woman {{than she had}} shown her a new shawl.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes--I am sure <b>you</b> do. It <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> convinces me you do. Even the {{remarkable}} and sensible explanation you gave {{of it when}} you interpreted {{the parable of the}} talents is not so powerful as the impression that you yourself believe after thinking it out for yourself--not accepting the old explanations. And then," [...] she added, with a note as of surprise, [...] "you are willing to sacrifice everything for it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] said Desmond dryly, [...] "is a fact I'm {{naturally}} quite aware of. I like a frolic now {{and then}} {{as well as most}} other men, but I've sense enough not to indulge in it when I'm out on business. The trouble <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have done you will very probably do again, and that wouldn't suit either me or Ormsgill. I'm afraid you'll have to take the boat north to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{ought to}} <b>be</b> killed, <b>that's</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> ought,' said Annie, tensely. 'You {{ought to be}} killed.' And there was a terrifying lust in her voice.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't go, Quaritch, don't go," [...] {{said the}} Squire. [...] "I shall be glad of your advice, and I <b>am</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> hear {{will not go}} any further." ...|$|R
5000|$|In A Moveable Feast, {{published}} after Hemingway's and Stein's deaths, Hemingway {{claims that}} Stein heard the phrase from a garage owner who serviced Stein's car.

60|$|A YOUNG MAN. Some dream {{when they}} are awake, {{but they are the}} crazy, and who would believe what they say?

60|$|FATHER DEMPSEY [with gentle emphasis]. I have a KNOWLEDGE of {{what the}} Roun Towers <b>were,</b> if <b>that's</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> mean. They <b>are</b> the forefingers of the early Church, {{pointing}} us all to God.|$|R

2500|$|... "A common {{assumption}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do {{to induce}} {{a sense of}} flow is purely a personal issue, and ultimately <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do doesn’t really matter. What matters is the fact of psychological flow. You’re most likely to experience flow wherever you have the skill, and you're most likely to develop skill wherever you have the aptitude, whether it’s in music, sport, hunting, meditating, etc. From the Buddha’s point of view, however, it really does matter <b>what</b> <b>you</b> do to gain gratification, for some skills are more conducive to stable, long-term happiness than others, due to their long-term consequences" ...|$|R
