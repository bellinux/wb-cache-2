40|$|M. Comm. (International Accounting) The study {{investigates the}} {{potential}} effect of applying a fair value model after the grant date to employee share options. The research assesses {{the appropriateness of}} the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment transactions with a specific focus on equity-settled Employee Share Options. The researcher has calculated the percentage movements or changes of fair value between each financial year including the overall percentage change. The study was mainly triggered by the IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment rules and various arguments from different authors challenging the appropriateness of IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment on employee share options (ESOs) transactions in capturing the full economic value transferred to the option holder at exercise date when applying a grant date accounting model. The study provides insights into whether a grant date accounting model is appropriate in measuring ESOs and capturing the full economic value transferred to the option holder. The application of a static fair value model in measuring the value of ESOs has the potential for both positive and negative effects on the compensation cost recognised in the financial statements over the vesting period. After analysing the descriptive financial data on fair value per option over the six year period included in the sample selection, a conclusion was reached that, IASB should consider to true-up or make a restatement of the opening balance of the <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> <b>reserves</b> account in order to minimise the potential permanent error in equity accounts and to minimise the potential effect of understating or overstating the compensation cost. The IASB should further consider the proper classification of equity instruments issued to employee ESOs which comply with other financial instrument accounting standards such as the IAS 32 – Financial Instruments: Presentation, and IFRS 9 Financial Instruments. This will ensure that transactions viewed as economic equivalents of each other are treated in the same way from an accounting perspective, and the correct measurement basis of ESOs may be achieved...|$|E
40|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} that, {{in the absence of}} a trading market for loss reserves, a reasonable estimate of the “fair value ” of unpaid losses is the risk-free present value of an unbiased estimate of those losses plus a market-based risk margin. If the risk margin is defined as the risk-free present value of the market-clearing cost of the capital required to support the unpaid losses during the run-off period, the size of the risk margin depends on the amount of required capital. Existing literature shows how to calculate the risk margin in cases where the amount of required capital is specified exogenously. However, the European Solvency II directive defines the capital requirement as of any given date as an endogenous variable equal to the amount needed to ensure solvency over a one-year time horizon with 99. 5 % confidence. This paper derives and illustrates an integrated framework for quantifying the required capital, the implied cost-of-capital-based risk margin and the <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> <b>reserve</b> from the expected volatility, payment and other characteristics of an unpaid loss portfolio consistent with the Solvency II standard.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} utilizes empirical {{methods to}} shed light on the current debate over whether to adopt <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting for loans held for long term. Proponents of <b>fair</b> <b>valuing</b> loans argue that reporting loans at their <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> enhances the overall transparency of financial reporting. In contrast, opponents are against applying <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting to loans because <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> cannot be measured reliably in the case of loans held for long term. Therefore, the key question here is whether loan <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> are sufficiently reliable to provide more relevant and transparent information compared to traditional measurements of loans. To explore this, I compare <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> disclosures of loans under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107 (SFAS 107), Disclosures about <b>Fair</b> <b>Value</b> of Financial Instruments, with traditional measurements of loans reported on balance sheets. More specifically, this study asks two research questions; (i) whether loan <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> provide more relevant information about future loan losses compared to traditional measurements of loans and (ii) whether banks intentionally manage their <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> estimates of loans when they are financially distressed. SFAS 107 mandates the disclosure of <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> for financial instruments with the objective of providing investors with more relevant information about firms' future cash flows. However, the results show that <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> measurements of loans explained variation in future loan losses, which capture cash flows from loans, less than traditional cost-based measurements of loans. In addition, I find evidence suggesting that financially distressed banks overstated the <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> of their loan portfolios and that <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> of loans in the aggregate lagged considerably behind the market values of loans during the recent credit crisis. Overall, my results suggest that <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> disclosures in bank loan portfolios contain relatively less information about future cash flows because they are measured unreliably and they suffer from a similar lack of timeliness as reported carrying values...|$|R

40|$|M. Comm. The {{application}} of measurement models in accountancy {{is the subject}} of debate, due to the financial crisis. In particular, it has brought renewed focus on the current use of the <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> measurement model in accounting standards, raising debates concerning whether the use of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> worsened the effects of the financial crisis. Previously, there was a strong move towards <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting especially in respect of financial instruments. As a result of the financial crisis, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), hereafter referred to as the Boards, responded to the criticism aimed at <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting. The objective of this research study is to establish whether the leading standard setters, namely the FASB and its predecessor the APB, and the IASB, and its predecessor the IASC, have established a conceptual paradigm for <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting. The literature confirms that a paradigm is established when consensus has been reached regarding the related aspect. This study therefore assesses whether the Boards have reached consensus on all aspects of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting in financial reporting. The concepts found in the Frameworks and principles found in the financial reporting standards are assessed. A qualitative research design in a critical framework is adopted for this research. The research is a critical assessment of the work of the Boards to determine whether a conceptual paradigm for <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting has been established. This critical assessment is structured into various chapters that are dedicated to a specific decade. Each chapter examines the role that the Boards played {{in the development of the}} conceptual paradigm of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting for each decade. This study found that the Boards made significant progress on the development of the <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> paradigm over the period of this study. The most significant progress on the <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> paradigm was made at a financial reporting standards level. The Boards reached consensus on the <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> definition and exit price concept. Consensus was also reached on the initial measurement of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> and on the measurement guidance for <b>fair</b> <b>value.</b> This measurement guidance was consistent and can be applied in all financial reporting standards that require <b>fair</b> <b>value.</b> The ii subsequent measurement principles established in IFRS 9 required an assessment of the business model and contractual cash flows, to determine whether <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> should be applied or not. It remains to be seen whether this principle will be accepted by the FASB and furthermore, whether this principle can be applied to other financial reporting standards that refer to <b>fair</b> <b>value.</b> The Boards reached consensus on the disclosure of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> measurements with the publication of the standards on <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> measurement, SFAS No. 157 <b>Fair</b> <b>Value</b> Measurements and IFRS 13 <b>Fair</b> <b>Value</b> Measurements. However, limited progress was made on the development of the <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> paradigm at a conceptual Framework level. The Boards have not developed a clear measurement objective or provided conceptual guidance for the <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> paradigm.

Thus, investors desire timely and transparent information about how <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> is measured, its impact on current financial statements, and its potential to impact future periods. There are numerous items for which <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> measurements are required or permitted. ASC 820 and IFRS 13 (“the <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> standards”) provide authoritative guidance on <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> measurement. The increased use of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> requires companies to refresh measurement policies and procedures. Companies should analyze how <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> is determined when no active market exists, and establish procedures to develop the appropriate disclosures. Valuation professionals may need to be involved early in the process. Appropriate and robust disclosures in the financial statements are necessary to inform investors about measurement methods and uncertainty. The increasing needs for disclosures may require the establishment new processes and databases to record and report the information.

40|$|As the {{two major}} {{accounting}} standard setters, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), are jointly advocating a full <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> disclosure regime, there have been heated discussions regarding {{the pros and cons}} of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> versus historical cost among accounting researchers, practitioners, and regulators. Current accounting research basically examines the <b>value</b> relevance of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting from a shareholder perspective (e. g., Barth, 1994; Petroni and Wahlen, 1995; Song et al., 2010). In comparison, the impact of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting on the debt market is largely under-investigated. As noted by Baker, Greenwood and Wurgler (2003, p. 262), “Relative to the literature on equity financing patterns, and relative to the actual importance of debt finance in the U. S. economy, the literature on debt financing patterns is surprisingly underdeveloped”. Hence, the interface between accounting regime and debt financing has recently emerged as a fruitful area for research. In fact, creditors, especially public debtholders, have informational and pay-off disadvantages that they seek useful accounting information to compensate for. 	The purpose of this dissertation is twofold: (1) to examine the impact of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting on the debt market; (2) to examine the influence of specialized auditors on the association between <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting and the debt market effects. The investigation focuses on U. S. bank holding companies issuing debt as they are the reporting entities most affected by the advent of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting. The first essay focuses on the relative explanatory power of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting versus historical cost in explaining credit ratings, a common proxy for firm credit quality. I consider both short-term and long-term credit ratings. Results show that <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting outperforms historical cost in explaining firm short-term credit ratings. On the contrary, I do not find evidence that <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting is a better predictor of firm long-term credit ratings. Additional tests further reveal that auditor industry expertise improves <b>fair</b> <b>value’s</b> explanatory power for short-term credit risk. The second essay concentrates on the impact of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting on banks’ cost of debt, proxied by yield spread. Results suggest that greater use of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting measurement in the financial statements is generally associated with a lower cost of debt, which supports the argument that <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting improves the decision usefulness of accounting information. Findings further show that Level 1 and Level 2 <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> inputs are related with a lower cost of debt, while Level 3 <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> inputs are associated with a higher cost of debt. In addition, evidence suggests that auditor industry expertise improves the decision usefulness of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting information, especially of Level 3 inputs, resulting in lower cost of debt. 	Overall, these results lead to the conclusion that <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting is generally decision useful, although the extent of decision usefulness of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> varies across the three tiers of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> levels. Besides, the existence of industry specialized auditors improves the decision usefulness of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting to debtholders. However, cautions are advised with regard to the implications based on the empirical results, due to the limitations of the methodologies used in this dissertation.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> {{reporting}} and its attributes on audit fees. We use as our primary sample the European real estate industry around mandatory IFRS adoption (under which reporting of property <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> becomes compulsory), due to its unique operating and reporting characteristics. We document lower audit fees for firms reporting property assets at <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> relative to those employing depreciated cost—a difference that appears driven, in part, by impairment tests that occur only under depreciated cost. We further find that audit fees are decreasing in firms’ exposure to <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> and increasing both in {{the complexity of the}} <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> estimation and for recognition (versus only disclosure) of <b>fair</b> <b>values.</b> We corroborate our findings in two alternative settings: contrasting UK and US real estate firms and using UK investment trusts. Overall, the results suggest that <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> can lead to lower monitoring costs; however, any reductions in audit fees will vary with salient characteristics of the <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> reporting, including the difficulty to measure and the treatment within the financial statements...|$|R

In this regard, the key question - is <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> relevant ? - can be analysed as follows : do <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> « accounting numbers » provide a better estimate {{of the value of}} a company and the risk relating to its activity ? How informative are they for users ? How useful is <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> information for decision-making ? In order to answer these questions, the author examines first the basis and limitations of the traditional accounting model. He analyses then the determining factors in the emergence of the <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> method, with particular regard to the role attributed to financial statements and the needs of their users. Lastly, he presents a summary of the empirical studies carried out to assess the usefulness of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting information. JEL classifications : G 14, M 41 Casta Jean-François.
