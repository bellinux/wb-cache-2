He may have {{intellectual}} knowledge gleaned from a book, {{but he has no}} immediate insight into the muscles of his particular arm. The body schema lacks that level of mechanistic detail.|$|R

50|$|To give {{weight in}} {{figures such as}} an allemande, rollaway or swing, lean {{slightly}} away from your partner and maintain a distinct resistance <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>arm,</b> hand and fingers; don't squeeze, but don't let <b>your</b> <b>arms</b> go limp or fully extended, either. This helps you and <b>your</b> partner move <b>in</b> unison. It also allows such figures to be done faster and with extra flair, and may enhance the sense of dancing with the other person and not just near him or her. Weight can also {{be thought of as}} springiness or tension.|$|R

2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1965, Berry Gordy was {{scouting}} to get {{the group}} signed to his fabled Motown Records label. Though the three Pips wanted to sign with the label, Gladys Knight initially refused, due to her fears that the label would overlook them over the more popular artists on his roster. They would sign with Motown in 1966, being assigned to Motown's Soul Records label, a label which featured acts who had more of an R flavor than a pop flavor. Their first Motown single, [...] "Just Walk in My Shoes", was a hit in England, but the group was disappointed in having The Andantes sing over the Pips in the song, resulting in the group demanding that the Andantes not be featured on the group's recordings.
