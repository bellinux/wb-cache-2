40|$|The {{operation}} of a helicopter with an externally slung load is highly demanding for the flight crew. Without having a direct view on the load, the pilot needs assistance by a crew member for load handling, e. g. load positioning. During <b>Helicopter</b> <b>Hoist</b> <b>Operations</b> (HHO), the hoist operator gives instructions to the pilot and stabilizes the load motion. An automatic load positioning system for HHO is designed with the aim to reduce the workload of the flight crew and to improve the load handling performance. The control system consists of a multi-loop architecture that is designed using multi-objective optimization. The system was designed to achieve best performance in load positioning for the entire cable length range of the rescue hoist. Load positioning performance {{is a function of}} the cable length; faster automatic load positioning can be achieved with shorter cable lengths. This paper describes the overall design process covering the tools, control law architecture, optimization, and the validation using DLR’s simulator...|$|E

40|$|Mine {{hoisting}} is {{the most}} critical and potentially the most dangerous operation in underground mining. Many hazards are related to falls of miners and materials, ground instability, and malfunction or lack of safety devices. All {{have the potential to}} cause a catastrophic accident. A condition know as 'slack rope' is particularly dangerous, especially if it occurs without the operator's awareness. The most common occurrence of slack rope is in metal or nonmetal mines that have a history of ground control problems near the shaft. Studies of hoist safety features and Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) accident statistics suggests a need to measure wire rope tension, conveyance speed and position, and shaft guide misalignment. The most accurate data are obtained directly from the conveyance.

40|$|Offshore {{design and}} {{construction}} {{is much more difficult}} than land-based {{design and construction}}, particularly due to <b>hoisting</b> <b>operations.</b> Real-time monitoring of the orientation and movement of a hoisted structure is thus required for operators’ safety. In recent years, rapid development of the smart-phone commercial market has offered the possibility that everyone can carry a mini personal computer that is integrated with sensors, an operating system and communication system that can act as an effective aid for cyber-physical systems (CPS) research. In this paper, a CPS for hoisting monitoring using smartphones was proposed, including a phone collector, a controller and a server. This system uses smartphones equipped with internal sensors to obtain girder movement information, which will be uploaded to a server, then returned to controller users. An alarming system will be provided on the controller phone once the returned data exceeds a threshold. The proposed monitoring system is used to monitor the movement and orientation of a girder during hoisting on a cross-sea bridge in real time. The results show the convenience and feasibility of the proposed system...|$|R
40|$|The Handling Qualities (HQs) of a {{helicopter}} can be adversely affected through {{the presence of an}} externally slung load. Helicopter stability margins may be reduced, due to the additional dynamics of the load system, which can subsequently increase pilot workload, and reduce the operational envelope. An Automatic Load Damping System (ALDS) has been designed and has been successfully tested in flight. This system, alongside slung load scenarios, has been implemented within a piloted simulation in DLR’s Air Vehicle Simulator. In this article, the results from a simulated test campaign to observe the influence of the stabilization system on the vehicle HQs are presented. The system is assessed using three Mission Task Elements, modified for <b>hoist</b> <b>operations.</b> Results show that a conflict between pilot control and commanded inputs from the ALDS can cause unstable slung load oscillations and degradation in HQs in hover. However, it is shown that when the stabilization system is used only when required, both the HQs of the helicopter are conserved, and load oscillations are reduced. The results in this paper are intended to motivate future flight tests using DLR’s Active Control Technology/Flying Helicopter Simulator...|$|R

40|$|A {{questionnaire}} on patient hoists was circulated to all 220 qualified nurses {{working in}} a geriatric department. A survey of the provision and state of repair of the hoists was carried out on the unit. Despite being aware {{of the value of}} hoists, 41 % of the 134 nurses who responded to the questionnaire never or rarely used them. An important reason for this was inadequate instruction in hoist use, 65 % of nurses feeling that their instruction had been inadequate.

40|$|This {{research}} {{is based on}} the mathematical analysis of the speed control of the Hoist Motor installed in the Transtainer, Sri Lanka Ports Authority. The Transtainer is a crane used for the handling of containers and the Hoist Motor installed in the transtainer is used for the lifting and lowering of the containers from the container vessel to the container yard or vice versa. This analysis has been done for the <b>hoist</b> <b>operation</b> of the transtainer. The hoisting speed is started from the zero speed and reached to a steady speed after the acceleration is finished and finally, it is reached to the zero speed again. This complete cycle is known as the <b>hoist</b> <b>operation.</b> A separately excited DC motor is used for the Hoist Motor to lift a container load. The operator of the transtainer uses the joystick controller having five notch positions to control the speed of the hoist motor and when the operator uses the joystick controller from zero to fourth notch, the speed varies from zero up to the base speed and when the joystick controller is put from fourth notch position to fifth notch position, the speed of the motor is varied from the base speed to the final steady state speed which is higher than the base speed. This final speed depends on the container load which is lifted by thehoist motor. The Hoist Motor speed is controlled from zero up to the base speed by changing the armature voltage of the motor and the motor speed is controlled from base speed up to the final speed by changing the motor field current. The armature voltage of the hoist motor is controlled by changing the DC generator out put voltage which is directly supplied to the hoist motorThe Hoist Motor speed is controlled from zero up to the base speed by changing the armature voltage of the motor and the motor speed is controlled from base speed up to the final speed by changing the motor field current. The armature voltage of the hoist motor is controlled by changing the DC generator out put voltage which is directly supplied to the hoist motor. The out put voltage of the DC generator is controlled by changing the generator field current which is controlled by the firing signals of the thyristors. Firing signals of the thyristios are controlled by the speed controller mainly consisting of Automatic Speed Regulator (ASR) and Automatic Current Regulator (ACR). The speed reference signal produced by the joystick controller in the crane is given to the speed controller via a soft starter and this speed reference input to the speed controller is a ramp signal. In addition to the speed reference input, the armature current feedback and the motor speed feed back are given to the speed controller to control the motor speedIn this research, two mathematical models were made to analyse the motor armature voltage control and the motor field control and the both transient and steady state analysis of the hoist motor speed have been done in addition to the stability analysis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: During normal operation, {{the ends}} of <b>helicopter</b> rescue <b>hoist</b> ropes, to which a hook is attached, can be subject to bending stress caused by vibrations. This happens {{in the event of}} partial or total {{recovery}} of the hook into its lodging without a spring-loaded blocking system. The swinging of the rope end consequently causes bending of the rope near the terminal, with resultant fatigue stress that can lead quickly to breakage or damage of the rope. A series of alternating bending fatigue tests using a constant load, similar to those known as BoS (bending over sheave) tests, were carried out. These simulate the effective working conditions of a rescue hoist.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the number of {{offshore}} wind farms is rapidly increasing. Especially coastal European countries are building numerous offshore wind turbines in the Baltic, the North, and the Irish Sea. During both construction and operation of these wind farms, many specially-equipped helicopters are on duty. Due to their flexibility, their hover capability, and their higher speed compared to ships, these aircraft perform important tasks like helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) as well as passenger and freight transfer flights. The missions often include specific challenges like ship landings or <b>hoist</b> <b>operations</b> to drop off workers onto wind turbines. However, adverse weather conditions frequently limit offshore helicopter operations. In such scenarios, the adoption of aircraft-mounted sensors and obstacle databases together with helmet-mounted displays (HMD) seems to offer great potential to improve the operational capabilities of the helicopters used. By displaying environmental information in a visual conformal manner, these systems mitigate the loss of visual reference to the environment. This helps the pilots to maintain proper situational awareness (SA). This paper presents how our previously introduced concept of an HMD-based virtual flight deck can enhance offshore helicopter missions. The advantages of this system – for instance its “see-through the airframe”-capability and its highly-flexible cockpit instrument setup – enable us to design entirely novel pilot assistance systems. The work analyzes the specific requirements on our virtual cockpit so as to assist the helicopter crew in offshore-specific tasks. The gained knowledge is used to propose and evaluate concepts for a virtual cockpit that is tailor-made for helicopter offshore maneuvers...|$|R
