2500|$|In March 2001, Aurora was sailing {{through the}} Taiwan Strait {{on her first}} world cruise when she was called to assist Pamela Dream, a Cambodian {{registered}} ship crewed by Russian officers and crew which had capsized in rough seas. Aurora launched her <b>fast</b> <b>rescue</b> <b>boats</b> to retrieve survivors from the water. The crew were able to retrieve three survivors. A crewmember described the sea state as [...] "very rough, with waves of about [...] ". One of Auroras propellers was damaged by flotsam, an inspection of the propeller {{was carried out in}} Singapore where it was polished by divers. The damaged propeller was eventually replaced in dry dock in Southampton in December 2002.|$|E

5000|$|Push for <b>faster</b> <b>rescue</b> boats: Ever since {{a tragic}} April 2015 {{accident}} that claimed {{the lives of}} two children in the Port of LA, Councilman Buscaino has been vocal about the need for <b>faster</b> <b>rescue</b> <b>boats.</b> The Councilman continues to advocate for the purchase of new, faster response boats, a change that could potentially save lives. The current response boat for the Port of LA is Fireboat 2, which was acquired by the city Fire Department in 2003; Fireboat 2 is the largest boat of its kind west of the Mississippi, but with that size comes a tradeoff of speed. The addition of smaller, <b>faster</b> <b>rescue</b> <b>boats</b> could resolve that problem.|$|R

5000|$|Atlantic College was {{instrumental}} in the design and development of the RNLI's first <b>fast</b> <b>rescue</b> <b>boats</b> {{under the supervision of the}} headmaster, Rear Admiral Desmond Hoare. He was the pioneer of the Rigid Inflatable Boat (RIB) and of the first [...] lifeboat which was named after the college and entered service in the 1970s. In the early 1960s the college had designed a rigid inflatable boat which subsequently became the basis for the B-class. The college sold the patent to the RNLI for £1 in 1973. An early example was discovered in Barry in 2012 and restored in 2014.|$|E

50|$|A MOB, {{short for}} Man Overboard Boat, is a small, <b>fast</b> <b>rescue</b> <b>boat</b> which large vessels, {{especially}} passenger ferries and cruise ships, use for man overboard situations. A MOB often has a RIB or similar hull to achieve great speed with stability. Both outboard engines and inboard pump-jet propulsion are used on MOB's.

50|$|Assigned to the 1st Naval District in {{northern}} New England, Itty E operated successfully as a <b>fast</b> <b>rescue</b> <b>boat</b> at Naval Air Station Boston, Massachusetts. She {{was transferred to}} Norfolk, Virginia, on 20 October 1917, but saw little service there because of a need for extensive engine repairs. Her engine had been removed and was under repair in a facility ashore when it was burned in July 1918, resulting in Itty E being declared a constructive total loss. She {{was taken to the}} Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C., in October 1918 and scrapped there in 1920.|$|R

50|$|The RNLI {{started to}} provide small, <b>fast</b> inshore <b>rescue</b> <b>boats</b> in the 1960s, {{but it was}} not until August 1996 that one was {{stationed}} at Fowey. The harbour at Mevagissey had been considered as a possible ILB station but no suitable site could be found. The small D Class inflatable was initially kept in a wooden container at Berrill's Yard and launched using a davit near the AWB's moorings which had recently been moved from Town Quay. On 4 October 1997 a unique triple ceremony took place at Fowey to bring into service not just a new purpose-built lifeboat station Berrill's Yard at but also to christen the station's two newest lifeboats, Trent Class AWB Maurice and Joyce Hardy (ON 1222) and D Class IRB Olive Herbert.|$|R

The CCG inshore <b>rescue</b> <b>boats</b> hired university students to serve as crew, {{in part due to}} the success of the student crews operating these ever-buoyant rescue craft at Atlantic and at Pearson College.|$|R

50|$|The International Maritime Organisation, London amended SOLAS (Safety of Life at Sea) {{regulations}} with {{effect from}} 1st July 1986 with far reaching consequences as it introduced new rules for use of Lifeboats on ships particularly Oil and Gas Carriers etc., which {{proved to be a}} turning point. Successfully indigenously designed and manufactured the 8 mtr 50 Persons capacity FRP Totally Enclosed Fire Protected Lifeboat after conducting all the prototype tests including the most severe fire test in the very first attempt achieved by only a few Lifeboat builders globally. For this purpose, the Lifeboat was placed in a specially erected concrete tank located in the outskirts of Chennai with no human habitation, filled with 3,400 ltrs of kerosene and petrol and burned for a continuous period of 14 minutes with a couple of mice kept inside the boat (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVW6ahdg7A8).
