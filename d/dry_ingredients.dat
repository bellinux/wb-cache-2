25|$|A major {{advance in}} {{manufacturing}} began in Europe {{in the late}} 14th century when the safety and thoroughness of incorporation was improved by wet grinding; liquid, such as distilled spirits or perhaps the urine of wine-drinking bishops was added during the grinding-together of the ingredients and the moist paste dried afterwards.

The lexicon was initially identified {{from a large}} sample set of <b>dried</b> dairy <b>ingredients</b> (138).

50|$|If {{a recipe}} {{calls for a}} level {{teaspoon}} of a <b>dry</b> <b>ingredient</b> (salt, flour, etc.), this refers to an approximately leveled filling of the spoon, producing the same volume as for liquids. A rounded teaspoon is a larger but less precise measure, produced without leveling the ingredient off or heaping it as high as possible. A heaping or heaped teaspoon is a larger inexact measure consisting of the amount obtained by scooping the <b>dry</b> <b>ingredient</b> up without leveling it off. For some ingredients, e.g. flour, this quantity can vary considerably.|$|R

25|$|Hydraulic cements (e.g., Portland cement) set {{and become}} {{adhesive}} {{due to a}} chemical reaction between the <b>dry</b> <b>ingredients</b> and water. The chemical reaction results in mineral hydrates that are not very water-soluble and so are quite durable in water and safe from chemical attack. This allows setting in wet condition or underwater and further protects the hardened material from chemical attack. The chemical process for hydraulic cement found by ancient Romans used volcanic ash (pozzolana) with added lime (calcium oxide).|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{sea fennel}} (Crithmum maritimum L.) is a wild plant {{from the same}} family of the parsley and celery, that {{is used as a}} fresh {{ingredient}} for many food preparations. In this work, some alternative culinary uses for this aromatic plant as a <b>dried</b> <b>ingredient</b> have been proposed. Therefore, two drying technologies were applied with the aim to obtain a new spice-colorant without chemical synthesis. The results are discussed in terms of visual quality, odor and taste of the dehydrated products. Moreover, the effects on the overall sensory properties of some dishes prepared using the two different types of this new spice are reported. The introduction of the dried sea fennel in gastronomy could increase the sensory appeal of some traditional dishes and support the creation of many new recipes...|$|R
