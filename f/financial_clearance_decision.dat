40|$|This report {{discusses}} the methodology, formulas, and inputs {{needed to make}} characterization and <b>clearance</b> <b>decisions</b> for Bacillus anthracis-contaminated and uncontaminated (or decontaminated) areas using a statistical sampling approach. Specifically, the report includes the methods and formulas for calculating the • number of samples required to achieve a specified confidence in characterization and <b>clearance</b> <b>decisions</b> • confidence in making characterization and <b>clearance</b> <b>decisions</b> for a specified number of samples for two common statistically based environmental sampling approaches. In particular, the report addresses an issue raised by the Government Accountability Office by providing methods and formulas to calculate the confidence that a decision area is uncontaminated (or successfully decontaminated) if all samples collected according to a statistical sampling approach have negative results. Key to addressing this topic is the probability that an individual sample result is a false negative, which is {{commonly referred to as}} the false negative rate (FNR). The two statistical sampling approaches currently discussed in this report are 1) hotspot sampling to detect small isolated contaminated locations during the characterization phase, and 2) combined judgment and random (CJR) sampling during the clearance phase. Typically if contamination is widely distributed in a decision area, it will be detectable via judgment sampling during the characterization phrase. Hotspot sampling is appropriate for characterization situations where contamination is not widely distributed and may not be detected by judgment sampling. CJR sampling is appropriate during the clearance phase when it is desired to augment judgment samples with statistical (random) samples. The hotspot and CJR statistical sampling approaches are discussed in the report for four situations: 1. qualitative data (detect and non-detect) when the FNR = 0 or when using statistical sampling methods that account for FNR > 0 2. qualitative data when the FNR > 0 but statistical sampling methods are used that assume the FNR = 0 3. quantitative data (e. g., contaminant concentrations expressed as CFU/cm 2) when the FNR = 0 or when using statistical sampling methods that account for FNR > 0 4. quantitative data when the FNR > 0 but statistical sampling methods are used that assume the FNR = 0. For Situation 2, the hotspot sampling approach provides for stating with Z% confidence that a hotspot of specified shape and size with detectable contamination will be found. Also for Situation 2, the CJR approach provides for stating with X% confidence that at least Y% of the decision area does not contain detectable contamination. Forms of these statements for the other three situations are discussed in Section 2. 2. Statistical methods that account for FNR > 0 currently only exist for the hotspot sampling approach with qualitative data (or quantitative data converted to qualitative data). This report documents the current status of methods and formulas for the hotspot and CJR sampling approaches. Limitations of these methods are identified. Extensions of the methods that are applicable when FNR = 0 to account for FNR > 0, or to address other limitations, will be documented in future revisions of this report if future funding supports the development of such extensions. For quantitative data, this report also presents statistical methods and formulas for 1. quantifying the uncertainty in measured sample results 2. estimating the true surface concentration corresponding to a surface sample 3. quantifying the uncertainty of the estimate of the true surface concentration. All of the methods and formulas discussed in the report were applied to example situations to illustrate application of the methods and interpretation of the results...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: There {{is a need}} to {{evaluate}} the influence of risk factors such as patency of foramen ovale (PFO) or "daredevil" psychological profile on contra-indication policy after a decompression sickness (DCS). Methods: By crossing information obtained from Belgian Hyperbaric Centers, DAN Emergency Hotline, the press, and Internet diving forums, it was possible to be accountable for the majority if not all DCS, which have occurred in Belgium from January 1993 to June 2013. From the available 594 records we excluded all cases with tentative diagnosis, medullary DCS or unreliability of reported dive profile, leaving 209 divers records with cerebral DCS for analysis. Demographics, dive parameters, and PFO grading were recorded. Twenty-three injured divers were tested using the Zuckerman's Sensation Seeking Scale V and compared to a matched group not involved in risky activities. Results: 41. 2 % of all injured came for iterative DCS. The average depth significantly increases with previous occurrences of DCS (1 st DCS: 31. 8 ± 7. 9 mfw; 2 nd DCS: 35. 5 ± 9. 8 mfw; 3 rd DCS: 43. 4 ± 6. 1 mfw). There is also an increase of PFO prevalence among multiple injured divers (1 st DCS: 66. 4 % 2 nd & 3 rd DCS: 100 %) with a significant increase in PFO grade. Multiple-times injured significantly scored higher than control group on thrill and adventure seeking (TAS), experience seeking, boredom susceptibility and total score. Conclusion: There is an inability of injured diver to adopt conservative dive profile after a DCS. Further work is needed to ascertain whether selected personality characteristics or PFO should be taken into account in the <b>clearance</b> <b>decision</b> to resume diving.

40|$|Recovery of spores from {{environmental}} surfaces {{is known to}} vary due to sampling methodology, techniques, spore size and characteristics, surface materials, and environmental conditions. A series of tests were performed to evaluate a new, validated sponge-wipe method. Specific factors evaluated were the effects of contaminant concentrations and surface materials on recovery efficiency (RE), false negative rate (FNR), limit of detection (LOD) - and the uncertainties of these quantities. Ceramic tile and stainless steel had the highest mean RE values (48. 9 and 48. 1 %, respectively). Faux leather, vinyl tile, and painted wood had mean RE values of 30. 3, 25. 6, and 25. 5, respectively, while plastic had the lowest mean RE (9. 8 %). Results show a roughly linear dependence of surface roughness on RE, where the smoothest surfaces have the highest mean RE values. REs were not influenced by the low spore concentrations tested (3 x 10 {sup - 3 } to 1. 86 CFU/cm{sup 2 }). The FNR data were consistent with RE data, showing a trend of smoother surfaces resulting in higher REs and lower FNRs. Stainless steel generally had the lowest mean FNR (0. 123) and plastic had the highest mean FNR (0. 479). The LOD{sub 90 } varied with surface material, from 0. 015 CFU/cm{sup 2 } on stainless steel up to 0. 039 on plastic. Selecting sampling locations {{on the basis of}} surface roughness and using roughness to interpret spore recovery data can improve sampling. Further, FNR values, calculated as a function of concentration and surface material, can be used pre-sampling to calculate the numbers of samples for statistical sampling plans with desired performance, and post-sampling to calculate the confidence in characterization and <b>clearance</b> <b>decisions...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the fall}} of 2013 the European Commission cleared two mergers, Nynas/Shell/Harburg Refinery and Aegean/Olympic II, {{on the basis of}} the failing firm defence. Since the European Commission had only twice before {{accepted}} a concentration on the basis of this defence these clearances raised the question whether the Commission’s interpretation of the failing firm defence had become more lenient. Such a change of practice would have been welcomed both by those who believed that the Commission’s failing firm doctrine was too demanding for merging parties to live up to and by European companies that were experiencing financial difficulties in the midst of the economic crisis. However, the European Commission has repeatedly stated that it cannot relax its application of EU merger control rules and that social concerns such as employment should be tackled by instruments designed specifically for them. This thesis assesses the development of the failing firm doctrine of the European Commission. The aim is to clarify how the Commission has reviewed failing firm arguments invoked by the merging parties and whether the decisions adopted during the recent economic crisis have affected this assessment. The thesis has a doctrinal standpoint as it attempts to explain how the European Commission has been and now is applying the failing firm defence. The failing firm defence is invoked when a concentration has anti-competitive effects but one of the parties to the transaction is in financial ruins and would be forced to exit the market without the merger. Competition authorities accept such arguments only when they assess that the merger is more favourable than the exit of the failing company and its assets from the market. It is argued here, that the European Commission has been fairly consistent with its application of the failing firm defence. Ever since clearing a concentration for the first time {{on the basis of the}} defence in Kali and Salz the Commission has insisted that the defence can be accepted only if the concentration in question is not causing the deterioration of the competitive structure. The purpose of the failing firm criteria it has established is to assist in the assessment of this causality. However, the 2013 <b>clearance</b> <b>decisions</b> seem to have changed the way in which the failing division defence, where only a business branch or a subsidiary of a financially healthy parent company is failing, is assessed in EU merger control. According to the Commission’s initial approach such a transaction could not take place only due to unfulfilled expectations of the parent company. However, both in Nynas/Shell/Harburg Refinery and Aegean/Olympic II the Commission assessed the strategic interests of the parent companies to continue funding their subsidiaries, which it had not done in its previous decisions. The thesis also has a theoretical aspect to it. Competition law has an inherent law and economics approach which is followed here as a series of economic theories concerning merger control is introduced. These theories serve a purpose in educating the reader about the basic concepts relating to the appraisal of failing firm arguments. However, they are also used here for assessing how the European Commission’s failing firm doctrine has developed. It is argued here that the acceptance of the defence in Kali and Salz and in BASF/Eurodiol/Pantochim is compatible with the theory of contestable markets as the clearances were followed by de facto monopoly market structures. Similarly in the 2013 <b>clearance</b> <b>decisions</b> the Commission seems to have taken due notice of the theory as the parent companies were allowed to exit unprofitable markets. However, the Commission has not relied on such reasoning every time it has faced failing firm arguments as its initial approach towards failing division arguments illustrates. Instead it can be argued that both the Commission’s failing firm doctrine as well as EU merger control on a more general level have been and still are influenced by a variety of partly contradicting economic theories...|$|R

This dissertation 2 ̆ 7 s main purpose is to study the variation found in broadcasters 2 ̆ 7 willingness to air alcoholic beverage commercials and to test different explanatory models for the divergence of reactions to these controversial products. In December 1997, 191 radio station general managers completed a mailed survey about their policy on alcohol advertising and specifically answered questions about what types of alcohol beverage ads they had accepted or would accept. Some would take all. The vast majority reported that they would accept such fermented alcohol products as beer and wine, but not for distilled liquor products. Others indicated that their stations refused all alcoholic beverage advertisements and would even refuse to air ads for nightclubs. An index of willingness to air alcoholic beverages and related products became the main dependent variable for the study. An analysis of the research literature suggested ethical, economic and audience factors would best account for the observed variation in station managers 2 ̆ 7 alcohol <b>clearance</b> <b>decisions.</b> Each factor was explored using statistical analysis. Stations with a religious format were unlikely to air commercials for alcohol products as were stations {{with a history of}} format stability. Younger general managers with a business-oriented educational background were the most likely to accept advertisements for alcohol-related products and businesses. However, the most powerful variable in explaining the differences in clearance of these controversial advertisements was found to be the ethical values of the manager, including his or her concern for the audience. Remarkably, the station 2 ̆ 7 s economic and technical conditions did not have much predictive value. No strong evidence was found for a hypothesis that alcoholic beverage advertisements are price discriminated against by stations; that is, these advertisers are charged a higher price by stations because of controversial content. ...|$|R
5000|$|CRI in {{particular}} offers especially broad protection to service members and {{employees of the}} Defense Intelligence Community through the Defense Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Program because CRI is the lead federal investigative entity reviewing security clearance decision-making as a pretext for reprisal. This is done under the Inspector General’s authority, and not through an application of the Whistleblower Protection Act. Section 2302 of title 5 lists twelve distinct prohibited personnel practices that, when following a disclosure of wrongdoing, may constitute a whistleblower reprisal. Severe actions such as termination, reassignment, or demotion are included among these title 5-defined adverse actions; however, security clearance decision-making and other adverse personnel security decisions {{are not covered by}} the Whistleblower Protection Act. Since intelligence and counterintelligence employment is absolutely contingent upon gaining and maintaining a security clearance, review of security clearance decision-making used as a pretext for reprisal is necessary in the protection of Defense Intelligence Community whistleblowers. For this reason, CRI investigates reprisal allegations regarding security determinations through the IG Act, which is not limited by [...] exemptions for intelligence and counterintelligence agencies. Accordingly, a revocation of a security clearance is reviewable as a pretext for reprisal. In its reports of investigation reviewing security <b>clearance</b> <b>decisions,</b> CRI classifies a negative action taken by a responsible management official as a “unfavorable personnel security determination” (USPD) and then applies title 5 standards to its review. In addition to the actions included under the definition of a UPSD, CRI also investigates suspension of security clearances as well as recommendations to an agency’s central adjudication facility to revoke, deny, or suspend security clearances as possible unfavorable personnel security determinations. While not actionable in and of themselves, suspensions and recommendations to a CAF are examined by CRI because they may constitute contributing pretexts to reprisal through security determination. By identifying these measures as actionable unfavorable personnel security determinations, CRI is able to provide broad protection to whistleblowers within the DoD intelligence community.|$|R
5000|$|Despite the {{quantitative}} lean of modern sociology; Kilburn, Costanza, Borgeson and Metchik (2011) {{point out that}} there are several methodological barbs to effectively and scientifically assessing the effect of Homeland Security measures. [...] In traditional criminology, the most quantitatively amenable starting point for measuring the effectiveness of any policing strategy (i.e.: Neighborhood Watch, Gun Abatement, Foot Patrols, etc.) is to assess total <b>financial</b> costs against <b>clearance</b> rates or arrest rates. Since terrorism is such a rare event phenomena, measuring arrests would be a naive way to test policy effectiveness.|$|R
40|$|Firms {{that sell}} very short life cycle {{products}} often receive quantity discounts from their suppliers and transporters for placing larger orders. Practitioners and researchers {{have begun to}} recognize the need to decide {{the end of the}} season markdowns by studying the sales pattern. The use of these options can affect supply chain mismatch risks and costs. In this paper, we study the impact of quantity discounts and transportation cost structures on procurement, shipment and <b>clearance</b> pricing <b>decisions</b> through a stochastic programming with recourse formulation. We propose a solution procedure that efficiently solves this stochastic non-linear problem. Our computational experiments suggest that it is not always necessary to select the most complex action plan. Under some business environments, the conventional strategy of placing and transporting a single large order is a better option. We then identify situations where options such as markdowns and the use of quick response suppliers could be useful. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|The Office of Inspector General (OIG) has the {{authority}} to investigate adverse security <b>clearance</b> and access <b>decisions</b> as part of its broad responsibility for investigating allegations that individuals suffered reprisal for making disclosures of fraud, waste and abuse to certain authorities. These responsibilities derive from both the Inspector General Act of 1978 and various statutory provisions applicable to specific classes of individuals. These laws were enacted and amended various times since 1978, and while similar in many respects they are not uniform in the protections they afford. However, they do provide a quilt of legislative provisions organized by the status of individual alleging they were reprised against {{as a result of their}} protected activity.|$|R

Another methodological problem in assessing counter-terrorism efforts in law enforcement hinges on finding operational measures for key concepts {{in the study of}} homeland security.

40|$|On 13 July 2006, the European Court of First Instance (CFI) annulled the European Commission’s {{approval}} of the merger between the music units of Sony and Bertelsmann. In its Impala ruling, the CFI severely criticized the 2004 Commission decision because it found that the evidence relied upon by the Commission was not capable of substantiating its conclusion that the Sony BMG joint venture would not create or strengthen a collective dominant position. This judgment is highly significant {{for at least two}} reasons. First of all, it has potential implications for the future shape of the music industry, since the already completed concentration, which reduced the major players from five to four, is now being re-examined by the Commission. Secondly, and more importantly, the CFI judgment raises fundamental questions about the standard of proof incumbent on the European Commission when dealing with merger cases. After the CFI’s annulment of three prohibition decisions in 2002 (Airtours, Schneider Electric and Tetra Laval), the Sony BMG decision could in fact be seen as an attempt by the Commission {{to take into account the}} high burden of proof imposed on it by the Community Courts. The fact that this decision was annulled for not meeting the requisite legal standard for authorizing a merger, is therefore both ironic and challenging because it puts the Commission on a knife-edge. This paper will address this issue by assessing (1) to what extent the Impala judgment has actually raised the standard of proof incumbent on the Commission and, subsequently, (2) whether or not Impala - seen together with other recent jurisprudence concerning the required standard of proof in merger control - is imposing a too heavy burden on the Commission. Or, to put it more colloquially, this paper will seek to find out whether or not the CFI is imposing a too high standard of proof that the Commission, due to lack of the necessary resources, perhaps cannot meet. First, the concept of collective dominance will be explained and an overview will be given of the case law on the assessment of collective dominant positions in EC merger control. Second, the Commission’s 2004 <b>clearance</b> <b>decision</b> will be discussed. Where relevant, references will be made to previous merger cases in the music industry. Third, the Impala judgment will be summarized. Fourth, the judgment will be analyzed, and this in light of the recent jurisprudence of the Community Courts concerning the standard of proof incumbent on the Commission. On the basis of these findings, an answer to the two research questions will be formulated...|$|R
