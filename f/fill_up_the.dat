5|$|Built by {{construction}} firm Turner Construction Company, the US$165 million Murano {{was completed}} in 2008 with residents first moving in on June 18. The building was completed with seventy percent of its units sold. As of December 31, 2008, sales on 111 units had been closed and an additional 14 units were under contract of sale. In 2008 and 2009 the late-2000s recession hurt the condominium market, with citywide sales declining 64 percent and high-end condo sales declining 24 percent. Analysts believed the Murano was overpriced based on the neighborhood, with potential buyers unwilling {{to take a chance}} on the developing West Market Street neighborhood during a recession. In 2009, Thomas Properties Group was looking to quickly <b>fill</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> tower to help pay for condo fees and maintenance costs. On June 27, Thomas Properties Group auctioned off 40 units in the tower. The 40 units went for between US$335,000 and US$796,000, priced at nearly 20 percent less than the units sold before the auction. Thomas Properties Group priced the 137 remaining unsold units according to what similar units went for during the auction.|$|E
5|$|In September, SAS {{announced}} that if Braathens {{took the first}} step to reduce capacity between Bergen and Oslo, they would follow immediately to reduce the overcapacity in the combined 37 daily departures. However, Braathens was not willing to reduce. On 15 September, Color Air {{announced that}} they would start flying five round trips from Oslo to Stavanger Airport, Sola on 1 October, following the delivery of their fourth aircraft. At the same time, the airline would reduce the number of round trips to Ålesund from four to two. The load factor in August was 43%, and management stated that 50% load would not be sufficient to make money. In particular, the company stated that while aircraft were full during the weekends, the company was not succeeding at garnering the necessary business ridership to <b>fill</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> planes during the weekdays. To become more attractive, the company changed its fares to two classes: Business Full Flex and Saver No Flex. The company also stated that to attract more business travelers, it was looking for an international partner to conduct codesharing on international routes, and perhaps also introduce a frequent flyer program alone or in cooperation with the partner.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian Competition Authority {{announced}} {{that since the}} new company would have all domestic scheduled services between primary airports, {{it was unlikely that}} the take-over would receive permission from them. However, it was stated that one solution could be that the companies discontinue their frequent flyer programs. On 20 August, the Competition Authority declared that SAS was not allowed to purchase Braathens; the ruling was appealed by SAS and Braathens. Analysts stated that Braathens could be bankrupt by the time the appeal was processed. The Competition Authority stated that their denial of the take-over was that the reduction of capacity would remove the airline's incentive to provide discounted tickets, because they would not have to use them to capture travelers with lower willingness to pay from the competitor, and that they would not need low-paying customers to <b>fill</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> vacant seats. Instead, the authority wanted the politicians to reduce the taxes on flights. While Braathens also was opposed to the tax, they felt that removing it then was too late to save the company.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Mario is {{a falling}} block tile-matching video {{game in which}} Mario assumes {{the role of a}} doctor, tossing two-colored medical {{capsules}} into a medicine bottle representing the playing field. This area is populated by viruses of three colors: red, yellow, and blue, which stay in their starting position until removed. In a manner and style considered similar to Tetris, the player manipulates each capsule as it vertically falls 1 unit of space at a time, able to move it left or right and rotate it 90 degrees in either clockwise or counter-clockwise. When four or more capsule halves or viruses of matching color are aligned in vertical or horizontal configurations, they are removed from play. Any remaining capsule halves or whole capsules which are now not supported by a virus or capsule will fall {{to the bottom of the}} playing field or until it hits another supported object, and any new 4-in-a-row alignments created from this will also be removed. The main objective is to complete levels, which is accomplished by eliminating all viruses from the playing field. A game over occurs if capsules <b>fill</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> playing field in a way that obstructs the bottle's narrow neck. After each 5th level is completed on Medium or High difficulty, up to level 20, a cut-scene is shown where the virus trio is sitting on a tree as music plays and an object flies across the screen.|$|E

Operations commenced on 25 April with five weekly flights to London and two weekly flights each to Barcelona, Berlin, Dubrovnic, Nice, Parma, Paris and Palma de Mallorca.|$|E
25|$|The branch was {{estimated}} to cost 226,000 Norwegian speciedaler.

Some of the games involving the home team drew crowds in excess of 55,000 in the inaugural edition.|$|E
25|$|A {{butterfly}} gag is a wing-shaped gag that {{is usually}} inflatable {{by means of a}} rubber bulb.

This kind of gag is very hard to keep in the wearer; the use of an O-ring in front of the gag strapped to the back of the head will hold the butterfly gag in place.|$|E
25|$|On July 27, 1927, {{they closed}} the dam's sluice gates and allowed Dell Creek to <b>fill</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> lake basin {{that had been}} {{excavated}} and graded behind the dam. This resulted in a large pooling {{of water from the}} flow of Dell Creek, which was named Lake Delton. Newman had spent $600,000 on the construction by that date and expected to spend another $400,000 to build the resort. They built a lock between the lake and the Wisconsin River to allow small boats and canoes to travel between the bodies of water.|$|E

This process produces an emission spectrum of X-rays at a few discrete frequencies, sometimes referred to as the spectral lines. The spectral lines generated depend on the target (anode) element used and thus are called characteristic lines. Usually these are transitions from upper shells into K shell (called K lines), into L shell (called L lines) and so on.|$|E
25|$|Land {{reclamation}} works {{involving the}} use of over 52,000,000cubicmeters (68,000,000yd3) of landfill and seafill began in Changi in June 1975, even as the airport at Paya Lebar {{was still in the}} midst of expansion works. About 2squarekilometers (494acres) of swamp land was cleared and filled with 12,000,000cubicmeters (15,700,000yd3) of earth from the nearby hills, while another 40,000,000cubicmeters (52,300,000yd3) of sand were used to <b>fill</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> seabed. Canals were built to drain water from three existing rivers, namely Sungei Tanah Merah Besar, Sungei Ayer Gemuroh and Sungei Mata Ikan. In total, 870hectares (2,150acres) were reclaimed, raising the total site area to 1,300 hectares. Of this, landfill accounted for 200hectares (494acres) while seafill represented 670hectares (1,655acres).|$|E
25|$|A further {{possible}} {{improvement is}} the use of a second pit which is used in alternation with the first pit. It means that the first pit can rest for the duration of time it takes to <b>fill</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> second pit. When the second pit is also full, then the first pit is emptied. The fecal sludge collected in that first pit has in the meantime undergone some degree of pathogen reduction although this is unlikely to be complete. This is a common design for so-called twin-pit pour flush toilets and increases the safety for those having to enter the pit. Also VIPs are sometimes built with two pits, although for VIP toilets one problem can be that the users may not stick to this alternation method and fill up both pits at the same time.|$|E

Instead of handing in the application form to election official, Gomez slipped the form in his bag. At the time, Sylvia Lim {{had gone to a}} waiting area and did not witness the event. However, on the eve of Nomination Day, James Gomez went to collect his minority-race candidate certificate claiming he had submitted the application form. Following two days of dispute between both sides, the Elections Department was able to produce video evidence showing that James Gomez did not submit the application form; a day later, James Gomez apologised to the Elections Department saying he was distracted by his busy schedule.|$|E
25|$|There are {{numerous}} boxes, barrels, and other smashables {{scattered around the}} levels. Most contain fairy dust for use in special attacks, but a few contain coins and food. Coins are of either gold or red colors (called Far Far Pounds). In addition to the aforementioned smashables, a source of Far Far Pounds can often be just finding them scattered around, as well as under certain circumstances, enemies. Gold coins are worth 3 pounds and red coins are worth 10 pounds. The player has to fight with fists and swords against multiple enemies, like pirates, guards, athletes, evil trees, and witches, depending on the level the player is in. After an enemy has sustained several hits, a finishing move {{can be used on}} them, which, when activated, plays an animation of the currently selected character finishing off the enemy, defeating them instantly, as well as causing them to drop special purple fairy dust. Felled enemies will drop fairy dust that will <b>fill</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> three-part special attack meter.|$|E
25|$|Nervous system repair: Upon {{injury to}} nerve cells within {{the central nervous}} system, astrocytes <b>fill</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> space to form a glial scar, and may {{contribute}} to neural repair. The role of astrocytes in CNS regeneration following injury is not well understood though. The glial scar has traditionally been described as an impermeable barrier to regeneration, thus implicating a negative role in axon regeneration. However, recently, it was found through genetic ablation studies that astrocytes are actually required for regeneration to occur. Even more exciting, these authors found that the astrocyte scar is actually essential for stimulated axons (that axons that have been coaxed to grow via neurotrophic supplementation) to extend through the injured spinal cord. Interestingly, astrocytes that have been pushed into a reactive phenotype (termed astrogliosis, defined by upregulation of GFAP expression, a definition still under debate) may actually be toxic to neurons, releasing signals that can kill neurons. Much work, however, remains to elucidate their role in nervous system injury.|$|E
