Chestertown, reports a maximum rainfall total of 14inches (350mm), with other locales reporting similar values. Extreme river flooding causes moderate damage to bridges and roads, resulting in a damage toll of $7.9million (1999USD, $10million 2008USD) throughout the state. In addition, over 250,000 residents are without electricity because of high winds blowing down power lines. More than 28people are forced to be rescued by boat as a result of severe flooding.

5|$|The lone {{portion of}} NY590 {{within the city}} of Rochester runs due north–south, acting as a divider between {{residential}} neighborhoods {{to the west and}} the Irondequoit Creek valley (much of which is part of Ellison Park) to the east.

5|$|As Longstreet's left division, under Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws, advanced, they {{unexpectedly}} found Maj. Gen. Daniel Sickles's III Corps {{directly in}} their path. Sickles had been {{dissatisfied with the}} position assigned him on {{the southern end of}} Cemetery Ridge. Seeing ground better suited for artillery positions a <b>half</b> <b>mile</b> (800m) to the west— centered at the Sherfy farm's Peach Orchard—he violated orders and advanced his corp to the slightly higher ground along the Emmitsburg Road, moving away from Cemetery Ridge. The new line ran from Devil's Den, northwest to the Peach Orchard, then northeast along the Emmitsburg Road to south of the Codori farm. This created an untenable salient at the Peach Orchard; Brig. Gen. Andrew A. Humphreys's division (in position along the Emmitsburg Road) and Maj. Gen. David B. Birney's division (to the south) were subject to attacks from two sides and were spread out over a longer front than their small corps could defend effectively. The Confederate artillery was ordered to open fire at 3:00p.m. After failing to attend a meeting at this time of Meade's corps commanders, Meade rode to Sickles' position and demanded an explanation of the situation. Knowing a Confederate attack was imminent and a retreat would be endangered, Meade refused Sickles' offer to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|M-54 {{starts at}} exit109 along I-75 and follows Dort Highway northward through {{suburban}} Grand Blanc Township. The {{area near the}} southern end is mostly residential, but north of Reid Road, there is the Grand Blanc Metal Center plant for GM {{to the east of}} the highway. M-54 intersects Hill and Saginaw roads in the unincorporated community of Whigville as the trunkline passes out of the industrial area surrounding the plant.

There is a rail line owned by CSX Transportation that runs parallel to the highway about a <b>half</b> <b>mile</b> (0.8km) to the east. North of Atherton Road, M-54 crosses into Flint and runs through the city's east side. The trunkline intersects I-69 near the Amtrak station in the city, and a crossing with a line of the Canadian National Railway. Between Robert T. Longway Boulevard and Davison Road, Dort Highway passes another industrial area.
