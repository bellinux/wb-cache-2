Its opportunities {{will be limited}} because its instruments need to be pointed away from the Sun at all times to avoid damage.

5|$|Upon {{reaching}} Mt. Battle, people inform Wes and Rui that Cipher <b>has</b> <b>already</b> <b>taken</b> {{over the}} first section of the mountain. After battling nine other Trainers, Wes battles the Cipher administrator Dakim. Dakim owns a Shadow Entei, {{who is one of the}} trio of legendary beasts. After defeating Dakim, Wes heads to The Under, which is an underground city located underneath Pyrite Town, and under the control of Cipher. More members of the Kids Grid are here. They tell the player of Venus, another Cipher administrator, who has influence over The Under. After Wes confronts Venus, the owner of the second legendary beast Suicune, she flees. Next, Wes and Rui head to the Shadow Pokémon Lab, where Pokémon are transformed into Shadow Pokémon. After defeating numerous Cipher peons, Wes faces Ein, the final Cipher administrator and the owner of the final legendary beast Raikou.|$|E

After some verbal sparring with Mr. Bennet baiting his wife, it transpires that this visit <b>has</b> <b>already</b> <b>taken</b> place at Netherfield, Mr. Bingley's rented house.

25|$|The Open Brethren {{teach that}} baptism plays {{no role in}} salvation, and is {{properly}} performed only after a person professes Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour. Baptism is an outward expression that symbolizes the inward cleansing or remission of a person's sins which <b>has</b> <b>already</b> <b>taken</b> place at salvation. Baptism is also a public identification of that person with Jesus Christ. In many assemblies, an individual is considered {{a member of that}} assembly once he or she is baptized.|$|E
25|$|A {{proof that}} showed that P ≠ NP would lack the {{practical}} computational benefits of a proof that P = NP, but would nevertheless represent a very significant advance in computational complexity theory and provide guidance for future research. It would allow one to show in a formal way that many common problems cannot be solved efficiently, so that the attention of researchers can be focused on partial solutions or solutions to other problems. Due to widespread belief in P ≠ NP, much of this focusing of research <b>has</b> <b>already</b> <b>taken</b> place.|$|E

25|$|The {{ordinance}} {{of water}} baptism is an outward symbol of an inner conversion that <b>has</b> <b>already</b> <b>taken</b> place. Therefore, most Pentecostal groups practice believer's baptism by immersion. The majority of Pentecostals do not view baptism as essential for salvation, and likewise, most Pentecostals are Trinitarian {{and use the}} traditional Trinitarian baptismal formula. However, Oneness Pentecostals view baptism as an essential and necessary part of the salvation experience and, as non-Trinitarians, reject {{the use of the}} traditional baptismal formula. For more information on Oneness Pentecostal baptismal beliefs, see the following section on Statistics and denominations.|$|E
25|$|As {{the book}} opens, James R. Herold, prosperous {{businessman}} from Omaha, Nebraska, consults Wolfe about re-establishing {{contact with his}} son, whom he had (as it eventually transpired) falsely accused of theft eleven years before. The son, Paul Herold, had consequently broken almost all ties with the family, changed his name and moved to New York City. Even the latter meagre information was only known because Paul has recently sent his sister a birthday card postmarked NYC. The father <b>has</b> <b>already</b> <b>taken</b> obvious steps such as {{an ad in the}} newspaper and consulting the Missing Persons Dept of NYPD.|$|E
25|$|Many {{underlying}} {{proposals are}} designed to limit global temperature changes {{to no more than}} 2°C above pre-industrial levels, of which 0.8°C <b>has</b> <b>already</b> <b>taken</b> place and another 0.5–0.7°C is already committed. 2°C is usually seen as the upper temperature limit to avoid 'dangerous global warming'. Due to only minor efforts in global Climate change mitigation it is highly likely that the world {{will not be able to}} reach this particular target. The EU might then not only be forced to accept a less ambitious global target. Because the planned emissions reductions in the European energy sector (95% by 2050) are derived directly from the 2°C target since 2007, the EU will have to revise its energy policy paradigm.|$|E

Not wanting to be alone, Mary does not allow Cathleen {{to go to the}} kitchen to finish dinner and offers her a drink instead. Mary does most of the talking and discusses her love for fog but her hatred of the foghorn and her husband’s obvious obsession with money. It is obvious that Mary <b>has</b> <b>already</b> <b>taken</b> some of her “prescription.” She talks about her past in a Catholic convent and the promise she once had as a pianist {{and the fact that it}} was once thought that she might become a nun. She also makes it clear that while she fell in love with her husband from the time she met him, she had never taken to the theatre crowd. She shows her arthritic hands to Cathleen and explains that the pain in her hands is why she needs her prescription – an explanation which is untrue and transparent to Cathleen.|$|E

Referring to his rival as [...] "Achilles", the narrator senses the new suitor may end up being discarded {{as quickly as he}} was.
