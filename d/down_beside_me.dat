60|$|He {{came into}} the semi-silence room of the club {{the other day and}} sat <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E

50|$|Will I {{find you}} there down among the reeds?Are {{you waiting for}} me there in the still waters?Are you glad to see me?Sit <b>down</b> here <b>beside</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear old Clara! Come and sit <b>down</b> here <b>beside</b> <b>me.</b> I {{have not}} had a chat for days. But, oh, what a troubled face! What is it then?" [...] She put up her {{forefinger}} and smoothed her sister's brow with it.|$|R
60|$|Sally gave {{me another}} little hug, and then, {{disengaging}} herself from my arms, she sat <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} sit <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> Aileen," [...] said Edgar, earnestly, tenderly, and firmly, taking her hand, [...] "I will tell you." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{hesitated a}} moment, {{and then sat}} <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> and laid her hand on mine. As if that honour would {{obliterate}} any remembrance! ...|$|E
60|$|The next I knew {{after that}} I was awakened {{out of a}} sound sleep {{by a man who}} walked up and <b>down</b> close <b>beside</b> <b>me.</b> His face was drawn and strained, and the sweat rolled down his nose from his forehead. One hand was {{clutched}} tightly against his chest by the other hand, and blood dripped down upon the floor as he walked. He wore the uniform of the Mercenaries. From without, as through thick walls, came the muffled roar of bursting bombs. I was in some building that was locked in combat with some other building.|$|R
60|$|But, as I spoke, {{there came}} {{the sound of}} {{automobile}} wheels on the gravel. A large red car was coming up the drive. I dropped Audrey's hand, and she stepped back and {{was lost in the}} shrubbery. The car slowed <b>down</b> and stopped <b>beside</b> <b>me.</b> There were two women in the tonneau. One, who was dark and handsome, I did not know. The other was Mrs Drassilis.|$|R
50|$|The song's {{composition}} {{employed a}} strophic form with a chorus. The sentimental lyrics comprised a narrative set to music, {{a new style}} in the 1890s.First verse:A passing policeman found a little child,She walked beside him, dried her tears and smiled.Said he to her kindly now you must not cry,I will find your ma-ma for you by and by.At the station when he asked her for her name,And she answered Jennie, it made him exclaim:"At last of your mother, I have now a trace,Your little features bring back her sweet face."Chorus:Do not fear, my little darling, and I will take you home.Come sit <b>down</b> close <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> no more from me you shall roam.For you were a babe in arms, when your mother left me one day.Left me at home, deserted, alone, and took you, my child, away.|$|R

60|$|Then he sat <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> {{and took}} my hand in his, and with very gentle words began to reason and argue with me.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Poor child,’ she said, ‘poor child! Sit <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>me</b> here, {{and tell}} me all about it. My heart really bleeds to see you. How does time go?’ ...|$|E
6000|$|As for the women, {{they were}} indescribable. Some of them wore {{little more than}} a blanket, others were clothed in the height of European fashion,--or {{something}} like it,--and all had evidently put on their [...] "Sunday's best." [...] One stout and remarkably healthy young woman appeared in a brilliant skirt, and an indescribable hat with ostrich feathers on her woolly head. She sat herself <b>down</b> close <b>beside</b> <b>me</b> and went to sleep {{at the beginning of the}} sermon--not out of irreverence, I am persuaded, but from heat. In this state she continued swaying to and fro to the end of the discourse, occasionally drooping, as though she meant to make a pillow of my shoulder, which she would certainly have done, but for a more modestly clad Hottentot girl at her other side, who, evidently scandalised, kept poking at her continuously with her elbow. In justice to the congregation I am bound to add, that I saw very few sleepers. They were most attentive and earnest, despite the distracting elements of a humorous kind that obtruded themselves.|$|R
60|$|Soon {{after sunset}} the Lama returned, {{bringing}} Campbell; who, having mistaken some glacier-fed lakes {{at the back}} of Kinchinjhow for those of Cholamoo, was looking for me. He too had speculated on having to pass the night under a rock, with one plaid for himself and servant; in which case I am sure they would both have been frozen to death, having no pony to lie <b>down</b> <b>beside.</b> He told <b>me</b> that after I had quitted Kongra Lama, leaving him with the Tchebu Lama and Phipun, the Dingpun and twenty men came up, and very civilly but formally forbade their crossing the frontier; but that upon explaining his motives, and representing that it would save him ten days' journey, the Dingpun had relented, and promised to conduct the whole party to the Donkia pass.|$|R
60|$|For {{three days}} and nights Idris had not moved from my side. She {{administered}} to all my wants, and never slept nor rested. She did not hope; and therefore she neither endeavoured to read the physician's countenance, nor to watch for symptoms of recovery. All her thought was to attend on me to the last, and then to lie <b>down</b> and die <b>beside</b> <b>me.</b> On the third night animation was suspended; to the eye and touch of all I was dead. With earnest prayer, almost with force, Adrian tried to draw Idris from me. He exhausted every adjuration, her child's welfare and his own. She shook her head, and wiped a stealing tear from her sunk cheek, but would not yield; she entreated {{to be allowed to}} watch me that one night only, with such affliction and meek earnestness, that she gained her point, and sat silent and motionless, except when, stung by intolerable remembrance, she kissed my closed eyes and pallid lips, and pressed my stiffening hands to her beating heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "No bad advice, my son," [...] {{said the}} honest glover, [...] "But you, {{what will you}} do? Will you lie <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> or take a part of Conachar's bed?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor child," [...] she said, [...] "poor child! Sit <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>me</b> here, {{and tell}} me all about it. My heart really bleeds to see you. How does time go?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'David Copperfield,' said Mrs. Creakle, {{leading me}} to a sofa, and sitting <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>me.</b> 'I {{want to speak}} to you very particularly. I have {{something}} to tell you, my child.' ...|$|E

6000|$|Whereupon my {{daughter}}, making <b>me</b> sit <b>down,</b> knelt <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> {{and told}} me {{from end to end}} the most marvellous story I had ever heard or read of. Something of it I had already known from the Archbishop Paleologue's later letters, but of all else I was ignorant. Far away in the great West beyond the Atlantic, and again on the fringe of the Eastern seas, I had been thrilled to my heart's core by the heroic devotion and fortitude of my daughter in yielding herself for her country's sake to that fearful ordeal of the Crypt; of the grief of the nation at her reported death, news of which was so mercifully and wisely withheld from me as long as possible; of the supernatural rumours that took root so deep; but no word or hint had come to me {{of a man who had}} come across the orbit of her life, much less of all that has resulted from it. Neither had I known of her being carried off, or of the thrice gallant rescue of her by Rupert. Little wonder that I thought so highly of him even at the first moment I had a clear view of him when he sank down to sleep before me. Why, the man must be a marvel. Even our mountaineers could not match such endurance as his. In the course of her narrative my daughter told me of how, being wearied with her long waiting in the tomb, and waking to find herself alone when the floods were out, and even the Crypt submerged, she sought safety and warmth elsewhere; and how she came to the Castle in the night, and found the strange man alone. I said: [...] "That was dangerous, daughter, if not wrong. The man, brave and devoted as he is, must answer me--your father." [...] At that she was greatly upset, and before going on with her narrative, drew me close in her arms, and whispered to me: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Mellon," [...] he said, sitting <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> and patting my dog, [...] "I {{imagined}} {{from your}} tones, as I entered, {{that you were}} having some serious conversation with my wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Sit <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>me</b> here,’ she returned, {{patting the}} further {{corner of the}} bench. ‘I will follow you in a moment. O, I am so tired—feel how my heart leaps! Where is your thief?’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! {{because they}} are so very, very funny. Sit <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> and I'll tell you about three kittens I once had. They were very little--at least they were little before they got big." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{a little}} while {{it seemed to me}} as though I had always been alone on the moon. I hunted for a time with a certain intentness, but the heat was still very great, and the {{thinness}} of the air felt like a hoop about one's chest. I came presently into a hollow basin bristling with tall, brown, dry fronds about its edge, and I sat down under these to rest and cool. I intended to rest for only {{a little while}}. I put <b>down</b> my clubs <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> and sat resting my chin on my hands. I saw with a sort of colourless interest that the rocks of the basin, where here and there the crackling dry lichens had shrunk away to show them, were all veined and splattered with gold, that here and there bosses of rounded and wrinkled gold projected from among the litter. What did that matter now? A sort of languor had possession of my limbs and mind, I did not believe for a moment that we should ever find the sphere in that vast desiccated wilderness. I seemed to lack a motive for effort until the Selenites should come. Then I supposed I should exert myself, obeying that unreasonable imperative that urges a man before all things to preserve and defend his life, albeit he may preserve it only to die more painfully in a little while.|$|R
60|$|The {{botanist}} <b>beside</b> <b>me</b> dreams, I know, of vindications {{for that}} woman.|$|R

6000|$|I {{have been}} quite touched by {{the change in the}} poor old man. When he sat <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> he said in a very gentle way, [...] "I want to say {{something}} to you, miss." ...|$|E
60|$|He sat <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> {{taking some}} pains {{to sit on}} the form, I thought, in {{imitation}} of the print of his illustrious model on the sofa. And really he did look very like it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit <b>down</b> <b>beside</b> <b>me</b> here," [...] she returned, {{patting the}} farther {{corner of the}} bench. [...] "I will follow you in a moment. O, I am so tired--feel how my heart leaps! Where is your thief?" ...|$|E
60|$|Never, I believe, came such supreme {{happiness}} with obedience. I {{felt her}} hand upon my brow, and the fan moved again. I fell asleep once more from sheer weariness of joy. She was there, <b>beside</b> <b>me.</b> She had been there, <b>beside</b> <b>me,</b> through it all, {{and it was}} her touch which had brought me back to life.|$|R
