25|$|Hermit crabs {{are more}} closely related to squat {{lobsters}} and porcelain crabs than they are to true crabs (Brachyura). However, the relationship of <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> to the rest of Paguroidea is a highly contentious topic. Many studies based on physical characteristics, genetic information, and combined data, support the longstanding hypothesis that the <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> in the family Lithodidae are derived hermit crabs and should be classified as a family within Paguroidea. Other researchers have challenged this, asserting that the Lithodidae (<b>king</b> <b>crabs)</b> should be placed with the Hapalogastridae in a separate superfamily Lithodoidea. Six families are formally recognized in the superfamily Paguroidea, containing around 1100 species in total in 120 genera.|$|E

2500|$|In early classifications, squat {{lobsters}} were placed {{together in the}} superfamily Galatheoidea alongside the porcelain crabs of the family Porcellanidae. In the early 21st century, however, {{the assumption that the}} various families of squat lobster were closely related began to be questioned. Although superficially similar, there were few morphological characteristics that united the {{squat lobsters}} to the exclusion of other families in the Anomura. With extensive DNA sequence data, it is now accepted that squat lobsters do not make up a single, monophyletic group. Rather, the Chirostylidae and Kiwaidae are only relatively distantly related to the other squat lobsters, and are closer to hermit crabs and <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> (Paguroidea), the mole crabs in the superfamily Hippoidea, and the small families Lomisidae and Aeglidae.

40|$|Abstract only. The red <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> (Paralithodes camtschaticus) is {{an alien}} {{invasive}} {{species in the}} Barents Sea representing a value {{as well as a}} potential pest.

Since the impact of the <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> on the native species is not known, bycatch costs in traditional fisheries were used as a proxy for cost related to the invasion. The model suggests that the <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> stock should be reduced in order to optimize the profit of the total fishery. The model is robust to changes in input parameters.

60|$|Plants {{no doubt}} preceded animal forms in this {{invasion}} of the land, but the animals probably followed up the plant emigration {23} very closely. The first problem that the plant had to solve was the problem of some sustaining stiff support to hold up its fronds to the sunlight when the buoyant water was withdrawn; the second was the problem of getting water from the swampy ground below to the tissues of the plant, {{now that it was}} no longer close at hand. The two problems were solved by the development of woody tissue which both sustained the plant and acted as water carrier to the leaves. The Record of the Rocks is suddenly crowded by a vast variety of woody swamp plants, many of them of great size, big tree mosses, tree ferns, gigantic horsetails and the like. And with these, age by age, there crawled out of the water a great variety of animal forms. There were centipedes and millipedes; there were the first primitive insects; there were creatures related to the ancient <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> and sea scorpions which became the earliest spiders and land scorpions, and presently there were vertebrated animals.|$|E
50|$|Blue <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> can {{be found}} in the Bering Sea in {{relatively}} small abundances compared to red <b>king</b> <b>crabs.</b> The main populations near Alaska are found near the Diomede Islands, Point Hope, St. Matthew Island, and the Pribilof Islands. Additionally, populations exist in the Norton Sound all the way to the St. Lawrence Islands. There are smaller populations located off the eastern coast of Asia, near northern Japan and Siberia. Blue <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> have a more northerly distribution compared to red <b>king</b> <b>crabs,</b> which is due to the colder waters of the northern Bering Sea being suitable for blue <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> to survive. The unique population locations of the blue king crab are a result from glacial interactions with the water temperature of the Bering Sea. A period of increased temperature limited the spread of cold-water species, pushing the species further northward into the depths of the Bering Sea. Not only did blue <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> retreat to the northern stretches of the Bering Sea, but they also had a possible population shrinkage due to glacial epochs.|$|E
50|$|Overall, the red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> {{have a high}} {{adaptation}} {{capacity in}} changes of salinity level because the crabs retain their vital functions and also their feeding locomotor activities. However, {{there is a difference}} in the salinity tolerance between juvenile red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> and adult red <b>king</b> <b>crabs.</b> Juvenile red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> are slightly more tolerant to low concentrations of salinity because the juvenile's volume regulation is significantly better. Juveniles are consistently hyposmotic to the seawater because they have lower sodium concentration in their hemolymph. Due to the smaller size of the juveniles their exoskeleton is structurally more rigid. The adult red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> are hyperosmotic in high salinity and becomes hyposmotic in lower salinity. The hyperosmoticity is due to the higher sodium and potassium concentrations in the hemolymph compared to the surrounding water they live in.|$|E

40|$|Abstract onlyThe alien {{invasive}} red <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> in the Barents Sea represents both {{a threat}} through impacts on benthic ecosystem functions, {{and a source}} of income for fishing communities in Northern Norway. Determining the risk the <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> represents is central both with respect to international obligations and to determine the socially acceptable level of <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> invasion. Uncertainties due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the impact of invasive species and the socio-economic consequences of management options make conventional risk assessment and application of the precautionary approach based purely on scientific considerations inappropriate. Q-methodology was applied in order to identify the different perspectives among key stakeholders and researchers on the risk the <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> represents and how the crab should be managed. The study identified the areas of agreement and disagreement between the different social perspectives and how these groups perceive what risk the crab represents. This information can be used as input in a broader evaluation on how the <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> should be managed in Norwegian waters...|$|R

50|$|Red (P. camtschaticus) {{and blue}} (P. platypus) <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> {{are some of}} the most {{important}} fisheries in Alaska, however populations have fluctuated in the past 25 years and some areas are currently closed due to overfishing. The two species are similar in size, shape and life history. Habitat is the main factor separating the range of blue and red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> in the Bering Sea. Red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> prefer shallow, muddy or sandy habitats in Bristol Bay and Norton Sound, while blue <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> prefer the deeper areas made up of cobble, gravel and rock that occur around the Pribilof, St. Matthew, St. Lawrence and the Diomede Islands.|$|E
50|$|<b>King</b> <b>crabs</b> are {{generally}} {{thought to be}} derived from hermit crab-like ancestors, which may explain the asymmetry still found in the adult forms. This ancestry is supported by several anatomical peculiarities which are present only in <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> and hermit crabs. Although some doubt still exists about this theory, <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> are the most widely quoted example of carcinisation among the Decapoda. The evidence for this explanation comes from the asymmetry of the king crab's abdomen, which is thought to reflect the asymmetry of hermit crabs, which must fit into a spiral shell. Although formerly classified among the hermit crabs in the superfamily Paguroidea, <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> are now placed in a separate superfamily, Lithodoidea. This is not without controversy as there is a widespread consensus in the scientific community that <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> are derived from hermit crabs and closely related to pagurid hermit crabs, and therefore a separate superfamily in the classification poorly reflects the phylogenetic relationship of this taxon.|$|E

40|$|In August of 2005, {{fishing in}} the Bering Sea and Aleutian Island crab {{fisheries}} began under a new sharebased management program (the “rationalization program”). The program is unique in several ways, including the allocation of processing shares corresponding to {{a portion of the}} harvest share pool. Under the program, 90 percent of the annual harvest share allocation is issued as “Class A ” individual fishing quota (IFQ), which must be delivered in a designated region and may only be delivered to a processor holding unused individual processing quota (IPQ). The recent reauthorization of the Magnuson Stevens Act (MSA) included a provision to exempt custom processing in the North region of the Bering Sea C. opilio fishery from processing use caps established under the crab rationalization program.

50|$|One {{environmental}} parameter {{that requires}} regulatory {{function of the}} red king crab is the season due to the temperature change. Mature female red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> must remain in warmer water (near 4 °C) to ensure the eggs {{will be ready for}} hatching, while the male red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> stay in relatively cold water (near 1.5 °C) to conserve energy output. In spring (May), female red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> move to shallow coastal areas to moult and spawn, and males join the females in the shallow water prior to moulting. In the summer (mid-June through mid-November), these crabs spend their time in fairly deep water, below established summer thermocline. When the thermocline breaks down, the red <b>king</b> <b>crabs</b> migrate back to intermediate depths where they remain until the female red king crab release the eggs fertilized in the previous spawning.|$|E

40|$|Background: Salmon trypsin {{is shown}} to {{increase}} secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL) - 8 from human airway epithelial cells through activation of PAR- 2. Secretion of IL- 8 induced by <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> trypsin is observed in a different concentration range compared to salmon trypsin, {{and seems to be}} only partially related to PAR- 2 activation. This report aim to identify differences in the molecular structure of <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> trypsin (Paralithodes camtschaticus) compared to salmon (Salmo salar) and bovine trypsin (Bos taurus) that might influence the ability to activate protease-activated receptor- 2 (PAR- 2). Results: During purification <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> trypsin displayed stronger binding capacity to the anionic column used in fast protein liquid chromatography compared to fish trypsins, and was identified as a slightly bigger molecule. Measurements of enzymatic activity yielded no obvious differences between the trypsins tested. Molecular modelling showed that <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> trypsin has a large area with strong negative electrostatic potential compared to the smaller negative areas in bovine and salmon trypsins. Bovine and salmon trypsins also displayed areas with strong positive electrostatic potential, a feature lacking in the <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> trypsin. Furthermore we have identified 3 divergent positions (Asp 196, Arg 244, and Tyr 247) located near the substrate binding pocket of <b>king</b> <b>crab</b> trypsin that might affect the binding and cleavage of PAR- 2. Conclusion: These preliminary results indicate that electrostatic interactions could be of importance in binding, cleavage and subsequent activation of PAR- 2...|$|R
