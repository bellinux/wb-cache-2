5|$|It is {{wonderful}} {{that both of}} these things occurred under Valerian; {{and it is the}} more remarkable in this case when we consider his previous conduct, for he had been mild and friendly toward the men of God, for none of the emperors before him had treated them so kindly and favorably; and not even those who were said openly to be Christians received them with such manifest hospitality and friendliness as he <b>did</b> <b>at</b> the beginning of his reign. For his entire house was filled with pious persons and was a church of God.|$|E

5|$|After Hearst {{conveyed}} {{his enthusiasm}} for the project, Beloso sold Byne the stones for $85,000, including the cloister, the chapter house, the refectory and the dormitory for novices. With Byne's commission, Hearst was to pay $97,000, a price roughly equivalent to $ as of 20. Byne started immediately on the project, organizing men and materials, and beginning the removal of stones. Hearst's main architect Julia Morgan sent her associate architect Walter T. Steilberg who arrived on March 9, 1931. Steilberg recommended that Hearst buy the old church portal, which he <b>did,</b> <b>at</b> Byne's price of $1,500. Under the direction of Byne and Steilberg, the monastery was carefully labeled as it was dismantled stone by stone. Antonio Gomez, the local foreman praised by Byne and Steilberg, numbered the blocks on architectural drawings and painted the number in red {{on the back of}} each stone.|$|E

Despite initial doubts {{about the state of the}} Reformation in Scotland, Knox found the country significantly changed since he was carried off in the galley in 1547. When he toured various parts of Scotland preaching the reformed doctrines and liturgy, he was welcomed by many of the nobility including two future regents of Scotland, the Earl of Moray and the Earl of Mar.|$|E

5|$|By {{the second}} half of the fourteenth century, in {{addition}} to forces raised on the basis of common service and feudal obligations, money contracts of bonds or bands of manrent, similar to English indentures of the same period, were being used to retain more professional troops, particular men-at-arms and archers. In practice, forms of service tended to blur and overlap, and several major Scottish lords brought contingents from their kindred. These systems produced relatively large numbers of poorly armoured infantry, usually armed with 12–14 foot spears. They often formed the large close order defensive formations of shiltrons, able to counter mounted knights as they <b>did</b> <b>at</b> Bannockburn, or infantry assault as at Otterburn in 1388, but vulnerable to arrows (and later artillery fire) and relatively immobile, as they proved at Halidon Hill in 1333 and Humbleton Hill in 1402.|$|E

He <b>did</b> <b>at</b> one point consider a plan to cut off North Korea with radioactive poisons; he did not recommend it at the time, although he later broached the matter with Eisenhower, then president-elect, in 1952. In 1954, in an interview published after his death, he stated he had wanted to drop atomic bombs on enemy bases, but in 1960, he challenged a statement by Truman that he had advocated using atomic bombs. Truman issued a retraction, stating that he had no evidence of the claim; it was merely his personal opinion.|$|E

5|$|Despite Gray {{constantly}} seeking {{collectors and}} {{people to help}} him with the Harvard herbarium, in the first fifteen years he was at Harvard, no graduate entered botany as a career. This changed in 1858 with the arrival of Daniel Cady Eaton, who had graduated from Yale University in 1857 and came to Harvard to study with Gray. Eaton later returned to Yale to be a botany professor and oversee its herbarium, just as Gray <b>did</b> <b>at</b> Harvard. Daniel Eaton was the grandson of Amos Eaton, whose textbooks Gray had studied during his college days. Eaton influenced the teaching style of Gray, and both required practical work of their students. Gray retained the Fisher post until 1873 while living in the Asa Gray House.|$|E
5|$|Expected to {{last only}} two days, the {{evacuation}} of remaining evacuees proved more difficult than rescue organizations anticipated as transportation convoys struggled with damaged infrastructure {{and a growing number}} of evacuees. By the morning of September 1, Governor Blanco reported that the number of evacuees in the Superdome was down to 2,500. However, by evening, eleven hours after evacuation efforts began, the Superdome held 10,000 more people than it <b>did</b> <b>at</b> dawn. Evacuees from across the city swelled the crowd to about 30,000, believing the arena was the best place to get a ride out of town.|$|E
5|$|Gray was {{not chosen}} for camouflage, however, it <b>did,</b> <b>at</b> times, provide {{enough of a}} mask along tree lines during battle; keeping the line of Infantry hidden long enough to strike effectively. At {{the time of the}} American Civil War, the {{usefulness}} of camouflage was not generally recognized. Gray was chosen for Confederate uniforms because gray dye could be made relatively cheaply and it was the standard uniform color of the various State Militias. The gray uniforms worn by early State volunteers was normally a shade of cadet gray, which is not suitable for combat wear, as it gives away the position of the individual easily from its bright blue-gray tones, and for this reason it was preserved by some men for dress-parade functions. The gray mentioned is dull toned, often varying in color depending on the region and time during the conflict, resulting in a uniform that could blend in with the tree lines, or hide the men in the field wearing them.|$|E

(After seven years the jetty was replaced by a stone pier built by the government on the natural reef). Similarly the town of Tathra was created through the erection of a small jetty, built so that the local farmers could gain access to coastal shipping which previously had stopped 25km away at Merimbula.|$|E
5|$|Once {{over the}} eastern Gulf of Mexico, the storm shifted its course to the west-southwest and {{gradually}} recovered its intensity. The {{path of the}} storm brought it close {{to the mouth of}} the Rio Grande in early August. Few ships encountered the small storm as it regained hurricane status on August4, just aday before striking northern Mexico with winds of 90mph (145km/h)—making it close to a modern-day Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale. Striking close to the border between the United States and Mexico, the storm caused extensive damage in both countries. Winds damaged buildings and crops in Tamaulipas and the southern regions of Texas, with heavy losses to citrus production in the Rio Grande Valley. While only oneperson died in the United States, heavy rains led to catastrophic flooding that claimed at least 31lives in northern Mexico; the worst-hit areas were in and near the city of Monterrey. While monetary losses in Mexico were unclear, the storm <b>did</b> <b>at</b> least $3,000,000 in damages in the United States, measured in contemporary U.S. dollars.|$|E

5|$|Wilfrid {{introduced}} the Rule of Saint Benedict into the monasteries he founded. It appears {{likely that he}} was the first to introduce the Benedictine Rule into England, as evidence is lacking that Augustine's monastery at Canterbury followed the Rule. He also was one of the first Anglo-Saxon bishops to record the gifts of land and property to his church, which he <b>did</b> <b>at</b> Ripon. Easter tables, used to calculate the correct date to celebrate Easter, were brought in from Rome where the Dionysiac Easter tables had been recently introduced. He set up schools and became a religious advisor to the Northumbrian queen Æthelthryth, first wife of Ecgfrith. Æthelthryth donated the land at Hexham where Wilfrid founded a monastery and built a church using some recycled stones from the Roman town of Corbridge. When Wilfrid arrived in York as bishop the cathedral's roof was on the point of collapse; he had it repaired and covered in lead, and had glass set in the windows.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} four years of Henry's reign Gerard was one of the king's chief advisors, along with Robert of Meulan, Count of Meulan in Normandy and later Earl of Leicester. Gerard was one of Henry's {{greatest}} supporters among the bishops during the Investiture Crisis. In 1101 Gerard witnessed a treaty between Henry and Robert, the Count of Flanders, which sought as far as possible to distance Robert from any future conflict between Henry and his elder brother Robert Curthose, or between Henry and King Philip I of France. After Gerard's return from Rome he restored Ranulf Flambard to the see of Durham. In 1102 Anselm refused to consecrate three bishops, two of whom had received investiture from the king; Gerard offered to consecrate them instead, but all except one refused. From 1105 onwards Gerard slowly began to embrace the papal position on investiture of bishops, which opposed laymen investing bishops with the symbols of episcopal authority. As part of his change of position, Gerard withdrew from court to care for his diocese. Towards the end of 1105 Gerard attempted to join Bohemond of Antioch, who was assembling a crusading force in France, but it appears that King Henry prevented Gerard's departure. In 1106 Gerard wrote to Bohemond that he was still preparing to go on crusade, but he never <b>did.</b> <b>At</b> about the same time, Gerard was working to find a mutually acceptable resolution to the Investiture Crisis, writing a number of letters and other works supporting Anselm's and the pope's position. By 1107 King Henry and Anselm had reached an agreement settling the dispute.|$|E
