5|$|The house {{system was}} first {{established}} in 1909, {{when there were}} three houses: Alpha, Beta and Gamma, each of which had a house master and captain.

Every year, the houses competed for the House Shield; points were awarded for all forms of competitions, from sword dancing to vaulting.
