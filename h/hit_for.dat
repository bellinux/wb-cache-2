5|$|Four batters <b>hit</b> <b>for</b> {{the cycle}} {{in the same}} season in which they won the Triple Crown: Nap Lajoie (American League) in 1901; Jimmie Foxx (American League) and Chuck Klein (National League) in 1933; and Lou Gehrig (American League) in 1934. Gehrig is the only player to {{complete}} the MLB Triple Crown in his cycle-hitting season, leading both the National and American Leagues in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in. When Foxx and Klein won in the same season, each was playing for a team in Philadelphia: Klein for the Phillies and Foxx for the Athletics. Three players – John Olerud, Michael Cuddyer, and Bob Watsonhave <b>hit</b> <b>for</b> the cycle in both the National and American Leagues. Family pairs to <b>hit</b> <b>for</b> the cycle include father and son Gary and Daryle Ward, who accomplished the feat in 1980 and 2004, respectively; and grandfather and grandson Gus and David Bell, the elder of whom <b>hit</b> <b>for</b> the cycle in 1951, and the younger in 2004. Leon Culberson, on July 3, 1943, became the last player so far to <b>hit</b> <b>for</b> the cycle with his home run coming on an inside-the-park home run.|$|E
5|$|In other {{baseball}} leagues, {{the cycle}} is achieved less frequently. Through September 4, 2008, 63 players in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), the top-level baseball organization in Japan, have <b>hit</b> <b>for</b> the cycle, {{the most recent}} being Rainel Rosario. Two players have <b>hit</b> <b>for</b> the cycle {{on the same day}} once in NPB history; this has occurred twice in MLB history. One NPB player has also <b>hit</b> <b>for</b> the cycle in an NPB All-Star game. No player has ever <b>hit</b> <b>for</b> the cycle in the MLB All-Star Game or the postseason.|$|E
5|$|Adrián Beltré {{became the}} fourth player to <b>hit</b> <b>for</b> the cycle {{three times in}} his career and the second three-cycle player to <b>hit</b> <b>for</b> the cycle with two {{different}} teams (one with the Seattle Mariners and two with the Texas Rangers). Even though Beltre hit his cycles with two different teams, all the cycles occurred in the same ballpark, Globe Life Park. Beltre's third cycle on August 3, 2015 only took 5 innings, it was the fastest cycle since 1974 at the time.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} achieve greater contig lengths, Illumina HiSeq reads were sub-sampled from shotgun {{sequencing}} of Well II, {{as well as the}} corresponding plates from the fosmid library. Assembly of 90 % of the shotgun reads yielded 4938 contigs with an average length of 2752  bp, which were further assembled with 20 % of the fosmid library sequence reads, generating 655 contigs with average length of 6273  bp. Both contig sets were used for ORF prediction, followed by a local BLASTp search against the CAZy database resulting in a total of 1432 ORFs with significant BLASTp hits (E value <  10 − 3). Using this assembly approach, these hits yielded 13 significant <b>hits</b> <b>for</b> cellulases, 14 <b>hits</b> <b>for</b> xylanases, 34 <b>hits</b> <b>for</b> amylases, 35 <b>hits</b> <b>for</b> proteinases/peptidases and 29 <b>hits</b> <b>for</b> esterases/lipases (Table  1).|$|R

5|$|In 2009, Ian Kinsler had six hits in {{the game}} when he hit his cycle; the {{accomplishment}} came on Jackie Robinson Day, honoring the African-American pioneer who had himself <b>hit</b> <b>for</b> the cycle on August 29, 1948.|$|E
5|$|Reilly (1884), Tip O'Neill (1887), Herman (1931), and Aaron Hill (2012) are {{the only}} players in MLB history who have <b>hit</b> <b>for</b> the cycle twice in one season.|$|E

5|$|Slugging {{percentage}} measures a batter's {{ability to}} <b>hit</b> <b>for</b> power. It is calculated {{by taking the}} batter's total bases (one per each single, two per double, three per triple, and four per home run) and dividing that by the batter's at bats.|$|E

5|$|A {{home run}} {{is a hit}} in which the player reaches home plate, and scores a run on the same play without being called out. Most often in modern baseball, this occurs when a player hits the ball over the outfield wall in fair territory. However, it can occur on a ball hit to the outfield with a fast runner when the ball does not leave the field of play; this is called an inside-the-park home run. Home-run hitters are often likely to be larger, slower players due to their strength, {{and may not be}} fast enough to {{complete}} the triple. The MLB single-season and all-time leader in home runs is Barry Bonds, who hit 73 home runs in the 2001 season and notched 762 in his 22-season career. Bonds never <b>hit</b> <b>for</b> the cycle. The highest on the list to do so is Alex Rodriguez (fourth all-time; 696 home runs as of January 16, 2017), who <b>hit</b> <b>for</b> the cycle on June 5, 1997.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the standard four difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard, and Expert) for each song and instrument, a new Beginner level has been added in World Tour. This difficulty is aimed for younger and unskilled players; notes are generally simple straight lines in time with bass drum beats, and allowing any or no fret button to be held while the note is strummed (for lead and bass guitar), any drum to be <b>hit</b> (<b>for</b> drums), or any sound to be made (for vocals).|$|E
5|$|In {{the top of}} the eighth, Mueller led {{off with}} a single to right and Nixon {{followed}} with his third double of the game. Jason Isringhausen came in to pitch for the Cardinals with the bases loaded and nobody out, and was able the finish the inning without allowing a run to score. Kevin Millar pinch <b>hit</b> <b>for</b> the Red Sox starting pitcher Lowe during this inning. It was the third straight game in which the Red Sox starting pitcher had not allowed an earned run.|$|E
5|$|Kinsler {{has twice}} hit 30 {{home runs and}} stolen 30 bases in the same season (2009 and 2011), {{and is one of}} 12 ballplayers in major league history who have had {{multiple}} 30–30 club seasons. In 2011, he also joined the 20–20 club for the third time, one season shy of the major league record for a second baseman.

5|$|No {{player has}} ever hit a cycle {{in both the}} Central and Pacific Leagues; however, after Alex Ochoa hit his cycle with the Chunichi Dragons on April 13, 2004, he became the only player to hit a cycle in both MLB and NPB. Ochoa hit his first and only cycle in the MLB eight years prior on July 3, 1996, while playing for the New York Mets. Yakult Swallows catcher Atsuya Furuta is the only player to <b>hit</b> <b>for</b> the cycle in an NPB All-Star game, hitting one in game2 of the 1992 series. Furuta's cycle is not {{considered}} an official NPB cycle as it occurred during an exhibition game. Inaba is the only player to <b>hit</b> <b>for</b> the cycle in a rain-shortened game. After hitting a triple {{in the first inning}} and hitting a home run in the fourth, Inaba collected the other two necessary hits in a seven-run fifth inning when the order batted around. Kosuke Fukudome is the only player to have hit a grand slam as the home run of the cycle.|$|E
5|$|On August 14, 2015, on {{the road}} against the Colorado Rockies, Kemp became the first player in the Padres' 7,444-game history to <b>hit</b> <b>for</b> the cycle.

5|$|The Braves scored {{their fifth}} {{run in the}} eighth as Del Crandall hit a one-out triple and then scored on a {{sacrifice}} fly by Mantilla. Don Demeter pinch <b>hit</b> <b>for</b> Churn, the pitcher, in {{the bottom half of}} the inning but the Dodgers were put out in order. Sandy Koufax pitched the top of the ninth for the Dodgers and though he loaded the bases with three successive walks to Aaron, Torre, and DeMerit he did not allow any runs. Moon and Snider led off the bottom of the frame with successive singles. Bob Lillis pinch ran for Snider and Gil Hodges hit another single to load the bases. Don McMahon relieved Burdette, but allowed a fourth consecutive single to Norm Larker which scored Moon, Lillis, and advanced Hodges to third leaving the score 5–4. Warren Spahn relieved McMahon, Carl Furillo pinch <b>hit</b> <b>for</b> Roseboro, and Joe Pignatano pinch ran for Larker. Furillo tied the game, hitting a sacrifice fly which scored Hodges. Spahn allowed a single to Wills and was pulled in favor of Joey Jay. Ron Fairly grounded out as a pinch hitter and Gilliam flew out, leaving the game tied at five runs apiece and forcing extra innings.|$|E

He dives {{in front of the}} shot, taking the fatal <b>hit</b> <b>for</b> Optimus. The game then flashes back to six days earlier.|$|E
5|$|The natural cycle {{has been}} {{accomplished}} five times in NPB history. Fumio Fujimura's second cycle on May 25, 1950, {{was the first time}} a player collected the hits in order. On average, the natural cycle occurs approximately every 13years. Other than Fujimura, the four players to <b>hit</b> <b>for</b> the natural cycle are Kazuhiko Kondo in 1961, Takahiro Tokutsu in 1976, Takanori Okamura in 1985, and Muramatsu in 2003. The natural cycle has only been accomplished in reverse by Ochoa (2004).|$|E
