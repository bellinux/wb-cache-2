40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of surface {{roughness}} appearing on a turned sealing surface on compressive stress and compressive force of copper gaskets (a fiat <b>gasket,</b> a <b>ring</b> joint <b>gasket</b> and a copper wire gasket) was studied. The results obtained can be summarized as follows : (I) In {{the case of a}} flat <b>gasket</b> or a <b>ring</b> joint <b>gasket,</b> in order to ignore both the surface roughness appearing on a turned sealing surface and the cross section of gasket, the compressive stress for sealing had to be nearly equal to 1. 3 times the tensile strength of the copper gasket. (2) In the case of a <b>ring</b> joint <b>gasket</b> or a copper wire gasket, the values of maximum heigh roughness, in which the minimum compressive force for sealing applied, were found in the region between 2 μm and 20 μm or not less than 110 μm respectively...|$|R

The LSm protein structure {{is an example of}} a small beta sheet folded into a short barrel. Individual LSm proteins assemble into a six or seven member <b>doughnut</b> <b>ring</b> (more properly termed a torus), which usually binds to a small RNA molecule to form a ribonucleoprotein complex. The LSm torus assists the RNA molecule to assume and maintain its proper three-dimensional structure. Depending on which LSm proteins and RNA molecule are involved, this ribonucleoprotein complex facilitates a wide variety of RNA processing including degradation, editing, splicing, and regulation.|$|R

Common designs utilize a rubber <b>ring</b> <b>gasket</b> as an on/off switch - when placed between the batteries and circuit board inside the front cover, tightening the screw base deforms and flattens the gasket forcing the battery tip to contact {{the back of the}} printed circuit board which completes the circuit.|$|R
40|$|Failure of a {{ring type}} joint (RTJ) of reactor {{pipeline}} of a hydrocracker unit has been reported.

It was further established that formation of polythionic acid due to presence of H 2 S in the process gas and H 2 O in the system was responsible for initiation of SCC in RTJ components.

5000|$|In {{preparation}} of hitting, every baseball player {{has their own}} particular warm-up routine. Warming up before the game is usually done as a team, at the amateur level, and focuses on helping the hitter get in the correct mindset to hit the ball. The most notable drill used is the [...] "Tee Drill", where you hit a ball off a baseball tee and correct any issues you found during previous games or practices. There are also various hitting devices used during warm up in the [...] "on deck circle" [...] to try and increase the batter's bat velocity. The over weighted supplemental devices include swinging multiple bats, Schutt Dirx (96 oz), Pitcher's Nightmare, Power Fin (14 oz), Standard 23 oz softball bat, heavier 26 oz softball bat, lighter 18 oz softball bat and <b>Doughnut</b> <b>ring</b> (16 oz). [...] Weighted warm-up devices are commonly used because players feel that warming-up with heavier bats will help them increase bat velocity because after the warm-up with a heavier bat, the normal bat feels lighter and they feel they could swing it faster. [...] The effect of these devices is not only mental, {{but it may also}} be physical. Heavy warm up loads stimulate the neural system, allowing for increased muscle activation during lighter bat swings. The use of weighted bats is based on the theory of complex training where sets of heavier and lighter resistances are alternated to increase muscle performance. This theory revolves around the idea that muscle contractions are stronger after reaching near maximal contractions. The postactivation potentiation improves motor neuron pool excitability and increases the number of recruited motor units, both leading to greater power output. The additional weight may also help strengthen the muscles of the forearms and wrist thus increasing bat velocity, though some evidence suggests that the effect is psychological rather than biomechanical.|$|R

Cake doughnuts are fried for about 90 seconds at approximately 190 °C (374 °F) to 198 °C (388 °F), turning once.
