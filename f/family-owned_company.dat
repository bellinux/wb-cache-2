5|$|Malvern {{water has}} been bottled and {{distributed}} in the UK and abroad from {{as early as the}} reign of James I, with water bottling at the Holy Well being recorded in 1622. Various local grocers have bottled and distributed Malvern water during the 19th and early 20th centuries, but it was first bottled on a large commercial scale by Schweppes, who opened a bottling plant at Holywell in Malvern Wells in 1850. As official caterers to the Great Exhibition of 1851, Schweppes introduced the water as Malvern Soda, later renaming it Malvern Seltzer Water in 1856. In 1890 Schweppes moved away from Holywell, entered into a contract with a Colwall family, and built a bottling plant in the village in 1892. The Holywell was subsequently leased to John and Henry Cuff, who bottled there until the 1960s. The Holywell became derelict until 2009 when {{with the aid of a}} Lottery Heritage grant, production of 1200 bottles per day of Holywell Spring Water was recommenced by an independent <b>family-owned</b> <b>company.</b> The well is believed to be the oldest bottling plant in the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{setting was}} principally based on Norway, and the {{cultural}} influences in the film come from Scandinavian culture. Several landmarks in Norway appear in the film, including the Akershus Fortress in Oslo, the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim, and Bryggen in Bergen. Numerous other typical cultural Scandinavian elements are {{also included in the}} film, such as stave churches, trolls, Viking ships, a hot spring, Fjord horses, clothes, and food such as lutefisk. A maypole is also present in the film, as well as the brief appearance of runes in a book that Anna and Elsa's father opens to figure out where the trolls live. A scene where two men argue over whether to stack firewood bark up or bark down is a reference to the perennial Norwegian debate over how to stack firewood properly. The film also contains several elements specifically drawn from Sámi culture, such as the usage of reindeer for transportation and the equipment used to control these, clothing styles (the outfits of the ice cutters), and parts of the musical score. Decorations, such as those on the castle pillars and Kristoff's sled, are also in styles inspired by Sámi duodji decorations. During their field work in Norway, Disney's team, for inspiration, visited Rørosrein, a Sámi <b>family-owned</b> <b>company</b> in the village Plassje that produces reindeer meat and arranges tourist events. Arendelle was inspired by Nærøyfjord, a branch of Norway's longest fjord Sognefjorden, which has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site; while a castle in Oslo with beautiful hand-painted patterns on all four walls served as the inspiration for the kingdom's royal castle interior.|$|E

40|$|Many {{countries}} adopted specific {{tax laws}} {{with regard to}} the inheritance of family businesses. Tax exemptions result from the belief that the burden of the inheritance tax might force <b>family-owned</b> <b>companies</b> to shut down the business. This is especially presumed when a company is facing a sudden death of its ceo. Yet, up to now, {{only a limited number of}} studies provide evidence for this specific reason of default. In this paper we test how fragile Flemish family businesses are at the moment of a forced transfer of the family firm, using survey data and accounting records for 273 <b>family-owned</b> <b>companies.</b> The ability to pay inheritance taxes is proxied by the liquid assets and the available and tax-free reserves. The analysis shows that if both liquid assets and tax-free reserves are taken into account, maximum 8, 4 % of the <b>family-owned</b> <b>companies</b> in the sample will face serious difficulties when confronted with the unforeseen decease of the ceo...|$|R
