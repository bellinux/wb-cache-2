2500|$|While all bishops are {{attached}} to a congregation (in the sense that {{every member of the}} church has a home congregation), bishops are not congregational officers, but preside as financial officers over larger jurisdictions, or support those who do. For example, each mission center will have a bishop in charge of all the finances of that area, {{who may or may not}} be assisted by other bishops. Likewise, some nations have a national bishop, and, historically, stakes also had bishops. Consequently, this makes the office of bishop somewhat uncommon. In recent years, some mission centers have had multiple bishops in order to help promote the various ministries associated with <b>good</b> <b>stewardship.</b>|$|E

50|$|However, {{towards the}} end of the 1980s, Thatcher's {{increasing}} unpopularity and unwillingness to change policies perceived as vote-losing led to her being deposed in 1990 and replaced by John Major who won an unexpected election victory in 1992.

40|$|Manure in an {{inevitable}} {{byproduct of the}} production of meat and milk destined for human consumption. Excessive excretion of manure and manure nutrients represent inefficiencies which increase feed costs, increase {{the environmental impact of}} dairy farming, and increase the costs associated with moving and storing manure.

Furthermore, <b>good</b> environmental <b>stewardship</b> will maintain the generally good image the public has of dairy farming. Society is becoming increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of manure and manure nutrients. In response, the federal government and many states have developed environmental rules regulating certain dairy farms (EPA, 2003). Although regulations vary, the amount of P and N excreted via manure are of major regulatory importance. The selection of proper feed ingredients and diet formulation can affect the mass of manure produced and the amount of specific nutrients (e. g., N and P) that are excreted. MANURE PRODUCTIO...|$|R

40|$|The {{long-term}} {{viability of the}} vegetable industry in NYS {{is dependent on the}} health of its soils. <b>Good</b> soil <b>stewardship</b> requires knowledge about a wide range of soil health issues and the practices that affect them. To improve their soil management capabilities, farmers, agribusiness professionals and extension educators need better tools for monitoring the physical, chemical and biological health of soils. They also need training in the use of these tools, and in the interpretation of results from soil health monitoring activities. Those who manage soils also need more information about the impact of specific practices on soil health. The leadership of this project is comprised of members of the Soil Health PWT. We will develop a soil health monitoring protocol and demonstrate its use to extension educators and farmers in five pilot regions in the state. We will also assess the soil health status of several indicator farms in each of these regions...|$|R
