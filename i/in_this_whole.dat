Kenneth Young comments that the British government's involvement of the Queen inadvertently strengthened the post-UDI authorities' position; outraged, many in Rhodesia who had heretofore rejected UDI now threw their weight behind the RF.

Sarah Stegall of SFScope called the episode an homage to X-Files episode [...] "D.P.O.", whose featured character has a similar premise to Meegar. Stegall admitted that [...] "this show is growing on me," [...] with the same atmosphere as The X-Files [...] "coupled with a slightly better grounding in actual science." [...] Erin Dougherty of Cinema Blend reacted positively towards the episode, commending it as it [...] "bounced back so quickly from that lame silver cylinder episode or they would've lost me forever." [...] Dougherty also felt that the three protagonists, Olivia, Walter and Peter, [...] "are becoming much more believable characters." [...] Noel Murray of The A.V. Club rated the episode a B−, opining that the cold open was the series' best since the pilot, but added that [...] "despite the added [...] sympathy, 'Power Hungry' promptly peters out, because the level of oddity required for Walter and the Pattern Team to track the Freak down isn't especially high." [...] Murray added that the return of Scott and his scenes with Olivia [...] "serves to string along the home viewer, inviting us to question whether Olivia's playing for the right team <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> Pattern game." [...] Television Without Pity meanwhile, graded the episode with an A−.|$|E

500|$|After The Game {{signed with}} the G-Unit, he {{recorded}} nine songs with fellow American rapper 50 Cent in his home studio in Farmington, Connecticut, {{and then went back}} to Los Angeles, California to complete the album with American record producer Dr. Dre. While continuing the recording sessions on the album, he began working with rapper and record producer Kanye West on a song, where Kanye did the chorus. However, the song was left on the cutting room floor. The Game also was working on the album for his inspiration goals about reviving {{what it felt like to}} be involved <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> hip hop scene in the West Coast, which was overshadowed over these past few years by these artists between the East to the South. In 2005, in the interview with Vibe magazine, 50 Cent stated that he was brought in by the Interscope Records to work on the album, claiming that was on the verge of being shelved and The Game was being dropped from the label. However, in the interview with Funkmaster Flex, The Game said that his status was never uncertain that he would be dropped from the label. 50 Cent also claimed that he wrote six songs of The Documentarys eighteen tracks—"Hate It or Love It", [...] "How We Do", [...] "Church for Thugs", [...] "Special", [...] "Higher", and [...] "Westside Story"—and didn't receiving any proper credit for his work. The Game denied those claims, saying that 50 Cent only wrote two songs on the album.|$|E
500|$|In mid-2007, McEntire {{announced}} {{the release of}} her twenty-fifth studio album, , on September 18. McEntire stated that {{out of all the}} albums she had previously recorded, her newest release was particularly special: [...] "This is an album that will {{go down in history as}} probably my favorite album to record because I got to work and sing and be with my friends. Out of everything <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> career that I can say that I'm the most proud of, are my friends. And here's the proof." [...] In promotion for the album, McEntire made appearances at radio shows and on The Oprah Winfrey Show September 19. The album's lead single, [...] "Because of You"—a duet with Kelly Clarkson, who originally recorded the song—became her fifty-fifth Top 10 single on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, tying her with Dolly Parton, who also had the same amount of Top 10 records. The album was given high critical praise from magazines such as PopMatters, which called McEntire's vocals, [...] "to sound sweet without being syrupy, while being extremely powerful. McEntire's vocal strength yields a different kind of authority than the bluesy, drawling growl of Janis Joplin, the weathered rasp of Marianne Faithfull, or even the soul-shrieking powerhouse of Tina Turner. Instead, Reba's voice combines the aspects of all three singers but tempers it with a Southern sweetness and an unmistakable femininity." [...] The album contained ten tracks of duets with country and pop artists, including Kenny Chesney, LeAnn Rimes, Trisha Yearwood, Carole King, and Justin Timberlake. Reba: Duets peaked at No. 1 on the Top Country Albums chart, while also becoming her first album in her thirty-year career to peak and debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, with 300,536 copies (according to Nielsen Soundscan) sold within its first week of release. On January 17, 2008, McEntire embarked on the 2 Worlds 2 Voices Tour with Clarkson, which began in Fairborn, Ohio and ended in November of the same year. A month after its release, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on October 19, 2007. The album's only other single was [...] "Every Other Weekend". Recorded on the album as a duet with Chesney, it was released to radio with its co-writer, Skip Ewing, as a duet partner.|$|E

2500|$|In {{all these}} ways – the {{organization}} of the new police, the new Poor Law, and in the new municipal councils – the pattern of government in England was changed fundamentally within a single decade. [...] In conjunction with the removal of religious disabilities, these reforms laid the structural foundation for a new kind of State in Britain: a State in which the electoral rights and civil rights of citizens were extended and given greater legal protection, but in which the ordinary citizen was subjected to a much greater degree of administrative interference, direction, and control from the centre. [...] The most spectacular element <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> process – the Reform Bill of 1832 – ensured that the state should also be partially democratized at the centre. [...] The full significance of 1832 {{in the history of the}} country is appreciated only if it is seen as the central change in this mini-sided transformation of an agricultural nation ruled by squires, parsons, and the wealthy landowners into an industrial nation dominated by the classes produced by industrial expansion and commercial enterprise.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{gave the}} film very mixed to {{negative}} reviews. The Hollywood Reporter wrote, [...] "This family film {{is willing to}} tackle important issues such as burgeoning sexuality, alcoholism and a troubled home life but does so in a bland and unconvincing story." [...] However, the film's technical qualities were praised. Both The Hollywood Reporter and the St. Paul Pioneer Press felt the story was slow and contrived. The Los Angeles Times called the film flawed, and placed the blame squarely on the screenplay for not knowing whether to depict a Disney-esque innocent adventure or a real world that confronted a teenager's emerging sexuality, a father's alcoholism, and the break-up of a marriage. The Deseret News called the film [...] "hokey" [...] and felt the direction {{and some of the}} performances were amateurish. The newspaper labeled the score as [...] "one of the worst musical scores in recent memory", and felt the period songs were [...] "ill-chosen". The Minneapolis Star Tribune was particularly harsh in its criticism. The newspaper felt the picture was [...] "insulting to your child's intelligence, veer wildly between broad humor (and I should mention that there is literally not one funny scene <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> movie), sugary nostalgia and the worst melodrama", and [...] "fraught with leaden direction and horrible acting".|$|E
2500|$|A {{rapporteur}} on piracy for the Assembly of the Western European Union {{and former}} {{commander of the}} Estonian Defence Forces Tarmo Kõuts {{was quoted in the}} Estonian newspaper Postimees as saying, [...] "Only the presence of cruise missiles on board the ship can explain Russia's strange behavior <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> story." [...] He noted that the size of the naval unit sent out after MV Arctic Sea was larger than that dispatched to deal with the Somalian piracy crisis. According to a widely circulated theory, the ship was transporting anti-aircraft weapons and cruise missiles destined for Iran, and the [...] "hijackers" [...] were gangsters hired by the Israeli intelligence service Mossad to prevent the cargo from reaching its destination. Referring to an earlier article in Russia's Komsomolskaya Pravda, The Independent reported that an unnamed general in the Russian Navy spoke of his suspicion that Russian organized crime was illegally shipping S-300 or Kh-55 missiles to Iran. A variation of the story suggested that the Russian government itself had staged the hijacking of the ship once it learned about an unsanctioned missile delivery to the Middle East. Specifically, Mossad was reported to have been tracking the shipment, and, as BBC News reported, informed Russian authorities that the ship was transporting a [...] "Russian air defence system for Iran." [...] The S-300 missiles allegedly were loaded on board when the ship stopped in Kaliningrad.|$|E

2500|$|During {{his tenure}} on the court, Voelker wrote over 100 opinions, both {{majority}} opinions and dissents. In 1958, he authored {{what was the}} originally the dissent in the case People v. Hildabridle. That case centered around a nudist colony near Battle Creek. Local police on their own initiative investigated the colony even though local residents had not lodged any complaints. One officer swore out a warrant used to arrest the colony members. Chief Justice John R. Dethmers wrote the original majority opinion to uphold the convictions of the nudists. In the dissent, Voelker proclaimed [...] "the entire search-and-arrest process 'indecent—indeed the one big indecency we find <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> case .... It seems {{that we are now}} prepared to burn down the house of constitutional safeguards in order to roast a few nudists. I will have none of it." [...] In an example of the humor used in his opinions, in noting the proclivities of the nudist, [...] "if eccentricity were a crime, then all of us were felons." [...] This dissenting opinion was so convincing that it swayed Justice George Clifton Edwards, Jr., one of those in the majority, to change sides, converting the dissent to a majority. On Voelker's request, his opinion was published unaltered, starting with the words [...] "I dissent", an anomaly in published majority opinions of the court. In 1962, political scientist S. Sidney Ulmer noted that Voelker was the second-most influential member of the court in his short tenure.|$|E
2500|$|If {{the early}} 2nd century dating of the 52 {{is in fact}} correct, then {{the fact that the}} {{fragment}} is from a codex rather than a scroll would testify to the very early adoption of this mode of writing amongst Christians, {{in stark contrast to the}} apparent practice of contemporary Judaism. Furthermore, an assessment of the length of 'missing' text between the recto and verso readings corresponds with that in the counterpart canonical Gospel of John; and hence confirms that there are unlikely to have been substantial additions or deletions <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>whole</b> portion. Other than two iotacisms (ΗΜΕΙΝ, ΙΣΗΛΘΕΝ), and in the probable omission of the second ΕΙΣ ΤΟΥΤΟ from line 2 of the verso, 52 agrees with the Alexandrian text base. In lines 4 and 5 of the recto the reconstructed text reads ΠΑΛΙΝ ΕΙΣ ΤΟ ΠΡΑΙΤΩΡΙΟΝ Ο ΠΙΛΑΤΟΣ in agreement with 66 and with the Codex Vaticanus whereas the Codex Sinaiticus, Codex Alexandrinus and the Majority Text all have the alternative word order; ΕΙΣ ΤΟ ΠΡΑΙΤΩΡΙΟΝ ΠΑΛΙΝ Ο ΠΙΛΑΤΟΣ, but this is hardly a significant variant. Since this fragment is small [...] about nine by six centimetres [...] it cannot be proven that it comes from a full copy of the John that we know; but it may be presumed that the original text was at least of near full gospel length to be worth the extra care and time required in writing in codex form. [...] On the other hand, the generous scale and format of the codex pages of 52 are such that it is highly unlikely that it could originally have comprised the four canonical gospels; Roberts calculated that such a codex might have required 576 pages.|$|E
