5|$|In {{response}} to demands for more aircrew to meet Australia's commitments to the Korean War and Malayan Emergency, flying {{training in the}} RAAF was again expanded in 1951–52, resulting in the functions of No.1 FTS being split among three separately located units. No.1 FTS itself was renamed No.1 Applied Flying Training School (No.1 AFTS) in March 1952, and assumed responsibility for advanced weapons and combat training on CAC Wirraways. Meanwhile, in November 1951, No.1 Initial Flying Training School (No.1 IFTS) was raised at RAAF Station Archerfield, Queensland, to impart students with general aeronautical and military knowledge, after which they received their flight grading during twelve <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> de Havilland Tiger Moths. Graduate pilots of No.1 IFTS went on to another new unit, No.1 Basic Flying Training School (No.1 BFTS) at RAAF Base Uranquinty, New South Wales, where they underwent further aerial instruction that included instrument, formation and night flying, as well as aerobatics and navigation. The first part of their training at No.1 BFTS included 40 <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> Tiger Moths, after which they would fly 50 <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> Wirraways. Successful students finally transferred to No.1 AFTS, before graduating as sergeant pilots.|$|E

5|$|Accordingly, {{protective}} measures {{were taken in}} response. To save the transformers and other electrical equipment, the power grid {{was taken out of}} commission, as circuit breakers tripped all over Quebec and shut off the power. Within less than 90 seconds, this wave of breaking circuits left the entire transmission grid out of service. The collapsed power grid left six million people and the rest of Quebec without electricity for <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> a very cold night. Even though the blackout lasted around nine hours for most places, some locations were in the dark for days. This geomagnetic storm caused about C$10 million in damage to Hydro-Québec and tens of millions to the customers of the utility.|$|E
5|$|Admiral Hipper {{left the}} Norwegian theater in September 1940 for an {{overhaul}} in Wilhelmshaven. After the routine maintenance was completed {{toward the end}} of the month, the ship attempted to break out into the Atlantic Ocean to raid merchant traffic. The engine oil feed system caught fire and was severely damaged. The fire forced the crew to shut down the ship's propulsion system until the blaze could be brought under control; this rendered Admiral Hipper motionless for several <b>hours</b> <b>on</b> the open sea. British reconnaissance failed to locate the ship, and after the fire was extinguished, the ship returned to Hamburg's Blohm & Voss shipyard, where repairs lasted slightly over a week.|$|E
5|$|After {{being sent}} toward the Moon by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts {{separated}} the spacecraft {{from it and}} traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit.

The astronauts used Eagles upper stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned Eagle before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out of lunar orbit on a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean on July 24.|$|E
