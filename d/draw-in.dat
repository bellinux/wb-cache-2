The <b>draw-in</b> sensor was developed based on the mutual inductance principle and provided linear results between the <b>draw-in</b> of the tested sheet metal and the induced voltages. The <b>draw-in</b> sensor was tested to simulate the stamping environment. To validate the experimental results, the <b>draw-in</b> sensor tests were compared to both the analytical and the simulation methods and the results were in agreement. Currently, the <b>draw-in</b> sensor is being implemented in a hydraulic stamping press to observe the functionality and accuracy of the <b>draw-in</b> sensor. This paper identifies a new approach to process monitoring in stamping processes by embedding force sensors into the stamping tooling structure. It is aimed to detect stamping process defects through identifying patterns of forming pressure variations. Towards this end experiments were conducted on a stamping test-bed equipped with an array of force sensors. Measurements from the spatially distributed sensors were used to numerically interpolate the pressure distribution at any point on the tooling surface by Thin Plates Splines. The combined accuracy of the physical sensing system and the surface generation technique has been estimated by comparing press force calculated from numerical integration of the TPS determined pressure surfaces with direct measurements.

40|$|Abstract. Sheet {{metal forming}} {{is one of}} the major {{processes}} in manufacturing and is broadly used due to its high degree of design flexibility and low cost. In the sheet metal forming process, <b>draw-in</b> (planar movement of a sheet periphery) frequently occurs and {{is one of the}} most dominated indicators on the success of a forming process. Currently, monitoring and controlling <b>draw-in</b> during each stamping operation requires either time-consuming setup or a significant die modification. Most devices have been used only in laboratory settings. Our goal is to design a <b>draw-in</b> sensor providing high sensitivity in monitoring; ease of setup, measurement and controlling; and eventually be implemented in industry. Our design is based on the mutual inductance principle, which we considered physical factors affecting the characteristics of the <b>draw-in</b> sensor. Two different configurations, single-transducer and double-transducer of our <b>draw-in</b> sensors have been designed and tested. The results showed good linearity, especially for the double-transducer case. The output of the <b>draw-in</b> sensor was affected by the type of sheet metal, dimension of the transducer, and the distance between the transducer and the testing sheet metal. It was found that the result was insensitive to the waviness of the sheet metal if sheet thickness was thin. The invention, implementation, and integration of the <b>draw-in</b> sensor will have an enormous impact on revolutionizing the control of stamping process, will provide solid ground for process variation and uncertainty studies, and ultimately will affect the design decision process...|$|E

OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate the}} ability of elite football players with and without low back pain (LBP) to voluntarily <b>draw-in</b> the abdominal wall. BACKGROUND: While there has been considerable debate regarding {{the contribution of the}} transversus abdominis (TrA) muscle to control the lumbar spine and pelvis, there is evidence that retraining motor control of the deep trunk muscles is commensurate with decreases in LBP. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to assess the TrA muscle during the <b>draw-in</b> maneuver, with the contraction of the TrA muscle reducing the circumference of the trunk. Impairments in performance of the <b>draw-in</b> maneuver have been shown in people with LBP. METHODS: Forty-three elite players from a team in the Australian Football League were allocated to 3 groups: those with "no LBP," "a history of LBP but no current LBP," or "current LBP. " MRI was used to image the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the trunk {{at the level of the}} L 3 - 4 disc at the start and end of the <b>draw-in</b> maneuver.

A series of springs are used to locally apply in-plane tension through clamps to the fibre preform to control material <b>draw-in.</b> The optimisation procedure seeks to minimise local in-plane shear angles by determining the optimum location and size of constraining clamps, and the stiffness of connected springs. Results are presented for a double-dome geometry, which are validated against data from the literature. Controlling material <b>draw-in</b> using in-plane constraints around the blank perimeter is an effective way of homogenising the global shear angle distribution and minimising the maximum value.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{deformation}} {{of the press}} and the forming tools during a deep drawing process is small. However, it has a significant influence on the formed product, since the <b>draw-in</b> is affected significantly by this deformation. This effect is demonstrated for the cross-die forming process. The process was simulated using the commercial code ABAQUS, comparing different models for the forming tools and blank. The simulated process behaves quite differently when rigid or deformable tools are applied. In the latter case, so-called tool-spacers absorb {{a significant part of the}} blankholder load, resulting in a stronger <b>draw-in</b> of the blank. In all cases, the results depended heavily on the blank element type and on numerical settings for the contact algorithm. These should be treated with great care when accurate results are required...|$|E

40|$|The bond {{behaviour}} of novel, sand-coated ultra-high modulus (UHM) {{carbon fibre}} reinforced polymers (CFRP) tendons to high performance concrete (HPC) was studied {{by a combined}} numerical and experimental approach. A series of pull-out tests revealed that the failure type can vary between sudden and continuous pull-out depending on the chosen sand coating grain size. Measuring the same shear stress vs. tendon <b>draw-in</b> (τ-δ) curves in the same test set-up, for sand coated CFRP tendons with a longitudinal stiffness of 137 and 509 GPa, respectively, indicated that the absolute bond strength in both cases was not influenced by the tendon’s stiffness. However, the τ-δ curves significantly differed {{in terms of the}} <b>draw-in</b> rate, showing higher <b>draw-in</b> rate for the UHM CFRP tendon. With the aid of X-ray computed tomography (CT), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and visual analysis methods, the bond failure interface was located between the CFRP tendon and the surrounding sand-epoxy layer. For further investigation, a simplified finite element analysis (FEA) of the tendon pull-out was performed using a cohesive surface interaction model and the software Abaqus 6. 14. A parametric study, varying the tendon-related material properties, revealed the tendon’s longitudinal stiffness to be the only contributor to the difference in the τ-δ curves found in the experiments, thus to the shear stress transfer behaviour between the CFRP tendon and the concrete. In conclusion, the excellent bond of the sand-coated UHM CFRP tendons to HPC as well as the deeper insight in the bond failure mechanism encourages the application of UHM CFRP tendons for prestressing applications...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} is in two parts, theory and experimental verification. (1) Theoretical Study In this study it is, for obvious reasons, necessary to analyse {{the concept of}} formability first. For {{the purpose of the}} present investigation it is sufficient to define the four aspects of formability as follows: (a) the formability of the material at a critical section, (b) the formability of the material in general, (c) process efficiency, (d) proportional increase in surface area. A method of quantitative assessment is proposed for each of the four aspects of formability. The theoretical study also includes the distinction between coaxial and non-coaxial strains which occur, respectively, in axisymmetrical and unsymmetrical forming processes and the inadequacy of the circular grid system for the assessment of formability is explained in the light of this distinction. (2) Experimental Study As one of the bases of the experimental work, the determination of the end point of a forming process, which sets the limit to the formability of the work material, is discussed. The effects of three process parameters on <b>draw-in</b> are shown graphically. Then the delay of fracture in sheet metal forming resulting from <b>draw-in</b> is analysed in kinematical terms, namely, through the radial displacements, the radial and the circumferential strains, and the projected thickness of the workpiece. Through the equilibrium equation of the membrane stresses, the effect on the shape of the unsupported region of the workpiece, and hence the position of the critical section is explained. Then, the effect of <b>draw-in</b> on the four aspects of formability is discussed throughout this investigation. The triangular coordinate system is used to present and analyse the triaxial strains involved. This coordinate system has the advantage of showing all the three principal strains in a material simultaneously, as well as representing clearly the many types of strains involved in sheet metal work...|$|E
