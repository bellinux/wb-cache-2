60|$|She {{began to}} be alarmed. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>widened</b> in fear. All sorts of vague horrors sprang unbidden into her brain. She still had the mist of sleep in her brain.|$|E
6000|$|She had put {{her hand}} up to her breast, her face was colourless, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>widened</b> by alarm. Then seeming to master herself, she {{inclined}} her head, and said: [...] "Very well." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>widened</b> just a line, {{but they}} did not waver. [...] "I should like to hear from you," [...] she said cordially. [...] "I'd like {{to know what you think}} of those pamphlets, which I'll surely send." ...|$|E
60|$|Lady Cicely reads, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>widen</b> and <b>her</b> voice chokes with horror.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pan! Pan!" [...] she cried, {{and moved}} toward him, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>widening,</b> shining with a light {{he had never seen}} in another woman's.|$|R
50|$|When Nene sees Jojo, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>widen</b> and <b>her</b> heart {{seems to}} have dropped.But when Jojo {{tried to talk to}} her, nothing else came out of her but anger.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is Cliff!" [...] {{she cried}} out. [...] "He's on our trail!" [...] And {{into her face}} came a look of alarm. Her lips paled, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>widened.</b> [...] "He's mad--he's dangerous! Leave him to me," [...] she added, in a low, tense voice.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>widened.</b> Her gaze deepened. She clipped her {{forefinger}} in sign of agreement. [...] "It {{was very}} cold {{up there in}} winter. We were often hungry, for the game had all been driven to the plain and we could not follow. Many of our children died. All died but one." ...|$|E
60|$|A {{woman was}} {{watering}} flowers {{at the edge}} of a lawn. She straightened up as his team of horses came near. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>widened</b> in astonishment--and then fear. Her mouth fell open in a soundless O and her sprinkling can slipped from her fingers and rolled silently onto the lawn.|$|E
6000|$|He added this {{question}} in a soothing tone, as he saw <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>widening</b> sorrowfully, and {{the corners of her}} mouth falling. She said nothing at first; she only opened her apron and looked down at her apricots and sweetmeats. Then she looked up at him again and said complainingly-- ...|$|R
60|$|The lady {{started as}} {{she gazed at}} me, and <b>her</b> tired <b>eyes</b> <b>widened.</b> She {{clutched}} Mr. Riddle's arm.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Harding {{sinks into}} a chair. He keeps {{shivering}} and saying, [...] "I tell you, I can't; I can't. She wouldn't understand." [...] The letter is fluttering in his hand. His face is contemptible. He does it splendidly. Lady Cicely picks {{the letter from}} his hand. She reads it aloud, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>widening</b> as she reads: ...|$|R
60|$|As its import dawned upon her, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>widened</b> {{at first}} in {{surprise}} and then narrowed as {{she realized the}} value of her discovery. At first she placed the letter back with the others {{just as she had}} found them, but on second thought she took it up quickly and, folding it, slipped it inside her waist. Then she returned to Compton's office.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't want such compliments! And, oh!" [...] {{and here}} <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>widened</b> with fright, [...] "what shall I do? He only said my {{feelings}} did me honour, {{and he would}} be patient and convince me. Oh, Colonel Keith, what shall I do?" [...] and she looked almost afraid that fate and perseverance would master her after all, and that she should be married against her will.|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>widened</b> with {{surprise}} {{when she saw}} who the visitor was, and she put a finger to her lip {{and pointed to the}} sleeper. And, as we have to record another of the long list of Steve's failures to propose we may say here, in excuse, that this reception took {{a great deal of the}} edge off the dashing resolution which had been his up to that moment. It made him feel self-conscious from the start.|$|E
60|$|The rising {{tears were}} checked by terror at {{this change in}} Tito's voice. Tessa turned very pale, and sat in {{trembling}} silence, with <b>her</b> blue <b>eyes</b> <b>widened</b> by arrested tears.|$|R
60|$|Victoria's {{answer was}} a little cry which startled him, and drew his look to her. She had touched her horse with the whip, and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> had <b>widened</b> in real alarm.|$|R
60|$|Then as {{she turned}} toward me, evidently with a word of {{explanation}} on <b>her</b> lips, <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> suddenly <b>widened</b> as they rested upon me, and with a little exclamation she started toward me.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Her</b> bright <b>eyes</b> <b>widened</b> to {{an almost}} {{electric}} glare; and yet it seemed rather bewilderment than confusion or fear. [...] "Why, what can you mean?" [...] she cried. [...] "All the servants {{were out of the}} house, seeing the theatricals. And we don't keep a butler, thank goodness!" ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the head}} of each line of guardsmen, nearest the chancel and upon {{either side of the}} bridal party, the ranks were formed of {{commissioned}} officers. Butzow was among them. He, too, {{out of the corner of}} his eye watched the advancing figure. Suddenly he noted the limp, and gave a little involuntary gasp. He looked at the Princess Emma, and saw <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> suddenly <b>widen</b> with consternation.|$|R
60|$|Miriam {{looked at}} him, <b>her</b> large black <b>eyes</b> <b>widening</b> and kindling. For an instant she felt for her poniard--and then burst into an agony of tears, hid {{her face in}} her {{withered}} hands, and rushed from the room, as a crash and shout below announced the bursting of the door.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> were <b>widening,</b> darkening with thought, and {{whenever}} {{they did so}} the steady, watchful, seeing gaze gave place to the wistful light. In the former she saw as the primitive woman without thought; in the latter she looked inward, and her gaze was the reflection of a troubled mind. For long Venters had not seen that dark change, that deepening of blue, which he thought was beautiful and sad. But now {{he wanted to make}} her think.|$|R
6000|$|He had {{forgotten}} where he sat, {{but he was}} not neglecting his hostess. He took a satanic satisfaction in seeing <b>her</b> lovely <b>eyes</b> <b>widen</b> and glow as he went on. Subtly flattering her by including her among the very few who could understand his ideals, he seemed to draw her apart to his side--appealing to her for support against the coarse and foolish hosts represented by the Mosses, while Marshall Haney sat in a kind of stupor, his eyes alone speaking, as if to ask: [...] "What the divil is the little man with the cough so hot about?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dah--now you's fixed." [...] She propped {{the child}} {{in a chair and}} stood off to inspect it. Straightway <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> begun to <b>widen</b> with astonishment and admiration, and she clapped her hands and cried out, [...] "Why, it do beat all! I never knowed you was so lovely. Marse Tommy ain't a bit puttier--not a single bit." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>widened</b> <b>eyes</b> {{stared at}} the paper. Mr. Blunt threw {{one of the doors}} open, but before we passed through it we heard a petulant exclamation {{accompanied}} by childlike stamping with both feet and ending in a laugh which had in it a note of contempt.|$|R
50|$|At this point, {{lead singer}} Dero enters {{disguised}} as a clown, although with no bright or colorful makeup, rather black lipstick and eyeliner and black clothing with a priest's collar. He smirks briefly at twin girls by the doorway and the twins' eyes flash black for a moment. He then proceeds to perform magic tricks for the party guests, however the tricks are not particularly astounding and rather this sequence features him with a handkerchief in his mouth, smiling demonically at the children whilst the adults applaud enthusiastically. Dero continues to smile freakishly as he gestures for the birthday boy's mother to come closer. He blindfolds her and spins her in a circle, much like she were about to play Blind man's bluff or a similar game. The boy's mother begins to walk forwards into the small crowd of children, who are watching her. Trying to feel her way with her hands outstretched, the mother wanders into a small windowless cell, where her son is standing. He is holding a small gift-wrapped box, perhaps one of his birthday gifts. His mother removes her blindfold and <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>widen</b> in fear {{at the sight of}} her son standing there. What happens to her from then is unknown, however there is a short split-second shot of her hand limply dropping the blindfold she was holding.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> blue <b>eyes</b> <b>widened</b> with tears, and {{she said}} nothing. Tito was afraid of {{something}} worse than ridicule, if he were seen in the Via de' Bardi with a girlish contadina looking pathetically at him. It was a street of high silent-looking dwellings, not of traffic; but Bernardo del Nero, or some one almost as dangerous, might come up at any moment. Even {{if it had not}} been the day of his betrothal, the incident would have been awkward and annoying. Yet it would be brutal--it was impossible--to drive Tessa away with harsh words. That accursed folly of his with the cerretano--that it should have lain buried in a quiet way for months, and now start up before him as this unseasonable crop of vexation! He could not speak harshly, but he spoke hurriedly.|$|R
5000|$|Once {{again in}} his [...] "oblong box", Sir Edward is resurrected by a vengeful N'Galo, {{but this time he}} is six feet under with no hope of escape. While back at the Markham mansion, Julian is occupying his brother's old room, where he is {{beginning}} to show the first signs of the voodoo curse. His wife Elizabeth learns this when she tells him about his brother's room: Julian then says, [...] "It is now my room". She is flushed with fear of his disfigurment and the film (with credits) closes with a close up of <b>her</b> <b>widened</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|Although Victoria {{said this}} very simply, the mother's <b>eyes</b> <b>widened</b> until one might almost {{have said they}} {{expressed}} a kind of terror.|$|R
60|$|Pantaloon's great countenance grew pale, {{his little}} <b>eyes</b> <b>widened</b> to their fullest extent as he conned {{the face of}} his companion. Then he exploded.|$|R
60|$|But he {{was quite}} dumb. She fetched him a sharp slap on the face. He started, and his <b>eyes</b> <b>widened.</b> Then his face darkened with defiance, after all.|$|R
6000|$|Jeb Case's {{jaw dropped}} and his <b>eyes</b> <b>widened.</b> [...] "You're {{in the wrong}} pasture, bub," [...] he remarked feelingly. [...] "What yer lookin' fer is Sears, Roebuck & Company." ...|$|R
60|$|He stopped. His china-blue <b>eyes</b> <b>widened.</b> His {{shoulders}} shot {{forward to}} a rigid stoop of astonishment. His mouth opened. He gasped as they ran to join the gathering crowd.|$|R
6000|$|The girl's <b>eyes</b> <b>widened</b> {{with awe}} of the big, silent, dark world he indicated. [...] "Aren't you afraid to start out on such a trip alone--I mean, don't you dread it?" ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{no doubt}} or {{hesitation}} about the date this time. It was grappled to his memory by hoops of steel owing to the singular coincidence of it being also his telephone number. He gave {{it out with a}} roll, and the girl's <b>eyes</b> <b>widened.</b>|$|R
6000|$|That, old mare, {{at sight}} whereof your wise <b>eyes</b> <b>widen</b> till {{they are ready}} to burst, and your ears are first shot forward towards your nose, and then laid back with vicious intent. Stand still, old woman! Do you think still, after fifteen winters, that you can catch a fox? ...|$|R
