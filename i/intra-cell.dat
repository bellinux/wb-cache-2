50|$|Once dry, {{the plates}} are stacked with {{suitable}} separators and inserted {{in a cell}} container. The alternate plates then constitute alternating positive and negative electrodes, and within the cell are later connected to one another (negative to negative, positive to positive) in parallel. The separators inhibit the plates from touching each other, which would otherwise constitute a short circuit. In flooded and gel cells, the separators are insulating rails or studs, formerly of glass or ceramic, and now of plastic. In AGM cells, the separator is the glass mat itself, and the rack of plates with separators are squeezed together before insertion into the cell; once in the cell, the glass mats expand slightly, effectively locking the plates in place. In multi-cell batteries, the cells are then connected {{to one another in}} series, either through connectors through the cell walls, or by a bridge over the cell walls. All <b>intra-cell</b> and inter-cell connections are of the same lead alloy as that used in the grids. This is necessary to prevent galvanic corrosion.|$|E

However, the complexity of such a joint receiver makes it impossible to implement in practice using current computational capabilities. In this direction, this paper investigates the capacity performance of reduced-complexity communication schemes in order to evaluate their performance with respect to the optimal multicell joint decoding scheme. More specifically, two sub-optimal schemes are considered: 1) <b>intra-cell</b> user orthogonalization combined with optimal multicell joint decoding and 2) <b>intra-cell</b> user orthogonalization combined with linear MMSE filtering and single-user decoding. The employed cellular multiple-access channel model incorporates flat fading, path loss, distributed users and multiple antennas at the Base Station, while both peak and average transmit power constraints are taken into account. In this context, it is shown that linear MMSE filtering combined with multiple BS antennas and <b>intra-cell</b> orthogonalization can still provide a considerable capacity enhancement.

40|$|Abstract: In the {{infrastructure}} configuration, the standard IEEE 802. 11 wireless LAN employs an access point (AP) to forward all packets {{regardless of their}} destinations, resulting in significant system performance degradation in terms of throughput and packet delay when {{a significant portion of}} packets have <b>intra-cell</b> destinations. These <b>intra-cell</b> packets could be more efficiently delivered to the destinations directly in an ad-hoc manner. In this paper, we propose methods to seamlessly integrate such ad-hoc operations into {{the infrastructure}} mode. By inserting a 2 β delay in the frame exchange sequence, the proposed 2 β Ad-hoc Awareness Direct Connection (2 β AHADC) scheme brings ad-hoc awareness to the infrastructure setting and minimizes the number of packets forwarded by the AP. Furthermore, a Direct Cut-Through Forwarding (DCTF) scheme is introduced to minimize the <b>intra-cell</b> packet forwarding delay. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methods by theoretical analysis and simulations. Numerical results show that in systems with significant fraction of <b>intra-cell</b> packets, the DCTF and 2 β AHADC schemes effectively reduce packet delays and increase system throughput. The proposed methods extend the capability and performance of existing standards in a backward compatible manner, by introducing minor modifications that do not require explicit mode switching or extra modules...|$|E
40|$|Local {{instability}} {{in the form of}} "intra-cell buckling" or "dimpling" is a well-known failure mode in honeycomb-cored sandwich panels with very thin faces. Most work reported on the subject suggests relatively simple design formulae for the estimation of the <b>intra-cell</b> buckling load. It is however widely known that these classical design formulae in some cases considerably underpredict the <b>intra-cell</b> buckling load. In this paper a series of experimental results obtained for different CFRP/honeycomb sandwich panel configurations loaded in compression are presented. The results confirm that the "classical" design formulae provide overly conservative results. During the tests the <b>intra-cell</b> buckling patterns were monitored carefully, and it was observed that the hitherto assumed buckling patterns did not correspond to the experimental observations. Based on these findings a new simplified design formula is suggested, which for the investigated CFRP/honeycomb sandwich panels provides significantly more accurate predictions than the "classical" design formulae...|$|E
40|$|Fault {{management}} {{is a crucial}} part of cellular network management systems. The status of the base stations is usually monitored by well-defined key performance indicators (KPIs). The approaches for cell degradation detection are based on either <b>intra-cell</b> or inter-cell analysis of the KPIs. In <b>intra-cell</b> analysis, KPI profiles are built based on their local history data whereas in inter-cell analysis, KPIs of one cell are compared with the corresponding KPIs of the other cells. In this work, we argue in favor of the inter-cell approach and apply a degradation detection method that is able to detect a sleeping cell that could be difficult to observe using traditional <b>intra-cell</b> methods. We demonstrate its use for detecting emulated degradations among performance data recorded from a live LTE network.
