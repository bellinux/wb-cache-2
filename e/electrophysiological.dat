5|$|Anderson {{and colleagues}} from St Thomas' Hospital, London, {{were the first}} to mention a case with {{possible}} clinical findings of LEMS in 1953, but Lambert, Eaton, and Rooke at the Mayo Clinic were the first physicians to substantially describe the clinical and <b>electrophysiological</b> findings of the disease in 1956. In 1972, the clustering of LEMS with other autoimmune diseases led to the hypothesis that it was caused by autoimmunity. Studies in the 1980s confirmed the autoimmune nature, and research in the 1990s demonstrated the link with antibodies against P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channels.|$|E
5|$|In the 2013, the perturbational {{complexity}} index (PCI) was proposed, {{a measure}} of the algorithmic complexity of the <b>electrophysiological</b> response of the cortex to transcranial magnetic stimulation. This measure was shown to be higher in individuals that are awake, in REM sleep or in a locked-in state than in those who are in deep sleep or in a vegetative state, making it potentially useful as a quantitative assessment of consciousness states.|$|E

25|$|Some Lepidoptera species eat {{many of the}} Senecio genus; {{additional}} studies via <b>electrophysiological</b> recordings {{have shown that the}} taste sensilla of the Cinnabar moth larvae respond (get excited) specifically to the pyrrolizidine alkaloids, which all Senecio are known to contain.|$|E
25|$|Visual field defects {{had been}} {{reported}} as early as 1997 by Tom Eke and others, in the UK. Some authors, including Comaish et al. believe that visual field loss and <b>electrophysiological</b> changes may be demonstrable in up to 50% of Vigabatrin users.|$|E
25|$|Depolarization Induced Suppression Of Inhibition is the {{classical}} and original <b>electrophysiological</b> example of endocannabinoid {{function in the}} central nervous system. Prior to the demonstration that Depolarization Induced Suppression Of Inhibition was dependent on the cannabinoid CB1 receptor function, {{there was no way}} of producing an in vitro endocannabinoid mediated effect.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{diagnostic}} tools {{can also}} be used to help determine the extent of dysgeusia. <b>Electrophysiological</b> tests and simple reflex tests may be applied to identify abnormalities in the nerve-to-brainstem pathways. For example, the blink reflex may be used to evaluate the integrity of the trigeminal nerve–pontine brainstem–facial nerve pathway, which may play a role in gustatory function.|$|E
25|$|Another protein, auxin-binding protein 1 (ABP1), is a {{putative}} receptor for {{a different}} signaling pathway, but its role is as yet unclear. <b>Electrophysiological</b> experiments with protoplasts and anti-ABP1 antibodies suggest ABP1 may have a function at the plasma membrane, and cells can possibly use ABP1 proteins to respond to auxin through means faster and independent of gene expression.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, CR {{cells in}} the {{marginal}} zone {{were found to have}} <b>electrophysiological</b> fingerprints. Whole-cell patch-clamp studies (the laboratory technique in electrophysiology allowing the study of single or multiple ion channels in cells) showed that CRN injected by a suprathreshold depolarizing current pulse express a repetitive firing mode and cells injected by a hyperpolarizing current pulse, express a hyperpolarization-activated inward current (H-current).|$|E
25|$|While an EEG based brain-computer {{interface}} has been pursued extensively {{by a number}} of research labs, recent advancements made by Bin He and his team at the University of Minnesota suggest the potential of an EEG based {{brain-computer interface}} to accomplish tasks close to invasive brain-computer interface. Using advanced functional neuroimaging including BOLD functional MRI and EEG source imaging, Bin He and co-workers identified the co-variation and co-localization of <b>electrophysiological</b> and hemodynamic signals induced by motor imagination.|$|E
25|$|The first {{discovered}} FHM locus was the CACNA1A gene (originally named CACNL1A4), which encodes the P/Q-type calcium channel CaV2.1. There are currently 17 known mutations in this channel, see Table 1, and these mutations are {{distributed throughout the}} channel. Some of these mutations result in patients with notable cerebellar degeneration or other dysfunction. 15 of these mutants have received at least some further analysis at the <b>electrophysiological</b> level to attempt to determine how they might lead to the FHM1 phenotype. There is increasing contradiction in the literature as to {{the end result of}} these mutations on channel kinetics and neuronal excitability.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been found that there are gender {{differences}} {{between males and females}} in regards to visual memory and sleep. In a study done testing sleep and memory for pictures it was found that daytime sleep contributed to retention of source memory rather than item memory in females, females did not have recollection or familiarity influenced by daytime sleep, whereas males undergoing daytime sleep had a trend towards increased familiarity. The reasons for this may be linked to different memory traces resulting from different encoding strategies, as well as with different <b>electrophysiological</b> changes during daytime sleep.|$|E
25|$|In general, PPS is a {{diagnosis}} of exclusion whereby other possible causes of the symptoms are eliminated. Neurological examination aided by other laboratory studies can help to determine what component of a neuromuscular deficit occurred with polio and what components are new and to exclude all other possible diagnoses. Objective assessment of muscle strength in PPS patients may not be easy. Changes in muscle strength are determined in specific muscle groups using various muscle scales which quantify strength, such as the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), neuroimaging, and <b>electrophysiological</b> studies, muscle biopsies, or spinal fluid analysis may also be useful in establishing a PPS diagnosis.|$|E
25|$|The final type of GEFS+ {{is caused}} by {{mutations}} in the SCN2A gene, which encodes a sodium channel α subunit. The first associated mutation in this gene is R187W, located on the intracellular region linking membrane spanning units two and three in the first domain (D1S2-S3, figure 3). Patients with this mutation have both febrile and afebrile seizures. <b>Electrophysiological</b> examination of this mutant revealed that it increases the time constant for inactivation, presumably increasing sodium current and leading to hyperexcitability. However, this mutation also yields channels that inactivate at more hyperpolarized potentials relative to wild-type channels, indicative of hypoexcitability. Whether the end result on membrane excitability of this mutation is hyperexcitability or hypoexcitability is, as yet, unclear.|$|E
25|$|GABAA agonists, usually {{diazepam}} {{but sometimes}} other benzodiazepines, {{are the primary}} treatment for SPS. Drugs that increase GABA activity alleviate muscle stiffness caused {{by a lack of}} GABAergic tone. They increase pathways that are dependent upon GABA and have muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant effects, often providing symptom relief. Because the condition worsens over time, patients generally require increased dosages, leading to more side effects. For this reason, gradual increase in dosage of benzodiazepines is indicated. Baclofen, a GABAB agonist, is generally used when individuals taking high doses of benzodiazepines have high side effects. In some cases it has shown improvements in <b>electrophysiological</b> and muscle stiffness when administered intravenously. Intrathecal baclofen administration may not have long-term benefits though, and there are potential serious side effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{other form}} of {{activity}} during sleep is reactivation. Some <b>electrophysiological</b> {{studies have shown that}} neuronal activity patterns found during a learning task before sleep are reactivated in the brain during sleep. This, along with the coincidence of active areas with areas responsible for memory have led to the theory that sleep might have some memory consolidation functions. In this relation, some studies have shown that after a sequential motor task, the pre-motor and visual cortex areas involved are most active during REM sleep, but not during NREM. Similarly, the hippocampal areas involved in spatial learning tasks are reactivated in NREM sleep, but not in REM. Such studies suggest a role of sleep in consolidation of specific memory types. It is, however, still unclear whether other types of memory are also consolidated by these mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|Increases in vagal {{activities}} to the SA node decreases the firing {{rate of the}} pacemaker cells by decreasing {{the slope of the}} pacemaker potential (phase 4 of the action potential); this decreases heart rate (negative chronotropy). The change in phase 4 slope results from alterations in potassium and calcium currents, as well as the slow-inward sodium current that is thought to be responsible for the pacemaker current (If). By hyperpolarizing the cells, vagal activation increases the cell's threshold for firing, which contributes to the reduction in the firing rate. Similar <b>electrophysiological</b> effects also occur at the AV node; however, in this tissue, these changes are manifested as a reduction in impulse conduction velocity through the AV node (negative dromotropy). In the resting state, there is a large degree of vagal tone on the heart, which is responsible for low resting heart rates.|$|E
25|$|The axon is a finer, cable-like {{projection}} {{that can}} extend tens, hundreds, or even {{tens of thousands}} of times the diameter of the soma in length. The axon carries nerve signals away from the soma (and also carries some types of information back to it). Many neurons have only one axon, but this axon may—and usually will—undergo extensive branching, enabling communication with many target cells. The part of the axon where it emerges from the soma is called the axon hillock. Besides being an anatomical structure, the axon hillock is also the part of the neuron that has the greatest density of voltage-dependent sodium channels. This makes it the most easily excited part of the neuron and the spike initiation zone for the axon: in <b>electrophysiological</b> terms, it has the most negative action potential threshold. While the axon and axon hillock are generally involved in information outflow, this region can also receive input from other neurons.|$|E
25|$|These studies {{suggested}} that lamotrigine acts presynaptically on voltage-gated sodium channels to decrease glutamate release. Several <b>electrophysiological</b> studies {{have investigated the}} effects of lamotrigine on voltage-dependent sodium channels. For example, lamotrigine blocked sustained repetitive firing in cultured mouse spinal cord neurons in a concentration-dependent manner, at concentrations that are therapeutically relevant {{in the treatment of}} human seizures. In cultured hippocampal neurons, lamotrigine reduced sodium currents in a voltage-dependent manner, and at depolarised potentials showed a small frequency-dependent inhibition. These {{and a variety of other}} results indicate that the antiepileptic effect of lamotrigine, like that of phenytoin and carbamazepine, is at least in part due to use- and voltage-dependent modulation of fast voltage-dependent sodium currents. However, lamotrigine has a broader clinical spectrum of activity than phenytoin and carbamazepine and is recognised to be protective against generalised absence epilepsy and other generalised epilepsy syndromes, including primary generalised tonic–clonic seizures, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Between 1974 and 1985 Persinger {{pursued the}} {{properties}} of brain mast cells and their responsiveness to environmental stimuli. He considered brain function {{to be the result}} of a matrix of anatomical structures. During the 1980s and 1990s he studied the relationships between changes in behavior and multi-focal brain anomalies associated with complex partial and limbic epilepsy and the emergence of sensitivities to stimuli typically not detected. Linda St-Pierre and he showed that the interaction between specific psychotropic drugs and limbic epilepsy in rodents contributed significantly to obesity. Nicolas Rouleau and he demonstrated that fundamental <b>electrophysiological</b> properties of the human brain were still evident in chemically fixed, post-mortem samples when appropriate neurochemicals were added or if the tissues were electrically stimulated. After 2000 he, Blake T. Dotta, Nirosha J. Murugan, and Lukasz M. Karbowski pursued the mechanisms by which temporally complex magnetic fields with specific point durations tuned to proton properties slowed the growth of cancer cells but not normal cells, a continuation of the original research by Carly A. Buckner and Robert M. Lafrenie.|$|E
500|$|Although {{aphasiology}} is {{the historical}} core of neurolinguistics, {{in recent years}} the field has broadened considerably, {{thanks in part to the}} emergence of new brain imaging technologies (such as PET and fMRI) and time-sensitive <b>electrophysiological</b> techniques (EEG and MEG), which can highlight patterns of brain activation as people engage in various language tasks; <b>electrophysiological</b> techniques, in particular, emerged as a viable method for the study of language in 1980 with the discovery of the N400, a brain response shown to be sensitive to semantic issues in language comprehension. [...] The N400 was the first language-relevant brain response to be identified, and since its discovery EEG and MEG have become increasingly widely used for conducting language research.|$|E
500|$|Since {{one of the}} focuses of {{this field}} is the testing of {{linguistic}} and psycholinguistic models, the technology used for experiments is highly relevant {{to the study of}} neurolinguistics. Modern brain imaging techniques have contributed greatly to a growing understanding of the anatomical organization of linguistic functions. [...] Brain imaging methods used in neurolinguistics may be classified into hemodynamic methods, <b>electrophysiological</b> methods, and methods that stimulate the cortex directly.|$|E
500|$|Another area of {{neurolinguistics}} literature {{involves the}} use of <b>electrophysiological</b> techniques to analyze the rapid processing of language in time. [...] The temporal ordering of specific patterns of in brain activity may reflect discrete computational processes that the brain undergoes during language processing; for example, one neurolinguistic theory of sentence parsing proposes that three brain responses (the ELAN, N400, and P600) are products of three different steps in syntactic and semantic processing.|$|E
500|$|In many {{neurolinguistics}} experiments, subjects do {{not simply}} sit {{and listen to}} or watch stimuli, but also are instructed to perform some sort of task {{in response to the}} stimuli. [...] Subjects perform these tasks while recordings (<b>electrophysiological</b> or hemodynamic) are being taken, usually {{in order to ensure that}} they are paying attention to the stimuli. At least one study has suggested that the task the subject does has an effect on the brain responses and the results of the experiment.|$|E
500|$|Reich was {{influenced}} by the work of the Austrian internist Friedrich Kraus, who argued in his paper Allgemeine und Spezielle Pathologie der Person (1926) that the biosystem was a relay-like switch mechanism of electrical charge and discharge. Reich wrote in an essay, [...] "Der Orgasmus als Elektro-physiologische Entladung" [...] ("The Orgasm as an <b>Electrophysiological</b> Discharge", 1934), that the orgasm is just such a bioelectrical discharge and proposed his [...] "orgasm formula": mechanical tension (filling of the organs with fluid; tumescence) → bioelectrical charge → bioelectrical discharge → mechanical relaxation (detumescence).|$|E

2500|$|After {{attending}} a Society for Neuroscience symposium (Toronto, 1988), organized by John Lisman on mechanisms of hippocampal plasticity, Silva decided to study hippocampal-dependent memory formation. The compelling properties of calcium calmodulin kinase II, {{one of the}} topics discussed in that symposium, and an elegant model by John Lisman proposing a key role for that kinase in hippocampal learning and memory, persuaded Silva to refocus his project in the Tonegawa laboratory {{on the role of}} the alpha calcium calmodulin kinase II in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and learning & memory. [...] The two articles he published in Science as a post-doctural fellow in Susumu Tonegawa's laboratory were the first to combine molecular genetic techniques with <b>electrophysiological</b> analyses and behavioral studies.
