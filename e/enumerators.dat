These polynomials take a particularly simple form for self-dual codes: in this case there are just two of them, the two bivariate polynomials x2+y2 and x8+14x2y2+y8. Gleason's student Jessie MacWilliams continued Gleason's work in this area, proving {{a relationship between the}} weight <b>enumerators</b> of codes and their duals that has become known as the MacWilliams identity.|$|E
5|$|To that point, {{the federal}} government, through Elections Canada, assumed {{responsibility}} for ensuring that every eligible elector was registered for each electoral event.

5|$|The census {{enumeration}} {{was carried}} out from 16 October to 15 November 2010 by 25,000 school leavers and 8,400 census supervisors deputed by the Census Statistical Office of Zambia. Civil servants from various government departments trained the <b>enumerators.</b> There were two forms: Form A, which had basic details like full name, sex, membership status, expected to be answered by senior members of each household; Form B which had details about individual members of the family. When the respondent was a minor, proxy members having knowledge about the family were questioned. The details in form B were not sufficiently captured in the forms answered by the proxy members, most of whom did not have full information about all the family members. All buildings that were complete, incomplete, abandoned, habitable or inhabitable were accounted by the <b>enumerators.</b> Compared to the form used during 2000 census enumeration, there were additional details on death of household members, maternal deaths, albimism, orphanhood and fosterhood in the forms used in 2010. The enumeration was completed by 15 November 2010 for majority of the regions, while all the remaining {{regions of the country}} were completed by 30 November 2010. A total of 3.2 million questionnaires were used for data collection and the Central Statistical Office started processing the forms from April 2011. OMR and ICR technologies were used for data processing.|$|E

If this first replacement was also unsuccessful, the <b>enumerator</b> would select the household next door to that one.

5|$|Walker {{accepted}} a re-appointment as {{the superintendent of}} the 1880 Census because a new law, spearheaded by Congressman James A. Garfield, had been passed {{to allow him to}} appoint trained census <b>enumerators</b> free from political influence. Notably, the 1880 Census's results suggested population throughout the Southern states had increased improbably over Walker's 1870 census but an investigation revealed that the latter had been inaccurately enumerated. Walker publicized the discrepancy even as it effectively discredited the accuracy his 1870 work. The tenth Census resulted in the publication of twenty-two volumes, was popularly regarded as the best census of any up to that time, and definitively established Walker's reputation as the preeminent statistician in the nation. The Census was again delayed {{as a result of its}} size and was the subject of praise and criticism on its comprehensiveness and relevance. Walker also used the position as a bully pulpit to advocate for the creation of a permanent Census Bureau to not only ensure that professional statisticians could be trained and retained but that the information could be better popularized and disseminated. Following Garfield's 1880 election, there was wide speculation that he would name Walker to be Secretary of the Interior, but Walker had accepted the offer to become President of MIT in the spring of 1881 instead.|$|E
25|$|The {{decennial census}} {{has been the}} method of {{collecting}} United Kingdom-wide population-based statistics since 1801. Currently the UK census is governed by the Census Act 1920. However, prior to 1841 it {{was no more than}} a headcount. Since 1841, except in 1941 when no census took place due to the Second World War, detail was gathered about the household. Until the 1901 the <b>enumerators</b> were responsible for completing census enumerator sheets, transcribing the details included in household schedules completed by the head of the household. From the 1911 census onwards an individual census form, provided by and returned to an enumerator, was completed by the head of the household and became the primary source of demographic data. In 2001 census returns were for the first time sent out by post, but were collected by <b>enumerators.</b> The 2011 UK Census was the first time, individual census forms were issued through the Royal Mail and could also be returned by post, except in Scotland where instead they were collected by <b>enumerators.</b> Census forms could also be completed and submitted through the internet by the householder. In recent times, combined with other data, the ten-yearly census has provided the basis of socio-economic statistics used by all branches of national and local government, the Public Services and the private sector.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the complexity of}} enumerative approximation of two elementary problems in linear algebra, computing the rank and the determinant of a matrix. In particular, we show that if there exists an <b>enumerator</b> that, given a matrix, outputs a list of constantly many numbers, {{one of which is}} guaranteed to be the rank of the matrix, then it can be determined in AC (with oracle access to the <b>enumerator)</b> which of these numbers is the rank. Thus, for example, if the <b>enumerator</b> is an FL function, then the problem of computing the rank is in FL. The result holds for matrices over any commutative ring whose size grows at most polynomially with the size of the matrix. The existence of such an <b>enumerator</b> also implies a slightly stronger collapse of the exact counting logspace hierarchy...|$|R
40|$|Many {{research}} in coding theory is focussed on linear error-correcting codes. Since these codes are subspaces, linear algebra plays {{a prominent role}} in studying them. An important polynomial invariant of linear error-correcting codes is the (extended) weight <b>enumerator.</b> The weight <b>enumerator</b> gives information about the probability of undetected errors in error-detection, and about the probability of decoding errors in bounded distance decoding. Furthermore, the extended weight <b>enumerator</b> is equivalent to the Tutte polynomial of the matroid associated to the code. Linear codes are closely connected to hyperplane arrangements: the columns of the generator matrix of a code can be viewed as the coordinates of a hyperplane arrangement over a finite field. Using this correspondence, the problem of determining the extended weight <b>enumerator</b> can be transformed into a counting problem on a hyperplane arrangement. In fact, the extended weight <b>enumerator</b> is equivalent to the coboundary polynomial (or two-variable characteristic polynomial) of the associated hyperplane arrangement. In this talk, we will examine this application of hyperplane arrangements to weight enumeration in more detail. The practical use of the theory will be motivated by several examples...|$|R

Specifically, we give an expression for the reversed sum <b>enumerator</b> for x-parking functions in terms of inversions in rooted plane trees with respect to certain admissible vertex orders.
