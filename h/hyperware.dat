In 2000, <b>HyperWare</b> was spun back out from Quantum3D {{with the help}} of external investors. After the investors pulled out in late 2002 and <b>HyperWare</b> shut down, Foley hired back the core staff and revived the platform under the UltraCade Technologies banner. In late 2005, the sale of UltraCade Technologies to Global VR was initiated but did not complete.

As of May 2012 the terms of the sale to Global VR have not been satisfied and the transaction not completed.|$|E
