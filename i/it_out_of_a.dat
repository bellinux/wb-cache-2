5|$|Process {{theology}} {{argues that}} God is not omnipotent: rather than coercion, {{he has the}} power of divine persuasion, but he cannot force his will. Griffin, a prominent process theologian, argues that God feels {{the pain of the}} world (both physically and emotionally) and does everything within his power to achieve good, but he can neither force beings to be good nor prevent evil because he does not play a coercive role in the world. Process theology teaches that, rather than creating the world ex nihilo (as Augustine proposed), God created <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pre-existent chaos.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneously, an {{unrelated}} movement of communal singing was established throughout the South and Western states. A format of teaching music to illiterate people appeared in 1800. It used four sounds {{to symbolize the}} basic scale: fa-sol-la-fa-sol-la-mi-fa. Each sound {{was accompanied by a}} specifically shaped note and thus became known as shape note singing. The method was simple to learn and teach, so schools were established throughout the South and West. Communities would come together for an entire day of singing in a large building where they sat in four distinct areas surrounding an open space, one member directing the group as a whole. Most of the music was Christian, but the purpose of communal singing was not primarily spiritual. Communities either could not afford music accompaniment or rejected <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Calvinistic sense of simplicity, so the songs were sung a cappella.|$|E

Snow blowers typically clear much faster than plows, with some clearing in excess of [...] of snow per hour, and can cut through far deeper snow drifts than a snowplow can. In addition, snow blowers can remove snow from the roadway completely, rather than piling it at the side of the road, making passage easier for other road users and preventing the windrow from blocking driveways.|$|E

She calls the number, pretends to be the Jamaican dental receptionist, and asks the man to come back to see Dr. Kaplan. At the appointed time, she returns to the dentist's office, but does not recognize anyone there; so she calls the number again. When the man (Michael Sheen) answers, she sees him and hangs up. Unbeknownst to Liz, her number is already listed in his cellphone under [...] "future wife". He calls her back upon seeing she called, and they arrange a date; she learns that his name is Wesley. On their date, the two fail to hit it off: they find each other annoying and share many flaws but few interests. Later, at the 30 Rock studios, Liz discovers that Wesley was the person who retrieved NBC page Kenneth Parcell's (Jack McBrayer) wallet, after Kenneth threw <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> window earlier. Because of this coincidence, Liz and Wesley decide to go on another date.|$|E

500|$|From a cricketing viewpoint, most critics {{agreed that}} D'Oliveira should {{probably}} have been selected based on his score at the Oval, his past record, and the usefulness of his bowling. The selectors left him out, however, deciding that his bowling was {{not strong enough to}} classify him as an all-rounder. Oborne points out that, judged in cricketing terms, this was [...] "not an outrage". D'Oliveira had several rivals as a batsman, and of the places available, one went to Ken Barrington, who had a good Test record, and the other to Keith Fletcher, who was much younger than D'Oliveira. Oborne judges both of these decisions fair. Nobody at the selection meeting supported including D'Oliveira. Some of those present said later that, despite his prior assurances to D'Oliveira, Cowdrey opposed his selection at the meeting, which influenced others there. Fraser-Sampson suggests that Cowdrey, who later tried to justify his role in events, may have inwardly supported D'Oliveira's inclusion, but spoken against <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lack of confidence and decisiveness. It is also possible, argues Fraser-Sampson, that if May had been aware of the true state of affairs, he may have confided in Cowdrey, a close friend; this would have left Cowdrey, who was very keen to lead a team to South Africa, in a difficult and conflicted position. Fraser-Sampson concludes: [...] "Far from being the villain of the piece, Cowdrey may simply have been an honourable man pushed beyond the limits of his character and overwhelmed by events." ...|$|E

2500|$|... ("On the Virgin Conception and Original Sin") {{was written}} in 1099. He claimed to have written <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> desire to expand on an aspect of Cur Deus Homo for his student and friend Boso and {{takes the form of}} Anselm's half of a {{conversation}} with him. Although Anselm denied belief in Mary's Immaculate Conception, his thinking laid two principles which formed the groundwork for that dogma's development. The first is that it was proper that Mary should be so pure that—apart from God—no purer being could be imagined. The second was his treatment of original sin. Earlier theologians had held that it was transmitted from generation to generation by the sinful nature of sex. As in his earlier works, Anselm instead held that Adam's sin was borne by his descendants through the change in human nature which occurred during the Fall. Parents were unable to establish a just nature in their children which they had never had themselves. This would subsequently be addressed in Mary's case by dogma surrounding the circumstances of her own birth.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1943, together with Adam Chalupec, Mirosław Iringh organized the [...] "Underground Slovak National Committee" [...] (SKN), which made contact with {{the representatives of the}} Home Army, and established civilian and military relations. At the end of 1943 an agreement was reached between the SKN and the Home Army command, which called for the formation of a separate Slovak military unit within the structure of the Home Army - Platoon 535. The unit was to be distinguished by armbands and a regimental standard in Slovak national colors, white-blue-red, as opposed to the red and white colors {{of the rest of the}} Home Army soldiers. Iringh's armband was made by the wife of one of the Polish members of SKN, Jadwiga Szantarek-Szczudłowska. She sewed <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> French broad riband military decoration which had been bestowed on her husband (Col. Mieczysław Szczudłowski) by Marshal Foch - the colors of the French flag are the same as that of the Slovak one.

2500|$|Initially, {{the basic}} {{policies}} outlined by President Kennedy in {{a message to}} Congress on March 28, 1961, guided McNamara in the reorientation of the defense program. Kennedy rejected the concept of first-strike attack and emphasized the need for adequate strategic arms and defense to deter nuclear attack on the United States and its allies. U.S. arms, he maintained, must constantly be under civilian command and control, and the nation's defense posture had to be [...] "designed to reduce the danger of irrational or unpremeditated general war." [...] The primary mission of U.S. overseas forces, in cooperation with allies, was [...] "to prevent the steady erosion of the Free World through limited wars". Kennedy and McNamara rejected massive retaliation for a posture of flexible response. The U.S. wanted choices in an emergency other than [...] "inglorious retreat or unlimited retaliation", as the president put <b>it.</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> major review of the military challenges confronting the U.S. initiated by McNamara in 1961 came a decision to increase the nation's [...] "limited warfare" [...] capabilities. These moves were significant because McNamara was abandoning President Dwight D. Eisenhower's policy of massive retaliation {{in favor of a}} flexible response strategy that relied on increased U.S. capacity to conduct limited, non-nuclear warfare.|$|E
2500|$|In 1746, Bertram {{composed}} {{a letter to}} the English antiquarian William Stukeley on Gram's recommendation. He hesitated sending it and Stukeley did not receive it until 11 June 1747. He found it [...] "full of compliments, as usual with foreigners", and his reply brought a [...] "prolix and elaborate Latin epistle" [...] from Gram in Bertram's favour. Gram was widely known and respected in English universities. After a few further letters, Bertram mentioned [...] "a manuscript in a friend's hands of Richard of Westminster,... a history of Roman Brittain... and an antient map of the island annex'd." [...] He eventually [...] "confessed" [...] that another Englishman, [...] "wild in his youth, had stolen <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> larger manuscript in an English Library", permitting its use to Bertram upon his promise of secrecy. Stukeley was considering retirement but, receiving a new position in London and hearing of Gram's death, he renewed the correspondence and received a [...] "copy" [...] of its script made by Bertram. David Casley, the keeper of the Cotton Library, [...] "immediately" [...] described it as around 400 years old. Stukeley thereafter always treated Bertram as reliable. He [...] "press'd MrBertram to get the manuscript into his hands, if possible... as the greatest treasure we now can boast of in this kind of learning." [...] Bertram refused his attempts to purchase the original manuscript for the British Museum, but Stukeley had received copies of the text piecemeal over a series of letters and had a version of the map by early 1750. Poste notes that the volume appeared in no manuscript catalogues of the era but offered {{that it could have been}} stolen at the time of the Cotton Library's fire in 1732. There had been a monk named Richard at Westminster Abbey in the mid-15th century and Bertram suggested this date to Stukeley. Stukeley preferred instead to identify Bertram's [...] "Richard of Westminster" [...] with Richard of Cirencester, who had lived at Westminster in the late 14th century and was known to have compiled another history. Stukeley made the text and map available at the Arundel Library of the Royal Society.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second part}} of the book is written from the {{perspective}} of Jacob Black, a werewolf who had also fallen in love with Bella. A month after the wedding, Bella calls her father, Charlie Swan, and says that she is sick. Charlie relays this to Billy Black, Jacob's father, and Billy relays it to the pack. Jacob thinks that Bella is now a vampire and attempts to lead an assault on the Cullens for breaking the treaty. When he arrives, he discovers that Bella is sick, but it is from her pregnancy, not a disease. Jacob begs Bella to abort the fetus and save her life, but Bella is determined that she will live long enough to have the baby and be transformed into a vampire. Jacob runs off in his werewolf form and keeps thinking of what Bella had said. This accidentally reveals Bella's condition to the pack, and because they think the baby will become a monster, the pack decides to kill the baby and Bella immediately. Jacob refuses, and when Sam uses an alpha command to force Jacob, Jacob accepts his bloodline as the true leader of the pack and breaks free of Sam's control. He runs off to warn the Cullens of the pack's plan to kill Bella. However, while en route, Seth Clearwater, one of the younger pack members, joins Jacob and makes note of the fact that neither of them can hear the others' thoughts and that they had formed their own pack. They warn the Cullens and take up patrol around the Cullens' property. Leah, Seth's older sister, joins them shortly afterward. After a chance remark by Jacob, they discover that the baby simply craves blood, and Bella has to drink <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cup for the greatest effectiveness. Bella gets better, but the fetus grows swiftly and the timing of birth is unknown {{due to the lack of}} any related medical knowledge on human-vampire births. Carlisle, the experienced doctor, is out of the house to replenish blood supplies from a hospital blood bank when Bella falls, detaching the placenta and inducing labor. The baby breaks many of her bones, including her spine, and she loses massive amounts of blood. In order to save her life, Edward changes her into a vampire by injecting his venom into her heart. Jacob, thinking that Bella is dead, and blaming Bella's daughter Renesmee as the cause, tries to kill Renesmee. Instead, he [...] "imprints"—an involuntary response in which a shape-shifter finds his soul mate—on her.|$|E
