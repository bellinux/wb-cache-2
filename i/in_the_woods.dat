5|$|A tabloid {{paper offers}} a $10,000 reward for the tiger causing {{the town to}} be {{inundated}} with hunters and reporters. The sheriff forbids anyone from going <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> and hunting the tiger, but while out with Deputy Sharon Weinman (Sarah Constible), he sees Roy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods.</b> They give chase, but instead find a dead tabloid reporter. The National Guard is called in to help. The sheriff later sees Roy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> again and warns him to stay out before taking him home and giving Rose the same warning.

The estimated share of <b>the</b> shadow economy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> industry is 21. 7 %. As the basic solutions to reduce {{the share of the}} shadow economy and to speed up the dynamics of the entering of small enterprises <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> industry are improved regulation system to provide better incentives to operate within the formal sector and better access for necessary financial capital at acceptable guarantees. As important are also good practices by the state institutions by providing incentives for entrepreneurship and encouraging decisions for the setting up of an enterprise...|$|R

Doggett returns to the woman <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods</b> who watches over the creature; after recoiling at its ugliness, the woman explains that it looks {{the way it does}} because it takes the sickness of others into itself, while healing them in the process.

Later, Doggett awakens in the tunnels. In the dark corner of the cavern, the woman kneels beside the dead soul eater.

5|$|Frederick's army became {{bogged down}} in the Reppen Forest. The day was already hot and sultry, and the men were already tired. The trees were thick and the ground was {{unstable}} and oozy in some parts, which made {{the movement of the}} heavy guns difficult. Delay after delay slowed them down. The carriages pulling the biggest guns, traveling with the bulk of the army, were too wide to cross the narrow forest bridges and the columns had to be reshuffled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods.</b> The Russians could hear them, but thought they were scouting parties, albeit noisy ones; they calculated Finck's column was the primary force. Between 5:00 am. and 6:00 am., only Finck's demonstrating corps, to the north by Trettin, were visible to the Russians. Finck's right wing moved out of the hills toward the mill on Hühner Fleiss; more Prussians from Finck's left and center prepared to attack the Walkberge. Finck's artillery awaited Frederick's signal, but the bulk of Frederick's army still crashed about <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>woods.</b>|$|E
