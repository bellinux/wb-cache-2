25|$|There {{are many}} {{proteins}} that bind to microtubules, including the motor proteins kinesin and dynein, severing proteins like katanin, and other proteins important for regulating microtubule dynamics. Recently an actin-like protein {{has been found}} in a <b>gram-positive</b> <b>bacterium</b> Bacillus thuringiensis, which forms a microtubule-like structure and is involved in plasmid segregation.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{derivative}} of gramicidin, {{produced by the}} <b>gram-positive</b> <b>bacterium</b> Bacillus brevis. Gramicidin S is a cyclodecapeptide, constructed as two identical pentapeptides joined head to tail, formally written as cyclo(-Val-Orn-Leu-D-Phe-Pro-)2. That is to say, it forms a ring structure composed of five different amino acids, each one used twice within the structure. Another interesting point is that it utilizes two amino acids uncommon in peptides: ornithine {{as well as the}} atypical stereoisomer of phenylalanine. It is synthesized by gramicidin S synthetase.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, a pigment {{compound}} {{isolated and}} characterized from fruit bodies of Mycena aurantiomarginata was reported as new to science by Robert Jaeger and Peter Spiteller in the Journal of Natural Products. The chemical, mycenaaurinA, is a polyene compound {{that consists of}} a tridecaketide (i.e., 13 adjacent methylene bridge and carbonyl functional groups with two amino acid [...] on {{either end of the}} molecule). The authors posit that the flanking amino acid groups are probably derived biosynthetically from S-Adenosyl methionine. The tridecaketide itself contains an alpha-pyrone, a conjugated , and a single alkenyl moiety. Jaeger and Spiteller suggest that mycenaaurinA might function as a defense compound, since it exhibits antibacterial activity against the <b>Gram-positive</b> <b>bacterium</b> Bacillus pumilus. The chemical is only present in the fruit bodies, and not in the colorless mycelia. An earlier screening for antimicrobial activity in the fruit bodies revealed a weak ability to inhibit the growth of the fungi Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus.|$|E

2500|$|Gram-positive cell {{walls are}} thick and the {{peptidoglycan}} ( [...] {{also known as}} murein) layer constitutes almost 95% of the cell wall in some <b>gram-positive</b> <b>bacteria</b> and as little as 5-10% of the cell wall in gram-negative <b>bacteria.</b> The <b>gram-positive</b> <b>bacteria</b> take up the crystal violet dye and are stained purple. The cell wall of some <b>gram-positive</b> <b>bacteria</b> can be completely dissolved by lysozymes which attacks the bonds between GA and MA. In other <b>gram-positive</b> <b>bacteria,</b> such as Staphylococcus aureus, the walls are resistant to the action of lysozymes. They have O-acetyl groups on carbon-6 of some MA residues.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIt {{has long}} been {{accepted}} that <b>Gram-positive</b> <b>bacteria</b> resist the membrane attack complex (MAC) because of a protective, thick peptidoglycan layer (Joiner et al. 1983). However, this is contradicted by reports showing that MAC components are assembled on <b>Gram-positive</b> <b>bacteria</b> in specific localizations and that this assembly differs among bacterial strains (Berends et al. 2013). Also, MAC components’ deficiency increases patients’ susceptibility to infections not only with Gram-negative but also with some <b>Gram-positive</b> <b>bacteria</b> (Skattum et al. 2011). Moreover, many <b>Gram-positive</b> <b>bacteria</b> not only recruit the host inhibitors of MAC but also express proteins that inhibit MAC formation (Laursen et al. 2010). For example, Streptococcus pyogenes secretes streptococcal inhibitor of complement, which blocks the C 5 b- 7 membrane insertion site and thereby prevents MAC formation (Akesson et al. 1996). This shows clearly that the peptidoglycan wall {{is not enough to}} protect all <b>Gram-positive</b> <b>bacteria</b> from MAC lysis...|$|R
2500|$|The SRP RNA spans a wide phylogenetic {{spectrum}} {{with respect}} to size {{and the number of}} its structural features (see the SRP RNA Secondary Structure Examples, below). The smallest functional SRP RNAs have been found in mycoplasma and related species. Escherichia coli SRP RNA (also called 4.5S RNA) is composed of 114 nucleotide residues and forms an RNA stem-loop. The <b>gram-positive</b> <b>bacterium</b> Bacillus subtilis encodes a larger 6S SRP RNA which resemble the Archaeal homologs but lacks SRP RNA helix 6. Archaeal SRP RNAs possess helices 1 to 8, lack helix 7, and are characterized by a tertiary structure which involves the [...] loops of helix 3 and helix 4. The eukaryotic SRP RNAs lack helix 1 and contain a helix 7 of variable size. Some protozoan SRP RNAs have reduced helices 3 and 4. The ascomycota SRP RNAs have an altogether reduced small domain and lack helices 3 and 4. The largest SRP RNAs known to date are found in the yeasts (Saccharomycetes) which acquired helices 9 to 12 as insertions into helix 5, as well as an extended helix 7. Seed plants express numerous highly divergent SRP RNAs.|$|E

50|$|Gram {{staining}} differentiates bacteria by {{the chemical}} and physical properties of their cell walls by detecting peptidoglycan, which {{is present in the}} cell wall of <b>Gram-positive</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Gram-negative cells also contain peptidoglycan, but a very small layer of it that is dissolved when the alcohol is added. This is why the cell loses its initial colour from the primary stain. <b>Gram-positive</b> <b>bacteria</b> retain the crystal violet dye, and thus are stained violet, while the Gram-negative bacteria do not; after washing, a counterstain is added (commonly safranin or fuchsine) that will stain these Gram-negative bacteria a pink color. Both <b>Gram-positive</b> <b>bacteria</b> and Gram-negative bacteria pick up the counterstain. The counterstain, however, is unseen on <b>Gram-positive</b> <b>bacteria</b> because of the darker crystal violet stain.|$|R

50|$|This {{section will}} review the drug {{development}} {{from one generation to}} the next with emphasis on the structural differences between the generations.

From the first generation cephalosporins to the third generation there is a development from being more effective against <b>gram-positive</b> <b>bacteria</b> to being more effective against gram-negative bacteria and less effective against <b>gram-positive</b> <b>bacteria</b> respectively.
