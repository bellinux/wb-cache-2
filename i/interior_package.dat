5|$|The Jaguar XJ220 Pininfarina is {{a special}} XJ220 built in 1995 for the Sultan of Brunei and his brother Prince Jefri, who {{commissioned}} a number of rare and one-off heavily modified cars based on expensive luxury cars. This car was modified by Pininfarina, with modifications including fixed headlights, new rear lights with a redesigned double-vane rear wing, and a new <b>interior</b> <b>package.</b> The car also comes with dark green exterior paint.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after stylists penned {{the first}} design sketches, Holden {{engineers}} {{began work on}} developing the chassis. Opel, which had {{provided the basis for}} all previous Commodore generations, ceased production of their rear-wheel drive Omega in 2003. This meant that Holden had two options: to use another GM platform, or to develop an all-new vehicle. GM's new premium rear-wheel drive Sigma platform was to see production in the 2002 Cadillac CTS. Holden's engineers were offered this platform, but decided it was not appropriate. The Sigma platform's double A-arm front suspension and extensive use of aluminium were too costly for the VE's market segment. The luggage compartment was deemed too small and the Sigma <b>interior</b> <b>package</b> could not be stretched sufficiently to become a family-sized car. In particular, the rear-seat shoulder width was too tight. These major drawbacks made Holden decide to develop an all-new platform, known as the GM Zeta platform, on which a number of forthcoming GM vehicles will also be based. The Zeta suspension system comprises new double-pivot MacPherson strut for the front and a four-link independent rear setup. These replace the previous simple MacPherson strut design front and much criticised semi-trailing arm rear suspension, for improved ride and handling.|$|E

5000|$|As {{with the}} {{location}} of other automotive design [...] "hard points," [...] the H-point has major ramifications in the overall vehicle design, including roof height, aerodynamics, visibility (both within the vehicle and from the vehicle into traffic), seating comfort, driver fatigue, ease of entry and exit, <b>interior</b> <b>packaging,</b> safety, restraint and airbag design and collision performance. As an example, higher H-points can provide more legroom, both {{in the front and}} back seats.|$|R

50|$|Vehicle {{interior}} ergonomics {{are integral}} to an automotive design education. The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) has adopted tools for vehicle design, including statistical models for predicting driver eye location and seat position {{as well as}} an H-point mannequin for measuring seats and <b>interior</b> <b>package</b> geometry. See SAE J86 for a description of the H-point machine. H-Point machines have been built by Technosports of Livonia, Michigan.
