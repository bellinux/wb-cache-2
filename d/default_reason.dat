40|$|Abstract—This paper {{addresses}} deafness – {{a problem}} that appears when MAC protocols are designed using directional antennas. Briefly, deafness is caused when a transmitter fails to communicate to its intended receiver, because the receiver is beamformed towards a direction away from the transmitter. Existing CSMA/CA protocols rely {{on the assumption that}} congestion is the predominant cause of communication failure, and adopt backoff schemes to handle congestion. While this may be appropriate for omnidirectional antennas, for directional antennas, both deafness and congestion can be the reason for communication failures. An appropriate directional MAC protocol needs to classify the actual cause of failure, and react accordingly. This paper quantifies the impact of deafness on directional medium access control, and proposes a tone-based mechanism as one way of addressing deafness. The tone-based mechanism, ToneDMAC, assumes congestion as the <b>default</b> <b>reason</b> for communication failures, and applies a corrective measure whenever the cause is deafness. Simulation results indicate that ToneDMAC can alleviate deafness, and perform better than existing directional MAC protocols. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three essays on the estimation of the risk parameter LGD. The first essay (Hartmann-Wendels, Miller, and Töws, 2014, Loss given default for leasing: Parametric and nonparametric estimations) fills a gap in LGD related literature by focusing on elementary differences of the examined estimation approaches. We find that finite mixture models are quite capable of reproducing the unusual shape of the LGD distribution. However, out-of-sample the estimation error increases significantly. Model trees produce robust in-sample and out-of-sample estimations. Furthermore, {{we find that the}} improvement of advanced models increases with an increasing dataset. The second essay (Töws, 2014, The impact of debtor recovery on loss given default) addresses the economic consideration of the workout process of defaulted contracts. Dependent on the lessor’s workout strategy, defaulted contracts may develop in two distinct ways. Either the <b>default</b> <b>reason</b> can be dissolved and the debtor recovers or the contract must be written off. The study indicates the benefits of establishing the lessor’s expertise in assessing a defaulted contract’s continuation worthiness. If successfully implemented, the resulting workout process should produce lower LGDs than before and thereby strengthen the lenders competitiveness. The third essay (Miller and Töws, 2015, Loss given default-adjusted workout processes for leases) contributes to the LGD estimation literature considering unique features of leasing contracts. We economically account for leasing peculiarities and develop a particularly suited approach to estimate the leasing contracts’ LGD. We separate the LGD into its cash flows of the workout process of defaulted leasing contracts. We find that the estimated values of the parts of the LGD are sturdy indicators for the success of the workout process. Thus, the lessor can benefit from the consideration of both these forecasts for his actions concerning the workout process...|$|E

When you determine that a property is distressed, you must act promptly and in a responsible manner to protect both your interests and ours. This quick reference outlines the activities you must perform when you become aware of a distressed property. Please ensure that your foreclosure and bankruptcy representatives and other staff who work with distressed properties have a copy of this quick reference and that they refer to it for all Freddie Mac mortgages. Refer to Sections 67. 27, 67. 28, and Chapter 68 of the Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide (Guide) for additional information on distressed properties. If you have any questions about managing distressed properties, please contact (800) FREDDIE. What Is a Distressed Property? A distressed property is real property that has sustained significant physical deterioration or whose value has been significantly affected by physical deterioration. A property may also become distressed due to abandonment or a natural or man-made disaster. A distressed property is one that: Requires substantial repairs, or Has been condemned by a local authority, or Poses a risk of property ownership to us Examples of distressed properties include, {{but are not limited to}} properties that have been: Damaged from natural or man-made disasters Abandoned and are deteriorating due to vacancy, waste and/or lack of utilities Affected by environmental hazards such as oil or chemical spills, toxic waste or other poisons Reporting a Distressed Property to Us Report all mortgages on distressed properties that are 30 or more days delinquent to us via Electronic Default Reporting (EDR) within the first three business days of the month following the month in which you identified the problem. Use <b>default</b> <b>reason</b> code 011 (property problem) and the appropriate occupancy code. Refer to the EDR Quick Reference Guide for additional information. If the property has a risk of ownership, you must report the mortgage to us, even if it is not delinquent. To do this, submit the following documentation to us within three business days of identifying the risk...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} a recent suggestion that moral particularists can extend their view to countenance <b>default</b> <b>reasons</b> (at a first stab, {{reasons that are}} pro tanto unless undermined) by relying on certain background expectations of normality. I first argue that normality must be understood non-extensionally. Thus if <b>default</b> <b>reasons</b> rest on normality claims, those claims won’t bestow upon <b>default</b> <b>reasons</b> any definite degree of extensional generality. Their generality depends rather on the contingent distributional aspects of the world, which no theory of reasons should purport to settle. Appeals to <b>default</b> <b>reasons</b> cannot therefore uniquely support particularism. But this argument also implies that if moral generalism entailed that moral reasons by necessity have invariant valence (in the natural extensional sense), {{it would be a}} non-starter. Since generalism is not a nonstarter, my argument forces us to rethink the parameters of the generalism-particularism debate. Here I propose to clarify the debate by focusing on its modal rather than extensional aspects. In closing, I outline the sort of generalism that I think is motivated by my discussion, and then articulate some worries this view raises about the theoretical usefulness of the label ‘default reason’...|$|R

The initial story concept was kept deliberately simple, but its complexity increased during the writing process. During his work, Hayashi was given guidelines by Square Enix about the characters and story: for instance, Asano wanted the heroes and villains to be equally compelling, along with raising the game's targeted age group. Something that Hayashi needed to remember during the writing process was the need to limit the length of dialogue segments. While visual novels had a high leeway for dialogue quantity, Asano would make requests such as a sentence being within a 22-character limit, and to not overrun into multiple dialogue boxes.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} develops, justifies, {{and examines}} the jurisprudential {{implications of a}} non-monotonic theory of common law legal reasoning. Legal rules seem to have exceptions but identifying all of them is difficult. This hinders attempts to formalize legal rules using classical logics. Non-monotonic logics allow defeasible inference, permitting rules that hold generally but can be defeated {{in the presence of}} exceptions. This ameliorates the problem of characterizing all exceptions to a rule, because exceptions can be added piecemeal while the rule remains. The first portion of the dissertation rebuts a prominent criticism leveled at a large class of theories of legal reasoning that includes my theory. The charge is that no coherent theory can recognize both (i) the difference between distinguishing and overruling, and (ii) the constraint of precedent. The critics argue that (ii) is more important than (i) and that (ii) can only be explained by monotonic legal rules. Drawing on cognitive psychology as well as legal theory, I show that coherent theories, such as my own, can accommodate both (i) and (ii). The second chapter provides motivation for understanding precedential constraint in terms of non-monotonic default rules and introduces my positive theory, which elaborates on John Horty's work in treating legal rules as prioritized <b>defaults</b> involving <b>reasons.</b> I motivate and implement a relaxation of Horty's restrictions on the form of rules to allow a more fine-grained characterization of precedent. Finally, I explore the relationship between these relaxations and the concept of precedent. The final section explains how my theory fits into the traditional jurisprudential ecosystem. I demonstrate that, contrary to assertions in the legal theory literature, this non-monotonic approach is entirely compatible with positivism's commitment to extracting rules from authoritative legal sources, namely court opinions. I also suggest how it might be attractive to law and economics theorists, pragmatists, and followers of Dworkin...|$|R

40|$|A healthy {{banking system}} is a {{fundamental}} condition for financial stability. When assessing the riskiness of the banking system, analysts often restrict their focus to large banks. This may create a distorted picture in countries like Germany with fragmented banking systems. In Germany, savings banks and cooperative banks taken together are important players in the market. However, {{little is known about}} their <b>default</b> risk. The <b>reason</b> is that these banks usually resolve financial distress within their own organisations, which means defaults are not observable from the outside. In this paper we use a new dataset which contains information about financial distress and financial strength of all German savings banks and cooperative banks. The data have been gathered by the Deutsche Bundesbank for microprudential supervision and have never before been exploited for macroprudential purposes. We use the data to identify the main risk drivers. To this end we estimate a default prediction model (hazard model). A second goal of the paper is to analyse the impact of macroeconomic information for forecasting banks' defaults. Recent findings for the USA have cast some doubt on the usefulness of macroeconomic information for banks' risk assessment.

The target of this study is to model and simulate the microorthogonal cutting process in the presence of dead metal cap in order to investigate the effects of this phenomenon on the micromachining process outputs (cutting force, thrust force and chip thickness) and stress distribution, equivalent plastic strain and temperature inside the workpiece shear zones. For this purpose, the finite element method with explicit dynamic solution and adiabatic heating effect along with arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian approach is used.

Micro-orthogonal cutting experiments are carried out on tubular AISI 1045 workpieces for validating and interpreting simulated results. The error between predicted and experimental data is calculated, and it is shown that simulation performances can be improved by considering the dead metal cap into the process model.

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} {{hierarchical}} Marshall-Olkin model of countrywide systemic risk. At the lower level, we model the systemic {{risk of a}} crisis within the banking system (that we call “within ” systemic risk) and at the higher level we model {{the probability of a}} joint default of the banking system and the public sector (that we call “between ” systemic risk). As for the within systemic risk, we propose a technique, that we call Cuadras-Augé filter, to extract the probability intensity of a systemic event. We apply the model to Europe and we find that, during the financial crisis, the within systemic component of the default risk in the banking sector has significantly increased in all countries, with the exception of Germany and the Netherlands. As for the between systemic risk, we find that Italy, Germany and Ireland share the same correlation between the time to default of the financial and public sectors (around 70 %).
