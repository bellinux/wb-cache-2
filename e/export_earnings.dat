We perform an evidence-based {{assessment of the}} most relevant economic, social, and environmental implications of the "soybeanization" of Argentinian agriculture. Our diagnostic relies {{on a combination of}} published sources and a unique data set drawn from a field survey carried out in 2011 in two provinces of the Argentinian Pampas. This data set allows us to evaluate with a reliable empirical base the socio-economic impacts of GM soybean cultivation. Our analysis suggests a conflict between the success of the "soybeanization" of Argentinian agriculture measured in terms of production and profit records, and the social, economic, and environmental sustainability of this new model of production. On the one hand, GM soybean technological package adoption has increased farm productivity, and reduced the costs per unit produced, resulting in a dramatic increase in profits. On the other hand, the specialization of Argentinian agriculture on soybean cultivation has increased the dependence of public finances on the foreign exchange revenue generated by <b>exports</b> <b>earnings.</b> We also find a mixed empirical picture of changing land distribution patterns and labor displacement resulting from GM soybean expansion. Finally, we find that the environmental implications of agricultural biotechnology appear alarming and the long-term sustainability of GM crops highly questionable.

40|$|A {{symposium}} {{paper on}} the importance of agriculture to the then Rhodesia's <b>exports</b> <b>earnings.</b> Paper presented on Day 2 of Symposium on: Current Economic Problems: Export Development. The Rhodesian economy has many different characteristics. In some sectors we can find a degree of development and sophistication that ranks with the most developed regions of the world; in others our economy has all the manifestations of underdevelopment. The one overriding characteristic that possibly warrants the classification of our economy as underdeveloped, is the large part that agriculture continues to play in the economic life of Rhodesia. Not only is agriculture the predominant activity of our African population, but it also plays a very important part in the more commercially orientated sectors of the economy. As a primary industry which contributes 17 per cent to the gross Domestic Product, agriculture occupies a position of importance to the economy that is not now found in South Africa or in other more developed regions. A poor agricultural season has the capacity in Rhodesia to retard severely the growth rate of the economy. The industry’s demands for goods and services, as well as its role as a source of raw materials and food, form the basis of much of Rhodesian commercial and industrial activity. Agriculture’s role as an exporter further emphasises its importance to the Rhodesian economy, but unfortunately under present circumstances we can only deal with this aspect of the industry in the most general terms...|$|R

That is, challenges and opportunities that emerges when a country clears the table of the most distortive polices and institutions that mediates its exchanges with the rest of world. And what are those issues? Export diversification, the country's regions access to trade, completion of the “multidimensional ” trade strategy and transport costs. Whereas {{there is no doubt that}} Chile has made progress in diversifying its exports away from copper, concentration is still high even when compared to other resource intensive countries.
