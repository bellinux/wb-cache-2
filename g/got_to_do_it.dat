500|$|Throughout the crisis, Kerr did {{not tell}} Whitlam of his {{increasing}} concerns, nor did he suggest that he might dismiss Whitlam. He believed nothing he said would influence Whitlam, and feared that, if Whitlam perceived him as a possible opponent, the Prime Minister would procure his dismissal from the Queen. Accordingly, though Kerr dealt with Whitlam in an affable manner, he did not confide his thinking to the Prime Minister. Labor Senator Tony Mulvihill later related that [...] "Whitlam {{would come back to}} each caucus meeting and say, 'I saw His Excellency... No worry. He's <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> his way.'... at no time did he hint that the Governor-General was frowning." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite being a {{critical}} and commercial failure, Tank Girl {{is often said}} to have a cult following. Petty's version of Tank Girl remains a popular character at cosplay events. The music video for Avril Lavigne's 2013 song [...] "Rock n Roll" [...] was heavily influenced by Tank Girl. During her interview included on the Blu-ray release of the film in 2013, Petty was asked why she thinks the film still resonates with fans, and replied: [...] "There's no formula as to why Tank Girl was so fabulous and why people love it so much... It was unique, it was new, it was fresh, it was way ahead of its time, and I'm happy that I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> and that I'll always have her." [...] Luke Buckmaster from the BBC included the film in his 2015 list of the [...] "ten weirdest superhero films", asserting that: [...] "at its best, director Rachel Talalay captures an ostentatious steampunk vibe that proves weirdly addictive." ...|$|E
500|$|Expecting {{to show a}} new {{and more}} mature side visually, TLC were in Los Angeles {{discussing}} about the project when a Matthew Rolston-directed music video for Salt-N-Pepa came on. [...] "We were looking at it and said, 'Whoever did this video has to do the 'Creep' video. We {{fell in love with the}} way it was shot," [...] Thomas said. Often times, she remembered the video that they were seeing was [...] "Whatta Man", however, during their interview with MTV in 1995, the show cited [...] "None of Your Business", a video which was also done by Rolston and had more visual similarities to the final [...] "Creep" [...] video. Lopes also recalled the moment: [...] "We were very, very adamant about redoing the 'Creep' video because we were coming back out [...] And we were like, 'Look at that video Salt-N-Pepa got. Man, we're going to kick nobody's butts putting these videos out. [...] is budi, [...] is whack, we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> over.'" [...] Their management team then suggested going back to the editing room to find better shots and have the video redone, but group declined and said: [...] "There is no better shot." [...] Initially, TLC reached out to Rolston and set up the third version's shooting in LA.|$|E

2500|$|Lower Than Atlantis was {{produced}} by Dan Lancaster, {{over the course of}} [...] "seven or eight months". The band brought Lancaster in because of his pop credentials, his heavy rock background and the ability to merge the two. After every recording session the group had a demo where they would re-record each instrument part-by-part. Lancaster would constantly attempt to get the best take every time, according to Duce: [...] "He'd be like: 'That was shit. You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> again.' There's no bullshit." [...] Previously the band would worry if they made a mistake as it would costs a lot to hire the studio and personnel, however, since the band had their own studio they took it at a leisurely pace. Three drum tracks were recorded at the band's studio, before the band relocated to Peter Miles' studio in Devon where they recorded the remaining drum tracks.|$|E

I was the only one at the time that could drive. I used to have to drive the bloody van and get them up at quarter to nine every morning; which was, believe me, early for us then. I said to them, [...] "This is how we have <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> because this is how Jethro Tull did it." [...] They had a schedule and they knew that they were going to work from this time till that time. I tried that with our band and we got into doing it. It worked.

2500|$|Several {{commentators}} {{complained that}} because Pietersen changed {{from being a}} right-handed to a left-handed batsman as the bowler approached his delivery stride, he was gaining an unfair advantage. Gideon Haigh said that [...] "A bowler must advise a batsman when he's changing direction, why should the batsmen not; given that where the bowler's aiming {{will depend on the}} placement of the off stump". Ian Healy seconded this by saying [...] "It just should be outlawed straightaway. If you want to hit {{to one side of the}} field, you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in a cross fashion, and not swap the way you're facing or your grip. Otherwise you are going to start to allow the bowlers to go round the wicket, over the wicket, and keep swapping during their run-ups." [...] Former fast-bowler Michael Holding argued [...] "if the batsman can change from being right-handed to left-handed, there shouldn't be a problem with a bowler changing from being right-handed to left-handed, either, without having to tell the umpire, nor should he have to tell the umpire if he is going over or round the wicket." ...|$|E

Speaking with Idolator's Mike Wass, Minogue stated [...] "I always thought I would do a Christmas album, {{it was just a}} case of when... I mentioned it to a couple of people on my team and they were saying, 'What {{do you want to do}} for the rest of the year? What do you want to do next?' I said, 'I'm thinking about a Christmas album, actually.' Some of that stems from last Christmas." [...] Minogue said that she had Christmas in Los Angeles, California in 2014, and her friend suggest recording a Christmas album; [...] "They just assumed I had done one, and when I said I hadn't done an entire album they just started, 'You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> It would be amazing. We just want to see your little outfits.'" [...] Kylie Christmas was recorded at Angel Studios and Sarm Music Village, and features a mix of both classical Christmas songs and new original material.
