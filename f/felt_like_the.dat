5|$|Arthur and {{his mother}} Atlanna are flying over the Bermuda Triangle. As they get closer, Atlanna's {{necklace}} begins to glow and a surge of light and energy erupts from the ocean, causing cyclones which bring their plane down. Atlanna is kidnapped by a siren, but not before giving Arthur her necklace and calling him Orin. Ten years later, Arthur is charged for releasing dolphins from a marine park. His father bails him out of trouble, but gives him a stern lecture on responsibility. Later, Arthur tells his friend Eva that he <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> dolphins were calling to him. While he's working, he is approached by a lighthouse keeper who identifies himself as McCaffery. The Coast Guard picks up an unidentified man floating in the Bermuda Triangle and pleading to warn Orin. Lt. Torres is sent to investigate the area. Arthur is also at the Triangle, and his necklace triggers another surge of light, which causes Torres to crash her jet. Brigman transports the John Doe to another facility, and persuades Torres to join his team. Brigman {{is looking for a}} connection between the disappearances of thousands of individuals, and their reappearance years later without ever aging a day.|$|E
25|$|Although Ma Chao {{historically}} died in 222, in the novel, he {{is mentioned}} {{to be still}} alive during Zhuge Liang's southern campaign against the Nanman and {{is in charge of}} guarding Hanzhong from possible attacks by the state of Cao Wei. He died of illness after Zhuge Liang returned from the campaign. Zhuge Liang tells Zhao Yun that Ma Chao's death <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> loss of an arm to him.|$|E
25|$|The three {{episodes of}} the {{crossover}} all received positive reviews, with critics praising {{the interactions between}} all of the various actors from each series, {{and the fact that}} each episode was also able to progress season storylines while still being part of the crossover. Conversely, the Dominators storyline <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> weakest part of the crossover, with reviewers feeling the alien race had unclear motivations throughout. Ratings for the episodes were exceptional, with each breaking records in viewership and the 18-49 rating, contributing to the most-watched week on The CW in six years.|$|E

60|$|Tom's {{hands were}} on his gun, and for <b>the</b> moment he <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> {{pointing}} <b>the</b> weapon at the man. But then {{he concluded that}} this would do small good, and the weapon remained where it was.|$|R
500|$|Of the ending, Futterman {{noted that}} [...] "the final scenes {{actually}} wound up truthful to these characters", and Kevin Sullivan of MTV wrote that [...] "when the two separate moments finally did {{arrive at the}} end of the episode, it <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> natural end and was quite touching".|$|E
500|$|When they {{informed}} {{them of the}} title, their record label's American office e-mailed them about there being a [...] "Coexist" [...] bumper sticker. Croft said that [...] "I know it has that connection, but it <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> right word. It's cool, I guess? It's a nice message? Everybody getting along?" ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after taking}} the oath of office, Truman spoke to reporters: [...] "Boys, if you ever pray, pray for me now. I don't know if you fellas ever had a load of hay fall on you, but {{when they told me}} what {{happened}} yesterday, I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> moon, the stars, and all the planets had fallen on me." ...|$|E
5000|$|Toulouse-Lautrec {{was in fact}} an {{influence}} on Guinan; {{as a young man}} he saw the film [...] "Moulin Rouge" [...] and <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> Toulouse-Lautrec, <b>the</b> 19th-century French painter known for his portraits of night life in Paris.|$|R

500|$|... "Marilyn Monroe" [...] was {{generally}} well received by music critics, with some noting its crossover potential, while others <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> song was too {{similar to other}} artists. The song has received comparisons to the 2011 singles [...] "Disaster" [...] by JoJo and [...] "Stuttering" [...] by Fefe Dobson, as well as Minaj's own 2010 single [...] "Your Love" [...] from her debut album Pink Friday. The album's high digital sales led [...] "Marilyn Monroe" [...] to chart on the UK Singles Chart and US Billboard charts.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Television {{columnist}} Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{said that}} past 30 Rock episodes took [...] "old sitcom cliches" [...] {{and were able}} to find a [...] "demented" [...] new take on them. In his review, Sepinwall wrote that [...] "Generalissimo" [...] <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> staff [...] "came up with the cliches they wanted to mock – goofy/evil twins, a character spinning a ridiculous web of lies to land a new crush – and never moved to the next step." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{agreed that}} the scenes with the Dothraki were strong, with the storyline having {{improved}} significantly since the first episodes. Poniewozik stated that [...] "this was the first week for me that the Dothraki scenes were not just absorbing but <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> characters were as well-imagined as those in Westeros," [...] and McNutt felt the episode [...] "finally allows Khal Drogo to become an actual character." [...] Drogo's rant vowing to give his unborn son the Iron Throne led to compliments about Jason Momoa's intensity and Emilia Clarke's calm and loving facial expressions.|$|E
5000|$|The unusual beat {{was created}} by Swizz Beatz while having fun and felt to make a song. The warping effect was from Crazy Town's Hollywood Babylon. He recalled: [...] "I did the beat because I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> making <b>the</b> beat." ...|$|R

500|$|Reviewers {{compared}} Monaco {{to other}} games and films. The most common comparison {{was to the}} 1960 heist film Oceans 11. Scott Nichols compared it to Oceans 11 because [...] "with its ensemble cast, daring break-ins and carefully laid plans, {{it has all the}} makings of an interactive heist flick". Anton Bjurvald (Eurogamer) also compared the game to Oceans 11. Roger Hargreaves mentioned that he <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> game was [...] "Ocean’s Eleven meets Pac-Man and Metal Gear Solid". He compared it to Pac-Man because of the maze-like levels.|$|E
500|$|The A.V. Club writer John Teti {{gave the}} episode a mixed review calling it [...] "fine". Teti {{wrote that he}} <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> {{producers}} [...] "was doing Valentine’s Day [...] out of obligation" [...] and that the writers {{did not have a}} [...] "great idea" [...] for this episode like [...] "My Funky Valentine". He ultimately gave the episode a B-. Entertainment Weekly writer Lesley Savage gave the episode a more positive review saying the cast [...] "proved why they truly deserved the award in tonight's Valentine's Day themed episode." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} interview, {{when asked whether}} the series had finished, both co-creators {{answered}} with a simultaneous [...] "Yes!". Morris expressed that [...] "I think the time is right. After the first film, I wanted to hear more from Jay, Will, Neil and Simon. But this time I feel there is enough. There {{is more than enough}} Jay in this world", and Beesley added [...] "The end of the story has always <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> time where they go off and start living their adult life. And I think this film takes us up to that point".|$|E
5000|$|I {{wanted this}} song to feel <b>like</b> love in <b>the</b> springtime. That's what <b>the</b> music <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> to me <b>the</b> first time I heard it. [...] - Sy Smith, Soultracks ...|$|R
5000|$|Although no fan of Carey's run on {{the main}} title, Stephen Holland thought that [...] "Carey is on the toppest form I've known of him" [...] and that the style evoked earlier periods as <b>the</b> [...] "script <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> Ennis, <b>the</b> art <b>like</b> a moodier, more solid John Ridgway." ...|$|R
60|$|Once in <b>the</b> dressing-room, Honora <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> locking <b>the</b> {{doors and}} {{jumping out of}} the window. She gave her coat to the maid, rearranged her hair without any {{apparent}} reason, and was leisurely putting on her hat again, and wondering {{what she would do}} next, when Mrs. Kame appeared.|$|R
500|$|... "Cold Comfort" [...] stars Pemberton as Andy, a new volunteer, and Shearsmith as George, Andy's supervisor. According to Shearsmith, he and Pemberton do not {{typically}} write Inside No. 9 scripts with particular actors {{in mind for}} roles, and nor do they typically write roles specifically for themselves. They were unsure, for a long time, on which characters they should take, initially considering having Shearsmith play Andy and Pemberton play George. Shearsmith said that this <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> more [...] "obvious" [...] option, but the characters were switched as they [...] "thought it would be slightly more unusual" [...] to have it that way around.|$|E
500|$|Carabott {{also had}} his own {{feelings}} about the first official [...] "Justice League" [...] appearance in season six's [...] "Justice". The writer suggested that the first live-action appearance of the League since the failed pilot back in the 1990s deserved {{more than just a}} single episode. Carabott stated that {{at least two or three}} episodes would have been needed to properly tell the narrative of their introduction. Instead, he <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> character introductions were rushed, even though they had all appeared on the series prior to season six. [...] "Justice" [...] would go on to earn the highest ratings of any episode in season six, with 5.26 million viewers.|$|E
500|$|Flood {{immediately}} {{pushed the}} band {{to change its}} recording practices. Corgan later said, [...] "Flood <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> band he would see live wasn't really captured on record". In April 1995, the band began recording in a rehearsal space, instead of entering the studio straight away. At these sessions, the band recorded rough rhythm tracks with Flood. Originally designed to create a rough draft for the record, the rehearsal space sessions ended up yielding {{much of the new}} album's rhythm section parts. Flood also insisted the band set aside time each day devoted to jamming or songwriting, practices the band had never engaged in before during recording sessions. Corgan said, [...] "Working like that kept the whole process very interesting—kept it from becoming a grind." ...|$|E

5000|$|Elemeno P is the self-titled third studio {{album of}} New Zealand rock band Elemeno P. It was {{released}} on May 26, 2008. The band say that they [...] "decided to make this record self titled as it really <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it's <b>the</b> most honest and elemeno p-ish record to date." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{dinner was}} {{unexpectedly}} merry. Every one <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> celebrating <b>the</b> army, and Maynard, as {{the representative of}} the cavalry arm, came near blushing at the praise which floated his way on toasts which were drunk from a bottle of sherry, a liquor Jennie had smuggled in for cooking purposes.|$|R
500|$|The visual {{style of}} VVVVVV is heavily {{inspired}} by games released for the Commodore 64 8-bit computer from the 1980s, especially Jet Set Willy which is referenced by {{the element of}} collecting difficult-to-reach shiny objects and most notably the naming of each room; Cavanagh aimed to create a game [...] "that looked and <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> C64 games I grew up with." [...] He eventually entrusted naming the rooms to QWOP developer Bennett Foddy, who created every room name in the final version. The graphical style of VVVVVV is heavily influenced by the Commodore 64; similarly, the game's music is heavily dependent on chiptune elements. Swedish composer Magnus Pålsson scored the game, and released the original soundtrack in 2010, titled PPPPPP.|$|E
500|$|Michael Caine as John Cutter, {{the stage}} {{engineer}} (ingenieur) {{who works with}} Angier and Borden. Caine had previously collaborated with Nolan and Bale in Batman Begins. Nolan said that even though it <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> character of Cutter was written for Caine, it was not. Nolan noted that the character was written [...] "before I'd ever met" [...] Caine. Caine describes Cutter as [...] "a teacher, {{a father and a}} guide to Angier". Caine, in trying to create Cutter's nuanced portrait, altered his voice and posture. Nolan later said that [...] "Michael Caine’s character really becomes something of the heart of the film. He has a wonderful warmth and emotion to him that draws you into the story and allows you to have a point of view on these characters without judging them too harshly." ...|$|E
500|$|Commenting on the {{controversy}} the book generated, Steiner admitted to literary journalist and critic Ron Rosenbaum (author of Explaining Hitler) {{that he too}} was disturbed by it, adding that his fictional Hitler had gotten the better of him, [...] "golem- or Frankenstein-like". He said that it <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> book [...] "wrote me". Steiner {{also pointed out that}} the novella is not only about his thoughts on the Holocaust, but also about the horrific events that took place in countries like Cambodia, Vietnam, El Salvador and Burundi: [...] "My feeling is that one has to grapple with the abyss if one can." [...] In his 1997 memoir, Errata: An Examined Life, Steiner remarked that had he known what the response to The Portage and its stage interpretation would be, he would have made the novella [...] "my foremost business".|$|E
5000|$|... "While {{working on}} The Last of Us, I had this secret agenda: ... I {{wanted to create}} one of the coolest, non-sexualized female protagonists, and I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> with <b>The</b> Last of Us there was an {{opportunity}} here to change the industry."

5000|$|The {{first four}} {{finishers}} had all {{run in the}} Derby, then skipped the Preakness. [...] "We <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> with <b>the</b> five weeks in between, and with the way this horse had trained, {{that he had a}} legitimate chance," [...] said Pletcher, who is based at Belmont Park. [...] "I think that's always an advantage." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ron Perlman {{was offered}} two {{different}} {{roles in the}} film, but accepted {{the role of a}} transsexual character. He is quoted as saying [...] "They offered me two different roles and I went for the transsexual because I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> when <b>the</b> door opens and you see that it's me, it should get a 'Yuck!'" ...|$|R
