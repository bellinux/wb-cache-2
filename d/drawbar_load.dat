50|$|This, {{combined}} with {{the age of the}} 'PL' series of passenger cars, caused scrapping to begin in 1978, which lasted until 1988. The cars were removed earlier than many other classes, because with their lighter construction they could only handle a maximum <b>drawbar</b> <b>load</b> of 360 tonnes trailing, against 900 tonnes for the other timber passenger car classes.|$|E
5000|$|With {{distributed}} power, long trains e.g. ore trains on mining lines {{may have}} locomotives {{at each end}} and at intermediate locations in the train to reduce the maximum <b>drawbar</b> <b>load.</b> The locomotives are often radio controlled from the lead locomotive by the Locotrol system. Remote control locomotives e.g. [...] "switchers" [...] in hump yards may be controlled by a stationary operator. These types of remote control systems often use the AAR MU standard which allows any locomotive using the AAR Mu standard to be easily [...] "MU'ed" [...] to a control receiver and thus capable of becoming remote-controlled.|$|E
40|$|A John Deere 8530 IVT tractor (Waterloo, Iowa) with a {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) that could be operated in automatic (CVT) or manual (fixed gear ratio) mode was tested for fuel consumption at a setpoint travel speed of 9 km·h‐ 1 with 17 different <b>drawbar</b> <b>loads.</b> Linear regression analysis results showed that with the throttle set to maximum in both transmission modes, operating the tractor with the transmission in the automatic mode was more fuel efficient than operating with the transmission in the manual mode when the drawbar power was approximately 78 %, or less, of maximum power. When load transition portions of the data were filtered out, {{there was no significant}} effect of load sequencing in the remaining data. On the other hand, there was a noticeable effect of travel direction which could occur due to a minor slope of the test track in the direction of travel. Testing of more tractor models from different manufacturers and at different travel speeds is needed to determine if these results can be applied to different tractor models produced by the same and/or other manufacturers...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanics}} of a tractor-trailer system {{moving up and}} down sloping ground under different operating conditions was theoretically simulated. A computer program was developed to analyze the system to predict the effect of both the trailer loading weight and the slope angle on the tractor stability, traction ability, and <b>drawbar</b> <b>loading.</b> The program was used to analyze a tractor-trailer system moving at uniform motion up and downhill. The results of this analysis showed that the tractor becomes unstable when towing a 3750 kg trailer uphill at 28 ° slope angle. Insufficient traction occurred at slope angles ranging from 15 ° to 18 ° corresponding to trailer weight of 3750 to 750 kg. The parallel component of drawbar pull reached a maximum value of 17318 N when the trailer was pushing the tractor downhill at 30 ° slope angle. The normal component (normal to the tractive surface) showed similar maximum values for both uphill and downhill motions of the system. The use of computer analysis in this study provided a significant improvement in predicting the effect of different parameters on stability and control of tractor-trailer combination on sloping ground...|$|R
40|$|In {{this field}} study, data were {{collected}} to determine power requirements required by a trailing site preparation plow and the magnitudes of dynamic forces experienced by a plow during normal operation and during impact with stumps or other obstructions. Drawbar pull {{data were collected}} from five different tillage treatments on a recently harvested loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) site in central Ala-bama. The five treatments were: 1) a coulter, ripping shank, and four bedding disks; 2) a coulter, ripping shank, and two bedding disks; 3) a coulter and ripping shank; 4) a coulter alone; and 5) a ripping shank alone. A 330 kN [75 000 lb] capacity tension load cell was used to measure the <b>drawbar</b> <b>load,</b> a GPS receiver recorded tractor speed, four direct current displacement transducers (DCDT’s) moni-tored the depth of the disks, and two optical tachometers measured the speed of the tractor’s front and rear drive shafts. Each treatment produced significantly different drawbar loads (to alpha levels less than 0. 001). The re-sulting mean loads were 46. 0 kN [10 300 lb], 33. 5 kN [7530 lb], 31. 5 kN [7080 lb], 15. 8 kN [3560 lb], and 43. 4 kN [9760 lb] for treatments one through five, respectively. Maxi-mum recorded <b>drawbar</b> <b>load</b> during a collision with a stump was 338. 9 kN [76 188 lb]...|$|E
40|$|Two Canadian federal {{government}} departments, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) and Environment Canada, are collaborating {{in a pilot}} project aimed at obtaining agricultural tractor exhaust gas emissions data under actual field conditions. AAFC’s unique instrumented research tractor will provide the platform for collecting these data. This tractor was developed as a general purpose research tool, and was fitted {{with a series of}} sensors and an on-board data logger for measuring and recording tractor operational parameters such as engine speed, <b>drawbar</b> <b>load,</b> and fuel consumption as the tractor is doing normal field work. An instrumented exhaust pipe is being developed to measure exhaust gas temperature, flow, and NOx concentration with provision for future sensors for CO, CO and VOC. Signals from the exhaust pipe instrumentation will be logged on the tractor data logger along with the other tractor operational parameters. Field data can be used directly, or to program a laboratory dynamometer to reproduce the same engine load cycles for comparative emissions measurements on other tractor makes and models. The research will form a basis for development of emissions factors for agricultural field operations. ...|$|E
40|$|Numerous advancements in {{machinery}} {{performance of}} agricultural tractors {{have been made}} in recent years. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) tests predetermined points (e. g., maximum power and torque) for drawbar, Power Take-Off (PTO), and hydraulic power as separate tests for tractor performance. Testing methods with the tractor operating at a steady state have been done for years, which were uncharacteristic of agricultural tractor operations in field conditions. As part of this thesis work, field usable data acquisition systems (DAQs) were developed to record implement energy consumption (e. g., <b>drawbar</b> <b>loading,</b> PTO torque, and hydraulic power). The system used LabVIEW software and National Instrument’s compact data acquisition systems (cDAQs) to record data from instrumentation measuring drawbar, PTO, and hydraulic loads. Data were collected and verified in accordance with OECD standards at the Nebraska Tractor Test Lab (NTTL), an official OECD testing facility. Requirements of the systems were: implementation of each system on multiple machines with minor alterations, minimal changes to the tractor, and equivalent data compared to that recorded by the NTTL testing devices and procedures. Manufacturer’s calibration information along with standardized testing equipment used to tune NTTL testing devices were used to verify that the system would provide data in conformance with OECD testing procedures. The hydraulic system was verified with varying hydraulic line curvatures near the sensors that provided data within a 1 percent difference of the actual hydraulic power. Drawbar tests included calibration of a strain gage instrumented <b>drawbar</b> which recorded <b>loads</b> within 0. 67 kN of the calibration fixture. Track testing of the drawbar resulted in measured differences of less than 1 kN with the NTTL load car. For PTO measurements, a power take-off calibration was conducted using a commercially available torque transducer. No statistically {{significant differences were found between}} the torque values of the PTO transducer and the dynamometer. The differences in torque values ranged from 3 N∙m to 23 N∙m.

40|$|Numerous advancements in {{machinery}} {{performance on}} row-crop agricultural tractors {{have been made}} in recent years. Currently, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) only tests predetermined points (E. g., max. power, max. torque) for drawbar and hydraulic power. This method of testing has been used for many years with the tractor at a steady state which is usually not typical of row-crop operations. A data acquisition system (DAQ) was designed that records implement energy consumption (E. g., <b>drawbar</b> <b>loading,</b> PTO power, and hydraulic power). The system used a LabVIEW program and a compact data acquisition system (cDAQ) to record data from instrumentation outputting drawbar, PTO, and hydraulic loads. Data were then collected and verified in accordance with OECD standards at the Nebraska Tractor Test Lab (NTTL), an official OECD testing facility. Requirements of the system were: implementation of the system on multiple machines with minor alterations, minimally invasive to the factory design of the tractor, and equivalent data compared to those recorded by the NTTL testing devices and procedures. Manufacturers’ calibration information along with standardized testing equipment used to tune NTTL testing devices were used to verify that the system would perform according to OECD guidelines. The collection methodology included hydraulic testing at steady state in accordance to OECD Code 2. The hydraulic system was verified with varying curvatures near the sensors that provided data within a 1 percent error of the actual hydraulic power. Another test included calibration of a strain instrumented drawbar within 100 lbf of a dynamic load...|$|R
40|$|Three {{models for}} {{predicting}} fuel consumption for agricultural tractors with partial <b>drawbar</b> <b>loads</b> were compared. Data {{were collected from}} eight John Deere tractors, JD 7230 R (e 23), 7250 R (e 23), 7270 R (e 23), 7290 R (e 23), 7290 R (IVT), 8320 R (16 speed), 8345 RT (IVT), 8370 R (IVT). The tractors were tested with 7 load levels per speed at four different travel speeds {{as close as possible}} to 4, 7. 5, 10, and 13 km·h- 1. The IVT tractors were operated in Auto mode and the geared tractors were shifted up three gears and throttled back to the same travel speeds as the IVT tractors. The 7 loads were selected at 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 75, and 80 % of drawbar pull at maximum power at the selected speed. Model 1 (fuel consumption as a liner function of drawbar power), currently used in OECD Code 2, Section 4. 4. 8 (OECD, 2014), resulted in a unique equation for each speed. When the slopes for each tractor were compared, 79 % of the comparisons were not significantly different. For 80 % of the tractors, the second variable in Models 2 and 3 were determined to be significant. For 80 % of the tractors, Model 2 was determined to be more accurate than Model 3.. While Model 1 was found to be more accurate than Model 2, the requirement of having a separate equation for each speed limits the practical application of Model 1. Model 2 had only slightly larger error than Model 1, but has the additional flexibility of being applicable over a range of speeds. Advisor: Michael Koche...|$|R

50|$|In {{particular}} {{reference to}} steam engines, the carrying wheels {{have a very}} important purpose of allowing the engine's weight distribution to be altered. For example {{in the use of}} leading wheels it would allow the boiler to be located further forward of the driving wheels, the weight of which counters the leverage imposed by the <b>drawbar</b> and the <b>load</b> of the pulled wagons/cars about the fulcrum of the rearmost driving wheel. Similarly the trailing wheels can move the fulcrum to the rearmost trailing wheel. Such change can dramatically improve the operating speeds of engines and their tractive effort.|$|R
40|$|Five {{models for}} {{estimating}} fuel consumption for agricultural tractors with partial <b>drawbar</b> <b>loads</b> were compared. Data {{were collected from}} eight John Deere tractors, JD 7230 R (e 23), 7250 R (e 23), 7270 R (e 23), 7290 R (e 23), 8320 R (16 speed), 7290 R (IVT), 8345 RT (IVT), 8370 R (IVT), on the drawbar test track at the Nebraska Tractor Test Lab. The tractors were tested with seven load levels per speed at three different travel speeds {{as close as possible}} to 7. 5, 10, and 13 km h- 1. The IVT tractors were operated in auto mode, and the geared tractors were shifted up three gears and throttled back to the same travel speeds as obtained with the original gear (before shifting up) at maximum drawbar power. The seven loads were selected at 30 %, 40 %, 50 %, 60 %, 70 %, 75 %, and 80 % of the drawbar pull at maximum power and rated engine speed at the selected travel speed. Model 1 (fuel consumption as a linear function of drawbar power on concrete), currently used in OECD Code 2, Section 4. 4. 8, resulted in a separate equation for each speed tested. When regression mean square errors were used for statistical comparison of the five fuel consumption models, model 5 (fuel consumption as a linear function of drawbar power and travel speed on concrete, and engine speed) was not significantly different from the model currently used in OECD Code 2, Section 4. 4. 8 (model 1, fuel consumption as a linear function of drawbar power on concrete, with separate equations specific to the three speeds tested). The simplest model (model 2), which used a single equation for fuel consumption as a linear function of drawbar power on concrete over the range of speeds tested, had significantly higher regression mean square errors compared to model 1 for half of the eight tractors tested. Model 5 (fuel consumption as a linear function of drawbar power and travel speed on concrete, and engine speed) was determined to be the best of the five models for estimating fuel consumption, with a single equation applicable over the range of speeds tested. Model 3 (fuel consumption as a linear function of drawbar power and travel speed on concrete) provided a statistically equivalent fuel consumption estimate to model 5 without the drawback of requiring an input value for engine speed...|$|R
