40|$|The {{secretion}} of killer toxins by some {{strains of}} yeasts {{is a phenomenon}} of significant industrial importance. The activity of a recently discovered Kluyveromyces lactis <b>killer</b> <b>strain</b> against a sensitive Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain was determined on peptone-yeast extract-nutrient agar plates containing as the carbon source glucose, fructose, galactose, maltose, or glycerol at pH 4. 5 or 6. 5. Enhanced activity (50 to 90 % increase) was found at pH 6. 5, particularly on the plates containing galactose, maltose, or glycerol, although production of the toxin in liquid medium was not significantly different with either glucose or galactose as the carbon source. Results indicated that {{the action of the}} K. lactis toxin was not mediated by catabolite repression in the sensitive strain. Sensitivities of different haploid and polyploid Saccharomyces yeasts to the two different killer yeasts S. cerevisiae (RNA-plasmid-coded toxin) and K. lactis (DNA-plasmid-coded toxin) were tested. Three industrial polyploid yeasts sensitive to the S. cerevisiae killer yeast were resistant to the K. lactis killer yeast.

40|$|Killing {{is perhaps}} the most {{definite}} form of communication possible. Microbes such as yeasts and gutbacteria have been shown to exhibit killer phenotypes. The killer strains are able to kill othermicrobes occupying the same ecological niche, and do so with impunity. It would therefore beexpected that, wherever a killer phenotype has arisen, all members of the population would soon bekillers or dead. Surprisingly, (i) one can find both killer and sensitive strains in coexistence, both inthe wild and in in-vitro experiments, and (ii) the absolute fitness cost of the killer phenotype oftenseems to be very small. We present an explicit model of such coexistence in a fragmented or discreteenvironment. A <b>killer</b> <b>strain</b> may kill all sensitive cells in one patch (one piece of rotting fruit, onecave or one human gut, for example), allowing sensitives to exist only in the absence of killer strainson the same patch. In our model, populations spread easily between patches, but in a stochasticmanner: One can imagine spores borne by the wind over a field of untended apple trees, or entericdisease transmission in a region in which travel is effectively unrestricted. What we show is thatcoexistence is not only possible, but that it is possible even if the absolute fitness advantage of thesensitive strain over the <b>killer</b> <b>strain</b> is arbitrarily small. We do this by performing a specificallytargeted mathematical analysis on our model, rather than via simulations. Our model does not assumelarge population densities, and may thus be useful in the context of understanding the ecology ofextreme environments...|$|E

Although Northern (RNA) blot hybridizations indicated that L-dsRNA from Z. bailii is a LA species, additional peptide maps of the purified 85 -kDa capsid from Z. bailii and the 88 - and 80 -kDa major coat proteins from K 1 and K 28 killer viruses of Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed distinctly different patterns of peptides. Electron microscopy of purified Z. bailii viruses (ZbV) identified icosahedral particles 40 nm in diameter which were undistinguishable from the S. cerevisiae killer viruses. We demonstrated that purified ZbVs are sufficient to confer the Z. bailii killer phenotype on transfected spheroplasts of a S. cerevisiae nonkiller strain and that the resulting transfectants secreted even more killer toxin that the original ZbV donor strain did. Curing experiments with ZbV-transfected S. cerevisiae strains indicated that the M-dsRNA satellite from Z. bailii contains the genetic information for toxin production, whereas expression of toxin immunity might be dependent on Z-dsRNA, which resembles a new dsRNA replicon in yeasts that is not dependent on an LA helper virus to be stably maintained and replicated within the cell...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Saccharomyces cells {{occasionally}} carry cytoplasmic ds-RNA “killer” viruses coding for low-mass proteins, which upon secretion to {{the environment}} can kill related cells that do not carry the viral particles. Such killer viruses are not infectious, and can spread only through cell division and during mating. Three principal classes of Saccharomyces viruses (ScV-M 1, ScV-M 2 and ScV-M 28) belonging to the Totiviridae family have been characterised, each capable of forming a specific anti-competitor toxin and corresponding antidote. Presumably, toxic killing provides competitive benefits to the yeast host. However, the ecological and evolutionary significance of toxin production remains poorly understood. For example, it is unknown where yeast killers occur and at what frequency, how evolvable killing ability is, whether it is constrained by possible trade-offs with resource competitive ability {{and how it is}} shaped by interactions with toxin-sensitive competitors. Also unknown is how stable yeast-virus symbioses are, and how coevolution between host and virus may affect this stability and the killing phenotype itself. It is believed that killer yeasts are common {{based on the fact that}} they have been found among yeasts isolated from different sources over several decades. In chapter 2, we assay two large yeast collections from diverse habitats, including nature and man-made habitats (in total 136 strains with known genome sequences), for killer phenotype and toxin resistance. We find that ~ 10. 3 % carry a killer virus, while about 25 % are resistant to at least one of the three known killer toxins (12. 5 % to different combinations of two and ~ 9 % to all three), most likely due to chromosomal mutations. Analyses of their evolutionary relationship indicate that host-virus associations are relatively short lived, whereas the relatively high frequency of resistance suggests that toxins have a substantial impact on yeast evolution. In order to understand the ecological and evolutionary role of toxin production, it is essential to reliably assess the killing rate of toxin producers by measuring how many toxin-sensitive individuals are killed by a single toxin producer during a given time interval. To identify a convenient method with high sensitivity and reproducibility, in chapter 3 we perform a systematic comparative analysis of four methods, including the conventional “Halo method” and three more quantitative liquid assays. We apply these methods to a set of three known yeast <b>killer</b> <b>strains</b> (K 1, K 2 and K 28) and find that the easy applicable Halo method provides the most sensitive and reproducible killing rate estimates (with best discrimination between <b>killer</b> <b>strains).</b> Understanding the evolution of the yeast-virus association is crucial for a full understanding of the ecological and evolutionary role of <b>killer</b> <b>strains.</b> In chapter 4, we present experimental tests of the strength of the dependence of yeast host <b>strains</b> on their <b>killer</b> viruses.  We cross-infect several viruses among <b>killer</b> <b>strains</b> of the genus Saccharomyces – all expressing the K 1 -type toxin, and test native and new combinations for the strength of host-virus co-adaptation. We find explicit host-virus co-adaptation, because native yeasts hosts display the highest toxicity and highest stability of killer viruses relative to hosts carrying non-native viruses. Even stronger, we find that curing these wild killer yeasts from their virus reduces their competitive fitness, despite initial fitness costs of viral carriage reported for constructed <b>killer</b> <b>strains.</b> These results demonstrate co-adaptation of host and virus in the natural <b>killer</b> <b>strains</b> resulting in their dependence on the killer virus. To explore the evolutionary costs and benefits of virus carriage and toxin production, and understand whether they are shaped by the coevolution between host and virus and the presence of toxin-sensitive competitors in the environment, we conduct a series of laboratory experiments where we manipulate the opportunity for coevolution (chapter 5). Analyses of killing ability, toxin sensitivity and fitness (i. e. resource competitive ability), show rapid reciprocal changes in <b>killer</b> and sensitive <b>strain</b> when coevolution is allowed, modulated by the rapid invasion of toxin-resistant mutants and subsequent reduction of killing ability. Remarkably, we find that the rapid invasion of toxin-resistant mutants involves two mutational steps, the first being a mutation showing a meiotic drive phenotype as well as a strong fitness benefit in heterozygotes, the second the resistance mutation. Shifts in the competitive fitness of evolved killer isolates with increased killing ability show a clear trade-off between killing rate and resource competitive ability, indicating that resource and interference competitive ability are alternative competitive strategies. Moreover, by cross-infecting the killer virus between the ancestral and an evolved strain, we are able to demonstrate the rapid co-adaptation between host and killer virus, supporting our previous findings of co-adaptive responses in wild yeast killers (chapter 4). Our analyses are based on screens of natural isolates, laboratory evolution experiments and phenotypic analyses, complemented by classical genetics. To more fully understand the reciprocal nature and molecular mechanisms of adaptive responses, genome analyses are required. The motivation for such analyses and other follow-up studies are proposed in chapter 6.  My studies show the usefulness of the killer yeast system to address questions related to interference competition and coevolution, which may proof valuable also given potential applications of killer yeasts in the fermentation industry.  ...|$|R
