5|$|In a {{situation}} analogous {{with that of}} other European countries, the progressive internal decay of the Polish Church created conditions favorable for the dissemination of the Reformation ideas and currents. For example, there was a chasm between the lower clergy and the nobility-based Church hierarchy, which was quite laicized and preoccupied with temporal issues, such as power and wealth, and often corrupt. The middle nobility, which had already {{been exposed to the}} Hussite reformist persuasion, increasingly looked at the Church's many privileges with <b>envy</b> <b>and</b> hostility.|$|E

5|$|In 1942, in {{its most}} {{significant}} schism, at least 250 members left the Church. Tensions began to build after Joaquín's birthday, when the congregation gave him gifts of flowers and sang hymns celebrating his birthday. This celebration generated a heated debate that culminated with the defection of several church members, including some pastors. Anthropologist Renée de la Torre described this schism as a power struggle in which Joaquín was accused of having enriched himself {{at the expense of}} the faithful. Church dissidents took to El Occidental to accuse members of La Luz del Mundo of committing immoralities with young women. Some of the accusations were aimed to close down a temple that LLDM used with government permission. Members of La Luz del Mundo attribute this episode to the <b>envy</b> <b>and</b> ambition of the dissidents, who formed their own group called El Buen Pastor (The Good Shepherd) under the leadership of José María González, with doctrines and practices similar to those of La Luz del Mundo. The leader is considered a prophet of God. As of 2010, El Buen Pastor Church has a membership of 17,700 in Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The Thule Society, led by Karl Haushofer and Dietlinde Eckhart, use <b>Envy</b> <b>and</b> Edward's kidnapped father Hohenheim as {{catalysts}} to open {{a portal}} to Edward's world, believing {{it to be the}} utopia Shamballa after learning about it from Hohenheim. A number of armored soldiers are sent through the portal, only to emerge on the other side in the city of Liore as mutated zombie-like creatures. Alphonse, who is visiting Liore, fights off the armored soldiers and merges parts of his soul to three of their suits to aid him in combat. Meanwhile, Edward breaks into the Thule Society headquarters and accidentally reopens the portal, returning the dead armored soldiers to Earth and allowing Alphonse's armored form to briefly reunite with his brother before his soul returns to his body, increasing Edward's determination to return to his world.|$|E
25|$|The study Cognitive Neuroscience of Social Emotions and Implications for Psychopathology: Examining Embarrassment, Guilt, <b>Envy,</b> <b>and</b> Schadenfreude (2014) {{identified}} neural correlations {{to specific}} social emotions (e.g. <b>envy</b> <b>and</b> embarrassment) {{as a measure}} of cognitive dissonance. The neural activity for the emotion of Envy (the feeling of displeasure at the good fortune of another person) was found to draw neural activity from the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. That such increased activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex occurred either when a person’s self-concept was threatened or when the person suffered embarrassment (social pain) caused by salient, upward social-comparison, by social-class snobbery. That social emotions, such as embarrassment, guilt, <b>envy,</b> <b>and</b> Schadenfreude (joy at the misfortune of another person) are correlated to reduced activity in the insular lobe, and with increased activity in the striate nucleus; those neural activities are associated with a reduced sense of empathy (social responsibility) and an increased propensity towards antisocial behavior (delinquency).|$|E

25|$|In later {{poetry of}} Rumi, Iblis appears {{not as the}} archdevil, who {{committed}} the first sin nor is he endowed to lead humans astray, instead evil evolved from humans own nature and are encouraged to avoid evil on their own.

25|$|Winnicott's {{theoretical}} elusiveness {{has been}} linked to his efforts to modify Kleinian views.

25|$|In Bunker's work, {{there is}} often an element of <b>envy</b> <b>and</b> disdain towards the normal people who live outside of this circle and hypocritically ensure that those caught in it have no way out.

25|$|Collingwood is {{traditionally}} reviled by non-Collingwood supporters ("You either love 'em or you hate 'em"). The dislike {{of the club}} by outsiders {{is said to have}} originated during the 1920s and 1930s, a period of great success for the club which drew the <b>envy</b> <b>and</b> resentment of other clubs. In this period, Collingwood was also perceived as a Catholic and Irish club, at a time when these groups were looked down upon by the rest of Australian society and subjected to a considerable degree of social exclusion.|$|E

25|$|The First Peloponnesian War (460–445 BC) {{was fought}} between Sparta as {{the leaders of}} the Peloponnesian League and Sparta's other allies, most notably Thebes, and the Delian League led by Athens with support from Argos. This war {{consisted}} of a series of conflicts and minor wars, such as the Second Sacred War. There were several causes for the war including the building of the Athenian long walls, Megara's defection and the <b>envy</b> <b>and</b> concern felt by Sparta at the growth of the Athenian Empire.|$|E

In 2008, a lifeguard diving at the site found an Ophthalmos, a 4th or 5th century BCE marble discus measuring 20cm in diameter. Resembling an eye, these adorned the bow of ancient ships and were supposed to protect the ships from the evil eye, <b>envy</b> <b>and</b> danger, while also assisting navigation.|$|E

25|$|It was {{designed}} by Hikmet Topuzer, nicknamed Topuz Hikmet, who played as left winger, in 1910, and had made as lapel pins by Tevfik Haccar Taşçı (then Tevfik Haccar) in London. The crest consists of five colours. The white section which includes the writing Fenerbahçe Spor Kulübü ★ 1907 ★ represents purity and open-heartedness, the red section represents love and attachment to the club and symbolises the Turkish flag. The yellow section symbolises other ones' <b>envy</b> <b>and</b> jealousy about Fenerbahçe, while the navy symbolises nobility. The oak leaf which rises from the navy and yellow section shows the force {{and the power of}} being a member of Fenerbahçe. The green colour of the leaf shows the success of Fenerbahçe is imperative.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{necessary}} for the seeker to have a correct creed (Aqidah), and to embrace with certainty its tenets. The seeker must also, of necessity, turn away from sins, love of this world, the love of company and renown, obedience to satanic impulse, and the promptings of the lower self. (The way in which this purification of the heart is achieved is outlined in certain books, but must be prescribed in detail by a Sufi master.) The seeker must also be trained to prevent the corruption of those good deeds which have accrued {{to his or her}} credit by overcoming the traps of ostentation, pride, arrogance, <b>envy,</b> <b>and</b> long hopes (meaning the hope for a long life allowing us to mend our ways later, rather than immediately, here and now).|$|E
25|$|Caccini's {{character}} {{seems to}} have been less than perfectly honorable, as he was frequently motivated by <b>envy</b> <b>and</b> jealousy, not only in his professional life but for personal advancement with the Medici. On one occasion, he informed to the Grand Duke Francesco on two lovers in the Medici householdEleonora, the wife of Pietro de' Medici, who was having an illicit affair with Bernardino Antinoriand his informing led directly to Eleonora's murder by Pietro. His rivalry with both Emilio de' Cavalieri and Jacopo Peri {{seems to have}} been intense: he may have been the one who arranged for Cavalieri to be removed from his post as director of festivities for the wedding of Henry IV of France and Maria de' Medici in 1600 (an event which caused Cavalieri to leave Florence in fury), and he also seems to have rushed his own opera Euridice into print before Peri's opera on the same subject could be published, while simultaneously ordering his group of singers to {{have nothing to do with}} Peri's production.|$|E
