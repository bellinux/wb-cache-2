5|$|The silk industry, however, did {{not gain}} any benefit from {{innovations}} in spinning, as silk is naturally already a thread. Making silk, silver, and gold brocades {{is a very}} delicate and precise process, with each colour needing its own dedicated shuttle. In the 17th century and 18th centuries progress began {{to be made in}} the simplification and standardization of silk manufacture, with many advances following one after another. Bouchon and Falcon's punched card loom appeared in 1775, later improved on by Jacques de Vaucanson. Later, Joseph-Marie <b>Jacquard</b> improved on the designs of Falcon and Vaucanson, introducing the revolutionary <b>Jacquard</b> loom, which allowed a string of punched cards to be processed mechanically in the correct sequence. The punched cards of the <b>Jacquard</b> loom were a direct precursor to the modern computer, in that they gave a (limited) form of programmability. Punched cards themselves were carried over to computers, and were ubiquitous until their obsolescence in the 1970s. From 1801 embroidery became highly mechanized due to the effectiveness of the <b>Jacquard</b> loom. The mechanism behind the <b>Jacquard</b> loom even allowed complex designs to be mass-produced.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Jacquard</b> loom was {{immediately}} denounced by workers, who accused it of causing unemployment, but soon {{it had become}} vital to the industry. The loom was declared public property in 1806, and <b>Jacquard</b> was rewarded with a pension and a royalty on each machine. In 1834 there were a total of 2885 <b>Jacquard</b> looms in Lyon alone. The Canut revolt in 1831 foreshadowed many of the larger worker uprisings of the Industrial Revolution. The canuts occupied the city of Lyon, and would not relinquish it until a bloody repression by the army, led by Marshal Soult. A second revolt, similar to the first, took place in 1834.|$|E
5|$|The Industrial Revolution {{changed much}} of Europe’s silk industry. Due to {{innovations}} on spinning cotton, cotton became much cheaper to manufacture and therefore caused more expensive silk production to become less mainstream. New weaving technologies, however, increased {{the efficiency of}} production. Among these was the <b>Jacquard</b> loom, developed for silk embroidery. An epidemic of several silkworm diseases caused production to fall, especially in France, where the industry never recovered. In the 20th century Japan and China regained their earlier role in silk production, and China is now once again the world’s largest producer of silk. The rise of new fabrics such as nylon reduced the prevalence of silk throughout the world, and silk is now once again a rare luxury good, much less important than in its heyday.|$|E
25|$|In 1837, Charles Babbage was {{inspired}} by <b>Jacquard's</b> loom to attempt to build the Analytical Engine.|$|R
5000|$|His book, <b>Jacquard's</b> Web, {{develops}} {{from his}} involvement writing a computer history book about Charles Babbage, The Cogwheel Brain, with Dr. Doron Swade [...] His own research starts earlier and covers {{the role of}} <b>Jacquard's</b> Loom cards (the idea which Babbage used for his first 'computers', the Difference Engine and the Analytical Engine), which were the precursors of the first programming languages, a significance recognised by Babbage's friend, Ada Lovelace.|$|R
5000|$|By this time, {{the first}} {{mechanical}} devices {{driven by a}} binary pattern had been invented. The industrial revolution had driven forward the mechanization of many tasks, and this included weaving. Punched cards controlled Joseph Marie <b>Jacquard's</b> loom in 1801, where a hole punched in the card indicated a binary one and an unpunched spot indicated a binary zero. <b>Jacquard's</b> loom was {{far from being a}} computer, but it did illustrate that machines could be driven by binary systems [...]|$|R
25|$|Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers in Paris. His {{original}} automata {{have all}} been lost. The flute player and the tambourine player were reportedly destroyed in the Revolution. His proposals for the automation of the weaving process, although ignored during his lifetime, were later perfected and implemented by Joseph Marie <b>Jacquard,</b> {{the creator of the}} <b>Jacquard</b> loom.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} programmable machines {{preceded the}} invention of the digital computer. In 1801, Joseph-Marie <b>Jacquard</b> devised a loom that would weave a pattern by following a series of perforated cards. Patterns could be woven and repeated by arranging the cards.|$|E
25|$|The {{hand loom}} with <b>jacquard</b> is a wooden hand loom {{typical of the}} many {{thousands}} of looms {{that were used in}} the domestic cottage industry throughout the British Isles. They were gradually replaced by all-metal looms (see the Hattersley domestic loom) and new methods of working practice, such as the factory system, during the Industrial Revolution. The loom has a four-shuttle drop box to weave up to four colours of weft, and has John Kay's flying shuttle method of inserting the weft. Most of the handlooms used in the home were ordinary shaft looms. These do not require roof space and would be weaving standard cloths, unlike this loom which is fitted with a 360 hook de Vogue <b>jacquard</b> and can weave very complex fabrics.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jacquard's</b> {{invention}} {{had a deep}} {{influence on}} Charles Babbage. In that respect, he is viewed by some authors as a precursor of modern computing science.|$|R

25|$|The John Lewis Partnership {{currently}} operates one manufacturing business, Herbert Parkinson, in Darwen, Lancashire. This company, {{established as}} a weaver of <b>jacquard</b> fabrics in 1934, was acquired by the Partnership in 1953. Herbert Parkinson currently produce John Lewis own-brand fabrics and curtains as well as filled furnishing products such as cushions and pillows. The company operates a wholesale business to outside customers in addition to supplying John Lewis branches.|$|E
25|$|The Lancashire Loom was {{the first}} {{semi-automatic}} loom. <b>Jacquard</b> looms and Dobby looms are looms that have sophisticated methods of shedding. They may be separate looms, or mechanisms added to a plain loom. A Northrop Loom was fully automatic and was mass produced between 1909 and the mid-1960s. Modern looms run faster and do not use a shuttle: there are air jet looms, water jet looms and rapier looms.|$|E
25|$|Moss {{has been}} the subject of portraits by artists such as Lucian Freud and Chuck Close. In 2005, a {{painting}} of Moss by Freud sold for £3.93million at Christie's. Close has taken daguerreotypes of Moss, which he has also translated into <b>Jacquard</b> tapestry. In October 2010, she appeared on the cover of Bryan Ferry's album Olympia. The National Portrait Gallery, London maintains seven portraits of Moss among its collections, shot by photographers including Mario Testino, Corinne Day and Sølve Sundsbø.|$|E
50|$|By raising {{different}} (not just alternate) {{warp threads}} and using colored threads in the weft, the texture, color, design, and pattern can be varied to create varied and highly desirable fabrics. Weaving elaborate patterns or designs manually is a slow, complicated procedure subject to error. <b>Jacquard’s</b> loom {{was intended to}} automate this process.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} {{incorporated}} in 1896/7, {{when it was}} spinning medium counts and weaving fancies such as <b>Jacquards,</b> satteens, drillettes and velvets. The company closed in 1930, and though part of the 1831 mill remained until 1987 it has all been demolished except the chimney which has been preserved as local landmark.|$|R

25|$|The Brussels Loom was {{introduced}} into England towards {{the middle of}} the eighteenth century marked {{the beginning of a new}} era in carpet-weaving. It was the first loom on which a pile carpet could be woven mechanically, the pile consisting of rows of loops, formed over wires inserted weftwise during weaving and subsequently withdrawn. Brussels was the first type of carpet to be woven in a loom incorporating the <b>jacquard</b> pattern selecting mechanism and in 1849 power was applied to the loom by Biglow in the U.S.A.|$|E
25|$|In 1804, Joseph-Marie <b>Jacquard</b> {{developed}} a loom {{in which the}} pattern being woven was controlled by a paper tape constructed from punched cards. The paper tape could be changed without changing the mechanical design of the loom. This was a landmark achievement in programmability. His machine was an improvement over similar weaving looms. Punched cards were preceded by punch bands, as in the machine proposed by Basile Bouchon. These bands would inspire information recording for automatic pianos and more recently numerical control machine tools.|$|E
25|$|After homage by dignitaries, {{several hundred}} {{ordinary}} Parisians (among them professor Albert <b>Jacquard,</b> who {{struggled with the}} Abbé {{for the cause of}} homelessness) went to the Val-de-Grâce chapel to see Abbé Pierre's corpse. His funeral on 26 January 2007 at the Cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris was attended by numerous distinguished people: President Jacques Chirac, former President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin, many French Ministers, and of course the Companions of Emmaus, who were placed {{at the front of the}} congregation in the cathedral, according to Abbé Pierre's last wishes. He was buried in a cemetery in Esteville, a small village in Seine-Maritime where he used to live. Cardinal Philippe Barbarin, archbishop of Lyon, evoked a possible beatification, but it seems unlikely in the near future.|$|E
25|$|Woven wraps are {{pieces of}} woven fabric of varying thickness. Natural fibers are usually chosen, with cotton {{being the most}} common, but hemp, linen, silk and wool are also used. A variety of weaves are used. Most common are {{homespun}} or handwoven fabrics with simple over-under weaves, twills and <b>jacquards.</b> Most weaves provide some give or stretch diagonally.|$|R

50|$|Some early computers, {{such as the}} 1944 IBM Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator (Harvard Mark I) {{received}} {{program instructions}} from a paper tape punched with holes, similar to <b>Jacquard's</b> string of cards. Later computers executed programs from higher-speed memory, though cards were commonly used to load the programs into memory. Punched cards remained in use in computing up until the mid 1980s.|$|R
25|$|From October 1995, the V6 {{models were}} simply {{known as the}} Vienta—losing the Camry {{identity}} altogether. The availability of manual transmission on the CSi and Touring Series V6 sedan variants coincided with the update, while the V6 Grande superseded the V6 Ultima. Perforated leather upholstery and wood grain trim on the Grande was optional. Towards {{the end of the}} model run, special edition Getaway (October 1996) and Intrigue (April 1997) sedan models were launched. Based on the CSi, the Getaway was further equipped with 14-inch alloy wheels, a CD player and air conditioning. Also based on the CSi, the Intrigue added air conditioning, CD player, <b>Jacquard</b> upholstery, extra seat-back map pockets, and 15-inch wheels. Toyota fitted the four-cylinder Intrigue with the same wheel covers as the Vienta CSi, with the Vienta Intrigue upgraded to alloy wheels.|$|E
25|$|The {{biggest change}} to the room was in the window treatments. Jacqueline Kennedy {{specifically}} asked for new curtains for the East Room consisting of opaque silk undercurtains and yellow drapes. Boudin oversaw the design of new draperies, with silk provided by Maison Jansen. A draft design of the drapes and valances was not ready until mid-1963. Boudin, apparently wishing {{to draw attention to}} the center window between the fireplaces, designed a valance for the center window while putting all other drapes behind window boxes. For the drapes, Boudin suggested a braid border and tie-backs made of ball fringe covered in satin. Kennedy disapproved of Boudin's proposal for the valance and window boxes, as it did not make use of the historic 1902 gilt window cornices. She did, however, approve of the fabric and tie-backs. Made of a custom-manufactured gold and cream silk lampas, the fabric contained a non-repetitive design of birds, butterflies, cupids, flowers, medallions, roosters, and wheat and featured heavy fringe at the bottom. The drapes were hung in straight panels from the carved and gilded 1902 wooden cornices. The design of the valances was not finalized until April 1964. First Lady Lady Bird Johnson asked Jacqueline Kennedy to assist her in finalizing the design. Originally, they were to be of brocatelle, a <b>jacquard</b> weave fabric similar to brocade but thicker and heavier and with designs in high relief. But this design was countermanded by Boudin. Instead, gold lampas, trimmed with braid and hemmed with gilt, spun-metal twisted fringe at the bottom, was installed in flat panels from behind each cornice. The curtains and valances took nearly three years to design and manufacture, and were not hung in the room until the Johnson administration in 1965. The drapes and valances cost $26,149. The cost was covered by sales of Jacqueline Kennedy's guidebook to the White House, which by 1965 was in its fourth edition.|$|E

25|$|The 19th century {{also saw}} the designs of Charles Babbage calculating machines, first with his {{difference}} engine, started in 1822, {{which was the first}} automatic calculator since it continuously used the results of the previous operation for the next one, and second with his analytical engine, which was the first programmable calculator, using <b>Jacquard's</b> cards to read program and data, that he started in 1834, and which gave the blueprint of the mainframe computers built {{in the middle of the}} 20th century.|$|R
25|$|The major {{innovation}} {{was that}} the Analytical Engine was to be programmed using punched cards: the Engine was intended to use loops of <b>Jacquard's</b> punched cards to control a mechanical calculator, which could use as input the results of preceding computations. The machine was also intended to employ several features subsequently used in modern computers, including sequential control, branching and looping. It {{would have been the}} first mechanical device to be, in principle, Turing-complete. The Engine was not a single physical machine, but rather a succession of designs that Babbage tinkered with until his death in 1871.|$|R

40|$|Lee Alexander McQueen {{was born}} in London on 17 March 1969. Despite his {{untimely}} death in 2010, his life's work has much to celebrate. McQueen was a complex, creative and driven man; perhaps even a visionary.
