5|$|Kōhei {{is living}} {{a normal life}} in high school with Mizuka, and gets to know five other girls {{throughout}} the story who he helps with their various personal problems. While Kōhei likes to joke and tease these girls, deep down he is nice to girls and genuinely wants to help them. In the story, Kōhei is able to form <b>intimate</b> <b>relationships</b> with the six heroines: Mizuka Nagamori, Rumi Nanase, Misaki Kawana, Mio Kouzuki, Mayu Shiina, and Akane Satomura. While a given relationship will start out well, before long those around him start to forget him as he begins to retreat further into the Eternal World. If Kōhei forms a strong bond {{with one of the}} girls, she alone remembers him even after he leaves to the Eternal World. This ensures his eventual return one year later when he and the girl reunite.|$|E
5|$|Megadeth's lyrics often {{focus on}} death, war, politics, and religion. The lyricism centers on nihilistic themes, but {{occasionally}} deals with {{topics such as}} alienation and social problems. The earliest releases featured themes such as occultism, graphic violence, and Satanism. Nuclear warfare and government conspiracy were preoccupations on albums such as Rust in Peace and Countdown to Extinction. During Megadeth's commercial peak, Mustaine elaborated on more personal themes such as addiction and <b>intimate</b> <b>relationships.</b> For the lyrics on Cryptic Writings, Mustaine said {{that he wanted to}} write songs that had more appeal to a wider audience. The title of United Abominations is a satiric play on the name of the United Nations; Mustaine criticized the organization's ineffectiveness on a number of songs on that album. Later albums contained lyrics in a similar vein.|$|E

To {{describe}} and explore how partners rate their <b>intimate</b> <b>relationship</b> {{before and after the}} patients' first myocardial infarction. A further aim was to investigate the association between partners' rating of their <b>intimate</b> <b>relationship</b> and self-rated health. Background. To date, information on how partners experience the <b>intimate</b> <b>relationship</b> before and after a patient's myocardial infarction is sparse. Design. A descriptive and exploratory design with longitudinal data collection. Methods. The study comprised 127 partners, aged 34 - 87 years. Data collection included self-reported information on socio-demographic data, <b>intimate</b> <b>relationship</b> and self-rated health one year before and one year after patients' first myocardial infarction. <b>Intimate</b> <b>relationship</b> was assessed by the Swedish version of the Relationship Assessment Scale. Self-rated health was evaluated by the Euro-QoL visual analogue scale. Results. In general, partners reported high satisfaction with their <b>intimate</b> <b>relationship</b> {{both before and after the}} patients' myocardial infarction. Women reported somewhat lower ratings in their <b>intimate</b> <b>relationship</b> than men before the myocardial infarction. Women increased their ratings after one year, while men on average decreased their ratings. Partners with higher education reported lower ratings for <b>intimate</b> <b>relationship</b> after one year. Those with children living at home rated <b>intimate</b> <b>relationship</b> lower than those without children living at home after one year. Partners' self-rated health status was stable over time. No significant association between <b>intimate</b> <b>relationship</b> and self-rated health was found. Conclusions. This study provides important insights regarding couples' relationships from the perspective of the partner. Socio-demographic factors such as sex, educational level, having children living at home and employment status may influence how the relationship, from the partners' perspective, is affected by a myocardial infarction event. Relevance to clinical practice. This study provides insight into how partners rate their <b>intimate</b> <b>relationship</b> and self-rated health over time before and after patients' myocardial infarction.

40|$|Background: <b>Intimate</b> <b>relationship</b> {{violence}} is physical, psychological or sexual violence {{that a person}} is exposed to in a relationship. There is a strong correlation between <b>intimate</b> <b>relationship</b> violence and mental health problems. A psychiatric ward at a hospital in Sweden, is working with a new routine. According to this routine every new patient should be asked about intmate relationship violence {{as a part of the}} admission interview. Objective: The objective of this study was to study how the healthcare personnel is working with the routine, and also to study response rate, interventions and how the work has developed over time. Method: A quantitative study with a retrospective and descriptive studydesign. One hundred and two medical records were reviewed. Frequency concerning how many times the question about <b>intimate</b> <b>relationship</b> violence was asked, and patients answerer were registered, along with interventions and the development of the routine over time. Results: Out of 102 reviewed medical records, 70 patients (69 %) were asked about <b>intimate</b> <b>relationship</b> violence and 38, 5 % of those answered that they had been exposed to <b>intimate</b> <b>relationship</b> violence. During January the highest percentage (74 %) of patients were asked and the lowest percentage was in December (60 %). Conclusion: The majority of patients are asked about <b>intimate</b> <b>relationship</b> violence when the question becomes a routine in the medical anamnesis. A high percentage of the patients answered that they had been exposed to <b>intimate</b> <b>relationship</b> violence, but no interventions only concerning <b>intimate</b> <b>relationship</b> violence was registered. A higher percentage of patients were asked in March compared to December, wich implies that the work has improved over time.

25|$|A {{marriage}} {{in which both}} spouses agree ahead of time to accept sexual relations by either partner with others is {{sometimes referred to as}} an open marriage or the swinging lifestyle. Polyamory, meaning the practice, desire, or acceptance of <b>intimate</b> <b>relationships</b> that are not exclusive with respect to other sexual or <b>intimate</b> <b>relationships,</b> with knowledge and consent of everyone involved, sometimes involves such marriages. Swinging and open marriages are both a form of non-monogamy, and the spouses would not view the sexual relations as objectionable. However, irrespective of the stated views of the partners, extra-marital relations could still be considered a crime in some legal jurisdictions which criminalize adultery.|$|E

40|$|Using a {{developmental}} systems perspective and public-use longitudinal data from participants currently {{in a romantic}} relationship at Wave 4 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (n = 2, 970), the current study explored direct and indirect paths from parent–adolescent relationship quality to young adult <b>intimate</b> <b>relationship</b> quality. Structural equation mod-eling tested whether mental health (depressive symptoms and self-esteem) in the transition to adulthood mediated the association between parent–adolescent relations and young adult intimate relations. The results indicated that higher quality parent–adolescent relations pre-dicted higher self-esteem and lower depressive symptoms during the transition to adulthood as well as higher young adult <b>intimate</b> <b>relationship</b> quality, controlling for adolescent mental health and parent–young adult relationship quality. Higher self-esteem during the transition to adulthood was associated with greater <b>intimate</b> <b>relationship</b> quality, whereas greater depres-sive symptomatology predicted reduced <b>intimate</b> <b>relationship</b> quality.

25|$|Attachment theory, an {{influential}} theoretical {{framework for the}} study of <b>intimate</b> <b>relationships</b> and personality development, argues that all humans are born with the capacity and motivation to engage in caregiving behaviours aimed at providing protection and support to close others. These behaviours are organized by an innate behavioural system, called the caregiving system, which is believed to have emerged over the course of primate evolution to ensure the survival of vulnerable offspring. That is, because infants in many primate species, including humans, are highly altricial (i.e., developmentally immature and helpless at birth), they cannot survive without caregiver support and protection. Attachment theory proposes that this evolutionary pressure favoured the emergence of the caregiving behavioural system, which functions to safeguard the vulnerable dependent from harm by providing him or her with protection, comfort, and help during times of threat or need. Although this system was first conceptualized in child–parent bonds, its operation has since been established in adult <b>intimate</b> <b>relationships,</b> where both partners may occasionally take on the role of caregiver.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to giving support and reassurance during distress, another important function of caregiving within <b>intimate</b> <b>relationships</b> is {{the provision of}} support for a relationship partner's personal growth, exploration, and goal strivings. In attachment theory, this type of support is called providing a secure base and is postulated to encourage the relationship partner's confident, autonomous exploration of the environment outside of the attachment relationship. This phenomenon was originally observed in young children; children whose parents showed more intrusiveness {{were less likely to}} engage in play and exploration in a novel environment.|$|E
25|$|Caring in <b>intimate</b> <b>relationships</b> is the {{practice}} of providing care and support to an intimate relationship partner. Caregiving behaviours are aimed at reducing the partner's distress and supporting his or her coping efforts in situations of either threat or challenge. Caregiving may include emotional support (expressions of care, affection, sympathy, and encouragement) and/or instrumental support (provision of information, advice, and tangible resources). Effective caregiving behaviour enhances the care-recipient's psychological well-being, {{as well as the}} quality {{of the relationship between the}} caregiver and the care-recipient. However, certain suboptimal caregiving strategies may be either ineffective or even detrimental to coping.|$|E
