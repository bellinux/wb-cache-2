40|$|It is now {{common for}} {{policy-makers}} and researchers to emphasise {{the need for}} clusters to combine geographically broader linkages, with clusters in other regions and countries, with local linkages within the cluster. This has resulted in policies designed to encourage the establishment of broader linkages, such as the European Commission's encouragement of trans-national links between European clusters through its <b>Europe</b> <b>INNOVA</b> initiatives. However, through {{an examination of the}} 'Small World' network concept, this article suggests that clusters' internal dynamics could be undermined by such policies and that they should therefore be implemented with caution. ...|$|E
40|$|Global {{economic}} and financial crisis afflict the construction sector and induce a fall in investment {{and a decline in}} value estimates of property, especially of existing buildings. This decrease was detected not only in Italy but generally speaking, throughout Europe and in many other countries. Against this government facilities and research organizations work to identify prospects and construct pathways needed to overcome the crisis. In this paper are taken into account, in particular, two documents: • Sectorial Innovation Watch, Construction Sector (<b>Europe</b> <b>Innova),</b> drawn up by the UE • Global Agenda for Revaluing Construction, draw up by the International Council for Research in Building and Construction (CIB) The analysis of these documents guides to the identification of those can be considered as new "invisible technologies" useful to guide the construction sector out of crisis. The tools to do this may be the methods of indicators, methods for assessing the sustainability of the built environment. The scenarios of the European Union, the proposals of the CIB and methods for indicators are tools to operate in the rehabilitation and upgrading of existing buildings, but these tools define also a design methodology that is complex and new as the higher the number of stakeholders and information to manage. This methodology, however, has a historical reference in the studies that preceded and, in part, accompanied the post-conflict reconstruction in Italy, the reconstruction has built {{a large part of the}} building which now needs new policies for the redevelopment. Economic capital and social capital related to buildings to be redeveloped may increase the economic value of the construction industry and lead the market towards the exit from the crisis, this can only happen through dialogue and shared management of information...|$|E
40|$|SMEs play an {{important}} role in the development of regional innovative systems because of their potential to accept new technologies and show fast growing rates. There is an interdependence between emergence of fast growing SMEs (?gazelles?) and innovative development of regions. High level of regional innovative development creates a fertile environment for increasing the number of fast growing companies, while we assume that large number of ?gazelles? creates a favourable environment for the dissemination of innovations in regions via spillover effect (NESTA Business growth and innovation, 2009). Fast-growing companies may contribute more than 50 % to GDP growth (<b>Europe</b> <b>INNOVA</b> Gazelles Innovation Panel, 2008). There are several works, that explain growth of firms as a stochastic phenomenon (Gibrat, 1929), or as a combination of endogenous (Penrose, 1955) and exogenous factors (Delmar, Davidsson, Gartner, 2003). In our work we assume that regional innovation performance (as a share of RnD personnel in employment, share RnD expenditures in gross regional product, etc.) may be a significant factor because of knowledge spillover effects (Audretsch, Feldman, 2004), affecting more competitive firms. There were no works on Russian regional data that could prove it. The article analyses a variety of endogenous (intra-firm) and exogenous (regional) factors, which determine the share of fast-growing firms in Russian regions. The analysed firms were fast-growing manufacturing SMEs during post-crisis period (2009 - 2012), the main focus was on the determinants of the companies? share in total number of manufacturing firms in a region. The dataset was collected from SPARK (Professional market and company analysis system), and consists of information about income, owners, location, industry and several financial indicators. Regional factors, according to Russian Federal State Statistical service, include research and development indicators (such as RnD expenditures, RnD employees, etc.), urbanization rate, human capital, investment climate, etc. There are 419 manufacturing fast-growing companies (?gazelles?) from 9220 companies in database, which is approximately 5 %. Econometric analyses demonstrates a strong correlation between the share of high-growth companies in regions and indicators of regional innovation performance: number of researchers per 10 000 people, the number of PCT applications per economically active population, the share of employees with higher education in the total number of population in economically active age, and the number of applications for inventions submitted to the Russian Patent Bureau by national applicants per the economically active population. Determined factors could be used for elaborating recommendations for implementation of industrial policy in Russia...|$|E
5000|$|Launched on March 5, 1992, the (Ascot Innova) {{was also}} based on the CB Accord underpinnings, but was given an all-new, modern-looking and rounded body, with styling similar to the Honda Prelude BB4 series (1992-1996). It {{was the result of}} a joint effort with the Rover Group that {{provided}} Rover with the 600 series, and an Accord that was unique to <b>Europe.</b> The <b>Innova</b> retained the original Ascot's six-light greenhouse layout and horizontal taillights, as well as long, sleek and low body proportions (as opposed to the second-generation Ascot's upright stance and more Accord CF-like rear end). The Innova was fitted with frameless side glazing to provide for the [...] "pillared hardtop" [...] look, thus being Honda's answer to cars like the Toyota Carina ED/Toyota Corona EXiV, Nissan Bluebird ARX and Mitsubishi Emeraude. The Ascot Innova was sold in conjunction to the Ascot, and did not replace it.|$|R
