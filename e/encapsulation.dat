5|$|Optical properties, {{including}} the PL efficiency, {{can be modified}} by encapsulating organic dyes (carotene, lycopene, etc.) inside the tubes. Efficient energy transfer occurs between the encapsulated dye and nanotube — light is efficiently absorbed by the dye and without significant loss is transferred to the SWCNT. Thus potentially, optical properties of a carbon nanotube can be controlled by encapsulating certain molecule inside it. Besides, <b>encapsulation</b> allows isolation and characterization of organic molecules which are unstable under ambient conditions. For example, Raman spectra are extremely difficult to measure from dyes because of their strong PL (efficiency close to 100%). However, <b>encapsulation</b> of dye molecules inside SWCNTs completely quenches dye PL, thus allowing measurement and analysis of their Raman spectra.|$|E
5|$|A non-pegylated {{liposomal}} doxorubicin, called Myocet, {{is approved}} in Europe and Canada {{for treatment of}} metastatic breast cancer in combination with cyclophosphamide, but has not {{been approved by the}} FDA for use in the United States. Unlike Doxil, the Myocet liposome does not have a polyethylene glycol coating, and therefore does not result in the same rate of hand-foot syndrome. The minimization of this side effect may allow for one-for-one (1:1) substitution with doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby improving safety with no loss of efficacy. Like Doxil, the liposomal <b>encapsulation</b> of the doxorubicin limits the cardiotoxicity. In theory, by limiting the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin through liposomal <b>encapsulation,</b> it can be used safely in concurrent combination with other cardiotoxic chemotherapy drugs, such as trastuzumab. There is an FDA black box warning that trastuzumab cannot be used in concurrent combination with doxorubicin, only in sequential combination. Though concurrent combination of trastuzumab and doxorubicin in clinical studies found superior tumor response, the combination resulted in unacceptable cardiotoxicity, including risk of cardiac failure manifesting as congestive heart failure (CHF). Published phase II study results have shown that Myocet, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel can safely be used concurrently without the cardiac risk, as measured by reduction in LVEF function, while still achieving superior tumor response. This finding is the basis for the ongoing phase III trial for FDA approval.|$|E
5|$|Doxorubicin is {{also known}} to be fluorescent. This has often been used to {{characterize}} doxorubicin concentrations, and has opened {{the possibility of using}} the molecule as a theranostic agent. However, there are significant limitations, as doxorubicin's fluorescence spectrum is known to depend on a variety of factors, including the pH of the environment, solvent dielectric constant and others. Doxorubicin fluorescence is quenched by binding to DNA, and shielded by micelle <b>encapsulation.</b> It {{is also known}} to self-quench at high concentrations. In contrast, histone binding amplifies fluorescence.|$|E

5|$|Fodor {{revived the}} idea of modularity, without the notion of precise {{physical}} localizability, in the 1980s, {{and became one of}} the most vocal proponents of it with the 1983 publication of his monograph Modularity of Mind. Two properties of modularity in particular, informational <b>encapsulation</b> and domain specificity, make it possible to tie together questions of functional architecture with those of mental content. The ability to elaborate information independently from the background beliefs of individuals that these two properties allow Fodor to give an atomistic and causal account of the notion of mental content. The main idea, in other words, is that the properties of the contents of mental states can depend, rather than exclusively on the internal relations of the system of which they are a part, also on their causal relations with the external world.|$|E
5|$|The {{diseases}} and parasites that affect octopuses have been little studied, but cephalopods {{are known to}} be the intermediate or final hosts of various parasitic cestodes, nematodes and copepods; 150 species of protistan and metazoan parasites have been recognised. The Dicyemidae are a family of tiny worms that are found in the renal appendages of many species; it is unclear whether they are parasitic or are endosymbionts. Coccidians in the genusAggregata living in the gut cause severe disease to the host. Octopuses have an innate immune system, and the haemocytes respond to infection by phagocytosis, <b>encapsulation,</b> infiltration or cytotoxic activities to destroy or isolate the pathogens. The haemocytes {{play an important role in}} the recognition and elimination of foreign bodies and wound repair. Captive animals have been found to be more susceptible to pathogens than wild ones. A gram-negative bacterium, Vibrio lentus, has been found to cause skin lesions, exposure of muscle and death of octopuses in extreme cases.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—While in {{computer}} networks {{the number of}} possible protocol <b>encapsulations</b> is growing day after day, network administrators face ever increasing difficulties in selecting accurately the traffic they need to inspect. This is mainly caused by {{the limited number of}} <b>encapsulations</b> supported by currently available tools and the difficulty to exactly specify which packets have to be analyzed, especially in presence of tunneled traffic. This paper presents a novel packet processing language that, besides Boolean filtering predicates, introduces special constructs for handling the more complex situations of tunneled and stacked <b>encapsulations,</b> giving the user a finer control over the semantics of a filtering expression. Even though this language is principally focused on packet filters, it is designed to support other advanced packet processing mechanisms such as traffic classification and field extraction. I...|$|R

25|$|<b>Encapsulation</b> is the hiding of {{information}} to ensure that data structures and operators are used as intended {{and to make the}} usage model more obvious to the developer. C++ provides the ability to define classes and functions as its primary <b>encapsulation</b> mechanisms. Within a class, members can be declared as either public, protected, or private to explicitly enforce <b>encapsulation.</b> A public member of the class is accessible to any function. A private member is accessible only to functions that are members of that class and to functions and classes explicitly granted access permission by the class ("friends"). A protected member is accessible to members of classes that inherit from the class in addition to the class itself and any friends.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{investigate}} the PV-module energy output losses due to reflection and absorption, particularly for oblique incident insolation, since perpendicular incidence is considered at STC-rating. A set up to measure the relative transmittance of PV-module <b>encapsulations</b> has been put up and measurements have been compared with simulation calculations. The relative transmittance has been weighted with the angular distribution of irradiance for different locations to obtain yearly and seasonal energy rating. The additional energy losses due to oblique incidence {{has been shown to be}} dependent on the inclination and location of the module. For Freiburg the calculations yield an additional loss of 4. 2 % for a South oriented 90 ° inclined surface.
