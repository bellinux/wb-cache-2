A wide variety of metal foils of varying thickness are available {{from which to choose}} and create a flex circuit, however copper foils, serve the vast majority of all flexible circuit applications. Copper’s excellent balance of cost and physical and electrical performance attributes make it an excellent choice. There are actually many different types of copper foil. The IPC identifies eight different types of copper foil for printed circuits divided into two much broader categories, electrodeposited and wrought, each having four sub-types.) As a result, {{there are a number of}} different types of copper foil available for flex circuit applications to serve the varied purposes of different end products. With most copper foil, a thin surface treatment is commonly applied to one side of the foil to improve its adhesion to the base film. Copper foils are of two basic types: wrought (rolled) and electrodeposited and their properties are quite different. Rolled and annealed foils are the most common choice, however thinner films which are electroplated are becoming increasingly popular.|$|E

A numerical model is developed using a combination of aerodynamic model based on BEMT, and structural model based on anisotropic beam finite element, in order to evaluate the coupled structural and the aerodynamic characteristics of the deformable proprotor blade.

40|$|Abstract. There is {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} use of <b>flexible</b> <b>laminate</b> composite materials to improve the deployable structures for space applications. Critical to acceptance of these materials is the ability to achieve high packaging strains without damage. However, there does exist more or less damage during the process of folding and unfolding for the laminate composites. Better understanding of folding damage, therefore, is needed for the design of laminate composites and folding pattern. In this work we present a study on the fold-resistant characteristics of two different laminate composites, which were fabricated by covering the aramid fiber/epoxy and carbon fiber/epoxy prepregs respectively with polyimide film on both sides. The results of tensile tests on 3 -layer structure laminate composites show that the fold-resistant properties of aramid fiber/epoxy composites could be improved with increasing of the resin content and decreasing of the fiber bundle diameter. For carbon fiber/epoxy composites, the effects of resin content and fiber bundle diameter on reduction rate of fracture strength were more complex. There existed a best range of resin content and fiber bundle diameter. The microscopic observations show that folding resulted in piling up of resin and damage of reinforcing fiber, which would decrease the mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|Pressure {{ischemia}} is {{a medical}} condition characterised by the necrosis of the skin and underlying tissues in body areas exposed to prolonged pressure. This condition leads {{to the development of}} bedsores and affects 9 % of hospitalised patients, costing the NHS between £ 1. 4 and £ 2. 1 billion per year. The severity of pressure ischemia has been linked to the concentration of sweat lactate, a product of sweat gland metabolism under anaerobic conditions, such as hypoxia. Normal levels of lactate in human sweat are 20 ± 7 mM, but under ischemic conditions these can rise up to approximately 70 mM. This project presents the development of a novel flexible electrochemical enzyme-based biosensor for the continuous and non-invasive monitoring of sweat lactate with the potential for becoming a body-worn device for the early detection of pressure ischemia onset. The core of the recognition system is a <b>flexible</b> <b>laminate,</b> comprising two highly porous polycarbonate membranes, which provide support for the lactate oxidase enzyme, immobilised via covalent cross-linking. Oxidation of lactate produces H 2 O 2, which is subsequently determined electrochemically. The transducer comprises a two-electrode system on a single flexible polycarbonate membrane, sputter-coated with gold (CE/RE) and platinum (WE) to render it conductive. The developed design has been improved through investigation into different factors regarding the immobilisation method of the enzyme in the laminate and the lowering of interferences from oxidising compounds present in sweat. The sensing system exhibits lactate selectivity at physiologically relevant concentrations in sweat for pressure ischemia (0 – 70 mM), with good reproducibility (7. 2 – 12. 2 % RSD) for a hand-manufactured device. The reliability of the sensor’s performance and the capability to detect lactate fluctuations on human sweat samples has been demonstrated. The sensing system showed excellent operational and mechanical stability. The application of Nafion® on the WE lowered interferences from ascorbic acid and uric acid by 96. 7 and 81. 7 % respectively. These results show promise towards the further development of a body-­‐worn monitoring device for determining lactate levels in undiluted human sweat samples in a reproducible, fast and accurate manner...|$|E
40|$|<b>Flexible</b> <b>laminates,</b> {{customized}} {{for specific}} performance parameters, {{are of interest}} to aerospace programs such as lighter-than-air vehicles, balloon systems, decelerator systems, flexible inflatable structures and pressure vessels. The material requirements for these applications include high strength-to-weight ratio and modulus, low gas permeability, pressure retention and the capability to survive in harsh atmospheric, marine and/or stratospheric environments for extended periods of time. Non-woven multidirectional oriented composite laminates using high performance engineering fibers are produced by Cubic Tech to meet these requirements. These <b>flexible</b> <b>laminates</b> achieve a significant weight savings over woven fabrics of similar strengths by eliminating strength and modulus loss and other structural deficiencies caused by crimping of yarns during the weaving process. The absence of crimp in non-woven fabrics results in a linear elastic response that allows for ease in predicting material properties and simplification of structural models. These flexible composites afford the ability to specify structural properties, oriented to meet any design requirement. Parts can be manufactured with complex 2 D and 3 D geometries with integrated structures, load patches and attachment points. Structures fabricated from these laminates can be joined using standard industry seaming techniques to produce seams stronger than the base laminates. Properly designed seams hold structural loads for extended periods without failure, slip or creep...|$|R

40|$|The {{trend in}} {{commercial}} electronics packaging to deliver ever smaller component packaging has enabled {{the development of}} new highly integrated modules meeting the demands of the next generation nano satellites. At under ten kilograms, these nano satellites will require both a greater density electronics and a melding of satellite structure and function. Better techniques must be developed to remove the subsequent heat generated by the active components required to-meet future computing requirements. Integration of commercially available electronics must be achieved without the increased costs normally associated with current generation multi chip modules. In this paper we present a method of component integration that uses silicon heat pipe technology and advanced <b>flexible</b> <b>laminate</b> circuit board technology to achieve thermal control and satellite structure. The' electronics/heat pipe stack then becomes an integral component of the spacecraft structure. Thermal management on satellites has always been a problem. The shrinking size of electronics and voltage requirements and the accompanying reduction in power dissipation has helped the situation somewhat. Nevertheless, the demands for increased onboard processing power have resulted in an ever increasing power density within the satellite body. With the introduction of nano satellites, small satellites under ten kilograms and under 1000 cubic inches, the area available on which to place hot components for proper heat dissipation has dwindled dramatically. The resulting satellite has become nearly a solid mass of electronics with nowhere to dissipate heat to space. The silicon heat pipe is attached to an aluminum frame using a thermally conductive epoxy or solder preform. The frame serves three purposes. First, the aluminum frame provides a heat conduction path {{from the edge of the}} heat pipe to radiators on the surface of the satellite. Secondly, it serves as an attachment point for extended structures attached to the satellite such as solar panels, radiators, antenna and. telescopes (for communications or sensors). Finally, the packages make thermal contact to the surface of the silicon heat pipe through soft thermal pads. Electronic components can be placed on both sides of the flexible circuit interconnect. Silicon heat pipes have a number of advantages over heat pipe constructed from other materials. Silicon heat pipes offer the ability to put the heat pipe structure beneath the active components of a processed silicon wafer. This would be one way of efficiently cooling the heat generated by wafer scale integrated systems. Using this technique, all the functions of a satellite could be reduced to a few silicon wafers. The integration of the heat pipe and the electronics would further reduce the size and weight of the satellite...|$|E
40|$|In the {{following}} thesis, different technologies {{have been investigated}} to implement antenna-in-package solutions at microwave and mm-wave frequencies. This investigation is done by implementing different antenna elements and arrays in each technology, depending on the manufacturing capabilities available in each of them. The technologies investigated are: Flex-Rigid PCB, Ceramic-based PCB, Teflon-based PCB, LTCC and thin-film. Moreover, as a potential application for the antenna-in-package solutions at mm-wave frequencies, a holographic imaging system has been studied. In the 1 st study, a 3 D antenna-in-package solution is implemented in a Flex-rigid PCB technology. The antenna package shows a better-than- 10 -dB return loss at 17. 2 GHz which was the design frequency. Its radiation pattern {{is very similar to}} a simple dipole and makes it very suitable for sensor network nodes. In that case the antenna-in-package solution holds the electronics inside a cubic volume of 1 cm 3 and radiates to the surrounding environment by a dipole-like radiation pattern. This study shows that the proposed Flex-Rigid technology is a promising choice when the antenna-in-package solution needs to cover a geometrical object with sharp edges in a 3 D manner. That is mainly because of a <b>flexible</b> <b>laminate</b> used in the layer build-up of this technology. Moreover, this technology can also be used for the mm-wave applications if a precise sensitivity analysis is done in the design phase. To study the applicability of Ceramic-based PCBs at mm-wave frequencies, a layer build-up incorporating RO 4003 C has been used to implement two antenna-in-package solutions. The 1 st solution incorporates a printed 1 x 2 dipole array. The antenna return-loss and gain bandwidths show promising results for the standard 60 -GHz communication band. Moreover, an aperture patch element has been implemented in the same PCB technology. Although the antenna shows an acceptable return loss, its gain behavior is not flat enough across the whole 60 -GHz band. As RO 4003 C is a well-known material among the microwave engineers, the main goal {{of this study was to}} investigate the characteristics of this laminate at mm-wave frequencies. This study shows that RO 4003 C is an appropriate choice for the antenna-in-package solutions at mm-wave frequencies provided that the manufacturing inaccuracies are taken into account in the design process. Although it possesses the worst electrical performance among the technologies investigated here, it is suitable for mm-wave applications when a very simple layer build-up is needed. As a result of its simple layer build-up, the Ceramic-based technology is the cheapest one among the technologies investigated in this thesis. To achieve the minimum possible loss at mm-wave frequencies, a multi-layer asymmetric Teflon-based PCB technology has been used to implement 2 antenna-in-package solutions. In the 1 st solution a Horn-like element has been designed and investigated in different array configurations. Although the Horn-like element shows a very promising return-loss behavior, its gain and radiation patterns vary drastically with frequency in the 60 -GHz band. However, in terms of interconnect loss and surface-wave excitation it yields very promising characteristics. An end-fire Vivaldi-like antenna element has been designed also in the same technology. The antenna covers the whole 60 -GHz frequency band both in terms of return loss and gain values. Hence, it can be used in the multi-antenna beam-forming applications not only in the 60 -GHz band but also in higher-frequency bands. The main goal of this study was to investigate Teflon-based laminates at mm-wave frequencies. Although the layer build-up is complicated and expensive, it yields the best electrical performance among the other technologies investigated here. However, in terms of packaging performance and reliability, it is the worst technology among the ones investigated in this thesis, especially when several metalized vias are needed in the antenna-in-package solution. In another study, a thin-film technology incorporating high-resistivity Silicon has been used to implement a cavity-backed antenna-in-package solution. Note that the metalized cavities are hardly available in other technologies rather than thin-film technology. Hence, this technology is the best choice to implement cavity-backed antennas. The structure proposed shows the best performance in terms of similarity between the simulation and measurement results because of the very accurate technology used to implement it. Moreover, it covers the whole 60 -GHz standard band both in terms of return-loss and gain bandwidths. Two 1 x 4 arrays were designed and fabricated based on the cavity-backed element. They both show promising results in terms of return loss and pattern shape that makes the antenna element a valuable candidate for 60 -GHz applications. The thin-film technology shows the best manufacturing capability among the technologies investigated here. Moreover, it is a very promising technology for the packaging purposes because it uses the same packaging material, i. e. Silicon, as the one used for the transceiver ICs. Finally, an LTCC technology has been studied for antenna-in-package solutions at mm-wave frequencies. Two antenna elements are implemented in this LTCC technology and their performances were investigated. The 1 st antenna element is a probe-fed patch, fed by a folded SIW feeding network. The antenna element has a wide return-loss bandwidth and its gain bandwidth covers the 60 -GHz standard band. The 2 nd antenna which is a Horn-like element has a wide bandwidth return-loss while its gain behavior is not so wideband. Despite the fact that this Horn-like antenna reduces the surface-wave excitation, its radiation pattern changes so drastically with frequency that makes its applicability limited for the 60 -GHz standard band. This study shows that the LTCC technology delivers the best packaging capabilities for antenna-in-package solutions at mm-wave frequencies. Moreover, compared to the Teflon-based PCB and thin-film technologies which are on the same level of complexity, the LTCC technology is the cheapest one. The unique capability of having stacked vias in LTCC technology makes it the best choice to implement SIW feeding networks as low radiation-loss transmission lines. As an application for the mm-wave/sub-mm-wave systems, a holographic imaging technique has been studied and a spatial-domain image-retrieval technique has been proposed. Compared to the well-known spectral domain technique, this spatial-domain technique reduces the calculation costs especially when the object to be imaged is as big as a human body. Moreover, this technique allows for a cheaper imaging camera because it only needs amplitude measurements while in the spectral-domain technique phase measurements are also needed. status: publishe...|$|E
