25|$|The first dot-matrix {{printers}} {{were invented}} in Japan. In 1968, Japanese manufacturer Epson released the EP-101, the world's first dot-matrix printer. The same year, Japanese manufacturer OKI introduced the first serial impact <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>printer</b> (SIDM), the OKI Wiredot.|$|E
25|$|The {{initializing}} {{codes for}} each model of printer {{had to be}} written into the application. To use a program such as Wordstar with more than one printer (say, a fast <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>printer</b> or a slower but presentation-quality daisy wheel printer), a separate version of Wordstar had to be prepared, and one had to load the Wordstar version that corresponded to the printer selected (and exiting and reloading to change printers).|$|E
5000|$|Often {{considered}} the [...] "backbone" [...] of many industrial and back-office systems, {{there are several}} types of line <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> used today across diverse enterprise production environments including: manufacturing, supply chain, distribution & logistics, transportation, finance and banking. <b>Dot</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>printers,</b> also known also as impact printers, represent the oldest printing technology, are still widely used today, due to its lowest 'cost per page' ratio. <b>Dot</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> are divided on two main groups: serial <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> and line <b>matrix</b> [...] <b>printers.</b>|$|R

2500|$|A <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>printer</b> or impact {{matrix printer}} {{refers to a}} type of {{computer}} printer with a print head that runs {{back and forth on}} the page and prints by impact, striking an ink-soaked cloth ribbon against the paper, much like a typewriter. Unlike a typewriter or daisy wheel printer, letters are drawn out of a dot matrix, and thus, varied fonts and arbitrary graphics can be produced. [...] Because the printing involves mechanical pressure, these printers can create carbon copies and carbonless copies.|$|E
2500|$|Strong Bad Emails (also {{known as}} [...] "sbemails") are {{arguably the most}} popular and {{prolific}} series, featuring Strong Bad answering emails from fans. Since starting in August 2001, the initially brief episodes have grown in length and scope, introducing numerous spin-offs, characters, and inside jokes, such as Homsar, Trogdor, Senor Cardgage, 20X6, the Teen Girl Squad shorts, and Homestar Runner Emails (also known as [...] "hremails"). The format, however, has remained largely unchanged. Each episode typically begins with Strong Bad singing a short song to himself while booting up his computer to check fan emails. Starting a reply, he typically mocks the sender's name, spelling, and grammar, and rarely answers questions directly. While early episodes focused mostly on Strong Bad sitting at the computer with occasional cutaways, over time, the cutaways would become more elaborate, allowing for more complex story lines to develop, growing tangentially from the initial email. Each episode closes with Strong Bad finishing his reply, closing the episode with a link to email Strong Bad appearing via [...] "The Paper", a <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>printer</b> {{at the top of the}} screen. In later episodes, it is replaced with the [...] "New Paper", an inkjet printer, then with the [...] "Compé-per", a pop-up balloon, and finally with a CGI version of the original Paper, which instead promotes Strong Bad's Twitter account. Episodes will often feature extra jokes and sequences as Easter eggs, accessible only by clicking certain objects on the screen during the cartoon.|$|E

50|$|This {{changed to}} some degree with the {{increasing}} popularity of <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>printers.</b> The characters on these systems were drawn {{as a series of}} dots, as defined by a font table inside the printer. As they grew in sophistication, <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>printers</b> started including several built-in fonts from which the user could select, and some models allowed users to upload their own custom glyphs into the printer.|$|R
2500|$|The {{built-in}} display was a one-bit black-and-white, [...] CRT with a fixed {{resolution of}} 512×342 pixels, establishing the desktop publishing standard of 72 PPI. Expansion and networking were achieved using two non-standard RS-422 DE-9 serial ports named [...] "printer" [...] and [...] "modem"; {{they did not}} support hardware handshaking. An external floppy disk drive could be added using a proprietary connector (19-pin D-sub). The keyboard and mouse used simple proprietary protocols, allowing some third-party upgrades. The original keyboard had no arrow keys, numeric keypad or function keys. This was an intentional decision by Apple, as these keys were common on older platforms and {{it was thought that}} the addition of these keys would encourage software developers to simply port their existing applications to the Mac, rather than design new ones around the GUI paradigm. Later, Apple would make a numeric keypad available for the Macintosh 128K. The keyboard sold with the newer Macintosh Plus model would include the numeric keypad and arrow keys, but still no function keys. As with the Apple Lisa before it, the mouse had a single button. Standard headphones could also be connected to a monaural jack. Apple also offered their 300 and 1200bit/s modems originally released for the Apple II line. Initially, the only printer available was the Apple ImageWriter, a <b>dot</b> <b>matrix</b> <b>printer</b> which was designed to produce 144dpi WYSIWYG output from the Mac's 72dpi screen. Eventually, the LaserWriter and other printers were capable of being connected using AppleTalk, Apple's built-in networking system.|$|E
