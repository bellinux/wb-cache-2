60|$|Naturally, at any rate, I didn't stay planted; {{and though}} it seemed long it was {{probably}} for no great time after this that I roamed in my impatience. I was divided between the discourtesy of wishing the ladies would go to bed and the apprehension {{that if they did}} too soon go I might yet lose everything. Was Mrs. Briss waiting for more privacy, or was she only waiting for a complete escape? Of course, even while I asked myself that, I had to remember how much I was taking for granted on her part in the way of conscious motive. Still, if she had not a motive for escaping, why had she not had one, five minutes before, for coming to the point with me? This inquiry kept me hovering where she might at any instant find me, but that was not inconsistent with my presently passing, like herself, into another room. The first one I entered--there were great chains of them at Newmarch--showed me once more, at the end opposite the door, the object that all day had been, present or absent, most in my eyes, and that there now could be no fallacy in my recognising. Mrs. Server's unquenchable little smile had never yet been so far from quenched as when it recognised, on its own side, that I had just had time to note how Ford Obert was, for a change, taking it in. These two friends of mine appeared to have moved together, after the music, to the corner in which I should not have felt it as misrepresenting the matter to say that I surprised them. They owed nothing of the harmony that held them--unlike my other couple--to the constraint of a common seat; a small glazed table, a receptacle for minute objects of price, extended itself between them as if it had offered itself as an occasion for their drawing toward it a pair of low chairs; but their union had nevertheless such an air of accepted duration as led it slightly to puzzle me. This would have been a reason the more for not interrupting it even had I not peculiarly wished to respect it. It was grist to my mill somehow that something or other had happened as a consequence of which Obert had lost the impulse to repeat to me his odd <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> <b>intervene.</b> He gave me no notice as I passed; the notice was all from his companion. It constituted, I felt, on her part, precisely as much and precisely as little of an invitation as it had constituted at the moment--so promptly following our arrival--of my first seeing them linked; which is but another way of saying that nothing in Mrs. Server appeared to acknowledge a lapse. It was nearly midnight, but she was again under arms; everything conceivable--or perhaps rather inconceivable--had passed between us before dinner, but her face was exquisite again in its repudiation of any reference.|$|E
50|$|Tipu Sultan {{decided to}} tighten {{his grip on}} the {{possessions}} in Malabar and to occupy Travancore as he saw the control of ports and access of routes to them highly strategic. The control over Travancore was always been a dream of the Mysore sultans, and Hyder Ali's attempt to defeat Travancore was failed in 1767. The kingdom of Travancore had been a target of Tipu Sultan {{since the end of the}} Second Anglo-Mysore War. Indirect attempts to take over the kingdom had failed in 1788, and Archibald Campbell, the Madras president at the time, had warned Tipu that an attack on Travancore would be treated as a declaration of war on the Company. Tipu Sultan received <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> from some kings of Malabar, especially from the ruler of Cannanore, and soon the Mysore forces were in Malabar. Initially Tipu Sultan tried to induce Travancore tactically with the help of the Kingdom of Cochin, but the King of Cochin refused and allied with Travancore.|$|E
40|$|States under {{international}} law are free to consent {{to a wide range}} of actions which otherwise would constitute breaches of rights owed to them by others. The right of the State to be free from armed intervention is one of the central rights of States in international law. Yet on occasion a State has invited another State or group of States to intervene. The Russian Federation in March 2014 purported to have received an <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> with armed force in Ukraine. Russian intervention set off a train of events leading to the forcible separation of Crimea, which comprises part of the territory of Ukraine, and its annexation to Russia.

Agapetus was elected pope on 10 May 946 after the death Pope Marinus II. The {{existence}} of an independent republic of Rome, ruled by Alberic II, (932-954), son of Marozia and the self-styled [...] "prince and senator of the Romans", meant that Agapetus was prevented from exercising any temporal or secular power in Rome and the Papal States. Tensions between the rival kings of Italy, Berengar II and Otto I allowed Alberic to exercise complete control over Rome and Agapetus, meaning the pope was largely limited to managing internal church affairs. Even Agapetus’ <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> Otto <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> in Italian affairs in 951 was done at the instigation of Alberic, who was growing concerned at Berengar’s growing power. However, when Otto’s envoys, the bishops of Mainz and Chur, were sent to the pope to discuss Otto’s reception in Rome and other more important questions, they were turned away by Alberic.|$|R

40|$|The Intention to Notice: the collection, {{the tour}} and {{ordinary}} landscapes {{is concerned with}} how ordinary landscapes and places are enabled and conserved through making itineraries that are framed around the ephemera encountered by chance, and the practices that make possible the endurance of these material traces. Through observing and then examining the material and temporal aspects {{of a variety of}} sites/places, the museum and the expanded garden are identified as spaces where the expression of contemporary political, ecological and social attitudes to cultural landscapes can be realised through a curatorial approach to design, to effect minimal intervention. Three notions are proposed to encourage investigation into contemporary cultural landscapes: To traverse slowly to allow space for speculations framed by the topographies and artefacts encountered; to [re]make/[re]write cultural landscapes as discursive landscapes that provoke the intention to notice; and to reveal and conserve the fabric of everyday places. A series of walking, recording and making projects undertaken across a variety of cultural landscapes in remote South Australia, Melbourne, Sydney, London, Los Angeles, Chandigarh, Padova and Istanbul, investigate how communities of practice are facilitated through the <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> notice and <b>intervene</b> in ordinary landscapes, informed by the theory and practice of postproduction and the reticent auteur. This community of practice approach draws upon chance encounters and it seeks to encourage creative investigation into places. The Intention to Notice is a practice of facilitating that also leads to recording traces and events; large and small, material and immaterial, that encourages both conjecture and archive. Most importantly, there is an open-ended <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> commit and exchange through design interaction...|$|R
40|$|Joel Wainwright and Geoff Mann’s (2012) {{speculation}} {{on the political}} consequences of climate change—the political consequences of {{the responses to the}} threats of climate change—is an important contribution to the climate debate because it challenges the left to imagine possible political futures different from the ones designed by transnational elites. It is important because it dares to speculate, not for the mere sake of cerebral pleasure but to engage in the politics of climate change on terms other than the ones determined by power. The most important aspect of Wainwright and Mann’s essay is that it immediately poses the question of climate change as a political question: from the beginning it goes beyond identifying the socioecological consequences of climate change (and the techno-regulatory responses to mitigate their effects) and addresses the political perils that might unfold from the responses to climate change if the current hegemonic order and the reactionary forces that challenge it are not defeated. I say defeated because Wainwright and Mann’s essay is also an emphatic <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> <b>intervene</b> in an ongoing war; yet, whether intervening in this war is the only way for the left to transcend the current twin-predicament of climate change and the prospect of planetary capitalist sovereignty—or worse—is not self-evident and remains to be vindicated by the analysis laid ou...|$|E
