25|$|In {{general as}} {{we see in the}} graph below, high <b>gas</b> <b>prices</b> <b>are</b> {{typically}} associated to low storage periods. Usually when prices are high during the early months of the refill season (April–October), many users of storage adopt a wait and see attitude. They limit their gas intake in anticipation that the prices will drop before the heating season begins (November–March). However, when that decrease does not occur, they are forced to buy natural gas at high prices. This is particularly true for Local Distribution and other operators who rely on storage to meet the seasonal demand for their customers. On the other hand, other storage users, who use storage as a marketing tool (hedging or speculating) will hold off storing a lot of gas when the prices are high.|$|E
2500|$|The capital {{expenditure}} {{to build the}} facility mostly depends on the physical characteristics of the reservoir. First of all, the development cost of a storage facility largely depends {{on the type of}} the storage field. As a general rule of thumb, salt caverns are the most expensive to develop on a Bcf of Working Gas Capacity Basis. However one should keep in mind that because the gas in such facilities can be cycled repeatedly, on a Deliverability basis, they may be less costly. A Salt Cavern facility might cost anywhere from $10 million to $25 million/Bcf of working gas capacity. The wide price range is because of region difference which dictates the geological requirements. These factors include the amount of compressive horsepower required, the type of surface {{and the quality of the}} geologic structure to name a few. A depleted reservoir costs between $5 million to $6 million/Bcf of Working Gas Capacity. Finally another major cost incurred when building new storage facilities is that of base gas. [...] The amount of base gas in a reservoir could be as high as 80% for aquifers making them very unattractive to develop when <b>gas</b> <b>prices</b> <b>are</b> high. On the other hand, salt caverns require the least amount of base gas. The high cost of base gas is what drives the expansion of current sites vs the development of new ones. This is because expansions require little addition to base gas.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSince April 1, 2015, {{for those}} non-residential gas users, the stock gas and {{incremental}} <b>gas</b> <b>prices</b> have <b>been</b> unified, and direct-supply <b>gas</b> <b>prices</b> have <b>been</b> released.

50|$|Supply {{and demand}} {{dynamics}} {{in the marketplace}} determine the short term price for natural gas. However, this can work in reverse as well. The price of natural gas can, for certain consumers, affect its demand. This is particularly true for those consumers who {{have the ability to}} switch the fuel which they consume. In general the core customers (residential and commercial) do not have this ability, however, a number of industrial and electric generation consumers have the capacity to switch between fuels. For instance, when natural <b>gas</b> <b>prices</b> <b>are</b> extremely high, electric generators may switch from using natural gas to using cheaper coal or fuel oil. This fuel switching then leads to a decrease for the demand of natural gas, which usually tends to drop its price.|$|E

30|$|Data {{presented}} {{in the first four}} rows of Table  4 show that the pricing strategy under market equilibrium is optimal in terms of the benefits to the electric power company and the natural gas company. If the <b>gas</b> <b>price</b> <b>is</b> high (Scenario 1), power generation by gas turbines and gas purchased from P 2 G facilities drop correspondingly. As a consequence, not only are the benefits to both companies reduced, but the wind curtailment rate and carbon emissions are increased. In contrast, when the <b>gas</b> <b>price</b> <b>is</b> low (Scenario 2), carbon emissions and wind power accommodation are close to those obtained under market equilibrium. The reason is that the low <b>gas</b> <b>price</b> leads to an increase in power generation by gas turbines, displacing coal-fired power generation and reducing carbon emissions. Simultaneously, the natural gas company tends to purchase natural gas from P 2 G facilities, encouraging a better accommodation of wind power. Nevertheless, a low price can reduce revenues of both companies, so such a strategy is not adopted in practice.|$|R
