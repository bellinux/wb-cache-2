This paper describes {{a method that}} reads those paper tapes into files, converts them to graphical representation, modifies and exports them to the required needlework format. The production stages benefit from this, since the produced outcome (graphic design) will be known in real time, enabling the user to perform corrections or alterations, {{with the aid of}} standard graphical tools available in the toolbars of the original design, including creation of new designs. The new or modified designs are saved in the appropriate code format required from each different embroidery machine.

The {{aim of the}} {{research}} work on the 15 th c. chasuble from the parish church of St. Stephen in Motovun was to get a clearer insight into the method of its production, to decide on the method of conservation-restoration interventions, and to confrm the assumption that the chasuble was composed of segments of several items of vestment which used to belong to the parish church inventory. The research work that preceded the conservation-restoration interventions encompassed fabric identification, analyses of all fabrics and ribbons, analysis of stitching, analysis of embroidery, comparison of dimensions of all embroidered segments, and identification of insects. The embroidered crosses were separated {{from the rest of the}} chasuble to allow for a higher quality of conservation, and this also made it possible to analyse the silk velvet, the linen the embroideries were made on, the patterns drawn for the <b>embroideries,</b> the <b>paper</b> and the text, and to identify the ink. This was the frst use in Croatia of the method for testing for the presence of iron ions on paper and textile by test-paper on the basis of 4, 7 -diphenyl- 1, 10 -phenanthroline (C 24 H 16 N 2). The silk velvet was analysed in keeping with the standards recommended by the CIETA association. The working group was composed of conservator-restorers for textile, conservator-restorers for paper, conservator-chemists and conservator-art historians.

De Cordova has had a long association with the RCA’s developments and innovations in this area, and was an original member of the Steering Group and Forum. Participants from a range of backgrounds were invited to speak or present papers on how dyslexia or dyspraxia might have shaped their approaches to problem solving, or influenced their creative practices. This was followed by a panel discussion that focussed on a number of issues, including how a late diagnosis might make sense of long term issues, and how this might be different to those individuals who were aware of their learning difference from childhood. ‘Kicking an Elephant Through a Cat Flap’ was an exhibition of work produced by dyslexic and dyspraxic artists and designers associated with the RCA to coincide with the conference. The two works presented by De Cordova, ‘Sound Track to a Bodied Place’ 2016 (inkjet print) and ‘M’dear Medea’ 2012 (<b>embroidery</b> thread and <b>paper)</b> incorporated homophonic texts (where words sound alike, but have different meanings and spellings) in order to allude to uncertain narratives or interpretations that might arise out of misreading or mishearing...|$|R
40|$|The 1880 s have {{frequently}} {{been described as}} the time during which the Japan mania reached its height in Britain. 1885 was a particularly eventful year. During this year Whistler proclaimed in his Ten O’Clock Lecture that ‘the story of the beautiful is already complete – hewn in the marbles of the Parthenon, and broidered [...] . upon the fan of Hokusai’. The Japanese Village at Knightsbridge opened its gates on 10 January and Gilbert and Sullivan’s The Mikado premiered at the Savoy Theatre on 14 March. Both events received much publicity and generated great interest. The ladies’ newspaper The Queen featured a full-page illustration of the Japanese Village depicting the buildings, people and activities that one was likely to find therein, including embroidery work. An excerpt from the journal describes all the sights to be seen: ‘the most attractive occupation carried on in several of the workrooms is embroidery of large and small pieces of silk satin, and crepe’. A second article singled out embroidery as of primary interest to women, stating that ‘the shop for embroidery is besieged by ladies while that in which the ivory, mother-of-pearl, and wood is carved and the metal chased for inlaying cabinets, &c., is chiefly affected by the men’. Both articles assume a strong and natural feminine interest in Japanese <b>embroidery.</b> This <b>paper</b> examines the exemplary role of Japanese embroidery to women’s art embroidery in late 19 th-century Britain with regard to material, technique and style. Those involved in art and design were turning to Japanese examples for artistic inspiration, and embroidery was no exception. This paper also demonstrates the diverse ways in which women came into contact with Japanese art, such as at Japanese villages, international and national exhibitions, warehouses and department stores and charity bazaars, their own work sometimes being displayed alongside Japanese examples. It is important to emphasise such points of contact because of traditional ideas concerning the Japan mania. The material culture of the Japan mania has been linked with shoddy, mass-produced or amateurish goods employing superfluous ornament rather than the creative production of unique, singular art objects. Traditional art and design history further argues that the wider interest in and consumption of Japanese art wares trickled down from tastemakers such as artists, designers, critics and collectors. Although books such as Mary Eliza Haweis’s Beautiful Houses (1882) offered their readers a glimpse of the Japanese objects employed in household and studio interiors by artists and other celebrities, there were many places where these objects could be experienced more directly, mediated instead by retailers or even peers. While Victorian commentators assumed an affinity between women and Japanese embroiderers in their ‘natural’ capacity for detailed, patient, decorative work, reinforcing particular gender and racial stereotypes, they also expressed unease in the blurring of boundaries relating to race, gender and fine and decorative art in this artistic interaction. This paper will argue that the relationship between women’s art embroidery and Japanese art challenges both Victorian and contemporary perceptions of women’s art needlework in the Japanese style during the Japan mania (1875 - 1900) ...|$|R
40|$|Ode to Colin Wiggins’ 	-A {{project by}} Andrew Kenny in {{collaboration}} with the National Gallery The National Gallery was founded ‘to give the people an ennobling enjoyment’ and this democratic approach to high-art was something I wanted to explore with this project. My original aim was to find out how people today gained this ‘ennobling enjoyment’ and in particular, how it related to my own specialism of Textiles for Fashion. To do this I asked my undergraduate textiles students to visit the gallery and pick out two or three paintings that appealed to them. I then filmed them at the gallery talking about what it was that they liked about them and how they inspired their own practice. I was accompanied on these interviews by Colin Wiggins, Head of Education at the NG and asked him to talk to the student and myself about each painting after the interview. I was stuck not only by Colin’s vast knowledge of the paintings, but also by how he managed to bring each one to life by connecting its story directly to the life in interests of the student. I decided that, as Colin had been such an inspiration, it might be nice to dedicate the project to him and his inspiring narratives of the paintings. To draw from this research I explored the textile medium of patchwork to represent the storytelling that I found so inspiring. My final piece, entitled ‘Ode to Colin Wiggins’ {{takes the form of a}} full-scale embroidered and printed patchwork quilt and brings together many drawings based on the interviews that I conducted. The process used to drawing the picture of Colin (featured centrally on the quilt) connects the embroidery with the paintings and the history of the paintings with their modern narratives. It was created by subverting the use of a CAD embroidery machine by attaching a paintbrush to the head of a CAD embroidery machine. The needle on the machine is prevented from going down and fabric was replaced in the <b>embroidery</b> hoop by <b>paper</b> which was dragged underneath the paintbrush producing strokes and marks which look like stitches. The embroidered and printed patches around his head, and the magazine in his arms visually represent the stories and narratives for the interviews. This work was part of a larger project executed by researchers of London College of Fashion’s Drawing Hub {{in collaboration with}} the National Gallery over the period of a year. The research was presented at a symposium in May 2013 at LCF and the results of this work and shown in an event at the National Gallery on 14 th June 2013. ‘Flight: Drawing Interpretations’ was an exhibition that brought together a group of researchers from London College of Fashion who, over a period of a year, engaged directly with the collection at the National Gallery in London in response to the theme of ‘Flight’. The process of drawing as a means of investigation, of thinking and articulating ideas, played a pivotal role in the development of this research.

U otvorenim pitanjima o restauriranju autentičnih vrijednosti naspram restauriranju značenja, otvorila se i rasprava u kojoj su se sučelile tradicionalna – tzv „klasična“ i suvremene teorije restauriranja. „Klasična teorija restauriranja” oslonjena na objektivnost, istinitost i autentičnost potvrđene znanstvenim istraživanjima i danas je dominantna u konzerviranju-restauriranju, ali se sve više razvijaju i alternativne suvremene teorije koje su nastale na kritici baš tih postavki. In the {{development}} of conservation thought, the theories {{that have been developed}} throughout the 19 th and {{the first half of the}} 20 th century are considered “classic”, as they share an important common principle: it is the em-phasis which is laid on authenticity, i. e. the Truth which is transmitted to the future. The value of each theory is measured by the number of problems it solves. The “classic theory of conservation” is based upon objectivity, truthfulness and authenticity, and is nowadays dominant, with an ever-increasing influence of science in the field. Its conclusions, that conserva-tion must be dominated by the truth, which is further determined and confirmed by scientific methods, are considered to be the cannon. However, a series of younger authors have developed some alternative contemporary theories. Contrary to the “classic”, the “contemporary theory of conservation” does not insist on truthfulness or authenticity of an artefact. It postulates that each conservation effort necessarily alters the artefact, as the conserva-tors change or even impair authenticity. Contemporary theorists argue that conservation modifies the pre-existingauthentic reality of an artefact. Therefore, the process of conservation cannot be objective, as it is the conservators who choose the artefact to be presented in the condition that they are able to give it. A good example for examining the tenets of classic and contemporary theories of conservation, in other words for illustrating the changes taking place in the contemporary theories of conservation, is the chasuble marked as “C 035 from the parish church in Motovun”, which has already been discussed in professional and scientific publications. The conservation treatment was performed in 2009 at the Department for Textiles, Paper and Leather of the Croatian Conservation Institute in Zagreb. The chasuble’s conservation procedure was conducted through exemplary specialist treatments which have already been presented and published. According to the comprehensive documentation of the treatments, it is clear that within the textile layers of the chasuble, there have been detected and identified the traces of lining the Renaissance <b>embroidery</b> with <b>paper,</b> which is a well-known procedure in the technology of embroidery production. In the course of the conservation treatment, the chasuble was physically partitioned, which made it necessary to distinguish two artefacts. One of these was analyzed in detail and valorized; it is the textile portion of the chasuble, which was the primary point of interest and the motive for the strategically planned treatment. The other object was to an extent a complete surprise, although it is not uncommon in conservation practice to encounter similar cases of paper inlays in between the historical layers of textile. It is precisely these paper inlays that have changed their function and “value”, embedded as a different/support material into the textile backing for the embroidery. Here we have two types of material and two semantic levels of identifying-recognizing: a decorative piece of liturgical vestment, designed in a recognizable way from a specific type of textile, which is at the same time adorned with artistically designed embroidery and by way of cutting the written fragments that are shaped to fit the format and the form of the embroidery. These pieces of paper had long ago, when they were inlayed into the chasuble, lost their original material and non-material (communicational) traits and functions, so it is indeed not possible to restore the former unity of the presumed pieces of paper. What has, in terms of the theory of conservation, been achieved by returning the conserved paper inlays into the interior of the chasuble as a conserved liturgical textile artefact? This kind of presentation has, not without dilemmas, been motivated by the ECCO Professional Guidelines. What has been gained is the integrity of the authentic historical layering and the documentary character of the treatment. What has been lost? Most probably the possibility to subsequently analyze and investigate the written fragments, which could lead to a better understanding of the context, in addition to uncovering potential, to us yet unfamiliar values. Was it possible in the first place to rehabilitate the authentic historical function of the <b>paper</b> as the <b>embroidery</b> backing? And can those fragments, due to the damage to the paper, be appropriate for the conserved textile? What about the condition of the 16 th-century paper – can a re-contamination be predicted? What has remained authentic after the conservation and what is an addition? The complex issue of presenting the Motovun chasuble has clearly introduced us to new conservation assignments. The ECCO Professional Guidelines have been selected as starting point for the conservation treatment proposal. With respect to the Guidelines, a question can be raised, of whether the return of the paper fragments to the chasuble has really interfered with its historical value? To put it simply, it is impossible to return to the historical condition prior to the conservation treatment, by re-utilizing the conserved paper fragments and using them as starting point, as the original, authentic condition has indeed been altered. Has the conserved chasuble become redesigned with the use of the existing old elements that have been re-inlayed, but at the same time with the new elements (the thread and other materials used) ...|$|R
