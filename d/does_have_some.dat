5|$|The {{south side}} of the {{mountain}} along Suksdorf Ridge is moderately glacier-free, with the only glaciers being the relatively small Gotchen Glacier and the Crescent Glacier. The south side, however, <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> perennial snowfields on its slopes. The Crescent Glacier is the source of Morrison Creek; and, although it does not feed it directly, the Gotchen Glacier is the source of Gotchen Creek. Both creeks drain to the White Salmon River.|$|E
5|$|Although the Philippines lacks large {{mammalian}} predators, it <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> {{very large}} reptiles such as pythons and cobras, together with gigantic saltwater crocodiles. The largest crocodile in captivity, {{known locally as}} Lolong, was captured in the southern island of Mindanao. The national bird, known as the Philippine eagle has the longest body of any eagle, it generally measures 86 to 102 cm (2.82 to 3.35 ft) in length and weighs 4.7 to 8.0 kg (10.4 to 17.6 lb). The Philippine eagle {{is part of the}} Accipitridae family and is endemic to the rainforests of Luzon, Samar, Leyte and Mindanao.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{bay bolete}} is {{predominantly}} a mycorrhizal species, it <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> saprophytic tendencies {{and may be}} able to use this lifestyle in certain circumstances. The ectomycorrhizae formed between I.badia and spruce (Picea abies) have active hyphal sheaths and a higher potential to store nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, iron, and zinc than other mycorrhizal types, indicating the fungus is well adapted to acidic stands and its mycorrhizae are very efficient in uptake and storage of macronutrients. Mycorrhizae with Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) have also been described.|$|E
5|$|The density {{measured}} by NEAR Shoemaker, 1,300kg/mÂ³, {{is less than}} half that of a typical carbonaceous chondrite; this may indicate that the asteroid is very loosely packed rubble pile. The same is true of several C-type asteroids studied by ground-based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics systems (45 Eugenia, 90 Antiope, 87 Sylvia and 121 Hermione). Up to 50% of the interior volume of Mathilde consists of open space. However, the existence of a 20-km-long scarp may indicate that the asteroid <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> structural strength, so it could contain some large internal components. The low interior density is an inefficient transmitter of impact shock through the asteroid, which also helps to preserve the surface features to a high degree.|$|E
5|$|The {{watershed}} of Keyser Creek was historically {{affected by}} coal mining {{and has been}} channelized. It has no flow in dry conditions, although it <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> during and after storms. As of 1991, the watershed is mostly forested. The first white settlers in Lackawanna County settled near the creek in 1769. Keyser Creek is a major second-order tributary of the Lackawanna River. Since 2013, a trailhead of the Lackawanna River Heritage Trail has been situated near the creek. A number of bridges have also been built across the creek.|$|E

25|$|After {{the early}} studies that {{reported}} that PCE {{children would be}} severely disabled came studies that purported to show that cocaine exposure in utero has no important effects. Almost every prenatal complication originally thought to be due directly to PCE was found to result from confounding factors such as poor maternal nutrition, use of other drugs, depression, and lack of prenatal care. More recently the scientific community has begun to reach an understanding that PCE <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> important effects but {{that they are not}} severe as was predicted in the early studies. The effects of PCE are subtle but they exist. Most people who were exposed to cocaine in utero are normal or close to it.|$|E

Most programs must play at least 35% (by song count) tracks from material added in the last 8 weeks. The station is licensed to the Trustees of the Foothill-De Anza Community College District and operated as a teaching laboratory for the Fine Arts and Communications Department of Foothill College. KFJC, as a community radio station, is almost entirely funded by listener contributions. The cost of running the station, which is staffed entirely by volunteers, is approximately US$100 000 per year. KFJC <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> financial underwriting from local businesses which provides the station.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the process}} of ecdysis is metabolically risky and expensive, it <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> advantages. For one thing it permits a complex {{development}} cycle of metamorphosis in which young animals may be totally different from older phases, such as the nauplius larvae of crustaceans, the nymphs of say, the Odonata, or the larvae of Endopterygota, such as maggots of flies. Such larval stages commonly have ecological and life cycle roles totally {{different from those of}} the mature animals. Secondly, often a major injury in one phase, such as the loss of a leg from an insect nymph, or a claw from a young crab, can be repaired after one or two stages of ecdysis. Similarly, delicate parts that need periodic replacement, such as the outer surfaces of the eye lenses of spiders, or the urticating hairs of caterpillars, can be shed, making way for new structures.|$|E

25|$|At Nikolskoe, {{they also}} meet Katya, Anna Sergevna's sister. Although they remain {{for only a}} short period, both {{characters}} undergo significant change: their relationship with each other is especially affected, as Arkady has begun to find himself and drift from the position of Bazarov's follower. Bazarov in particular finds falling in love distressing because it runs against his nihilist beliefs. Eventually, prompted by Odintsova's own cautious expressions of attraction to him, he announces that he loves her. She does not respond overtly to his declaration, though she too is deeply drawn to Bazarov while finding his dismissal of feelings and the aesthetic side of existence troublesome. While Anna <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> feelings toward Bazarov, they are not akin toward love and Anna cannot open herself to him because she does not see {{the possibility of a}} good future with him. After his avowal of love, and her failure to make a similar declaration, Bazarov proceeds to his parents' home, and Arkady decides to accompany him.|$|E

[...] Dave Kehr, in his review for the Daily News, criticized the film's premise as a [...] "tired idea, and it produces an episodic, unstrung film". The Guardian criticized the film as [...] "a bunch of ideas shoveled into a bag and allowed to spill out at random. The film is infuriating, and will win no prizes.
