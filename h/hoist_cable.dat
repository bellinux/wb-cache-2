Finally, the coal was tipped onto waiting railway wagons below, while the unwanted waste sent to the adjacent heap by an external conveyor.|$|E
2500|$|The wrecker had a Holmes twin-boom {{design with}} a {{swinging}} boom and powered <b>hoist</b> <b>cable</b> on each side.

A power take-off on the transfer case drove a transmission with two winches in the wrecker frame.

The body had low sides on the rear half which tapered to the floor in the front, making clearance for the boom to swing. A brace for the wrecker frame held a spare tire.

5000|$|As cranes {{and their}} control systems became more sophisticated, it became {{possible}} {{to control the}} level of luffing directly, by winching the <b>hoist</b> <b>cable</b> in and out as needed.

50|$|On crane-type draglines, {{the bucket}} {{can also be}} 'thrown' by winding up to the jib and then {{releasing}} a clutch on the drag cable. This would then swing the bucket like a pendulum. Once the bucket had passed the vertical, the <b>hoist</b> <b>cable</b> would be released thus throwing the bucket. On smaller draglines, a skilled operator could make the bucket land about one-half {{the length of the}} jib further away than if it had just been dropped.

50|$|Elevators {{with more}} than 30 m of travel have a system called compensation. This is a {{separate}} set of cables or a chain attached {{to the bottom of}} the counterweight and the bottom of the elevator cab. This makes it easier to control the elevator, as it compensates for the differing weight of cable between the hoist and the cab. If the elevator cab is at the top of the hoist-way, there is a short length of <b>hoist</b> <b>cable</b> above the car and a long length of compensating cable below the car and vice versa for the counterweight. If the compensation system uses cables, there will be an additional sheave in the pit below the elevator, to guide the cables. If the compensation system uses chains, the chain is guided by a bar mounted between the counterweight railway lines.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Traditionally, a {{container}} crane is modeled {{as a simple}} pendulum with either a flexible or a rigid <b>hoisting</b> <b>cable,</b> and a lumped mass {{at the end of}} the cable. However, in the case of quay-side container cranes, the actual configuration of the hoisting mechanism is significantly different it consists typically of a set of four <b>hoisting</b> <b>cables.</b> The <b>cables</b> are <b>hoisted</b> from four different points on a trolley and are attached on the load side to four points on a spreader bar used to lift containers. A controller design based on the actual model will most likely result in a response superior to those based on simple pendulum models. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model of the actual quay-side container crane. A simplified model is then used to obtain the gain and time delay for a delayed feedback controller, which will be used for the control of payload sway oscillation. Performance of the controller is simulated on a 1 / 10 th scale computer model of a 65 ton container crane using the full model. Simulation results are verified experimentally on a 1 / 10 th scale model of the same container crane. Key words: Quay-side, container crane, sway control, delayed feedback 1...|$|R

The crane's hook is kept level by automatically paying out enough extra cable to compensate for this. This is also a purely mechanical linkage, arranged by the reeving of the <b>hoist</b> <b>cables</b> to the jib over a number of pulleys at the crane's apex above the cab, so that luffing the jib upwards allows more free cable and lowers the hook to compensate.|$|R

40|$|During {{the summer}} of 1973 {{we were asked to}} perform a {{theoretical}} investigation of the propagation of low frequency (LF) radio waves down deep (10, 000 feet) hoistshafts* for the case where the <b>hoist</b> <b>cable</b> ("rope") is the only metal conductor present. Propagation is by means of the TEM coaxial mode of transmission in which the <b>hoist</b> <b>cable</b> serves as the inner conductor and the surrounding rock acts as the outer conductor. Since the rock is a relatively poor electrical conductor the current in the outer conductor of the coaxial line is not confined to a very thin surface layer as in a metal coaxial cable, but spreads radially to a distance that is generally many times the shaft diameter. This feature of the wave propagation requires a more sophisticated theoretical treatment than the approximate skin-depth theory that is adequate for metal coaxial lines. In this Part we treat the hoist shaft wave propagation loss, characteristic impedance, and the field current distributions in the surrounding rock medium. We also show that the large penetration of the wave into the rock outer conductor does not present a difficult problem with regard to coupling the transmitter or receiver to the transmission line with a minimum of insertion loss, but that the large impedance mismatch caused by the capacitance termination between the cage and shaft wall may well be the most significant contribution to overall system loss. Inductive coupling and impedance matching to the hoist rope/shaft transmission line are also treated briefly. Preliminary results indicate that a broad minimum in overall system loss should occur between 100 kHz and 1 MHz, possibly centered around 300 kHz. Further work is needed to better quantify this signal loss behavior, compare it with hoist shaft electromagnetic noise spectral data recently acquired by NBS, and identify the most favorable operating frequencies...|$|E
40|$|The {{vibration}} {{and noise}} {{problem has been}} a major challenge in the design and installation of an elevator system. While the transverse vibration of a moving <b>hoist</b> <b>cable</b> has been recently studied, the longitudinal vibration of a moving elevator cable-car system has not been studied. In this work, a new mathematical model for the longitudinal vibration of a moving elevator cable-car system with an arbitrary movement profile is developed. The car is modeled as a mass-spring-damper subsystem attached to {{the lower end of the}} cable. Both the Newtonian method and Hamilton's principle are used to derive the governing equations of the moving cable-car system. The assumed modes method and a new spatial discretization method are used to discretize either the governing partial differential equation of the moving cable or the Lagrangian of the system before the application of Lagrange's equations. The rate of change of the total mechnaical energy is analyzed from the system viewpoint and the control volume viewpoint. An energy flux is defined to describe the rate of energy transfer at the upper boundary of the cable. Numerical simulation of the responses from three spatial discretization schemes are obtained and compared. A definition of the equilibrium position of the system is discussed, and the dynamic responses around the equilibrium position are obtained. The new spatial discretization method can achieve uniform convergence and overcome the drawbacks of the classical assumed modes method...|$|E
