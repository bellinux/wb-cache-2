5|$|Ecotourism setups {{are being}} used to {{generate}} public interest in charismatic animals such as the jaguar, {{while at the same time}} generating revenue that can be used in conservation efforts. Audits done in Africa have shown that ecotourism has helped in African cat conservation. As with large African cats, a key concern in jaguar ecotourism is the considerable habitat space the species requires, so if ecotourism is used to aid in jaguar conservation, some considerations need to be made as to how existing ecosystems will be kept intact, or <b>how</b> <b>new</b> ecosystems that are large enough to support a growing jaguar population will be put into place.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to these materialistic views, Aristotelianism considered all natural things as actualisations of fixed natural possibilities, known as forms. This {{was part of}} a medieval teleological understanding of nature in which all things have an intended role to play in a divine cosmic order. Variations of this idea became the standard understanding of the Middle Ages and were integrated into Christian learning, but Aristotle did not demand that real types of organisms always correspond one-for-one with exact metaphysical forms and specifically gave examples of <b>how</b> <b>new</b> types of living things could come to be.|$|E
5|$|Owing to his keen {{interest}} in the type he followed, with interest, the exploits of Kommando Nowotny, the all jet fighter unit. Although it had low serviceability rates, its aircraft achieved considerable success. To see <b>how</b> <b>new</b> aircraft performed in action, Galland often visited the front line airfields close {{to the scene of}} the fighting. On 8 November 1944, he was present when ace Walter Nowotny took off with a force of Me 262s in an overcast to engage a USAAF raid. Galland listened to it over the radio waves. Nowotny claimed a bomber but his Me 262 was damaged. He was then jumped by USAAF fighters and crashed close to the airfield. Galland heard the firing but did not see the event. It did not dissuade him from believing in the capabilities of the aircraft as a fighter.|$|E

5|$|On the way, {{they start}} the car after Meg puts mousetraps {{for the big}} mouse. Soon they are stopped by the survivors, who were looking for food, but the griffins don't have any food {{so they have to}} {{distract}} them. They continue their journey only to find that the car has run out of gas. The griffins now have to walk to Natick just as they found new home, but Peter thinks that our main journey was Natick as Lois takes an apple and bites it while an old man plays the song. So they once again continue their journey after Lois throws the apple at him. They made to natick, but there is no factory. Stewie yells that they done of their life only to trip and get covered in nuclear waste. Upon the sun lights up and shows the factory is still standing and in perfect condition. Expecting to be able to live off of the snackfood while stewie mutates his arms into tentacles, they establish the town of New Quahog around the factory. Peter proclaims himself mayor, and Joe and Clevemire join him to form a ruling council. One year later, New Quahog has become a fresh new community, complete with houses and wells. Peter has successfully reigned as mayor despite many mistakes, such as giving people jobs picked out of a hat rather than based on the person's skills. However, when Brian points out <b>how</b> <b>New</b> Quahog is a peaceful place with no violence, Peter says that they are completely defenseless finds metal to make guns. Later stewie has transformed into an octopus, when lois tries put stewie on with the pajamas with a trap door on the back, he sprays with ink but misses it. Then he tries to get on the celling only to fall off and lois catch him then says that he getting heavy. Stewie suddenly lays hundreds of eggs. Peter shows and made guns that he uses the pipes from the city's water irrigation system to make guns and other weapons, outraging the citizens.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of reproductive heritability and {{the origin of}} new traits remained a mystery. Towards this end, Darwin developed his provisional theory of pangenesis. In 1865, Gregor Mendel reported that traits were inherited in a predictable manner through the independent assortment and segregation of elements (later known as genes). Mendel's laws of inheritance eventually supplanted most of Darwin's pangenesis theory. August Weismann made the important distinction between germ cells {{that give rise to}} gametes (such as sperm and egg cells) and the somatic cells of the body, demonstrating that heredity passes through the germ line only. Hugo de Vries connected Darwin's pangenesis theory to Weismann's germ/soma cell distinction and proposed that Darwin's pangenes were concentrated in the cell nucleus and when expressed they could move into the cytoplasm to change the cells structure. De Vries {{was also one of the}} researchers who made Mendel's work well-known, believing that Mendelian traits corresponded to the transfer of heritable variations along the germline. To explain <b>how</b> <b>new</b> variants originate, de Vries developed a mutation theory that led to a temporary rift between those who accepted Darwinian evolution and biometricians who allied with de Vries. In the 1930s, pioneers in the field of population genetics, such as Ronald Fisher, Sewall Wright and J. B. S. Haldane set the foundations of evolution onto a robust statistical philosophy. The false contradiction between Darwin's theory, genetic mutations, and Mendelian inheritance was thus reconciled.|$|E

25|$|The missing {{information}} needed to help explain <b>how</b> <b>new</b> features could pass from a parent to its offspring {{was provided by the}} pioneering genetics work of Gregor Mendel. Mendel’s experiments with several generations of pea plants demonstrated that inheritance works by separating and reshuffling hereditary information during the formation of sex cells and recombining that information during fertilisation. This is like mixing different hands of playing cards, with an organism getting a random mix of half of the cards from one parent, and half of the cards from the other. Mendel called the information factors; however, they later became known as genes. Genes are the basic units of heredity in living organisms. They contain the information that directs the physical development and behavior of organisms.|$|E
25|$|The {{outbreak}} of revolution in France {{in the summer}} of 1789 had a powerful effect on the colony. While the French settlers debated <b>how</b> <b>new</b> revolutionary laws would apply to Saint-Domingue, outright civil war broke out in 1790 when the free men of color claimed they too were French citizens {{under the terms of the}} Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. Ten days before the fall of the Bastille, in July 1789, the French National Assembly had voted to seat six delegates from Saint-Domingue. In Paris, a group of wealthy mulattoes, led by Julien Raimond and Vincent Ogé, unsuccessfully petitioned the white planter delegates to support mulatto claims for full civil and political rights. Through the efforts of a group called Société d'Amis des Noirs, of which Raimond and Ogé were prominent leaders, in March 1790 the National Assembly granted full civic rights to the gens de couleur.|$|E

25|$|Informality of {{land tenure}} {{is a key}} {{characteristic}} of urban slums. At their start, slums are typically located in least desirable lands near the town or city, that are state owned or philanthropic trust owned or religious entity owned or have no clear land title. Some immigrants regard unoccupied land as land without owners and therefore occupy it. In some cases the local community or the government allots lands to people, which will later develop into slums and over which the dwellers don't have property rights. Informal land tenure also includes occupation of land belonging to someone else. According to Flood, 51 percent of slums are based on invasion to private land in sub-Saharan Africa, 39 percent in North Africa and West Asia, 10 percent in South Asia, 40 percent in East Asia, and 40 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean. In some cases, once the slum has many residents, the early residents form a social group, an informal association or a gang that controls newcomers, charges a fee {{for the right to}} live in the slums, and dictates where and <b>how</b> <b>new</b> homes get built within the slum. The newcomers, having paid for the right, feel they have commercial right to the home in that slum. The slum dwellings, built earlier or in later period as the slum grows, are constructed without checking land ownership rights or building codes, are not registered with the city, and often not recognized by the city or state governments.|$|E
