40|$|Background: Fishermen {{working on}} deep-sea {{vessels in the}} Barents and Norwegian Sea are exposed to low air temperatures, strong winds, high humidity, rain, snow and work at {{different}} intensities. Few studies have investigated the effect of environmental work factors on the physiology of this occupational group. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate work strain and thermophysiological responses of fishermen on the trawl and factory decks of deep-sea vessels. Materials and methods: Twenty-five professional male fishermen (age 39 ± 13 years) were recruited to the study which was performed on three trawlers in the Norwegian Sea in April, June and August 2014. During a six-hour shift, heart rate (HR), core (Tc) and mean skin (Ts) temperatures were recorded, and questions about subjective thermal sensation and comfort were answered. Results: Short periods of hard (above 86 % of HRmax) work raised Tc by 0. 8 °C to 37. 8 °C and decreased Ts by 2. 3 °C to 29. 8 °C during work on the trawl deck, and subjects reported being warm and sweaty. On the factory <b>deck</b> long <b>periods</b> of fairly light (between 52 % and 66 % HRmax) work, Tc of 37. 4 °C and Ts of 30. 9 °C were measured. Conclusions: Fishermen experience intermittent periods of heavy work on the trawl deck shown with elevated core temperature and HR. Work on the factory <b>deck</b> includes long <b>periods</b> of repetitive work with light to moderate work strain.

5000|$|The first {{indigenous}} Japanese deck was the Tenshō karuta {{named after}} the Tenshō period (1573-92). It was a 48 card deck with the 10s missing like Portuguese <b>decks</b> from that <b>period.</b> It kept the four Latin suits of cups, coins, clubs, and swords along with the three face cards of female knave, knight, and king. In 1633, the Tokugawa shogunate banned these cards, forcing Japanese manufacturers to radically redesign their cards. As a result of Japan's isolationist Sakoku policy, karuta would develop separately {{from the rest of}} the world. In order to hide the proscription of Portuguese derived cards, makers turned the cards into very abstract designs known as mekuri karuta. By the mid-20th century, all mekuri karuta fell into oblivion with the exception of Komatsufuda (Japanese: [...] ) which is used to play Kakkuri, a matching game found in Yafune, Fukui prefecture.|$|R

No studies have investigated the effect of environmental work factors on selected physiological parameters of fishermen on board Norwegian deep-sea trawlers. This study was therefore performed to increase knowledge about work strain and environmental challenges on factory and trawl deck, by recording heart rate (HR), core (Tc) and mean skin (Ts) temperatures of 25 fishermen during work on deep-sea trawlers. Short periods of hard (above 86 % of HRmax) work, increased Tc by 0. 8 °C to 37. 8 °C and decreased Ts by 2. 3 °C to 29. 8 °C were measured on trawl deck, together with subjective reports of being warm and sweaty. On factory <b>deck</b> long <b>periods</b> of fairly light (between 52 - 66 % HRmax) work, Tc of 37. 4 °C and Ts of 30. 9 °C were measured. Fishermen endures short periods of intermittent work with heavy work strain on trawl <b>deck</b> and long <b>periods</b> of repetitive work with light to moderate work strain on factory deck. The present study characterizes work strain and environmental challenges endured by fishermen, and can help identify risk exposures during work in cold and warm environments. Based on observations and measurements from the field study a laboratory {{study was conducted with}} the objective of studying the relationship between high (85 %) and low (19 %) relative humidity (RH) and sweat rate during inactive recovery after high intensity work in a warm environment (30 °C). Ten male subjects volunteered to perform two 20 -minute run-trials at 68 ± 4 % of maximal oxygen consumption followed by 36 minutes of upright inactive recovery. Regional sweat rate (RSR) was measured on the arm and back by technical absorbent pads at regular intervals and gross sweat loss was estimated from change in body weight. Tc, Ts, and HR were measured continuously during running and recovery. RSR were significantly (p< 0. 05) higher in high humidity, compared to low humidity conditions for both arm and back during running and inactive recovery. The highest sweat rates were observed on the back during the test in high humidity test with mean values of 1387 g m- 2 h- 1 during the last five minutes of running and 1379 g m- 2 h- 1 during the first five minutes of recovery. RSR showed weak to moderate correlations to local skin temperature during inactive recovery, but no correlations to local skin temperature during running. Tc continued to increase for three and seven minutes post-exercise in 19 % RH and 85 % RH respectively. HR was 11 bpm higher after running in 85 % RH compared to 19 % RH (p= 0. 001). Thermal load was higher during post-exercise recovery in high compared to low humidity conditions...|$|R

It includes artefacts including original blueprints of the ship, the lifejacket of John Jacob Astor (which he gave to his wife when they parted aboard Titanic), and original wireless messages. In Branson, Missouri a Titanic Museum is located inside a half-size replica of the ship, complete with iceberg. It presents replicas of the ship's lobby, cabins and wireless rooms and various items of memorabilia and artefacts. The same company operates the Titanic Museum in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, which recreates the ship's Grand Staircase as well as enabling visitors to experience the cold of the ocean and the heat of the boiler rooms. Titanic The Experience—in Orlando, Florida—likewise recreates the Grand Staircase, the Verandah Café, a first-class suite and part of the Promenade <b>Deck.</b> Actors in <b>period</b> dress provide guided tours to visitors. RMS Titanic Inc., which is authorised to salvage the wreck site, has a permanent Titanic exhibition at the Luxor Las Vegas hotel and casino in Nevada which features a 22-ton slab of the ship's hull.

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore {{structural}} engineeringThis report {{deals with}} how the design principles of different drilling vessels affect the motion characteristics and operability. Furthermore, the vertical heave limitation’s influence on the operability has been analyzed. Drill strings and risers permit only minimal vertical relative motions between the vessel and the seabed. Seakeeping and wave load analyses are therefore very important in operability studies. The motion behavior of the three analyzed vessel concepts can, due to the hull design, be described by very different characteristics. This manifests itself {{both in terms of}} natural <b>periods,</b> <b>deck</b> load capacities, waterline areas and dynamic amplification magnitudes. In addition, transit speed, price and build complexity are greatly affected by the design philosophy. The operability of the vessels has been calculated for the “Southern Green Canyon” field in the Gulf of Mexico, the “Ormen Lange” field in the North Sea and for conditions typical for the west coast of Africa. The analyses show that all three vessels achieve a high operability in the Gulf of Mexico and west coast of Africa. In North Sea conditions, the SEVAN unit shows an unsatisfactory vertical response in the winter season, with a low operability as consequence. The operability in the mentioned areas can be seen in Table 1. Table 1 : Operability in three potential areas of operation. The operability can however be somewhat deceptive regarding indication of general motion behavior. In the most frequently encountered sea states the SEVAN unit performs better than the West Navigator in spite of lower operability. Furthermore, the West Navigator has in average twice the heave amplitudes compared to the Aker H 6 under normal operational conditions...|$|R

40|$|Composite one-way {{concrete}} floor slabs with profiled steel decking as permanent formwork {{are commonly used}} in the construction industry. Despite their common usage, relatively {{little research has been}} undertaken on the in-service behaviour of such slabs and little guidance is available to practising engineers. Most previous experimental studies of composite slabs incorporating steel decking have involved short-term load tests that have concentrated on the strength, ductility and failure mode of the slabs. Long-term testing to study the time-dependent service load behaviour and in particular, the effects of creep and shrinkage of the concrete in this increasingly popular form of construction have been largely neglected. There exists an urgent need for research on the serviceability of composite slabs, as excessive deflection is often the critical design consideration, especially in long-span slabs. The situation has been exacerbated in recent years with the advent of high strength materials (both concrete and steel) without significantly higher stiffness, {{and the development of a}} wide range of new and innovative decking profiles. Serviceability rather than strength is often the governing limit state in the design of concrete elements, particularly in shallow deflection-sensitive elements such as floor slabs. The research in this thesis is the first detailed study of the effects of creep and shrinkage on the in-service behaviour of composite slabs. Laboratory experiments have been conducted on composite slabs to measure: the distribution of shrinkage strain through the thickness of the slabs; shrinkage-induced deflections in the slabs and time-dependent deflections and cracking under sustained loads. Analytical models have been developed and calibrated to predict these effects and reliable design guidance has been presented for the construction industry and practising design engineers. The change in the bond-slip relationship between profiled steel decking and concrete slab with time due to creep and shrinkage was not identified previously. The time-dependent effects of creep and shrinkage on the bond-slip characteristics for slabs with profiled <b>decking</b> during extended <b>periods</b> under sustained service loads have also been investigated...|$|R
