5|$|Honeyeaters {{prefer to}} forage at {{individual}} flowers which have only just opened, as these {{offer the most}} nectar. As they probe for nectar, honeyeaters <b>end</b> <b>up</b> with large quantities of pollen on their beaks, foreheads and throats, some of which they subsequently transfer to other flowers.
