40|$|ABSTRACT Studies were {{conducted}} to establish normal <b>ionized</b> calcium levels and the relation-ship of <b>ionized</b> calcium to total blood calcium concentrations during various physiological states in the turkey. <b>Ionized</b> calcium levels were similar in fresh plasma and serum. <b>Ionized</b> calcium in plasma was significantly lower after 8 hr of storage at 4 C compared to fresh plasma. After only 4 hr of storage <b>ionized</b> calcium levels were significantly depressed in serum.

40|$|Foscarnet (trisodium {{phosphonoformate}} hexahydrate) is an antiviral agent used {{to treat}} cytomegalovirus disease in immunocompromised patients. One common side effect is acute <b>ionized</b> hypocalcemia and hypomagnesemia following intravenous administration. Foscarnet-induced <b>ionized</b> hypomagnesemia might contribute to <b>ionized</b> hypocalcemia by impairing excretion of preformed parathyroid hormone (PTH) or by producing target organ resistance. Prevention of <b>ionized</b> hypomagnesemia following foscarnet administration could blunt the development of <b>ionized</b> hypocalcemia. To determine whether intravenous magnesium ameliorates the decline in <b>ionized</b> calcium and/or magnesium following foscarnet infusions, MgSO 4 at doses of 1, 2, and 3 g was administered in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover trial to 12 patients with AIDS and cytomegalovirus disease.

Supplementation, however, had no discernible effect on foscarnet-induced <b>ionized</b> hypocalcemia despite significant increases in serum PTH levels. No dose-related, clinically significant adverse events were found, suggesting that intravenous supplementation with up to 3 g of MgSO 4 was safe in this chronically ill population.

40|$|Hypocalcemia is {{a common}} problem in {{critically}} ill surgical patients. We prospectively evaluated whether measurement of the total serum calcium (Ca) concentration or calculation of the serum <b>ionized</b> Ca level (by the McLean-Hastings nomogram) accurately reflects the measured serum <b>ionized</b> Ca level. Although 71 % and 58 % of 156 predominantly surgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients were hypocalcemic by the total serum Ca or calculated <b>ionized</b> Ca level, respectively, only 12 % were hypocalcemic by directly measured serum <b>ionized</b> Ca measurement. The total serum Ca and calculated <b>ionized</b> Ca concentrations were sensitive (95 % and 89 %, respectively) but lacked specificity (32 % and 46 %, respectively) in predicting <b>ionized</b> hypocalcemia. Analyses of Ca binding to albumin in the serum of surgical ICU patients and normal subjects suggested {{that there is a}} circulating factor in critically ill patients that increases the binding of Ca to albumin. These observations may explain why the McLean-Hastings nomogram underestimates the protein-induced changes in serum Ca in critically ill surgical subjects. We conclude that: total serum Ca and calculated <b>ionized</b> Ca concentrations are poor indicators of the true serum <b>ionized</b> Ca status in critically ill surgical patients, and we recommend direct measurement of serum <b>ionized</b> Ca levels in these patients; and variability in the affinity of Ca for binding proteins in critical illness may explain the poor correlation between serum total and <b>ionized</b> Ca measurements...|$|R

In kidney disease the relationship between <b>ionized</b> and total circulating magnesium is often altered.

Method: We prospectively measured <b>ionized</b> magnesium concentrations in 299 subjects (113 control subjects and 186 patients undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease). Subjects were categorized by age. In the surgical group blood samples were obtained before bypass, during bypass (cooling and rewarming), after bypass, and during admission to the intensive care unit. <b>Ionized</b> hypomagnesemia was defined as <b>ionized</b> magnesium level 2 standard deviations below the mean of control subjects in the same age group. Patients were analyzed, controlling for cardiopulmonary bypass time. Results: In the control group <b>ionized</b> magnesium concentrations differed by age. Neonates and adults showed lower <b>ionized</b> magnesium concentrations {{compared with those of}} other age groups. Infants exhibited the highest <b>ionized</b> magnesium concentration. In the surgical group patients older than 1 month showed a higher proportion of <b>ionized</b> hypomagnesemia compared with that found in neonates at baseline (P <. 001), after bypass (P =. 03), and at admission to the intensive care unit (P =. 02). Controlling for cardiopulmonary bypass time, patients older than 1 month who were hypomagnesemic during bypass showed longer intubation time (P =. 001) and longer intensive care stay (P =. 01) and tended to have a higher pediatric severity of illness score on intensive care admission (P =. 14) compared with patients without <b>ionized</b> hypomagnesemia. Conclusions: There are age-related differences in normal <b>ionized</b> magnesium concentrations. <b>Ionized</b> hypomagnesemia is a common and clinically relevant occurrence among patients older than 1 month of age undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease.
