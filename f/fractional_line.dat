40|$|Signal space {{models in}} both phase-encode, and frequency-encode {{directions}} are presented for extrapolation of 2 D partial kspace. Using the boxcar representation of low-resolution spatial data, and a geometrical representation of signal space vectors in {{both positive and}} negative phase-encode directions, a robust predictor is constructed using a series of signal space projections. Compared to some of the existing phase-correction methods that require acquisition of a pre-determined set of <b>fractional</b> kspace <b>lines,</b> the proposed predictor is found to be more efficient, due to its capability of exhibiting an equivalent degree of performance using only half the number of <b>fractional</b> <b>lines.</b> Robust filtering of noisy data is achieved using a second signal space model in the frequency-encode direction, bypassing the requirement of a prior highpass filtering operation. The signal space is constructed from Fourier Transformed samples of each row in the low-resolution image. A set of FIR filters are estimated by fitting a least squares model to this signal space. Partial kspace extrapolation using the FIR filters is shown to result in artifact-free reconstruction, particularly in respect of Gibbs ringing and streaking type artifacts...|$|R

We review how in general they are `fractional' line bundles, not honest line bundles, twisted on triple overlaps. We discuss the special case of moduli spaces of {{elliptic}} curves in detail. There, the Bagger-Witten line bundle does not exist as an ordinary line bundle, but rather is necessarily fractional. As a <b>fractional</b> <b>line</b> bundle, it is nontrivial (though torsion) over the uncompactified moduli stack, and its restriction to the interior, excising corners with enhanced stabilizers, is also fractional. It becomes an honest line bundle on a moduli stack defined by a quotient of the upper half plane by a metaplectic group, rather than SL(2,Z). We review and compare to results of recent work arguing that well-definedness of the worldsheet metric implies that the Bagger-Witten line bundle admits a flat connection (which includes torsion bundles as special cases), and give general arguments {{on the existence of}} universal structures on moduli spaces of SCFTs, in which superconformal deformation parameters are promoted to nondynamical fields ranging over the SCFT moduli space.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{resolved}} neutral hydrogen emission properties {{of a sample}} of eleven of the nearest spiral galaxies. Between 60 and 90 % of the total H I line flux within the optical disk {{is due to a}} high brightness network (HBN) of emission features which are marginally resolved in their narrow dimension at about 150 pc and have a face-on covering factor of about 15 %. Averaged line profiles of this component are systematically non-Gaussian with a narrow core (less than about 6 km s − 1 FWHM) superposed on broad Lorentzian wings (30 km s − 1 FWHM). An upper limit to the gas temperature of 300 K follows directly from the narrow line profiles, while simple modeling suggests kinetic temperatures equal to the peak emission brightness temperature (80 – 200 K) in all cases but the outer disks of low mass galaxies, where the HBN becomes optically thin to the λ 21 cm line.

The non-convexity that has been observed in the Transmission Network Planning cannot be solved effectively by conventional mathematical methods. GA {{has the ability to}} find the global optimal point in such a nonconvex function. It is recognized that the allocation of transmission costs in a competitive environment requires careful evaluation of alternative transmission network plans. As a result, the need for methods that are able to synthesize optimal transmission network plans has become more important than ever. Unfortunately, practice has shown that conventional optimization procedures are unable to produce optimal solutions for networks. The reason is that the transmission network planning problem is hard, large-scale combinatorial problem. The number of options to be analyzed increases exponentially with the size of the network. The objective of TNP is to determine the installation plans of new facilities (lines & other network equipment) so that the resulting bulk power system may be able, to meet the forecasted demand at the lowest cost, while satisfying prescribed technical, financial and reliability criteria. Although the conventional methods are somewhat successful in transmission network planning, some problems still exist: 1) Non-convexity (as described above) : Therefore, the optimization process sometimes stops at non-optimal solutions. 2) Non-linearity: increases the iterations of the optimization algorithm and sometimes causes divergence. As there are no <b>fractional</b> transmission <b>lines,</b> transmission network planning becomes a very complex mixed integer non-linear programming problem.

Based on Al-in-hornblende barometry, the batholith records intrusion pressures from ~ 0. 2  GPa in the north (where the volcano-sedimentary cover is intruded) to max. ~ 0. 9  GPa in the southeast. The Al-in-hornblende barometry demonstrates that the Kohistan batholith represents a complete cross section across an arc batholith, reaching from the top at ~ 8 – 9  km depth (north) to its bottom at 25 – 35  km (south-central to southeast). Despite the complete outcropping and accessibility of the entire batholith, there is no observable compositional stratification across the batholith. The geochemical characteristics of the granitoids define three groups. Group 1 is characterized by strongly enriched incompatible elements and unfractionated middle rare earth elements (MREE) /heavy rare earth element patterns (HREE); Group 2 has enriched incompatible element concentrations similar to Group 1 but strongly fractionated MREE/HREE. Group 3 is characterized by only a limited incompatible element enrichment and unfractionated MREE/HREE. The origin of the different groups can be modeled through a relatively hydrous (Group 1 and 2) and of a less hydrous (Group 3) <b>fractional</b> crystallization <b>line</b> from a primitive basaltic parent at different pressures.

Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared with tight ligation of the spinal nerves for producing allodynia and with a lumbar intrathecal catheter for drug administration. Allodynia thresholds for hindpaw withdrawal against mechanical stimuli were assessed and converted to percent maximal possible effect.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of BM-MSCs or iPSC-MSCs on CS-induced changes in serum and cardiac lipid profiles, oxidative stress and inflammation as well as cardiac function in a rat model of passive smoking. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly selected for exposure to either sham air (SA) as control or 4 % CS for 1 h per day for 56 days. On day 29 and 43, human adult BM-MSCs, iPSC-MSCs or PBS were administered intravenously to CS-exposed rats.

40|$|Although many {{components}} of the insulin-signaling pathway are present in pancreatic β-cells, the exact role of insulin feedback on β-cell function remains controversial. In a previously characterized Insulin Receptor Substrate 1 (IRS- 1) overexpressing β-cell <b>line,</b> <b>fractional</b> insulin secretion and cytosolic calcium levels were increased compared to wild type and vector controls. This effect of IRS- 1 may be mediated by inhibition of the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA). In this work, we investigate the potential mechanisms by which IRS- 1 inhibits SERCA function. Our hypothesis is that IRS- 1 interacts directly with SERCA to modulate calcium homeostasis and insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells. Overexpression of IRS- 1 resulted in a decrease in SERCA 3 gene expression compared to wild-type cells. Calcium uptake in ER-enriched fractions prepared from wild-type and IRS- 1 overexpressing cell lines however, shows no significant difference, indicating that neither a reduction of SERCA 3 b expression nor the expression of defective SERCA protein can account for the previously observed decrease in calcium uptake by IRS- 1 overexpressing cells. Treatment of wild-type β-cells with thapsigargin (Tg), an inhibitor of SERCA that binds directly to the protein, resulted {{in an increase in}} cytosolic calcium and glucose-stimulated fractional insulin secretion similar to that observed in IRS- 1 overexpressing cells. Given the apparent similarity in inhibition mechanism, IRS- 1 most likely acts by directly binding to SERCA. To further illustrate the probability of IRS- 1 /SERCA interaction, we demonstrate using subcellular fractionation, immunofluorescence, and immuno-electron microscopy that IRS proteins localize to endoplasmic reticulum derived intracellular membranes where SERCA is also present, increasing the likelihood that these proteins can interact with one another. In CHO-T cells transiently transfected with SERCA 3 b alone or together with IRS- 1, SERCA 3 b co-immunoprecipitates with IRS- 1. This interaction is enhanced with insulin treatment. SERCA 3 b also co-immunoprecipitates with IRS- 1 in wild type and IRS- 1 overexpressing β-cell lines. Co-immunoprecipitation of IRS- 1 and SERCA in CHO-T cells and β-cells confirms that these proteins do indeed interact directly. Taken together, our data indicate the existence of a novel positive feedback loop of insulin on insulin secretion in β-cells that appears to be mediated by a direct interaction between IRS proteins and SERCA. ...|$|R
40|$|Preface The {{wide area}} of Microwave Systems is a rapidly-growing one, it is {{therefore}} rapidly becoming a very extended and complex sector of human scientific and technical knowledge. The idea {{to write a book}} on Advanced Microwave Systems has been therefore a very challenging one for me and the people who helped me in the effort for building the book itself. The first thing I thought was that we could treat only a few arguments with good deepness, therefore I reduced my attention to some advanced sectors of the subject. The Reader will find in this book four Parts: one devoted to transmission lines and periodic structures, the second one to filters, the third to the more and more important area of microsystems, the last one is devoted to antennas. The first Part on transmission lines and periodic structures begins with a Chapter on Electromagnetic Band-Gap (EBG) waveguide structures, that presents a rigorous semi-analytical approach for analyzing vertical full-height posts in a rectangular waveguide. When the posts are stacked along the waveguide, the reflection and transmission matrices are concatenated over the entire system using the recurrence relations. This leads to the generalized reflection and transmission matrices characterizing the frequency response of an EBG formed by an array of circular posts in the rectangular waveguide. Numerical examples for the frequency responses of a pair of two identical dielectric posts and their 9 -stacked structure are presented for the excitation by the fundamental TE 10 mode. In the second Chapter <b>fractional</b> transmission <b>lines</b> and waveguides are treated. Fractional curl operator is an intermediate step operator between the vector identity operator and the ordinary curl operator used in vector calculus. It yields solutions which are intermediate between the original solution of the Maxwell equations and the solution dual to the original one. Using fractional curl operator, the <b>fractional</b> dual transmission <b>lines</b> and <b>fractional</b> dual waveguides are discussed. Behaviors of field lines and impedances of the fractional dual guides are discussed. Then two-dimensional metallic periodic structures are studied. In this third Chapter, the rigorous mode-matching method incorporating Floquet-Bloch theory was employed to systematically investigate eigen-waves propagating in a two-dimensional periodic medium made up of a metallic cylinders array arranged in a square lattice. The dispersion characteristics and phase relation of the eigen-waves are demonstrated to explain the physical insight of wave process involved in 2 D metallic periodic structures. Significantly, the extraordinary refraction occurring at the interface between the two-dimensional metallic periodic structures (or wired-based metamaterial) and a dielectric medium was confirmed by the Snell’s law and phase-relation diagram developed in this work. The following work is on three-dimensional EBG structures. In this fourth Chapter, a Fourier Modal Method (FMM) for accurate and efficient characterization of three-dimensional Electromagnetic Band-Gap materials is presented. The EBG has a finite thickness and it is considered as a superposition of doubly-periodic gratings, infinitely extending only in two dimensions. The potentiality of the approach in the analysis of electromagnetic crystals is discussed. Some applications are presented: an EBG with a complete 3 D band-gap; a spatial, frequency and polarization filtering cavity; a woodpile superstrate to be employed for directivity-enhancing of planar antennas. The last contribution of the first Part (fifth Chapter) is devoted to three-dimensional gratings. A novel numerical method in the frequency domain is presented for analyzing three-dimensional gratings using a model of doubly-periodic magneto-dielectric layer. The method is based on the three-dimensional volume integral equations for the equivalent electric and magnetic polarization currents of the assumed periodic medium. The arbitrary profiles of three-dimensional dielectric or metallic gratings can be flexibly modeled by adjusting the material parameters and sizes or locations of the parallelepiped segments in the unit cell. The numerical examples for various grating geometries and their comparisons with those presented in the literature demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method. The second Part of the book is completely devoted to RF waveguide filters. This Part, which may be a volume in itself, was built in extended form in order to write a very useful design path for the Engineer who needs to design and realize a key component as an RF filter. It is due to the wide experience of the filters group of a major European research center (ESA-ESTEC). The Chapter provides guidelines on the design process of RF waveguide bandpass filters. As an example, the design of a simple filter is used to illustrate the process in detail starting from the technical specifications to the measurement results. In particular, attention is given to the steps that are critical in the design process of filters used for space applications when the environmental and RF power constraints become design drivers. The steps in the process are described, and the necessary formulas and calculations are given using the data for the example filter. In the third Part the arguments treated belong to the area of materials and Microsystems. The aim of the first Chapter is to overview the technology, modeling and measurement techniques devoted to RF Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) and related architectures based on micro-switches. In particular, the main aspects in optimizing the manufacturing yield are stressed, together with the modeling issues. Experimental results obtained for a binary distributed phase shifter based on RF MEMS coplanar shunt switches are also presented. The scope of the second Chapter is to outline the Compound Semiconductor (CS) Microwave Monolithic Integrated Circuit (MMIC) technology, by systematically reviewing state of the art devices, fabrication technologies, circuits design methods and their related performances, in view for their application in advanced microwave systems. For this purpose, the specific advantages and limitations of each technological approach, also compared to alternative solutions based on vacuum tubes or other solid state devices, is outlined. The third and fourth Chapters are dedicated to SiGe components, by stressing technologies and design techniques, respectively. The dynamism of modern life mandates support tools and electronic equipments, more and more powerful, handy and aligned with changing needs. The engine of this challenge is a wide set of technologies whose success is based on the optimum trade-off among performance, level of integration, and cost. While compound semiconductors are generally exploited for very high performance applications, their inherent high production cost and low compatibility with high integration levels for base-band functional blocks limit the adoption to niche markets. Recently, SiGe HBT technologies have demonstrated competitive performance with respect to compound semiconductors. Moreover, they entail much lower production costs and guarantee full compatibility with CMOS devices (BiCMOS processes). Therefore, SiGe technologies can be considered a powerful alternative to compound semiconductors. The fifth and conclusive Chapter of the third Part is on the use of diamond in electronic devices. Diamond is an astonishing material. Used mainly for jewelry, it is today studied for electronic devices to be operated in harsh environment or as the base material for high power, high frequency applications due to the unique electrical, physical, chemical and mechanical properties. Diamond can be classified as a wide band gap semiconductor, its suitability for performance in the microwave range is today demonstrated through an affordable deposition technology and rather simple device structures. The fourth and last Part is devoted to some advanced antenna systems. The first Chapter focuses on the general properties of planar periodic leaky-wave antennas, and presents an accurate and versatile method for analyzing this class of structures using the method of moments together with a mixed-potential form of the electric field integral equation. This type of antenna structure consists of a planar periodic metallization on a grounded substrate, and is thus low in profile and simple to fabricate. Depending on the frequency, radiation may occur in either the backward or the forward directions. In the second Chapter design strategies are reviewed and presented for harmonic-tuned active integrated antennas based on the use of microstrip patches and compact photonic bandgap filters. The synthesis of optimal values for the antenna input impedance at the fundamental, second, and third harmonic frequencies can be achieved by perturbing either the geometry of the antenna or the geometry of the filter. Numerical simulations of input impedance and radiation properties are provided on specific examples of antennas to validate the proposed approaches. The third Chapter describes frequency-scanning leaky-wave antennas based on stub-loaded ridge-rectangular waveguides. First of all, the modified mode-matching method is introduced to accurately analyze such a guide because it includes many conductor edges at which the fields diverge. Then leakage properties of the guide to design an antenna are given in the form of parametrical studies. Next, an example of a designed antenna is shown numerically and experimentally. Finally, the problems on the excitation by the coax feed, arraying the antenna and so on are discussed. The fourth Chapter is relevant to multibeam antennas. These radiators constitute a key enabling technique for advanced satellite communication missions. To match the ever growing demand in terms of link performances, frequency reuse and traffic reconfigurability, satellite multibeam antennas are of fundamental importance. Their increased available gain results in a reduction of the on-board required RF power and a simplification of the user terminal. Some recent developments in multi-beam antennas for broadband communications missions are presented here. In the fifth and last Chapter an overview of the issues involved in the design of phased array antennas for high data rate mobile-to-satellite communications is presented. Dielectric Resonator Antennas (DRAs) are here selected as radiators since they are suitable to be used in active integrated antennas. The tuning of the antenna input impedance at the fundamental frequency as well as at higher harmonics is a key point in the design process: therefore, flexible harmonic tuning techniques are devised and implemented.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{critical}} properties of three-dimensional U(1) -symmetric lattice gauge theories. The models apply to various physical systems such as insulating phases of strongly correlated electron systems as well as superconducting and superfluid states of liquid metallic hydrogen under extreme pressures. This thesis contains an introductory part {{and a collection of}} research papers of which seven are published works and one is submitted for publication. Paper I: Critical properties of the 2 + 1 -dimensional compact abelian Higgs model with gauge charge q= 2 are studied. We introduce a novel method of computing the third moment M 3 of the action which allows us to extract correlation length and specific heat critical exponents ν and α without invoking hyperscaling. Finite-size scaling analysis of M 3 yields the ratio (1 +α) /ν and 1 /ν separately. We find that α and ν vary along the critical line of the theory, which however exhibits a remarkable resilience of Z 2 criticality. We conclude that the model is a fixed-line theory, which we propose to characterize the zero temperature quantum phase transition from a Mott-Hubbard insulator to a charge fractionalized insulator in two spatial dimensions. Paper II: Large scale Monte Carlo simulations are employed to study phase transitions in the three-dimensional compact abelian Higgs model in adjoint representations of the matter field, labeled by an integer q, for q= 2, 3, 4, 5. We also study various limiting cases of the model, such as the Z q lattice gauge theory, dual to the 3 DZ q spin model, and the 3 D xy spin model which is dual to the Z q lattice gauge theory in the limit q → ∞. In addition, for benchmark purposes, we study the 2 D square lattice 8 -vertex model, which is exactly solvable and features non-universal critical exponents. The critical exponents α and ν are calculated from finite size scaling of the third moment of the action, and the method is tested thoroughly on models with known values for these exponents. We have found that for q= 3, the three-dimensional compact abelian Higgs model exhibits a second order phase transition line which joins a first order phase transition line at a tricritical point. The results for q= 2 in Paper I are reported with a higher lever of detail. Paper III: This paper is based on a talk by F. S. Nogueira in the Aachen HEP 2003 conference where a review of the results for the compact abelian Higgs model from Paper I and Paper II was presented, as well as the results for the q= 1 case studied by F. S. Nogueira, H. Kleinert and A. Sudbø. Paper IV: We study the effects of a Chern-Simons (CS) term in the phase structure of two different abelian gauge theories in three dimensions. By duality transformations we show how the compact U(1) gauge theory with a CS term for certain values of the CS coupling can be written as a gas of vortex loops interacting through steric repulsion. This theory is known to exhibit a phase transition governed by proliferation of vortex loops. We also employ Monte Carlo simulations to study the non-compact U(1) abelian Higgs model with a CS term. Finite size scaling of the third moment of the action yields critical exponents α and ν that vary continuously with the strength of the CS term, and a comparison with available analytical results is made. Paper V: The critical properties of N-component Ginzburg-Landau theory are studied in d= 2 + 1 dimensions. The model is dualized to a theory of N vortex fields interacting through a Coulomb and a screened potential. The model with N= 2 shows two anomalies in the specific heat. From Monte Carlo simulations we calculate the critical exponents α and ν and the mass of the gauge field. We conclude that one anomaly corresponds to an inverted 3 D xy fixed point, while the other corresponds to a 3 D xy fixed point. There are N fixed points, namely one corresponding to an inverted 3 D xy fixed point, and N- 1 corresponding to neutral 3 D xy fixed points. Applications are briefly discussed. Paper VI: The phase diagram and critical properties of the N-component London superconductor are studied both analytically and through large-scale Monte-Carlo simulations in d= 2 + 1 dimensions. The model with different bare phase stiffnesses for each flavor is a model of superconductivity which should arise out of metallic phases of light atoms under extreme pressure. A projected mixture of electronic and protonic condensates in liquid metallic hydrogen under extreme pressure is the simplest example, corresponding to N= 2 with individually conserved matter fields. We compute critical exponents α and ν for N= 2 and N= 3. The results from Paper V are presented at a higher level of detail. For the arbitrary N case, there are N fixed points,namely one charged inverted 3 D xy fixed point, and N- 1 neutral 3 D xy fixed points. We explicitly identify one charged vortex mode and N- 1 neutral vortex modes. The model for N= 2 and equal bare phase stiffnesses corresponds to a field theoretical description of an easy-plane quantum antiferromagnet. In this case, the critical exponents are computed and found to be non 3 D xy values. Furthermore, we study the model in an external magnetic field, and find a novel feature, namely N- 1 superfluid phases arising out of N charged condensates. In particular, for N= 2 we point out the possibility of two novel types of field-induced phase transitions in ordered quantum fluids: i) A phase transition from a superconductor to a superfluid or vice versa, driven by tuning an external magnetic field. This identifies the superconducting phase of liquid metallic hydrogen as a novel quantum fluid. ii) A phase transition corresponding to a quantum fluid analogue of sublattice melting, where a composite field-induced Abrikosov vortex lattice is decomposed and disorders the phases of the constituent condensate with lowest bare phase stiffness. Both transitions belong to the 3 D xy universality class. Paper VII: We consider the vortex superconductor with two individually conserved condensates in a finite magnetic field. The ground state is a lattice of cocentered vortices in both order parameters. We find two novel phase transitions when temperature is increased at fixed magnetic field. i) A "vortex sublattice melting" transition where vortices in the field with lowest phase stiffness ("light vortices") loose cocentricity with the vortices with large phase stiffness ("heavy vortices"), entering a liquid state (the structure factor of the light vortex sublattice vanishes continuously.) This transition is in the 3 D xy universality class. ii) A first order melting transition of the lattice of heavy vortices in a liquid of light vortices. Paper VIII: We report on large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of a novel type of a vortex matter phase transition which should take place in a three dimensional two-component superconductor. We identify the regime where first, at a certain temperature a field-induced lattice of co-centered vortices of both order parameters melts, causing the system to loose superconductivity. In this state the two-gap system retains a broken composite symmetry and we observe that at a higher temperature it undergoes an extra phase transition where the disordered composite one-flux-quantum vortex lines are "ionized" into a "plasma" of constituent <b>fractional</b> flux vortex <b>lines</b> in individual order parameters. This is the hallmark of the superconductor-to-superfluid-to-normal fluid phase transitions projected to occur in e. g. liquid metallic hydrogen. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
