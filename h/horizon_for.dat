5|$|Night clouds or {{noctilucent clouds}} are tenuous cloud-like {{phenomena}} {{in the upper}} atmosphere. They are made of ice crystals and are only visible in a deep twilight. Noctilucent roughly means night shining in Latin. They are most commonly observed in the summer months at latitudes between 50° and 70° {{north and south of}} the equator. These clouds can be observed only during local summer months and when the Sun is below the <b>horizon</b> <b>for</b> the observer, but while the clouds are still in sunlight.|$|E

5|$|Han dynasty {{emperors}} {{and their}} successors maintained commercial and diplomatic ties with various South and Southeast Asian kingdoms. Han dynasty ships traveled {{as far as}} India, expanding the <b>horizon</b> <b>for</b> new foreign markets for Chinese goods and services through maritime trade within the orbit of the Indian Ocean. Trade relationships were also established between China and foreign empires through the conquered territories. Trade connected China with the Indian Mauryan, Sātavāhana and Shunga Empires, the Persian Parthian Empire, and the European Roman Mediterranean. Roman dancers and entertainers were sent to Luoyang {{as a gift to}} China from a Burmese kingdom in 120. A kingdom referred to in the Book of Han as Huangzhi delivered a rhinoceros in 2 as a tribute. An Indian embassy arrived in China between 89 and 105. Roman merchants from the province of Syria visited Nanyue in 166, Nanjing in 226, and Luoyang in 284. Foreign products have been found at archaeological sites excavating tombs in southern China. Originating with the overseas demand for Chinese silk, the ancient Silk Road trade routes were responsible for the transmission of goods and services as well as ideas between ancient Europe, the Near East, and China.|$|E
5|$|King's first {{target was}} the smaller and slower Waakzaamheid, which was {{windward}} of Furie and thus {{would have to}} sail into the wind to link with Pletz's ship. King rapidly closed with the corvette, avoiding contact with the larger Furie as he did so. At 09:00 Sirius came alongside Waakzaamheid and fired a gun at her, prompting van Neirop to immediately surrender. Furie had not attempted {{to come to the}} flagship's aid and resistance against the much larger Sirius would have been futile. King despatched boats containing a prize crew and removed most of the prisoners from Waakzaamheid, placing them below decks on Sirius. Once the prize was secure, King immediately set off in pursuit of Furie, which was attempting to flee to the west and had nearly disappeared over the <b>horizon.</b> <b>For</b> {{the rest of the day}} the pursuit continued, Furie unable to escape the faster British ship, which steadily gained during the afternoon until at 17:00 was within range of the Dutch frigate.|$|E
5|$|The first crews {{arrived at}} Subic Bay on 11 June and a {{squadron}} office was established. On 12 June 1965, the squadron {{came under the}} operational control of the commander, Vietnam Patrol Force (CTF 71). Administrative control for personnel actions such as pay and personnel records was retained by the Coast Guard. The first cutters arrived at Subic Bay on 17 June and before they were put in the water each hull bottom was inspected, repaired if necessary and painted from the waterline down. Mechanical, ordnance, electrical and electronic maintenance checks were completed before any modifications for duty in Vietnam were attempted. Modifications completed at Subic Bay included new radio transceivers, fabrication of gunner's platforms and ammunition ready boxes for the mortar, the addition of floodlights for night boardings, installation of small arms lockers on the mess deck and addition of sound-powered telephone circuits. Additional bunks and refrigerators were added to increase patrol on-station time. Modifications {{were made to the}} bow-mounted over-under machine gun mortar combination allowing it to be depressed below the <b>horizon</b> <b>for</b> close-range firing. Four additional M-2 machine guns with ready boxes were added to the gunwales of each cutter.|$|E

25|$|Stars (and constellations) {{that are}} {{circumpolar}} in one hemisphere are always {{invisible in the}} high latitudes of the opposite hemisphere, and these never rise above the <b>horizon.</b> <b>For</b> example, the southern circumpolar star Acrux is invisible {{from most of the}} Contiguous United States, likewise, the seven stars of the northern circumpolar Big Dipper asterism are invisible from most of the Patagonia region of South America.|$|E
25|$|From a {{point on}} the ground at this latitude, the sun is above the <b>horizon</b> <b>for</b> 16 hours, 12 minutes during the summer {{solstice}} and 8 hours, 14 minutes during the winter solstice This latitude also roughly corresponds to the minimum latitude in which astronomical twilight can last all night near the summer solstice. Slightly less than 1/8 of the Earth's surface is north of the 49th parallel.|$|E
25|$|Chaumareys {{had decided}} to involve one of the passengers, Richefort, in the {{navigation}} of the frigate. Richefort was a philosopher {{and a member of}} the Philanthropic Society of Cape Verde, but had no qualification to guide ships. As she closed on the coast of Africa, the course of Méduse became dangerous. Richefort apparently mistook a large cloud bank on the <b>horizon</b> <b>for</b> Cape Blanco on the African coast, and so underestimated the proximity of the Bank of Arguin off the coast of Mauritania.|$|E

25|$|The stars within Crux {{were known}} to the Ancient Greeks, where Ptolemy {{regarded}} {{them as part of}} the constellation Centaurus. They were entirely visible as far north as Britain in the fourth millennium BC. However, the precession of the equinoxes gradually lowered the stars below the European horizon, and they were eventually forgotten by the inhabitants of northern latitudes. By AD 400, most of the stars in the constellation we now call Crux never rose above the <b>horizon</b> <b>for</b> Athenians.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{inclination}} of the moon's orbit, {{the moon is}} above the horizon at the North and South Pole for almost two weeks every month, even though the sun is below the <b>horizon</b> <b>for</b> six months at a time. The period from moonrise to moonrise at the poles is quite close to the sidereal period, or 27.3 days. When the sun is the furthest below the horizon (winter solstice), the moon will be full when it is at its highest point.|$|E

25|$|The South Pole {{sees the}} Sun rise and set {{only once a}} year. Due to {{atmospheric}} refraction, these do not occur exactly on the September equinox and the March equinox, respectively: the Sun is above the <b>horizon</b> <b>for</b> four days longer at each equinox. The place has no solar time; there is no daily maximum or minimum solar height above the horizon. The station uses New Zealand time (UTC+12, UTC+13 during daylight saving time) since all flights to McMurdo station depart from Christchurch and, therefore, all official travel from the pole goes through New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|The {{sun sets}} on November 18 or 19, {{and it remains}} below the <b>horizon</b> <b>for</b> about 65 days. This creates a polar night that lasts until the Sun returns to lightly touch the horizon (due to the {{refraction}} and scattering of the atmosphere) by January 22 or January 23. The sun then rises again completely over the horizon by January 27 or 28. During {{the first half of}} the polar night, there is a decreasing amount of twilight each day, and on the winter solstice (around December 21 or December 22), civil twilight in Barrow lasts for a mere 3 hours.|$|E
25|$|Success {{seemed to}} be on the <b>horizon</b> <b>for</b> Odom and Dogpatch USA, but the many {{unforeseen}} events of the 1970s cast a dark shadow on Odom's dreams. Attendance figures throughout that decade were woefully short of expectations. In 1973, interest rates began to skyrocket, and a nationwide energy crisis kept many tourists home. In a bout of cancellations nicknamed the Rural purge, American television networks eliminated many shows with country themes, and the popularity of hillbillies waned. The Li'l Abner restaurant chain was never built. The proposed Li'l Abner TV series was never made; a pilot was produced and premiered as a television special on ABC-TV, but it received poor reviews and no network purchased the series.|$|E
