40|$|There is {{widespread}} {{recognition in the}} accounting literature that properly directed audit effort is critical to an effective and efficient engagement. Auditors assess the risks of managerial misstatements and use these risks to plan audit procedures. Prior studies examining the linkage between assessed risk and audit <b>effort</b> <b>report</b> weak and conflicting results. The unobservable nature of the audit process necessitates the use of proxies to capture assessed risks and audit effort. This study utilizes proprietary audit workpaper data to obtain better measurement of assessed risks and effort. These improved measurements provide stronger evidence on whether changes in assessed risks will affect the nature, timing, and extent of audit testing. This linkage is examined first using OLS and then an instrumental variables approach to address potential simultaneity in determining the nature, timing, and extent of substantive effort. In contrast to prior research, results suggest that auditors vary the nature, timing, and extent of substantive effort in response to assessed auditee risks...|$|E

The study is based primarily on individual <b>effort</b> <b>reports</b> from all Health Sciences units and the educational linkages of four major affiliate hospitals. <b>Effort</b> <b>reporting</b> by faculty, professionals and others is basic and central to cost studies because over 80 % of the costs within academic health centers are based upon wages and salaries. Established procedures and routines are included to identify costs to programs for supplies and equipment as well as indirect costs for all units. The total picture thus includes an analysis of all health center costs on a unit by unit basis which are required to carry out quality programs for the education of health science professionals...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Hardware {{implementation}} quality will {{be considered}} as an important factor for evaluating the NIST SHA- 3 competition candidates in the second round. The most traditional and popular hardware implementation method is designing ASICs with standard cells. However, to benchmark 14 second round SHA- 3 ASIC designs based on a fair and comprehensive methodology can be very challenging because of the undefined application scenarios, various choices of technologies and multiple optimization goals. In this paper we describe a consistent and systematic approach to move a SHA- 3 hardware benchmark process from FPGA prototyping to ASIC implementation, and we present our latest results for ASIC evaluation of the 14 second round SHA- 3 candidates. The <b>effort</b> <b>reported</b> in this paper is complementary to the <b>effort</b> <b>reported</b> in the SHA- 3 conference submission ”How can we conduct fair and consistent hardware evaluation for SHA- 3 candidates? ” [4]. ...|$|R

Section J. 10 of OMB Circular A- 21, “Compensation for Personal Services”, requires UTMB to establish and maintain a payroll distribution system that reasonably distributes salary charges among direct activities. The basic requirement of the Federal cost principles is that salary charges on Sponsored Projects must be proportionate to the Effort expended on those projects, as documented in periodic Effort Confirmations.
