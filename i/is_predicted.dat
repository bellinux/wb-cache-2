5|$|Astatine has an {{electronegativity}} of 2.2 on {{the revised}} Pauling scale– {{lower than that}} of iodine (2.66) and the same as hydrogen. In hydrogen astatide (HAt) the negative charge <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to be on the hydrogen atom, implying that this compound should instead be referred to as astatine hydride. That would be consistent with the electronegativity of astatine on the Allred–Rochow scale (1.9) being less than that of hydrogen (2.2).

5|$|All {{nihonium}} isotopes {{are extremely}} unstable and radioactive; however, the heavier nihonium isotopes are {{more stable than}} the lighter. The most stable known nihonium isotope, 286Nh, is also the heaviest confirmed nihonium isotope; it has a half-life of 8seconds. The isotope 285Nh and the unconfirmed 290Nh {{have been reported to}} also have half-lives of over a second. The isotopes 284Nh and 283Nh have half-lives of 1 and 0.1seconds respectively. The remaining two isotopes have half-lives between 0.1 and 100milliseconds: 282Nh has a half-life of 70milliseconds, and 278Nh, the lightest known nihonium isotope, is also the shortest-lived known nihonium isotope, with a half-life of just 1.4milliseconds. It <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> that even heavier undiscovered nihonium isotopes could be much more stable: for example, 287Nh <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to have a half-life of around 20minutes, close to two orders of magnitude more than that of 286Nh.|$|E
5|$|Although {{francium}} is {{the heaviest}} alkali metal {{that has been}} discovered, {{there has been some}} theoretical work predicting the physical and chemical characteristics of the hypothetical heavier alkali metals. Being the first period 8 element, the undiscovered element ununennium (element 119) <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to be the next alkali metal after francium and behave much like their lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties. Its chemistry <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to be closer to that of potassium or rubidium instead of caesium or francium. This is unusual as periodic trends, ignoring relativistic effects would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and francium. This lowered reactivity is due to the relativistic stabilisation of ununennium's valence electron, increasing ununennium's first ionisation energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii; this effect is already seen for francium. This assumes that ununennium will behave chemically as an alkali metal, which, although likely, may not be true due to relativistic effects. The relativistic stabilisation of the 8s orbital also increases ununennium's electron affinity far beyond that of caesium and francium; indeed, ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it. Relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the polarisability of ununennium. On the other hand, ununennium <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to continue the trend of melting points decreasing going down the group, being expected to have a melting point between 0°C and 30°C.|$|E

Unbinilium <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to continue the trend and have a valence electron configuration of 8s2.

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of ununennium <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> {{to be similar}} to that of the alkali metals, but it would probably behave more like potassium or rubidium than caesium or francium. This is unusual as periodic trends, ignoring relativistic effects, would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and francium. This lowered reactivity is due to the relativistic stabilization of ununennium's valence electron, increasing ununennium's first ionization energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii; this effect is already seen for francium. the {{chemistry of}} ununennium in the +1 oxidation state should be more similar to the chemistry of rubidium than to that of francium. On the other hand, the ionic radius of the Uue+ ion <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to be larger than that of Rb+, because the 7p orbitals are destabilized and are thus larger than the p-orbitals of the lower shells. Ununennium may also show the +3 oxidation state, which is not seen in any other alkali metal, in addition to the +1 oxidation state that is characteristic of the other alkali metals and is also the main oxidation state of all the known alkali metals: this is because of the destabilization and expansion of the 7p3/2 spinor, causing its outermost electrons to have a lower ionization energy than what would otherwise be expected. Many ununennium compounds are expected to have a large covalent character, due to the involvement of the 7p3/2 electrons in the bonding: this effect is also seen to a lesser extent in francium, which shows some 6p3/2 contribution to the bonding in francium superoxide (FrO2). Thus, instead of ununennium being the most electropositive element, as a simple extrapolation would seem to indicate, caesium instead retains this position, with ununennium's electronegativity most likely being close to sodium's (0.93 on the Pauling scale). The standard reduction potential of the Uue+/Uue couple <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to be −2.9V.|$|E

5|$|There {{is another}} {{opportunity}} for tennessine to complete its octet—by forming a covalent bond. Like the halogens, when two tennessine atoms meet {{they are expected}} to form a Ts–Ts bond to give a diatomic molecule. Such molecules are commonly bound via single sigma bonds between the atoms; these are different from pi bonds, which are divided into two parts, each shifted in a direction perpendicular to the line between the atoms, and opposite one another rather than being located directly between the atoms they bind. Sigma bonding has been calculated to show a great antibonding character in the At2 molecule and is not as favorable energetically. Tennessine <b>is</b> <b>predicted</b> to continue the trend; a strong pi character should be seen in the bonding of Ts2.
