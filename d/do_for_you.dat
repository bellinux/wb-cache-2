500|$|Truman {{had been}} vice {{president}} for 82 days when President Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945. That afternoon, Truman presided over the Senate as usual. He had just adjourned the session {{for the day and}} was preparing to have a drink in House Speaker Sam Rayburn's office when he received an urgent message to go immediately to the White House. Truman assumed President Roosevelt wanted to meet with him, but Eleanor Roosevelt informed him her husband had died after suffering a massive cerebral hemorrhage. Truman's first concern was for Mrs. Roosevelt. He asked if there was anything he could do for her, to which she replied, [...] "Is there anything we can <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>you?</b> For you are the one in trouble now!" ...|$|E
500|$|To {{the south}} of Egypt, Djedkare also sent an {{expedition}} to the fabled Land of Punt to procure the myrrh used as incense in the Egyptian temples. The expedition to Punt is {{referred to in the}} letter from Pepi II Neferkare to Harkuf some 100 years later. Harkuf had reported that he would bring back a [...] "dwarf of the god's dancers from the land of the horizon dwellers". Pepi mentions that the god's sealbearer Werdjededkhnum had returned from Punt with a dwarf during the reign of Djedkare Isesi and had been richly rewarded. The decree mentions that [...] "My Majesty will <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> something greater than what was done for the god's sealbearer Werdjededkhnum in the reign of Isesi, reflecting my majesty's yearning to see this dwarf".|$|E
500|$|Ross was {{impressed}} with the in-camera effects achieved for the series, but he would always propose visual effect alternatives to these on set because [...] "you have to embrace what VFX can <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> The cost of spending half a day on a special scene has got to be worth it, or else you can just shoot a plate and do the rest in post and save yourself all that production time". Ross photographed all the series' sets as reference footage to work from in case a visual effect shot was ultimately required, explaining, [...] "Sometimes while looking at the assembly I’ll realize we need another shot but there isn’t any coverage that works. [...] us a starting point for building our new shots. And whether they are all-CG or just elements, we are always dealing with Noah’s aesthetic of making it look as real as possible." ...|$|E

I have slaved <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> the last twelve years. No mother ever sacrificed herself for her child more than I have <b>done</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> and now see the return I get. I sometimes think that it will kill me." ...|$|R

500|$|Seacole visited Nightingale at the Barrack Hospital in Scutari, {{where she}} asked for a bed for the night, because she {{intended}} to travel to Balaclava {{the next day to}} join her business partner. In her memoirs, she reported that her meeting with Nightingale was friendly, with Nightingale asking [...] "What do you want, Mrs. Seacole? Anything we can <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>you?</b> If it lies in my power, I shall be very happy." [...] Seacole told her of her [...] "dread of the night journey by caique" [...] and the improbability of being able to find the Hollander in the dark. A bed was then found for her and breakfast sent her in the morning, with a [...] "kind message" [...] from Mrs. Bracebridge, Nightingale's helper. A footnote in the memoir states that Seacole subsequently [...] "saw much of Miss Nightingale at Balaclava," [...] but no further meetings are recorded in the text.|$|E
500|$|The Canadian {{government}} declined Mitsui's {{offer of}} military service. [...] A series of Orders in Council in 1942 deprived Canadians of Japanese descent {{of their property}} and rights, culminating in Japanese-Canadian internment {{for the duration of}} the war. [...] The government confiscated the Mitsui family's 17-acre property and poultry facilities in Coquitlam and sold it off, compensating the family with an estimated one-third of its total value. [...] The RCMP took Mitsui and his daughter Lucy to Hastings Park for registration as an enemy alien. [...] Mitsui wore his military medals and when the registering official asked him, [...] "What can I <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> Sarge?", Mitsui responded, [...] "What are you doing to me? I served my country. [...] You've taken everything away from me.... What are the good of my medals?" [...] He scattered his medals on the floor and table, and refused to wear them thereafter when they were returned to him. [...] He and his family were detained in a facility in Greenwood, British Columbia. [...] Mitsui later stated, [...] "I had complete confidence in the government that they wouldn't be doing anything to me because of being a veteran." [...] All the family could later retrieve was a samurai sword Mitsui's son George had buried.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the female}} protagonists {{challenge}} their male [...] "suitors" [...] {{to keep up}} instead of being full of empty promises; the women further feel that [...] "He's not fulfilling you like he says". Williams further explained {{the meaning of the}} song during an interview with MTV News, [...] "We've had experiences with men doing a lot of talking but they can’t back it up. You said you could do this, but you can't, whether that's on the dance floor or wherever else. He said what he could <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> but..." [...] The lyrics are constructed in the chorus-verse pattern. The song opens with the lines [...] "Hit me" [...] and the first verses sung by Beyoncé follow: [...] "I put it right there made it easy for you to get to / Now you want to act like you don't know what to do". The chorus follows during which the group repeatedly sings the lines [...] "Can you keep up?". Rowland's second verses follow where she sings the lines [...] "Put it on me deep in the right direction". The chorus is repeated twice before the bridge by Williams. After the bridge, the group sings the lines [...] "Here's your papers, baby you are dismissed" [...] letting their man know that he is not good enough for them. Rowland sings a short ad lib, and then the trio ends with a repeated chorus. Nick Reynolds from BBC compared the song Missy Elliott's [...] "Pass That Dutch" [...] and to songs by The Supremes. He further found a name check of Public Enemy's [...] "Bring the Noise". Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine also compared [...] "Lose My Breath with [...] "Pass That Dutch".|$|E

2500|$|Bow Wow had {{publicly}} {{announced his}} interpretation of the song's meaning as he stated {{in an interview with}} MTV: [...] "Basically the song is me talking to a girl and telling her, 'These are the things I can <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> Let me hold you down. This is what I want to <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> as a man. These are the things I'm capable of doing for you if you get with me. Just hear me out.' I'm just really talking to the ladies. The song is really special to me, and I love that song." [...] The collaboration began when Bow Wow was talking with producer Jermaine Dupri about the song and how he suggested on getting Omarion to appear on the track.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Nehemiah {{cited the}} use of the words [...] "will bring you out" [...] in [...] to {{demonstrate}} that using the word hamotzi in the blessing over bread would mean that God [...] "will bring forth" [...] bread from the land – not that God [...] "has brought forth" [...] bread from the land. Rabbi Nehemiah thus read [...] to mean: [...] "I am the Lord, the One Who will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians." [...] The Gemara reported that the Rabbis of a Baraita, however, read [...] to mean: [...] "When I shall bring you out, I will <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> something that will show you that I am the One Who brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians." ...|$|E
2500|$|Also in 1987, Orbison was {{inducted}} into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and initiated into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Bruce Springsteen, who concluded his speech with a reference to his own album [...] "Born to Run": [...] "I wanted a record with words like Bob Dylan that sounded like Phil Spector—but, most of all, I wanted to sing like Roy Orbison. Now, everyone knows that no one sings like Roy Orbison." [...] In response, Orbison asked Springsteen for a copy of the speech, and said of his induction that he felt [...] "validated" [...] by the honor. A few months later, Orbison and Springsteen paired again to film a concert at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub in Los Angeles. They were joined by Jackson Browne, T Bone Burnett, Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, Bonnie Raitt, Jennifer Warnes, James Burton, and k.d. lang. Lang later recounted how humbled Orbison had been by the display of support from so many talented and busy musicians: [...] "Roy looked at all of us and said, 'If there is anything I can ever <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> please call on me'. He was very serious. It was his way of thanking us. It was very emotional." [...] The concert was filmed in one take and aired on Cinemax under the title it was released on video by Virgin Records, selling 50,000 copies.|$|E
