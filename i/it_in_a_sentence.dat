30|$|Low-degree {{saturation}} is {{a common}} deviation from the power-law behavior. This indicates that we have fewer small degree nodes than expected for a pure power-law. This saturation is proposed {{to be caused by}} the initial attractiveness concept, increasing the linking probability of new nodes to the small-degree nodes, which pushes the small-k nodes towards higher degrees (Barabási 2016). The reflection of this concept to the networks studied here may be explained with the highly connective linking procedure of the sentence collocation networks, which immediately increases the degree of a new node by the number of the words <b>it</b> collocates <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence.</b> By the way, the peak k value of the distribution graph may give an idea about the mean length of the sentences for that media.

Structural ambiguity occurs when a phrase or sentence has more than one underlying structure. The phrase can be disambiguated by putting <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> with some sort of formal signals which help the reader or hearer to recognize the sentence structure. Some of the signals include function words, inflections, affixes, stress, juncture, and punctuation.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we will examine Kuno 2 ̆ 7 s theory on {{negation}} in Japanese.

His analysis of negation in Japanese is mainly based on the concepts of foci and the scope of negation. But exactly how these two concepts are involved in negation (or not) is still in debate. There is another issue in his analysis that has often been argued in literature. He proposes that negative sentences in Japanese be classified into two types of information structures. However, as he himself admits, he uses these concepts without rigid definition. There are two purposes in this paper. One {{is to show that}} the two information structures he made a distinction of can be resolved into a relationship between foci and alternative sets of them.

40|$|The {{question}} of how a computer reading a text can go from a word to its meaning is an open and difficult one. The WordNet[3] lexical database uses a system of nested supersets to allow programs to be specific as to what meaning of a word they are using, but a system that picks the correct meaning is still necessary. In an attempt to capture the human understanding of this problem and produce a system that can achieve this goal with minimal starting information, I created the DISAMBIGUATOR program. DISAMBIGUATOR uses Lattice Learning to capture the concept of contexts, which represent common situations that multiple words are found in, and uses Genesis' system of Things, Sequences, Derivative and Relations to understand some contexts as being related to others (i. e. that 'things which can fly to a tree' and 'things which can fly to Spain' are related {{in that they are}} both special cases of the context 'things which can fly'). Using this system, DISAMBIGUATOR can tell us which meaning of 'hawk' we should use if we see <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> like 'the hawk flew to the tree.

40|$|AbstractThis article {{sought to}} propose proper {{pedagogical}} means of teaching vocabulary {{without resorting to}} the use of L 1 (Francophone learners⿿ Mother Tongue) or L 2 (French language) when teaching Francophone learners English Language at all levels. It was revealed that adopting context clues or explanation techniques as well as concrete techniques in explaining new words or expressions was the most effective methodological approach in teaching vocabulary. Also, it has been uncovered didactically and pedagogically that the more senses are used to comprehend a word, the greater the likelihood of learning being successful. Thus if learners see a word, (as real pictures), feel the word (touching the thing), taste the word (by the way of eating) as well as hear <b>it</b> used <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> to show meaning, it would lead to retention and memorization of the vocabulary.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{dedicated}} to the reinvestigation {{of the role of the}} particle lɛɛw 45 <b>in</b> Thai. <b>It</b> raises speculations over the conventional claims according to which lɛɛw 45 plays <b>a</b> role <b>in</b> temporality as <b>a</b> perfective aspect marker (Kanchanawan, 1978; Boonyapatipark, 1983; among others). The reappraisal of the role of lɛɛw 45 in this study, which is based on the use of <b>it</b> <b>in</b> present day Thai, offers an argument against these claims. The addition of lɛɛw 45 to <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> is not mainly aimed at temporal effects. When <b>it</b> appears <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence,</b> lɛɛw 45 does not necessarily denote the perfective aspect of the event. Moreover, it can be omitted in the sentence in which perfectivity is already inherited through the lexical aspect of the verb and the temporal structure of the predicate. Lɛɛw 45 <b>in</b> fact plays <b>a</b> role as a marker of counter-expectation. It represents a previous expectation about the subject and its opposition to the asserted proposition. Examining the nature of lɛɛw 45 's implications thoroughly, the study has found that even though the definiteness of the subject behaves like a standard presupposition, the implicated expectation does not project in all cases. This is revealed in the results from Tonhauser et al. ’s (2013) projection tests. Lɛɛw 45 is context-sensitive and imposes a Strong Contextual Felicity constraint. Nonetheless, it is actually not bound to Obligatory Local Effect and its presence in the context where the projective contents are not entailed is also felicitous. Counter-expectations also involve coherence and relevance, which are determined by the interrelationship between common ground, context, and focus. The asserted proposition is required to correspond to the common ground knowledge and context designated by the expected proposition. Additionally, the expression and interpretation of lɛɛw 45 's counter-expectations rely on the association of lɛɛw 45 with the focused element in its scope. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> particular case, the common ground knowledge, context, and focus can be identified with the assistance of Question Under Discussion (Roberts 1996, 2012). The mechanism also accounts for the production and interpretation processes proceeding in accordance with the conversational moves. ...|$|R
40|$|Children {{may be able}} to gain partial {{information}} about the meaning of a word from clues, such as how <b>it</b> is used <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> and what words it is contrasted with. This strategy, known as "fast mapping, " may provide a very useful first step in language learning. One question which arises from studies of fast mapping is whether fast mapping is available to children across various semantic domains, such as shape, texture, and color. A total of 50 children (with a mean age of 3 years, 8 months) participated in the first study, and 33 children (with a mean age of 2 years, 9 months) participated in the second. Children were introduced to a novel color, shape, or texture term by contrasting the new term with a well-known word from that domain. They were then tested for both their ability to produce and comprehend the new term and whether they knew the semantic domain the word referred to. The data show that children can gain some {{information about}} the meaning of a word from <b>a</b> brief encounter. <b>In</b> contrast to rather slow and difficult hypothesis-testing mechanisms, fast mapping may allow the child to rapidly obtain information from the situation.

5000|$|It {{also has}} been argued that the syntax of <b>sentences</b> is not <b>a</b> {{reliable}} guide to their ontological commitments because English has no form of words which reliably functions to make <b>an</b> existence-claim <b>in</b> every context <b>in</b> which <b>it</b> is used. For example, Jody Azzouni suggests that [...] "There is" [...] does not make any kind of genuine existence-claim when <b>it</b> is used <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> such as [...] "There are mice that talk". Since the meaning of the existential quantifier in formal notation is usually explained in terms of its equivalence to English expressions such as [...] "there is" [...] and [...] "there exist", and since these English expressions are not reliably ontologically committing, it comes to seem that we cannot be sure of our theory's ontological commitments even after it has been regimented into a canonical formulation. This argument has been attacked by Howard Peacock, who suggests that Azzouni's strategy conflates two different kinds of ontological commitment - one which is intended as a measure of what a theory explicitly claims to exist, and one which is intended as a measure of what is required for the theory to be true; what the ontological costs of the theory are. If ontological commitment is thought of as a matter of the ontological costs of a theory, then it is possible that <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> may be ontologically committed to an entity even though competent speakers of the language do not recognize the sentence as asserting the existence of that entity. Ontological commitment {{is not a matter of}} what commitments one explicitly recognizes, but rather a matter of what commitments are actually incurred.|$|R
40|$|It {{is argued}} (a) that laws are assurances of protections {{of rights and}} (b) that governments are protectors of rights. Lest those assurances be empty and thus not really be assurances at all, laws must be {{enforced}} and governments must therefore {{have the power to}} coerce. For this reason, the government of a given region tends to have, as Max Weber put it, a "monopoly on power" in that region. And because governments are power-monopolizers, it is tempting to think that the concepts of government and law are to be understood in terms of the concept of power. In actuality, the first two concepts are to be understood primarily in terms of the concept of morality [...] of rights-protection, to be specific [...] and only secondarily in terms of the concept of power. Contentions (a) and (b) appear to be inconsistent with obvious facts (e. g. the fact that Pol Pot's regime violated the rights of those over whom it had power). But (a) and (b) are compatible with those facts. This is a consequence of two principles. First, moral requirements have a "dimension of weight," as Dworkin put it, meaning that one moral imperative can be outweighed, without being obliterated, by another moral imperative. Second, sentential operators can have different degrees of scope. "It is hereby assured that" is such an operator. Linguistic surface structure may obfuscate the degree of scope that <b>it</b> has <b>in</b> <b>a</b> given <b>sentence.</b> That fact compatibilizes our analysis with {{the fact that there are}} evil laws and evil governments...|$|R
