Wang explains this means [...] "with a certain possibility, that her fetus {{has a kind of}} genetic problem.

[...] Dr. Diana Bianchi of Tufts disputes the possibility of the test being used for such a diagnosis. She says, [...] "The test involves looking at genetic sequences on the X chromosome and the Y chromosome. If he gave a diagnosis of Trisomy 18, that involves a different chromosome, Chromosome 18. That is certainly something that is not advertised in the packaging associated with the test. [...] "It is possible that, upon being told of a problem by Acu-Gen, a woman may seek to have an amniocentesis or other invasive procedure which may be an unnecessary risk if the Acu-Gen diagnosis was in error. In this case, the woman delivered a healthy baby free from both Trisomy 18 and Down syndrome.|$|E

External competitiveness is also assessed by the fiscal policy impact onto current account balance.

She uses her pocket-money to buy a train ticket, endures a sleepless journey of two days, then walks three miles from the station in the cold and wet to the house on Lantern Hill. Her father, astonished, assures her that he is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get a divorce or remarry; he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Boston to meet with publishers about a book of his that has been accepted. Jane then catches pneumonia and her father sends a telegram to her mother. Robin, ignoring her mother's command of staying in Toronto, goes to the island to be with Jane. Jane's father falls in love with her mother all over again on first sight, and when Jane awakens, her parents have reconciled. As the book ends, Jane is happily making plans for her reunited family who will spend half the year in Toronto and half on Lantern Hill.|$|R
3000|$|It’s {{possible}} {{to construct an}} ideology, and I’ve occasionally tried to, in which you combine {{the notion of the}} world as not controllable with the notion that you’re still <b>going</b> <b>to</b> act decisively. I attribute that to people like Don Quixote, but even more people to Chinese philosophy. The thread that runs through Chinese philosophy that fascinates me is the thread that says the leader should be decisive, but skeptical. They should act firmly, but not be very sure that he’s acting correctly. Westerners have great difficulty doing both of those. I used to call it optimism without hope (March 1999). You strike ahead forward, even though {{in the back of your}} head, you say, “I don’t have the vaguest idea if this is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make any difference.” If you can do that, if you can combine those two, I think you’re closer to being able to survive well. Most of our training is that in order to have great action, you have to have great hopes. A lot of reasons I’m somewhat enthusiastic about that Chinese tradition is that it allows you to have great action without having great hope. “I’m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> charge, <b>probably</b> won’t make any difference, but that’s what I’m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do.” [...]...|$|R

2500|$|Irenaeus {{does not}} simply parrot back the message of Paul in his {{understanding}} of salvation. One of the major changes that Irenaeus makes is when the Parousia will occur. [...] Paul states that he believes that it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen soon, <b>probably</b> in his own lifetime [...] However, the end times does not happen immediately and Christians begin to worry and have doubts about the faith. For Irenaeus, sin is seen as haste, just as Adam and Eve quickly ate from the tree of knowledge as they pleased. On the other hand, redemption restored to humanity through the Christ's submission to God’s will. Thus, the salvation of man will also be restored to the original trajectory controlled by God forfeited in humanity's sinful in haste. This rather slower version of salvation {{is not something that}} Irenaeus received from Paul, but was a necessary construct given the delay of the second coming of Jesus.|$|R

I have seen him every day without one exception, and have learnt a very great deal from him. He has studied very closely school work, condition of the labourer, boys' homes, best method of dispensing charity, &c., and on all these points his advice has been really invaluable. I feel now that I am quite to all intents working the district. People ask me about their children coming to school. I know almost all the people in the village, and a good many out of it, and begin to understand, in a very small way, what a clergyman's life is. A mixture of sorrow and pleasure indeed! There are many very sad cases of hypocrisy, filthiness, and wickedness (as I suppose there are in every district); and yesterday I had a very hard-working and in one case most painful day.|$|R

In contrast to her first record which featured music described by the singer as [...] "very brash and very sassy and very unapologetic and irreverent", she says the second album makes a lyrical departure and explores a more vulnerable side in its lyrics. She explained: [...] "I have learned {{over the past three}} years of doing this that being vulnerable doesn't mean you're weak. I very much want to be seen as a strong woman, but I realize that vulnerability can also be a strength. So on my next record, you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> hear <b>probably</b> a little more of that." [...] Kesha commented, in an interview with Rolling Stone, [...] "The first two records talked more about partying, which is a great, magical part of life, but some songs on the new record are more personal and vulnerable. And you can hear more of the music I listen to when I'm lying in my bed. I'm not claiming that it's a rock record - but as long as it's fucking good, you can call it whatever you want." [...] Co-written by her mother, Pebe Sebert, the song titled [...] "Gold Trans Am" [...] doubles as a metaphor for her vagina and alludes to her actual automobile. Of the song, Kesha said: [...] "It began as a song about my car, which is a gold Trans Am, and it works about 40 per cent of the time. I don't have another car because I love that one so much. But then like all great pop it became a metaphor for something else - my pussy." ...|$|R
