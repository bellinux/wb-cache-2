5|$|Thumbelina {{tries to}} protect herself from the elements, but when winter comes, she is in desperate straits.

The field mouse keeps pushing Thumbelina into the marriage, saying the mole is a good match for her, and does not listen to her protests.|$|E

5|$|Zhao Mo was {{grateful}} for the speed of the intervention against Minyue.
