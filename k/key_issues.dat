5|$|As {{a last-ditch}} effort to avert a lockout, owners and players met again on June 30, 2011, to negotiate, but both sides failed to reach a {{resolution}} on <b>key</b> <b>issues</b> like salary cap and BRI splits. Both Stern and Hunter said that the two sides remained far apart. The owners demanded a larger share, claiming that they were losing money. The players, on the other hand, were willing to make concessions, but they refused to completely cave in to owners' demands. Negotiations broke off, and the CBA expired at midnight.|$|E
5|$|<b>Key</b> <b>issues</b> include {{how much}} footage was shot; {{that it was}} blurred at the moment Jamal and Muhammad were hit; that France2 cut a few seconds in which the boy moves; and that the {{cameraman}} stopped filming at that point.

There is no film {{of the death of}} the first ambulance driver, Bassam al-Bilbeisi, who was reportedly shot on his way to pick them up.|$|E

5|$|The other {{defining}} {{aspect of}} Turkey's {{foreign policy is}} the country's long-standing strategic alliance with the United States. The common threat posed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War led to Turkey's membership of NATO in 1952, ensuring close bilateral relations with Washington. Subsequently Turkey benefited from the United States' political, economic and diplomatic support, including in <b>key</b> <b>issues</b> such as the country's bid to join the European Union. In the post–Cold War environment, Turkey's geostrategic importance shifted towards its proximity to the Middle East, the Caucasus and the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|American {{economist}} and former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker {{has argued that}} the lack of global consensus on <b>key</b> <b>issues</b> threatens efforts to reform the global financial system. He has argued that quite possibly the most important issue is a unified approach to addressing failures of systemically important financial institutions, noting public taxpayers and government officials have grown disillusioned with deploying tax revenues to bail out creditors for the sake of stopping contagion and mitigating economic disaster. Volcker has expressed an array of potential coordinated measures: increased policy surveillance by the IMF and commitment from nations to adopt agreed-upon best practices, mandatory consultation from multilateral bodies leading to more direct policy recommendations, stricter controls on national qualification for emergency financing facilities (such as those offered by the IMF or by central banks), and improved incentive structures with financial penalties.|$|E

However, current IBC-based solutions were not addressing the problem of secure private <b>key</b> <b>issuing.</b> In this {{paper we propose a}} novel secure <b>key</b> <b>issuing</b> scheme for P 2 P networks using IBC. We present an IBC infrastructure setup phase, a peer registration solution using Shamir’s (k, n) secret sharing scheme, and a secure <b>key</b> <b>issuing</b> scheme, which adopts key generate centre (KGC) and key privacy authorities (KPAs) to <b>issue</b> private <b>keys</b> to peers securely.
