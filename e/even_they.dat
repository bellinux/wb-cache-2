5|$|Common titanium-containing {{minerals}} are anatase, brookite, ilmenite, perovskite, rutile, and titanite (sphene). Akaogiite is {{an extremely}} rare mineral consisting of titanium dioxide. Of these minerals, only rutile and ilmenite have economic importance, yet <b>even</b> <b>they</b> are difficult to find in high concentrations. About 6.0 and 0.7 million tonnes of those minerals were mined in 2011, respectively. Significant titanium-bearing ilmenite deposits exist in western Australia, Canada, China, India, Mozambique, New Zealand, Norway, Sierra Leone, South Africa, and Ukraine. About 186,000 tonnes of titanium metal sponge were produced in 2011, mostly in China (60,000 t), Japan (56,000 t), Russia (40,000 t), United States (32,000 t) and Kazakhstan (20,700 t). Total reserves of titanium are estimated to exceed 600 million tonnes.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{receiving}} a home draw {{in each of}} their first four rounds (Third to Sixth), United were paired against difficult opponents throughout the competition. On their route to the final they defeated five Premier League teams: Middlesbrough, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal and Newcastle United. The only non-Premier League team that United played in the competition was Fulham, {{who at the time}} played in the Second Division, the third tier of English football, but <b>even</b> <b>they</b> were not considered pushovers, having claimed shock wins over Southampton and Aston Villa in the previous rounds.|$|E
5|$|The CIA Damage Assessment Team (DAT) {{reviewed}} {{the credibility of}} all of the Agency's Soviet agents from the mid-1980s onward, then separated them into three groups: those who Ames admitted to betraying but continued providing intelligence; those whom Ames was suspected of betraying and those whom Ames' spying may have helped the Soviets identify; and the agents whom neither Ames nor Moscow uncovered. The DAT thus deemed intelligence supplied by the first group suspicious, although investigators acknowledged that it may have included genuine material as feed. The debate over the second group's bona fides proved especially contentious, while the information from the third group of agents was considered credible despite some concerns that <b>even</b> <b>they</b> may have been compromised.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{reaching}} to Gujarat, Swaminarayan by His preaching and super natural divine power restored noted notorious criminals as normal civilians. These criminals left their evil nature and started living life with high moral values {{to the extent}} that they would never rob, or kill any living being. <b>Even</b> <b>they</b> would not see the unknown women or would not drink alcohol and be strict vegetarian. Bombay Governor Sir Malcolm was impressed by social reforms of Swaminarayan and so had come down to Rajkot to meet Swaminarayan personally and to appreciate His work towards educating high moral values to the people of Gujarat and helping British Government in reducing criminal graph of Gujarat. Swaminarayan had vowed not to kill the evil people but to kill their evil nature.|$|E

25|$|Consider two even {{integers}} x and y. Since {{they are}} <b>even,</b> <b>they</b> {{can be written}} as x=2a and y=2b, respectively, for integers a and b. Then the sum x+y= 2a+2b= 2(a+b). Therefore x+y has 2 as a factor and, by definition, is even. Hence the sum of any two even integers is even.|$|E

25|$|Gods can be thus {{categorized}} into embodied gods {{also known}} as arihantas and non-embodied formless gods who are called Siddhas. Jainism considers the devīs and devas to be souls who dwell in heavens owing to meritorious deeds in their past lives.

25|$|Most Anglican cathedrals in Canada are modest parish {{churches and}} it is only the cathedrals of Toronto, (St. George's Cathedral), Montreal, Kingston, Halifax, St. John's, and Victoria which have {{significant}} dimensions or imposing designs, though <b>even</b> <b>they</b> are modest by European or even Australian standards. Diocesan services are often held in Roman Catholic or United churches because of the limited seating in most Anglican cathedrals.|$|E
25|$|The Stationmaster and The Postmaster – Both {{officials}} {{attend the}} Gayevs' party in Act III.

25|$|Until {{the early}} 19th century, {{there were only}} a few {{craftsmen}} and merchants in the town, because they had to pay taxes to the bishop who owned the city. By the 1830s 10% of the residents of the mostly Roman Catholic town were Jewish, but <b>even</b> <b>they</b> did not give a boost to trade. Because of this, even though the town was the centre of administration, economically and culturally it wasn't really important. Even though it had about 3,500 residents, it had only two primary schools. The cultural centres of the comitatus were Kanizsa and Keszthely.|$|E

Alistair Campbell and Grant Flower had also faced Waqar Younis at his peak, and Wasim Akram and the Pakistani pace battery before this. They had in fact played a full 3-Test series in January 1995, when they had won their first Test match, thrashing Pakistan by an innings and 64 runs and scoring 544/4 declared in their only innings.

Lochlann was already benefactor to four {{religious}} houses in Galloway that included his own Cistercian establishment of Glenluce Abbey as well as being associated with Holyrood Abbey in Edinburgh and the Cumbrian abbey of Holmcultram and the priory of St Bees.|$|E

25|$|When the Italians reoccupied Zones II and III in XXX 1941, {{they assumed}} control {{of about one}} third of the {{territory}} of the NDH, and ordered all Ustaše militia units (who they accused of excesses against the Serb population of the NDH) and most Home Guard units to withdraw from those zones. The NDH government protested vigorously, but the Italians would not relent, and used auxiliary Chetnik units to maintain the peace in those zones instead. In fact, even in September 1942, no more than about 1,000 Ustaše militia members were in Zone II, and <b>even</b> <b>they</b> were under close Italian command and supervision.|$|E
25|$|The book {{opens with}} a {{historical}} note about the prophet, then a short oracle announcing Yahweh's (i.e., God)'s judgement (repeated in the Book of Joel.

Included in this, with no apparent order, are an oracle {{on the nature of}} prophecy, snippets of hymns, oracles of woe, a third-person prose narrative concerning the prophet, and an oracle promising restoration of the House of David, which had not yet fallen in Amos's lifetime.|$|E
25|$|The second group, {{the land}} hermit crabs, {{spend most of}} their life on land as {{terrestrial}} species in tropical areas, though <b>even</b> <b>they</b> require access to both freshwater and saltwater to keep their gills damp or wet to survive and to reproduce. They belong to the family Coenobitidae. Of the approximately 15 terrestrial species of genus Coenobita in the world, the following are commonly kept as pets: Caribbean hermit crab (Coenobita clypeatus), Australian land hermit crab (Coenobita variabilis), and the Ecuadorian hermit crab (Coenobita compressus). Other species, such as Coenobita brevimanus, Coenobita rugosus, Coenobita perlatus or Coenobita cavipes, are less common but growing in availability and popularity as pets.|$|E
